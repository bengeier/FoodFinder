{"text":"Meh. Tricolored chips? Really? Salsa? No taste except for spiciness. The $10 for the \"Hand squeezed margarita\" was money poorly spent for what was clearly a margarita made with a mix. The menu is sparse, with not too much of a selection and a la carte items starting at $7. The servers are clearly instructed to up sell, but we did appreciate the attention. The food came, and it was incredibly bland except for the one note punch of heat and the blanket of cheese on top. Two stars for the service, the tortilla and the portions, which are hearty. Overall, not worth the $42 for two people plus tip. Never again."}
{"text":"Food: Good but most entrees are spicy. Also not too many choices for vegetarians... Prices aren't too bad.  Setting: The decor's tacky to the nth degree. Chandeliers made from beer bottles, plastic vegetables hanging down from the ceiling etc. The place looks like a junk yard... Also they had some mist/water coming down in their outside seating area. Ladies, if you straighten your hair, don't come here...  Service: Seemed slow for most tables but I did tell the waiter to hurry it up. He brought the food in 9 mins... Yes I timed him. :)"}
{"text":"The service is horrible. Do not go here for dinner, unless you have a lot of time. It took 2 hours just to get food. Once it gets there the food I good but you have to put up with the people"}
{"text":"We stopped in because we were told Los Dos Molinos had good food. I am so disappointed in this restaurant. When we first walked in we thought it looked cute, then we began noticing things like the dirty tables and floors that were not being cleared. We were sat at a poorly cleaned table and given sticky menus. They dropped water and chips at our table quickly and then we didnt see our server for several long minutes. The bar was a sore site to look at. Even from a raised chair I couldn't see what alcohol they had. I wasn't enticed to buy anything. The bar counter itself looked extremely dirty as well. I would not have eaten there. The host acted as the bar tender and it was clear he was not trained as a bar tender. He was placing his hands and fingers in dishes and mixes where they should not have been. Their margaritas looked so weak that you could see straight through them. Most drinks were served out of a machine instead of being mixed by a bar tender. The ceiling had wires sticking out of it and there were fridges with open sides that looked gross. Nothing was lit in the bar. It was the last thing anyone would focus on in the restaurant. The cook ran our food to us, and it was apparent that it had been sitting for a while. The plate was extremely hot and the cheese was melted and burned so bad I had to use a steak knife to cut it. I ordered two beef tacos and my date ordered a guacamole tostada with sour cream on the side. My beef tacos were the most tasteless thing I've eaten in a while. I'm not sure how you can make beef so bland and tasteless. The guacamole tostada came with extra guacamole instead of sour cream. It looked like a plate of guacamole with a few beans visible on the side. My date wanted the sour cream she ordered and some lemons, but never even had the chance to request them as we were not checked on a single time after we got our food. Our waters and soda were never refilled, and no service was actually provided. Once we were done we waited just under 20 minutes to be able to pay our bill. We made it blatantly clear we were ready to go and nothing, no one checked on us. Their flan sounded good but I didn't want to wait an hour for an order. When we were finally able to pay, the server, previously absent until now, stood at our table with an iPad we had to pay on until we paid. We were not able to comfortably talk about paying the bill or tipping. The server was nowhere to be found when we needed service, however he wouldn't leave us once they wanted money. We left disappointed and aggravated that our date night was off to a sour start. As someone with extensive experience in the food and service industry this restaurant is pitiful and embarrassing."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and have never been overly impressed. It's just okay.  The drinks may be good, and the salsa hot, but I can't justify the wait.  I once ordered chicken tacos only to have them show up in pre-made shells. I was shocked. I think there are plenty of other great places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, funky decor and really good service. Most menu items are very spicy, but there are lots of interesting options. Great happy hour too!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, better than Macayos. The parking sucks though, and it's right next to a windshield repair shop so parking is even tighter. The atmosphere is so-so, so if you are in the mood for Mexican I would choose this if you are between the 101/202 and the 60/alma school, but don't expect to be swept off your feet."}
{"text":"Just absolutely love their green chili stew.  This stuff is da bomb.  You get a huge serving (enough for take-home leftovers, which are even better the next day), and the sopapillas that come as a side are also awesome."}
{"text":"Best New Mexican food around. It is quite hot and spicy, but has great flavor. I especially enjoyed the salsa and the margarita's are good as well. Only downfall is it's location. Hard to find and in a neighborhood that i wouldn't be in if i wasn't lost looking for Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"After writing my poor review in Dec 2014 about Los Dos Molinos in which I promised to never go back, I've stuck to my word and pleased to not give my business to this establishment."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is the best definition of a hole in the wall with the best Mexican food ever I know of. Spicy spicy with the perfect blend of the best tasting Mexican food ever. Maricella always knows what we want. Try it once and it will be your favorite food forever"}
{"text":"We love this place. I give it four stars instead of five because if you don't like spicy hot, there isn't much to choose. For those of us to do, it's great. Don't let the shabby outside appearance fool you. Good food and staff inside."}
{"text":"One of the Arizona things we miss most after moving to Southern California is regular doses of great food from Los Dos Molinos.  Back in the day we frequented the Mesa and South Mountain locations and enjoyed the food prepared by Victoria and her family.  Today we dropped in on the newest family location in Ahwatukee and were delighted to get reacquainted with Cheryl and her staff.  Everything was wonderfully prepared and piping hot from the kitchen.  When we inquired about a favorite dessert that wasn't on the menu  -- fried tortilla strips powdered with cinnamon sugar and drizzled with honey -- Cheryl offered to make them for us special.  What a great ending to an amazing lunch.  The food exceeded our pleasant memories and we couldn't have been more warmly greeted.  No menu recommendations are needed because everything is flavorful and uniquely Los Dos!"}
{"text":"While in ahwatukee last night for a music festival, we decided to go try Los Dos as it came recommended and was very close by.   We were greeted right away and were given a half moon booth to squeeze into.  A gal came and took our drink order and our soft drinks came out right away. A house margarita took 15 minutes. Yikes. To say that the service was slow would be an extreme understatement.  After finally getting our margarita, our real server took our food order. I got stacked enchiladas, wifey and daughter each ordered a green corn tamale. Also, a ala carte taco and beef flautas. I asked for a side of honey as I had to cool my mouth from the ridiculously hot green salsa.  Here's where it gets bad, real bad.  The honey comes in this little black ramekin, color is key here. I dipped a few chips in the honey and had succeeded to cool my mouth off, when i saw a small black ant type bug crawling on my hand. I simply squashed it and was about to dip another chip when i saw several dozen ants doing laps around the ramekin.  After killing as many as I could find, I called the server over and told her what was up. She was incredulous that there were any bugs and took the bowl away. Oh, our food was still MIA after 25 minutes. During that time a manager type came by with the server in tow, and asked the server while standing at our table, \"Is this the bug guy?\" She proceeded to explain that she had personally prepared the honey bowls only an hour prior and that she couldnt believe that there were bugs in the bowls. Thankfully the server had looked into the ramekin when she had taken it back to kitchen and found more and told the manager that there were indeed bugs.  The manager made no offer to comp or toss in a dessert or app, i guess cause our food was still mia. Ok, i guess we should have left, but we were starving and our food finally came:  My stacked enchiladas was very average, the best thing in the plate was the rice.  The tortillas were so tough, i had to use a knife to cut them. The two green con tamales, well.... i could only tell that it was a tamale because it was served on a corn husk. The cook had chopped it up into some unrecognizable mush that was bland whose only taste came from the overdose of hot peppers. The beef taco was reported to be ok, but again it was so spicy that it took away from the taste. The best food item was the flauta, no one can screw up a deep fried rolled up corn tortilla right?? To sum up, over priced, bug infested, super spicy to cover up the lack of taste, very long delays and rude manager. Never to return. I will try and keep as many of my friends from going as well."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and dinner this evening. Nice happy hour with $4 margaritas   and $5 mexican pizzas (recommended). There were just a few other people here this early, so the kitchen staff was super fast. As others have stated, most of the food is spicy hot but the green chili is less hot than the red, and there are items on their menu which  are not hot. Their guacamole is delicious, with a unique garlicky note. If your mouth gets hot from the spices, then order a Sombrero drink ( two shots milk, one shot coffee liqueur) to cool it off. Another option is to order their outstanding sopapillas with honey, which will also sooth your mouth.    The chicken chimichanga was a generous size and very good. The green corn tamale was a little small and just average flavor.    It is nice to sit out on their colorful patio which feels secluded and has lively music playing. We will certainly return to this delicious restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst excuse for mexican food, ever.  Who messes up tacos??? Tacos were full of fatty meat and the avocado was brown. Yuck. Absolutely terrible service to boot. I'll never come here again"}
{"text":"Love spicy Mexican food? Well then this is the place for you. They have great food, great service and great beers to choose from. My family and I go here often."}
{"text":"The service here is always horrible; the staff moves incredibly slow.  Four of us came in for lunch at about 1pm on a Saturday and left well after 2:30 pm.  It took 45 minutes for our food to arrive and then another half an hour to flag someone to receive our check, then wait 15 minutes further to get change and the receipt.  They also charge a dollar each time we had our chip bowl refilled (which we were not aware of until the bill arrived) and they also charge 0.75 for refills on iced tea and soda (which I was aware of b/c it was clearly stated in the menu.)  You should ask when you order a specific beer whether they offer it on tap, because they will not ask you on their own which you prefer, and automatically bring out a bottle which is more expensive.  The food has flavor, and their salsa is spicy.  They make homemade tortillas but unfortunately mine was burnt and dried out.  Their margaritas are delicious and the decor festive.  I don't think the prices are worth the wait or the portion sizes though."}
{"text":"I went to this location one other time and have went to the Ahwatukee and Mesa location. Which I love. Well last night I went here. I waited a hour for a table. Which I am fine with. But the service was terrible. The people next to us stopped the mgr and asked could he take their order. He did but when we asked the same thing he said he would be right back. No one came for 30 minutes. So now we were there for almost 2 hours with nothing ordered. Once we did order they served me the Shrimp Veracruz with store bough tortillas. I asked what happened to the homemade. I was then brought homemade but told for my particular meal THE OWNER said to serve store bought. Really? My dish is the most expensive item on the menu. So why skimp. The food was good but the service was terrible. Also my friend never got his taco. Our server acted as if we were an inconvenience. No worries because I will NEVER GO BACK there."}
{"text":"Los Dos is absolutely other - worldly!  There are no flavours like this that I have found in Canada. Of course, this is not surprising. This quaint establishment offers a straightforward menu with amazing tastes. Faves  include Cheese Crisp - be sure to ask for sliced jalapeño and  Adavada Ribs,    Be aware that Los Dos brings the heat and it is fabulous! You will need at least tres cerveza with your meal!  Service is always polite and accommodating. Meals arrive promptly.   I like how Los Dos honours the US Military - very cool!   I highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The carnitas plate is incredible... Salsas are tasty and fresh. Great for lazy Sunday brunch.. Will go again for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after a handful of coworkers recommended it.  In a sea of Mexican options this one was on point!  I had the carnitas plate.  The portion was large, and the flavor was amazing.  Rice and beans that came on the plate were good accompaniments, and the chips and salsa was good, and spicy!    The owner, Brent, seems like a good guy who runs a tight ship.  They are moving locations soon so, check before you head over.  Last thing you want to do is get there and find they have already switched to the new spot."}
{"text":"The service here was absolutely horrendous. The food is great but we weren't tended to for 30 minutes. They claimed they were busy but there were 5 other tables. I cannot emphasize how ridiculous me and my guest were treated. There other location was fantastic and had a cute busser named Brandon. Ever since I've wanted to go back, there new location is sub par."}
{"text":"Heard so many positive reviews and word of mouth.  So I was excited to try this place, especially with all the hype that they use all the New Mexico related marketing.  My instinct should have kept me away.  The way any respectible New Mexican knows you splell Chile (with an E at the end), this should have been the first sign at how bad it was going to be.  Anybody that is used to real New Mexican fare, don't go here!  The food is absolutely atrocious.  I feel so ripped off that I had to overpay for this garbage, yes overpay, it way overpriced and the drinks are watered down.  I really feel for the people that have not had the chance to eat real quality food and they think this place is special.  Wow!  Stay away!"}
{"text":"Well the chips and salsa were good while it lasted now been waiting 15 minutes for refills on our sodas and chips. I had to get up and find our server just to get those and he seemed upset that I even asked. Waiting on our food order to come which was taken about 20 more minutes. Oh did I mention we waited for a table for 25 minutes when they said 10 then we get shoved in the corner with a loud family blehh"}
{"text":"These guys and gals are one of the few highlights of the South Phoenix area. Though this is clearly not health food, they don't claim it to be. Regardless, they have DELICIOUS Mexican food - though it does get quite spicy at times.  Everyone that works here is so nice and polite - they're always a genuine charm to talk to!  The only negative thing I can think of is the interior of the restaurant - it's a bit kitschy and cramped. However, I think this is part of the charm of the place, so take that however you want.  Overall, I couldn't recommend a better place for some hearty, flavorful Mexican food."}
{"text":"food was great!  I came for 'spicy' and that's exactly what I got.    server was cold and not personable.   took my order and never came back around to check on me.  during the two brief interactions with her (ordering and paying) I couldn't even get a simple fake smile from her.    It costs nothing to smile and be friendly to make people feel welcome.  It cost her a couple extra bucks in tip money for her lack of, however."}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times in the past year, and this place has not disappointed. Probably the best place for mexican food in the Phoenix/Chandler/Scottsdale area. Love the Guacamole, and the salsa has a real kick to it. Huge margarita glass!"}
{"text":"Oy, where to begin? I struggled with how to rate this location and I echo the sentiments of fellow Yelpers: it truly does not possess the same fabulosity as the downtown location. The Pros: I called for a takeout order (beef burro, x-mas style - red & green chile) and it was ready as soon as I walked in. The Cons: I got home to find that I did not in fact get a beef burro x-mas style, but rather a beef chimichanga with green chile only. Chimichangs are, historically speaking, not my bag and since it's served enchilada style, I didn't realize it was fried until I tucked into it. I noticed the lack of red chile but decided to try anyway. After realizing I'd gotten the wrong order, I called the restaurant and spoke to the gentleman who packed up my burro. He insisted that he had given me the correct order and said I could \"bring it back for (him) to look at\" and for a moment, I thought, perhaps the error was mine. I hung up the phone and more carefully inspected my lunch: yep, definitely a chimi with green chile. I called back to speak to him and explained that there was a beef chimi with green chile sitting in front of me and he seemed surprised and offered to exchange it right away. I told him I was not able to return that day and he promised a free burro upon my next visit.   I have not yet returned and I don't know if I will come back to this location. The food is really very good but the service seemed super-rushed and when I took umbrage with my order, I was initially met with an incredulous response.  I do hope they can get it together because it would be great to have a reliable Los Dos location in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"When compared to the central location the food is sub-standard as well as the service"}
{"text":"Anyplace that serves green chili deserves at least a 2, probably 3.  As a New Mexican i went in with high hopes, but they faded when the salsa came out.  Tomatillo based green sauce instead of Green Chili?  really?    it was spicy and had a good kick, but when I hear New Mexican, i want the real stuff.    I ordered the relleno and it was the first place i've ever had one that wasn't fried.  It was just the stuffed chilli wrapped in an omlette style egg.  ok, that was a new one. Not bad, but i'll take the crispy fried one.  The overall taste of food was good and i would go back again just because they serve green chile.  But overall, not very impressive.    Ever since the Albuquerque Tortilla Factory and Hatch Valley Chile Company went under, it's been a struggle to find good New Mexican food in AZ."}
{"text":"I'd like to start this review with a giant F!@k You to the clowns operating this restaurant now. I've been coming to this place for the better part of 20 years. When I come to Phoenix, I make sure to stop in Los Dos Molinos. Never again. I may not be hispanic dude, but I'm 43 years old and I grew up and have lived within a few miles of the border ALL MY LIFE. I know what an enchilada is MF'er. I've traveled the world. I've eaten some of the scariest food in the darkest corners of this beautiful world and I have never in my life had such terrible food. Eastern Europe, Central America, South America, could never have invented the vial slop that these knuckleheads are parading as food. Everyone who ate the food this evening are doubled over the toilet RIGHT NOW MF'ers. We drove an hour to eat this shit. Guess what was difficult not doing after eating your food? You got it, VOMITING!!! So once again, F@&k you Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.   The queso dip is phenomenal to start with.   All of the food is amazing that I have tried. It is very spicy though on certain items so be careful if you aren't a fan of spice.   The staff is probably my favorite part of this place. They are all super happy, and happy to have you in their restaurant. They genuinely want you to have the best possible experience you can.   We've been coming here on Sunday mornings and it's a great place to kick off a nice lazy Sunday. Stuff your face, drink a margarita, then go home and relax and watch some football."}
{"text":"Overpriced and over-spiced. Ha...seriously though, just because you make the food spicy doesn't mean it is any good.  Anyone can add chilies upon chilies and peppers to any food.  I enjoy spicy food, but the food has to at least be good first.    Typical mexican food with chilies and heat added to a point of if anything did have flavor it is now hidden.  The interior is a mixture of someones southwestern nightmare and cheap utensils."}
{"text":"Do you like freshly prepped food mixed with authenticity? If you answered yes, then you're sure to love Cheryl and Ricks' approach. Everything this great couple cooks up is done exactly like that, and who knows, you may even run into a new dish. While she has a menu you may very well fall in love with a one of a kind treat she's conjured up for you. Is it hot? Yep, but that's the way it should be right? If you don't enjoy the spicier side of the dish just ask, and she'll make sure you leave with a great taste in your mouth.  Regards,  Mike W. A.K.A Magic Mike Hotel Concierge"}
{"text":"We were referred to Los Dos Molinos by our Uber driver. Although we've been exploring the Valley for 10'years, we have been looking for a \"go to\" Mexican restaurant. Grabbed a table in the adorable patio on a comfortable night. All staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Margarita was excellent, with the house Margarita very large and delicious. The chips kept coming (one helping of chips was somewhat stale; hence minus one star), with the salsas to die for, and a little bit of heat. We ordered the Adovada Enchilada dinner, green sauce, complete with fried egg on top & a chimichanga. Food was excellent, with the flavors just jumping out, New Mexico style. The rice and beans were very flavorful.   We capped off the meal with the apple sopapilla and vanilla ice cream. Sopapilla was hot, light and tasty and perfect with the sautéed bananas and ice cream. Overall we had an excellent meal and a new, fun place to go when craving Mexican! Prices were very reasonable, with our bill $53 including 2 meals, 2 drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here for years and before that I ate at the one in Springerville. The food is pretty good but after this weekend I won't be coming back. My kid brother wanted to go here for his birthday with the folks and our kids So 5 adults, and 4 kids. We left out at 4:30 fully anticipating weekend crowds.  They had us wait for 20 Min's then took us back to a table that may seat 4 then when it was obvious we could not seat here the host dipped out Thats right he was gone just left us standing there,  I know \"family owned\" allows for some easement on formalities however that crosses over the line. How about not waste our time? A simple we just can't accommodate you at this time would suffice The host does not have the most. Just simply due to chitty attitude I can spend my dinero somewhere else where they appreciate patronage"}
{"text":"Went hear on cinco de mayo. Found no drink specials, and The bartender couldn't remember what the food specials were even though the manager was trying to remind him to tell me about the food specials. I Decided to order just a taco to try it out and it was pretty good but at $6.45 for one  taco a little disappointed. I had ordered a margarita and a shot of Hornitos. Like someone had mentioned before they bring you a tablet and wait for you to finish signing and I was a little shocked when my grand total was $34.12 besides the high prices the wait staff seemed incredibly green which surprised me since it has been a well-established restaurant and it was Cinco de Mayo."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good service and the green sauce has a nice heat to it."}
{"text":"They serve vegetarian Mexican food here. The food is also served spicy. Chips and salsa are very spicy with lot of flavor. The best Mexican restaurant period."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said already? It's VERY hot food. They do have options that aren't as hot, but they don't sound as good. I have finally found a dish that I can eat which is the bean burro. That might sound funny but it's perfectly seasoned whole beans (just like my Suegra used to make).  The tortilla is soft, fresh, warm. It is a perfect specimen of a bean burro.   I might mention, I'm happy I found something I can eat there, because I do love their Coronarita to drink. It really should be called \"the tranquilizer\"."}
{"text":"Bad service! Very spicy! We had s party of 8 and the night started great with the waiter answering our questions, accommodating our party etc. however when all the food came out, three of the 8 dishes was wrong, and one had to be sent back just because it was terrible. Also, if you cannot handle spicy food, this is not your spot. There are no mild options. Even the chips and salsa in the beginning are scorching with no mild option."}
{"text":"Had the taco salad. Bleh. Staff was not the most welcoming. Hate it when someone says \" what can I get for you boss?!\""}
{"text":"Where to start?  My husband and I LOVE this place.  The food is consistently amazing.  They make everything to order, so while it's not lightning fast food service, their margaritas and ambiance make the wait something to look forward to.  You can get food ranging from incredibly mild to wildly spicy.  Everything we've had is delicious.  Whenever we are there, the staff always works as a team.  While you have a dedicated server for your meal, you will also likely encounter many more staff as they take your drink order, fill your water, stop and chat etc.  Everyone there clearly loves what they do, and it shows in the quality of their service and of their food.  You won't be disappointed, give them a try!"}
{"text":"NEW MEXICAN FOOD not MEXICAN.  that is what i think alot of the neg reviews come from.   I have been to the South Phx location and this location is only a few miles from my home.  i dont really understand some peoples judgements....just because its in a strip mall doesnt make it a bad place.  if your from the south or the midwest and used to free standing places get over that. you will miss out on some of the best dining in the valley.  not just this place.  we went on saturday 6/2 at about 545pm an early dinner for us.  like 99% of downtown eateries it was not crowded at all. probably about 12 people in the place. the margaritas were great.  more importantly the food was great NEW mexican food. HOT HOT HOT.  if you dont like spicy dont come here. its not for you.  if you like to have your eyes water this is the place.   ive been here a few times and im not really sure what the complaints are about the service.  they have always been very nice and very FAST service. first we ordered our massive margaritas which also came out surprisling fast.  we ordered our dinners and within 10min the food was in front of us.  i think the longest we have ever waited was maybe 20min.    to people reading the reviews...spicy is HOT.  There is nothing at the chain type places that compare to the heat you get with these dinners.  the green chili salsa is probably the best in the valley.  the red is right up there too.    usually when i do go i order one of the specials or something the waiter recommends i have yet to be let down."}
{"text":"It's the best NEW MEXICAN food in the world at this moment in time.  I travel for work regularly to Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Taos, Pajuaque, Las Vegas NM, and all the other Meccas and I grew up in Grants.  Right now, at this location they are killing it for authentic!  It's not for everyone granted its really not for kids, families, or gringo girls and chicken tacos, it's for red chile sauceophiles and pork.  I have taken dozens of NM relatives and they agree to a person it's the best they've had in years!  I'd probably die without it."}
{"text":"WHOOO-EEEY!!! This was some SPICY food, without sacrificing the flavor.  The salsa, both red and green, had a great kick to it.  I ordered the enchiladas dinner, which comes with a fried egg on top!  It was delicious, and so spicy that I was crying!  Thank heaven they leave a pitcher of water on the table!  Can't wait to try something new next time.  Bring it on!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there because I had a restaurants.com coupon. The food was way too hot and the service was the worst. It took me 4 tries to get a receipt to leave, 3 tries to get a to go box, our drinks were never refilled and we had 3 different people helping us that were all inattentive and really didn't seem to care. I will never go back here, thumbs totally down."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Not worth all the hype. Order took a while. Food was eh. Even if I lived around here, I prob wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"Went to Los Dos Molinos for the first and last time today. Ordered the Adovada Ribs. Chunks of very fatty pork were presented, not ribs. The rice was bland, the tortilla became hard as soon as it cooled. The best thing about the meal was the iced tea."}
{"text":"Wow was this food good! I just went here for the first time and I was surprised by how good the food was since I haven't found a good mexican restaurant since moving to Phoenix. The food here was incredible- I ordered the Green Chile Plate and the beef was melt in your mouth delicious as was the tortilla. The salsas that were served were delicious as well, and I preferred the green one! Nothing was too spicy but it had a good amount of spice. I will undoubtedly be coming back here when I crave mexican food."}
{"text":"The food is really good, very spicy, but lots of flavor in both green and red chile, although the rice & beans are just mediocre. I would have given more stars if the margaritas were better. At this location I noticed the margs are premixed and taste artificial. The overall experience would be 4 or 5 in my eyes if the margs were good."}
{"text":"Depressing atmosphere and horrible service. The \"manager\" is RUDE. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place used to be great, but now the food is average. Based on the quality and amount served, the menu is overpriced. Also, they don't allow substitutes and they don't split checks."}
{"text":"We heard a lot about this place from a friend who swears by it so we went there last weekend.  The place is a stand alone building but that did not deter us. Got seated right away, placed our order,  the food was at the table in less than 10 min's.  Oh the salsa for the chips, hot and hotter.  I had the chili relleano which was prepared correctly, meaning the skin was pealed from the pepper, but that's all i can say about it.  Rice was dry and crunchy, beans tasted stale.  My wife had the carnitias which were tender but had little taste and nothing to rave about.  The real fun started that night, i had such a bad case of heartburn and diarrhea that i could not sleep, and going #2 was brutally painful. The wife was  also sick, vomiting ,shaking and still, almost 3 days later has no appetite at all. Don't think we'll be going back for a repeat performance."}
{"text":"Ok so I had high expectations when we found this place. We had heard great things about the margaritas and those were nearly accurate. My girlfriend had the house blended lime margarita and loved it. This restaurant definitely caters to the Arizonians who are looking for americanized Mexican food. I ordered a chicken Burro which came with the red and green enchilada sauce. I love spicy food so this was very disappointing. The worst part of the whole experience was that the menu said to \"be patient\" while waiting for the food to come out, and we should have known then. It took FOR EVER to get our food, had to beg our bro'd out waiter for more chips and never had our waters refilled. It was definitely not worth the high prices and we won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Los Dos.  Between the positive reviews, and word of mouth, we dismissed the negative yelp reviews as happenstance. We shouldn't have. First, it took forever to get menus, well after we got our drinks.  The 'House' margaritas are horrid - like tequila and Crystal Light! @ $21.00 a pitcher, WAY too much. Then, the food. My companion's chimi was tasteless.  Mine was 'okay', but nothing to write home about. The salsa was very spicy, as advertised, and if the entrees and drinks had been better I'd probably return for that.  My companion said not on a bet! The only positive comment my companion had was the beer she subbed for the poor margs was cold! The waitress/bartender did not charge us for the margarita pitcher,(because of our complaints!) but took forever to return to collect our payment! I ate half my meal, and my partner left hungry! All-in-all a negative experience."}
{"text":"Everything I have ever had here is delicious. Margaritas will bite you and so can the food.  Number 6 is awesome.   The staff is the best. Great people great times.  Some like it hot!"}
{"text":"Great food. I had the pork roast burro and it was outstanding. Best service in town. Food it relatively hot but not overbearing."}
{"text":"Good food. Large portions. Right price. What more can I say? Lunch was a success and I will be going back!"}
{"text":"After living in Albuquerque for 6 years, I know good chile when I taste it. Los Dos Molinos serves up a damn good green chile. Unfortunately, the food over which the green chile is ladled isn't quite as spectacular. I tried the blue corn enchiladas and, while they were descent, they weren't special.  What's more, I was disappointed that the meal ended without a basket of sopapillas on the table. If you're trying to pull off authentic New Mexican cuisine, you had better deliver some sopas with the main course. Sure, I could have spent an extra $6 on their weird sopapilla desserts, but I'm no sucker.   If I go back with different (not lower) expectations, Los Dos might get a 4-star rating. The green chile salsa was tasty. Also, I suspect their adovada ribs are worth a try."}
{"text":"Very yummy! Every time we go ive had good food. Salsa is hot.  Sometimes it gets too busy and they forget about you, that's why 4 stars."}
{"text":"So happy Los Dos Molinos is in the east valley!  Los Dos makes it spicy so come prepared to drink a lot of margaritas...not like that's a bad thing.  Great food & great prices!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been in awhile, but just as I remembered it. Had the red chillie combo, ladies each had the garlic shrimp. Friend had chili releno. Everyone loved their meal and the pitchers of \"kick ass margaritas\" were the best we've had in a long time - nice and home made tasting, not the excessive sour mix found all to often at other places.  Friendly Service was very good to boot.   Bravo Molinos.!!!!"}
{"text":"Kept trying this place over and over expecting it to get better.  It never did.  How can food be made to order when it arrives at your table in 2 minutes.  The waiters couldn't wait to get us out of there.  It's now off our list."}
{"text":"Food was terrible!!! The carnitas were very very dry. The shrimp in garlic sauce was a disaster no flavor once so ever!!! We will never come back again!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband... He had told me that this place was getting great reviews and all, that the food was great as well as service, so I took his word for it. Well, truthfully. He was wrong, we had terrible service and the food was not that good as well. We first walked in and it wasn't that busy. A guy asked us if we were gonna take a table for two, we told him we wanted to look at the menu to see what we would order to go. He said okay. We looked over the menu, and we were ready to order so I went up to the front desk to tell him we were ready, adjust when we were gonna tell him, he completely ignored me as a group of four people walked in and attended to them first, that pissed us both off. After he sat them he took my order. Then as we were about to pay this lady comes back and pretty much shoves the check of our order in front of me in very ill mannered way and tells is angrily our total. The only reason I'm actually giving this place two stars and not one is because of the manager. He was very nice and was asking not just us but everyone in the restaurant if everything was good or if we needed anything at all. Other than that, the service was horrible. The food was half good and half not too good. Truthfully I rather go down the street to a \"filibertos\" type of place than come here again."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food, fun setting.  Carnitos: lean, slow cooked tender. This meal was one of the few where you add your own heat, to taste. hand made flour tortilla. Yum.  Flautas: wife and son-in-law's mom got these ( chicken, beef). Tasty, tender meat. Sour cream and guacamole took off some of the heat from the green (v. Hot) salsa  Daily special enchiladas: spicy with an egg on top, which may sound odd to some, but it really worked on this dish  Son-in-law got the burro. Distance runner (as in ultra marathon), who is a bottomless pit, and had leftovers to take home.   We had both regular and K.A. Margaritas (as in  Kick Ass). Go with the KA!  We'll be back on future visits."}
{"text":"Great place for New Mexican Food!!!! Our  favorite. Staff is the best. Great manager. Tells great jokes. Love that they have a gluten free menu."}
{"text":"This was a major hot spot for my coworkers and myself at one of past jobs. It's not fancy but wow the food is delicious!  This is one of those places where service can be a bit cold but if you're looking for create food and don't care about making a connection with your waiter and waitress's...give it a try!"}
{"text":"Bottom Line: The food was not the best, the service was non-existant.  Los Dos was recommended to me by multiple friends, so of course, I had to give it a try.  We ordered the green chile with pork that was on special as well as the chimi.  Neither of these items were anything special.  The pork was quite fatty and did not appeal to me for this reason primarily, but in addition, the rice and beans lacked a distinct flavor putting them at the bottom of their categories.  The chimi was better, but the meat didn't have the expected strong flavor.  The salsa was actually pretty good, but the chips were stale and thick which really hampers a good salsa experience!  Finally, the service was terrible.  First, no one at the door.  Finally, we found someone at ended up being told to seat ourselves.  Then, no server ever came for drinks or food until someone came and asked us if we still needed to be helped.  The proceeded to go and find the right person, give up 5 minutes later and then came back to take our order.  Then we waited another 5 minutes for drinks and salsa.  Never received a refill on either of them.  To top it off, then we never got a bill.  I actually got up to look for someone and finally found someone to help get us checked out."}
{"text":"Great salsa with some real heat, strong margaritas and the flautas were great.  We also ate at the New York City location before they closed it.  Will definitely go back if I'm ever in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Cant stress enough how much I love this place, great food, great staff, and I like it HOT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great enchiladas. Just spicy enough. I wasn't a fan of the margaritas though."}
{"text":"Food is good, still their service lacks, took an hour to get food, no apology, no explanation and there was maybe 4 other tables of people"}
{"text":"I was referred to this place by a shuttle bus driver while traveling to Arizona. This place specializes in New Mexican style food. I was warned the food is very hot and spicy and it was but not unbearable. I tried their signature dish adovada ribs based on a recommendation from our driver. When they came out I was surprised their was no bone and then u realized they are country style ribs so they don't come on the bone. This made it easier to eat. The meat was very tender. The sauce was spicy but flavorful. It came with a fresh hot tortilla.   The place is pretty popular and the inside was packed when we arrived. We didn't want to wait a long time for seating so we opted for outdoor seating. It was cold that night so they put us near s flamed heater however the fire burned out and they could not relight it so that was a let down. The servers were nice. Overall a decent experience."}
{"text":"Our first visit and we were very impressed.  Service was excellent, margaritas were delish, and the food yummy!  We love hotter salsa and they didn't disappoint! You usually have to ask for stuff this hot at other places.  It's quite a drive for us but if we're in the area, we will stop by again."}
{"text":"Old School Arizona Mexican place with lots of quirky nooks and crannies. Great place to take out of town guests to show them something uniquely AZ and watch them sweat as they suffer through their spicy carne adovada that's so delicious they can't stop eating it. Large menu with all the familiar family Mexican classics, reasonable prices, a variety of combos for those that can't choose.  Lots of patio seating too but it's mostly in the sun. Margaritas available by the glass or by the pitcher, delicious."}
{"text":"This place is great! New Mexico style Mexican food, spicy, and flavorful! I would highly recommend Los Dos Molinos to anyone who loves spicy Mexican food, though I've been told their milder dishes are excellent as well."}
{"text":"This was a total dissapointment.....met with friend for dinner tonight at the Mesa location. First visit to Los dos for all 5 of us.  The host seated us and I'm not really sure it's a good position for him to be in. Odd sense of humor  and pretty off-putting.  Tried the salsa- very spicy, and read the menu to discover EVERYTHING except the flautas and may 1 o4 2 more items were NOT spicy. Decided most of our group didn't like their food that hot, so we decided we'd pay for our 2 margaritas and appetizers (2 orders of jalapeno poppers @4.50 each0 and our bill was $36. Seemed pretty pricy to me for what we got, although the attitude from the host/waiter was free and worth less, that was when he realized we weren't eating dinner there. Very unprofessional.  SO we headed up the road to Macayo's and had great service, delicious food  and a great atmosphere. BTW my dinner and beverage at Macayo's came to just under $20 dollars including tip!  Now that's what I call value!"}
{"text":"New Mexico style, and the food is fairly hot (like it's supposed to be). Everything from the chips and salsa to the margaritas is great. The carne adovada enchilada (which comes with a fried egg) is unbelievably good. Order it Christmas style so you get the red and green chile sauces (green is hotter in NM)."}
{"text":"I didn't see what the hype was about with this place.  Food was ok.  Service wasn't the best.  The waiter was upset we asked for separate checks... Not very friendly and he could not add everything properly.  This place is ok but not the best."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever experienced - unfortunate because the food was really good. After the waiter took our order, we never saw him again. Never came over to ask if we needed refills (which is necessary since the food is spicy) and didn't get everything we ordered. Pointed it out to the waiter, but still never got our guacamole and they still tried to charge me for it. Also, my wife had to carry her plate to the cashier just to get her leftovers boxed since the waiter just dropped the check off as he ran by.  If the service was even decent, I would be a frequent customer, but because the service was so bad, I won't go back again."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Los Dos...this is my new favorite mexican restaurant!  We go to the Mesa location and the service is excellent!  The posole wtih red sauce is my favorite on a Sunday morning, and my boyfried always gets the Adovada Ribs!  It is hot, flavorful and leaves you craving more each time!  Love, love, love it!"}
{"text":"I was trying to go for a birthday dinner and saw online that they closed at 9:30. Called the restaurant to be sure and to let them know a large group would be in and was told they close at 7:30, which was okay. A group of 10 of us showed up at 5:00 to find a sign on the door, in pen, saying \"sorry we closed at 4:30!!!\" (This was 20 minutes after we called). Incredibly unprofessional. Will not recommend this place nor will I go to this location again."}
{"text":"Ugh... what a disappointment!   Atmosphere was a little blah in my opinion.... had a cheap feel to it.   No lunch menu so we were force to pay dinner prices $34 including tip. Chips were okay, but both the green and red salsas were awful!  I don't even know how to explain the flavor... no bueno! I ordered the Chile Relleno and my girl ordered the enchilada/taco combo.  We weren't impressed with either dish.  Mediocre at best. Everything seemed a bit over seasoned (and maybe just not seasoned well)...   Really unfortunate because we were hoping for a good Mexican restaurant close to home :("}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Finally got a beer several people trying to get server attention. Didn't happen. Walked out. Insane"}
{"text":"Wow, great food and service.  The cheese crisp was great, with the green chile for flavor and a bit of spice.  Our dishes were very flavorful, spicy, and presented well.  Neighborhood joint with lots of character and fun.  Will definitely go back for authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"We've lived here for 10 years and I've been training myself to eat hotter food over that time. The first time we went to Los Dos was almost 20 years ago and I could hardly eat the food, it was so hot. Now I just salivate when I think of it.  I used to eat the Garlic Shrimp which is tasty but not hot. I've graduated. I love the Garlic Roast Pork and the Green Chile Stew. Unlike the other entrees which normally come with rice, beans and a tortilla, the Green Chile Stew comes with rice, beans, sour cream and 4 sopapillas. Yum! It was so good! We had the Garlic Pork and Green Chile Stew last Sunday... and my hubby drove in from Gold Canyon to bring the same plates home tonight. I'm set for a few weeks now.   I'm not crazy about their salsas, personal preference.  Their chips are nice and hefty.  This is a NEW MEXICAN restaurant, not Mexican. You can compare the two things, but they're not the same.   It gives the initial appearance of being a dark & dirty dive, but it's not. It's clean. I don't have to check my seat or table before I sit. Parking can be a problem but who cares? The food is worth it.  Service sometimes lapses... see above.  I wish it was in my backyard instead of @25 miles away."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town. And spicy! The service is always great. Can't say enough about how much I love this place."}
{"text":"Did you change owners or managers? We used to love this place and visited every time that we were in Phoenix. Well known for the very HOT and delicious food, we were very disappointed on our recent visit. The food was not spicy at all, so much for those who like it hot, which is their logo!! One of our guests was even served a large portion of FAT (more than half of the meat in the meal) in their carnitas, you would have thought that the cooks would have seen this and not served it!! Will not be coming back next time."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!! Myself & co-worker had the most horrible experience at this restaurant! We decided to try Los Dos Molinos for lunch since we were craving Mexican food & it was close by our work. Since neither of us had ever eaten here before we asked our waiter about the menu & lunch specials. He had no idea what he was talking about. So he asked the bus boy about the specials. We were very confused. After several minutes of looking over the extremely over priced menu, we made our decisions. This time a different waiter came to take our orders. We specifically asked him if the food was spicy & he assured us it wasn't. Once the food arrived & we took our first bites, both of our mouths were on fire! There was no way for us to even attempt to eat the food. We immediately let the first waiter we spoke to know that we couldn't eat the food & we were just going to leave because we were not satisfied with the orders & we had to get back to work as we were on our lunch hour. He apologized & went to talk to the manager. They spoke behind the kitchen curtain just a few feet from our table. We could overhear their conversation. The manager asked that waiter to go get the waiter who took our order. After about 5 minutes of them debating & arguing behind the curtain the waiter who took our order came over to us & said, \"I just talked to my manager. I'll pay for your plate (he pointed at my food), but she'll have to pay for hers.\" I couldn't believe what I just heard!!! I replied, \"No. We're not paying for ANY of this! We specifically asked YOU if the food was spicy. You said no. We both took one bite of our food & it's like fire in our mouths. We're not paying for food that isn't edible to us & is barely touched! We have to get back to work so we're leaving now.\" My co-worker paid for the drinks because she's overly kind. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. We wanted Mexican food, but that doesn't mean we wanted to have our taste buds burned from our tongues. This place was by far the worst experience I've ever had. Starting from the waiters who clearly knew nothing about the food they served, the overpriced menu, the unprofessional manager who didn't bother to deal with the situation herself & instead chose to hide behind a curtain & ultimately the poor customer service the waiter who took our order gave us!"}
{"text":"Beautifully spicy. This is a legit 4.5. The main dishes are 5s. The rice and beans are very good but wished there were more side elements and grilled flavors. Tequila offerings are great. Beer menu is a bit limited."}
{"text":"Went for stuff sopapilla with a friend, very disappointed. I received  two (2) small pieces of bread with a tablespoon of shredded chicken laying in liquid (soggy). My daughter's favorite food is Mexican, however she did not eat the stuff sopapilla. The kicker is I paid $13.99 or $12.99. OVERPRICE. Unfortunately I will not be recommending this location."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Be warned that the food here is spicy, but if you enjoy spicy food, I highly recommend this place.  I have had several of the menu items from the adovada ribs to burritos and enchiladas.  I've enjoyed them all and the margaritas are the perfect compliment to the meal."}
{"text":"It is great to have Los Dos in Ahwatukee!   What a great addition to the community.    The food it great.  The people are friendly.  I would love to give them 5 stars, but they'll need to quickly get the folks trained and they need to finish working out the start-up issues."}
{"text":"I think that this is probably one of the more authentic Mexican food restaurants that I have been to and if you really want to add extra kick to your meal, try a prickly pear margarita.  Boy - those things will definitely add some intrigue to your night or at the very least some good laughs.   If you go, plan extra time to sit and wait for a table because chances are unless you are very lucky, you will have to wait quite awhile to be seated.  But, I think that it is worth the wait.  Amendment, May 2008 - I have co-workers in town for a trade show.   A few nights ago, I suggested Los Dos for dinner.  I warned them that the service was slow but the food is always good.  We agreed to try it.  We arrived at 7:15ish.  Half of our party wasn't there - so in order to not be rude and take up a table, we ordered some drinks, chips & guacamole and took a table outside to wait.  At around 8, we were still minus 2 guests and starving.  So, I went in and got us a table.  I'd say our other 2 finally showed up around 8:30.  We did not get greeted by a waiter until 9pm - an hour after sitting.  Had he come up to us in the beginning, I would have told him that we were going to just order as a partial party.  But no one even asked.  They sent over a nice guy that could only take our drinks and kept saying that he'd bring us a waiter.  Right before the waiter finally appeared, I walked up the hostess stand and let them know that it really had been far too long to be waiting.  There were 2 girls behind the stand and a busboy (not really sure what his position was considering most of the night he ogled these 2 girls and stood scratching his head at the hostess stand - maybe he was the third hostess?).  They were pretty rude to me and continued to get ruder through out the night.  Unfortunately, I had such a BAD experience that I will no longer be recommending this place to anyone.  I'm rating it a one star - down from 4 stars.  I was embarrassed that my co-workers had to see such a nasty side of my fellow Arizonans.  I will not be returning to Los Dos Molinos.  I have had a lot of poor service here - but I always took the bad with the good because the food is good.  But, they just crossed the line too far this time and I won't support a place that treats me (the customer) badly.  I work in the service industry from time to time at trade shows.  I know that people have their bad days and I know that it can be hard to always meet every customers needs - but I also know that I do my very best to be kind and helpful to every customer no matter what mood I am in and I expect the same in return if I am spending money for a service."}
{"text":"Great New Mexican food. Good service.  The carne adovada was awesome.  I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Wow - great food.  The carne asada, and the garlic pork roast with potatoes are amazing.  They also made us some empanadas that were to die for.  It was spicy and delicious."}
{"text":"This is by far the best location out of them all. Great service, Food and margaritas. I live in surprise but I always make a trip for the best food in town."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. With just a party of 2 or an actually party of 15. I have never had a problem with the service. The food is always excellent as well as the margaritas! The salsa is amazing it is very spicy but has great flavor!"}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed at the service. Hours of operation state close at 11pm, walked in at 10:03pm and the hostess makes a face and says \"the kitchen is closed\". What kind of service is that?! Pathetic excuse for a restaurant."}
{"text":"When it's hot it's hot. This place is my all time favorite Mexican restaurant!  I have never had a bad meal here. I absolutely will continue going back for the adovada (ribs or burrito) and the \"kick-ass margaritas.    Expect a very fiesta type atmosphere.The manager(or maybe he is the owner) is a great guy with a good sense of humor and friendly. This place is WELL WORTH THE TRIP,especially if you like hot food!  DON'T do like I did. The first several times I went here I ordered the same thing because it was so good. Since then I have tried many different meals and haven't been dissapointed yet!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, I enjoyed every bite of it. However....not sure if she was the manager but not only did she blatantly talk down to her coworkers in front of everyone but she was super rude to us when she came to our table and when we paid for the food. The food is the only thing that would keep me coming back. I just pray that she won't be there the next time. Horrible service."}
{"text":"We went to Los Dos Molinos in Awhatukee Thursday evening.   First they brought us Chips and Salsa that was the hottest I have ever tasted and I asked for mild to mediuim salsa and there is a $2 charge for mild to medium salsa?   We asked for water, it was 103° degrees out and the water was warm with no ice:?  The menu was far more expensive than other Mexican resturants.  The Burito was large but was so salty we couldn't eat it.   The Street tacos were the smallest corn Tortillas I have ever seen.  Mostly lettuce little else.  We were very dissapointed.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Best food in the valley! You must like spicy food. Service is great! Margaritas are strong     and beer is cold. I order the beef chimi with red sauce. You can not go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Warm inviting atmosphere, excellent spicy garlic pork. I recommend the kick ass margaritas!"}
{"text":"I love Los Dos Molinos! This is our go to place - especially the roast pork and tortillas! The service and atmosphere is exceptional!!' Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for months ever since I heard the food is actually spicy here (unlike most mexican/new mexican places I've tried).  The complementary salsas and chips they set down almost immediately confirmed this.  Seriously, the two salsas (green & red) were probably two of the most flavorful and hottest (the red at least) salsas I've ever had at a restaurant.  The Main course (red chili) also had a really good spice level that you don't always find at  american mexican or new mexican restaurants although it wasn't quite as hot as I was anticipating after hearing about this place and seeing the warning on the menu.  If you don't handle spicy food well you might feel differently. The beef itself also had a lot of flavor and was quite tender.  They have pretty decent happy hour too.  As Arnold Schwarzenegger once said \"I'll be back!\"."}
{"text":"Everyone come try the homemade pumpkin empanadas, it's to die for! My favorite dish is a green chicken enchilada with a fried egg right on top, delicious! Also, a OR-G margarita is the perfect drink after a long and stressful day!"}
{"text":"I've lived all over the USA and spent 5 years overseas.   Of all those places, the one thing I missed most (more than anything else, from any place I've ever called home) was food from Los Dos Molinos.     Quite simply, it is so good, so unique, so spicy ... once you are hooked you can't live without it.   I will literally go into withdrawal (and depression) if I don't get this food on a regular basis.  Yes, it is VERY spicy ... but with such incredible flavor.     The best dish, in my opinion, is the Adovada casserole.   Think of a tamale lasagna with advovada pork filling.   This would be my last meal on earth if I had a choice.   The Adovada Ribs are excellent as well.  PS - You can order some of their amazing salsa for take away.   Just in case you need a stash at home like me."}
{"text":"Let me first state that this place should get a 2.5 because of the margarita; otherwise, I would have given it a 2.  So I went to this location with a group of about 8 people.  For the size of our group, the service was pretty good.  And the majority of our group seemed to really enjoy the food here.  Unfortunately, I did not.  I had the \"Los Dos Flautos\"; which was not very flavorful. I've had better.  The decor was very busy and the lightning very dim.  Maybe I just got the wrong dish that night, butt I doubt I'll chance wasting my money on a return visit."}
{"text":"I have tried Los Dos Molinos several times.  After my first time I only went per my visitor's request.  The food is so hot you can't eat.  You end up drinking too much and still hungry.   I know and enjoy authentic mexican food. This is NOT mexican food."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had. Our order was blatantly forgot as other customers that arrived significantly later than us received their food first. After asking about our food twice and waiting 50 minutes, our plates arrived without so much as an apology. I worked as a server and understand nothing is perfect in the restaurant industry, in saying that, when the unexpected occurs, acknowledging the situation to make amends for the customer is the appropriate business decision. After the wait, the least we could have hoped for was good meal. The food was DISGUSTING. The server (and manager supposedly) never came back to see how our meal tasted. After this fiasco, ideally, a smart business owner would have offered to comp a meal, but without any inquiry as to our meals, the check for two entrees was delivered next to two full plates. I asked to speak to manager, at which I was notified the owner was present. I requested to speak with the owner who refused to leave the kitchen and address a paying customer about the \"experience\" her establishment provided. To anyone reading this, I would strongly advise against eating here. As a business, this establishment does not appreciate its customers and does not deserve a penny of your well earned paycheck."}
{"text":"Great food, good Sangria Margarita, and quick service.  We are always impressed with how quickly our food arrives. Love the green chile burrito combo with the beef taco.  The shell is ok, but the shredded beef filling is very tasty. The salsa is nice and spicy so make sure you like it hot."}
{"text":"Cute little place, very nicely decorated. Perfect location, for us :) The posole was SO good! We also had the stacked enchiladas. Both of the entrees had great flavor. CAUTION: when something says spicy, they mean really spicy. The service was OK. We sat at the bar & it was frequently unattended. The bartender was very nice to us, but quite hostile towards his coworkers which made us a little uncomfortable. We'll be back, but we'll sit at a normal table & leave the chiles."}
{"text":"Service is terrible, terrible terrible.  I tried the old location in Ahwatukee 2 times and waked out 2 times before even ordering our food due to no service.  Tried the new location on Mother's Day  thinking maybe the service has improved.  We ended up walking out for the 3rd time.  Once again no one came to our table to serve us and the place was empty.  So my family will continue to drive around south mountain and go to the location on central."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Carne avocado in anything they make is the best."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Los Dos for many years.  I usually go to the Mesa location since that is closest to where I live.  The food is great.  I love the red salsa but it has taken me a long time to graduating from being able to barely dip my chip into it to being able to actually scoop up a tiny bit.  It is very hot and I often end up with heartburn, solely from this salsa since i never get heartburn otherwise.  I always get the enchilada dinner with the egg on top.  It is the best.  i've never had anything else so I can't recommend other items but I do know someone who swears by the machaca chimichanga.   I will agree with other people here who state that the service can be poor.  It is too bad that so many people say that same thing.  I would think that the owners would want to change that since they must have heard of this by now!  The last time we ate here, a few weeks ago, we felt like we were intruding by just being there.  The server seemed distracted and too busy to attend to us at all.  I feel like the server is more of an \"order taker\" and that's it.  You are lucky if you ever see the server again since someone eles may bring your food and the check.    But, I'm sure we will visit again...in a few months....to enjoy our favorite enchilada dinner once more."}
{"text":"Wow, so disappointed. A few people I work with told me how great this place was, so I finally decided to give it a try. I am personally a huge fan of Los Taquitos Mexican Grill over on Elliot but hey, I'll try anything once.  My daughter and I went in, just after 5pm, to be greeted but no one. Finally a guy walks out of the back and seats us. We are sitting in the bar area which is fine cause the place was empty other than an older couple sitting in the back corner.  We got our chips and salsa and wow, just, yuck. The runny green one tasted like raw garlic and the red pasty one was hot but flavorless.   After looking over the menus we were both shocked at the limitation of it. My daughter asked the server the difference between the regular tostada and the guacamole one, she was told the regular one was just shell and beans. She questioned about lettuce and tomato and he said, no, maybe, sometimes to make it look nice.... I am sorry, WHAT?   I ordered a chicken Chimichanga with red sauce, the red sauce tasted like powdered chili power and chimi itself was soggy with dry chicken in it. My daughters guacamole tostada was soggy as well. The rice and beans side dish, that they charge 4 bucks for, was disgusting, the rice was clumped together with congealed cheese on it and the beans looked like the Ranch brand beans directly out of the can.  Service was so slow, but I did see one of the bartenders and what was either the owner or manager chatting with people who were seemly regulars.   All I can say is never again, I'd rather go to a 'hole in the wall' like Los Taquitos for good quality food, than this over priced wanna be restaurant. The outdoor patio and table service don't make up for the crap food and horrid staff."}
{"text":"Awesome.  I guess it's a New Mexican hot, and New Mexican variation of Mexican food that is suppose to burn more in your throat than on your tongue?  That's what my friends we're saying but I was to busy being blown away to notice where the hot was coming from.  Definitely Hot, we were all destroyed, we know that dairy is the only thing that combats hot, and so my husband who's not quite the toughest at spice asked for two orders of sour cream, we thought we saw the waiter chuckle but we're not sure.  :)  Oh and my friend who hates sour cream said that she liked their sour cream, and it was really good.  Fresh just made Guacamole, amazing.  Adovada was amazing.  Sangria Margarita so good.  Almost everything served here is hot, they say on their menu they have  no mild, so just a heads up.  Even my beans were hot!  Casual dining in a strip mall festively decorated, including decorated suspended ceiling tiles.  The kind of local place that you know is going to be good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants ever, and I love the south Phoenix location.  My favorite is the adovada relleno.  The relleno is delicious and the adovada is perfection, slow roasted, flavorful and tender.  Pretty much everything here is spicy (recommend a margarita to curb the fire!  I love the mango and the prickly pear), but I think there are a few things (chicken, shrimp) that aren't too spicy.    Everything here is cheesy and saucy and just perfect.  Another favorite is the beef enchiladas with an egg on top.  Weekends are busy, expect to wait if you arrive after 6pm, but get a drink and some chips and salsa and hang out in the courtyard.  Weeknights are less crowded.  (Except during spring training, when everything is crowded!)"}
{"text":"This is a humble eatery, a pleasant surprise in the midst of a sordid neighborhood. The restaurant is choc-a-bloc on a weekend evening. So it is best to arrive around 7 pm, not later than that.  As indicated on their menu they start preparing the food only after the order is placed leading to a considerably long wait (45 mins to one hour). However, during the waiting period their customers have quite a few occupations like looking at the paraphernalia on the walls, sipping margaritas, devouring the crunchy tacos, listening to the loud Spanish music or looking at what other people are eating.   Whatever their clients choose to do, there comes a time when the waiter places the hot plate on the table, they pick up the fork, take a mouthful and then there is calm in the din of Los Dos Molinos. In fact there is a near- Nirvana experience with every bite of the carnitas or enchiladas.   At the end the brusque manner of the waiting staff is forgotten, so is the long wait and restlessness."}
{"text":"This place is a truly authentic Mexican food experience. It is unlike any americanized mexican food I've ever had. The sauces were so unique. Trying the shrimp garlic, it had a light peppery sauce with pinto beans and rice as a side dish. You are rarely served pinto beans at a mexican restaurant. It added to the dish. The salsa was extremely hot but if you are into burning your mouth until it's numb, this is the real stuff! The sopapillo dessert was served warm with drizzled honey and cinnamon. It was light and melted in your mouth.  I enjoyed the quality of the staff too, the female hostesses looked like they stepped out of the movie Frida or a flamenco club. Outdoor seating in the desert winter had a beautiful added touch of flamed fire heaters. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Been going to Los Dos Molinos with my parents since my mom was pregnant with me and have loved it ever since. If you like SPICY, this is the place for you!! You can't go wrong with the green chile blue corn stack enchilada with an egg on top. The beans they make are DELISH slurrrrrppp I'm hungry just thinking about it!  Authentic mexican food and large portions. Plus you can't go wrong with a pitcher of their strong and tasty sangria to go with your spicy meal!"}
{"text":"I say I will never return after waiting 1.5 hours to eat mediocre food, but I do it anyway, Maybe it is me hoping that It will be better the next time I go. It was as disappointing as the last 8 times have been there!  Had friends in town visiting and they wanted to meet and eat there. We got there with a large group, and was told if we call an hour ahead of time, we would be OK. Wrong! It was a Saturday night and of course it was busy. So I understand that. The wait is not bad because of the bar outside, but $3 for chips and salsa? $21 for a pitcher of Ice and Sangria (more ice)? luckily there are comfy seats to consume the overpriced drinks with a bunch of grouchy hungry people!   Finally a gentleman from our group went in and said we would squeeze into a corner booth if they let us. That is what we did. I did not mind the squeezing, actually it was kinda fun. But after we ordered the drinks and then waiting for a waiter who was a smart ass - It was getting old.   The interior is cool, the booths are an old carved wood and with all the crap on the walls, you know there is some history. The patio is comfy in the springtime, but feels like the owners took their old patio furniture to work. There is plenty of places to sit, but it is someway awkward. Careful, You might turn an ankle on the patio with all the chairs.  Ordered the Blue Corn Chicken Enchiladas with Red Chile. I know this place is not a New Mexican style place. My family roots are in New Mexico and I know what is Hot and good New Mexico cooking. So I do not know why I expected that from my order. The food came and is was not a heaping large portion of rice and beans and entree like you normally get. I thought that was chincy.   I dug into the meal and found the tortilla to look like it was a dyed blue, not a real blue corn tortilla! My wife's order came with rice and she barely got a spoonful portion. WTH? Where was the meat? The rice use to be hot too, but someone must have raised hell that it made all the food so spicy that there was no flavor. Now it is a normal mexican food place boring rice. Although spicy, everyone was on the clean plate club, not because it was not good, but because we were starving!   One person in the group ordered the Tamale, and it looked REALLY GOOD! She said it was good.   Dinner at 6:30 - it was not going to happen. We finally left at 9:45! Everyone left kinda disappointed. I left muttering the same words... never again!"}
{"text":"The food is waaaaaay overpriced! Its just okay food.... so you must be paying for the owners to squander money elsewhere... Be super alert because the neighborhood is dangerous!  The waitstaff are condescending.     Si Senor in Chandler is so much better."}
{"text":"New Mexican food this is not.  At best I would call it your standard Mexican food in both flavor and presentation.  If you are looking for new Mexican fare in Phoenix your out of luck.  There have been some gems in Phoenix but unfortunately they do not exist anymore."}
{"text":"Love Los Dos!  The margaritas are excellent, the food is delicious and the service is always friendly.  They have accommodated parties of 22 as easily and happily as they do parties of 2. When I get a Mexican/Margarita craving, this place always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love Los Dos. Love the atmosphere, Love the decor, Love the crap on the walls, Love the sign that says, Please control your kids (and friends). Love the food. Love the shrimp entrees, Love the veggie burro (enchilado style, of course - deep fried and drenched in cheese), Love the margaritas that are bigger than my head and Love Love Love the oh so soft and chewy sopapillas (with honey, of course).  The service, on the other hand, is a little more... complex.  One time when we were waiting for a table, when the guy called my name he called, \"Last chance for Mark D\". Last chance? So we jumped up and ran inside just before he gave our table away to someone else. I said WTF? He said, I called your name three times (He did so NOT call my name three times - we were sitting right in front of the door the entire time - there's no way). So I told him that. And we argued about it, went back and forth like.. did TOO, did NOT, did TOO, did NOT), until I spotted the other guy - the nice guy - standing behind him shaking his head (they've kind of got this good cop / bad cop thing going over there), and the nice guy was just shaking his head, as if to say, \"Ah, don't worry about him, he's just in a bad mood.\" So we didn't, we sat down, ate some fabulous food, downed some rocking 'ritas and had a great time as always.   Here's the thing I want you to take away from that story: Even though it does seem like there's always at least one employee \"in a bad mood\", and the service may not be exactly friendly, it is attentive. I've never had to wait very long for anything, or not gotten what I wanted, I just maybe didn't get it with a smile. And for me, for this place, that's fine. That's just the way it is there. I think it helps knowing that going in. In my opinion, the food and atmosphere more than make up for it. Hell, I keep going back and back and back and back..."}
{"text":"when I want authentic New Mexico style spicy food, I go to Los Dos. The carnitas and flautas are the best"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and get you what you asked for. There were about 5 servers in total for the whole restaurant. It seemed very lenient in this restaurant. We had a party of 9 and they got every order correct and we didn't have any problems. No complaints about the staff. The food on the other hand could've been better. We ordered cheese crisps and the tortillas taste very bread-like (I've had tons of tortillas without this wheat taste). The cheese tasted like the cheese you buy in the stores, and wasn't melted that much. I ordered flautas and they tasted normal. The beans were eh and the rice was eh too. This place is average I'm sure you could find better. Good service though."}
{"text":"Loved the decor and considering this is a Phoenix staple, im sure it hasnt changed in a long time. Food was very fresh and the service was excellent.  We had Dinner with a good friend visiting from NY, he had never had real Mexican food, I had the Posole\"red\" it was nice and spicy.  MY friend loved the selection of Mexican beers. He said it was the best Mexican food he had ever had.  This will be my new tradition for visitiors to AZ.  Cant wait to go back when the weather is nice and sit outside!"}
{"text":"I've been to Los Dos a few times in recent months, and I am reminded every time I go that I love this place.  Margaritas are amazing, the food is so good and authentic and spicy, and the ambiance is awesome.  The service always sucks, so if you have an impatient mother-in-law, take her elsewhere.  Now that you know that, it is absolutely worth it.  pop an extra xanax, slug down a margarita on the patio (if, of course, you have a sense of reckless abandon and good health insurance) and wait for the glory.  If the words \"Machaca Crispies\" are on the specials board, ask for at least two of them.  Even if you are by yourself.  Especially if you are by yourself.  Everything on the menu is tasty; you really can't go wrong.  I brought my mother, sister and her two babies here.  When my mother asked the overly busy waiter which of the salsas were mild, I was tickled when he took a moment of his time to look at her with mildly disgusted contempt and reply, \"Neither.\"  For that, five stars."}
{"text":"Awesome and SPICY!!!! The usual fare but this place makes it spicier than the rest somehow. Nice restaurant and beautiful decor. Good eats and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visiting the area and Los Dos Molinos was recommended.  What a treat!    Portions were large.  Menu had enough variety that the varied palates of my family had choices.  I highly recommend the house margarita."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and I decided its time to write a review. The food is pretty good. We tried the green corn tamales, chilli relleno and chimichanga. Spicy! Sopapiyas was the only dessert available and good. I would love to return for the tamales. The service is terrible and slow."}
{"text":"GREAT food, Carlos is amazing. Becoming here for over a year. See us coming and with a wave hello, drinks and food are on the way. Lunch or dinner, this place is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Had a beef taco salad was gross. I don't know  what all hype is about. Saw my waiter once and did not see her until it was time to pay my bill. Will not go back again."}
{"text":"Love this place. A weekly tradition for my family and I. The ribs are a must try. Great margaritas too."}
{"text":"Ugh. I want to love this place like some of my friends, but going to the original one and waiting for hours just to get some special \"Hot\" food has left me feeling not positive for the visit to this new location.   Went on a Wednesday with the Mrs and a friend that pushed me through the door. Same Padre's feel... I was feeling better. Got seated right away and got chips and salsa and waters pretty quick... alright! and then we sat, and sat, and sat. We were in a little room in the front where the entrance to the patio was and could see all the servers headed in and out with drinks and food. I knew it was too good to be true. Finally got a drink order in and he was def hurried. no small talk, just wanted you to order. I think the the place was maybe 1/3 full.   Got drinks and then waited for about 15 minutes. WTF! Finally ordered with not even a \"Eff You!\" from the waiter. At least it gave us time to catch up and take in the decor. Food came and looked better than i remembered. But the food was the same... Meh. (see other LDM review) Meh NM style food. My family is from NM. I grew up on the stuff! This is just hot to tasteless, salty plate of rice and beans!   I would come back to have HH at the bar. area At least Padre's left that to still be enjoyed."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for our food, which showed up to be only mediocre. They had live music which was decent."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the only other review on here didn't get to eat here before reviewing. I doubt he would have given them 5 stars.   We went here as a family for lunch one Saturday a few weekends ago. They have opened this place way to soon. The experience was horrible. There was a warning when we walked in that they had a limited menu and they were still training their staff. So I could expect some issues I guess but not as bad as we got.  I was excited that they had opened up and I love Mexican food. There were four of us and my son ended up not eating. I got a beef burrito, my wife got two beef tacos and my daughter a bean and cheese burrito. The meat they use must have been sitting in a pot of water before they served it to us. My wifes tacos were really soggy and you could drain the liquid off the plate. The same for by burrito. I really wish I knew what it was soaking in because it tasted funny (like a weird chemical) as well.  The service was bad as you could guess from my rating and the warning we we got walking in. She must have never served before. I used to be a server so I know how hard it is. Especially when it's Mexican food. We only ordered sodas but spilled  someone else's full beer all over my daughter as well as the shattered glass it came in. We were pretty nice about the whole ordeal. Still we never saw a manger and we were never offered any sort of compensation ( a free desert can go a long way and it's still not cost a lot of money). We had to ask for chips and salsa and her reply was that she thought she had already brought them out to us even though you could clearly see that we didn't have any on the table.  While we were there they ran out of diet coke. They also randomly decided to close the place at 2pm and they were turning away business. I guess they realized how bad it sucked at the moment. We drove a by there a few day later and noticed  a paper taped to their door (thats how they communicated they were closing when we were there) that said they would not be open that day and would not honor reservations for the evening.  I know I was warned but I just didn't think it could be that bad. And our bill ended up being around 50 bucks for the three of us. They charge 8 bucks for chips and salsa refills.   I don't know how the heck this place is going to last but I doubt I will be back anyways."}
{"text":"We've been going to this restaurant for 25+ years, since it was in an old A frame building down the street. I can't say enough about the food and the staff. The enchiladas are amazing, especially with shredded beef or adovada. Although the chile is spicy, there are options for those who don't like it hot. The shredded beef burro is chock full of tender, flavorful beef and the shredded beef and guacamole tostada is fresh and delicious. Add a pitcher of their amazing margaritas and I am one happy camper!  Staff is friendly and efficient and the owner/manager John always makes us feel welcome. Hope to be a loyal customer of Los Dos for 25 more years."}
{"text":"Plenty of good, spicy New Mexican grub. The standard menu has the standards - tacos, tostados, enchiladas, which are fine for lunch, and would be even better for late night noshing if they were open later than the posted closing hour of 9PM.   I went there for dinner with my brother from Apache Junction and my son from California. They get there more frequently than I do, coming in from New York, and I can see why it's one of their favorite Phoenix area  eating places.  We arrived about 7:30 on a weekday night and were lucky to get the last table for 3 or 4. We started off with the 'Kick-Ass' pitcher of Margaritas, at $29 ,eight bucks more than the House Pitcher, but at least assured that it actually had some alcoholic content. We were right.  In addition to the House Specialties on the regular menu, there was another sheet of Daily Specials. Every item on it, except one, had the traditional hot pepper beside it, indicating Spicy (New Mexico Chili). I knew this was my kind of place. Just to make sure, we requested and used (sparingly) a bottle of Hot Sauce for the table.  I got the roast pork dish from the Daily Special menu. Tender, juicy, flavorful, and highly recommended.  Plenty to eat and drink; no need to waste your time on appetizers or desserts. Well, maybe some guacamole and chips while you're waiting. Attentive service makes it a pleasure to eat here. I understand that they also have an outpost in the Flatiron District in NYC, near Union Square, and about a block from a branch of Rosa Mexicana. Comparative review coming up."}
{"text":"Fantastic local flavor, delicious frozen margaritas (I had the Prickly Pear, yum!). Food is spicy, but not overpowering - little too much for the girlfriend, so be careful if you have a girlie palate. :-)"}
{"text":"Visited this location on 2 occasions. Both times we were served water and chips and nobody returned to take our order. We will not go back a 3rd time."}
{"text":"It is with great pleasure I can give this place 5 stars again.  I've been a frequent customer for the last 21 years to this restaurant(baseline and central/chandler and 40th st).  I've ALWAYS enjoyed the food, but sometimes the service was dicey.  I wanted to try the new location and did so today.  I talked my neighbors into going and I was a instant hero for doing so.  I always get the #6 combo with an extra side of sour cream(it cuts the heat down perfectly).  It honestly was the best #6 I've had in 21 years!!  I had the same plate at the baseline location last week, but it was just average (but still good).  My neighbor had the chicken tamale and said it was \"perfect!\"  My other buddy had something not on the menu, but was recommended by George, the waiter.  I think it was 2 chili rellenos with pork and a fried egg in it.  All of our plates were clean before we left.   Other things I notice.  How professional the staff was.  2. How open the layout was in the restaurant.  3. Clean/new/good size bathrooms.  Probably the best thing about the new location is that it's closer to my house!!!. I'll be back.....soon!!!"}
{"text":"The food is way too spicy.  Thankfully, I got a soft chicken taco that didn't have any sauce on it and that was quite good.  Still, not amazing.  Find it so hard to believe that this place is so renowned.  $30 for lunch for 2 with no drinks and not that much food seems insane - and half of our food was way too hot to eat.  The atmosphere was very lack luster.  Unlike other folks experience, the service was good but, I won't be seeking this place out again."}
{"text":"My family came here a little over a year ago and had a pretty awful experience, so I have steered clear of this place for a while. My brother had a craving for Mexican, so we decided to give it a second chance. We went on a Monday around 5 so there very few other patrons. We were given prompt service and asked whether we wanted a booth or a table which is nice! I also liked that they immediately gave out water- I remembered from my first experience that they didn't bring out water until after the chips and salsa and I thought my tongue was going to burn off. Now that I knew how spicy the food was, I wasn't caught so off guard. However, I do think they should offer a milder version, since it's almost impossible to eat the salsa. My mom and I split some sort of plate/sampler and a guacamole appetizer. I found that I was actually able to eat the green chile sauce as long as I followed it up with some guac. My brother really enjoyed his enchiladas which also came with a green chile sauce. I agree that the iPad system is awfully tacky- I've seen other shops use an iPad just fine, but the waiters need to not announce the total of the bill and have an option to write your own tip. Overall, our second trip was a million times better than our first, although I will still probably never come here again, not with so many better options out there."}
{"text":"Best New Mexican food around!  Fun atmosphere, super friendly service, fantastic food and good prices!  Is a weekly stop for me!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that the restaurant moved to the new Warner location.  It was a pleasant surprise.  Last evening had plans to hit a happy hour at Philly's and accidentally found Los Dos right next door.  No brainer...we went to Los Dos instead.  The service was awesome and the food was amazing!!     I will most likely hit them up again for lunch today.  :)"}
{"text":"Four stars my butt... ZERO STARS IS MORE LIKE IT. You guys, honestly a taco from taco-bell is much better. I mean how do you screw up a Shredded Beef Taco? ITS THE EASIEST THING TO MAKE. But seriously, the shell tasted like crap I buy better ones at the store & they put some nasty rice like crap in it to make it look like it stuffed with meat when really it's not.. I will say the salsa was alright but even then taco bell packed salsa is better. If you eat here I recommend you get a few drinks in before you put your tastebuds through that garbage."}
{"text":"I don't know what Frommers was thinking when they rated this place a *find* -  I think it should have stayed lost.  Ross and I have been trying to eat there for three years.  Every time we tried to stop in we discovered a wait list of an hour and a crowded patio of waiting (read: drunk on margaritas) patrons.    One night our timing was perfect and we got in with a 5 minute wait. I can't imagine what all the hooplah is about that place.  I can only speculate that the folks who are waiting an hour to get a table are so drunk that their tastebuds are numb when they finally get to eat.  I was very underwhelmed. So much so that I don't even want to spend the energy describing what I got to eat (tamales).  What's worse is that I didn't even like the chips in salsa.  Now that's pathetic.  Native and tourists - stay away."}
{"text":"Finally went to this place after driving by it dozens, if not hundreds of times and first thing I found is it looks so much nicer on the inside. Plenty of room inside and outside and the food is just absolutely amazing and top notch. I dream about it haha. Probably the best Mexican food I've ever had in my life, and is pretty easy on the wallet considering how good it is (it's not dirt cheap but it's not expensive either, and I'm usually pretty stingy). Quality food and quality atmosphere. It's just fun, and nice and delicious and the servers are very professional and good at what they do. It's like it's solid and understated, but definitely a fun experience. Easiest 5 stars I ever gave in my life. You need to go to this place!"}
{"text":"This is my number one Mexican choice. You have to like spicy food. If you don;t you will hate it and probably write an inappropriately bad review. Carne adovada ribs and shrimp vera cruz are the only two choices in my opinion. If you get something else, it's at your own risk of wishing you had ordered one of these two items. I always order the beer on draft, unless it's a night for some margaritas which will knock you out (a little expensive, but really strong). The downtown location is my favorite, followed by the Mesa joint. Downtown has the best scenery but you have to wait a long ass time. I love this place."}
{"text":"The only thing good about our meal was the prickly pear margarita and the fact that the manager comped the food because we complained. The enchilada was so hard it was impossible to cut and contained no cheese inside - the shredded meat in the taco tasted like it was made several days ago. The chips were dry and not very tasty - also seemed stale. I would say that this food is some of the worst Mexican I have ever had - I would rather eat Taco Bell and that is saying a lot! Oh and they closed at 9 on a Friday - I would give them 2 months."}
{"text":"Have heard mixed reviews, so we thought we would try the Warner Rd location in Ahwatukee. Once we were seated, several minutes passed before someone brought out chips and water. The waiter eventually took our order and we ended up waiting approx 20 mins or longer for our food. Our drinks never arrived and we had to ask a waiter for them. Once the food arrived, it was warm to room temperature, but tasted excellent. (#5 beef burro with green chili). We also watched another waiter partially sneeze on a tray of chips and water for another table. While eating a strong smell of marijuana was in the dining area, which probably came from the parking lot and through the open patio doors. We also noticed there were no female employees, which could be the reason for the crappy service"}
{"text":"Food was excellent (on the spicer side, so if you like mild be sure to say so when you order), so was the service.  The prices are a bit high though; our bill for 2 was nearly $60 and the margarita was very weak.  1 dinner item, and 1 drink each, chips & salsa."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ended up here on an early Saturday afternoon after our favorite sushi place let us down with their inconsistent hours.....again....and since we were scheduled for a house showing nearby, we decided to try something else in the area.   I do believe, once upon a time, I stumbled upon this establishment in search of some better, close-to home Mexican offerings, b/c lets be honest--Arriba's is nothing special--however, i don't recall seeing such a positive review for this place so i was a little skeptical to go against my fellow yelpers, and to trust my boyfriends \"better\" judgement.   Nevertheless, we arrived and were promptly greeted and brought to our table. Granted, they had just opened, so it's not like they were doing much else. I was a little taken back with their menu, as i truly expected menu items such as what you'd see at every generic Mexican restaurant...and their pricing was a little higher than expected....i admit, i was a little curious, and slightly ready to walk out b/c me and new things, well, lets just say we're not well acquainted.   Now, if I weren't in a good mood, i'd take away a star for the lack of communication skills our server had, outside of telling us their food is \"hot\"....later confirming, he means spicy hot AND temperature hot. Great...because a) i don't like cold food, and b) i suppose it's always good to know things are naturally hot before dumping extra salsa on my food for some extra heat. WHEW! I digress....  So here's how it went  -waters to drink (I was fighting a cold...so i can't speak of their bar tending skills....although i will say i was delightfully surprised with their selection and overall decor. very nice)  - chips & salsa: chips weren't soggy/greasy, were warm & had nice flavor while the salsas were kickin' with heat and very flavorful....and most importantly, didn't like as though it came from a jar!  -boyfriend ordered chicken enchilada and added green chili, and i ordered a blue corn tamale with some weird named spicy pork that i don't remember: both were ordered a la carte, and were sized exceptionally well. I don't know how people could make either of those a combo with rice and beans, because i struggled with one measly tamale. But don't let it stop you from trying!  I whole heartedly was blown away with the amount of flavors that came pouring into my mouth with this tamale. Even with a cold i could taste them, and the spiciness was there without being too intense that you couldn't enjoy the meal.   boyfriends had cheese, so I couldn't try any and fill you in, but his empty plate and constant praise is a HUGE indication. And because none of you know him, let me just tell you, he NEVER raves about food...ever.   We will definitely be going back, maybe for dinner and add some cocktails just to see how much game this place really has. But give it a shot...i'm glad i did!"}
{"text":"My first impression was good: the chips were adequate and the salsa seemed fresh.  Beyond that, the chicken taco salad was bland, the chicken burro was too salty and dry, and the chile relleno was excessively salty and cheesy.  Los Dos Molinos demonstrates that quantity is not necessarily better than quality as the saltiness of almost all the dishes overwhelmed any other flavor and the large portion sizes were futile.  The largest culprit was the beef tamale, which was so salty it was inedible.  Some redeeming factors were the service and live music."}
{"text":"I love this place! When ever I have time to make it down to the area I always eat there. It is a great place to stop in for a quick spicy tastey lunch! The salsas are amazing and anything I have ever ordered from there is great. The staff is also great! Very welcoming laid back place to eat."}
{"text":"This is a small and undoubtedly underappreciated gem, recommended by a friend. Lovely patio, out of this world food. Margaritas are generous and well-done. Next visit to Phoenix, I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Decent prices (except for the sangria @ $9). The rice was awful, dry and hard. The salsa however was excellent, especially the green salsa. I had the chile relleno, which was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Walk in and the place smells like a group of people urinated on the carpet a long time ago.   Next, the food was overpriced - to say the least.   Here is our example:  I had a tortilla, with egg, beans, cheese.  The price: $13+tax+tip.  We would have walked out immediately if not for the restaurant.com coupon.  When we saw our bill we were shocked:  the tiny cup of green salsa that normally comes with a burrito: $3.  A tiny bit of guacamole inside the burrito:  $4.   Even with a $15 discount we wound up spending $12 each for the crappiest (cheap tasting ingredients, awful general taste) lunch I have had in a long time - in budget friendly Phoenix  The only other diners looked as if they were old enough to have lost their taste buds, but I doubt they will be back either from the look on their faces.  There must be drug money flowing to keep this place afloat.   We were treated so shamelessly that even if I rarely spend time to write a poor review I took the time to write this one.  You will find that positive reviews here are from a previous ownership.  This really deserves 0 stars but the minimum is 1."}
{"text":"Here's the thing.... You can feel the quality of the meat in each bite and you can taste a hint of a yummy marinade here and there but they really overdid the spicy thing here. Spicy is an understatement. I like spicy food, but you can take a crappy burrito and add original spicy salsa to it and it could taste decent. But why do this to amazingly thoughtful Mexican food? I think thy should take it down a notch so you can truly enjoy the quality of the tastes that they have masked in their tender meats and marinades. I would have given it 5 stars with the ambiance and grub but, unfortunately 3 for now. Ps service is great. Love that there are all different ages doing there too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.... if u can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen.... homemade sauce and salsa... my go to place... the drinks are amazing friendly staff... and best of all family owned... what an amazing family and restaurants...."}
{"text":"For a place that has been in business for years, this fact amazes me. Service was horrible. Complete cluster of when we could be seated. Finally seated and waited 30 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge we were there. Asked a busboy and waited another 10 minutes. Finally got in a drink order. Had to ask the waiter twice if he could take our food order. He looked like he was HIGH AS A KITE. Food was so-so. Margarita was lame. Service pathetic. WON'T BE BACK. TOO MANY other alternatives in this town."}
{"text":"I'm taking a star off of my review of Los Dos in Mesa. After returning to again enjoy their HEAVEN ON EARTH cheese enchiladas I have decided that the waitstaff is too negligent, the service is too slow and the experience in general just basically sucks. It's too bad, too, because their food remains amazing, but when you have to wait to get seated, wait to get menus, wait to get chips/salsa, wait to get drinks ordered, wait to get your food, wait unsuccessfully for refills, ask busboy for refills, wait unsucessfully for more salsa, ask busboy for more salsa, wait unsuccessfully for your waitress to look your way at all for anything, wait unsuccessfully for a check, give up and go to register without check and wait for someone to show up to look for your check... well, I think you're getting the idea. At this, the Mesa location, waiting is the name of the game. I'm not that into waiting, sorry. I'm going to try the Central location on Washington next. Maybe that's how I'll be able to keep up my jones."}
{"text":"Great down and dirty Mexican. Chips 1st quality: substantial. Salsas tasty and spicy. Chicken Victoria tender. Didn't have, but the Sopapillas look awesome. Fun colorful atmosphere, good mex music."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Food is consistently good, great family runs the restaurant, great service. I eat here once a week and would HIGHLY recommend it if you like great Mexican food and great people! My go to dish is the green chili chicken casserole! Absolutely the best!"}
{"text":"I love the food, but the Ahwatukee location needs help. We have gone twice in the last two months. Both times, they did not have enough staff. Both times they were out of guacamole. The interior still looks like the sushi restaurant that was in the space before Los Dos. Either invest in the place, or close it. The current situation is killing the good reputation of the rest of the locations."}
{"text":"Walked in and the place seemed cool, super busy on a Tuesday which is indicative of good food. So service was stretched and  they knew it. ,We've all been there and it happens, especially at popular places. Margarita was nothing special, but MASSIVE. The hair in my carnitas was special haha. It happens and its not worth blasting but they could be SOOO muchbetter if they tried."}
{"text":"Posolé or Pozolé. Whichever way you choose to spell it - Los Dos is the place to get it.  All of the choices on their menu are done right - there are very few places we've found that know how to use the chilies (take your pick - red or green). Los Dos does."}
{"text":"I do not like you either.  I mean its obvious you must not like me, serving shredded chicken in a burrito that tastes CANNED!  You call that salsa? That is hot sauce in a cup. Come on. I like spicy food, but give a guy some options here.  No bar area either...thats kind of lame.  So yeah, we won't ever be friends. I'll be down the street at Pancho's instead."}
{"text":"Man the food is so good. If you come you have to ask for the secret menu. The chicharones are off the wall. Service is awesome and so personable"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food. I'm from NY/NJ and the food here makes me so envious of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Craving oversalted, overspiced (but not flavorful) overpriced food?  Then this place is for you.  (Especially if you like slack bordering-on-surly service.)  The drinks are strong, which is a bonus as it helps you forget the food.  Seriously, Ahwatukee needs a good sitdown Mexican Restaurant.  Still."}
{"text":"I have had my limit of dealing with this restaurant's hours. It is closed more often than it is open. I cannot tell you how many times I have driven out of my way to go here, only to yet again see a sign saying something along the lines of \"IT'S VAGUELY CHRISTMAS, WE WILL BE CLOSED FOR FOURTEEN WEEKS\" or \"IT'S THE FIFTH MONDAY OF THE MONTH WE ARE CLOSED FROM 11AM TO 6PM,\" or some other variation on that theme. I won't be going back. Hey Los Dos: even BANKS don't keep hours like this anymore!  Edit: and they reply to me with a snarky message that attempts to explain to me like I'm a child how they're a family business and they've done just fine for 40 years thank you very much and how overworked they are to boot. I guess every other restaurant in the city is using slave labor then? Yeah, OK, sure, Los Dos. You're a special flower. Whatever. I'm very pleased for you that you've made it 40 years with your stupid hours. You will henceforth be doing so without me."}
{"text":"We've been here about 4 or 5 times & the food is always just as good or better when we come. We love the *free* cheese crisp ( when you check in on Yelp) with the green chilis. Amazing! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have ever had...I always get some to take home for breakfast !!!!  R.S."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I took a friend out to lunch and decided to try Los Dos Molinos on Chandler Blvd......what a big mistake!  Ordered a burrito which was dry and not much flavor.  The salsa was way to hot.   My friend didn't like what she ordered either.  The food was way overpriced for what we got.  We both wished we had gone to Taco Bell instead!"}
{"text":"WOW, what a MASSIVE let down.  been going here for almost 20 years.  this place USED to be THE place for the wickedest mexican food, great service, and a total party..  Went the other friday, place was a ghost town (clue #1).  The guys hosting told us it would be 15 minutes (the place was only half full, clue #2), and THEN told us to wait outside in the heat!  I even asked if they even wanted us there and he flat out said \"I don't care\".  Considering the location and my past fondness, our party of 8 stayed... I had been talking this place up to my friends from Peru and Colombia.  Should have known from the start...the food ended up being lously...and not a little, 4 of us got no sleep from cramping.  I think they scraped the bottom of the barrel for our red sauce, it looked more like spicy red paste.  Sad to say this is the end of an era for me, I WILL NEVER go back.  This was the only restaurant I would welcome a 1 hour wait for a table at...no longer.  The sisters use to run it, one of them past a few years back, and now it looks like the boys are running...don't waste your time, the Los Dos Molinos of old that got all the great reviews is dead."}
{"text":"Nothing positive to say about this place. Absolutely awful. We ordered three plates at lunch. Shredded beef tacos: no beef, no taste of what beef there was, no salsa and no guacamole. Worse yet, taco shells were factory shells and cold to the touch. Carnitas plate ok, roast pork fatty, with minimal spice and taste. One tortilla came with such an expensive plate, request another? pay for another tortilla. By the way, order a soda, your refill will be charged too. Garlic shrimp plate for third meal, shrimp without flavor and presented with dry unflavored rice, and beans on both plates appeared old. Surroundings? took 35 minutes to get to this hole in the wall restaurant in the middle of no where. interior dark, seats old, lumpy and seat backs loose and tight to table. Not sure if table top was cleaned lately, as interior too dark to tell really. Service? not really, no joy here. $65.00 meal for three persons at lunch? with one bottled beer and a house margarita, unbelievably bad. Don't have the heart to tell my friend who recommended this dive about our experience. Can you imagine, any real Mexican restaurant would not have a Carne Asada plate on the menu? Unbelievable. Truly, two tacos at Jack-in-the-Box for .99 have more meat and taste then what we experienced today. Stomach upset on the way home, had to pull over . . . ."}
{"text":"One too many stars  wanted to try a new place with high rates from Yelp. I found  Los Dos Molinos. When I walk in the restaurant It was very dark and it also had a very weird smell  inside. Thank god I had to watch my hands so I used the restroom and its was dark and very dirty but wait it gets better. I found a huge roach in the sink      I'm not sure why this restaurant is open but if I was you don't go to Los Dos Molinos. STOP READ THIS"}
{"text":"Awful! I went this past Friday to try out the new location. There was no one there to great us and no one was taking peoples names. We had to line up in the doorway where there was no air conditioning as well. I left after 30 minutes because no one was being seated and there was no one to ask any questions to. I called the restaurant after I left to complain and the person on the phone told me that they were too busy to talk to me! I would expect more from a restaurant that has been in business in the valley for so long. I'd avoid this place until they get their act in gear."}
{"text":"Some of the reviews here are ridiculous (1 star because they use an iPad?!?).  Los Dos Molinos has, by far, the best Mexican food in Ahwatukee and is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix.  If you don't like spicy, go somewhere else. There is no \"mild\" or \"medium\" here - you either get non-spicy or cry-and-sweat crazy spicy.  The service is phenomenal. Some of the waiters aren't great, but the owner is so determined to make everything perfect she more than makes up for some of the crappy waiters. And the food - amazing. Delicious, spicy, perfect.  Highly recommended if you like spicy Mexican food."}
{"text":"Greatest Mexican food in Phoenix. Every time we come back to the valley, we eat here. Tried so many things on the menu, my wife always asks if pesole is available. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it is not."}
{"text":"Meh. Average quality overpriced. Not a fan."}
{"text":"i am appalled that this is rated at 3 stars!! some of the best new mexican i have ever had, and that is saying a lot because i am not really into food that is very spicy/hot. i prefer the red chili as it is less spicy than the green but both are amazing. my wife had a chicken chimi and i had a machaca chimi and both were great, we sat at the bar and were served promptly. PEOPLE DO NOT LET THE 3 STAR RATING FOOL YOU, you are missing out on something great if you skip this place."}
{"text":"We had made a reservation @ Los Dos for 9 people including 2 children. Imagine our dissapointment when we arrived to find that our reservation had been given away because we were 5 minutes late  with parking and getting the children out of the car..There was no offer to make us up another table right away although there  were several empty tables. No apology was offered.  I guess since it is a successful  restaurant  they now feel that they can treat their customers  with contempt."}
{"text":"Food is good and spicy 5 stars for that. But when it comes to service 1 star. They feel they are doing you a favor when in reality Im doing them the favor by going to spend my money there. To the owner, you may have good food, but without customers your  food is no good. Im sure with the sales you make you can afford to hire one or two more friendly servers. Good luck"}
{"text":"This place is Amazing stop yelping and go eat here. I'm a taqueria snob from chicago (yes we have awesome Mexican food) and I'm in love. Came two nights in a row it's that good.   Food is rich and flavorful (try the stew!) and the perfect amount of spice (I like spicy food).   Green salsa and chips are amazing.   Margs are awesome.   Why are you still reading?! Go eat."}
{"text":"So yummy. The margaritas were very powerful. Awesome ambiance. Exactly what we were looking for."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night with a group of 4...the place was packed and the waiters were super busy-understandable.  Only got one refill for water, food wasn't warm, had to flag our waiter down since he never checked up on us after we got out food. The tamales were crap, beef tacos were good though.  I would've liked to exchange the tamale I got for another beef taco but our waiter never came back...  Food is ok- but is OVERPRICED. I have had WAY better Mexican food and service is important to me so I wont be back."}
{"text":"First off, I am pleased to see them come to our neighborhood.   My dining companion \"Ahwatukee F\" and I stopped in there recently for a late lunch. Having previously been to their South Central location a few times in the past, I expected delicious, very hot food, but with service that is, to put it mildly, \"disengaged\" at best.   I was right about the food, but completely wrong about the service we experienced.   First the food:   Chips and two salsas were to our table very quickly. The salsas, a red and a green, were visually appealing, fresh and wonderfully hot. (I thought that the green would be milder than the red: Another error on my part, but one I can live with!)    We started with the queso dip, which the server said was made with five different cheeses. It was superb.  For the mains, I had a chicken burrito with red chili sauce enchilada style. It was succulent, very hot and magnificent. (After a fork-filled sample to Ahwatukee F, she declared it the best shredded chicken she had ever tasted. And her mother was born and raised in Sinaloa!)   Ahwatukee F had a slow-roasted pork burrito with green sauce enchilada style. That, too was beyond spectacular.   Yes, the food is spicy hot. and Yes, you may sweat and/or have a runny nose. But if you really like hot foods like we do, you will keep eating and eating it until you run out of room.   Now the service:  Simply put, from the host to the server to an engaging gentleman behind the bar who was sharing his plans for serving tacos on Cinco de Mayo, everyone could not have been nicer, nor more attentive.   Overall, Five Stars! We will be back!  Confession: I did find the iPad Point-of-Sale check out a bit awkward. I would rather contemplate a tip without the server standing over me.   P.S.: I got a belly laugh over another review here that states, \"The food is way too spicy.\" Perhaps a warning is needed for the folks from Minnesota, but anyone who knows the name Los Dos Molinos or New Mexico-style food should expect as much."}
{"text":"First of all, the 2nd star is because my family enjoyed their meal.  I know that with all the positive reviews, your probably thinking that everything there is amazing, however, your wrong. I can't say the other foods weren't good, but I can say that I did not like the taste of the salsa, and the refried beans were very bland. I had a bean and cheese burrito, and im sad to say that it was one of the worst ive had. Like I said, you might love a different food there, but I recommend staying away from the distasteful refried beans."}
{"text":"I am from New Mexico and I really miss the food so I was really happy to see a sign that said \"New Mexico Cuisine\". This is false advertisement. Just cause you use Hatch chile does not make it New Mexico cuisine. And lets be serious, how can you charge $14.00 for beans and rice and for salsa that is to hot to eat. I have more, they dont have a kids menu so you have to buy sides that are over priced.. My niece ordered a $6.00 tostada that literally had 5 beans and a mountain of lettuce. I will stick with Filabertos.... they are cheaper and give bigger portions."}
{"text":"1 star only because food was way too spicey. i was told its the hottest food in phoenix and it is. I f you like it hott go, you'll love it. Good flavors but way too hott for us"}
{"text":"We decided to try Los Dos Molinos because it was mentioned in Phoenix magazine and it is one of the best outside patio areas on Yelp.   It is in an obscure location-not downtown Central.  The patio is very fun and eclectic.  There are three bikes cemented around a fountain and a human-sized Statue of Liberty, etc.    My husband and I were meeting another couple there.  We asked if we could have a drink while we waited for them and the hostess just said, \"No\".  When we asked where we should wait, she seemed put off by the question.  After a table was cleared for us, she asked, \"So, I guess you don't mind sitting at a dirty table?\"  We then got up and waited while they wiped the table down.  After sitting there for ten minutes, we had to ask for menus.    A younger man served us chips and spilled salsa on my pants, new jacket and Coach purse.  I cleaned myself up with napkins and he came back a couple minutes later and asked if I wanted something to wipe off with???   I was in the food industry for years.  Not that I'm looking for free food, but it would have been a nice gesture to at least offer a dessert on the house.    Speaking of chips and salsa.  The chips are thin and crispy, my favorite.  They are served with a red and green salsa, both very spicy.  I like some heat but it would be nice to have a milder (at least medium) salsa as an alternative.     I ordered a house margarita because the same gentleman said they used all premium ingredients.  The mix was awful.  If you've ever been to Rocky Point, they use the same nasty green stuff.  I guess it's authentic!  My friend was smarter than me and ordered the $12 Skinny margarita, which was much better.  Kind of pricey for such a casual restaurant though.    The food was very good.  My shrimp were cooked perfectly.  The beans were unlike anything I've ever had before-they were more of a chili bean, not the typical refried or black beans Mexican food is usually served with.  My husband rarely eats beans and even he loved these.  Everyone was very pleased with their meals.  Our waiter was friendly and efficient.  The food came out fast.    I will give it another shot because the food was exceptional.  Hopefully the customer service will be better next time."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today.  Food was good (at least the portion that made it to me!), but when the server handed me my plate, he let go of it before I had it (he was reaching across the table from the other side) and he spilt the guacamole and sour cream onto my shirt and pants.  Thankfully I caught the rest of the plate before it all slid off.  He stood there for a moment looking at me and then just continued serving food and walked away as if nothing happened!  Thankfully the people I was with gave me some extra napkins they had.  Wiped it up as best I could and hopefully it'll come out in the laundry at home.  Needless to say I'm not impressed by the service."}
{"text":"Super spicy and delicious New Mexico style cuisine. We had three different entrees and all were wonderful. The margaritas were especially tasty, large, and not too sweet. We'd definitely come back! My only complaint is that I wish they had a few more vegetarian options.  Try: The Enchilada Dinner (with red chili and blue corn tortilla)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going here. The family that owns it always makes you feel welcome.  Great food too. Everything is fresh and home made. Sometimes the service is slow but that's because they are busy."}
{"text":"Went there because we heard the food was great. If possible, the food was worse than the service. Sketchy looking building on the outside. Got seated right away. Ten minutes later out server came by. No mild salsa, actually nothing mild to dip your chips in.... If you get chips that is. Got our first batch and had to flag down a bus boy for some more. We had about 6 different people come to the table, none of which came by a second time. FINALLY got our food after what felt like 30 minutes. We were hopeful that the food would make up for the terrible service but we were sadly disappointed. Dry chicken, cold burritos, bland beans. Took seriously 20 minutes to get our check. The ONLY thing good this place has going for it is strong margaritas. SADLY SADLY disappointed and will NOT come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The food is spicy and addictive. The best New Mexican cuisine outside of New Mexico."}
{"text":"I've now been to this location 3 times.  I had previously visited the locations and really enjoyed my meals.  Unfortunately, something seems to be missing here at the \"downtown\" location.  The service has been haphazard each time I've gone.  The waitstaff rushes around as if they are swamped even when they're just half full.  One trip we experienced a long wait for a table, though it looked like all that was required was to bus the table of some previously departed customers.  The food is a shadow of the meals I've had a the other locations.  Not a horrible version, but nothing that stands out from the myriad of mexican restaurants available here in Phoenix.  One trip we had a pitcher of blended margaritas, which tasted watery and bland.  So the next time we ordered individual margaritas, over rocks.  Unfortunately, they too were bland."}
{"text":"Fantastic. This food is very tasty and spicy. If you like Tex mex don't go here. This is New Mexican style food spicy and full of flavor. Plan on drinking a lot of beverages to wash the spice away."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place great food good margaritas!! We always come here but it seems to be the lady who seems to be the MANAGER? Dis likes us not to sure if it's because we are a younger couple? Not sure what it is we are a easy table to take care of we know what we want from the menu we share a medium margarita and that's it.. today we ate there she treated us like shit and we watched her at other tables and she was very polite to multiple tables and they messed up on my girlfriends order and that made it as if it was our fault!! We always tip 25%+ we know how it is to serve for a living... I think if she would treat all of her guest equally she would have a line out the door every night like la ristra!!"}
{"text":"so we went to the original one in PHOENIX!!!!!!!!!!! OMG!! it was so great and 100% opposite of ahwatukee's!! great service, great atmosphere, great FOOD oh- and NO country music =-) !!!! i ordered the carnitas (DELISH) the bf ordered some rib dish of some sort- i dont really know because my face was eating and LOVING my own dish.  i was MUCH happier here!!! GO!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited early this week for lunch.  The decor was charming and inviting.  They serve you chips and two salsa bowls.  One green and one red.  I love spicy food but the red salsa tasted terrible to me.  The green, however, was very good.  He husband ordered enchiladas with the fried egg of top, he said it was very good.  He cleaned his plate.  I had a taco salad, and that was pretty good too.  If you order the queso cheese dip, don't expect it to taste like queso.  We thought it was nasty and smelled soured, didn't finish it after two bites."}
{"text":"A close second on my list of favorite Mexican food restaurants of all time.  I had the green chili (or was it the red?) and it was spicy and filling.  My margarita was huge and no skimping on tequila occurred.   All that food for a low price - it's no wonder this place is consistently voted one of the best in the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"This place is as Guy would say \"Out of BOUNDS!\" good! I could eat at this joint every day until the day I die. If you like traditional meals and salsa that is actually spicy, this is the place.   Customer service means something to this establishment. You'll be treated as well (if not better) than you treat them. Smile and thank them and they'll jump for you!   Best plate in my opinion is the Carnitas. It's always juicy and the beans and rice never miss. I've had just about everything on their menu and nothing made me want to send it back.  Margaritas? Yup! And they do them by the pitcher if you want!! This place is a win!"}
{"text":"I live a minute from this place but had never been. . Decided to give a try for my birthday and will never return. First of all we sat on the patio be cuae there were no tables inside. Wasn't a big deal but after 15 mins we still had not seen our server. Finally we called the manager over who took our drink orders and sent over a waiter. Finally ordered our food but never got our drinks. After another 20 mins the waiter came to check on us and when we told him we never got our drinks. We had to tell him what we ordered. At this point I was not willing to wait any longer and decided to go somewhere else.   For the price of the dishes I would expect better service."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now.  I'll keep this review short because I need to go back a third time for some serious, honest-to-god research, but here's the jist of it:  The food here is great. The service is pretty average. The margaritas are completely, totally, unexplainably bad.  Like, 'this must be a joke' bad.  And I'm not talking about one margarita during one visit.  I'm talking about 5 different types of margaritas over 2 visits.  And usually after 2 margaritas, I'm not that picky!  So stop in if you want some mexican food, and maybe a beer.  Do not order a margarita until I figure out what is wrong with this place, and if they have a palatable option.  I will report back."}
{"text":"2-27-2015 Absolutely wonderful; friendly staff. Cheese crisp best appetizer, garlic pork roast dinner, Hot n spicy just like the old days (20+ years ago). Top shelf margaritas great. Need a little quicker service when ask for added items. Glad to know you've worked out some kinks others mentioned. Keep working on improving service. We'll be back!  Our food was too spicy for light weights, but hope they can offer \"cooler\" spice foods"}
{"text":"My Tia recommended Los Dos to me; she's the best cook I know so I felt obligated to check it out.  While the location can scare off some, I have never had a problem and it has always been worth it.  I must say, Los Dos is not for the wary as you will experience VERY spicy food, be overwhelmed by ceiling decorations and bright colors, and possibly deal with a wait.  Their motto is \"Some like it hot\" and its no joke; if you don't mind sweating and sniffling then this is the place to go!  I consider myself quite the critic when it comes to Mexican food, and I have to say, the rice and beans are excellent, great flavors, homemade tortillas, hot salsas, a great chile relleno, and good service.  If I were to nitpick, my complaints would be the sangria and seat comfortability.  All in all, this is authentic Mexican and a great local favorite."}
{"text":"So-so food, bad service and great margaritas. It seems to me that the quality of the food and the customer service at this palce gets worse and worse every time I go there. We went on a Saturday at around 1pm, 4 people in our party.  The place was not busy.  We walked in and it took at least 3-5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us and showed us to our table.  Workers would walk by the door and saw us standing there, but no one even said \"we'll be right with you\" or anything! Once seated, the water and chips arrived right away...the guy who sat us down never told us he was not our actual server, so we sat there for about 10-15 minutes and he never came back to take our order.  Finally, I called him over to our table and told him we were ready to order, and VERY rudely, he said, \"oh, she will take your order...WHEN SHE GETS A CHANCE!\", pointing to one of the waitresses.  She came by to take our order a few minutes later.  The food was OK, but it used to be better.  They use pre-made taco shells for their tacos...seriously?!  So much for authentic Mexican Food.  The only thing I really enjoyed during this last visit was the margaritas...those continue to be delicious :-)"}
{"text":"I love the salsa!!!  We ventured down here a few weeks ago for dinner...unfortunately they didn't have fish tacos...but the food was fantastic! When we arrived, we looked over the decor. It was refreshing to eat in a 'free standing' location and not part of a strip mall. As we went to enter, the ladies in front of us stopped because they were doing a birthday celebration for one of the tables - if you want to embarrass the birthday person - Take them here! They do a ceremony where all the employees sing and they create a fire with sugar in a bowl. There was a wait, but it was short. I had the 'Los Dos\" Flautas Dinner with one chicken and one shredded beef.  I thought the flautas were great. Dave had the Carnitas, and I did have a little taste and they were good too! I was also very pleased the service, very attentive and helpful. Why only four stars? They overcharged us for a flour tortilla, and once again I wish the rice and beans were better.   Overall - great food with a great experience. The table next to us was eating the ribs and chili - we are definitely going back to try those!"}
{"text":"I grew up in New Mexico so I was pretty excited when I discovered Los Dos.  Thier red and green chile is imported from Hatch and its AWESOME.  Definetly the best New Mexican food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding - best in Phoenix!! Unfortunately the service is less then desirable. We waited 15 min to get water and chips, another 15 min for our margaritas. Had to ask several times for water refills. Never saw server again.. once again, waited forever for check. Wish the service was half as good as the food.  5 star for food"}
{"text":"Best Chimi I've had anywhere in the Valley in forty years!  Ordered the Carne Adovada (Pork) topped with Green Chili, guacamole & sour cream, and a side of rice and beans.  Total flavor explosion!  Margaritas are reasonably priced as well.  Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Wonk - wonk - wonk... Don't come to this restaurant if you are hungry apparently.  After waiting over an hour for food our appetizers came at the same time as MY meal.  My husbands dinner NEVER ARRIVED!!! Luckily it wasn't on the bill.  I asked for mine to be put in a to go box so we could go home and make him something.  My soup was put in a styrofoam container which meant that soup leaked out all over my car, it stunk like bad food for a few days.  If you have to go there either eat ahead of time or skip it and go to Secretos across the street.  Better drinks and service."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was horrible. The waitress was annoyed and short with us. She took our order & never came back by once. We won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"The salsa was hot. The drink strong but good. The waiter was fabulous. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love the adovada enchiladas - get 'em with the egg on top! My kids practically grew up here, little Los Dos fans from day one."}
{"text":"Pros: Green Chili, Adovada, New Mexican, margaritas, salsa, bar seating.  Cons: Flex service can slow when busy, inconsistent hours/open times.  Los Dos is a great spot for spicy New Mexican food.  Keep in mind that New Mexican is different than Mexican - spicy with green chili either highlighting or supporting many dishes.  The flavor profile is similar, but not the same, which seems to throw off some of the reviews for this spot.  The food is excellent, and certainly representative of New Mexico.  Parking is pretty easy to negotiate, located behind the building via a narrow drive to the east side of the building.    When its really busy, service can be patchy - it seems they operate with minimal front staff.  You'll likely have different servers and runners stopping by throughout the course of your meal to check on you, if you need something, flag any of them instead of waiting for the person that took your order.  I doubt they assign specific servers to specific sections.  Also, I drove there several days after a holiday and they were closed, which was pretty annoying.  Their hours have been inconsistent for me in the past, sometimes closing early, or not open, and so on.  Overall, the food is excellent and a must-try in the area.  The food gets 5 stars.  The restaurant may be closed when you stop by, and the service may go either way, but its still worth a try."}
{"text":"Clean, coolly dark in the middle of the day, friendly, cheap, quick, well-spiced, generous in size of drinks and portions of excellent food.  That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Hot, spicy and to die for.  My favorite Mexican Food Restaurant period."}
{"text":"If hot, authentic Mexican food is your thing, you've come to the right place! I take everyone here for the true Phoenix experience. If you are looking for a fancy foo foo type place to impress your date, this isn't it. Dirty cushions, spotty glasses, sometimes inattentive service... But the FOOD! Nuf said."}
{"text":"Three stars for this place is a travesty. The food here is pretty good and the service is always friendly. Those are my main criteria for a five star rating. I also did not find anything I ordered nor either salsa too hot. Yes the food has kick to it, but it's far from what people have described.    i have to agree, however, I'm not too keen on the iPad billing system as it seems to cause mild chaos if you want to split the bill, and having the server watch you as you choose the tip is a bit off-putting."}
{"text":"So unfortunately the service was really slow and the salsa was way to hot. We filled up on chips and that was the best decision we made cause the food didn't look appealing and had no flavor. The rice was crunchy and the tacos were soggy. Should have went to taco bell (it probably would have been better)."}
{"text":"I have been going to Los Dos for the last 20-some years and I have only ever ordered one thing on the menu - the number 6 combination Machaca Burro. This is New Mexico cuisine and it is hot and tasty. A lot of people are turned off by the heat - so if you don't like hot, stay away.  NOTE: Their salsa is hands-down the best salsa I have ever experienced in a restaurant.  Any time I'm asked for a recommendation to a Mexican restaurant, this is the place I recommend. I have never had any customer service issues and the food has always been consistent in flavor. Now - keep in mind, I've only had one thing off their menu. Why, you might ask? Because when you have something that good , you can't imagine risking anything else.   Los Dos Molinos - Go get some."}
{"text":"OKay here is my second review and of course it is of Mexican Food of course. Phoenix has so many great Mexican food Places. I love New Mexican style food and so when I was told of this place I looked on yelp and found mixed reviews. But if you like Hatch Chiles then this is the place for you. If you don't like HOTTT food then you can still eat here and get great authentic New Mexican Food but ask the server for recommendations that are not hot. The House Margaritas are very good and a necessity if you want to keep cool. You have to try it, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Carne Avavado or Machaca. You can't go wrong with either dish.   Also, this was hands down some of the best service I've ever had....anywhere. no B.S. Next time I'm in the Phoenix/Mesa region, I'm making sure this place is on my agenda."}
{"text":"Food is good and there are different levels of hot. Work loves this place and use it regularly. Service is always right there for us."}
{"text":"We are from out of state looking for authentic Mexican cuisine. This is it! Fantastic food and margaritas. The salsa was so good. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is like Disneyland for your soul! Not only is the food amazing but the owner came out and treated us like her kids which was such an awesome dining experience! It truly felt like being at your aunts house and being doted on. Thanks so much for this awesome place! They won't be able to get rid of us now."}
{"text":"This place doesn't have the same feel as it did before it became Los Dos Molinos. Before, it was our go to place with friends for happy hour and dinner. With that said....  We wanted to like this place and visited a few times, however, in our opinion the quality of the food, drinks, and service went down. We ordered a cheese dip appetizer, it taste like it was from a can and microwaved. We weren't impressed with our dishes, the server wasn't good or attentive. We are all for supporting our local businesses, but unfortunately this place isn't for us."}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos is THE BEST Mexican food in town; hands down!  I'm an AZ native so I've tried pretty much everything over the years, but they stand out for achieving a level of flavor and spice that's hard to find.  The ribs and pork roast are outstanding as are their margaritas and sangrias (very tasty but very powerful so be careful).   :)"}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch and the atmosphere was very nice.  The staff was great and very accommodating.  They were patient, because we kept talking, but we finally did order.  I had a taco salad with chicken.  The size was just right as it came in a taco shell.  I am used to having lots of beans, and there weren't really that much, the chicken was a little sparse too, what chicken I had, was just on top of the salad.  The salad was good, but I wish there would have been more chicken.  It came with sour cream and salsa, which I used as a dressing. I would go back again, but would try something else"}
{"text":"Tastey.  Unique New Mexico style with chiles and not afraid to actually make food spicey."}
{"text":"Not a good Mexican food restaurant. The food is not good and the service is terrible. If your looking for a good Mexican restaurant then el comedor Guadalajara is the place to go."}
{"text":"Was visiting Phoenix and looking for a local place to enjoy drinks and dinner with my BFF. We don't like tourist traps. Our driver told us about Los Dos Molinos. Best! Had Spicy Bloody Mary, Queso dip and Garlic Shrimp. YUM. Oh and the salsa was good and spicy, right up my alley. Her frozen Margarita and Los Dos Flautas were great. Best bloody mary I've ever had. Cool vibe and staff was nice, attentive and made great suggestions. Mikey was a great host. While in town we will go back again to try more..."}
{"text":"The worst service ever!  There tables available but make us wait for over 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"Let me just say I was highly disappointed.  3:00 on a Friday (no Happy Hour btw) and the place was empty besides two strange people practically doing it in the bar.  The waiter/bartender, WOW.  He's one of those guys who looks like he just rolled out of bed, superficially overly-nice but really doesn't give a crap.  After seating us, he decided it would be a good time to bus some tables instead of getting us a drink.  Then he decided it would be a good idea to mess around with the television, again, BEFORE asking us if we wanted a drink or even water. Finally we got a Corona with an old lime and ordered. We asked for a side of sour cream to go with the HOT salsa that they are so proud of, BEFORE our late lunch arrival.  He takes our order and poof, disappears for about ten minutes (I suspect he might have also been the cook) He comes sauntering out with our plates in a snap and exclaims \"Oh, isn't this plate beautiful?!?\" and then gives us the side of sour cream that was supposed to come out first. My girlfriend had a bean burrito enchilada style and said it was pretty good, I have one more good thing to say before I shred this place to bits.  The sour cream is the star of everything.  It really is wonderful.  I don't know what they do to it (probably piss in it) but it is tasty.  I had the most god-aweful taco salad (ground beef).  Not only was the plating lacking, so was the lettuce and vegetables, practically non-existent.  The meat was very salty and that's all you get on a little pile of pinto beans. Disgusting. DO NOT SUPPORT OVER-RATED PLACES WHO DO NOT GIVE A #$%^! !"}
{"text":"Fantastic.. This is a great place to get some tasty Mexican food and margaritas. The Prickly Pear Margarita is wonderful, but you have to have a sweet tooth for it, however, their regular lime margaritas are some of the best in town.   The Motto of the restaurant is \"Some like it hot\" and for the most part, you do need to like spicy food to eat here. There are menu items that are low on the spicy side, however the salsas are usually pretty hot. When I say \"usually\" it means that it isn't always very spicy and this when people can be disappointed in the restaurant. Everything is homemade and made by scratch, which is a good thing but doesn't mean everything is going to be the same. The chili's that they use to make the salsa and sauces etc, are spicy depending on the season. (Just like in the store, you can only really get cherries at certain times). I've found the the summer season, esp. June is when Molinos is at its hottest (ate there a few days ago and had to down 3 huge glasses of water to make it through the meal).  In the winter months things are usually not very hot there.. But still tasty.   What I usually get is the Carne Adovada Chimichanga with green chili.. it is to die for, I've gotten it many times and I would have to say its one of the best chimichanga I have ever had. A couple of other items that are good is the blue corn enchiladas with green chill and the carne adovada platter is excellent.   The reason Molinos doesn't get five stars is because service can sometime be.. interesting. This one on Washington isn't very busy, however, it seems like there is really only one waiter taking care of the restaurant so it can take time to place orders, but food comes out quickly.   The Molinos on Central Ave, there are more servers but it ten times busier and when the servers/hostess gets stressed out they tend to take it out on the costumers.. I had called in to get a table of eight reserved, however, when I got there with five of us and the other three where in the parking lot. I asked for our table and the hostess looked at us and asked for the rest of our party. I  explained that they were on their way in. And she replied well they're not with you, we're giving your table away. My three other people walked in before she finished saying this and she refused to change her mind.   I would highly recommend going to the Molinos on Washington instead of Central.."}
{"text":"Love this place, especially their posole (red, with pork!). Most of the food is spicy, but it's all delicious!"}
{"text":"We went in with kind of high expectations since this place got such good reviews. My hubby and I were pretty disappointed. The music inside was very loud. Now, I'm not old but I do have some ear issues that makes it hard to hear people talk when there is a lot of background noise. If I'm in a booth, I'm good, otherwise...it sucks. So, we chose to sit outside. Mistake #1. My chair (Pick Up Stix chair to be specific...yes, a chair with another co logo on it) was crazy dirty. I was sooo glad I wore black pants. Like, I brushed it off with my hand and my hand was black. The table wobbled but I didn't want to sit at the concrete patio table so I leaned ever so slightly that we keep it balanced. Mistake #2 I ordered water w/lemon. Lemons took a while to actually show up. The water was awful. Like...really gross even with my 3 lemon wedges. And ice? Forget it. But, the waiter was very attentive to the margarita chuggin' lady at the table next to us. The chip guy came by and asked if we wanted more chips...we say yes please...he disappears with our bowl and it was never to be seen again.   Now... the food. The salsa was too spicy. The first couple of bites were good but then the temp set in and well, I couldn't taste much after that. I'm all for spicy but I think (like our table) there needs to be a balance of kick and just flat out burn your tastebuds off spicy. I ordered the shrimp tacos ($14.95). Hmmm... 4 pieces of shrimp. That was it and they were NOT even jumbo shrimp. And 1 tortilla. But I guess when you only have 4 small pieces of shrimp, you only need 1?  Some plain ol' pinto beans and then rice. The rice was ok, I actually make better mexican rice and I'm a white girl. My rice had some green sauce slathered all over it and some melted cheese. I was very disappointed because I'm a HUGE shrimp taco fan. My hubby ordred a beef dish, maybe it was a burro or something and the meat, like the salsa, was overly spicy.  Let me move on to the misters outside. At times it was nice, typical misting action. Other times, we were gorillas in the mist. Maybe that explains the adundance of dirt on my filthy Pick Up Stix chair??  Anyway, we won't go back. I guess maybe had I been chuggin' margaritas we would have recieved better service and maybe the food would have tasted better. Who knows..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I crave their food, salsa and margaritas. It's over an hour round trip from my house and I have been there 3 times this week alone. Try the shrimp Veracruz or garlic shrimp... Mmmmmmmmmmmmm. I ordered two extras shrimp Veracruz to-go after dinner just for myself. I do not know why or how someone could write a bad review: unless you don't like spicy... They do cook with authentic hatch chilies and it can be quite spicy. Read the story on the front of the menu then order: they cook everything from scratch.  Margaritas are one of kind and they use a better tequila and keep in mind this is not chain."}
{"text":"Good food.  A bit too salty.  Good margaritas.  Wouldn't consider it too New Mexican, but then again it's not really Sonoran either.  BTW, it's a chain, which is too bad, but also good as it's some of the best (overpriced) Mexican food available when you're in NYC.  From About.com:  Locations:  8646 S.

{"text":"I love this place.  The atmosphere is fun and casual. If you like spicy food, they have it covered.  There's also non spicy food for the less brave.  This is a great place to bring out of town guests, as there's no other place like Los Dos Molinos.  You have to experience it for yourself.  The kick-ass margaritas are amazing.  I personally, recommend the \"sangrita\" which is not on their menu.  Carlos makes the best sangritas.    Los Dos Molinos is family run.  They remember their customers and this personal touch only adds to the dining experience.  I look forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"As an Arizona native I was excited to try the Phoenix location on central; as I had already tried the Mesa location and was a bit underwhelmed. I was hoping that the Phoenix location would impress me and live up to the rumors I had heard.  The server was fast and reasonable polite, and after ordering two combo platters (beef burro and chicken burror) the food was out in under ten minutes.  This was surprising, as I expected a longer wait do to the self proclamation of all food made to order.  Unfortunately, this was the last pleasant experience here.         I would like to claim that the food was just ok, but in truth it was pretty awful. The chicken was dry and had a slightly rotten taste to it as if it been sitting around for a few days.  the beans were undercooked, crunchy in fact.  The rice was okay but it seems very dry and tasteless, even after dumping half of the salsa on top of it.  My father's beef burro faired none better as he referred to it as \"mushed up cat food\".        As an active man of large stature (6'4 240lbs), it is rare for me to leave a meal unfinished, but in this instance, I found myself abandoning the plate and retreating hungry and unhappy.  If this was a bargain priced restaurant I would be more understanding, but for 12 dollars I expect more than boiled chicken, undercooked beans, and tasteless rice.  Oh, and they unknowingly charge you $1 per small chip bowl which you find on your bill when you pay....for shame!  Save your time and visit one of the many glorious Mexican restaurants in the area, just not here.  But if you do, worry not on seeing me as I shall never return!"}
{"text":"Despite having expanded to multiple locations, Los Dos Molinos packs all of its original punch, and the food remains in the top echelon of Mexican restaurants in the U.S.  If you like it hot, you won't be disappointed, and the menu offers fare for more timid palates as well. The family tradition of food to savor carries on! The Adovado dishes and Chile Verde are favorites."}
{"text":"Beware of the wording on the menu. The tamale dinner gives you a choice of red beef, green chicken, green corn and blue corn tamales and says it comes with rice and beans and green or red chile. I ordered the red beef tamale and when I inquired about the green chili I was told since I ordered a red beef tamale that I got red chili. What? There was no chili on my plate. And the waitress was rude in addressing my polite inquiry. I gave two stars for the awesome spiciness of the food!!!"}
{"text":"Great spicy food that will knock your socks off!  I've been eating at the Alma School location for 20 years, and the food has never let me down.  Sometimes if the place is busy, the service might be a little slow, but that's true for most of the family-owned mexican places in town.    Plan ahead and deal with it and stop the whining!   Many of the critical reviews I've read either miss the point or don't understand what New Mexican food is about (the food is spicy and full of flavor, and if you can't handle the heat, blame yourself and not the restaurant).   Pinto beans are the norm, not refried beans, and they really don't need much seasoning.  The place is a landmark, and for good reason!"}
{"text":"Went w a large group for a buddy's B-Day on a Sat. night.  Service and food was great.  Place is a staple.  Yeah, it's hot food.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was our third time here and I feel like we finally did it right. I ordered the flauta plate (shredded beef) with black beans and rice. My husband had the relleno with adovada plate with pinto and rice. Both dishes were excellent. Both bean options were great! Also this time, we left the kids with a sitter so we could relax and enjoy the wait with the yummy chips and salsa (which were spicy but had great flavor). In the past, I sometimes found the food too spicy, but we loved these two dish and will definitely order again. Our waiter was also amazing and made great suggestions.  Great ambiance on the patio. 5 stars for this visit when it was averaging 3.5 stars in the past, so 4 stars for now.  UPDATE: after another amazing visit, I have to bump them to a full 5 stars. I got the beef flautas again with pinto beans... I will continue to get it over and over again. My husband got the adovada chimichanga, Christmas style. Both loved our dishes and have decided that the pinto is our favorite out of the two bean options. The special hibiscus marg was also delicious!"}
{"text":"I'd give a negative 5,000 for tonight's dinner rating if I could. I had no idea when we went out and paid for a meal that we weren't going to a restaurant, but rather to a frat party.   The table of 18 or so next to us were beyond drunk, and the margaritas were continuing to be served, but their food wasn't. It was so loud my husband and I had to yell at each other the entire time. Even when the party at the table next to us be can shouting \"chug, chug, chug\" at the top of their lungs and whistling, no one bothered to do anything about it.   the wait staff never checked in us, we only got the bill because I stopped the hostess to tell her she shouldn't have seated people at the other table in the room. Especially after the last people sitting there had been lucky enough to have gotten moved. She got the bill, we gave you no tip. We wont be back."}
{"text":"a valley staple for hardcore mexican food lovers.  everything is HOT.  even the rice is spicy.  you will need chapstick, deodorant, a hankie to wipe the sweat from your brow, and a full box of pepcid a-c or zantac.  be prepared to wait a long time during peak hours....but God it is worth it.  everything is incredibly flavorful and super spicy hot.  service is spotty...but who cares!   this is a supreme mexican food destination."}
{"text":"Terrific Mexican food.  Some restaurants frequently over cook Carnitas. This Carnitas was excellent! We even topped our meal off with a huge portion of sopapillas covered in Honey and brown sugar!"}
{"text":"First of all, it is New Mexican Cuisine, not Mexican, there is a HUGE difference.  If you are going to write a review, know what you are reviewing!  This basically means that the food is based around the Hatch chili being one of the prime ingredients.  It also means that is what you go there for.  It is hot or hotter depending on the crop.  If you order stuff that is not based on the hatch chili or the carne adovada, you are not getting it, just go eat at Taco bell and save the negative review.  Now that I have admonished the looky loos, the Carne Adovada is spectacular and there is none like it even in New Mexico.  The chilis are shipped over and they are very serious about how they prepare this dish.  I can say that I have eaten here and most of their locations for well over 20 years and have had nothing but fantastic food and VERY dangerous margaritas!  They have held this high standard consistently year after year, how many other business can say that?  Not many, if you want a cheese crisp with cheese and tortilla, they are fine, but what a waste of a trip!  If you do not like it hot, Taco Bell is a callin'!  :)"}
{"text":"Had time between appointments and needed lunch. As I drove by, I thought \"sounds good\", I like New Mexican cuisine. Great food. I had the Pork platter. Excellent. I enjoyed their green chili sauce. Very flavorful without burning my mouth. One of my best impulse stops in a long time."}
{"text":"If you like spicy, look no further!  Laid back atmosphere, good central location, margaritas (get top shelf vs house) and great Mexican food.  Have been coming here for years, they don't disapoint. Try the garlic pork roast with verde sauce....outstanding."}
{"text":"hot hot hot! their salsa is the hottest in phoenix, love it! they also have the best carnitas and a great tequila bar"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic !  Just moved here from Calif and have been missing our favorite Mexican restaurants . This place is New Mexico style food and we loved it ! You can't compare it to traditional Mexican cuisine . We plan on making regular visits .   Other reviews say that the service was terrible that was not the case when we went. Visited on a Sat night and was seated quickly.   The only suggestion would be better lighting outside. Hard to see from the street esp if you've never been there before"}
{"text":"Made a visit last night. Got a seat right when we walked in and service was excellent!! Love this place...if you like spicy food, you'll love the many spicy options!"}
{"text":"We recently debated if you'd come back to a place for good food but bad service or bad food and great service. Answer found here - service doesn't win out over bad food. Too salty. Ckn tacos were limp greasy tortillas filled with mashed bland chicken - looked like baby food. Rice dreadful. Chimichanga the size of a small enchilada. Do people really wait in line in so phx for this?  Too many good alternatives to come here twice.  And we're usually pretty forgiving..."}
{"text":"This place has the best New Mexican Mexican food outside of New Mexico. The Green Chille is the best. I had the chicken green chille burro, enchilada style, with Green Chilles. Have to like it hot, though. If not, the pork burro plain is wonderful."}
{"text":"Hello All.  I been eating Mexican Food  for many years In Arizona, Southern California and New Mexican.  I can say without exception that all the food served at Los Dos Molinos is authentic southwest flavored and extremely good!  Of PARTICULAR NOTE is that they are now serving, and I understand it will be a regular menu item, GRILLED (not fried) FISH TACOS.  Their Fish Tacos are literally the best you can find in Phoenix and believe me, I love grilled Fish Tacos and have been trying to find Mexican food restaurants in Phoenix that serve really good grilled Fish Tacos.  There are very few Restaurants in Phoenix that even serve grilled (not fried) Fish Tacos but none that you can find elsewhere that even compare with what Los Dos Molinos is currently serving.  I will also say the atmosphere is very nice and the service is very friendly and the best.  If you like really good Fish Tacos treat yourself and try them at Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"Relatively new visitor to Phoenix.  Found this place in Phoenix New Times paper. Drove a half hour from Tempe with teenage daughter, prospective ASU student on college visit.  Peak time, 8PM Sat. Night.  Wait--15 minutes. Waited in outside patio--folk art, kitsch, object's d'art, totally entertaining enviro. Finally, off to distant dining room. Kinda funky. Walls, windows not exactly immaculate.  Drinks, Chips, Salsa(s).  Chips, so-so. Both green and red salsas--fantastic.  Long wait for entrees, several Bohemias.  Entrees finally arrive.   Good God!   I get the Adovada (red chile sauce), my daughter gets the Green Chile Beef. Both dishes are mind-blowing. Flavors are bright, spicy, yes!, but full of flavor. This food is not for the Chile's crowd. Food is full of personality, the beans with the Adovada are nuts, flavors I can't quite put my finger on, and ridiculously spicy. My daughter's green chile sauce is sensational. None of this taste's like New Mexican food, it's quite something else. Absolutely delicious, assertive as hell, the least bashful food imaginable.  Only complaint....too much food. Brrrppp! Service was quasi-attentive, a little slow, but not annoying. Vibe was great."}
{"text":"Overrated. Overhyped  Yes, the food is \"hot and spicy\", but once you get past that one gimmick, this is a well below average restaurant.  If you request that the food be toned down on the level of spiciness, their response is \"that is the way the chef makes it - take it or leave it\".  I will gladly leave it."}
{"text":"True believer in the old saying, if you can't say anything nice then don't say anything at all ..... BUT I can't...I just can't do it. I even gave myself the 24 hour rule so I could be calm. We have been going to eat at Los Dos in Phoenix for well over 20 years so I know all about the spice and even the attitude sometimes because......it's Los Dos and it was worth it. People can over look really bad service if the food is awesome and try it again, which we have at this location...TWO SEPARATE TIMES!! Both occasions the service and food were terrible and it breaks my heart to write this. We had a friend visiting from out of state and even prepared our guest for what to expect. How embarrassing for us that standing in an almost EMPTY restaurant on a Saturday afternoon,to be ignored for 10 straight minutes to be seated,would be how we started our 2 hour lunch. I kept saying to our friend ...hang in there, the food is awesome after we sat unattended for another 15 minutes. Or ...sorry, I told you it was spicy and not have a drink for another 15 minutes. At this point, when we finally got served, I told my husband to order a pitcher of margaritas out of fear of never getting another chance to get a drink and our guest ordered 1 vodka soda, poor guy! Finally we order, we wait, no one to fill our water so we are drinking the water/melting ice from the margarita pitcher and here comes our lunch! I am so relieved that now he can see why it is so worth the horrible service AND......  it is terrible. I mean so bad that I wondered if they tried to make it that bad. The rice is so dry its crunchy, my sons meat in his burro is so old and charred he has to pick through to find something that isn't beef jerky, the burrito wasn't a burrito, it was more like a really poor attempt at an enchilada. No one ever checked on us, I had to shame someone to get us more water! Now I'm done apologizing, there is no way around this one.... 2 hours later, 1/2 eaten plates, empty glasses and a guy drops off our check and says.......get ready for it...... \"Sorry about the wait. Oh, hold on! I'm not sure I charged you for that vodka soda....oh wait, I did. Never mind\" and walks away.... My mouth fell to the floor!   We stood there ignored in an almost empty restaurant, sat there ignored while you waited on tables sat after us,ate your terrible food and never complained but you were about to take a check BACK for ONE vodka soda???  Our bill was close to $100 for 4 of us and I had to boycott the table vote on not leaving a tip.  Just don't bother, they don't care and it shows."}
{"text":"The food is good. But the service is horrible. They do not have assigned servers, so you end up with 5 different people coming by your table and asking you the same thing over and over. And then forgetting to take your order or bring your drinks because they think someone else already did it. Very confusing system. The other thing I hate is the tablets they make you use to pay for your meal instead of just giving you a check. The tablets force you to choose between 18% and 25% tip instead of letting you decide what to tip. The Chile Relleno my wife ordered was not very good. When I tried to let the waitress know that my wife and I were not completely happy with our experience she gave me bad attitude. Instead of apologizing or asking how it could be better, she just said \"That's how we are.\" and didn't seem to care one bit.  There are other Mexican restaurants in town with as good or better food than this place. And who have much better service. This was my first and last visit to Los Dos Molinos. I am never going back."}
{"text":"Date night & craving margaritas and something spicy...  Los dos to the rescue.  Well, almost!  We parked in back and walked through the patio- we were nicely seated and enjoyed the casual atmosphere.  The seating options are quite low budget and I felt gross for wearing a dress that didn't cover the back of my legs.  Dusty wire chairs with plastic covers or cement yard tables fill the Christmas light patio.  The \"kickass\" margarita was not the best- please tell me why no fresh lime???  $14 dollar drinks while perched on a dollar store seat?  The cup does not fool me.  The chip guy was on point and brought us more green salsa- which was our favorite.  I had a combination platter with a beef taco and red cheese enchilada.  The taco was not so great the meat was stringy but mushy- not shredded beef at all.  The enchilada was good with a spicy red sauce and homemade corn tortilla.   We continue to search for delicious Mexican food in a quality setting with a real lime margarita."}
{"text":"I'll keep this review short and sweet. Five stars for the food, I highly recommend the hand squeezed margarita and the tamale!!  Minus 2 stars for slow to no service & awkward table side \"check out\".  This has the potential to be a really great restaurant, they just need their staff to pull it together."}
{"text":"We came here after hearing so much about it. The food is excellent. Hot, but very good. If you can't handle spicy food, this is NOT the place for you. This restaurant features New Mexican style food with chiles from Hatch, NM. I had the Chimichanga with Carne Adovada (red chile pork stew) and my wife had the Garlic Roast Pork Burrito.  The flavors were magnificent and the food seemed so much more authentic. The cons? The service staff is below average. They realize they're in a popular place and people will still come. They could make so much more revenue if they just checked on customers after the food arrived. I would have loved a second margarita. This is not the restaurant's fault but my experience was ruined by some loud-mouthed, low-class drunks who raised the roof with their loud outbursts and laughter. Thanks jerks. Through all this, I do recommend Los Dos Molinos"}
{"text":"We visited here from Austin, Texas for spring training on the recommendation of a few locals who I trust very much.   Los Dos Molinos is the real deal. We experienced amazing food and great service. Over four days, we actually came here twice. This food isn't for the faint of heart -- like true New Mexican cuisine it has a little bit of a kick, but it's precise and intentional. We're looking forward to next year's spring training so we can hit up Los Dos Molinos a few more times."}
{"text":"Very authentic spicy Mexican food. I always hang out on this place whenever my Costa Rican friends hit the town. My thought of the their best food would be Adovada Ribs with added cheese. I also like Shrimp Veracruz and Enchiladas with either Green and Red cheese. Have been eating sumptuous Enchiladas before we're introduced with Adovada Ribs.  One thing to note though, the service is moderate, don't expect great service. Service can be iffy at times dependent on the mood of the boss-girl, and hence impacting the server's mood as well, but so far we've been lucky, a server told us sometimes it impacts the food as well.   Will be going there again (once my Costa Rican friend comes during their business visit)."}
{"text":"The food is spicy first of all!  Normal for Los Dos.  The service is (slow) not very good.  The place isn't as clean as I expect from a good restaurant.  The food is good, the green chili pork at $15 tastes great, but is over priced.  All the food here is priced high in my opinion.  Mexican lunch menu at that price doesn't make sense.    After all that:  I really like the receipts they serve (after all they are Los Dos).   I like the spice, so if you like the heat and don't mind the price, I'd say try it for yourself."}
{"text":"First you need to like spicy food!  Tex - Mex: Hatch chili spicy.  I have been here for lunch a couple of times - tried their burrito (green chili) $10 and the Green chili stew ($15).  The lunch menu is very pricy!  The place is cluttered, at least the bar area, but I think it was clean.  Bottom line:  If you like spicy food and don't mind spending 50% more than you should for a good meal; then I'd say try it.  The receipts are good, just over priced.  If you don't like spicy - don't come here."}
{"text":"It's spelled Chile if you are referring to NM chiles. Other than that my lunch was very good! I ordered the adovado enchiladas with red and green and a fried egg. The egg was perfect, the adovado was the most tender I've ever had and I've eaten plenty in NM. The chile was hot but still not like eating it in NM but I'm very particular about chile. The kids were happy with bean & cheese burros and a cheese crisp. The salsa was hot but too salty. Dos XXs on draft. Waitress was fine. Decor tried to be too NM while spelling chile as chili which was annoying. I have to say it was very pricey (IMO)  about $12 per plate kid's burro $6.95. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good but could be so much better! It was sad to see stale chips being served oh and by the way you can see why they're stale from the kitchen since they're kept in huge plastic bags.  Margaritas are too expensive considering that they use lemon juice that is not fresh. Lamb mole was delicious but it's the little things that make it seem like they do not care about the quality."}
{"text":"Most flavorful chimichanga I've ever had! the carne adovada and the green chilies were perfect. very spicy! even though I was stuffed, I couldn't stop eating the amazing food. the margaritas aren't cheap, but you can actually taste the tequila in them, unlike most Mexican food places I've been to. overall, great good and great service. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Woah, I wish I had the experience that the other reviewers had. The service was the worst I've seen in years! They started out by taking my drink order, and totally ignoring my boyfriend sitting across from me. When they came back with mine, he asked for a coke to which they never delivered. We would of asked again, but they never checked up on us. They only came three times, to take our order, to give us our food and to give us our check. Plus, they forgot my boyfriend's taco and tried charging us for it! When we went up to pay, we told her about our experience and all she could say was \"well, you should come back and get your taco.\" Um, no thanks, I think I'll stick with the Phoenix location. ;)"}
{"text":"If you're searching for authentic, spicy Mexican, look no further. We were hoping to find some local Mexican flavor, and this place had it.   I ordered the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. Know that the sauces are definitely hot. If you can't handle heat, get tacos. Anything with salsa will be spicy!  The enchiladas had a fried egg on top. My first time for that and it was delicious!  My coworker got the tamale dinner. He said the blue corn tamale was one of the best. The rice and beans aren't special, but you need the blandness to counterbalance the spice!  I also had a skinny margarita and it was perfect--and not light on the tequila.   I loved the atmosphere and the fact that it's still owned and run by the original family.   Great meal, and I'll come back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They serve authentic New Mexican cuisine. Great staff. Friendly and attentive. Reasonably priced meals with substantial portions. Comfortable ambiance. As someone diagnosed with Celiac Disease, they have an extensive gluten-free menu that is absolutely incredible. I've tried quite a few items but consistently find myself going back to the Adovada Burro (with gluten-free tortilla!). The tortilla is stuffed with perfectly spiced pork and beyond delicious. I usually wash it down with the medium Margarita which is served in a fish bowl. Yes, I said medium. Marisela and John always check on you to ensure your are satisfied with your meal. And don't get me started on the hot sauce."}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos was located near my hotel, so I drove there one night without knowing much about the restaurant. I love it when you are not particularly expecting anything and the food turns out to be quite delicious. I did not think the salsas to be that hot, as some had mentioned, but I like my food quite hot. The service was friendly and efficient. Very large serving and quite reasonable for what you get and I certainly enjoyed a couple of large margaritas."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service sucks. Had to ask repeatedly for refills of drinks and chips. Even when the waiter said he would bring the items, he \"forgot\" but then brought items we didn't ask for (extra sour cream) and still charged us for it. When it was brought to the manager's attention, the first thing out of her mouth was, \"Well, did you eat it?\" She was quite confrontational and seemed to have an attitude about requesting separate checks. I paid my bill, but she never returned with my change (I prefer to tip the waiter directly) and completely ignored us after we all paid our bills.  As I said, the food was delicious, but not so good that I would come back for more of the same bad service and bad behavior."}
{"text":"Rightly famous for hot, hot Mex. Yeah, I've seen cowboys cry."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night, hearing from someone that it has great authentic Mexican food AND seeing in New Times that they received Best Margarita in Phoenix 2011... Um, No. Yelpers are totally right when they say the service isn't very good. This location is very small and we waited at least an hour for the two of us. If the food was outstanding, then it wouldn't really matter, but that's a big if. The green corn tamale was so utterly spicey I couldn't even taste it. The beef taco was boring. It was a just a plain crispy taco shell like you'd get at Taco Bell! I expected a Filibertos style taco shell, mmm. Most importantly, and most disappointing, was the margarita! New Times was bought off to put this place as the best margarita in Phoenix. It totally sucked! Strong, but bad. I can think of four places off the top of my head with the best margaritas: Z Tejas, Sidebar, Four Peaks, and La Grande Orange Pizzaria. I give the place 2 stars cause the rice was good and for people who love spicey food, this place would probably be satisfying."}
{"text":"Last time we were in Phoenix we ate at the Mesa location (the Phoenix restaurant was closed) and loved it--  friendly people, fiery New Mexico style food, general good times. We vowed to visit the mothership on our next visit. Before heading out, I checked the yelp and got a little concerned; based on the reviews I worried our Phoenix Los Dos outing was going to involve one or more of the following: -rude staff -loud rooms -bad crowds -overpriced, gimmicky food that was supposed to be \"tex-mex\"  Still, our first Los Dos experience was so good (and the place came recommended by none other than R.W. Apple of the damned NYT) that we forged ahead.  All I can say is, I don't know where the heck all y'all folks have been eating, 'cause in my experience Los Dos has: -a bitchin' patio with lots of random seats/tables/furnishing/stuff -fun other patrons who are happy to be there and fun to be around -perfectly nice staff who are friendly, efficient, and considerate -excellent New Mexico style food, which we should note is NOT Mexican and NOT Tex-Mex. Nor is it supposed to be.  We enjoyed the cheese crisp, adovado ribs, shrimp veracruz, some margs and the massively hot salsa(w/chips). Everything was quite good-- the crisp was airy and flavorful, the shrimp well cooked (not over or under done) and tasty, and the salsa painful but also delightful. The star of the meal, however, was the order of ribs which were tender and infused with red chili flavor.  It's true that the food at Los Dos is hot as hell-- we were sweating a few bites in to our meal, and both of our appetites shut down sooner than they do under \"normal\" circumstances. I suppose this could get in the way of a particularly sensitive person enjoying the other flavors of the meal. That being said, the folks at Los Dos can cook, and if you can hang through the heat a visit to Los Dos is well worth the pain."}
{"text":"R.W. Apple, Jr., intrepid war correspondent and amazing foodie, recommended Los Dos in his book \"Apple's America.\" When Johnny Apple suggests one eat someplace I usually do, as before his death he had seen it all, ate it all, drank it all and knew the good stuff from the bad.  In recommending Los Dos Mr. Apple did not steer us wrong. The fiery, fiery mouthwatering food combined with excellent margaritas was one of the best meals I've had at a Mexican restaurant. It haunts me and ensures I'll be hauling myself to Mesa every time I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos - Home of the $20 itemized burrito.  The food is on par with any other Mexican joint but this place receives a single star because of the prices and rules.  You want guac, it'll cost you, you want sour cream, it'll cost you, you want anything besides meat and lettuce, it'll cost you.  One refill on the drinks, no splitting checks, cash only...I'd like to audit the books on this place."}
{"text":"Great food.  Large party impacted the service but the food and margaritas were great as usual"}
{"text":"I'll get the negatives out of the way. The service was on the slow side, and the waiter was inattentive. The drinks were good, but a little too expensive.  That being said, the food was amazing. We come from an area where there simply is not food like this, and we loved it. My girlfriend got the beef burro. She was warned of spice, but could have handled more. Still, the flavor was delicious. I got the adovada ribs. They were quite spicy with full-bodied flavor. The guacamole was simple, maybe only avocado and garlic, but so fresh, we devoured it. For Northerners craving good Southwestern food, this is worth the visit."}
{"text":"When we went to pay we wanted to split the check 50/50... They put EVERYTHING on my card and LOST my boyfriends card somewhere behind the bar!!!! We had to leave our table to go behind the bar to get it back! There was 5+ employees trying to find his credit card!!! Absolutely the worst restaurant I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"Having spent time in New Mexico visiting family, coming here for green chile is like being in NM itself. A little pricey, but amazing food."}
{"text":"Pulled pork carbonara was to die for, falling apart tender, wonderful flavor,  hand made tortillas.  Best i've ever had!"}
{"text":"Rude waitstaff who never smile, act put-out by having to do their job, & take ten minutes to fulfill your request(s) (after you remind them that you asked for something)."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, especially if you love hot green chile.everything cooked to order, so takes some time, but worth it. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! If you like it spicy hot this is the place for you. If you can drink liquid fire that is their salsa you will be very happy. Everything is homemade and great. Pour on their sauces and salsas and you have a party in your mouth and belly. Wash it down with an ice cold adult beverage and it is the perfect desert combination. I have been a fan of Los Dos for years and been to their locations. This looks to be a promising place for it to hold steady closer to the city masses."}
{"text":"Their slogan is So Like It Hot.... you get a pitcher of water with your chips and salsa... it's not as a joke. My recommendation is go easy on the salsa before you get your food otherwise you fry your mouth and miss out on some of the flavor. I've had the red chilli, the tamales, and both the ground beef and the shredded beef tacos. All were great. The margaritas are solid as well. Great place. The decor is old and dated but the food is top notch don't miss out! The salsa seems to very by the day. Some days the green is hotter and some days the red is hotter... either way go too hard and it won't matter anyhow cause your mouth will just be on fire.   Only real negative is they are closed on Mondays. Which of course you won't remember until you pull into the parking lot and wonder why it's empty."}
{"text":"I must have eaten here over a hundred times since the early 90's because the company I worked for at the time held gatherings with new managers here on a regular basis. Those were the years that this establishment won many awards for best of Phoenix and Zagot. It seems as they are relying on their old reputation.   The food was cold and salty, the margaritas were just lime mix and the service was slow!   Too bad...it used to be a good place.  Not so much any more,  it is like they don't even try any more. Too many great Mexican restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Good food but portion size has gotten smaller over the years.  The carne adovada should have more pork on the plate for the price."}
{"text":"This is some crazy spicy food.  They use New Mexico Hatch chilies, which are no joke.  I order a full side each of sour cream and guacamole just to get through the meal.  If you enjoy spicy food, you must try this.  If you don't enjoy spicy food, I still think you should try it (just get the sour cream like I do).  There are some non-spicy items on the menu of course, but they look so much less interesting...  One of their specialties, and my personal favorite, is an enchilada with an egg on top.  I got it hoping the egg would alleviate some of the heat, and it didn't, but it turned out being darn good.  Beware: the spiciness induces a high intake of the house margarita.  During peak lunch hours, the restaurant can get pretty busy.  This means long wait times.  This also means more margaritas.  Service isn't top-shelf, but they do what they need to do.  I've had a hard time getting someone's attention if it's outside the requisite seating/ordering/serving milestones (that's how I learned to order the sour cream immediately...I just can't wait for that).  Finally, the tab can get kinda pricy.  Especially if you had lots of margaritas.  An average entree is about $15, which I feel is high for lunch.  I enjoy going, but I won't do it often... it's just not *quite* worth the bill."}
{"text":"Now if you like Mexican food and you prefer it HOT, I mean seriously HOT, Five Alarm HOT, then my friend Los Dos Molinos in the answer to your prayers.   The food is wonderful, with combinations you'll find nowhere else. But seriously, did I mention it's hot? Oh and by the way, at Los Dos Molinos the green salsa is the HOT one not the red.  No light-weight type meals here, and on their whole menu I think there are only 2 or 3 items not marked as HOT. But it is amazing how well you can deal with the pain when the food is so incredible.  The place is a dive by any standards but well worth the trip. Try the Mexican Pizza, I dare you. Yes it's hot and yes it may take a while for your tastebuds to recover, but you will be addicted from the first bite!"}
{"text":"My review consists only of their business operating hours.. Because it's so god damn random I never get to eat here!!  In the last three times I've been excited about Los Dos, well it's closed.  One was a Saturday which is unexpected.. And today is Tuesday and what do you know; nobody is home.   I give up."}
{"text":"So awesome I had to go back for a second night!  The food is super, spicy, but not so spicy that you lose the full on flavor.  I can't wait to get back to Phoenix so I can go back."}
{"text":"Our family (extended) has been coming here since they opened this location.  I've moved to Kingman since but on my frequent returns to the Valley Los Dos Molinos is at the top of my \"places to go\" list  Both food and service are *****.  If there's a sixth star ever I'll revise my review  My favorite is the green enchiladas with fried egg.  Thanks for reading my review."}
{"text":"Fabulous food! Great staff! When the menu says spicy, it's no joke. First place I've found that actually has flavorful spicy! Seriously yum!!! We'll definitely go back!! Try the adovado ribs."}
{"text":"I've had the New Mexican plate here and didn't enjoy it at all!! Being from New Mexico we usually have ground beef in our enchiladas but it was my bad I should have asked. And most New Mexicans don't have eggs on there food which I asked the waitress not to add but still had it on there which was disappointing when I had to scrape all the gooey egg off my food. I don't really recommend this place that much ummm try Arribas I enjoy it."}
{"text":"Not as good as expected.  We drove further than normal for good Mex food to check out Los Dos Molinos and will not do so again.  The salsa is extremely hot and while flavorful, in the hot for hot sake category.  (I am no chili wimp often making up dove popper's with habanero)  The food was OK, but nothing special.  Easy to do better for the same $$ as others have said.  Margaritas were the bright spot as the premium fresh version at $20 is worth the money."}
{"text":"Good service, cold beer . But this is not New Mexican food, at least not from the part of New Mexico I am familiar with (Albuquerque /Santa Fe).Very very noisy."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Love this place.   My husband ordered the #1 combination plate (hard shell shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada with beans and rice) and I ordered the adovada pork. Both dishes were fantastic!  This establishment is not kidding when it states that they do not do mild. They use a chili from New Mexico that is HOT. Delicious and hot."}
{"text":"Adovado pork melts in your mouth. The rest is nothing special. I don't usually go there unless I'm with a group that insists on going because the wait is ridiculous and not worth it!"}
{"text":"If you like spice and flavor, this is your spot! We have been here many times, and bring all out of town friends who love Mexican food with flare. We really have no other restaurant to compare it to in the Chandler area. Did I mention the spice?! Everything is amazing. One friend travels around with his hot sauce and was so pleased with his green chili dish that he didn't need to add anything. If you want no spice, you can find that as well with the taco's or cheese crisp or a regular bean and cheese burrito. We actually had a friend from California visiting who said it was the best taco she has ever had. She is in her 70's mind you, and lived in Cali for her whole life. The staff is so nice and it has that family owned and run feeling. They take their time to make the food and stand by their quality. It is not a fancy restaurant but is clean and has consistently great food.  It is definitely New Mexican food with the menu having plenty of green and red chili dishes. We have had enchiladas, burros, chili relleno, tacos, carnitas, etc. and everything is amazing. Also a great happy hour and great all around prices. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The best food I've had in Mesa by FAR!!! Great service. You do have to wait for some really good food. Trust me, after trying their food, I deserved to wait even longer. The chips and salsa are very delicious. This is a great place to eat at if you love spicy food. I ordered the Carne Adovada Burro (Burrito) Enchillada Style. It was the so delicious! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"...what the others have said.....an echo...  On a recent sojourn to Phoenix, I overheard a colleague mention his favorite Mexican establishment to some others...and the word \"spicy\" was mentioned with reverance several times. So, being a devotee of the higher scofield numbers, I interjected myself into the otherwise private conversation.  One thing led to another....to my good fortune. [I was otherwise condemned to hotel fare.]  Everything was excellent...including the [multi flavored] ambience and it being hard to find. [The name of the place is merely painted on the top of the building in an industrial area...and illuminated with a couple of dim bulbs -- no figurative message intended.]  But....and this is enough of a \"but\" to zap the fifth star -- the table chips were seemingly out of a bag?!?!?!? HUH?! WHAT?!?!? That excellently spiced salsa [not for the faint of heart as others have noted] was wasted!! Why not homemade tortillas with some body....gloriously fried in lard like my favorite Mex-place in Pomona, CA??  That's my only quibble....when in the Phoenix area....GO! [They're motto is \"Some Like it Hot\"]  I give it a 300,000 plus on the Scofield scale!"}
{"text":"This place is fun, authentic, and pretty darn tasty.  We got the Chicken Tacos (hard shell is the way to go) and the Carnitas Plate.  Chicken taco was better than the carnitas, but both were yummy.    Dessert was a seasonal Apple Empanada - AMAZE!  As a native Arizonan, I am SUPER picky about my mexican food, but Los Dos won me over."}
{"text":"I used to regularly eat at the Los Dos Molinos in Mesa, this place is nothing like the original family owned place. The waiters were apathetic and the food was cold.  As someone else mentioned the margaritas tasted like cheap lemonade.  Our cheese crisp had no more than a tablespoon of cheese  We had a party of 6 (4adults/ 2 kids), when the $120 bill arrived they had added in the tip but had not indicated it, and had left open a spot to add in the tip.  Only when we asked for the itemized bill did we realize the tip had been added in.  Our out-of-town guests were extremely disappointed and as a long-time-ago regular of LDM I too was extremely disappointed. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Consistently fabulous! We live a few blocks away and this is a neighborhood staple. We bring all of our out-of-town guests here for dinner. The food is amazing and the service is even better.  A must if you're in south Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican food in the valley. Completely homemade, everything is perfection. Strong drinks, flavorful food and enough options to appease every palette. They take pride in their food, it can take a little time but anything that is this good needs a minute.  Don't waste your night out eating at another Mexican place."}
{"text":"If you do not beleive in love at first sight how about second chances?  With the Aunt and Uncle in town from Alaska I thought I should keep it real in new phoenix fashion by jumping on the lightrail to hit up some delicious Mexican food (both of which you can't ride or eat in AK).   Mind you this was right after this new spot opened.   We waited for almost an hour, were refused drinks from the bar, watched helplessly as tables were left uncleared and were finally shoved into a crappy high top.  I don't think my familia was too impressed.  I wouldn't  have visited that location again if there wasn't so many advocates at  my workplace.  In my half a dozen wonderful lunch visits since then, they have delivered the fire!  The service and food (especially the Enchilada dinner for lunch) is unbeaten and food is definitely comparable to its mother resteruant on South Central Ave.  So if you like it hot, delicious and real I would highly reccomend this great light rail ride lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Los Dos since they had the little restaurant on Main and Alma School. There is no better New Mexican style anywhere. My favorite, especially when I have a cold (or it IS cold), is the green chile stew. Un-believ-ably good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time more than 20 years ago. First time back and it is still serving up amazing New Mexican food. This restaurant has a staff that is passionate about great service and food that lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food, the service was solid and the food tasted fresh. Good place to get your Mexican fix."}
{"text":"Love the food, and signature margaritas. Been a Los Dos fan for decades. This is now our favorite location. Heck, just writing about it made me hungry. Looks like we're going to Los Dos for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Quick update. I've been coming here at least once a month for the past 6 months.   Quality and consistancy are amazing. The adovada is heavenly and seriously addictive.  See original review for thoughts on spice level. :)"}
{"text":"We came to this place on a recommendation from a local, since we're from out of town and were in the mood for some mexican fare. The food was good, I ordered the garlic shrimp which was a house specialty and it was slightly spicy. This place is supposed to be known for spicy food and their salsas are quite spicy. I love spicy food so the hotter, the better. The garlic shrimp was good, but i didn't feel like it was anything to write home about. I also tried the mojito which was also good. They strained the mint leaves out which is kind of nice. We also tried the guacamole which tasted fresh and wen well with the spicy food. The service was fast and prompt. The night we went the place wasn't really busy so it's not like we had to really compete for attention. The decor is casual although they did have a couple of random things on the wall...i think i saw a coyote pelt hanging on the wall but the place is casual so i wasn't bothered by it. Overall it's got decent mexican food at standard prices."}
{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE their adovado ribs! My husband and I have been going here for years. Love their new location. Much nicer patio area. I read on one of the reviews here that they use pre-made margarita mix, which is funny; I happen to love their margaritas.  Why not a 5-star rating, you ask, if I love so much about this restaurant. Their service is sometimes great, sometimes good, and sometimes a bit below average. Service isn't their strongest suit but since I go for the hot, spicy food, I consistently forgive their occasional inattentiveness:-)"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic New Mexican food, the sopapillas just need to be a bit lighter with more honey. Spicy Hatch green chili sauce and great margaritas too. So glad my search for good New Mexican food is over!"}
{"text":"I thought it was pretty good - I wished that I had known that the chicken was light and dark meat - I would've chosen something different, had I known...."}
{"text":"Los Dos used to be one of my favorites New Mexican restaurants years ago.  The Chandler location opened up recently and I was very excited since it was close to where I work.    Here's the short: Poor service, food was WAY too salty.    I was greeted as I was coming into the restaurant with who was to be my server flying out the front door.  Almost hit me in the head with the door. Once we were seated I noticed the menu was labeled as \"Temporary\".  Not sure what that meant. Anyway, I asked if the meat in the burrito was chunks of pork or shredded.  the answer I got was \"Shredded chunks of pork\", and after a closer look I noticed pork was not even an option. After several more questions it was obvious the server (who I think was a manager, wasn't dressed like a server) didn't know the menu at all, so I just ordered what my girlfriend ordered.  The food came out hot and in an acceptable amount of time, but after the first bite I noticed the extreme saltiness. Everything was really salty.  Main dish, beans and even the rice. I couldn't eat even half my plate before I went back to the chips. When asked if I wanted a to-go box I kindly declined.  We sat at the table with napkins over our half eaten plates for at least 15 minutes before she came back and cleared the plates.  Another 15 minutes passed before I had to ask another server for our check.  The most obnoxious part of this experience was when I paid. They use a modified iPad to electronically sign and fill in the tip.  I thought that was cool until the server stood over my should as I am about to fill in the tip.  Well, I wasn't planing to tip so I just signed it.  The server then pointed out quite clearly that I did not leave a tip and walked away. I thought we were done so we got up to leave.  As we were walking out the door she chased me down to give me my receipt and to point out once again that I didn't leave a tip.  Really? Take a hint lady!  Anyway, It became obvious to me that our visit ended in the same fashion it began; with that server/manager person running out the door after another customer walked out with leaving a tip.  If you like salt and poor service, this is your place."}
{"text":"The customer service is horrible which is too bad because the food is great. But button-line is I just can't ever go back, customer service is key to enjoying a meal."}
{"text":"After a company bbq and a few hours at the bar, a few of us decided to go to Los Dos Molinos for dinner and margaritas.  Honestly, I could have just gone home and passed out from fatigue.  Well actually, I did...I had left my phone at home the entire day, and decided to go get it in case I missed any calls.  Two phone calls and two text messages later, I woke up and made the short trek over (I had been promising them I'd go for several months now, and damn it, I was going to come through this time)!  I ordered the adovada ribs, which were pretty good and spicy, but also kinda salty.  Despite that, hunger took over and I wolfed a good portion of it down before packing the rest up in a to go box (in fact, it was just a styrofoam plate with a piece of foil).  The chips and red and green salsas were also pretty delicious and fiery.  I'm looking forward to my next trip out to Los Dos Molinos!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 20 years, the favors at this location are the original and the best. Spicy, layers of seasoning, just great food. Margaritas are legendary as well. New Mexico /Santa Fe cuisine in Arizona like no other. Looking forward to the next 20!"}
{"text":"Really love this place... the food is NEVER disappointing.  Some people say the food is hot, but I've been eating spicy food since I could walk so I'm not the person to ask about spicyness.  The margaritas are the best, try the prickly pear one!!!"}
{"text":"Sign on door (see photo) says family emergency, but was told by neighboring business (Philly's) employees that they locked the doors permanently today."}
{"text":"The food itself was very good. I'd ordered the flautas dinner, which was nice and crispy and very flavorful. But the downside was the service being EXTREMELY slow... it took about 15 minutes just to order drinks, another 20 to order our food. After that, it was an hour and a half until we finally ate. It's a good thing I wasn't there by myself, or I would've left long before the food arrived. The food was good but it wasn't necessarily worth the extensive wait, and we didn't see the same server twice -- it was always someone different coming to our table, so it almost seemed like they forgot about us. It'll be a while before we go back, and even then we won't need to be hungry when we get there since we'll be sitting around for a long time."}
{"text":"This was actually the worst service I've ever had in my entire life. The waiter sat us at a table that didn't even have silverware or placemats. I felt like I was being seated at an empty park table. Then it took him 20 minutes to get us water or even acknowledge our existence. After that I ordered a burrito but specifically asked for no cheese because I'm allergic. He gave me a rude look and of course my burrito came back SMOTHERED with cheese on top. After being too hungry to ask to send it back I picked around the cheese. After we were done eating we waited for the check for 45 minutes. I'm not kidding. we were so fed up that we went inside and our server was nowhere to be found. We had to go up to the bar to pay for the meal. At that point I was ready to walk out and not even pay but I am too decent of a person to do that.   Long story short this was the worst service I have ever experienced and I will not be coming back. Ever."}
{"text":"We love this place.  We first found Los Dos Molinos off of Central and Baseline.  When we moved to Ahwatukee, we were so excited to have a location within less than 1 mile from our house. family owned and operated.  Good service and food is excellent.  And let me tell you about the Margarita!!  You do not know the damage until you have finished the first round. A family favorite.  We are moving and are going to miss you!!!  Muchos Gracias for the memories Los Dos Molinos!!"}
{"text":"Talk about bringing back some spice to life. It had been a while since I've been. I forgot how good it was. I brought a large party and Drew and his staff took great care of us. The No. 1 is the way to go."}
{"text":"This place was voted Best Mexican food by Phoenix magazine??? THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE CARNE ASADA! What kind of Mexican restaurant is this? The service was horrible, the food spicy but mediocre and highly overpriced. I'm glad I ate there, so I know never to go back. You should try Los Picos Parrilla off of university and longmore, best Mexican restaurant in the east valley, hands down, i give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Always loved Los Dos but not so much this time.   Waited to be seated for 5 min for a table for 2 with many open tables available.    Seated for a while before our waiter came.  Food was average, not great, warm, not hot.    Also found it interesting that an 18% gratuity was added to our bill."}
{"text":"I drove a long way to try this place based on the reputation. It was in the middle of a rundown industrial setting, looking more like the back of a warehouse than the front of a restaurant. When I got there at 5pm on a Saturday, two carloads of would be customers were already there banging on the gates and windows in bewilderment that there was no one there and there was no note on the door explaining why they were closed and not serving dinner on a Saturday evening! I will not waste my time on this inconsiderate dive again."}
{"text":"Drove into Phoenix from San Diego and our friends insisted we try this place as it was \"authentic New Mexican\".  I'm game as I like that style of food. Mediocre interior with run of the mill seating. Everyone ordered something different expecting to share so we could all sample. Now don't confuse spicy with flavor. I'm a chile head as it were and wanted hot but never really got it from the salsas or the entrees. The easiest way to judge a Mexican restaurant is by it's chile relleno which I ordered. They should be made fresh to order and not pre made and come out wilted and greasy like this one was. Nothing even close to fresh with the minuscule single chile relleno that was dumped in front of me. And for the price I expected so much more. This happens when restaurants rest on their laurels and let quality slip.  From all the glaring reviews I guess there is really no accounting for taste."}
{"text":"My cousins and I eat out often and have eaten at Los Dos in many of the locations over the years so decided to go to the new one on Camelback.  Bad mistake.  Walk in the place is a din of noise.  We were seated promptly four of us, one menu.  Took forever for a waiter to return with , one more menu.  Finally the waiter returns took our order and service was pretty quick for the food to get to us.  I had posole which actually was tasty but would have been a lot better if it had been hot, it was just luke warm.  No time did our waiter ever return to fill ice tea glasses, and finally when we were  done he did return and fortunately did not ask how it was.  We had to ask twice for a carry home box.  The salsa of Los Dos is gone replaced by some gringo salsa.  The food is fair not great.  The service terrible.  Ambiance great.  Noise level high.  Worth trying again....nope.  Many people at different tables were complaining of getting no service.  I will await to see what moves in here because Los Dos is not long for this world at this location."}
{"text":"One of my worse experiences ever. From the silverware being dirty to a dry lemon for the beer it was just a terrible experience. From the get go half of the menu was eliminated as an option for being too spicy. The service was outstanding but the quality of the food does not merit a 20 dollar per person plate."}
{"text":"My first ( but not last ) visit to Los Dos Molinos was damned satisfying. It's a fair drive from where we are in North Phoenix but let me tell you: it is worth the trip. The area has character in abundance, as does the restaurant itself. Housed in an old hacienda, reportedly formerly the property of silent film star Tom Mix, there is spacious yet cozy patio area reached after winding you way from the front door through the dim and equally cozy restaurant. The patio feels like the place to spend most of your time when the weather is milder. Despite the mild annoyance of a few harmless bees investigating our margaritas, it was just a great spot.  We were immediately and pleasantly greeted by the staff and our waiter took the drink orders. We started with a pitcher of the house margarita, served in nicely large glasses, while checking out the menu and deciding what to eat. While deciding we, of course, enjoyed some chips and salsa. The salsa was your typical selection of red and green but definitely several cuts above average. Both had a good amount of fire to them, the red more so, without being overwhelming. For the meal I decided on the chimichanga combo, with chicken and green salsa. The serving was generous and really tasty. More than enough for a big guy like me. Having finished off our pitcher, T and I switched to the Sangria Margarita. These were seriously tasty. Served \"frozen\" they sport a nice, rich red color with hints of orange. Very flavorful.   The service was just great. Our server was fun, informative and just plain happy and pleasant. The young ladies who brought us our meals and more chips and salsa were outgoing and friendly. Overall, just a great experience.   Make it a point to stop in to Los Dos Molinos if you're venturing down Central, maybe to South Mountain. The decor is nicely eclectic and the whole vibe of the space is both intimate, cozy and cool. The patio area is a fine place to hang out with good friends and enjoy some drinks and some really fine Mexican fare. I know I'm going back."}
{"text":"If you like it spicy, this is the best Mexican food in town.  This is where you take out of town guests who say they like spicy Mexican food.    Whatever you get, ask them to put a fried egg on top, everything is better with an egg on top."}
{"text":"I'm in AZ on vacation, this was a great stop. Very home made: beans, tortillas. Love the green salsa. New Mexico cuisine. Very friendly."}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos has closed for business. Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"}
{"text":"Flying into town on business, this was my first stop before I even made it to the resort.  It came highly recommended by a local and it was delicious!    I had the Chimichanga, Adovada, Christmas-style.  I know that probably doesn't make any sense, but if you've read my reviews and you trust my opinion, do it.  It's a chimi stuffed with the most amazing meat, topped with both their famous red and green sauces.  Hot and spicy!  Yum!    Drinks.  Oh boy.  Big and refreshing.  I had what the referred to as a \"kick ass\" margarita.  My bestie had a sangria margarita and another friend had something with \"dog\" in the title.  It was a frozen margarita with a Corona in it.  I've been down that road before.  I decided to stick with the \"kick ass\" margs.  I had two...or was it three?"}
{"text":"We walked in and greeted in a friendly manner. the food I can't say never got that far my wife asked for a burrito and I asked for menudo but first I asked for a sample of the menudo to see if I would like it the server  said ok I'll get that for you ten minutes later I asked another server if he could get me a sample of the menudo he said ok then our first sever returned and said it would be about five or six minuets for that fifteen minutes for a sample I don't think so"}
{"text":"All of our meals were excellent. The service was really good. If you like new Mexican-style food this is an excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"I was a regular every Friday afternoon for lunch.  I went in on a Friday for Happy Hour and after sitting at the bar for 45 minutes I was told I had to move by the bartender.  When I asked why? The bartender told that 2 people that come in more than I do are going to take the seats we occupied.  When we moved to our new seats, I told the bartender that I thought that was rude.  I was then handed a bill and told that I did not need to come back.  I have brought numerous people into this establishment and spent almost every Friday there for lunch for about 6 months straight.  Sucks that I will not be going back because they have good food.  The service is terrible."}
{"text":"Finally, a Mexican restaurant that has flavor and spice! We have been very disappointed since moving from Houston, Tx to Surprise, Az, with the marginal so called Mexican restaurants available. Not so with this restaurant. Excellent food and service. We had the cheesy chorizo dip, not greasy, very highly seasoned. Had shrimp Veracruz and rellano plates. Everything was very tasty, good quality and plentiful portions.  Family run, very friendly restaurant.  A big thanks to a friend, Randy, for his suggestion.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Enchiladas were amazing.  Breathing fire but totally worth it.  Skinny margarita cools the flame."}
{"text":"I lived 40 years in Albuquerque and the pozole with green here rates with the best mom and pops at home (much as it hurts to admit it). Nice and spicy. Not crazy about the flour tortillas, though they are house made. Kahlua flan was great. Service excellent. I took off half a star because they spell chile with two \"i\"'s. I'll be back for the giant house margarita."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  But you're going to want to put your toilet paper in the freezer before you leave the house.  The mildest thing on the menu is really spicy.  And I love spicy foods, but this place is other level.  I have to dip every bite in the hot salsa, just to cool it down.     The margaritas are simply the best.  Best of any restaurant in Phoenix.    I eat at Los Dos often"}
{"text":"The food is nice and spicey and I liked the machaca. The service was good. The only thing is I found the food to be pretty darned salty. The salsa and the food was salty."}
{"text":"Great spicy Mexican food! I'm always looking for something other than standard options, and they have enough variety to keep it interesting. The jalapeno poppers are hand-breaded and stuffed with cream cheese, which is the best way to do it! They're closed on Sundays and have some weird hours, so I check yelp before wasting any more time driving up there only to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been blessed in my life to have been going to this restaurant since my mother was pregnant with me 26 years ago! I was lucky to have met Chef Cheryl when I was a little girl and she gave me a hair clip with chili peppers on it due to my love of the \"some like it hot\" spicy food. If you haven't already, you have to get the blue corn stack enchilada with green sauce and an egg on top for the ultimate delicious experience! Also, the sopapillas and margaritas are so yummy! I no longer live in Arizona but have had my family ship me salsa from Los Dos all the way to Florida to get my fix. If you haven't already come to LDM, you're missing out on great food and the wonderful owners and chefs who have kept the spicy dream alive!"}
{"text":"Excellent food - authentic New Mexico Mexican food. Always consistent and delicious. Service with a smile - the bartenders and wait staff are all friendly and attentive. Absolutely my favorite restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had combination #3, shredded beef taco and tostada. My boyfriend had the chimichanga in red sauce. We both enjoyed our food. I was expecting refried beans with my dinner, instead of whole beans and rice. I also expected horchata :(. Expectations and reality aside, food was good. Service not that great but we got to the restaurant at 8:30pm. Bottom line, We would go back, we really enjoyed the music and atmosphere. Tonight was a great fresh March night to sit in the patio and enjoy the ambiance!! This is a place that we'd take our friends and family."}
{"text":"Do you like spicy??  I LOVE spicy...and I can definitely get it here!!!  The food is really good, very flavorful and super spicy.  I love the restaurant's vibe too.  This is a place you will go to and then continue to crave on a regular basis...too bad it's soooooo far away.  Not too fond of the other location...just not as good."}
{"text":"VERY NICE HOT SAUCE, and decent food. Great service friendly staff. I LUV the hot stuff so this is 5 stars!!! A BIT ON THE PRICEY SIDE!!!"}
{"text":"If you want some spicy food in AZ. This is about as good as it gets. The server/bartender was great. Very funny guy and very quick. I enjoyed all of what I ate and was on the hot side compared to the Baja bland at most places. The price is not cheap and not a lot of seating so I understand wait lines at primetimes."}
{"text":"I've been to Los Dos Molinos a handful of times, but just to pick up to-go orders of their famous salsa.  I usually get a pint of both the red & the green - both are some of the best I've ever had and is reason alone to go.  The salsa is absolutely on the hot side but more than manageable if you enjoy heat.  I had my first dine-in experience with me, my wife, my 5 month old and my wife's parents (5 of us total).  The inside is fairly small and it was too hot to eat outside.  My father-in-law loves hot food and couldn't stop talking about how great it was.  My mother-in-law ordered some fresh guacamole to cool her palate.  The 4 of us each ordered something different and all of use really enjoyed our order.  Two things I'll mention: 1) the portions were huge and no one finished what they ordered 2) their reputation as \"the hottest food in phoenix\" didn't necessarily live up to the hype.  3 of us ordered a dish with the chile next to it.  The flavors were very good - just not hot.  Adding some of the hot salsa kicked up the spice.  Would recommend the food and especially the both salsas."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Hot, hot, hot.  Great family run New Mexican food joint with great margaritas too.  Be sure to ask for the \"Kick in the Ass.\""}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken taco salad with a fresh margarita. The food definitely did not disappoint! Very good and well prepared. The margarita was tasty as well. The best part is the atmosphere! The outside seating is definitely a favorite.   Will defiantly be coming back here! Especially with the beautiful night weather!"}
{"text":"My wife ordered food from uber eats and something got messed up on UBERs side and they delivered the wrong food.   The manager of LDM is literally driving the correct order to our house right now!  That's customer service!  Oh the food was pretty good too. Despite not being what we ordered. If you want good Mexican food and to be treated right go to Los Dos Molinos!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try since it had good reviews, though my experience was far from good. The waitress was extremely rude and didn't seem to care about providing any type of customer service. The food was not good at all and when I expressed to the them that I didn't like it they basically looked as if to say \"oh well\"  I will not be returning and would not recommend."}
{"text":"We love, love, love to eat here! It is so spicy and delicious. The service is great and the tequila selection is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Awesomely hot food!  You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"One house margarita and you're a goner.  Ribs and carnitas are uh-maze-ing."}
{"text":"We  love the food , most dishes are spicy but I am  wimp! There are some dishes that  aren't and still really good! My husband has been coming here for years ! We are fans!!!!"}
{"text":"YEA!! Finally a Los Dos in the Tukee!! Machaca Chimi is the best and it was even better than I remembered. The service has always been mediocre at all their restaurants but the food makes up for it. Can't wait to go back for happy hour and have one of those delicious margaritas!!"}
{"text":"I've been dining here since '95. Back then it was ALWAYS stellar. Lately though, it's been falling in quality and service. The owner left it to her daughter and sometimes we go and it's like the old days. sometimes we go and it's not. The Mom opened up the new location in Ahwatukee. Worth checking out and she's expanded the menu."}
{"text":"I like the idea of supporting a mom & pop restaurant, but these lunch prices r outrageous. Just a chicken burro with tomatoe, guacamole and green sauce was $16. The high price would have been okay if the taste was amazing. But, it did not taste good. It was one of the most bland burros I have ever had. And there's an old carpet smell when you first walk into the bar area. This place needs a good airing out, steam cleaning, price and menu update with tastier dishes."}
{"text":"First off, if you're coming here expecting a nice restaurant, don't bother, it's just another POS generic strip mall joint. Beyond that, I can't speak to the quality of the food because I wasn't ever able to try it. It doesn't matter how many hand scrawled signs you put on your front door advertising new hours, if your website and all your adverts say you're open till 9:00 people are going to expect you to be open till 9:00. If you want to close at the ridiculous hour of 6:00 PM then fine, but Maybe change your website first."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. Been coming to the these restaurants for a long time and don't get to visit as much that I live out of state.  Used to be SO good.  What happened Los Dos?  I have to agree with one of the reviewers who said this location is owned by a family member who just does not care or maybe just overwhelmed.  The food was mediocre!!!  That's the worst part.  The service was non-existent that we just had to laugh it off.  It was odd.  There are dead plants everywhere - and not in a good artsy way - more like sad, lacks pride, don't give a shit kind of way.  Will look for another location... I remember the Mesa one being excellent.  Will try it on my next visit."}
{"text":"Awesome Margarita's! Our very friendly server gave perfect recommendations. I ordered the chimichanga with the spicy shredded beef. Very good! The spicy cheesey dip was great too. We will make this a must-stop place every time we come to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Margaritas were weak, and expensive,  $8.50 for a house margarita during happy. Really? I don't think so.  The tamale and chicken enchiladas looked amazing,  but were super spicy.  The service was ok, not very attentive or friendly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite New Mexican place ever! I am a huge fan of Mexican and no place does it better. The food is spicy, so beware but that is also what makes it awesome! I binge chip at this place and drink the salsa, and I always ask for extra chips to bring back home for snacking (even better if I have leftover beans to bring back too). SO TASTY! SO SPICY. YEA!  A great place for lunch or dinner. The tamales are best! I like the chicken and the pork. For lunch I usually order off the a la carte menu and get a side of beans which is a lot of food for a lunch that ends up costing less than $10. If you are really hungry, go for the burrito...it's huge!  I can't stop thinking about their tamales. I am having one for lunch today."}
{"text":"Great New Mexico chili based dishes.  Fresh, tasty margarita's (try the spicy jalapeño, yum).  Friendly staff and great service..."}
{"text":"Location is nice and near other shopping so it's convenient enough. Atmosphere is is kind of vacant of life. The only employees who seemed happy were the bar tenders. A lot of brickabrack adorning the walls. We were surprised there could possibly be another location bc this one looked so thrown together and accumulated over a million years. Chips were thick salsa was so hot you can't taste it. The Verde had some nice flavor behind the fire. I even asked for a milder salsa, which I never do, I usually want the hot. However she never brought it. My stomach burned before my food came. Food options seemed boring. I always get a combo plate to test a place out. I ordered a beef hardshell taco and a chicken enchilada. I don't know if the food was also on fire or if my mouth was still from the salsa but it was difficult to finish my food.  The beans and rice were good. not spicy. My son (15 months) was able to eat them just fine. My stomach was burnin' before we even left and I'm no stranger to mexican or spicy food. Our server was sweet but seemed terrified (maybe she was new) My order was wrong and she didn't bring the salsa I requested but other wise she was just fine, nothing amazing. The bartender offered my some crayons and tried to interact with him which was nice. I have heard great things about this place but we didn't hit the bar scene or the patio so maybe thats where the magic happens. but as far as family dining and what my palette prefers, I wont go back. For the bill they brought is an iPad to sign off on that only have 18, 20 and 22% tip options...and the waitress stood there as we chose her tip...it was super tacky.  For perspective I prefer Garcias/Abuelos/Villa Luna for chain style and Los Tequitos for hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I think this place has really settled in since it opened. They have a set menu now that is smaller than the Mesa and Phoenix location, but I really have enjoyed everything I have had there.  The food is very spicy so be warned.  Even the salsa they give you is usually very very hot.   The two owners are usually working the restaurant during lunch and they have always greeted me and been very social and fun.  They seem to really like the place and want you to have a good time.  On the weekends make sure you call for reservations and you should have no problem with seating.  I took some friends there one friday night and I didn't get our servers name, but she was very entertaining and made the whole night a blast.  Things to try: - Guacamole ( A +++) - Chile Reno ( my favorite )"}
{"text":"Awesome meat. Most of my buddies got the ribs, which are wicked spicy. They were sweating! Their ribs are already off the bone so I guess that speaks to how tender they are. I like milder food and found the tender pork (carnitas) delicious! It was the rice that was spicy! Great food. Go there for birthdays! They have a great way to celebrate! Also Kick-ass margaritas are really kick ass! Pitchers all around!"}
{"text":"So we finaly got a chance to try Los Dos Molinos, and I was a bit disappointed. Now the service was fantastic and I did have the single best glass of sangria that i've ever had. It's housed in what used to be Padres, great location around 10th and Camelback.   I ordered the Carne adobada ribs with beans and rice and my wife got the posole. When I'm thinking ribs, I'm wanting a decent portion of meat on or off the bone. What I got was 2 very small pieces of pork that totaled probably less than one total pork rib, covered in sauce so spicy that you couldn't taste anything else on the plate. The beans were teh same way. They were simmered with the same burn your face off red chili, and pretty tough to get through. the rice was dry and it seemed bland (but I coudlnt' taste very much after eating the red sauce, so who knows). My wife ordered the posole with green chile and it too was too spicy for her to eat. After our mea, we had asked the server about the ability to put the chile on the side and said that was an option for next time..but I can't say there will be a next time. While I'm all for some good spicy food, don't burn my face off and call that tasty. I was really wanting to love this place but the food just fell flat for me."}
{"text":"I love the hot salsa green and red they both have their unique flavor, oh so good. All of the food is outstanding. I love the atmosphere and the warm friendly people."}
{"text":"The green chili stew is not as good as used to be when this restaurant was on Chandler Blvd. it now has to much filler, to many beans, to much corn and rice. The stew doesn't have heat it used to have. I'll be sticking to the Los Dos on Central or Alma School."}
{"text":"This is the best Nee Mexican restaurant in Mesa, hands down. If you like some heat in your Mexican dishes this is the best place to eat."}
{"text":"I don't know if they just had an off night, if I ordered the wrong thing (the \"red chili plate\"), or if their quality of food has deteriorated; but I was sorely disappointed during my last visit. I've always liked the atmosphere at the other \"Los Dos\" better, (I mean come on, the \"red chili plate\" is aka \"chile colorado\" at any other Mexican restaurant), but at least the food used to be good. This last time, the food was bland, the tortillas were greasy, I could have gotten better guacamole at Chipotle, and the poppers were store bought (yes, I know, dumb mistake- they just sounded good at the time). My recommendations: try the \"green chile plate\" (aka \"chile verde\" at any other Mexican restaurant). Try the other \"Los Dos\", the one off Central. Or maybe, try some other place."}
{"text":"I usually frequent the Chandler location these days since it's closer to my house. This particular location has a broader menu so it's more fun to take out of town friends.  Like the other locations most everything is extremely spicy.  Although they actually have a few things that are not  hot and the non-spice eaters I have taken thought it was really good without being firey like the rest of the menu.  So if you have squeamish friends pick this location.  The food is great and always tastes like it's just prepared with great tortillas. The service is a bit slow sometimes, but the the staff is always very nice and the food and margaritas never disappoint..   The salsa is extremely hot at all their locations so warn your friends when you go.  Try:  - Chili Renos - New Mexican Enchiladas - Adovada - Prickly Pear Margaritas"}
{"text":"Best mexican I've ever had. Got the pork roast burro with green chilis. No refried beans here, you get the good fresh pintos."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 10 times and I get the same thing every single time.  So take this review for what it is.... limited in scope.  The Margarita's are fantastic. I enjoy them.  The chips and salsa are good, and of course the salsa is HOT. The dish I love is the chicken enchiladas with a cooked egg on top. Not as good as Mi Nidito in Tucson, but still pretty darn good and worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. Ever.  If you like your food on the spicier side this place will make you very happy indeed. Love to get the Chicken or Carnitas Plate Christmas style with a house margarita on the rocks half sweet. So yum!!!! You can tase the love in the food. Complex and comfort food flavors all the way. This is my go to for \"Mexican\" food as there is no comparison in the Valley in my opinion. While I live in PHX the New Mexican style is my friend ;)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, and reasonable prices. The food is authentic Mexican and leans on the spicy side - everything we ate was delicious. We ordered the Chorizo Dip as an appetizer. It is served was deep fried flour tortilla chips and topped with cheese and cilantro. It is perfection - spicy, tasty and cheesy. I also had a bowl of posole - I opted for red chili with pork and it was very good. They have a cute patio that I can't wait to try when it cools off"}
{"text":"Who needs fancy, uppity places on Scottsdale Road when you have amazing hole in the wall type places like this?!  This place has it all....good food, ginormous drinks, warm atmosphere, and awesome service.    Four of us dined here for dinner the other night.  Our server was fantastic!  He was outgoing and personable.  He explained some of his favorite items on the menu and suggested some great drinks!  I had the sangria margarita and not only was it a pretty looking drink, but it was also yummy!  It was red sangria and had margarita swirled in it.  I wasn't a huge fan of the red salsa, but the green salsa was hot hot hot!  Their guacamole was also fresh.  For my entree, I went with the shredded beef flautas.  I thought it was a bit overcooked, but still good.  I wasn't complaining.  Everyone was satisfied with their entrees.    If you are looking for good Mexican food with great service, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Chips were stale and cold. Salsas were just spicy (red and green) and not very good. Ordered the cheese enchilada meal. Rice was old tasting, hard yet sticky. Enchilada was strange and was flat dough. 3 because it was just okay. I didn't puke....but I may when I think about it. Probably the worst restaurant I've ever been to. And it's expensive. How?  There are so many better places nearby. I'm no longer allowed to choose where to eat. Do NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"I literally dream of the enchilada dinner plate. Their spice game is on point, the owner, Drew, is absolutely the best and the bartender, Hector, is always friendly and awesome. Last time he recommended I try their sangria/margarita combo.. All I can say is yes, please and can I have another.   This place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Classy but a little spicy for me. Server was ok but the manager made sure everything was perfect. Even brought out some not so spicy salsa. The shrimp and green chile quesadilla was to die for, the jumbo shrimp did it for me!"}
{"text":"We have been twice and were extremely disappointed both times. The service was terrible, we sat for over 45 min before our food came and we regularly had to ask for service. Once the food finally came we were even more disappointed. It was barely warm and overly spicy. Would not recommend at all."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is spicy and delicious and the staff is really friendly. They have a few different locations which is nice depending on where you are at in the Valley!"}
{"text":"First time here. The employees were very down to earth and friendly. There was, some manger sir, how was very made me and my friend feel very at home. Food was ammmmazing I am very impressed and would recommend anyone here. I usually don't leave reviews but I felt like I needed too this time!"}
{"text":"Great food and service to be found at Los Dos Molinos.  Love spicy food and this place delivers.  Even \"mild\" has a kick to it.  Chase that down with some awesome margaritas and what could be better?  I recomend their adovada sauce.  Love anything they cook in that.  The relleno de carne adovada being my favorite choice.  Hot spicy goodness at it's finest!"}
{"text":"The best! Great atmosphere, great food. Really strong drinks LOL always a fun time at Los dos."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Good food. Giant Margaritas."}
{"text":"Most spicy food we ever try. But everything was tasty and delicious. Especially chimichanga with machaca and shrimps as well."}
{"text":"Really good Chimichanga and Grande Burro.  Really good prices  Far drive with no highways from Scottsdale :/"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time eating here & it's been consistently satisfying. The decor & atmosphere is very fun & loud! I don't have the best hearing so at a place like this I just know I'm going to have to ask people to repeat themselves. A close friend who now lives out of state likes to have get togethers here, hence the two times I've been, & they easily accommodate our large group. The food is big, cheesy & slightly spicy, which makes for an exciting meal! I will say it's not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it's still very good!"}
{"text":"My parents and I were looking for a place to eat, and I recommended this place because I'd been to their other location in Phoenix and loved it. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have been entirely successful in replicating the original. Though they've made a decent effort with the decor, the strip-mall setting is still a bit of a downer. Hostess and waiter were inattentive. The food was still good, but not on par with the original location. When my dad ordered blue corn tortillas (as listed on the menu), the waiter looked a bit surprised and said \"We haven't had those in, like, a year.\" Ha.  I hope to return to the Phoenix location many more times, but probably won't come back to this one - or risk recommending it again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and every visit has been fantastic. I love real New Mexican style food, and they do it really well here (if you don't like spicy, you probably won't appreciate this place as much as I do). Good service, great food, and pretty reasonable prices."}
{"text":"First impression... Walking up to the restaurant I was knocked back with an incredible aroma emanating from the patio/front door. You could tell that this place was cooking with some serious spices and flavor. My olfactory senses got turgid and my salivary glands prematurely evacuated themselves. I told myself I wouldn't let this happen again - I'm not even inside yet! Well, I peaked early and only once. I walked inside to some tacky décor and very average service. Cue rugs on the wall, and tequila bottle vases with fake flowers....  At first I found it humorous that the table was given a stack of plastic cups and a pitcher of ice water. Sure it's efficient but far from classy. The chips and salsa were lackluster in my opinion, while also being tongue crippling. Odd combo, right? All of those smells I encountered walking in - I was beginning to taste. There was a watery green tomatillo salsa and a dark red, obviously strongly roasted hot red salsa. Usually a fan of things spicy, I was amazed at how hot I found this to be. I imagined how many patrons would be put off by such a strong table salsa without request. Nonetheless I was confused by why my mouth was on fire but I wasn't finding an enjoyable delicious taste. Something didn't match up right. I don't know if my taste bros were too injured from the heat to notice to amazing flavor, or if it simply wasn't there. Some could argue that chips & salsa is the best litmus test of a Mexican restaurant. I decided to stave off judgment until food came. I was excited to try my entrée.   I ordered a #2 which was a chicken hard taco, a chicken and cheese enchilada + rice & beans. I instantly dove into the taco which was fantastic - truly one of the better and most simple tacos ever. The shell was thick and crunchy. It held together and provided a magnificent contrasting crunch and toasty flavor to the chicken which was definitely marinated and cooked nicely. All of the flavor came through and the marinade was warm but not overly hot. Off to a great start LDM! Beans and rice were good but not worth the trip. No bean choices were given and pinto were served. I realized quickly that this restaurant is a big fan of the Pinto bean. All plates on the table had some of these puppies perched somewhere or somehow. Not usually my bean of choice, but they were adequate. I recognized the dark roasted red color covering my enchilada. It was very similar to the table salsa that I already wasn't a massive fan of. I took a normal sized bite and after a few seconds delay quickly was requesting the pitcher of water be passed my way. I have no idea if there was really chicken or any other ingredients in the enchilada, because all I tasted was HOT. Same description as the chips and salsa: \"Something didn't match up right. I don't know if my taste bros were too injured from the heat to notice to amazing flavor, or if it simply wasn't there.\"  Margaritas were ordered by some at the table, but not by myself. They looked like they were simply Mix + Tequila. Nothing award winning or notable, and certainly not deserving of a $10 price tag. I had the pleasure of seeing them before placing my non-order. I would definitely have been disappointed if I had received one.   Stephanie D. already gave this place an incredibly accurate review - so I immediately trust her. I'll take her recommendations and when I re-visit I'll try out the Chile Relleno with Adovada or the Chile Plate with Machaca. As I said, I know this place is using some phenomenal flavors and I am determined to find what dishes highlight it best. LDM is one of the go-to restaurants for my friends in the 'Tuke so I'm sure to return."}
{"text":"The WORST service ever!  We showed up early on Thur night for dinner with some family and when we entered in, we literally waited over 10min to be acknowledged.  Add to that that when we did get acknowledged, it was by some guy that hurriedly told us that they were closing early (it was before 8 and they close at 9) that day and couldn't serve us.  *Are you kidding me??*  We were all really hungry and would hav never expected to be turned away that early for closing plans.  The door outside said 9, therefore you should stop allowing customers at 9, not an hour before - Truly disappointed and peeved.  Never going back!!"}
{"text":"Great food, our plates were empty. Very casual atmosphere, the service was on point. Will DEFINITELY go back"}
{"text":"Had a craving for breakfast burritos and this was close to Jon's home.  So yummy! Super ginormous burritos and the salsa bar was delish.  Bookmarked and will def go back!"}
{"text":"Food, Service, and drinks are all top notch. I love spicy food and Los Dos delivers. My wife doesn't like it as spicy and there are options for her...Flautas! You MUST have the Adobada Ribs if you love intense heat WITH flavor. Kick Ass Margerita is great but I opt for the house Margo with a shot of one of their hundred tequilas...Cuervo Tres Generations for me. Anyway, you can get in and out quickly or stay for hours, relax, and enjoy! Cheers to John & John and the staff!"}
{"text":"Ate here many times back when I worked in Mesa. The food was always killer, even the \" mild\" salsa is spicy! The make the best sangria I ever had."}
{"text":"Stopped by and had the green chili plate minus the cheese.  Good as always.  I have been going here for years and never had a bad meal.  Great place and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Very tasty food and quite spicy although I was a bit disappointed in the margaritas that I heard were excellent. They don't have mild sauces here so prepare to lick the salt and have the water handy. Although they say service is not good here I haven't had a problem and found the staff to be quite friendly and prompt. Tasty tacos just order something other than a marg to accompany your meal."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Not impressed. Took over 20 mins to get our food even though it wasn't busy at all. The food was so so. I wouldn't consider this authentic Mexican food at all. Zero flavor... everything has a weird taste to it. Salsa was hot, but with absolutely no flavor. Would not recommend!!"}
{"text":"Another great experience today. The crew is firing on all cylinders. Great service and and awesome food, we had a free cheese crisp with hatch chiles for checking in on yelp. My wife had chile relleno stuffed with adobada pork. I had the garlic roast pork. Everything was yummy and the home made tortillas are a treat. Both of the free salsas are great with the chips too. I have to come back sooner next time, thanks Los Dos!"}
{"text":"Thanks for another great meal! Awesome New Mex style, great heat and great drinks. Can't wait to come back. :-)"}
{"text":"Server was rude and unfriendly. Place wasn't very clean either. Don't go expecting them to be accommodating at all if you request their items to be made differently than as stated on menu. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos is a Phoenix legend for a reason!  Yes, the food is notoriously spicy. Yes, the service can be a bit slow on a packed Friday night. And yes, the restaurant is located in South Phoenix, which apparently scares the pants off of some people.  But the food and drinks are top notch. We usually come at lunchtime on Saturday and have never run into a long wait. Service with a smile, and both seating and food service are fast. Los Dos has the best carnitas in town, and the most potent margaritas. If you're lucky enough to go on a day when the green chili stew special is available, don't miss it!   Chef Victoria's amazing tamales are also available for the holidays. Which reminds me it's time to place my order."}
{"text":"Rating: Excellent   Greater was prompt and pleasant. Waiter was on top of everything and his recommendation was on point. Drinks where never low. Food was exceptional. Checked on by the manager. I really could not recommend one change to my experience. Really top notch.   And this during the lunch rush, where there was clearly several other large groups.   This will be on my heavy rotation list for sure."}
{"text":"Came for dinner and sat at the bar. Great, efficient service. Had the signature meat in a burrito and it was excellent. Amazing flavors with just the right amount of spice. I highly recommend it, plus you can get in a variety of ways. The green salsa that came with the chips was excellent as well. Used all of it.  I will be back, if you haven't tried this place do it."}
{"text":"Saturday night, no manager on duty. A staff that is forgetful, can't admit their own faults, and adds bogus charges to the bill. Nickle and dime you for everything, no free refills on anything, at all. Overpriced entrees and drinks. Bean staind table covers. Resulting in the worst mothers day dinner."}
{"text":"Went here to show them off to family and I was embarrassed at what kind of service they provide. I know that they are a family ran restaurant but they need to seriously rethink how the train their staff. They have the tools (iPad pos systems for the severs) yet they lack the simple service standards that anyone would expect from a restaurant with standards set in place. The server was flustered with 3 tables and forgot that we hadn't ordered yet even though our menus were closed and on the side of the table, this place needs someone who can implement rules and standards that will show their food justice. BOH...keep up the good work, FOH crew please get some more training on how to properly run a floor and serve tables."}
{"text":"Your search for quality spicy New Mexican food is over! I was greeted by a very friendly bartender that explained their kick ass margarita in a humorous way. I was then promptly served green hatch chile and red chile salsas with crispy tortilla chips.   Ordering was a no brainer as I went for the best looking and proclaimed house speciality, Adovado Ribs. Fall apart tender, spicy and flavorful with a fresh tortilla, beans and rice.   I grew up eating Mexican / TexMex in Fort Worth Texas and spent many years with this type of food in various towns and pueblos in New Mexico. I travel here often for business and have searched for many years in Phoenix area for that flavor which is only a state away. I am happy to say I finally found it.   Did I mention the service was top notch and the place was spotless? No? Well, it was and that's a big deal to me."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm originally from NM and love to treat myself to the real deal. So today I go right at 5pm when they reopen for Dinner.  Word to the wise go early before they get crazy busy.  I go all out and start with a medium Kick Ass Margarita. Very Good, but $14 good not so sure.  I wanted to go all out on food knowing I couldn't finish it all so I order Posole and Green Chile Chicken Casserole.  Small bowl of Posole with all broth and next to no hominy at $10.95, not a good deal. Green Chile Casserole was really good.  Mgr and server could be more genuine and act as though they appreciate your business more.  I was Dining Solo and dropped $50 with tip.  Very Good and they know it, but respect the majority a little more, just sayin."}
{"text":"I see a lot of negative reviews here based on the bad customer experience.  Maybe it's because I lived in Chicago, but this has never even crossed my mind, especially when confronted with the incredibleness that is the stacked enchiladas.  Take a step back, order a sangria, snack on some chips and prepare your mouth... no--your whole body for this.  The first bite of these stacked enchiladas (always order them with green chile, might I add) will knock your socks off.  Literally.  (Side note: if you see one of my socks...)  The place has gotten a bit too busy, but it's still well worth the wait.  Or, for those not content to drink sangria while waiting for a table, you can check out the Mesa one; I've never had to wait long there, but it just doesn't have the same character.  I look forward to visiting the suburban sprawl that is the Phoenix metro area each year, and this is in no small part because of this place.  Los Dos makes a mean, spicy, enchilada."}
{"text":"Still consistently stellar!  If you're in from out of town, I'm probably taking you here. Along with anything Adovada, add their Green Chili Stew.  Delicious"}
{"text":"Very good pollo and green chili burrito enchilada style...Yum!"}
{"text":"So excellent!  True to form authentic Mexican food with a lively, cool vibe to boot. Service and food are outstanding. Super spicy everything.....Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy New Mexican food, this is the place for you!  Great green chili. Margaritas are very good as well.  Look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Update from initial post and unfortunately a drop of a star. I still love the burro here, but my last attempt to eat it was thwarted by... the restaurant. I had a cold and all I wanted was their chicken burro enchilada style. When I called for a to-go order (because I didn't want to eat there and infect the whole restaurant) I was put on hold and then told that per the manager they were not doing to-go orders that night. And it's not that they don't in general, I've had food to-go from there before. Why all of a sudden? No explanation given. Usually I give the service a bit of a pass because of the food, but after a couple of recent stumbles this was the last straw."}
{"text":"If you like spicy this is the place for you.  It is super delicious!!  Oh and the Sangria is excellent   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So I called to place a order to go and the guy who answers stated I couldn't order to go over the phone, but I could order to go by coming in... \"that they were too backed up to take my order over the phone\"  how hard is it to take a single order while I was in the phone with him? Will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Los Dos for about 20 years now.  I love their combination plate with the taco and enchilada.  I also eat a lot of the green and red sauce with chips.  I do miss their weird, kind of dirt tasting, iced tea they used to serve when Morris was alive.  Also, they changed their chips recently to a less oily type - I prefer greasy, salty chips.  But, they still my number one most favorite restaurant.  Update for 2016 - absolutely still addicted to the great food at Los Dos Molinos in Mesa.  Juan does a great job of following the exact original family recipes, and everything (except the iced tea) still tastes the same as when I started eating there in the early 1990's.  Chips are back to tasting the way they always did - and I try to eat at this place at least once a month.  I do miss their iced tea that had a \"dirt\" taste to it - maybe old water pipes in Mesa?"}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Los Dos Molinos restaurants on Alma School, and on Central, for over 20 years.  I decided to try this location, and although the recipes are slightly different,the food is very, very good - especially when compared to other local Mexican food restaurants (IMO).  This location is definitely a \"toned down\" version in terms of spiciness when compared to the other two locations I go to.  Service was absolutely excellent!  Pleasant place to eat - not too loud, and comfortable interior.   Food is prepared fresh - mostly from scratch -  and that is another reason I like it!"}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite restaurant in town.  Since they moved to thier Warner Road location, and brought on thier most excellent server / bartender / front-of-the-house guru Kyle, we make a point to visit almost every week.  We usually share a cheese crisp (add chicken and rojas), a generous side of guacamole and chived sour cream, and either the adobada ribs or the special of the day.  Today's special was a chili relleno stuffed burrito smothered in pork adobado.  My mother-in-law ordered it and i immediately got entree envy so we ordered one to go.  Huge portions, spicy dishes i crave for, and awesome frozen margaritas that leave us with a smile .  I guess you can tell were fans.  Yes, patience may be required, they get busy, its hand made, its family run, its not a chain.  Thier servers really try hard, and work together to get the job done.  Every employee is attentive and hardworking. Kyle is an asset to this location and we're always hoping he's working when we visit."}
{"text":"I love Los Dos Molinos! This is a restaurant that I have enjoyed going to for years now! The food is excellent, especially the Adovada Tacos which are a must!"}
{"text":"Pardon my language, but f this place. I am going to sound like a scorned lover here, but they treated me like an ass.  \"kitchen is closed\"  as they served 20 other patrons. Hate them. Great music though!"}
{"text":"The service is so slow the food is good if you I want good food without the bad service get it to go so sad we never seen our server since she took her or we ask for extra chips it came like after we asked five more times"}
{"text":"Had the machaca burro enchilada style. Was terribly salty... and I like more salt than most people.  The Empanadas and Salsa were both good. Been to this place a few times. It will wow you once in a while but will be disappointing more often."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch at Los Dos Molinos.   My spouse enjoyed the prickly pear margarita.     The green salsa was splendidly fiery.  The red salsa was a heartier version with less heat than the green salsa but more than most restaurants provide.  We both had the carne adovada and it was spectacular.   The sopapillas were enjoyable.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The food at the Camelback location was every bit as good as the one on Central south of Baseline.    We will definitely be stopping by this location again."}
{"text":"I've been a longtime fan of Los Dos in Ahwatukee, so I decided to give the Mesa location a try. I LOVE their spicy salsa, both red and green. This location was bigger than I expected it to be, very casual. I went for lunch with two friends on a Saturday afternoon. The service was a mixed bag - our waitress was realllllly slow. But gave us the good scoop on the best things to order. The bus boy was on top of his game. It took a great while for our dishes to arrive given the limited number of people in the restaurant, but DAMN was it delicious. I ordered the green chili chicken tortilla casserole (or something like that, I cannot remember the exact name) from their list of specialties on the menu. The beans I got on the side were forgettable. But the main dish...I will go back and back again for that delicious bowl of awesomeness. Green chili, shredded chicken, gooey cheesy goodness....spicy, but in a nose-running but I can't stop eating kind of way. AND with an over-easy egg on top. OMG it was incredible!!!! I also noticed they had a patio, so I know where I will be spending my next afternoon margarita day drinking episode. Yum."}
{"text":"WE have been eating at Los Dos for over 20 years.Since the Camelback location opened sometimes 2 times a week. We drive from Cave Creek and it is worth the drive.We heard the Cheryl from the South Central location had opened  her own restaurant so a little further drive for us,but was it worth it. The food at all locations is consistent in taste however what an experience we had at Cheryl's location in Ahwatukee. The Los Dos quality was there but with a beautiful presentation,we felt as though we were in a fine dining restaurant. As always service was the best and we felt as though we regulars even though it was our first time. Make the trip you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"I dont care what anyone says.ive been comming here for more than 20 years.hands down the bomb.those of you haters that have that sence of entitlement need to get over yourselves and get a clue.all home made and the chimmichanga is amazing.however this is a mexican resteraunt dummy so ya some of the waitstAff may have some broken english duh.yes it is spicy.very authentic love it here"}
{"text":"Being from New Mexico, I have found its very difficult to find quality New Mexican food in the Phoenix area. Los Dos Molinos has awesome and spicy food and the service is great!  Several servers and the owner checked in on me during my visit. Food was served quick and the free chips and salsa was a great appetizer. Definitely recommend for New Mexicans looking for a chile fix and everyone else who just wants a great meal!"}
{"text":"If I could rate the food and service that we had here Wednesday night higher I would. Chips and salsa were great. Excellent Roast Pork in red chile. Just the right level of heat for me. Hot buttered tortillas what's not to love. This place is the real deal. No Tex-Mex here. Only traditional  New Mexican food. I can't wait till the next time."}
{"text":"This place looks sketchy from outside but don't let that fool you! It's New Mexican authentic goodness. The staff was so friendly, food was like I was back in Farmington at my friends Grams house and the margaritas were fabulous. I couldn't even finish my massive plate of red chili but I damn sure tried. I will add this to my fave spots!"}
{"text":"I loved the pozole with red sauce, the sapapillas with honey, the guacamole.  The portions were awesome and I couldn't eat it all .  My husband had the special, the green chilli ribeye steak and it was huge.  It was cooked to perfection.    I am definitely looking forward to tasting more items on their menu."}
{"text":"worst meal ever!!! food came out cold....bad service... old brown guacamole!!! dont do it!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but the waitstaff absolutely sucks.  Super rude and condescending.  Not worth the time or money.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Came for drinks.... The New Mexican Ass is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible! We always take our out of town guests here and it is always a hit! It is by far the best in Ahwatukee. The staff is always so nice and welcoming as well. The blue corn tamales and flautas are my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"Really digging the vibe at the new Warner Rd location! Had lunch and drinks with my mom; we sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome- friendly, engaging- plus THEE best Michelada's! We had chili relleños  and pasole, which we both enjoyed. Homemade tortillas!!! So good. Although service (food) seemed to be a little slow, I don't think it's anything more than adjusting to a new location, etc. All the staff was very friendly! It felt like a place you could be a familiar face at and I'm definitely looking forward to going back!!! Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Yummy. Great New Mexican food. Spicy just the way I like it. There are  dishes such as Garlic Shrimp that are mild, but why when you can have braised ribs with enchilada sauce with home made corn tortillas and spicy red and green sauce. Not for the faint of heart. your nose will run but the flavor is well worth the little heat you will experience. Thanks Brian for taking us here. We'll be back I hope."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best restaurant I've had the pleasure of experiencing here in the Phoenix area! Their food is amazing, the drinks are stronger than any other place I've been too, and the family that runs it is fantastic at what they do! If you are looking to be waited on hand and foot and have state of the art facilities, maybe this isn't the place for you, but if you want quality, authentic New Mexican cuisine that is flavorful (and spicy), well made drinks that get you where you want to be,and enjoy a more eclectic, authentic facility and don't mind being a little patient from time to time... then, Los Dos Molinos is the spot for you. :)"}
{"text":"What a great meal, tasty, fresh, home made with moms loving care.  As business picked up the evening manager stepped in to help out servicing multiple tables to ensure everyone was taken care of.  Friendly staff and great food!!"}
{"text":"I went to Los Dos Molinos with high hopes, having heard great things about it.  The service was decent, though the wait staff just brought the check without asking if we wanted anything else.  The salsas (both red and green) were easily the highlight of the visit.  I may go back just to buy the salsa.  The chile relleno wasn't bad, but the rice was clearly yesterday's leftovers and the beans had a funky vinegar taste.  The sopapillas were also not what I was  expecting.  It wasn't bad food, but it certainly wasn't the best ever, either.  The decor was cute and fun."}
{"text":"Los Dos has some of the best tortillas ever - they're homemade, thick, soft, and just perfect.  The food is great and very flavorful, and the couple of times I've been here everything I've had has been good.  They also have quite a few daily specials in addition to what's on the main menu, so make sure you check those out.  The chips and salsa that they serve might be too spicy for some people, but in my experience, they're more spicy than most of the dishes, so don't worry if you think they're too hot.  The margaritas at Los Dos are also excellent and they're huge.  The atmosphere is also really cool and there's usually good music playing.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Ad this place to the bizarre Phoenix list. Don't get me wrong, the food is scorching and stellar, but everything else about this complex of tiny shacks in South Phoenix is a mindscrew. If you don't get there right when they open at 5, prepare to wait. And it might be a loooong wait. When you finally do get called in, there's about 12 different dining rooms you could be sitting in. Sure, they're all eclectic, but some are downright strange. The main dining room, with all kinds of crap hanging from the ceilings, is excellently atmospheric, in a kitschy sort of way.   As far as the grub, the New Mexican chilies they use are killer. They'll attack your taste buds throughout the meal, but they provide rich, complex flavors that can't be beat. The salsas, both the red (burn-your-ass hot) and the green (semi-burn-your-ass hot) are both as flavorful as any I've had. I get everything covered in the green, and I order a lot of margaritas. They come just as strong as the salsas."}
{"text":"We like los dos molinos lots. Definately a 5 star time. Excellent patio and interior dining. Kid friendly and yummy food in our opinion.  Garlic pork roast dishes are kinda their thing but they do everything well."}
{"text":"If possible, go to the location on Central or Alma School.  Unfortunately, this location does not do Los Dos justice. Considering this location is much closer to me, I have given them several chances to prove themselves. Although the food seems to be there, the service was not. This location is not terrible, but I'll make an effort to get to the Alma School location."}
{"text":"SO GOOOOODDDDD. I had the cheese enchilada and beef taco. best. decision. ever. really great flavors, the green chile sauce has such great flavor, a little spicy ... a lot of happy. service was fantastic and friendly. there were 8 of us and we were served extremely quick, with all dishes coming out at the same time (impressive).  a great lunch spot for a workday."}
{"text":"A friend of mine was in town from the East Coast and was craving Mexican.  I had never been here, but she suggested it so I was down.  We got there right when they opened (11am) and there were a few tables already seated.  The service was great!  Not sure if it was because we were there early, but they seated us immediately, came by and took our drink orders, and asked if we had any questions on the menu.  Since my friend and I hadn't seen each other in awhile, it took us a bit to even look at the menu, so we asked the waiter for a little more time.  They didn't rush us, but came back after a couple minutes, which was great, since soooo many places just ignore you after you ask for more time.  So thumbs up!  The downside is that this place is a bit pricey--I ordered a combination beef taco and green chile corn tamale with rice and beans ($12 or so).  The taco shell was nice and crispy, but the meat wasn't super flavorful and slighty greasy which I was not much a fan of.  But the tamale was delicious.  The portions are large and I only ate half of my meal.  But the tamale was so good that during my meeting I began thinking about it and I couldn't resist eating the rest of it at my desk.  So now I'm too full and ready to take a nap."}
{"text":"Not only is the food piping hot but the flavor is the best among most of the Mexican food restaurants that I frequent (too often). I love the food and atmosphere and the menu is great and unique. I would recommend that anyone try this restaurant just once so you can say that you dined at the best Mexican food restaurant in AZ."}
{"text":"Some like it hot... Not the best Mexican food that I've had, but I would definitely keep this one on my list.  The menu is very affordable and the food is wicked spicy, both of which I love.  I had the fish taco on  my last visit and loved their seemingly home made tortilla.  The chips and salsa that are placed on the table to begin with are not the best.  The chips could use more salt and the salsa could use a couple variations besides red/green.  Keep in mind...low price point so I'm not too judgmental."}
{"text":"Good stuff! They ain't kidding about the heat -- I had a good scalp sweat going just from the tasty chips and salsa -- but it's a flavorful kick, the way it should be (and the first thing delivered to the table was a pitcher of water, FTW);. Stopped by before a concert at The Nile, and the staff could not have been friendlier. The food was flavorful and there were a host of specials to choose from, including options for vegetarians and those looking for something less volcanic. Prices were very reasonable, and the house frozen marg was the size of a baby head and well-suited to quenching the fire from the Chiles. The capsaicin in chiles releases endorphins in your brain that can be addictive, and I'll be back for another hit."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Great SPICY food and even better service.  The owner and her family seem to know everyone that walks in.  Great margs, and did I mention the spiciest flavorful green chili I've ever had! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Los Dos Molinos and this one is just as good as any of them.  Maybe even with better service.  If you don't like spicy food this is not the place for you.  To come here and think you can order non spicy food is possible but it would be similar to going to a Sushi restaurant and ordering a hamburger.  If on the other hand you love heat and the more the better then Los Dos is for you.  I usually get the carne adovada which is cooked overnight and absolutely phenomenal.  Sometimes I will get the blue tamales or the enchilada platter or tacos.  They are also really good but nothing is better than the adovada in my book.  The green salsa and the red salsa are both very hot and delicious.  The rice and beans are also both well done.  Fluffy soft rice and flavorful beans.  Many Mexican restaurants seem to forget to make solid sides.  Los Dos does them both well.  The sopapillas are excellent too.  They come with four huge fluffy pieces sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon with a side of honey to dip them in.  Recommend to any spicy food lover."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend that lives in Buckeye. I was visiting from Cleveland. We have no New Mexican style restaurants in Cleveland. I will take this one home any day. All five in our group really enjoyed the food. It was nice to finally have heat without having to add it. The red salsa was awesome. Runny-nose goodness. I will definitely come back here the next time I visit the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are amazing and very spicy. I had the blue corn tamales with rice and beans; so good! Very good service and comfortable atmosphere. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Addicted for sure. Hot hot hot! Third time and loving the food.  Service was great and left with a full tummy of yummy spicy food."}
{"text":"Really tasty salsas (hot!) and the chili platter was really great (and very spicy too). They were also able to accommodate a large table reservation on a Saturday with little notice."}
{"text":"We had the adovada burro and it was excellent! Everyone there was extremely nice and we could tell there were a lot of regulars there."}
{"text":"Food is ok but for the love of Pete lose the  iPad check pay system! We want paper checks!!!  After having lunch with friends we were shown our individual bills on an iPad and asked to finger sign. Lunch with one entree and no drink was over $22 each with tax and tip. Really?  No detail of our bills and no paper receipts. Bad!!!"}
{"text":"The food was every bit as good as the many times we've dined at several Los Dos Molinos in the past. Too bad the overall experience was marred by such careless, lackadaisical service - inordinate wait times for drinks (and refills) plus two errors between what was ordered and what was served, and all this on a Saturday afternoon when few diners were there."}
{"text":"Reluctantly went back recently.  I have to say the service has picked up a lot.  They are still slow, however, that wasnt theproblem.  The problem was the lack of service and it seems to be getting much better.  The food is still really tasty.  Especially the carne adovado and the hatch green chile salsa."}
{"text":"The staff at Los dos molinos are incredible. We were getting ready to head to the airport and told them that we had craved their amazing spicy food for a whole year. We had tried them one year prior on a business trip. When they heard this, they packed our additional food items we had ordered for the plane ride home and added in a bunch of extra to remember them by. They treated us like family and we will be going back every time were in Phoenix. Even if it's just a layover."}
{"text":"Unreal.  Awesome.  I had the Enchilada plate green beef.  Soooo good.  And the atmosphere was nice with eclectic Mexican art and surroundings.  Everyone in our party of 7 enjoyed their food including the Carne Adovada ribs, Carnitas, and the New Mexico stew.  I was especially impressed with the rice and beans; multiple flavors popped with every bite!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"For those that like Spicy Hot food this place is great! Being from NM i am a bit biased but this place lives up to the NM restaurants and style.  They had a couple diff salsas which were tasty and spicy.  The Adovada ribs are really good, actually best i ever had, very large and tasty, Braised well with a nice chile sauce. Tortillas seem to be made there kinda Grandma style (thick)  Rest of food seem decent with a theme of spicy throughout, didn't try the drinks but will next time."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place.  The food is excellent and the service we have experienced has been beyond friendly and first class.  I read some reviews that said the service was so so - but our food was reasonably quick, it was good and staff were wonderful with our kids!  Even gave them a cheese crisp shaped like Mickey Mouse and some balloons to take home.  This Los Dos is further away from my home than other locations, but when I am in that part of town I will be stopping in!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexican in town.  The food is fresh alsways good and when they tell you something will be hot and spicy believe it!  The new location is great with a  nice bar and nice rooms with tables.  The staff is friendly and know their stuff.  The recommendation I got was for a beef stacked enchilada dinner with the green chili.  It is now my favorite and I honestly think it is perhaps the best Mexican dish in town.    The only downside is the parking lot.  I do not reallly like a parking lot that is lined with razor wire fences and hard to get in and out of - but I guess if the biggest complaint is the parking lot I can live with it.  Go, enjoy, have the enchilada and enjoy the heat!"}
{"text":"First timers.  We were a party of about 25.  I know the wait staff was overwhelmed, it took a while for them to get it together, but once they did they kicked butt.  The red and green chile dinners were excellent.  The chile relleno was delicious.  Once the orders were taken the followed. In a timely manner.  Would definitely recommend this place to those looking for great food."}
{"text":"The best New Mexican style food in the valley!  Great staff, margaritas and the best carne adovado ribs everrrr !!"}
{"text":"Just had the Adovada burrito Christmas tree style (half red sauce half green sauce) on top with the rice and beans. It was delicious. Just right on spicy. Device was awesome. Chips and Salsa was awesome. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this one and the one in Mesa on Alma School. The food is excellent. In terms of food only, I think it's arguably the best in the valley.  It's spicy, flavorful and well prepared.  Anything on the menu is delicious.   Regarding the \"spice\" factor. If you are not used to eating ethnic food or spicy food, the salsa will be really hot for you so avoid it. If you are used ot eating Indian, Thai, Chinese etc. then you will actually like the sauce and question why all the other salsas in the valley are bad.    That being said, the Service is horrible and it's been horrible for the last 10 years or so.  They charge for refills on chips. They give you very little chips in a small tin bowl.  They don't refill your drinks. They take forever before you order.  They are inflexible in altering items to cater to vegetarians (Im not vegetarian but I've been there with vegetarians). The waiters have attitude.   If the service was somewhat respectable, I would eat there more often. Still the food is delcisious but go there with the expectation that you will pay a lot of moneyand endure horrible service.  This is one of the few places in Phoenix that I will endure bad service because the food is so good."}
{"text":"I thought they closed the Mesa restaurant (I was there over a year ago). Anyway, \"I've been to this one and the one on Central in Phoenix. The food is excellent. In terms of food only, I think it's arguably the best in the valley.  It's spicy, flavorful and well prepared.  Anything on the menu is delicious.    About the Mesa vs. Phoenix thing...to be honest, I think the Mesa one tastes better. The Mesa one definitely tastes more authentic and has more flavor. The Phoenix one tastes more Americanized as if it is geared toward Gringos.  That being said, the Service is horrible and it's been horrible for the last 10 years or so. No, I'm not being hard on them.  They charge for refills on chips!!!! They give you very little chips in a small tin bowl.  They don't refill your drinks. They take forever before you order.  They are inflexible in altering items to cater to vegetarians (Im not vegetarian but I've been there with vegetarians). The waiters have attitude and leave before you can ask questions.   If the service was somewhat respectable, I would eat there more often. Still the food is delicous but go there with the expectation that you will pay a lot of money and endure horrible service.  It's almost a joke because the service is so consistently bad the owner doesn't really care because people still eat there. NOTE TO THE OWNER: Yes, people eat there with bad service but if you provided better service, guys like me would eat there 20 times a year instead of twice a year!    P.S.  The best Margaritas in the WORLD...I've been everywhere and you won't get  abetter margarita. It's not Kool Aid nor is it tequila with lime....strong but actually tasty. Don't order a pitcher though. It's a rip-off. They water it down to save money"}
{"text":"Wow where to start. This place is filthy dirty, the food was terrible ( my flour tortilla was a rancid grease paperweight) and the service is nonexistent. I feel as though they have already closed the doors in their minds. Do yourself a favor and skip this place. It used to be good spicy food. Now it's just sad."}
{"text":"The menu states, \"You order it, you own it!\"!  Yes, this place is not for spicy food light weights!  My margarita was awesome, even though they made it without the Agave syrup, as requested.  It packed a punch!  Thank you!  And my chimichanga was sooooo good!  I think I heard angels singing instead of the mariachi band?   I am a green sauce person, my guest is a red sauce person.  So, we ordered our usuals, green sauce chimichanga for me and a red sauce wet burrito for him!  After our food arrived,  we did our typical food swap.....  To my surprise,  even though I loved my green chimichanga in front of me,  I loved the red even more!  He loved MY green sauce more than his red!  Sauce so good it made us change teams!  Sauce teams that is! . What a beautiful food experience!  Can't wait to go back and try more menu items!"}
{"text":"This was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had!!!!  The staff was so friendly.  I was in town on business and ate at the bar alone.  The chips and salsa were perfect and the #5 combo with red chile was simply amazing!  I'd suggest washing it all down with the kick-ass margarita.  OMG!  The entire experience was wonderful.  The place looks a little scary when you first pull up and walk in but do not let the fear take over.  I'd live there if I was a local."}
{"text":"Poor service, poor quality food and the place was FILTHY! My wife and I made the bad mistake of going to Los Dos Molinos for dinner on 3/21/2012. We  had to ask for silverware, chips and salsa, water and drinks. After I stopped another server and asked for water, the manager Brent walks over and asks \"how we doing tonight, folks\". Bad mistake on his part because I let him know that I usually go to location on Central Ave. and expected the same level of service at this location. He tried to explain that they they were understaffed and the place was really busy. WRONG, the restaurant was half full. At one point we did not see a server come into the patio area for 9 minutes.  The food was of poor quality. I ordered Shrimp Veracruz and my wife ordered Chile's Relleno. Bland, tasteless overcooked food. We could have had better quality at Baja Fresh or Rubios. On the Patio was an open garbage can, top off, also stacks of dirty dishes on table. Both of these close to the eating area. As I walked through the main part of the restaurant to go the bathroom, I observed food scraps littering the floor. When we left some time later, the garbage was still on the floor. That was out first and LAST time at Los Dos Molinos on 4025 E. Chandler Blvd. With the hundreds of Mexican restaurants in the Valley, the poor quality of LDM was suprising."}
{"text":"My faith in the Yelp community is completely lost. The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the margarita and salsa were good. I'm not sure if everyone who has reviewed this place was drunk when they ate but this is seriously the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. The chicken was bland and somehow smelled like farts. The beef lacked as much flavor as it did texture, it was like baby food. The beans weren't bad, the rice was nothing special. The only thing worse than the food was the service. I think we saw the server twice, to order and chase down our check. I would seriously like to take all these people with 3+ star reviews out to a real Mexican restaurant, on me, just so they would know what they're missing."}
{"text":"This is a special place to eat.  We love the decor.  The food and service were excellent.  Highly recommended is the chili relleno burro.  Wow.  So tasty.  The street tacos were amazing. The homemade chips were light and crisp.  Salsa was spicy and tantalizing.  Made you crave more.  The Mexican cerviche was served in a wine goblet.  A generous portion with a perfect degree of heat.    There is live music on Friday.  This is a place to have real Mexican food, not Tex-Mex."}
{"text":"Very yummy crunchy tacos, and cheese chips were very good! I'll definitely come back to try more."}
{"text":"Returned to Los Dos Molinas last Friday after 25 years. Wow!  Since 1977. Really enjoyed the food & margaritas. Having lived in NM for a few years, I really appreciate the green chile & red chile dishes. Definitely HOT!  YUM!"}
{"text":"So goooood. We came here Saturday night for dinner with a reservation for 7. Got seated right away and they had a table arranged to accommodate us all. We had all been here before so we weren't playing around when it came time to order. 2 pitchers of the kick ass margarita and majority got the enchilada dinners. Chips and salsa to start off obviously. Food came out pretty quick for a busy and packed Saturday night at 6pm. Someone in he restaurant had a birthday so the staff came out banging pots and pans and the lights went out so they could light up the birthday dessert. It was neat and original. Probably one of the best New Mexican restaurants in AZ."}
{"text":"Great New Mexican restaurant on Camelback with a lot of flavor and tons of spiciness in each dish. Lots of cool flare and Knick knacks adorn the walls in a western motif. Food is amazing. Chips and salsa to tart you off right. The red salsa is hot. I was sweating after one bite and my tongue was tingling for quite awhile after. The green salsa isn't as bad but still has a bit of kick. Tacos, tortas, flautas, burritos, and smothered and covered enchiladas line the menu with beans and rice. The flavor of the food is great and the spice stays on your tongue long after you're done eating. The fresh margarita is sooo delicious and comes in a big rectangle cup loaded with tequila. Service is pretty prompt as well even when it gets busy. I like how they leave the water pitcher at your table so you can refill as needed. Arizona is full of Mexican food, but Los Dos definitely ranks among the top."}
{"text":"If you're a  Taco Bell lover,this isn't the Mexican food for you. However, if you love a little (or a lot) of heat and authentic Mexican food, which is carefully prepared, this is IT! My friend had the pork and I had machaca, and both were absolutely fabulous. You can taste the wonderful flavors in every bite, and can tell that great care was taken in preparing our lunches. In talking with the owner, it appears that there have been some service issues since this location opened in December, but apparently, those issues have been resolved.  The restaurant is very nicely decorated, and although they were somewhat busy, we had great service and a perfect meal.  If only Los Dos Molinos were in Scottsdale...."}
{"text":"Drive by here all the time. Close to work. Outside is a little iffy. Easy to drive past. Inside is a pleasant surprise with interesting tidbits hanging on the walls creating a fun atmosphere. Free chips arrive at the table with both red and green salsas. Ordered the Carne Adovada Burrito with the Xmas tree toppings of both green and red chili sauce. It also came with beans and rice. A mouth full of flavors all at once. Reminded me of what we call \"Tex Mex\" style back in TX but with the flavors of New Mexico. Definitely spicy which I enjoy. Expected the layering of flavors and textures to pop a little more. I hear each location is a little different. Gets really busy fast at lunch. Undaley!"}
{"text":"I ordered out from this restaurant because I work a block away.  I was born and raised in New Mexico so I was pretty excited to have some authentic New Mexican food so close.  The chili is pretty hot and the food is authentic.  It's actual hatch.  The atmosphere is quiet and personal, a genuine mom-and-pop place.   My only reserve about this place is their overload of cilantro in their salsa.  New Mexican salsa doesn't have cilantro and even so, they are quite heavy with it.  I would recommend it and would go again."}
{"text":"Chose this place based on some other reviews. I should have read more carefully. I had Vicki's Plate. The chicken was really dry, sauce was so hot, I couldn't taste the food and guacamole so bland.  Skip this one and keep driving."}
{"text":"A few friends recommended Los Dos to us and we finally made it over there. Definitely a bit of a drive from Waddell, but worth every mile. The chips were fresh and crispy, but not greasy and the salsa is flavorful but be warned that when they say it is hot, it certainly is. New Mexican heat is completely different from Mexican heat so it will spring up on you. I had The Fresh margarita which is a blended margarita with Raspberry liquor and it was refreshing. My husband had a Fruta prickly pear margarita on the rocks and he was extremely pleased with it. For lunch I enjoyed the shredded beef flautas which come with guacamole and an herbed sour cream. Gosh they were good. Our littles shared a bean and cheese burrito that was a hit and my husband had the 2 blue corn enchiladas with rice, beans and added a red chili beef tamale. Everything was flavorful and not a bite was spared. We will definitely be returning again and again. This location was also fun and had a very authentic vibe."}
{"text":"Went for Mothers Day and they had live music on the patio. Nice experience. Half the restaurant was shut down for some reason. Felt a little cramped. The food, while very generous portion wise, wasn't the best Mexican food I've had. Lot better quality options of you are willing to drive a little father."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?   Let's start with the server who literally yelled everything he asked or said to us. Oh, and then he rammed a chair into my leg and was just not very concerned about our experience overall.  Let's move on to the cheese crisp, which had plenty of grease cascading off the pieces, and virtually no \"crisp.\" Did you put some cheese on a tortilla and microwave it? 'Cause I could have done that at home.  Both drinks were quite tasty- my tea was strong like I like it, but not bitter. Hubby's lemonade was very good, but he drank it so fast I didn't get a chance to steal many sips.  Let's discuss the entrees, shall we? Hubby's carne adovada chimi was decent, better than my carnitas. In fact, MY carnitas is better. (I keep aiming for Chef Hector's at Sam's...) Yes, the pork was very tender, but the salt was -shall I put it nicely?- aggressive. Sam Kinneson aggressive. The \"tortilla\" was an inedible science experiment. Thick and doughy, and made even more appetizing by the charred side, it reminded me of the salt play dough we all made as kids, formed into a pancake. Truly nasty.  As for the legendary salsas, Hubby found the green to be tasty, but he did not care for the flavor of the red. Neither was especially fiery to him either.   Riding on reputation, are we?"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch yesterday because I met one of the owners and his wife the other night and they told me to check it out. SO HAPPY I DID!! It was soooo good! I love Mexican food and I've never tried New Mexican food... this food is WAY better than any Mexican food I've ever had. I want to go back and try everything on the menu! There is so much flavor and spice in the food it's unbelievable. They also have a nice margarita menu!! I can't wait to go back many, many times! Everyone is very friendly!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food place but beware of the heat! Spicy but yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Amidst the abundance of pawn shops, auto repairs and payday loan storefronts lies the haven that is Los Dos Molinos.  If you feel that you have entered a garage sale/thrift store, you have found your refuge.  Your synapses will be overloaded as you take in the random yet tasteful decorum.  The classy plastic Statue of Liberty tugs at your patriotic heartstrings and the tinsel covered atrium makes everyday feel like Cinco de Mayo.  Simply smelling the tantalizing food was almost satisfying enough, which was perfect because I was only interested in the margaritas.  Liquid diet.  Prickly pear pitcher of margaritas is a steal of a deal and was empty all too soon."}
{"text":"This is great New Mexican food. It is pricey being from New Mexico and Colorado area it's hard to pay 13.95 for a green chili plate. however,when you want really great spicy New Mexican food it's WORTH EVERY dime! Blue corn tortillas, hot salsa, yes please!!"}
{"text":"If you are going to serve New Mexican food, then serve it, don't water it down and serve things up like they do in the real state. I spent a month there and nobody in hell would use a whole Green chile in making the Chile Relleno. You use either a Poblano or an Aneheim and then cover it in your green chile sauce. The guy next to us eating his meal was complaining alot about how the sauce wasn't hot at all.      Chips and salsa were free at the bar - they were decent with two salsa's. Also noticed like another Yelper did that the food comes out like 2 minutes after ordering. This can only mean one thing, nothing is made to order and that means you can do alot better than the food here. The fake Chile Relleno was enough to send my running."}
{"text":"great food.. I ate at the bar.. the bartenders are really busy, everything is fresh.. The food was cooked perfect, and staff were attentive.. not a place to meet people everyone was on their phones.. but that was fine"}
{"text":"What a great place!  Definitely did not disappoint! The decor is quirky and clean. All of the staff that helped us was friendly and knowledgable. Service was very fast too, especially for a Saturday night!  We had the Carne Adovada Chimichanga and the Victoria's Chicken Chile plate (green chile) with the Spicy Beans (not on the menu), and a side of sour cream.  Everything was delicious.  The green chile sauce was very spicy, but had a great taste.  Not just spicy to say it is spicy.  Truly delicious!  Both the chicken and the pork were juicy and cooked to perfection.  As mentioned in other reviews, the sour cream was a perfect touch to help manage the heat levels.  Topped dinner off with a pitcher of the fresh margaritas and 1800 tequila...  Perfect compliment.  Can't wait to come back to this place on our next trip!!!"}
{"text":"Sadly I am compelled to leave such a low rating. The food is always good, but the service was TERRIBLE! We had to wait for any kind of service. Yeah, I get I'm at a restaurant. But when there is nobody in the place, that's a problem."}
{"text":"First time I've ever ate Mexican Empanadas....Even though I'm chinese the shape of the fried dumpling reminded me of some of my grandmother's fancy chinese dumplings that she made....I wish I had a picture of some of her creations to show how similar the style of the pastry is compared to empanadas...  Los Dos gave me a wonderful stroll down memory lane."}
{"text":"Some like it HOT!!! If you can't take it spicy, this is truly the wrong place for you kid! The food is great and best of all, authentic. Well worth the long wait!   Goce!"}
{"text":"My bf and I came here to eat on Sunday. We were able to find a seat quickly. Everyone was friendly and polite. I had the Green Chile Stew and he had the Ribs. Both were amazing! The bartender was great and gave us some recommendations for the next time we come in! This is our favorite!"}
{"text":"Oh Los Dos... How I love thee.  I've been a regular here for the last 18 years and the food has always been amazing. If you are okay with spicy hot food you're going to love this place. Super friendly staff, amazing food, unpretentious atmosphere, and awesome huge frozen margaritas! My favorite meal is the pork burrito with red sauce and raspberry frozen margarita.  Great... now I'm craving their food again!"}
{"text":"It was a pleasant surprise.    My husband and I are spending a few days in the area and found this treasure following a visit to South Mountain.  He had the ribs which were great and I chose the chicken taco salad,  the shell was great,  normally can't eat the shells because too greasy, not this one and generously filled with fresh chicken.   We also loved the salsa    Thanks for adding a great dining adventure to our vacation."}
{"text":"This trip was so so.  The service was great.  But the green salsa was watery and not as blistering hot as usual.  The carne adovads burro was VERY small.  Had as much filling as a couple enchiladas.  A burrito should be thick and round.  This was small and flat like a large enchilada.  Barely and red or green sauce on top.  Had i done this ala cart and paid 2.25 for enchilada style i would have complained. i still should have.  For the price this meal was a poor value (and they charged a buck for another serving of the red sauce).   Much better food experience at the Camelback location"}
{"text":"I first saw this place while I was on light rail going to basket ball game. The stop is nearby and it makes it easy to get to. The food here is very good! Everything I get here tastes home made and offers just the right amount of spice. Their salsas are very delicious! I always get the enchiladas or the bean burritos served enchilada style. Both the red and green sauce are very tasty. The service is always very fast and helpful. We came here late one night and were one of the only people left, but the waitress never hurried us and was very courteous."}
{"text":"I love the patio and overall decor of this new location. Its close to nearby Biltmore area so I find myself in the area quite a bit. The salsas they use here are spicy! I love it but others might not be able to handle the heat. The house margaritas is one of the best in the valley in my opinion. They had a good selection of mexican beers on draft: dos equis lager, pacifico, victoria, negro modelo.   I always get the carne adovado which is a slow roasted pork in red sauce. Its wrapped in a soft tortilla and topped with cheese. It pretty much melts in your mouth with the right amount of spice. The enchiladas here are also very good. Overall, this place tests less greasy and with none of the weird aftertaste I get with other mexican places like arribas,etc."}
{"text":"The entire experience was a giant \"Meh\" all around.  We reserved a table for six and were squished around a table for four.  It's wasn't terrible but it would behoove a dining establishment to make it larger-group-friendly.    The happy hour house margaritas were okay.  They tasted pretty watered down.  We ordered a pitcher later (at full price, of course) and it tasted better.  That's major points lost for me - an inferior happy hour version or Restaurant Week version does not inspire me to return.    Service was extremely slow although to their credit, it does say they're slow on the menu so they get points for honesty.  One of my dining companions noted that the menu says they charge $1 for a refill on chips.  That's a sad excuse for a Mexican joint in my opinion.    My food was spicy but just okay.  I got the feeling they cover up the average-ness of the food with a lot of spice.    It felt like one of those places where they nickel-and-dime you for everything.  I expect that at fast food restaurants but for a sit-down meal?  Where we would have likely lingered and spent money?  No thank you."}
{"text":"Lovely family place in an eclectic setting. The food is only faintly reminiscent of Northern New Mexican food. Maybe more like Deming. The salsa ( red and green) should most definitely not be the same as the enchilada sauce. Fry bread or sopapilla would be better than a crisp white-flour tortilla called \"Mexican pizza.\"  Lovely people, fun setting, good sangria, forgettable food."}
{"text":"We have been to a number of the Los Dos Molinos and have always enjoyed the food. So we were really glad to see one finally open in our side of town a few years ago. And this one does not disappoint. We have gone a number of times. Only once did we receive what we would consider poor service, and it was a new waiter who was a little slower than normal. It gave us the opportunity to enjoy our conversation, and the chips and salsa. If you are going to visit, be aware: most of the food is spicy. In case you forget, they do warn you on the menu."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but last time we went it was 8:55pm on a friday night and the host looked at us like we grew another head when we wanted to be seated for dinner. He basically chased us out of the restaurant. SERIOUSLY! Another place where service breaks it for me, and so I won't go there anymore."}
{"text":"Really good food! Just as all the other reviewers have mentioned the salsa is SPICY! Some of the food items have a chili next to them to indicate it's a spicy menu item.... So take the warning!  Received a free cheese crisp for checking in on Yelp and it was delicious! The staff wasn't overly talkative/friendly until we told them how much we liked the food but they weren't rude either. We were one of three tables that sat at the same time so probably just time managing!  Overall... I'd go back! :)"}
{"text":"Parking:  It sucks, deal with it, it isn't as bad as some places.  Decor:  Come on people it's about the food, the place is clean and the chairs are comfy.  Service:  Well, I've always gotten pretty good service, they can be slow on the bill and sometimes they disappear, but in general I order, get my drinks, get my food and that's about all.  Food:  It's AWESOME, it's HOT, it's NEW MEXICAN Chili's!!!!  I love the green chili pork, I also get a side of sour cream to cool my mouth, but I think it is perfect!  The drinks are strong, the deserts are really good, I don't need much more out of a restaurant.    Don't have super high expectations, understand the food is SPICY, and be prepared to be wowed!"}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here after reading the reviews. Then I ate there and I was less excited.   I was prepped for some hot spicy New Mexican food. That did not arrive on my plate. It was tasty for sure but I was lead to believe that I would experience the food I grew up with in New Mexico. I didn't.   It is possible that my expectations were too much for this restaurant to handle."}
{"text":"This place was hard to find.  I should have just kept driving but I wanted Mexican food.  Be warned their food is extremely spicy.  It will numb your lips and make you flushed.  If that is your kind of food, drop on by.  The yelp checkin is for cheesy something or other.  It is a entire pizza pie of  cheese melted on a tortilla.  I had no idea it was going to be so huge.  Save this for a group.  The place is loud and child friendly.  This means they do not ask their patrons to control their children so they are running around and generally making a nuisance of themselves.   I spent over $20 on food and drink i didnt enjoy or even eat all of itl  It was a pity. I could have dined at a place with better ambience and food.  Glad I have good Mexican places at home."}
{"text":"My new standard for Mexican food!  The food is perfectly spicy walking the delicate balance of spice and flavor.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The only complaint I could imagine is that the food and salsa is too spicy, but of you like spicy food, you'll love Los Dos Molinos.  I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"It has been awhile since my taste buds have been assaulted by the grand poobah of New Mexican cuisine, but the memory is still fresh in my mind.  It's kind of like the first time you had sex  -- it may not have been that pleasant of an experience, but you'll never forget it.   Los Dos Molinos is a spicy food lovers dream. If you like to sweat while you eat and like to eat jalapenos like they're M&Ms, then by all means get yourself to Los Dos. The food is THAT spicy, but it isn't too overpowering, that is, if you pick the right entree. I've had their red cheese enchiladas, and they ARE muy caliente. And, you think the beans will cool off your tongue? Nope, those are laced with jalapenos as well. The only way to truly cool off the explosion of spice in your mouth is with a nice, cold, frozen or on the rocks Margarita.  Overall, I enjoy Los Dos for what it is -- an adventure for my taste buds. I have to say, though, it isn't a place I could go to on a regular basis; I don't think my stomach could handle it. But, it is a fun place to take those out-of-town guests who've never experienced real Southwestern food. They'll leave with either a smile or a scowl. But whichever way, they'll never forget it!"}
{"text":"Very tasty!!  The handmade tortillas are wonderful, the taste and the heat are very good, tender pork rib meat and the stacked enchilada's are Muy Delicioso!!    Decor is actually pretty cool, especially considering it is in an auto repair complex, maybe that adds to the experience!  We will certainly be going back!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my once-a-month spots, but not anymore. Normally I get the Chimichanga, which comes with a side of guac and sour cream for somewhere around $11. Today I tried the burro, a la carte (no rice or beans). I missed the side of guac and sour cream, so I ordered it. The burro was $8.95. The side of guac and sour cream was $6.50. How does that make any sense at all? No, the server didn't inform me of the added cost when I ordered it. On top of that, the service was absolutely horrible. I had to flag someone down to order. There were only 2 other individuals in the place, and they were at the bar.  So when I got my bill for $21, needless to say, I was furious. I frankly am ashamed of myself for paying that and leaving a tip on top of it.  I informed the bartender (because my waitress was nowhere to be found) that I would not come back. He didn't seem to care.  I am certain this location will not be in business for long if this is the way they continue to operate. What a shame."}
{"text":"I really like Los Dos Molinos - I have been going there on and off for close to 20 years!  The food is excellent Southwestern, New Mexico style cooking in a casual, traditional family-run restaurant environment.    My only complaint is the same as one of my likes!  The food can be too hot!  There are not options to get the food a bit less hot (spicy!), so you have to be prepared for the spicy hot - but the flavor is well worth it!  I recently had the posole which was fantastic - and it is one of the few places outside of New Mexico where you can finish a meal off with Sopapillas (always a treat!).  Overall, I highly recommend Los Dos Molinos (but be prepared for even the menu items not marked as spicy to have some heat! - but great flavor!!)."}
{"text":"I was sooo bummed when  we were met at the door by your lunch crowd, being ushered out.... with their lunches in hand. What was up with that??? Health dept violation???? That's the only reason for a lunch shut down....hmmmm...o"}
{"text":"If you are looking for spicy Mexican food, this is the place. I ordered the spicy pork ribs. My waiter said they weren't really ribs. But more like the shoulder. That was fine by me. Less mess. The meat was tender and spicy. The rise was good. The guacamole was tasty but odd. It looked like there was sour cream mixed in. I had never seen that before. I was disappointed in the margarita selection. It seemed most were pre-mixed with low grade tequila. I got the impression that they only have low quality tequila. If they had top shelf, my waiter dos not indicate this as an option. I ordered the hand mixed margarita. Honestly, the tequila had an odd taste to me. I switched to soda instead. I would go back for their spicy entrees. But I won't order a margarita again."}
{"text":"Loved Los Dos, food is still great quality, service is where the 1 star happens. 3 went in for dinner, ended up being there for over 3 hours, drinks forgotten and left empty for a ridiculous amount of time. All three won't return after this experience, our completely forgot about us, and would pop up at our table without previously mentioned drinks or appetizers and then say he was going to get them and disappear for another 25 mins and come back again with no drinks or appetizers.... it was not packed either."}
{"text":"I didn't realize there were two locations. I had loved my visit to the one of Central Ave, so I expected the same when we went here a few weeks ago before a Suns Game. Unfortunately, the service was slow, the very expensive margaritas were made from a big slushy machine and our orders got mixed up with the wrong sauces.  I used to say Los Dos was one of my fave mexican restaurants in town. I should amend that to say Los Dos on Central is one of my fave mexican restaurants. And, since its not that close to my home, I'll just keep going to Valle Luna on Bell...where the service and food is great. Maybe not as hot, but much better quality."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Food ok but my husband's machaca taco was more jalapeño than meat.  We waited a long time for food & even longer for the check. Not busy & servers were running around but not taking care of customers. I really wanted this place to overcome its horrible start but it didn't."}
{"text":"John the owner by far demonstrates what customer service is all about. We are greeted with a smile. One thing in particular that I like, is that John always is on the floor building relationship with his customs which is why we keep coming back. Honestly, I feel like a part of the family."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Everytime that I have eaten here, everything has been delicious and the staff is very courteous. If you dont like Spicy food, this is NOT the place for you. Even the food on the menu without the pepper next to it has a little spice. My favorites are the hard chicken tacos, carnitas, and adovada short ribs. If you save enough room, you have got to try the sopapilla with ice cream. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"The only negative was how loud the restaurant is when you want to visit with family.  All of my family is hispanic and this was some of the best mexican food we have eaten, outside of home cooking.  All of our dishes were SPICY!  We loved all of the food as well.  The sopaipillas were a little salty, but that could just be a mistake in one batch made."}
{"text":"Some of the best New Mexican Mex you will ever find! Started by two sisters who moved to NYC and have the same restaurant there right in the city.   It's always a toss up as to which one of the salsas (red or green) will be hottest. The adovado ribs are a must have as are some of the combination plates or enchiladas dinner. Also, the lemonade is fresh squeezed and perfectly tart!   An old favorite of the AZ locals for many years!"}
{"text":"My wife went for pickup. COmpletely disorganized. Called in or at 545pm. Said 20 minutes. She got there at 6pm and waited until 635pm. No comp or anything from manager and restaurant was bustling but not busy.  Bartender apologized several times & was friendly.  Food was bad. Did not resemble any of the great food we've had at other PHX & NYC locations. THe beans were so salty they were nearly inedible and the enchiladas were not anything like the ones we've had prior. The chicken's consistency did not inspire much confidence.  Either they are still getting organized (3 months later) or something is very wrong at this location. Maybe it's just the Ahwatukee restaurant curse. Go across the street to Secreto instead."}
{"text":"The food is worth 4 stars but I took a star away because their hours suk.  They're closed Tues - Fri from 2:30-5pm. They're also closed on Sunday & Monday. Their food does taste authentic but it's on the more expensive side.  Their margaritas are pretty weak - they're poured from this pitcher that's refrigerated so they're not freshly made."}
{"text":"Dual review for Mesa and Central Phoenix Locations:  I have never noticed a difference in food for either location. Some like it hot is true!!!!  I have been on about a six year love affair with the adovada ribs. This is the dish to get here, if you are excited about the the heat, and want something amazing.  My wife who is not as into the heat, or meat and has been quite happy with Bean and Cheese Burro, and cheese crisp. Margarita's are good but expensive. We have had many a great evening there drinking and waiting for a table.   Central location: Great atmosphere, wonderful area to wait for your table, and you will wait as there is not very much seating inside. Evenings they will open the bar so you can get chips, salsa, and drinks. I think my favorite part is sitting out side and waiting,until I eat the food then the wait does not matter any more.  Mesa location:  Much bigger, and more seating it is in an auto strip mall, no waits there, however not as nice and welcoming as the central location, in fact they have painted a mural of the central location (I heard it was Tom Mix's house) on the wall inside the Mesa location. The food has always been just as good. However given the option I would drive out to south mountain every time.  Great place that we will be going to for many years to come."}
{"text":"Like most people said, the food here is bursting with flavor and color.  Very rich taste overall with salsa that has a kick.  The pork is tender and has a marinated texture that doesn't need much help on it's own.  I did the check in for the free cheese crisp, the food was $12.95 so with the drink and tip it's a $20 lunch.  Not a cheap lunch, but a nice place to go when you want something that stands out from the typical fare.    Good service, friendly staff, easy to find, free refills, free chips and salsa.  They give you a pitcher of ice water so you don't down a gallon of soda or tea to cool down your tongue."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very poorly managed.  We waited in the reception area; with multiple other prospective diners; for greater than 30 minutes without any acknowledgement from any staff member.  You get the sense they don't care; or don't know what appropriate behavior is.  Since we were with a couple who wanted to try the food; we waited.  Once seated continued poor service.  15 mins to get water and 30 minutes to get a beer and 45 mins for the food..  Ultimately, a bartender offered the explanation that they were overwhelmed by several large, last minute reservations.  Maybe.  None of that is an excuse for the poor service and lack of communication to the customers. Maybe consider staffing your restaurant appropriately.  It's always understaffed.   Maybe Acknowledge those waiting and let them know it will be a long wait.  Several people waiting just left. The food was good; not great; for new mexico style mexican.   Too bad more people don't vote with their feet and not patronize this reastaurant until they get their act together."}
{"text":"We tried to show up at 8:30. And for the third time in a row we were turned away because they closed early. On a Saturday. This really sucks because the food is wonderful. But WE ARE DONE. We will not be returning. This, quite possibly, is the most poorly run restaurant I have ever encountered."}
{"text":"Ok, let's start with the positives... the decor is cool and New Mexican eclectic, margaritas were delish and that's where that ends.  Took them well over 10 minutes to greet us. That's right I said greet us! We stood there contemplating wether we were wearing our invisible suits or they were just that rude. They finally acknowledged our presence and we were sat. 15 minutes later, they came to ask our drink order. They immediately brought those out and then we asked for a minute to look over the menu. They brought our appetizer (guacamole) which I could have made a better one in my car flying on the I10 westbound to LA (Been done). A while back our waiter decides to come back, don't get me wrong he was nice but just way too slow of service. He then took our food order, I ordered cheese enchiladas with green sauce. When that came out it looked really good but in all honesty, they were flavorless and cheese-less! How can they mess up such a good thing? Anyway, I can't say I'll find myself dining there again."}
{"text":"We LOVE the outdoor seating while waiting for your table and the hot, hot food.  This is a NEW Mexican restaurant, so you don't judge this as Tex-Mex or Mexican.    It is hot, so be aware.  There are warnings.  The wait is long, so plan on people watching on the patio of Tom Mix's former home."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times. The food is always delicious and the service attentive. The green tamales are spicy and flavorful. And the chile verde was delish. Get the hand squeezed margarita, it's worth the extra 25 cents."}
{"text":"Best Mexican/New Mexican food in the valley, bar none! I come here regularly. Anything with adovada pork is spectacular! I usually get the adovada burrito dinner. I love it so much, I could marry it! Friendly staff, casual, clean atmosphere, salsa that clears your sinuses and burns your nose hair, while having spectacular FLAVOR... What more could you ask for? Word of caution: anything on the menu that has a chili next to it is SPICY! They mean it when they designate a dish as \"spicy!\" I love, love, love spicy and flavor, so Los Dos, Mesa is my one true love of Mexican food joints in the valley. If you're not a fan of spice, ask your server for alternatives. My non-spicy companions have always complimented the food, but I don't play on that team. ;)"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. The food was bad & expensive. The wait is ridiculous. Don't go."}
{"text":"This place is great (shredded beef chimichanga w/ green sauce!!)  Saturday night place was packed, 7:15pm, 20 minute wait we where told after waiting 5-10 minutes probably too 25-30 instead of 20 but the where slammed!!!  Got our table place is packed little loud but not too bad. We where read to order when we sat down waiter came a few minutes later dropped off chips placed the orders  and he was gone --- never saw him till we got food never did get to place a drink order  Food was great came got our plates and again gone waited 30 minutes finally I had to go find someone to get the bill   I'm posting this review hoping management may see it  You can turn tables quicker if you get people their bill soon after picking up empty plates --- customers can get seated sooner  You can get more $$ from your customers if the waiter take the time to let you order drinks  Foods great staff friendly eager to help if you can find them, maybe it was just one of those nights?"}
{"text":"This establishment was very good overall. Waitress was nice, food was excellent (pretty spicy).  If you don't like hot things I'd be careful of what you order. The only complaint I'd have is that they were understaffed. There was one Waitress handling 7 different tables. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"If you like spicy foods then this place is for you. Food is very spicy but excellent. Great little seating area outside which is great when the weather is nice. Food is fresh and hot and beer is cold, along with good margaritas."}
{"text":"I thought this place was really good! I loved the decor and atmosphere. My girlfriend and I split a margarita pitcher and I thought the margaritas were a bit too sweet. Initially I questioned the alcohol content but after a few glasses I could be sure that they were strong enough. I had the relleno dinner and loved it!! The food here is pretty spicy, but so good that you don't mind torturing yourself a bit. The only thing lacking was the service. There only seemed to be one server but they also weren't busy at all. Also I wish they were open later."}
{"text":"Underwhelming Mexican food and absolutely horrible service.   I have no idea why some people like this place.   The food is all about heat rather than flavorful taste.  Nothing is super fresh, unique or even memorable.    It's like eating Mexican food at Macayo's, which is also mediocre, but adding heat to the food.  To top it all off this was the worst service I've had at a restaurant in years.   I'm talking painfully slow.   No refills unless we asked, no ordering unless we asked, no check unless we asked, and after we asked we had to remind them once or twice.   Good grief it's like they don't even want the business.    This place should become a bar and forget about serving food.   Meh!"}
{"text":"I have not been  here for about 5 years. The service is average. The hot sauce  is really  hot and not for cowards.  I had their  guacamole  which is very good .. I love their carnitas and green corn tamales."}
{"text":"Their chips are OK not great . Salsa is pure heat ,  not much flavor.  The service was good . We were seated quickly . We did order their guacamole which was very good but not a large portion. Their car it as is their best dish. The food did take some time . Prices are above average"}
{"text":"Great food, great salsa, great service.  One of my favorite places to eat in the Valley.  The staff is attentive and friendly and the food is amazing.  Fair warning - if you don't like spicy food then this will not be the place for you.  If you are a fan of New Mexican style spicy food then you will love this place.  The different salsas are bold enough to make their presence known without overpowering the flavor with searing pain.  I really like this place."}
{"text":"The salsas(green & red) at Los Dos are the fire!! I haven't found hotter or tastier salsas at any other restaurant.  I have frequented the Central Ave location a half dozen times. Really cool atmosphere(rumor says it used to be a mortuary) with the courtyard and the intimate dining area. Just not convenient for me at all.  I have only been to the Wash and 10th Street location once but it had the same great salsa and the food is always good. The atmosphere is lacking, but it is a great location to go for dinner before a D-backs or Suns game. Everything I have had is good, but I always end up dumping a bunch of salsa on whatever I order anyway and that makes it pretty great.  I find the drinks are a little pricey, I believe I paid $10 bucks for a decent rocks margarita and $12 for a prickly pear margarita for the Mrs.  In summation the salsa makes this place a 4-star joint."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here Friday and we were impressed.  I'm a wimp when it comes to spice and this place was spicy!  (But that's a good thing!)  We bought a groupon for this restaurant, and we've decided to buy another one!   We shall be returning!"}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos is some of the best New Mexican food in the Valley. These guys and Richardson's (N PHX) are the only 2 New Mexican/Mexican restaurants that I will go to (I'm picky). Their food is very complex spice - very well done - with generous portions.  Do be warned that most everything I have tried is very spicy, which I like. Great beer and margaritas help chill things down.  Do note that the Chandler Blvd location as moved up to Warner. It was still under construction, but the same excellent food we have always been served."}
{"text":"We waited about 20 minutes for someone to take our order and about 30 minutes for our food. Just four of us, over half an hour between ordering. It was busy, but not slammed. It was ridiculous. We asked for the check the second the food finally came out, and...NO ONE EVER CAME TO PICK IT UP so I wandered around the restaurant after another 15 minutes until I found someone to run the card.   We are never going back. The food was pretty good, but not remotely worth the effort and time it took to get it."}
{"text":"They have good chips but the salsa is just pure heat. I love hot sauces but it needs to have some flavor . I ordered their carnitas which h was very tender . . They have me a large portion  . I.  Could only eat half. I l ui ke their whole beans . Service was good"}
{"text":"Have been there many times and enjoyed it but tonight might be the last. We felt as if we where getting ripped off. Ordered the kickass margarita pitcher which is $36 and tasted like just the mix. Discussed this with our server Kyle and he acted as if he didn't know what was going on blaming it on the vendors. Asked if we could get a couple of shots of basic Sauza or Cuervo. Brought 3 out but at end of meal we were charge $12 for each shot!!! Again tried to talk to Kyle and he that that's the cheapest shot they have-BS! He should have told us the cost because we would have said no thank you. Asked for Cheryl the owner and he said they had no management on site and there was nothing he could do. Food was fairly decent but not as good as previously. Side of sour cream came as we were finishing. Overall they have lost good customers that rave and bring all of our out of town guests unless this problem is addressed."}
{"text":"I love this place, my favorite Mexican joint in Arizona. Hours and days are a little screwy, so make sure that the place is open before you go, otherwise this place is awesome."}
{"text":"So I was shopping at Trader Joe's and remembered I hadn't had lunch or dinner, it was now about 8 pm so I broke down and went over to Los Dos Molinos. I had heard it was great food, and as usual, I took that with many grains of salt. Let's say I wasn't disappointed because I expected nothing special - but I did expect it to be edible - it barely was.  To start I ordered a margarita, the house margarita which was almost $10. God awful, so I asked the girl behind the bar to add some 7up to it - then more ice, then more ice, and it was still syrupy, limy, nasty sewer water disgusting. Then came the chips and salsa. Even worse. Maybe \"Authentic\" Mexican tortilla chips are supposed to be as hard as wood-chips, but that's not how I prefer them. Broken teeth is not part of a pleasant dining experience. The salsa was gross,  some smoky-spicy garbage and other green nonsense, nothing fresh or flavorful.   So now I try to salvage this dinner with the guacamole. Mind you, I was starving, otherwise I would have left already. The guacamole was a good size portion and wasn't that expensive (everything else was) but again, it was very bland. I ate it all because I was ravenous.  By now I wasn't even halfway through my margarita when I ordered a beer. I didn't want to soil my dinner with that margarita sludge, and the Shrimp Veracruz looked tantalizing and authentic. So the bartender brings my beer - but doesn't bother to ask about the 2/3 full margarita sitting there. I never touched it again.  The entree arrives, not the biggest portion, but enough, and it looks good. But it was quite bland. I was expecting it to be flavorful, at least spicy, but nope- no imagination or care put into it. This place is quite typical of the Phoenix area - mediocre food with poor service. I can only blame myself for even giving it a try."}
{"text":"The food was ok, very much New Mexican style, which is not my favorite. Tamales were a bit bland. Service was really good, though, it seems like the restaurant nickel and dimed each aspect of the meal."}
{"text":"Best Blue Corn Tamales by far! I first visited Los Dos Molinos with a friend from work and was warned that even some of the mild items on the menu where Spicy. This is definitely true! If you like spice, and I mean real spice with flavor Dos Molinos is for you. They do have some milder items but their Blue Corn Tamales are spicy and quite awesome. Its not in the greatest part of town but its worth the drive. The atmosphere is authentic and straight out of south of the border. Meals and ingredients are all fresh and its a family run operation. I rarely give 5 stars for anything but it is warranted here. Give it a shot and see if we agree."}
{"text":"Spicy is the word to describe the food. Its delicious though. Every person that works there is friendly and is willing to help you.  If you're snobby and meaningless things like a menu are deal breakers and great food doesn't matter then go to a chain restaurant and leave room for true food lovers! I eaten there three times and plan returning several more :-P"}
{"text":"This location is much cuter and has more character than the Mesa Location on Alma School Rd. The staff are friendly & attentive! The chile rellenos are delicious and their salsas are very spicy & flavorful! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place has it all... Family owned, using delicious family recipes!  We enjoyed the pork platter and ribs and expect to be fighting who gets the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Staff made us feel very welcome and food came out fast, hot and fresh.  The atmosphere is unique and fun and we can't wait to return with our family to enjoy a fun dinner!   Be sure to try the seasonal pumpkin flan! It was the perfect finish to our meal!"}
{"text":"Ok... I do not understand the cult following that this place has. I grew up in Mesa and have been dragged to this place several times only to wonder \"WHY?\" The food is ridiculously hot - not yummy hot - just hot! I like hot food but I want food that is delicious and digestable. The service sucks and the prices are a rip off."}
{"text":"This restaurant has quite possibly the worst service we've ever experienced. We arrived about 6pm (early by usually Saturday night dining times) and were seated immediately. The place was about 3/4 full. It was 10 minutes before our drink order was taken and another 20 before anyone bothered to take our meal order. 25 minutes later, just as my patience was at it's end, our food arrived. Both our orders were wrong. When we stopped a server to tell them they took the food away and promised replacements immediately. 10 minutes later as we were getting up to leave the food arrived. My husband said his #6 burro was good but the chicken in my chimichanga was dry and devoid of flavor. The severs never offered a second round of drinks until we were ready to leave. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Authentic and spicy m don't expect usual tex me fair here.  Daily specials sell out quick!  So order them early"}
{"text":"This is our favorite New Mexican restaurant! The food, service and drinks are great! They know us by name and always recommending their specials. We love carne adorvada chimichanga. Totally recommend Los Dos Molinos, they have several locations throughout AZ."}
{"text":"Amazing food every time! By far my favorite restaurant in the valley. If you like spicy Mexican this is the place to be!!!!   My family has been coming here for years and years.  I had my graduation party from Nursing school here a couple of years ago and they took fantastic care of my family and friends down to the very last detail, even offering to customize a special menu just for us. Whatever your needs are they will strive to meet them with genuine kindness! A family owned and operated restaurant that deserves every bit of success that comes their way. Please consider frequenting this establishment next time you're looking for a new place to try. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Mexican is my favorite food and if I was stuck on a desert island with only one choice of food, it would be Mexican food. I'm also a fan of spicy food and I like a little kick. Well, this is the best of both worlds! Now I have been here more than 100 times, but I couldn't tell you about any other dish on the menu other than the Pork Adovada Chimichanga. It's served with rice and beans, guacamole, and sour cream. Nothing here is cheaply made, even the beans, rice and sides are all homemade. Now I said I liked spicy and this is some of the most spicy food I have ever eaten, but it's not so spicy you can't enjoy it (which really pisses me off when some places do that). This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant and always will be"}
{"text":"My wife and I just went here for an early dinner and it was one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to here in Phoenix. There green chile sauce is bomb and I could literally put it on everything! #greenchilesauce #putthatsh*toneverythingman"}
{"text":"Oh all the Los Dos Molinos, I will say that this is the best one. This is the one that I would go to again and again. The oridgenal location was up in Springerville,(AZ) I have not ever been to that one, but have friends that have and all say it too is great. This was a place opened by family. I think that is why it is so good. The name translates to The Two Grinders. The story goes that both the husband and wife had a meat grinder that they brought into the family that had been passed down through the generations. So they decided on that name because, it was cool and it is.  This location is the home (ranch) of an old Cowboy Movie Star. Though I cannot remember his name right now. Ask when you go. It is a great place. Lots of cool decour. The food is nice and spicy. New Mexico style spicy, which is a little different than Mexican style foods. They start you out with some chips and salsa. One Green, and one Red. Both delish, if you can take the heat. The sauses are really good, fresh and tasty. Everything you get there,mmm! Of course they are famous for their Margaritas, the strongest out there, I think. It is worth your time to give this place the once over."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch, early dinner.  They are closed on Monday, which I dicovered last Monday.  Not too much parking space on  a busy day, but this day it was fine.  The food is a bit different. Yes, it is Mexican Food ,but New Mexico , Mexican Food.  They are more famous i think, for the drinks they serve. Though i like the food it is good, I like the more traditional Mexican food. It is just a bit too hot for me. Hey the older you get the harder it is to go spicey.  Service is good, and lots of people love it!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after our amazing hike up Holbert Trail at South Mountain and it was the perfect post-workout treat. Granted, we probably earned all of our lost calories back but that is the point of working out, right? As long as they cancel each other out, we're good!   They let us bring our pooch on their patio which was a major plus! They immediately brought him water and us chips & delicious fresh salsas (red & green). Their salsa is AMAZING. I wanted to drink it. ;) Next, of course we treated ourselves to a pitcher of margaritas! They were a little sweet for my liking but i'm a picky margarita drinker. The definitely cured the craving! And of course, we got an order of guacamole for the table to share --- and it was so YUM! You must get it.   For my meal, I ordered the taco & cheese enchilada combo plate with a side of sour cream. Their sour cream is magical! It has secret spices in it that almost taste like ranch! (won my heart right there!). Overall, I was SUPER satisfied with this meal and went home ready for a nap! I'm sure we'll be back after another great hike at South Mountain!"}
{"text":"This place has really good food and really good service as well. They make it SPICY.  Anything on the menu with Adovada is delicious. The spice here is distinct and not the typical Mexican food spice, it is a hotter more intense flavor.  It is also nice because although the spice is there, it well compliments the food flavor. The chicken Tamales were top notch as well as the salsa. If you can handle spice you need to go here. It is great!!!!!  The place was clean and the service was good.   They also have a very well stocked tequilla bar if you are into that."}
{"text":"Overpriced Bad food, bad service, bad attitudes. The restaurant is very dark and the decor is very bad. The relleno was very soft and mushy which made a soggy mess on the plate. Ordered a taco al a carte and requested that they put a little more cheese and the waiter totally ignored my request. They charge for everything extra. What ever happened to good service? They could do so much better if they wanted to. I will never go back again I gave Los Dos uno Dos thres chances."}
{"text":"Los Dos serves up a mean friggin Chimichanga.   Your choice of meat, deep-fried and topped with guacamole, sour cream and New Mexico green chili sauce.   If this fried burro mecca provided free chip and salsa refills it would get the 5-star Monte!   Great margaritas and brew too!"}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTING. I lived in N.M for a good long time and this food is nothing close. There is no New Mexican or Mexican that would truly think it's authentic. TOO much spice, pepper, garlic and salt. Wonder if the chef knows he's supposed to taste all food before serving it. OR perhaps he has no taste buds left.   The server was nice, although could have had a smile and better customer service. The iPad billing was maybe efficient but impersonal and odd. The decor made me wonder how often they dust, clean or care. This place should be a lot more cheery considering it's a NexMex restaurant decorated outdoors as if it's fun good food inside. Don't suggest eating here unless you're already depressed and don't have much of a palette.   Positive: the meal was only $20 for enchiladas and a beer. Free tri-colored chips and spicy salsa. It's quiet.....due to not many clients."}
{"text":"If you love spicy food this is the place for you! Their salsa is delicious and definitely has a kick! All their food is delicious as well! I recommend for anyone searching for a casual place to get some awesome mexican food!  Also, try the margaritas as well, they're amazing."}
{"text":"Really good, no BS food. Both of their salsas are high on the heat level for an average person. The red is more roasted and the green is spicier. I got the #5 combo, which was a flour tortilla filled with seasoned beef (not ground, more like roast) covered in their green sauce.  Really enjoyed the entree and salsas. The surprise was the beans. These are like the pintos my mom used to make. She's still with us, but has modified her recipe for a more healthy version over the last few years. The rice was great too. You could see and taste the Browning in the skillet.  Tried out their Kickass Margarita on the rocks. Tasty and effective!  Highly recommended if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat!!! The green salsa is amazingly addictive! I visit on a regular basis and I am satisfied with my food and service every time!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in tukee. The frozen margs will get you drunk and so happy. The Wait staff is awesome and I when came here for my birthday they sang and gave us free desert. I always have a great time there and we go weekly! Los dos is where the party is at!!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! My new favorite Mexican restaurant in AZ. Everything was amazing! I Highly recommend this spot to everyone.  Phoenix Foodies Approved!"}
{"text":"If you're in Phoenix Arizona and looking for a good Mexican place to eat, try this place.  Spicy, tasty and friendly services, and reasonable pricing.   Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"Alright I've been going back here and the place has totally turned itself around.  I left a bad review years ago because of the crockpotted ribs and yes I take it back, still though you can't crockpot ribs unless you do it in beer, for taco meat.  Finally I can put this place on my weekly stop of drunkeness.  Yea yea, the street tacos, holy crap smoked carne with mesquite.  These little bastards are evil, also good beer happy hour.  I've never taken a review back and apologized, this is the first, shit happens and I apologize for the bad initial review.  Oh and I invented a burrito over there, I called it the garbage burrito, it's so big that John Holmes wouldn't even throw down next to it.  I'll post a picture of it"}
{"text":"Yo I will be back here for sure great food, great service, great music,great vibe.  Everyone here was cool and my one drink that I had was so strong,that I almost needed to uber home. Thanks Chela for your recommendation on what to order. She was great. I will be back soon that was the best enchilada style burrito that I have had all year!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place  on my way back to the hotel. Place is fantastic! Service was prompt and with a smile. Food was awesome! Ordered the carnitas and was awesome. Slow cooker and full of flavor. Homemade tortillas, a drink the size of my head, real salsa...great place for great food, service and drinks. Well done!"}
{"text":"Booo.... What a freaking disappointment!  Bf and I have been so excited to try Los Dos Molino's, but were severely let down.   Starting with the salsa, it was hot and that was about it.  There was no flavor and no salt.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas with blue corn tortillas topped with red sauce.  What I got was two yellow corn tortillas stacked on top of each other smothered with red sauce with maybe 2 Tablespoons of cheese sprinkled on top.   The sauce had a weird flavor, almost burnt, I can't really describe it. The beans were runny and the rice was dry.   Bf didn't particularly enjoy his chicken burro enchilada style either. I think this place received a lot of hype a few years ago which is the only reason people keep going, because the food is definitely below average.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"After living in AZ for almost 6 years, I finally made it to Los Dos. It was worth the wait. The salsa that comes with the chips is as hot as everyone says it is.   My Wife and I had no problem with the staff. Everyone was helpful and our drinks and chips were never empty for more than a minute.   Our dinners were great. I had the Green Chili Beef Plate and my Wife had the 2 taco combo. We both enjoyed everything. I plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I too was very excited to discover that Los Dos Molinos has arrived in Ahwatukee! The other night I went to check out the place and it's busy.   The signage it up. The paper menu is another story. Worst paper menu I have ever seen. Thin copy paper, crinkled, dirty, recycled from customer to customer.   We walked in and immediately greeted by the bus boy. From the looks of things nothing much changed from the previous owner except Los Dos hang stuff all over the walls and opened. Even the carpet is the same.   Plenty of folks eating, drinking and having a great time. They are on a wait. We sat at the bar had a drink. Wow was it strong..am I really that easy? The bar had a trough of nut-raisin-candy mix. Not a big fan of everyone fingers in the watermelon pot.   The view of the back bar from the cheap seats was very messy and cluttered. I really like the cash register draw that stands along. No cash register...just a calculator and a draw. If you want a glass of water the bartender has to go into the back for it. (really) After observing for a spell we decided on our other New Mexican option in the area.   The patio really missed the mark. No lighting!!!!!!, no music, no nothing just a few smokers. Disappointed. I may go back someday and give them another try but I just don't think this is my kind of place."}
{"text":"Before this was Los Dos Molinos it stood as Padres Mexican Cuisine owned by a father and son. I worked here for one summer so naturally when they sold Padres I returned a few months later to try out the new replacement. When I first walked in I was taken back by all the lights and carefully hung snowflakes (it was December) but it looked beautiful and set a very nice atmostphere to be in. The food was pretty good, not the most authentic mexican food I've had but there were no complaints about it. The same head bus boy from when I worked was still there giving attentive service as always! Over all still a really great place to go for dinner if youre in the area or want to try something new. I only wish that the owner would give in and start having live music every Friday night as Padres did. It makes for a nice edge and always drew tons of people in and of course was always a blast."}
{"text":"I love Los Dos Molinos and have been here a few times but this is my first review.  Not sure why...anyway... from the moment you walk through the patio area to the time you're seated inside, this place is great!  I love all the stuff on the walls and the food...amazing!  I've never had a bad meal here. I haven't had real Mexican food in awhile since I moved and Los Dos once again did not disappoint. This last visit I chose the enchiladas with the fried egg on top, rice and beans. The green sauce is to die for and the rice and beans were absolutely perfection.  My friend had the flautas and they were equally as awesome.  Go!  I wouldn't steer you wrong!"}
{"text":"Freaking great. Red chili or green chili plate. Flour tortillas are homemade. Recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Not really inviting when you walk I there's a sign and the cactus caught my hand the thorn is so small I can't get it out. parking is bleh it has outside patio feel on the out side the inside looks dirty and all the Mexican tile in the floor and table looks hard to clean. The colors of a dirty rainbow exploded well I'll end there we've waited 25 minutes to give our order we had to catch some running by avoiding eye contact the food came 10 after order and its delicious had the Mexican pizza tastes like my grandma made it there pork is well flavored so I can see my self coming back they need more staff I don't under stand why they keep sitting people if there not taking there orders"}
{"text":"A friend of mine, who has lived here over 20yrs with his family, constantly badgered me to get to this place.  Finally, I had a weekend without travel or other plans and I gave in to the drive to Mesa for what was supposed to be awesome food.    THIS FOOD GOES TO 11....  As I have grown older, I seem to be sweating more when I eat hot foods.  The salsa alone made me ask the waiter for a kitchen towel.  Both the red and green salsas packed a great bunch of heat, but not the crappy \"burn the crap out of your mouth\" type of heat.  It was a slow, mellow burn, with FLAVOR!  I knew I was in for a great meal.  I had to order a red chili tamale, and a carne adovada burro.  The chunks of roasted pork reminded me of the best osobucco I had ever cooked.  I cleared the plate and ever since I left the restaurant, I have this yearning to return.  I'm obsessed now... dreaming of when I can go back and eat more."}
{"text":"I liked it pretty well, my wife wasn't a huge fan of the food but I thought it was good."}
{"text":"Went to Los Dos Molinos yesterday and I was impressed with it. Although, as some Yelpers have said the service is SLOW, especially when it was 2:30 PM On Sunday. It took a while to get our food and even a while for someone to take our order. However, our drink order was taken care of right away as soon as we sat down by a busboy. It was OK. I wanted to try the Prickly Pear Margarita, but at $7.25 for a small one, I thought better of it and ordered a soda (ONE Free Refil for $1.75). They did provide really good chips and Red and Green Salas which are HOT. Just how I like it. After we had finished the chips they had asked us if we wanted more chips. I asked if they were free and the waitress said it would be $1.00 extra for chips and $1.00 for salsa. That really irked me :(. But, we ordered and I had the Pozole with Oregano  Chile Pequin mix, onions, lettuce, tomato, and a lime in there. It was $10.50. The Pozole Bowl came out and it was a fairly good size. My wife had the Carne Adovada chimichanga and that was pretty good. Since she chose the Rice & Beans with it it was $12.50 instead of $10.50 for just the chimmi. Hers was good as well and spicy.  **** TIP **** If you \"Checkin\" to Los Dos Molinos on yelp you will receive a free cheese crisp with or without the Green Hatch Chile (We got ours with the Green Chile). It just shows up immediately on your phone if you do and you show it to your waitress and thats it. You get it for free. Just thought id point it out to my fellow yelpers out there. All in all the food was wonderful, the service was a little slow but since we had nowhere to go on Sunday it didn't really matter, but it might matter if you are going to this place for an hour luch as we were there for about 1.5 hours so that could cause some people concern. I DEFINATELY will be back for the NEW MEXICAN cuisine (NOT Mexican) and the Spice. If you don't  like spicy this is NOT the place for you. If you like it HOT this definately should be on your list of eats!"}
{"text":"Was not able to eat there this time, was told a 25 minute wait time, stood at the bar for about 15 minutes, finally was able to order an overpriced margarita, that was below averge. After waiting an hour and 45 minutes, and several inquiries  about  our table,  manager told us they were cleaning off our table and we were next, manager then came and said sorry there was a problem , somebody with reservations would be seated before us. After standing for an hour and 50 minutes holding a baby, this is totally unacceptable customer service. We were lied to and given the runaround, while they seated five or six people below our name on the list.  The manager is very arrogant and has no customer service skills. We have eaten there before, food was decent but service is always lacking. We left very disappointed. We will never return to this establishment or refer anybody to this poorly run business."}
{"text":"Great food with excellent service.   Everything made in-house !!!  Convenient location."}
{"text":"I'm a tad biased having a NM restaurant not far away. But, I'm a old customer of the south phx location. I sensed the bartender was related to Cheryl from s central, turns out her daughter. Wow, when u are raised in the business, it shows in a big way. Great vibe, very right on in a low key manner. I'd go for sure"}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix on our way from the Grand canyon on our way to visit family in Tucson. We looked for restaurants using our car navi system.  We found this little place and we a little our of the way to try. We loved it. The food is very spicy, but love the heat.  The last time we were in Phoenix we wanted to eat there again but they were on vacation. We definitely hit this place next time we are in Phoenix  ."}
{"text":"Have always had a great experience here the food is always delicious.  On this visit the service SUCKED  it was like the server had ADD would bring one thing, drink, chips, salsa, lime then disappears for 20 minutes.  Ask another server to find ours.  10 minutes later no response. Ask another person if we could order.  \"Oh she was waiting for you to be ready to order\".   No obviously wrong since we asked for her awhile ago.   Again food was awesome service not.  As I left in the parking lot a couple mentioned service was awful they were going somewhere else.  Ok here's the odd thing I've eaten there many times. When they were busy and had fewer people working and had BETTER service.  The bus people were more attentive than the servers on this visit.  SAD."}
{"text":"I cannot come to PHX and not eat here!  the food is to die for and well worth the wait. The service is always excellent and I plan trips from CA just so i can eat here!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this spot a lot because the ingredients are fresh and the chile is delicious. If you're not familiar with Hatch green chile and you like spicy food you must try Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"Yes! Muy picoso! If you like New Mexican chile and you like it hot this is the spot.. service is usually poor but the food is worth it.. stick to the items covered in chile but ask for extra because they skimp a bit"}
{"text":"I found this place about a year ago because my girlfriend is from New Mexico and we were looking for New Mexican food around here. The food is amazing, very spicy, but amazing none the less. My girlfriend also said that is the most authentic New Mexican food she has has since moving down here 2 years ago. Although the food is great, my favorite part about coming here is the margaritas. If you stop in make sure to try the \"kick ass margarita\"."}
{"text":"I have been to Los Dos Molinos twice and I must say this is by far one of the worst restaurants around. I went twice to reserve my judgment on this particular location as I have been a patron to their other locations around the valley and I figured that these locations couldn't vary that much. Boy was I wrong.. First the service is horrible, starting with the uncaring hostess who spends more time behind the bar than actually greeting and seating guests. The dim witted servers and bus boys are definitely in a league of their own when it comes to incompetence and the poorly made food from a condensed menu of the other restaurants really show just how little they care about keeping a similar experience from the other locations which are far better managed and busier than this location. Yet again I emphasize this is after two visits with the same experiences at both. If you are a fan of Los Dos Molinos, I recommend going to another location."}
{"text":"Great food everyday and happy hour specials during the week. Reina was the Saturday bartender on duty. She makes a great margarita and is friendly and knowledgeable. I had spicy pork tacos that were so good. If you like New Mexico style Mexican food this is your place"}
{"text":"I love that their food is spicy! I was born and raised in New Mexico, and finding food that is similar to our NM cuisine is a hard find. So this place was recommended to me based on that and that fact that I love spicy food. The service was great. The food was good. I had the beef enchiladas with red and green. New Mexican's don't mess around about their green chile. They say their green chile is from NM, maybe it was prepared a little different than I am used to because it tasted a bit different, (maybe not roasted the same?), but still satisfying. My husband can't do super spicy and there are not too many options for the mild eaters. My husband will most likely not return, but I will! I want to try the adovada. Oh, and I must say that the sopapillas were THE BEST I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Living in phx for 10 years now this has got to be the worst Mexican place I've gone too.  They have weird tortillas that resemble pizza crust but taste like cornmeal.  I ordered enchiladas and they came out like soup with everything piled on top of those gross tortillas.  My gf ordered a wet bean burrito and she asked for medium and it tasted like it was cooked with ghost chilis.  We both like hot but this was absurd!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place. It used to be really really really spicy which was the big draw. Now it's just a kind of awful mexican food place where everything is bland. The one in ahwatukee still has some spice. Please make this restaurant more like the other Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican Food Restaurant. It is New Mexico style which means they use hot Hatch chiles in just about everything. Go here if you love hot spicy food. I have been going here for 20+years and this is the best. Adovada (red chile marinated pork) anything is a sure bet.  Everything here is homemade. Try the Red Chile Cheese Crisp to start and make sure you order sour cream or guacamole to help cool the fire. The have great mexican beer on tap and  huge margaritas. If you are worried about the spice level you can always get regular beef or chicken tacos or bean burritos and spice it to your level with the salsas, red and green provided with chips. I often take home extra salsa, green is my favorite. It is delicious."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food and drinks . The food is delicious! The service on the other hand not so great . Our server kept rushing us to order,  when ordering we couldn't even say what we wanted without him trying to take the next persons order . Asked him 3 times for a box and was told he couldn't do separate checks . When asked if he could itemized our check cause we couldn't read his handwriting,  he said he would give us a menu to figure it out . Very unprofessional in my opinion."}
{"text":"I really like the food but I have a problem with their billing. It is extremely expensive and unclear. Somehow for 2 people,  1 cheese crisp, 2 entrees (1 a chimi plate the other a taco plate) with 1 beer and 1 soda consistently comes to $60. When I finally did the math based on the menu, I come up with considerably less. For those prices I would expect great service a smile. But so far that has never happened.  Service is ruff at best even when not busy."}
{"text":"I am huge fan of Los Dos Molinos in Mesa. Amazing food. Great service. My only complaint is the varying size of the portions. Sometimes the portions are large, other times not so much. That can be very frustrating. Out of the many times I have been there, there was one visit where the adovada was off. It had no heat. But that was only once.  The \"normal\" visit there results in great food and service. Another interesting note is that I used to go the Los Dos on Central, but stopped going because the service was poor and my bill was always mysteriously $20 higher than it should be - consistently. My visit to the Mesa store, ordering the exact same appetizers, entrees and drinks is consistently $20 cheaper. Go figure."}
{"text":"Service was terrible and the food was just OK.  The best thing about this place was the cheese crispi but not worth coming back for."}
{"text":"First time here and so underwhelmed. Haven't been to the original location in years but with all the other exotic Mexican restaurants in the area I will not be back. Ordered the shrimp Veracruz (blech) watery sauce and cheese looked horrible! Not filling either. Kick ass margs taste like laundry detergent. So sorry to report this place is a total disappointment."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Carnitas are fantastic. Good service for lunch.  Love this place!  Authentic."}
{"text":"The posole  here is just like my grandma used to make, A-mazing. The staff here is incredible.  Great ambience and amazing food. A few of my favorites, The garlic burrito Christmas style. Christmas means (red and green chili) the green chili burger and the green chili stew."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today with a group of coworkers.  This Los Dos is pretty big and it was not packed at all for lunch.  Our server was friendly and prompt.  He brought us our chips and salsa right away which of the 2 salsas I really liked the green... It was spicy, but not too spicy.  I think over the course of our lunch I did drink a pitcher of water, but I wasn't uncomfortable or anything;).  I had the 2 ground beef taco's lunch special with a side of guacamole it also came with rice and beans.  They were your basic taco's but still very good.  One of my coworkers got the pasole and that looked pretty tasty to me.  I will definitely have to try that next time, pasole is one of my favorite soups... and it is hard to find places that make it well."}
{"text":"We went today and LOVED IT. The service was incredibly fast, the drinks are HUGE and the food was delicious. I had the grande burro and my husband had the combo plate #6 with machaca, with green chiles. The machaca was absolutely delicious- spicy, but he was able to eat the whole thing! Green chile is spicier than red so next time I might order it with red. We can't wait to visit again when the heat cools off to sit on the patio"}
{"text":"Delicious and my go-to when only a good Mexican meal will do.  The atomosphere is friendly and lively without being boisterous and annoying.  The servers and staff are always friendly.  I love their flautas and their beans!  My only complaint....the salsa is so spicy!!  But I still eat it cuz it's so good!!!"}
{"text":"Love it and it's spicy. For all of you that pause and say \"yeah, I like spicy food\". No, I mean really spicy. Lots of depth of flavor and great daily specials. Calabacitas anyone?  good drinks and overall great...and they make you pay for it....."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for awhile. Needless to say, this place sucked. Sucked in customer service, food was not great, and its overpriced. our lunch took almost 45 minutes to get to our table. I had to get up and have someone come and put our order in and it seemed like they were bothered by it. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ok so. I grew up in Phoenix and I have been to this place a total of 4 times including this visit. Each time I have never had a bad experience with the service or food. So this visit: Went in got seated immediately greeted nicely. Was given our drinks. We ordered our food and it was delivered to our table pretty quickly.   The food:  I ordered the Enchilada Dinner - great dinner Hubs: Chimichanga - spicy but good ate it all Pops: Red Chili plate- great! Ate it all. The chips and salsa of course spicy salsa but continued to eat it.   No bad experience or review. Will be coming back.   The food is SPICY! So don't ask for Mild they Don't Got it!"}
{"text":"Today, Adovada Ribs, pork dry, the beans taste like they have tomatoe paste in them -no-bueno & covered half of the plate, rice-average, flour tortilla is the winner served with one 10 in flour tortilla additional one for $1.50, red salsa average & green is better. Salsa better at Rosita's on 24th St. & McDowell. One ice tea & one Prickly Pear Margarita good but the salt on rim was fine like table salt. Too bad. Cost for this lunch time meal $28 plus a tip."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for dinner about a week ago while I was in town. I was really looking for a chill, not fancy, and local Mexican place around Tempe, but I also wanted a real menu (as opposed to ordering off a wall like a lot of local Mexican restaurants). It is a very cute interior with a fun Mexican decor. I really felt like the service was extremely slow, though everyone was friendly. Just didn't feel as if the margarita I ordered should have taken 15 minutes to come out... Although the service was really not the best I've ever had, their food definitely made up for it. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE SPICY FOOD, DO NOT GO HERE! This food all has a lot of kick to it, from the salsa they provide at the start of the meal, to the sauces on their food. I had the cheese enchiladas and they were DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"We're long-time southern Cali and Denver residents, so we come to Arizona with high expectations after enjoying great Mexican fare on a regular basis. Unfortunately, we have been completely let down thus far. How anyone can rate this food as 5-star or even 4-star is beyond me.The menu and beer selection are meager, and the chile is bland and tasteless, the beans half-cooked, more like South American than Mexican. The tortillas were thick and burned instead of thin and lightly singed. They do have a nice little patio screened off from the Safeway parking lot, and the service was good, but I doubt we would go there again. Strip mall ambience. Where is the good Mexican food in Phoenix?"}
{"text":"Family restaurant. Friendly people. Amazing margaritas. Ambiance fantastic .  Food absolutely delicious. If you enjoy spicy Mexican food this is your place. Would definitely strongly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I'd heard so many good things about this place and was really expecting a great meal, but it didn't happen. We got there early on a Saturday(5:30)- which was good because the place filled up fast. That was the only thing that happened fast there.   We only got one menu that four of us had to share and after about 20 minutes had our drink orders taken. I had a sangria, which was ok, but tasted mostly like grape kool-aid. We got chips and salsa-which was depleted in 5 minutes between four of us. We asked for more and got it only after we asked again.    Three of us got the chicken enchiladas and we all agreed that they were ok, not quite good, and far from great. JD had the special- a chorizo pizza. It was really salty and greasy but the crust was kind of crispy, surprisingly. We got another round of drinks and ordered sopapillas to go. This took forever! I didn't eat mine, but heard that they were worth the wait later. I seriously doubt it. Not planning a return trip here."}
{"text":"Everything about our experience was horrible. The first thing to be bad was why do they put the plastic cheap Denny's water cups lip down on the nasty table cloth? My mouth is supposed to drink out of that cup? I can't imagine the bacteria. Gross.   We had to ask twice for a refill on chips and our water glasses sat empty (which BTW we drank with straws that we requested).   When the bill came, it was on an iPad rather that a hard paper bill. I can appreciate going digital, however at least let me see what I am paying for. It was awkward for the waiter to tell us how much we owe without showing us what we were paying for - and point out how to leave a tip when it was subpar service."}
{"text":"Yup, it's spicy.  I'd say it's just my gringo palate, but the \"locals\" with me were also sweating their brows off.  That wasn't where the problem lay....  The service?  YIKES.  We were 5 minutes late for our reservation and they called to confirm we were coming.  Yeah, ok.  But we arrived to find a mostly empty restaurant.  When our food arrived, the guy more or less barked our orders out wanting to know who had what.  When one of the orders was wrong he asked \"Well, what did you MEAN to order?\"  Uhhhh we ordered it right.  You f-ed it up.  Our waitress asked if we wanted the check.....then left.  I mean left.  After 20 minutes I went to the bar to ask how we could pay.  He told me he also didn't know where she had gone.  But no problem, gratuity was included thankyouverymuch.  Yeah, no thank you."}
{"text":"So the bartender was amazing. Didn't get her name but Amazing. But to the owner, please get away from the Pre Made Margaritas.  They tasted like Lime Gatorade and tequila.  And way over priced for a pre made drink.  We always look for local areas for great food and drinks but a little disappointed.  50 dollars for 4 drinks and one app. Sorry but a one time deal for us."}
{"text":"We have always gone here before and sat at the bar. Maybe that's why the service was good. Tonight We went at 7 pm with five people (2 kids and 3 adults). We ordered guacamole when our water was delivered and we waited so long (like half an hour) that when it came out the waiter comped it and took it off our bill (probably the only reason he received a tip). When  we asked for a kids menu they said we could order off the regular menu, so we did but asked for enchilada sauce on the side because it was spicy. The waiter informed us that if we took off the sauce it wouldn't be an enchilada anymore and that the chef refused to do it (without even asking the kitchen). I'm a chef myself and I have never refused a customer's request unless I just didn't have the product. This request was easy enough - SOS (sauce on the side). EVERY kitchen does stuff SOS - salads, desserts, entrees everything...you guys couldn't?? Pretentious. This was for a child. We were forced to order something else because she was hungry and she barely ate it. The water boy who filled our glasses was more attentive then our main server. We wish we could have tipped him instead. Before our guacamole came out, another waiter came to our table and asked us if our order was taken yet. 30 minutes after we sat down! Don't they have their own sections? Every time we asked for something it was a different person who delivered the product. I've worked in restaurants my whole life as a server and cook and it seemed like it was really disorganized and our waiter didn't seem interested in our party, even though it looked like he had only three tables (wasn't that busy). When they food came out, they forgot the homemade tortilla (which is why this is three stars and not two) and by the time it came, meal was half gone. Even though the food was good, this service just ruined the experience for us. Our waiter was just not accommodating and so disinterested. Which is too bad because until tonight it was our favorite Mexican place in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Horrible.  I did not like this place at all.  It appears that they just want to showcase how hot they can get their food.  Even the regular salsa (which at most places I tolerate) like liking the gates of hell.  I'm currently pregnant and sensitive to spicy foods right now but this was was absurd.  I ordered the chicken tacos and it seemed like the meat was simply covered in black pepper and that was it.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Sopapila stuffed with carne adovada with red and green sauce!  OMG!  Should be permanently!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and even better service. If you are tired of the same old chain Mexican food restaurants, this is your place! We brought our two kids and there was plenty to chose from."}
{"text":"Los Dos Mediocrity. Soo Easy to find better. It was a disappointment from the beginning. The beans and the salsa were not very tasty. That is a big indicator of the quality of Mexican food. If the beans and salsa are good normally everything else is on point. Los betos or Super Burrito are easily better. Service was decent. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Much improved from previous Chandler Blvd location.  Will be back. PS Wait staff could be more on their game."}
{"text":"If you can't stand the heat, get out of Los Dos Molinos.  The food is great, but hot."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! Food was excellent with the right kind of heat. Closest place to the good we have in NM which was right on. Now I know of a place I can come to without slaving in the kitchen myself this place is right on!"}
{"text":"I am usually pretty stingy with my five star ratings, but this place deserves it. The food is consistently delicious and yes, spicy which is how I like it. Warning, even their beans have a little spicy kick to them. Don't go here and ask for something that is not hot, I don't think they would understand. My favorite thing about this place is I dont even get a menu anymore. The servers know what I want. Great job, Johnny and staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a Living Social coupon and so we decided to try the place, but when we went by, the sign on the door said they were on vacation. Bad sign -- we're not from the area and we couldn't get back until after the coupon expired. Management offered to extend it for us, however. which was great because we were then able to try this really good Mexican food.   We both had the Los Dos Flautas special, which consisted of two very large and filling flautas filled with shredded beef or chicken. The beef was absolutely delicious -- just mouth watering, juicy and not too spicy. This restaurant is famous for it's hot, spicy foods so we were happy to find an entré that did not have too much zip. The flautas had a great guac and some very fresh sour cream, along with rather average rice but really excellent beans.   I only wish this restaurant would have a low-powered gringo version of their salsa. Neither one of us could dip their excellent chips into the offered sauce. Too hot by far!"}
{"text":"Great food, neat location. Salsa is fantastic. Worth the wait to get in. Favorite meal is the enchiladas with the egg on top. Everything is good. If you only have time to go to one Mexican restaurant in Phoenix this is the one. Only problem (and the reason I only gave it 4 stars) is that they close the place or go on vacation randomly and even if you call to make sure the place is open they do not update their phone message. We have gone there two or three times and found the place closed on a night they normally are open even though their message said they were open. We have also been to the Mesa and Downtown locations and while the food is as good it is not the same experience as going to the Central Ave. location."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican Food! Los dos is a classic Arizona favorite when it comes to great Mexican food and margaritas!!  Try the carnitas plate for sure! Became, the salsa is the real deal! Super tasty and spicy! Angel is an awesomely server too!"}
{"text":"Perhaps this was just a BAD night but I don't think so.    When we first walked in we there was no one to greet us.  We waited, and waited, and waited and then after about 7 or 8 minutes a young man dressed in jeans (under his but with his boxer shorts showing) without smiling said \"how many.\"  No joke!  We wanted to sit in the dining room but apparently there was some private function going on so they sat us in the bar where the lighting was brighter than the sun.    We then (after about another 5 minutes) were greeted by male server who placed chips and salsa on the table.  And HE TOO was wearing his jean below his but with his underwear in plain sight!  I kid you not!  Overall, the service was poor at best... they were under-staffed and we had to get their attention for everything - water, more chips, more salsa, etc.  Oh, and we ordered a soup appetizer that they served at the same time with our entrees and thought nothing of it.  No apologies, no nothing... whoop, there it is!  Now the food... Wow... so salty and so bad.  I mean so bad that I can't even talk about it.  My meal, the \"stacked enchiladas\" was barely even edible.  I mean so salty it was almost sickening.  Honest.  Perhaps there was a fill-in chef this day because there was clearly a mistake.  And I could go on about the soup and the other meal but it really isn't worth it as it was all poor.  So very disappointed as we were told how great this place is/was."}
{"text":"This place is the best and has the hottest food.  It's well worth the price and the portions are fantastic.  You will not be disappointed.  We recently had the Sangria Margarita and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I really do not understand the reasons for the negative reviews.  Granted I did not go during a busy time but I will review this based on the food alone.  I would say that this place is by far the best food I have eaten.  I've been to the alma school location and I would say that this location will now be my go to spot.  The food is spicy and feels freshly cooked.  If its not on the specials board, ask for the chili relleno burrito.  Perfectly cooked, plenty spicy and worth the price."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. The food was just hot not any other flavor at all. I ask for a horchata and it was water down so I told the waitress to just bring me a lemonade instead. Oh boy bad mistake. Besides her attitude I was stuck with a nasty plate of flavorless food and a horrible lemonade. Just left, never going back!!"}
{"text":"Ok this review has two parts the first one was the ambience and the people near me. It is definitely casual and there were a ton of locals in the place which is normally a good sign. I was dining by myself since I was travelling for work so I chose to ditch at the bar. Bad call. There were two guys also siting at the bar and before I knew it I was deep in conversation on topics that I had no despite to talk about. They kept encouraging me to choose ribs on the menu even though I said no ribs. Secondly they made fun of my margarita  choice and the guy next to me insisted that I try his margarita because he hadn't tried his yet. I said no thanks. He then suggested I use my straw. Ah still not interested. At this point the owner offered to move me but I said I was fine.   Second portion the food. Wow I must say excellent and spicy. Even the chips and salsa gave me the head sweats. I ordered the burro and the owner suggested Christmas style which was half red and half green. Wow excellent again. The green left me wanting more water and more ice while the red did nothing to slow down the sweat firming on my forehead. Overall a great choice for food while in Phoenix. I will definitely be back and most likely will avoid the bar."}
{"text":"Hands down the best New Mexican cuisine in Arizona. Period.  Plus great (kick-ass margaritas!)"}
{"text":"Los Dos has the best New Mexican cuisine in Phoenix, no, wait, the best in the whole of ARIZONA, period! Seriously very good food, always fresh, flavorful, and authentic. My wife and I have been customers for the past few years, and have always found the service good and friendly here, too. The Margaritas can be a little spendy, but even at that, they're worth it. Highly recommended if you like your food good and picante!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype??  The margarita was good.  The chips were good.  The salsa is so hot I can't even taste the \"flavor\".  My guacamole tostada was tasteless.  I had to dump salt on it even to eat the entire thing.  No flavor what-so-ever... I think hot is the only flavor they know."}
{"text":"We saw this place on our way back from South Mountain park and decided to give it a try because it looked like it had a fun atmosphere. We came in and were seated immediately but after 10 minutes or so had not received a menu even though someone had already come by to take our drink orders. We managed to find a few menus on another table and then put in our order. The food was great. My wife normally doesn't like Pork but she ordered some anyway after the waiter recommended it and was surprised. I got the taco salad and it was one of the better ones Iv'e had. On our way out to the car we had some entertainment as a fight broke out between a couple junkies across the street and one of them chased the other down the middle of the road. So the food was great but the location of the South Phoenix one is a little scary after dark."}
{"text":"We were not at all impressed which was a huge let down because we had heard such great things. The food was just OK and frankly a little weird. Maybe it was just too authentic for me? On the plus side the margaritas were great! So if you go get one to make up for the just OK food."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed my trip to Los Dos Molinos.  The atmosphere is pretty casual, so this isn't exactly a great spot to bring a fancy date or hold an important business meeting, but the layout, decor, and ambiance is great for a night out with friends or family.  The place isn't huge, but it's not small, and it's good for most groups.  Anyway, enough about the physical location: what really matters is food.  Los Dos Molinos makes great traditional-style Mexican food.  There's no avant garde inventiveness coming out of the kitchen or anything like that, but they have a huge menu with options for everyone, and the nice things is, if you are familiar with Mexican food, you'll feel right at home in their menu.  The ingredients are fairly high quality and fresh, and the food is executed just about perfectly.  And they make amazing salsa!  The prices aren't particularly low, but they're not bad - about average for this kind of place.  However, when you consider the mammoth size of their portions, two people could easily share a meal, or you could take some home and have two meals.  Not a bad value at all.  Overall, this is a great neighborhood Mexican joint.  They cook up hearty and delicious food that would appeal to everyone.  If you have friends or family in town from a place without a big Mexican food presence, Los Dos Molinos is a good option for showing them some of the great traditional cuisine we are so lucky to have in the Valley of the Sun."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Los Dos Molinos for over 3 years now and we crave it as much now as when we had our 1st meal here.  Personable does not even begin to describe the staff, they are friendly,  attentive and willing to go the extra mile to provide excellent service.    We always bring our visiting friends and family here to give them the \"New Mexican\" flare! Always with glowing compliments.  Our most recent visit was for our Taco Tuesday date night. We ordered the Adovado Tacos with rice and beans and also the Green Chili Stew special to share between us.  The chips and salsa with the duo of red & green (great depth of flavor and different heat on both) guacamole for the chips too. Everything was spot on!"}
{"text":"I tried this place after a co-worker recommended It for spicy food. She was right, the food is spicy! The food was good, however I wasn't crazy about the rice and beans. Tasted flavorless. The service was not great either. I asked for lemons like five times and still never got them. My boyfriend asked the waiter if we could get a receipt and she told him he distracted her and never got us the receipt... However, it's a cute little place."}
{"text":"Great food. Authentic, flavorful and genuine cuisine.  People won't be disappointed unless they're expecting fancy and ambiance."}
{"text":"Holy spicy Batman!  I have heard stories of how spicy this place is and have never really believed it until I tried it for myself.  Let me tell you this, if you don't like it hot your options on the menu are extremely limited but still good.    I went here for lunch with some friends and it was a super chill environment.  Very friendly staff with a fun \"hole in the wall\" type of feel.  I could tell there was trouble brewing when I tasted their salsas on the table with the chips.  Wow.  The spice gave your tongue a numb feeling and the flavor was great which kept you going back for more.  I looked over the menu and almost everything had a little green chili pepper next to it which meant spicy.  Now I normally love some heat with my mexican but i stayed away from a super spicy meal on my lunch break knowing i would probably be in some pain as the day went on.    I chose to go with their Flautas dinner which were two flour tortillas with chicken inside fried to a beautiful crunch.  The chicken was flavorful and moist and the rice and beans made the perfect combo.  I can't wait to go back and try something a little more daring!"}
{"text":"Wow. Impressed with my first visit. Yummy! Hot! Really great food though, flavorful. But hot!"}
{"text":"Great little place a friend recommended. Service is a bit slow, it seems to take forever to get drinks & chips/salsa to the table. Ordered the Pork Roast Burrito served  enchilada style-I chose Green Chili. A tad bit on the oily side, but very tasty. The green chili sauce was nice & spicy."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food on the planet. Pure spicy awesomeness!  John, Raymond, and Maricella make your visit a joy and know what you want the second you come in. Trust me. If you like spicy then you will not find better anywhere."}
{"text":"The Two Grinders. That's what Los Dos Molinos means. The history of how Los Dos Molinos got its name started with a chef named Victoria and her husband , Eddie and these two chili grinders that once belonged to Eddies great grandmother and Victoria's grandmother. Victoria is the main chef here at Los Dos Molinos.  I love a restaurant that has a story like that. Not just history, but an actual story of its beginnings. I had not paid attention to that 'history' on my other visits here. Tonight, I did. Many of the recipes here are incorporated from those same beginnings of those chili grinders some from St. John's and some from New Mexico. If you have ever been to New Mexico, you can identify with how the chilies there are; green and red ... but, often hot. But not just hot, but hot with a lot of flavor.  Los Dos Molinos uses New Mexico chilies and as it states in the history , they don't know how to do mild! That type of sauce doesn't exist here. Don't ask. The food here is some of the best, authentic, flavorful and YES!, caliente!! I have had outside of New Mexico where I landed and built a home after a couple of years in Paris. I now crave those chilies! The specialties are on the front page and have some amazing dishes and many start with slow roasted pork. Tonight my husband and I sat on the eclectic, colorful patio and started with margaritas. Mine : The Villa Rosa , a face sized margarita, frozen with a swirl of raspberry liquor. His: The Sangrita: a margarita with red sangria. Both are big.. both  amazing & perfect for the caliente about to hit our lips. Next we had the Guacamole .. this comes with house made tortillas and is very good , and also a way to cool your meal down. You also get a first basket of house tortilla chips and the red hot salsa that you can truly see the chili flakes in... and a milder , yet, NOT mild, green sauce. Additional chips are a buck more. My meal was a couple of my favorite al la carte items : Cheese enchiladas , they are not truly rolled and they are thicker than what you're likely used to. The Blue Corn Tamale is perfect. I coupled this with the beans , not refried, but true charro type beans. The sour cream here at Los Dos Molinos is different too; it almost has a ranch taste, but again, it's good. My husband had the Carne Adovado Enchiladas. The meat was truly so tender , like melt in your mouth tender. The soft fried egg atop the enchiladas finishes this dish nicely. We left here very full and maybe having the best Mexican meal I've had in Phoenix. It def has given a couple of my other favorites solid competition. Isn't that a great thing about living in the Southwest though ?! The staff here is friendly, ready to assist in any ordering questions and they never let your drinks run dry .. AND, the food is made to order and you can tell in its taste. The Happy Hour is something I will have to return to. $4 drink specials .. Por favor, Si Senor. The only thing that gets me just a little and I would take half a star off , is that Los Dos Molinos seems to make up its own hours! Well, I guess they can! I've tried to take guests from out of town here and find it closed. I've called and the phone has just rung to see if it's open. Now I just ask when I am there : ' Are you going to be open next week ... next month ? Are you going to keep consistent hours?' It's a family run business and I respect the need for time off. It can't be easy being this good:)"}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos is some of the best and most authentic Mexican food in the valley, in my humble opinion. Last week, after having been away for nearly a month for work and for vacation overseas, I felt like my body was in serious withdrawal from not having Los Dos in so long. As my bad luck would have it, the Los Dos Molinos we usually eat at, was closed. I almost wanted to cry , BECAUSE, I was leaving yet again for another two weeks and again, for Europe. UGH!! Well, he found this Los Dos to be open!! We had never been to this location and it was still near our home; same owner and much the same menu, on a smaller scale. The same fiery, hot spicy salsas and house made greeted us and whereas, there are fewer margaritas on the menu, there are some different ones worth trying , like the, 'Hand Shaken'. The wine list is also a little more involved; tonight I had a white sangria that was housemade, refreshing and peachy. I have several favorite entrees at Los Dos but I think my all time favorite are the hand rolled flautas. I always get them in chicken; they are never dry and so filling! These flautas are NOT the skinny ones you see at other places; these are fat, hand rolled and so tasty! I usually eat just one and take one home. The beans are a nice addition. This Los Dos Cafe does not have the same starters like the cheesy Chorizo Queso. But, it's still all you would want from Los Dos. The patio is nice and the bar is larger than the one on Central Ave. The service was on point, just like the other Los Dos and NOW we know... should the other one NOT be open when THE LDM craving over takes me.. there is another LDM option near by!  PS.. Those great margs are on happy hour from 3-6 pm !"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Food was horrible! Worst Mexican food ever. Plus they over charged us! Minus a star!!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Finally decided to put my two sense in on this place.  I've been going here for years and I am never dissapointed.    The food is excellent , the margaritas are amazing  and the salsa is hard to beat!  I'm a fan of both the green and red!  In addition the staff is always super accommodating and friendly.   I always recommend to friends and visitors to the area if they're looking for great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! The food has some heat, but it's balanced with bold flavor and wonderful margaritas."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were on the hunt for some awesome margs & dinner.  Our dinner was amazing!  The food was hands down outstanding!  Their signature adovada is to die for and their sauces are extremely delish.  The house made margs were on point.  Owner was on the floor greeting guests-super nice btw. Everything is made in house.  The place is a classic hole in the wall that clearly every local knows about.  We highly recommend this place & we are committed loyal customers from here forward."}
{"text":"The food at this restraunt was very good!  I normally do not like Hispanic food, but this restraunt definitely catered to my tastebuds.  I will only say that the customer service is very friendly and welcoming, but they should speed it up a bit.  It seemed like they didn't have enough servers there, I think I saw only two."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. great little place. Had a chicken burrito and it was tasty. service was good and the prices were reasonable. Will be back."}
{"text":"Living in Arizona I have become somewhat of an experienced Mexican food eater. Los Dos is a great place to go with your family or on a date. They have awesome chimichangas and the best Kick Ass Margaritas!! I recommend getting a pitcher of your favorite flavor because they go fast!!"}
{"text":"One star too many! I have frequented Los dos in Phoenix several times. This was my 2nd time to the Tukee location and I will never return.  First time was when it first opened. It was okay then but nothing too special. This trip was like something you'd see on a RI show! Walking up should have been our first clue. The patio looked like a junk yard. I get it's chili roasting season but what's with a bench on top of a table, mess everywhere dead plants in pots surrounding the patio just scary gross. The main entrance is now closed off with a sign telling you to go through the patio so ya really could not miss that eyesore.  It gets worse. Upon entering the room is very drab and dark. Only two other tables have folks seated. None looked too happy to be there but hey it's a work night ... Oh no happy hour going in in this place...didn't even see the bar anymore since that room was draped off. Anyway, back to the bad service.  Waiter told us to sit anywhere. Looking around we should have left but figured to give the place a chance if I could. Again, keep in mind, I'm comparing the food and service to the Phoenix location in my mind.  We sit at a table where there's one chair and a bench against the wall. As I sat down I realized there was a cable jack behind me that the cover was cracked off the wall.  Figured I'll be sitting straight the entire time.  Waiter gets us water and hands us some menus and walks away. Didn't even offer if we wanted anything else to drink. He swings back by with some chips and salsa and asks if wear ready to order. Ok, I'll have the beef taco Combo and the bf ordered the green chili beef burrito. Poof, waiter gone.  While we waited I seriously was surfing the web trying to find out if the place had any health violations and what they were! About 20 minutes later food arrives. BFs burrito looks ok. Nothing fancy but not looking for fancy, just good food. Burro is jam packed with beef and the green chili is to be expected fire hot! Ok, taco combo...eh, had much better at filibertos. The beef tasted funny. It was dry and tough and could have been a couple days old. Didn't taste quite right. Rice was even older, I'd say probably 3-4 days old.  Beans were mediocre and the cheese enchilada was all tortilla with melted cheese on top.  I highly recommend to NOT go here. Save your money, save your stomach, save your time!! If you want Mexican, filibertos is up in the foothills or Arribas is down the road a bit.  This place needs to close its doors!"}
{"text":"I suggested we have lunch there because this restaurant was featured on the show: The Best Thing I ever Ate on Food Network,  The tattooed guy (owner) was SUPER friendly, helpful and patient. He seemed to be the only one working on the floor, but he didn't mind us wanting to sit outside (whereas everyone else was sitting inside) or asking questions about their cheese. We ordered a deep-fried bean burrito, tamale, and enchilada.  Both red and green salsas that we got with chips were awesome. The red one was a bit smokey and definitely had a kick to it. The green one was a bit tangier and not as intensely hot as the red.  Enchilada is usually not my favourite, but LDM's enchilada was smothered in a tasty enchilada sauce. The tamale was a bit dry, which was alleviated by having the delicious green sauce over it.  As my boyfriend put it perfectly, \"being nice goes a long way\". We enjoyed LDM not only for the food but the person behind it. Well done!"}
{"text":"We are regulars of the Mesa location, always enjoy it. This visit on Central was really disappointing. Party of four stopped last night, the margaritas were great. Both the red and green salsas were really salty, all four commented on that. I thought it may be the chips, it was the salsa. Usually, out of town guests comment on the heat, but the salt was the noticeable flavor. Wife had a chicken burrito. Bite one yielded a bone and lots of water. Not to be confused with juice, it was water. My green chili dinner was mediocre. The beef chunks were large and the chili had not flavored the meat. The meat had been put on the plate, green chili poured over the top. The meat was dry. nothing comparable to the green chili I have had at other locations. Diner three loved the ribs. Diner four ate the flautas, but said they were bland. Typically in Mesa, people love the food and comment on the heat. In this case one loved his ribs, all loved the margaritas. Maybe we hit on a bad night, but most of the passion I have for their hot food was not fulfilled. These salsas were overwhelming with salt, all four of us commented immediately. We are pretty easy to please, have been eating at Ls Dos for years. We will go back to Mesa, but not this location. There were too many negatives, not much on the plus side."}
{"text":"I read all of the reviews here and although most were not favorable, we decided to give it a go. We are regulars at the Mesa location, love it and will keep going. The food here was good, but the service at the Ahwatukee location is dreadful. Nice hostess, very accomodating. Margarita order was incorrect for both rounds. We ordered the stronger ones and did not receive those on either round. Not a big deal. They apologized both times. Received food, no utensils or napkins. We sat there and looked at our food for quite awhile. This should not happen, ever. Very difficult getting water here. The sauces are hot, water requests should not be difficult to fulfill. The other locations give you a pitcher of water, this place has decided against that. We waited forever to place our order. We finally flagged down the waitress who got our waiter. It is just really bad service, non existent. They are all friendly enough, just not accomodating.  The staff here really needs to go to a different location and see how to take care of guests. The food was fine, but a dining experience is more than food. Do not deliver food without utensils. If drink orders are incorrect and you acknowledge that, offer to correct them. Keep water full. Check on guests after they receive food, do not dissapear. Staff your restaurant a bit heavier on Saturday night."}
{"text":"If you don't like garlic or spicy heat then this is not the place for you.   Upon reading some of my my fellow Yelpers reviews, I see that slow, disorganized service has been a sore point for them. Our experience was the complete opposite. We were warmly greeted, seated immediately, had our order taken promptly, our food arrived from the kitchen quickly and our severs were very attentive.  The complimentary chips were served with a green and a red salsa. Both salsas were zippy, but not excessively so, with nice balanced flavors. We ended up going through two bowls of each because I smothered my burrito with salsa, yum! The only downside was that the chips were pretty and multi-colored but right out of a bag. Give me monochromatic chips right from your fryer and you will have a friend for life!  We all ordered burritos (burros in AZ?). I selected the plain chicken one which was fabulous. The chicken had been stewed until it almost melted like butter in my mouth.  I had a close encounter with a whole clove of garlic and a small bone but successfully avoided a crisis with each of them.   The portion sizes are humongous! My husband and I could have easily shared one plate and still left very full. Even our ice teas were served in what looked like 40oz glasses!   We are looking forward to returning to try their adovada ribs. If they do something about the tortilla chips and watch the bones Los Dos Molinos will earn 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos is always a treat.  I've had the chance to visit all their locations in the Phoenix area. The Mesa and South Phoenix restaurants never disappoint.  The green and red salsa are both HOT (really, hot) so be prepared. It's a welcome change from some of the milder restaurants in the area. This isn't Macayos. If you don't like spicy food - steer clear.  I recommend the beef tacos or the enchilada platter (it comes with an egg on top to help cool your mouth down).   The employees are extremely friendly.  Great experience every time.  Bon appetite."}

Our waiter was not friendly (said we can't have one soft shell and one hard shell on taco platter), didn't care we were there (didn't check on us until we were done w meal), and just have me a bad feel for this location where I won't go back.  Nice job!"}
{"text":"We have been going to the other Az Los Dos locations for 15 years... This one has some logistics to work through but the food still rocks! We would come back - def make reservations for dinner if you plan to go- bound to get crowded once people know it's here"}
{"text":"Its NEW MEXICAN food, but better than most Mexican places.  The Food is spicy, but Excellent The Service is good. The Atmosphere is great, but casual.  Chimi's are my favorite, Guac is the best in town. Adovada is also very good here. Oh and don't forget the drinks  The only complaint would be the water here is not filtered, but just order the lemonade (superb) or a Margarita (also superb)"}
{"text":"Here's the good, bad and ugly. You can't be in a hurry and don't make any plans until you're done with lunch or dinner. As long as you are not in a rush it is still worth the visit. The food is authentic and spicy. They are understaffed and don't have the time to spend on customer service. They desperately need a manager who can come in and sort out staffing issues and efficiencies. Great food, just bring your patience."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night with our son's baseball team. With a 10 minute call ahead they were able to seat about 20 of us right away. The drinks were the hit of the night! Our friends ordered margaritas and loved them. I had an amazing sangria and then a second frozen sangria. Yum!! The food was highly praised by all too. I had probably the best chicken Flautas ever. My son was a bit disappointed in his bean burro because the beans weren't mashed as he likes, but said it was still good. The prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was perfect for a large bunch of noisy high school boys"}
{"text":"By and far the best Spicy/Hot food I've ever had. The perfect mix between hot and nom. The drinks are huge and sooooo good, two will knock you down good. You get about exactly what you pay for, any higher in price and it would be \" a little expensive\". Once  again, NOM"}
{"text":"Rude service.  The waitress didn't say hello or asked what we would like to order.  She just walked to our table and stood there with pen in hand and a nasty look on her face.  I enjoy spicy food, but this was just too hot to enjoy.  Even if the food was wonderful, I will still never come back because of the terrible service."}
{"text":"As with many things...its never quite as good as the first time.  The food was fine and our server was fantastic.  We sat in a different part of the restaurant than I was used to and it was great.  It was like we were in our own private dining room.  Is it the best food I have ever eaten?  No.  Is it the best? No.  It is exactly three stars."}
{"text":"Love this place. The red chili burrito is my favorite goes best with an ice cold beer. If you like authentic Mexican food then this is your place."}
{"text":"The only thing that this Los Dos Molinos has in common with the Los Dos Molinos in Ahwatukee is the name.   The decor in this location is far more upscale - like a day at the ranch meets Dia de Muertos. We sat at a nice table in the back and immediately received a basket of fresh chips with green and red \"holy f#%k that is hot\" salsa. The other location served us bag chips but with a lot more palatable salsa.  To make a direct comparison between locations I ordered the exact same thing, a chicken burro with a side of rice. The difference was huge, literally. The burro I received in Ahwatukee was the size of a swaddled baby whereas this one was at a minimum half the size. It was still a big enough portion for a typical adult, but I sure didn't need a doggy bag. My rice on the side was over cooked and crunchy. Because the salsa was so unnecessarily hot I did not want to use it on my food even though it kind of needed it. My husband's adovada ribs were delicious but he did not receive too much meat on his plate. We ended the meal with some sopapillas which were quite tasty.   Service was extraordinarily attentive at times but then we went through periods of being ignored. I am not sure that this place is worth a revisit. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Best food my husband and I have ever eaten. Hands down. Carnitas are to die for. Margaritas are HUGE. (the small is easily cereal bowl size)"}
{"text":"Best New Mexican red or green chili outside of Albuquerque by far. Unless try is the green chile stew or the pork ribs rub with red chili. Sopapillas with honey for dessert to help find the chili wounds from your meal. Lol"}
{"text":"Only giving 1 star because you can't do anything less.  The service is bad. Took an hour to get our food and it was cold, as if it had sat the whole hour that we waited for it.  No flavor, not even the salsa.  It was short of disgusting.  What a disappointment.  Not even the fact that we were starving made it taste good.  Thumbs all the way!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this restaurant since 2002 and it's my favorite Mexican food in the valley. The owner has always treated us like family every time we come in. The food is delicious and worth the prices they charge. The kick a** Margarita's are delicious and will certainly kick your a**!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Outdoor dining is magical. The chili relleno I had was excellently prepared with chicken and the salsas are amazing. Enchiladas come with a fried egg on top that makes the meal amazing."}
{"text":"The salsa is probably the only reason to go here, the service was pretty good too, lot of water and chips refills.  The food is mediocre I would say but alot better than places that end in \"tos\".  I go back just for the salsa and the fact that pretty much every mexican food place in AZ is not that good at all, so Los Dos wins."}
{"text":"Always good after many visits over the last ten plus years. If they have the pumpkin empenada you must get it.  The slow roasted garlic pork is amazing and even though I haven't had it for years after going vegetarian I still recommend it to everyone who accompanies me to Los Dos Molinos.  They all love it!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this location numerous times and would try to remind myself to go there when out with friends, but just never seemed to get around to it...until last week!  This location serves up the same great food as the other locations, but isn't as busy.  I will definitely come back.    If you are looking for the atmosphere of the one on Central, you won't find it.  It's more like the one in Mesa, but even toned down a bit compared to that one.  Go for the food!!!  The service was great and everyone is just as friendly so what are you waiting for?  Get in there and eat some food!"}
{"text":"Loved the service and atmosphere as much as the food, as we enjoyed margaritas and an OGC cocktail out on the patio. Had to have enchiladas de pollo with blue corn tortillas, and others stuck to favorites of green chili stew and adovado burrito. A favorite with our friends who are regulars and with us every time we come to Phoenix."}
{"text":"OMG.  The best authentic Mexican food.  Spicy - yes.  If you can't hang, don't go.  But it is darn good."}
{"text":"OMG, blow my socks off.  The number 3 with green sauce will make your mouth smoke...in a good way.    The best authentic mexican food in ahwatukee.  Spicy - yes.  If you can't hang, don't step in the door."}
{"text":"All Hail Los Dos!  I love this place.... but don't come here if you are looking for service or to get in or out in a prompt manner.  Come here for the food:  The absolute best Mexican in Phoenix.    Their salsas are great, although the red was a bit salty for my liking. Highest recommendation to the green chile smothered pork burrito which is a house special probably 3 days a week.  Man it is good.  Most of the food is super super (super) uber spicy.  The Garlic Shrimp over rice is one exception... even the tacos have some heat to them.  During the summer, it is a bit of a pain in the arse to come here... the restaurant is cramped, so you have to wait outside.  Also, don't come here on Sundays, the place is closed.  We've eaten here with a newborn, and the staff treated us very well.... in fact he really enjoyed looking at all of the chili pepper lights on the ceiling."}
{"text":"Still delicious! They need to work on some softer, better tortillas but love the happy hour chicken street tacos $2 ea. Get them double wrapped or they fall apart. Also enjoyed adovado rib entree."}
{"text":"My husband and I are here most Friday nights. The food and service are amazing. We have been to a few of the other LDM and this is our favorite. Tacos are amazing, enchilada outstanding and my husband says the posole is the closest he has found to what he had growing up. I have tried most everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed yet. Ohh!!  If you are under the weather MUST HAVE green chile chicken stew."}
{"text":"Long day at the Office.  On my was Home, I Ordered 2 Dinners To GO for a Well deserved Friday Night TV Feast.   I stayed away from the Hot Items because  I prefer a Mild Spice and ordered the Garlic Shrimp$13.95.  The Shrimp were Nice size and  perfectly cooked in a gravy that was way too heavily black peppered.  The second Item was the Rellano which was Delicious but small.  Obviously, You need a thick wallet to leave full.  Perhaps, I was still hungy because the left out the Tortilla's in My Order.  Had a discovered that they were missing prior to leaving,   I would have gone back as Tortillas may have been the missing link to the Entree's desirability.  John  Phoenix, AZ"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed our 1st experience at los DOS molinos Mesa food was outstanding great spice everything that reminds us of home in Southern Arizona will be coming back again and again"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while driving by and so glad we did the food was delicious ! I had the flautas with their guacamole and sour cream and rice ... amazing . The service was excellent as well I will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Loved this place. My son had been telling me about this great New Mexican place he had eaten at. Finally went with him last weekend. I will be back! Just really good homemade food. A little hot and spicy. Thats a good thing though. Had the pork buritto with red and green sauce. Really, really good. The beans were beans. Not mush. Very tastee. Great staff. Ate at the bar. The bartender was great, serving me an ice cold Modelo draft. Highly recommend if you like our food spicy."}
{"text":"After my fiancé heard about Los Dos from his brother, we started coming here and absolutely love it! My fiancé's parents make great Mexican food, so he is really picky and will rarely eat Mexican food out, but he loves this place even more than me, so that's how I know it's good ;)   Los Dos has amazing margaritas, but beware - they really are so strong! The first time we came I drank one and a quarter De La Rosa and had the worst hangover ever lol. They are super tasty though. Now I just stick to the Fresh or House Margarita (I recommend House if you don't want anything crazy).   To eat, we often get the Chorizo Dip to start, it's so good and is actually really spicy, but we love it! For dinner, my fiancé usually gets the Adovada Burrito Dinner which he's obsessed with, and I get the Shredded Beef Chimichanga (I LOVE chimis but I feel like they're hard to find since most places are really just taco places). This last time though I got the a la carte tacos - one chicken and two beef - and they were really good! I will say I wasn't huge on the chicken because it seemed very plain, but I loved the beef.   Our one complaint about Los Dos in the past has been the service, as our waiters have often seemed a little unfriendly and maybe cranky, but on this last visit we had Scotty, who's new. We loved Scotty!! He mentioned he has a lot of restaurant experience before coming to Los Dos, and you can tell. He was so friendly and polite, someone I would love to see there again!   Overall totally love this spot, definitely my favorite Mexican restaurants in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Another visit to our home away from home. Can't believe how many years we have been coming here. The Red and Green Chile and frozen Margaritas keep us coming back.   I am not a fan of the \"chain\" restaurants, they cater to a different crowd. This is a place that is not for everyone, but as their slogan says, \"Those that like it Hot!\" This is the place for me.   Still good after all these years !"}
{"text":"Yum, I have been a \"lifer\" of the Mesa Location for many years and have visited the South Phoenix and Springerville locations now and then. I had hoped for a good experiance and I got it. The food was a bit different from the Mesa location but still very good. It still beat just about any other mexican restaraunt I have been to. When Mesa closes down during the summer for its break, its nice to know I have a backup plan."}
{"text":"If you like hot and spicy, look no further.  Los Dos Molinos was a place somewhat discovered by just driving by on our way back from South Mountain Park.  The place had a festive ambiance to it so we decided to give it a shot.  The food did not disappoint.  As I mentioned, if you're into spicy flavors, this place has it.  I had the enchiladas with red sauce which was a great selection.  Service was also top notch.   Had a great experience here and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Other than the place being a little dirty I would have to say it's one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to in phoenix. The desserts are to die for. The margaritas are stiff and tantalizing. I think they are going for a bit of grunge look, I'm just not into that style. I would return."}
{"text":"We have a friend who said the salsa is way too hot. All I heard was \"you must try Los Dos Molinos\". We love spicy food and are always up to a challenge.   It wasn't very busy when we got here so we were seated at a large booth in the middle. I started with a margarita and normally in flavored frozen margarita you often wonder if they forgot the tequila. Not here, wow it had quite the punch to it. I'm excited to find a place that can make a great margarita without skimping on the liquor.   Yes, the salsa is hot and yes, you're going to hate it if you don't like spicy food. But, that's just the way it's gonna be. They bought two different varieties, a green and a red. I preferred the flavor of the green.   My favorite thing to order in a Mexican restaurant are taco salads. The only thing that I found a little disappointing was they didn't have any dressing for the salad. I prefer a little Italian dressing with mine, this is the first place I've been to that didn't have any dressing options. The salad was good, but not great.   The service was awesome. Everyone really seemed to be working as a team to pitch in and make sure we have everything we needed."}
{"text":"SPICIEST SALSA EVER!!  I have never left a good salsa bowl empty at mexican restaurant, but I could not finish their salsa.  It was very good, but VERY spicy.    Enchilada was really good as well, but pretty pricey.  I would probably return frequently if it was more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Completely over priced for what this is. Food is extremely hot to cover the lack of any type of flavor. Pitcher of beer prices are decent. Go somewhere else... this place is lacking in taste, service and quality.."}
{"text":"In the 90's I worked at the old Motorola plant on Broadway and Dobson so we would come here for lunch all the time.  This is my go to place for Mexican food in the area.  The red and green salsas are consistently good and the food quality is consistent.  Our party ordered almost everything on the menu and we were all happy when we finished. I've eaten at the Springerville and So Mtn locations but I prefer the Mesa location.  Next trip to Phoenix, I'll try the Chandler location.  Thanks yelp for the complimentary appetizer when I checked-in."}
{"text":"Atmosphere...Dirty. Tacky. Poorly Lit.  They had half of the restaurant closed...but for no apparent reason.   Service...mediocre, at best.  The bus boy and bartender were great, our waitress was one of the worst I've ever experienced.  We had to ask three times for silverware.  Seating...We had a party of 7, and were sat at a table that was meant to seat 4.  They added extra chairs, but never thought to push an extra table up, even though they weren't even remotely busy.  Drinks...Good.  Strong and tasty.   Food...Spicy but cliche.  Nothing that really sets them apart, adding some extra chiles does not an amazing meal make.  The \"fresh\" chips were burnt and rancid.   I've had better food with exponentially better service nearly everywhere else. I doubt I'll be back, especially not to this location."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the guacamole tostada along with the kick ass margarita!  A great meal - the food is pretty spicy but I am happy with that."}
{"text":"Our annual sister visit to Los Dos, where we are treated like family. Great food and margaritas."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food, because we didn't get any.  We showed up at about 6:30 last Saturday night and were told there would be a wait of 30 minutes or so.  No big deal, even though the restaurant was not at all crowded.  The only place to wait was outside on the patio.  Again, fine, and typical for a Phoenix restaurant.  There were other people out there as well, enjoying beers and margaritas and what not.  So I start looking for the bar....can't find it.  I ask the host where I can get a beer...he tells me it's impossible, because \"that part of the restaurant won't be open for another 20 minutes.\"  What?  People who have written about the uncaring, arrogant service are exactly right.  What kind of restaurant, particularly a Mexican restaurant, won't let you buy a beer on a Saturday night?  How did these other folks get served?  We decided it was too strange, and left and went to Frank and Lupe's in Scottsdale....had a great meal and good service."}
{"text":"Los Dos has the best green chili north of Hatch, New Mexico. The margaritas are insane and delicious, be sure to Uber after drinking one.  This would have been a 5 star but since expanding the service has slowed and the food has become a bit less authentic but still a good place to eat."}
{"text":"If you enjoy really spicy food it does not get better than Los Dos. This location is my very favorite. Staff are extremely friendly and attentive, food is consistent. The only bad thing at all is that they are closed Sunday/Monday so if you get a craving those days then you have to wait. My personal pick is anything with the Adovada. It's phenomenal."}
{"text":"I have been here in the past and this trip will be my last. I ordered the Machaca Chimi there was a whole lot of tortilla and not much of anything else. The chimi was $10.50 and the rice and beans were another $2.50. There was virtually no meat in the thing at all. Just a lot of spice and sauce. The person I was with ordered a bean tostada and a taco. The beef taco was nothing more than beef fat and lettuce. Gross was an understatement. The tostada was literally pinto beans from a can dumped on top of a store bought tortilla with some lettuce. No cheese, spices anything. We went there for lunch. The bill was $27.00 not including a tip.  I love spicy food but this place is crazy. Everything is super hot in an effort to burn your taste buds so you can't taste the food.   Don't waste your money at this place. Anyone who recommends it is doing so based on the way they used to be. They are no longer a good place to eat."}
{"text":"In an attempt to induce labor when I was overdue I resorted to trying to spicy the baby out.   While this food didn't induce any labor - it was so delicious.  Yes the service was slow - yes it was quite crowded and the establishment doesn't have a ton of tables - but it was a worth it.   The food was delicious.  I  ended up with the adovado ribs and they were spicy and amazing.   My fav part was the tortillas tho - they're thicker than normal and seem oh so full of gluten.  I love gluten."}
{"text":"If you love great margaritas & spicy mexican food you will LOVE Los Dos Molinos! The service isn't the best, but the food definitely makes up for it. The downside is they are closed on Sundays & Mondays."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and this is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area.    Word for the wise.  As others have mentioned, food here is very HOT and SPICY.  If you do not like HOT and SPICY food (or your guest(s) do not) do not go here.    The food is excellent.  They've got some great pitchers of house Margaritas.  And the salsa (especially the green salsa) is fantastic (and spicy).  They do charge for refills on chips and refills on salsa, FYI."}
{"text":"It was a rare cloudy day in Phoenix when I visited this place. I was hoping to try what I had been told is some of the spiciest Mexican food in town.  I went despite it being in a dangerous part of town.   My friend and I arrived and the patio looked like a garage sale full of random colorful items cluttered about. Inside was a bit claustrophobic with low ceilings and decorations strewn about the walls.    The tables had odd warnings about children and drink refills that did not seem fitting for a sit down restaurant.   I ordered the Chile relleno plate.  After time our chips and salsa came. the chips were think, heavy and cold. The super hot salsa was not very spicy at all and apparently you only get one bowl as we never received any more, also quite odd for this format.  Our meals came and I was excited to try a spicy Chile however it was quite mediocre lacking much cheese filling or on top. The rice and beans were quite standard too. I would have enjoyed some salsa to put on my rice however they never bought any more.  We paid cash at the front cash register as the waiter will not handle your bill.  Overall this place seemed overpriced, low quality and a bit low brow. Go try Serrano's or Arriba for a better meal."}
{"text":"There are controlled burns, and there are wildfires. Los Dos is the latter. My wife accurately described this place as being both the best and worst experiences she's had at a restaurant. The food was delicious, but the burn was ridiculous!  My boss has taken many pregnant women here (who are on the cusp of delivery), and after eating the spicy food here, nearly every single one went into labor (not immediately, of course, but within a day or two). Pretty wild.  My only complaint is with the service being a little lousy/forgetful. But on the other side of things, the owner did come by and help and chat for a while.  Be aware, you can still eat here if you can't handle spicy food. Just avoid the salsas at the beginning and you'll likely be okay. Order an horchata just to be sure. But one thing is certain, you've got to try a plate with adovada ( marinated pork), especially when a fried egg is included. One of the best mexican-style plates I've ever had."}
{"text":"It's crazy I forgot to review this, so here goes ...  I could sum up my review of Los Dos Molinos by a statement the slightly intoxicated gentleman sitting next to me blurted out on my 1st visit here. And here goes:  I just saw Jesus in my beans.  Done.  Well, the beans he almost saw Jesus in were those on the plate of the Adovada Ribs. Hot. Hot. Hot. Way too delicious.  Not the ribs dish you're envisioning, you create mini burritos with this dish of spicy deliciousness.   A local favorite. An out-of-towner never forget! I always go back whenever I'm in town...  Tell Jesus HI ... ;)"}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was a kid. Every time I come back for a visit, I must come here at least once. The margaritas are great, the food is great....what more could you want?"}
{"text":"I think I have found my new favorite Mexican food establishment. And it's close to my home. And it has good tequila. And the food is SPICY. And it's delicious.  When I have to do a shot of 1800 to kill the burn from the salsa, it is my kind of place! And the so papillary with everything are phenomenal.  I am hooked.  That is all."}
{"text":"The  menu is limited. The tacos are soggy and tasteless, the side of guacamole is extremely small and cost 4 dollars. not returning go to Richardson's."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Ribs are unbelievable, but be sure to ask your server for off menu specials.  Kick ass pitchers are amazing"}
{"text":"This is the first, best, and favorite Los Dos Molinos.  The meats are all so perfectly cooked, tender, and flavorful, it blows my mind.  The spicy sauces and salsas aren't just hot for hot's sake, even to a wimp like me, the heat comes with such depth of flavor and mastery that it can't really be directly compared to ANY other restaurants.  Try this place, and see what I'm on about!  Hint: the adovada dishes will change your life."}
{"text":"Ok... The \"Fresh Margarita\" is awesome the green chile stew is too good to simply be called stew... Save the typing and just eat this as soon as possible... Great spot."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Any time a visitor or family member comes to town, I bring them to here to eat. Every single person has enjoyed the experience and loved the food.  The staff is incredible and always friendly.  I would recommend eating here, or any of the other locations they have in the Valley. I am fortunate to have one so close to my office."}
{"text":"Well this was our first and last time here.  The rice was undercooked and crunchy and the beans were very bland and smelled funny.  The salsa was good, honestly I expected more spice!!! Not the case.  We were never checked on during the meal until the very end. The music they were playing was of great variety!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was even better. They saw us coming from the window and had a table ready with a high chair for our little one. Made special dishes for a couple of our pickier eaters and everyone enjoyed everything put on our table. The entire meal was perfect. The guacamole was delish, my shrimp was cooked perfectly and had the perfect balance of spice and flavor. You could feel their enthusiasm for their food and service. What a treat!"}
{"text":"Terrible and unorganized.  I think everybody was excited to have Los Dos in Ahwatukee but after giving this place two chances I'm over it.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"i really wanted to like this place, i really did. Its a Friday and we expected it to be busy, but aside from one large party, there were many empty tables. We sat down and were more than a little surprised when we had to wait for the waitress to walk by us four times and start setting the empty tables before the bar tender came over to give us menus.   We went simple: beef tacos and enchiladas. Honest to goodness, taco bell beat these tacos. They had hardly anything in them. I'm sorry, but if I wanted to eat an empty taco shell I could have done that at home. The enchilada sauce was unimpressive at best.  What really got the raised eyebrow was the $26.00 check. No drinks, no appetizers. Just one terrible taco plate and one mediocre enchilada plate.   We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've never written a review before, though I definitely read them when I'm looking at trying a new place!  However, I couldn't wait to get home tonight to write a review for Los Dos Molinos in Mesa.  I have been going to this restaurant for over 20 years, though I haven't been in a long time.  My boyfriend and I drove quite a distance to get here.  Bottom line, everything was horrible!  We ordered \"kick ass\" margaritas - they were fair.  For dinner, we got the adovada chimichanga with the green chili sauce and the red chili beef plate.  The chimichanga was soggy, not crispy at all, and the waiter, who was one of the family members, told us the green chili is hot.  There was NO spice to it!  And the soggy tortilla was absolutely unacceptable!  The red chili beef plate didn't scream \"Where's the beef?\", it screamed, \"Where's the red chili sauce?!!!\".  And the flour tortillas were the worst we have ever had.  They were the thickest tortilla we have ever seen, and they were so overcooked, that most of it was inedible.  They were stale, hard, and way too thick.  We were hungry, so we ate what we could.  When the family member finally came over and asked us how dinner was, and we relayed to him how awful it was...and handed him the inedible tortilla, which he made a grimace, he did absolutely nothing!  We were SO disappointed!  One of the things I was surprised about when I walked in was that at 5:30 on a Friday night, the restaurant was mostly empty.  Previously, years ago, when I had gone, you would wait for over an hour for a table, and it was worth it!  Not any more!  Don't waste your time or your money!  We will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying the Arizona staple known as Los Dos Molinos. Yes, it is not traditional Mexican food, its actually New Mexican style. However, if you live in AZ, eating at Los Dos is a must!  Went with my husband to this location on our first visit. Normally, this is not the type of place that I would eat at. This particular location appears to be in an old car windshield repair building. However, the inside is clean and cozy. My only complaint really is that the some of the tables (such as the one we sat at) are really large and if you are sitting across from people, it feels like they are miles away! The second time visiting Los Dos was at their new Ahwatukee location. I enjoyed this location very much. We went on a weeknight and there was live music. Not only that but the location is new and really nice inside.  Now on to the food. I think it says something about the food when I say we went there a second time. The first time we went, I had the tamale and taco combo. Although spicy, the food was absolutely delicious. Yes its hot but its not super hot to where you can't taste the flavors. Both the salsa's were hot although I think the green is a little milder because there is more lime in it to tame it down. The sauce on the green corn tamale I had was very spicy but tasty. The tamale itself was good although I prefer mine a bit on the sweeter side. It really is preference though. Some people don't like sweet green corn tamales and if that is the case, the one at Los Dog is probably perfect for ya. The taco was delicious and not super spicy although you can tell that there is some spice in the meat. The husband has had the chimichanga with the adovada twice now and has really enjoyed it although he said that he was crying the first time he ate it due to the spice. The beans and rice are decent although they are really just there for the \"cool down\" period. The beans are whole pintos and although they taste good, I prefer refried. I especially would have preferred refried on my second visit when I ordered the tostada )it comes with the whole pintos). But to each his own, it really depends on preference.  I think Los Dos is a very good place with terrific New Mexican food. However, if you are not into spicy foods, its probably best for you to steer clear. They manage to put spice in everything it seems...  A tip: The Ahwatukee location has a special I believe on Wednesday that is a bucket of beers for 10.00. It actually seems like a good deal."}
{"text":"Meh!!!  I really wanted to give this place 1 star, but there was something I did like about this restaurant...... the diet coke! lol  I can get over bad service, which we did have, but the food was bleh! Way too spicy and pretty small for the price. I ordered a beef tamale and beans. The tamale was about a third of the size it should be and looked like someone had slapped it on the plate and put hot sauce on top to cover up the job. I am not a fan of whole beans, I like 'em refried. So, after burning my tongue and trying to get full off of the greasy chips I gave up.   We actually had to go and get food somewhere else after we left. We were still hungry because most of our party of 5 did not eat the \"food\" we were served. I definitely will not be back.   ps... they charge for soda and iced tea refills! I knew when I read that on the menu I was not going to be happy with this place."}
{"text":"THE MOST AMAZING CHIMICHANGAS EVER!! Chimi with machaca beef and red sauce is awesome. Service is great. However, they should have paid ME $21 to drink the margaritas... waste of money. Not a deal breaker though."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 4 stars just based on the food, but the customer service was absolutely horrible today. In addition they thought our party didn't pay enough when in fact we actually paid and left the waitress a tip. they really need to learn how to use a calculator or update their point of sale system. Don't get me wrong the food is delicious, this experience cemented that we will never visit this location ever!"}
{"text":"Always classic; Los Dos Molinos is an icon. Their food is amazing, and everyone there has always treated my wife's food allergies with greatest care.  Just be prepared to answer red or green."}
{"text":"I feel horrible for giving them a bad review. But I need to warn people. I've been extremely sick the day after eating here. Two times now. I shouldn't have given them another chance last night. The horrible service, and mediocre food that is way too spicy to even be edible, is just not worth being sick the whole next day. I'm sorry. Gave this place multiple chances but I will never be going back."}
{"text":"What a gem in Mesquite. We stopped here for lunch and we both had a great meal. I had the Chili Verde and she had the steak fajitas. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. They have a salsa bar and the chips were fresh. We wanted for nothing."}
{"text":"Went there the other night, had the carnitas, which I thought was well prepared. The pork was fork tender and the sides that came with the dinner was also tasty. My father had the garlic shrimp which he thoroughly enjoyed, kudos for the shrimp and carnitas!!!!"}
{"text":"I am from Ohio and this surpasses everything up there seriously. If you are in Phoenix and you think you like Mexican food, you better stop here and get a reality check! 5 stars all day long."}
{"text":"Our lunch was great! We're not from here but had friends tell us to try it out. We loved everything we tried. I had a #6/enchilada style burrito, with rice and beans. My husband had a enchilada and a blue corn tamale with rice and beans ala carte. We were warned the food is spicy. I'm not as spicy as my husband but I held my own and loved my food. The green and red salsas were good too. Try their house margaritas too! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Excellent \"New Mexican\" food.  Nice amount of heat, not to spicy.  We tried a variety of dishes all equally good.  Service was friendly and spot on."}
{"text":"Awful. Not sure the hype on this joint? Had the enchilada's with chicken in red sauce. Spicy! No flavor. The tortilla's were super thick, and there was nothing in the enchilada's?? WTF? The chicken had no flavor, so under seasoned. The beans were not refried but more like just frijoles. They had not real flavor. The rice was hard! Now, I understand this is not really mexican but more Santa Fe style or NM style. But it was terrible. I know the Central Ave location is the original and suppose to be better but honestly how much better could it be from this location? Really, it's that much better? Doubt it. Just another one of those Hyped up Phx places that really is a pile of crap!  I much rather go to a pile of crap called Carolinas which is 10 times better. What a joke this place was. No good at all but then again I am spoiled living in mexico for 8 years"}
{"text":"NO COMPARISON between this one and the Ahwatukee location (which I will rate a 4 or 5 soon). I ordered the chile relleno with adobada pork. It was terrible.  The beans were watery and bland.  They used a thick rubbery anaheim chile instead of pasilla which is a huge mistake, and the egg was separate from the chile.  The egg was wrapped around the chile.  The rice was mediocre.  Service was weak.  I would never go back.  I CANNOT BELIEVE this place is getting an average 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I now refuse to return, in spite of having had great food here in the past.  I showed up with a lady I am dating at 8:40pm on a Saturday night for a late dinner.  It seemed like a ghost town in there and I had to wait a few minutes just to have someone tell me, \"Sorry our kitchen is closed.\"  The posted closing time online is 2 a.m.  Do I expect the kitchen open that late?  No, but I think dinner before 9pm on a Saturday night is a reasonable expectation. So, based on that experience I'm demoting my four star review to a three, and refusing to return."}
{"text":"I moved to Arizona a  couple years ago and couldnt find any good Mexican food until I went to Los Dos, I have been there 4 times now and food has been delicious every time. It is always very busy and the wait staff is always friendly, the time before last night that i was there I noticed that the owner was the only one to take the orders at the tables, the only exception is when he was swamped with orders would someone else step in and take an order, with his \"0k\". I asked the server that had been helping us, other than taking our order she did everything else, I asked her why that was and she avoided the question with uncomfortable vibes so i tipped my usual 20% and didnt give it another thought. So last night was my very last visit i will make to that establishment. This is how it went........ So we get there at 5:30 and the place is already packed and \"the Owner\" is running around from one table to the next taking orders, since most patrons had all sat down at the same time due to the restaurant had just opened and filled up, we had eaten our meal and paid our bill and was talking to the girl which name i wont mention, due to she was probably let go last night....well I always tip in cash so i just pushed the cash towards her as we were getting up to leave and she said she wasnt allowed to take it and to just leave it on the table, I said WHAT? And i asked her if they pooled the tips she said no. She said that the \"OWNER\" AKA the order taker keeps all the tips and gives them a check for $100.00 at the end of the pay period, and pays the federal minimum serving wage of 7.25 hrly. I called him on it and his defensive reaction told me all I needed to know. I will be reporting him to the Federal Labor Bureau first thing tomorrow morning. Since last night I met a previous employee of \"Los Dos\" that has confirmed these facts and has agreed to help in any way they can. How dare you treat your employees in this way, I dont know how you can sleep at night. You can best believe I will be bad mouthing your ethics to any and all that will listen. If you feel you have to eat there please shove the cash in your servers pockets so they can feed their famiies or pay their bills."}
{"text":"It's the only Mexican food I'd drive across town for, and randomly get cravings for.  And the salsa...awesome, but also ask for their \"special hot\" if you're up for it.  The two top picks are the garlic pork and the adovado ribs, although I have yet to have anything short of amazing here.  Add in a full bar, a decent margarita, good service, and lots of space."}
{"text":"I fully expected to love this place as we're fans of the other locations and were so excited to see the sign on Camelback.  I give this location a big FAIL for service.  We were seated up front near the bar area by the guy I assumed was the owner/manager/full time bull-ish-er who spent the entire time visiting with a couple at the bar. My boyfriend asked for a soda and waters as we were being seated. The busser brought water,chips and salsa immediately and that was the last bit of 'good' service we received.  It took the waiter forever to come to our table just to take the order or even acknowledge we were there, again asked for soda. It took quite a bit of time for the soda to finally make an appearance at which point the food was delivered.  During our meal we tried flagging down the waiter 3 times to ask for drink refills. At one point he looked directly at us, nodded, and proceeded to forget about us.  After several attempts to flag him down I physically started waving my hands in the air as if I was stranded on an island waiting for a rescue but still not one single waiter/busser or captain BS at the bar seemed to notice or care. (and yes Mr. Bartender sir I DID in fact see that you saw and did nothing to alert the staff)  I understand talking to customers is part of the business but it shouldn't be at the expense of others.  I'll even give you that it was their opening week however there's no excuse for blatantly ignoring clients sitting 2 feet from you while you do nothing but chat it up with the cute lady at the bar.  Not once did the waiter come to ask how we were or to check on us. The place wasn't that busy but even if it were the guy at the bar could've, you know, just peeked his head up to see how everyone was doing. The food is good but not good enough to make me come back. And what's up with the horrendous decor. We had to eat in the corner with a marble bust of Geronimo giving us the evil eye!"}
{"text":"Cinco de Mayo - lunch on a  Monday.  Since they're closed Mondays - figured a great time to take advantage.  Well - it was good... but there are a LOT of good Mexican restaurants around here.  Nothing spectacular.  Both ordered dishes that included the Adovada ... it was hot - and I like hot.  But so much so that you really couldn't taste anything other than heat.  Oh well.  Next."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time today, and I have to say this is some of the best Mexican food I have ever had! You can just tell that everything is homemade and the green salsa is absolutely phenomenal! I can't stress it enough! If your looking for unbelievably delicious Mexican food definitely give this place a shot! We will definitely be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Really Really Crap Decor. Lousy Parking Lot. I liked the first Weinershnitzel location on the corner better. Hard to find for friends who are first timers! Same applies for the South Central Location... except the decor is fun there.  But who cares! Just say Carne Adovado Ribs...or burrito...or whatever, and stick an egg on top. I have driven hundreds of miles to come back for those, and if I was in NYC, their now-closed outpost was salvation. And, when I first visited Santa Fe, and started touring their restaurants, I was able to say...\"hot...You think this is hot? You need to try Los Dos Molinos!!!\"  I remember watching my father sweat for hours when he first tried the hot sauces, and they haven't changed one bit.   Margaritas are cloyingly sweet, but who cares...with the hot sauce and spices in the dishes, the sweetness actually works, and its about the only place where that doesn't upset me.  This might be consistently the worst balanced pitcher of margaritas i ever order, and when I am here, I enjoy every drop!!!!!!!!!!  The service can really suck on a weekend night on Central, but they're nice about it, and they've been putting up with me for 25 years now since they opened in Mesa.  And, after 25 years, I love seeing Vicky in the kitchen with a picture of the French Country house on the wall outside to show its been worthwhile for her too- well done. Because you've brought culinary joy to my life since you came down from Springerville."}
{"text":"I love coming here with co-workers for a nice hearty and spicy Mexican lunch. Basically everything on the menu is spicy so don't be too surprised if your mouth is on fire! I haven't been disappointed with any food options, but the service could use some work (hence the 3 and not 4). The same young lady seems to always be working and she is simply awful. Never smiles, cops an attitude when you ask to split checks, and NEVER checks on the table after food is delivered. Not sure if she has been there so long she doesn't care or maybe she is related to the owners? Plus side- if you check in on Yelp you'll get a free cheese crisp! Note: they are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Probably the BEST moistest, flavorful, awesome chicken burrito I have EVER eaten even after living in San Diego for 3 years.  I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but there were several staff there that as far as I could tell were just there to exist, but the there were 2 male servers that were doing there best to keep everything running.  The salsa is spicy, but also very flavorful.  I will visit this place again."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I read about others' bad service but was hoping for a good night. I thought I was invisible. Our order was to go, and half of it was missing, the other half was wrong. The order was ready and waiting and I was in there for a total of 25 minutes, waiting for an ipad?.  The food was not terrible but not worth the wait, inconvenience and missing food. I will never be back and I hope others will reconsider."}
{"text":"We've been to this location before and the food has gone downhill big time! Our server, Mathew, was great. He was very attentive and helpful. He said he was new, so I bet he won't stay long after dealing with management here. Hubby and I both ordered dinner, no apps, and each had a marg and a beer. Our bill was $80! $8 for a Dos Equis!  Oh, and one small side of sour cream... $2.50! The main kicker was we ordered 2 of their house \"hand squeezed\" margs. Menu said $9.25. Got the bill and they were each $11.25. No biggie, thought maybe they rang in the wrong marg or something. Nope. Guy at the front was nice enough and said the prices had changed, but the menu still said the wrong price. What?? So, you are charging people different prices than what is on your menu? He says I need to speak with his step dad who just happened to be walking over. I had watched this guy, older gentleman with a pony tail, walk around like he hated the place earlier in the night. He asks me what the problem is and I explain it to him. He then says I must have had a wrong menu and asks what the difference was.. he pulls a $5 out of the register, tells me \"there.. easy money\". And walks away. Huh?? I walked away feeling really weird about the whole thing. Food wasn't good, our server was nice, the owners step son was nice.. the owner/manager pony tail guy not so much. He needs to stay home. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Third time is a charm!  The first two times we were at Los Dos in ahwatukee, it was aweful!  The third time, was wonderful.  I guess they had to work out all the kinks.  The service was great, the food was excellent and everything was enjoyable.  I will continue to go to this location to support the ahwatukee community.  Good Job Los Dos!  Keep it up!!!!"}
{"text":"I always forget how good the food is here until I start to eat it. I also forget how hot it is until I taste the salsa. Yum!!! If you like it hot this is the place to come in Mesa. I can't speak for the other locations, I always come to this one on Alma School, but damn this place is good. I love the beef green chili plate but the red chili is awesome as well. I like the obviously house made flour tortillas also, they are thick which is not usually my thing, but I make an exception for these. Nothing fancy here but the place is always clean and the food is spicy and great. The service is also fast unless they are completely slammed. Had the green chili plate today. It did not disappoint. Always make sure you've got a pitcher of water or cold beer at your table. You might need more of it than you think."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food, SPICY, and delicious. Everyone else, just get over their paper menus, not a big deal, so cry about it somewhere else. It says on it that it's a temp menu anyway. Service has always been good, it's a kind of hole in the wall place so I'm not expecting perfection anyways, just good authentic food, and that's what you get. You don't like it, go across the street and get your \"Mexican food\" from a certain other place! Ring a BELL?"}
{"text":"My favorite place for amazing Mexican food!  I came here with a bunch of friends for the first time a while back. Never would I have expected such amazing food from this hidden treasure.  The restaurant: First of all, you wait outside in this crazy-awesome decorated patio, where the bar is opened to you and friends to have drinks while your table is being prepared. It gets pretty busy (and I can see why) so you can expect to enjoy the unique patio for a while. Which, is perfect when you're with a bunch of friends!  The bar: we had one drink: the HUGE pitcher of margaritas. It's about $25 and you get and entire pitcher of margaritas. They are probably some of the best ones I've had here in Phoenix.  The food: is truly amazing. I had the enchilada with a fried egg on top. The size was more than enough and everything about it was perfect!  The service: I really couldn't tell you how quick the service was. I was having such a great time with friends (and the margaritas) that time wasn't even on my mind.   For a great time, awesome food and great margaritas, come here! :)"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the Los Dos on Central Ave, but this location was a disappointment.  It seemed rather disorganized.  We went on an off night, so there wasn't a wait, but the service has a little off and the food seemed saltier than the Central location (which is plenty salty as it is).  Too bad, as I was really excited that these guys came into the neighborhood.  Maybe it will improve as time goes on.  I hope so."}
{"text":"Excellent New Mexican cuisine if you like a little extra kick. The food is spicy, but has a great flavor profile that leaves you feeling satisfied. The queso dip is a great starter, and I highly recommend their pork marinated in red chile."}
{"text":"I think most people remember this place because they do offer massive amounts of spicyness,  but remembering isn't the same as liking.     It's a place,  they'll serve you food.    There are a couple items you don't see much on menus,  and the ancient building it's in has some charm.     Not particularly endearing though.  Just meh."}
{"text":"I lived in Albuquerque and traveled all over New Mexico daily for 4 years. After moving to Arizona I realized how much I missed New Mexican food. This restaurant is the best New Mexican food in all of Arizona  The food is hot and spicy. It is a family owned and operated business. John is the best.  The makes the best margaritas ever also."}
{"text":"Great food. The Chili Rey Ado Burro is by far the hottest dish, packed with amazing flavor. Top it off with a Hand Squeezed Margarita and your set."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Los Dos since 2004 all sites south mountain, Mesa, camelback and chandler - best Mexican food resides here!  Great service great food!  The camelback location rocks!!! Never disappointed"}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was 10 yrs old with my Dad. I love hot food! If you are a weakling when it comes to hot food then this may not be the place for you. I can't get enough hot food and will continue coming here forever! The owners are great people and we love to support them!"}
{"text":"Got back to the Valley of the Sun after being away all summer to find that Los Dos Molinos is now open 7 days a week, including Sunday brunch starting at 11:00. We had the Huevos Rancheros and they were great. Headed back with friends next Sunday to sample more of the menu. Oh--and BTW--the Bloody Mary's are great too!"}
{"text":"Excellent all around.  I had the Chili Rellenos.  it was excellent, with just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  The salsas are amazing.  I particularly liked the salsa verde.  It was very hot, but also flavorful.  Might be the best salsa I've had."}
{"text":"Los Dos rocks.  Even if you have to wait for two hours, it is still worth it.  Prepare to wait.  Hang out on the patio and drink some beers and soak up the great company you hopefully came with.  If you are getting attitude from the people that work there, it is probably because you are being rude, acting idiotic, or are just plain clueless.    The food at Los Dos is like nothing else.  I generally prefer the specials (posted on the plastic surfboard), because I think they are super fresh, unique, and almost always amazing.  My favorite dishes from the menu are the garlic shrimp, the adovada ribs, and the Victoria's chili chicken plate-green.  However, the all-time greatest dish at Los Dos is the Angela's Special.  Yes, you read that correctly.  The Angela's Special is a chicken breast that is slowly cooked in a chili, topped with jalapeno-tomatillo sauce and cheese, and served over plain rice, with beans and tortillas on the side.  It is the most delicious thing ever...spicy yet flavorful, moist and flaky at the same time, and just wonderful.  If you are lucky enough to experience the Angela's Special, your life will improve...it is that good.  Do I even have to talk about how fantastic the salsas are, or how great the Herradura margarita can be?  No, try it for yourself.  I will say, however, that the snacks and margaritas are not as fresh on the patio as they are inside (which is why I suggest beer on the patio), so if you can wait until you get inside, you will be rewarded.  Now, I have heard that there have been some changes going on with who is running each Los Dos, and all I can say is that if Cheryl is around, everything will be that much better..."}
{"text":"Some like it mild.  If so, they should come to this location of Los Dos.    I tried this Los Dos recently for the first time, and all I can say is that is was mellow.  No wait on a Friday night and we had over 20 people.  Crazy.  Another thing that was mellow was the heat.  I had been talking up how hot Los Dos is to the newcomers and warning them about how spicy certain dishes are (the Adovada ribs in particular), and nothing was hot.  Well, the salsa was pretty warm (and actually quite tasty), but all of our dishes were not spicy at all...adovada ribs, Victoria's chili chicken, nothing.  It was kind of a bummer.    Maybe since this location is new, it is still working out the kinks, but they need to work on the heat level if they are going to call it a Los Dos.    That said, I enjoyed the new location (right on the light rail), and I look forward to hopping on the light rail and heading down there in the future, but they need to spice things up a bit first.  For now, I am going to head back to Central...where it is never mellow."}
{"text":"I'm kind of a snob when it comes to Mexican food. I was raised on the homemade stuff all my life so generally I don't bother to go to a mexican restaurant. Why would I when I can get much better stuff at home?  Anyways, I was so pleased with Los Dos Molinos mexican food that it's now the place I suggest when our family is celebrating something.  Their stuff is HOT HOT HOT, but if you don't like hot you can let them know and they'll help you find something that isn't spicy. The prices are a little up there but in my opinion its worth it. I imagine that their kitchen is full of Mexican grandmothers...that's how authentic it feels. (Don't tell me otherwise because I really like this fantasy)  Their margaritas are really good too. You can tell it doesn't just come from a mix.   and OH MY GOD THE SOPAPILLAS!!!!    My dad works for a company that inspects the top of gas ranges and he serviced this restaurant and said that it was the cleanest restaurant kitchen he'd ever seen. (Believe me he has some horror stories)  My only problem is that it didn't feel like they had the air on at all. They have ceiling fans but come on...it's 115 outside."}
{"text":"I just had to give this local spot a second chance.  The 2nd time around I knew what to avoid and asked the waiter/bartender for suggestions.  He didn't lead me astray!  I had the Carnitas Platter that was packed with a plentiful serving of moist flavorful pork (actually about 3 servings). Their tortilla was scrumptious on its own and the rice & beans  were simply irresistible.    My hubby's chicken burrito with red sauce was a little too hot for even this fire breathing dragon. Again, you need to know what to avoid on this menu.  I'm not a fan of the decor here, I think they need a make over from the original Va Bene design so, I strongly suggest a Carnitas Platter with extra tortillas to go!"}
{"text":"Really not New Mexican in my opinion.  Closer to a sub par sonoran.  Really need to have someone try a true carne adovada before they put that on the menu."}
{"text":"Party of three for a casual business lunch and the food was fantastic.  The ribs, the red chili and the tacos were a hit.  The flavored were very original and prepared perfectly.  Probably wouldn't come here for anything formal, but our service was good and the servers were attentive.  Coming back again - soon!"}
{"text":"Why haven't I eaten here before?? We were checking in on the construction of new station 203 right next door and decided to grab some lunch. Now, I like some spicy food --- really spicy and this hit the spot! Omg the red salsa is freaking killer!!! I had the lunch special, shrimp enchiladas with green sauce and they were excellent. The service was great and I will absolutely return! Definitely an authentic Mexican joint I'll have to introduce to my hubby."}
{"text":"Excellent food and nice staff. I always go for the carnitas plate. This place adds a spicy kick. So delicious. One of my favorite spots in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Totally delicious.  I am a fan of hot, and THIS is hot.  Restaurant is named after the two chili grinders that they whoop your but with.  Adovada (think that's how ya spell it) is freaking amazing!  Its red chili pork, stuff it in your face!"}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos is my all time favorite Mexican restaurant! The food is amazing! I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone , the Chavez Family has stayed true to the the original recipes of Victoria and Eddie. Marisa , John and the entire staff are attentive and give great customer service . I have been a faithful customer for 20 + years and will continue to be!"}
{"text":"Worst service! Our server literally forgot about us. She's lucky we didn't just leave without paying... I'm a server and I'm sorry just so unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. Love how spicy the salsa is, but the taco salad was a little bland."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food in Phoenix. Blue corn chicken enchilada green sauce"}
{"text":"Burning Salsa and the Crisp That Wasn't.  After shopping at Trader Joe's we decided to try Los Dos Molinos (LDM) for lunch as it has a cool vibe with its outside dining, music and festive decor. The folks at Trader Joe's had told us that LDM serves very spicy food (which we love) - and they were not kidding! The red and green salsas served with the too thick chips were tasty, but the red salsa was needlessly, painfully hot. An adjacent table complained about the salsa's heat, and the waiter told them he could not eat it either and offered a milder version - the wait staff should offer all guests this from the beginning.  We split a cheese crisp with Machaca beef ($11) that was very, very tasty, however, except for the crust, it was not crispy at all - in fact it was downright soggy - a real shame given the beef's depth of flavor! 16 ounce Negro Modellos draft beers were only $4 - and the prices were actually listed on the menu, which we really appreciate!  Our waiter was very personable and did a great job as did the chips and salsa guy. The only issue we had is that our credit card via an I-pad while the waiter waits - who then has to go inside to get the receipt. So what's the point?  We really wanted to like LDM, but will stick with Abuelo's from now on."}
{"text":"First time here and enjoyed it very much.  I asked for a recommendation and the Adovado (red chili marinade) was the quick response.  Tasty and spicy, hit the spot and the home made salsas were a big hit with me too.  At first glance the prices seem just a tad high but the quality and time it takes to produce high quality shines through"}
{"text":"Los Dos is a Valley of the Sun classic. We've been eating here for years and it's always consistent and delicious. We love the great recipes with the wonderful spice that you just don't get from the chain places."}
{"text":"The salsa is spicy and the margaritas are strong.  The food is spicy but I could handle hotter.  The portions are reasonable and the prices are moderate.  The owner can regularly be seen there and has stopped to see how I'm doing more often then not.  I prefer the mesa location over the Phoenix one simply because it's easier to get to and usually less crowded."}
{"text":"In the history of histories, this place has to be Ahwatukee's best kept secret. Best food in town!!!  I've been living here for over a year and we finally made our way over to Los Dos Molinos. I am from New Mexico and the salsa reminded me of my grandma. It actually made me cry. Not tears of pain but tears of joy!  Finally. Someone knows how to do it right. I got a tostada which was to die for and my main squeeze got an enchilada stack with a fried egg with beans and rice AND A chile relleno. Perfection."}
{"text":"I am happy to say that the newest store in the family is as great as all the rest. We went on Friday evening and the place was packed.The service was excellent as was the food. We were seated promptly and were treated like family. Reminded me of the old days going to the \"A\" frame in Mesa. I highly recommend  and will return soon. Bonus of running into old friends."}
{"text":"I always stop in here when I'm in the area and my foodie friends love this place too.  Like a lot of places, the food is really good if you order the right thing.   You need to understand that the food is New Mexico style, so while similar to Mexican food is has certain nuances (spice levels and certain ingredients) that set it apart.  The food at Los Dos Molinos is spicy, but the menu guides you a bit.  If your not sure, I highly suggest having the waiters/waitresses help you figure out what you might enjoy without getting scorched.   Trust me, this place has some scorching dishes, easily washed down with a good beer or margarita.  My favorites are the Sopapillas, Blue corn enchilada (add Chicken) and the Garlic Roast Pork.  The service here is good and the staff is friendly, but like any place that gets busy you may need to deal with a few delays, so sit back, relax and have a Cerveza or Margarita."}
{"text":"Can I give \"zero\" stars to appropriately measure the customer service experience here?  We ordered drinks and they were bad. Bitter. Terrible.  It happens. When I took them to the bar the bartender took it personal and became condescending, combative and highly unprofessional.  She even discussed whatever her issue was with me to other patrons.  Then, she told me \"go sit down\".  Excuse me?!  While back at my table she came over and said \"what's the problem\" along with \"don't you give me an attitude\" and lastly \"the manager tasted the drink and agreed it's bitter\".  I have NEVER been treated this way at a restaurant and it will never happen again; I will be sure to share my awful experience at this location with everyone.  #GrandOpeningGrandCLOSING"}
{"text":"Always wonderful Los dos never disappoints. We live it at all of the locations.  We have been to each and love them all.  Great service and great food.    We tried almost everything on their menus and at each of the locations.  Each is individual in their recipes and in their preparation.  Expect each to be unique in its own wonderful way.     Great family places that we love."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants.   We've been going to these restaurants for 20 years. I even asked my wife to marry me there. They always treat us like family. It is one of those places that we crave.  Great food great service friendly people wonderful salsa we love it love it love it!"}
{"text":"I was getting tired of all the chain restaurants that we were eating at and I asked around for a recommendation of Mexican food.  This place was the highlight of my week in Phoenix.  Great family owned business that delivers on authentic Mexican taste.   The shredded beef taco, the creamy chicken plate, and the flan was all off the hook.  The spot is off of Scottsdale blvd, but it is worth the drive where ever you are coming from.  Only if they served carnitas...."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 17 years. John runs a great resturant.  They have the best margaritas in town hands down. Try A on the specials menu. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this Mexican food restaurant before we were invited to attend a birthday celebration that took place tonight. I looked over the menu online, checked out reviews, and made what I hoped would be great choices while we were there.  It was a bit cramped at our table of 8 while ordering, no room to really look over the menues but, not too big of a deal since I had mostly chosen beforehand. Our waiter came and was so quick to take our order that he cut me off not even half way through my order of a main dish and add on choices, and then proceeded to skip my husband/date.   The salsa was excellent, nice and hot, as well as flavorful. The chips were good.  Once my meal came I was very underwhelmed. I ordered a green corn tamale, a green beef enchilada with an egg, and beans with a side of sour cream.    The green corn tamale was nothing but very thick and over cooked masa. It's crowning achievement was it's spiciness. It felt like I was supposed to enjoy the fact that it was spicy and ignore the fact that it was bland, overcooked, and unremarkable. I left it on the plate half way through, I was hoping the middle would taste like something more but, it did not.  The green beef enchilada was missing the beef completely I think? Unless the beef was pulverized into the green chili sauce? And even that was barely flavorful. Really again, it was just nice and spicy, hoping to carry itself with the spice but, lacked for flavor...   The beans were beans...  I certainly have no interest in going back. I can make spicy at home, I love spicy. But spicy without flavor is not good cooking. And rushed service makes you feel unimportant. Not a good experience. They assumed an 18% tip was acceptable and added it to our bill. As an ex waitress, this is never ok with me. It is rude. If I feel you deserve more and you assume, then you do not get more, you will likely get less despite it being policy at times."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  After hearing so many talk about this place and how spicy the food is, we finally gave it a try. The food was wonderful, and we will definitely be back! The food was not spicy at all! But then again, we like habernaros!"}
{"text":"I love it hot and at Los Dos it is almost hot enough for me, and for the average person the food is hot as shit. In comparison to other places the margs are strong, some say the price is high but the comparison is not from my neighbordhood, and at least they have booze in them. I dig the wait while I sit on the patio with a marg or two, you have to learn how to make good us of your time. Good food and drink with a very diverse crowd that I always find entertaining."}
{"text":"Stellar customer service, but an ok rating on my main dish (I ordered the chicken burro enchilada style) because it was a little bit dry. I know that LDM is known for the spicy factor, but both the green and red complimentary house salsas were OUTTA CONTROL HOT! It was the kind of hot that you cannot stop eating, BUT ***WARNING*** it's the kind of HOT that slowly creeps up and kicks you from behind so hard that your neck snaps your head back!"}
{"text":"The best mexican food ever-if you like it spicy which of course I do! Service and food are excellent. Love los dos molinos!"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Los Dos for over twenty years, best New Mexican food in AZ. They only use the best chile, the favor can't be beat. I must for anyone that enjoys spicy. The staff is always welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Despite a lot of negative reviews about service we gave this Los Dos a try. We normally go to the one on Alma School. Everything, including the service, was very good.  There was a table of 16-18 that had not gotten their food yet so I was a little concerned it would be a long night. We got our food in a timely fashion, drinks and water were refreshed often. Management is obviously listening to the reviews and are working on their service. We will definite return as the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Yes, the salsa is hot.  So much so, that your seared taste buds might not be able to enjoy the culinary splendor that is the rest of your meal.  Great traditional New Mexican fare.  Spend your time with one of their pork dishes or rellenos.  Great friendly service.  And they've got a great \"this is what you'd get if you drove through a small town in New Mexico on a Friday night and were looking for a place to eat and mingle with the locals\" kind of ambiance."}
{"text":"My gf and I recently went there for a friends birthday.  We showed up a little late after most had already sat down.Drinks took close to 15min for a coke and margarita.  While waiting for drinks we tried some of the hottest salsa we've ever had. The salsa was so spicy was so spicy most of the table left it alone after a few bits.  When we were about to finaly able to order it took close to 40 minutes for our dishes to come out.  I had a chicken chimi and she had a chili relleno.  Both were  very plain and pretty boring.  Overall the food is a average and the service is terrible.  Los Dos Molinos in Ahwatukee is living on the name of the other locations."}
{"text":"The best in it's class. The food is quite warm and the salsas are both hot. I prefer the red but I like the green one too. Even the bean burrito is hot, everything in the place is excellently warm. Except the Margaritas and water. Get the pitcher."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this all year.   We're actually able to sit on the patio enjoying a lovely Sunday brunch.    After yesterday's storm burst from the weather cell out of the Gulf of Mexico, the temperature is absolutely gorgeous here in the valley!  This is what it is to live in Phoenix!  Spent the morning pulling weeds and transplanting mesquite trees to work up a hearty appetite for some yummy Mexican food.  Ordered my usual bean and cheese Burrito and consider doing enchilada style but meh went sans extra sauce to enjoy the amazing salsa!  I had the bean and cheese burrito Scott had the guacamole tostada and both were simply scrumptious.  Halfway through I kept telling Scott, \"I'm full, I'm full.\" No matter how full I got, I just kept eating!  Looking for a relaxing, Sunday brunch with chips & beer?  Los Dos Molinos is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Heavy square glass for the margaritas was all wrong.  The sopa was like dishwater with a couple chunks of pork. Totally unimpressed."}
{"text":"For the absolute best in New Mexican cuisine, this is the place to go!! Fairly priced, nice atmosphere. Don't ask for mild because they don't know how to make that."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with this place great food. Service....well n the bar could be way better. But all a round a great place. Letter A & H r the best."}
{"text":"This is an absolute homerun. My favorite Mexican food in Mesa. It is hot... so be careful. Service is great!!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Free cheese crisp from checking in. Great service. Good spice. Kind of pricey. Sampled all of the tamales and they were all great!! I'd definitely come back. Great service and great food for a not so fancy place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at Los Dos! Was recommended this place for their amazing mexican, spicy salsa and entrees, and strong/delicious margaritas. All 3 were true! Too often mexican restaurants don't put enough heat in their salsas and entrees, but this place it seems to be the norm! Will be making this a regular spot to enjoy. The adovado ribs are worth a try!!"}
{"text":"This place has served the best Mexican food of my life.  At 70 miles or so round trip, it was a serious pilgrimage to make it down there, but if one could arrange an outing, the pitchers of margaritas and fiery entries made it very much worth doing.  It is inexpensive as well, so you may be surprised at the smallness of the bill when it arrives for the amount of fun you have.  It is very far away from most of Phoenix and don't stray too far from the beaten path out here or you might end up in sketchy neighborhood land."}
{"text":"The Adobado ribs make me shit fire for three days, but I keep going back. Granted, the staff is a little pretentious, the margaritas are grossly overpriced, the wait sucks, the place is noisy, and there's only one spice level (hot as holy shit), but it's a true cultural experience, which is more than I can say for the rest of Phoenix, homogeneous craphole that it has become...   Also, this is NOT Tex-Mex, so quit saying that. Tex-Mex is from Texas, and it usually refers to beef enchiladas covered in chili and Velveeta, not insanely spicy New Mexico cuisine, which is how you would describe Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"Authentic good food.  Casual place and visually nothing special.  The server was funny and cool, the food was great.  Our group ordered a variety of things from tacos to burritos and a whole bunch of things to go into here.  Everything was very good and tasty.  The only thing we thought was that the margs could have been better, nore simple and authentic.  They are a bit americanized with maybe sweet and sour, which sucks.  The food and beer are great though."}
{"text":"So disappointing. We thought the food here was supposed to be spicy? No flavor at all. 3 meals ordered and not one had flavor or spice. Waiter was rude and deserted us after we received our disappointing food. Will not return."}
{"text":"Not sure I understand the bad reviews here.  Went here for lunch one day and the food was incredible.  Portions were huge and everything was super SPICY!  Which is why we went here in the first place.  I guess if you do not like spicy then definitely avoid Los Dos.  Servers were very quick and attentive as well.  Still, in shock of the bad reviews!"}
{"text":"If you like your food spicy like me, this is definitely a great place.  I loved my carne avado relleno!  We got a picher of house Margaritas for $21 bucks, they tasted great and we got a great buzz.  I hate paying for Margaritas with no alochol in them, not the case here!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now and the foods is good, but VERY spicy.  This time I decided it's too spicy to really enjoy.  Also, the service wasn't that great this time. We had a party of 6 and sat in the front bar area by the window. I had to ask for drinks, water and to place our order. finally another server came so the service improved 1/2 way through.  One of the couples had never been, she ordered the shrimp dish with rice and cheese. It's a $15 dollar dish and only got 4 shrimp.  And she didn't care much for it.  But the highlight was a cockroach running around under our table.  I had to go get staff to take care of that. I realize most restaurants have them, ya just don't see them. But that kinda ruined it for me along with the spiciness. One more thing, the music was high energy like dance club and loud. And it was early, about 530 on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Be Prepared for Excellent Spicy Flavor!!! I really like spicy and the food is very flavorful. I'm kinda bummed to see so many negative reviews due to the spice content because they are proud of their spicy content. I personally have been many times and each has been an excellent experience to my palate; I try something new each time I go too. But don't go with a Gringo tongue if you don't like spicy then complain after getting burnt, kinda like being mad if a bear bites you after poking it."}
{"text":"Awesome food, slow service.  **This review is for the chimichangas .***  Keep in mind that this food is New Mexican...so it is differenent than typical Mexican food (typical as in Mexican food from California...the food here in AZ always seems to be more Tex Mex to me).  And since everyone experiences \"Mexican\" food differently...to me Mexican food from California, the way my family makes it is more simple with less ingredients.  AZ/Tex Mex food seems to be a lot more fussy and I usually do not like it.  New Mexican food also uses more ingredients and spices, but New Mexican food uses spices differently than Tex-Mex.  In any case...the salsa is hot...not too hot and still has flavor.  (I am not sensitive to heat so this salsa is probably burning hot to some people.)  My husband & I both got chimichangas...he got beef with red sauce & I got beef with green sauce...they both were delicious.  I would ask to have both sauces...one on each side next time.  The beans that came with the plate were very good.  The rice was delicious...I am so over my mom's boring spanish rice...this rice was different.  I noticed that the chimichanga has the slightest bit of cinammon on it...I think it probably helps bring out the flavor of the salsa.  OMG, these were the best chimichangas I've ever had in my entire life...besides this other place in Orange, CA.  I will definitely bring my family here when they visit me and I will try more stuff next time."}
{"text":"Do not go here!!! I got food poisoning from the carnitas plate and the menudo, not sure which one because I had some of both. The food looked good but was cold.. and I will never go back because the thought of it makes my stomach hurt."}
{"text":"This place has good food.  What I like about it is that it's spicy.  My favorite place to go is the hole in wall mexican place.  this is a notch above that. They have a bar.  They also have dietcoke.  Can't say there is anything I would particularly recommend.  I think I had a green or blue corn tamale that was outstanding.  I love the salsa it's unique. Not just red salsa.  My complaint is that I feel like they dont care about the food.  It's not really consistent.  There is little care to quality. The people that work there always seem like they are suffering being at work.  Not to say that the service is bad.  I have had much worse food.  I have been there a dozen times.  I have also had much better food in Arizona.  So 3 stars reflects that fact that it's average. if you love mexican food like me. Then you should try los dos molinos."}
{"text":"if i could give more stars, i would! Mex is a family favorite for us... this place was recommended to us while we were here for our fist vaca in AZ. i thought we were lost because we drove through a neighborhood to get there, but sure glad we made it! This is definitely the spot if you like your food SPICY/HOT! and if you don't like too much fire, there is plenty of other items to choose also, i did. we only like to try off the \"chain\" type places, and like to get as many different ones in.. this one had us reeled in 2 or 3 times in our one stay... we couldn't stay away! the prickly pear margaritas is a a flavor we haven't come across anywhere else since... they were the best I've had... and for dessert... SOPPAPIA's all the way! if your gonna ruin ur diet w/ dessert, u have to do it right, and get them loaded with everything! they are like warm, soft pillows of heaven in your mouth! ITS A MUST! most places they are usually fried flat and to a crisp, and just so-so... here, you'll eat them til u hurl!  I KNOW!"}
{"text":"Always a great place, we visit Los Dos 1-2x everytime we are in Phoenix yearly. This time we gave the Mesa location a go, opposed to the original. Food and service were great as usual, however the food didnt seem as spicy as at the original Los Dos and the ambiance is not the same...has more of the standard restuarant look and feel. Not a knock at all...still amazing food regardless!!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible! Not only did we wait forever  for our food (that did not taste very good by the way) they had horrible service! They did not ask us once about the food and took forever for our check! I would not recommend this place at all! Not worth the wait for the food. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, energetic employees that were super and fun to watch their interaction with each other, seem to have their own little world.   Service was fast and really on top of keeping my Alex's iced tea filled, that's hard to do with Alex, he drinks alot of tea. They get points for that. I checked into the gluten free options and they didn't have a menu but he did say that their red sauce was made with corn starch, somehow i wasn't completely  convinced so i went safe and went with a taco salad minus the flour tortilla shell, i really enjoyed that, next time i will add green onions, the only thing missing.  I can't remember what my Alex had but here's a picture, it looks really good, huh? I miss eating things like that. Salsa was really hot and i thought the red sauce had tons of flavor, i sided with the red over the green.  We will eat here again, food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately not a great place for service! We went with a group of friends and chose this place because of the Phoenix magazine review...disappointed to say the least. The food was pretty good. I had a chicken burrito and the guacamole was amazing! But the owner was extremely rude! They wouldn't seat or even take a soda order for my friends before we got there. When there was two tables open on the patio the the waiter asked us to choose one, when I sat down the \"owner\" walked by and asked if I would like to sit at a dirty table (well...not really) in an extremely rude demeaning tone. That was the FIRST of many unfortunate happening at this restaurant specifically with the lady owner.  Our waiter, a younger guy that said she was family was actually very nice and apologetic that she was not a happy person...obviously we could tell that by the way we were treated. Will not make the drive back..."}
{"text":"You know you're in for some spicy flavors when they bring a picture of ice water to the table and the drink special is a 32 oz beer.  We really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.  I highly recommend for folks who love mexican food, but want to try it with a different twist.  The dinner plates are terrific and the pork outstanding.  Everything spicy, so consider yourself forewarned."}
{"text":"Food was so salty it was not edible. Wait staff was rude. Overall dingy place. Will never be returning."}
{"text":"Adovada chimi and a bean and cheese burrito. Great flavor. They came out and personally explained the menu, chili (spicyness), my vegetarian options. Thank you for the personal service!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming for about three years, great food and a decent price! The workers are very tentative and so nice! Every time I have visitors, this is one of the top places that I take them."}
{"text":"I've just not had better Mexican food!! Period!!! I was introduced to their restaurant over 30 years ago in Springerville, AZ. The first time I'd heard of or had a Chimichanga. I didn't even like hot, spicy foods then but they converted me. I've loved their food ever since but was without it for more than 25 years while living in Colorado. Having recently moved to Phoenix I went looking for the restaurant as I knew they had a Phoenix location, at least way back then. Thank heavens they have several in the Phoenix alley! If you life hot spicy well prepared classic Mexican food, you have to try Los Dos Molinos. I've truly not had better in all my years.  I had a favorite mom & pop Mexican food restaurant in Colorado that still makes the best hot green chili sauce, but Los Dos's food is better. It's definitely sooo much better than the Macayo's  and other chain Mexican food places and so far, beats all other mom & pop, non-chain local mexcan food places like Federico's, Filiberto's, Julioberto's (and any other that sound much the same as those three places) Lupita's, Caramba's, Salsita, etc. Want it hot? Want it tasty? Then you want Los Dos Molino's! (I have no affiliation with Los Dos, nor am I asked/paid to review them.)"}
{"text":"Amazing comfort Mexican food!!  The sauce is spicy, but if you love flavor, this is definitely a must-try!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has such a low rating.  The food here is amazing, but like the menu says can be a little spicy.  I have to agree with Jesse J on the Adovada Ribs.  I have a rotation of about four things that I get here but the Ribs are my go to.    I probably make it over there about every other week and have always been treated great.  The owner is great and the service has always been good.  Good (strong) margaritas and beers, great food, and chips and salsa.  Just be ready for a little kick with the salsa. . ."}
{"text":"I used to eat at Los Dos Molinos regularly for almost ten years. But lately I've gotten fed up and I no longer go. There are far better Mexican restaurants in the Valley.   I think the success of this restaurant has led to arrogance on their part. I noticed a few incidents of rude behavior during my last few visits, which is what prompted me to stop going. One day I showed up with 4 friends (mixed crowd of well-dressed males and females, some lawyers and an engineer) on a very hot day around 5 pm. When I made the mistake of admitting that there were 5 in my party, the host told us he wouldn't seat us until the 5th arrived EVEN THOUGH there were empty tables. Then he told us to wait outside rather than in the restaurant. It was over 100 degrees outside so I asked him if we could be seated given that it was so hot, and he said it was their \"policy\" to wait until the full party arrived. I glared at him and said in a civil tone: \"That's not a very nice way to treat your guests.\" He just looked at me and shrugged his shoulders.   That's how they rewarded almost ten years of my loyalty as a customer.   A friend of mine who has kids was also turned off by a sign in the restaurant that says, \"Please control your kids\". I don't have kids and I agree that parents should control their kids, but it's the \"we don't really care if we seem rude to you\" attitude that I choose not to deal with anymore.  By the way I read another review suggesting you call ahead to make reservations due to wait times. It's the \"policy\" of Los Dos Molinos not to take reservations over the phone. You have to show up and wait. Wait times on Friday and Saturday can be 1-2 hours at the South Phoenix location. On weekend nights they open up a second part of their patio where you can have beer, and chips and salsa for a charge. But it's cash only and there are no ATMs.  I've never had any attitude problems at the Mesa restaurant, but the Mesa one has a lot less character than South Phoenix. I've also been to the one in Springerville (northern Arizona) and it was great."}
{"text":"It is a little bit of a drive. However, if you have never driven to the top of South Mountain when you are in Arizona, you're missing out! Not that the restaurant is located there. It is however near the entrance to the park and you can catch it on the way in or out.  South Mountain has breathtaking views of the valley and the photo opportunities at sunset are amazing. It gives you a whole new aspect on the Downtown Phoenix Skyline.  Now about the restaurant. This place is quaint and authentic and offers a taste into great Mexican cuisine! The margaritas are large and tasty! Don't miss the Sangria Margarita (Twyla loved it!) The patio is cozy and friends are made easily during dinner conversation here.  The food as a whole is awesome and it is our favorite of three locations to visit. I had the Green Chili Carne Burrito and a Machaca Taco. Both were wonderful. Our server was both funny and accommodating. If you have never ventured to the South side of town, don't be scared, they like to eat just like you and I. So, just because your on the South side of town, does not mean that something bad will happen. Different cultures. That's all. If you don't take a cruise down here you are really missing out. Live a little I say! Viva la Mexico!  #Vino2 #Vino2ultimate #Vinosquared #irishcatv2 #jimsboisset"}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos, you are like my exgirlfriend.  Ridiculously HOT. Soooo tasty that I can't resist going back for more. Kicking me in the balls at every opportunity. A major attitude problem from knowing that you're all that and that if I dump you you'll just replace me with another customer without another thought. You even treat my friends like crap. You made one wait for 20 minutes today because he was honest enough to say there were 2 in his party but I was late. Totally pissed him off with your \"we won't seat you until you're all here\" policy. So arrogant. No wonder I've sworn to all my friends that I will never come back to you again.   Did I mention that you're ridiculously hot? I love you."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place.  They are not your typical Mexican food place!  Their theme, \"Some like it hot!\" is exactly right.  If you can't handle chili heat, don't bother.  The family run off shoot of a Valley mainstay, the Chandler Blvd location offers crazy spicy Adovada ribs that are as good as they are hot.  You can also get the spicy pork in a burrito or enchiladas. Their beef tacos are over stuffed (not as spicy) and a meal unto themselves.  If you don't want the spice, try their carnitas, slow roasted pork.  Cheryl occasionally mixes up additional kinds salsas to supplement her normal spicy red or green salsas, so ask if they have anything mixed up. Their beans are flavorful and creamy.  Also, try their posole or menudo a if available."}
{"text":"Came here for cinco de mayo and even though the restaurant was packed and the food took a while, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was really delicious. If you are a fan of spicy Mexican food then this is the place for you. The staff was nice to us and joked around a bit, but I agree with some of the previous reviewers that mentioned the prices are a little high, but overall it was great and I'd come again."}
{"text":"If Taco Bell \"Fire\" sauce is just that, you best move along. ... If you like it, want it and NEED it hot - look no further. ... Los Dos Molinos Uptown is to love and pain what Reese's is to chocolate and peanut butter; It is quite simply my favorite restaurant on Earth and tastefully skates between \"too much\" and \"never enough.\"  I'm blessed to have eaten at every Los Dos Molinos location (Springerville, South Phoenix, Mesa, Manhattan, Uptown) and this is THE best of The Best. Take your antacid, drop the gloves and enjoy. The food is hot, true; but, it's also extremely complex, taking diners to their respective edge.  No worries, their margaritas are as good as their food (and that's saying a lot!), providing the delicious fire hydrant's worth of tequilaandallsortsofs***thatifailtomakeanysenseof. But, walk softly -- like the food -- these margaritas mean business. Between the food AND beverages, you're in for it.  Again, if you've purchased a \"Pace\" product in your life, please find your local Macayos. If you're into living life to the fullest, go no further. Finally, the restaurant has a great ambiance, working equally well for a first date, Happy Hour or birthday party. The staff is second to none, and yes, the bartender is Drop Dead Gorgeous. True."}
{"text":"If you're not a fan of spicy food, stay away from Phoenix's Los Dos Molinos. The New Mexican restaurant \"doesn't know how to make mild,\" meaning the salsas and sauces will burn your tongue off if you're weak like me. Thankfully, the sodas are served in extra-large glasses, and every table gets its own pitcher of water to wash the food down with.  The family-owned restaurant, which is decorated with a mix of Native American and Mexican kitschy art, originated in Arizona and now has four locations in the state, as well as one in New York.  My dining companion and I ordered combination plates--he got two beef tacos with beans and rice ($10.95), while I munched on cheese enchiladas ($11.95). Skip the chili sauce if you don't want a spicy meal--it was tough to finish mine, since I opted for the tasty and spicy green chili.  My pal pointed out that the food tasted super-fresh, probably because no meal is made until it's ordered. It came out in about 5 minutes, though, so the staff definitely knows what they're doing in the kitchen.  For dessert, we ordered the best sopapillas ($5.95) I've ever had. They were so soft and doughy, almost like a thicker version of fry bread. If only I had saved more room, and my burned taste buds, for dessert.  Next time, I'll skip the chili sauce and use the salsa sparingly on the thick-cut chips."}
{"text":"The salsa is so hot that you'll be hating life the next day with a burning chocolate starfish. Waiters are jerky and the food is way to salty.. I think they want you to buy more of their over priced drinks!  They lost the Mr.'s Amex on the last visit and got really bitchy with him because he was upset. Ended up calling Amex and reporting the card stolen and didn't pay for dinner. With that we will never return. However up to that point we had always had a good time there even though its mediocre at best."}
{"text":"As far as food goes 5 stars, however their random hours can be frustrating when I get a craving and they are closed. They don't keep any regular hours from what I can tell so I always call ahead to make sure they are open before heading that way. The food though..... Amazing!!! Spicy slasa and chillis. My brother is a fan of the kick ass margarita, they are just okay for me. My favorite place for authentic New Mexican food."}
{"text":"Love me some Los Dos!  This place is an all time favorite.  Their food is hot, full of flavor, and you can't pick a wrong item on the menu!  Service is great, always a friendly smile, and I love seeing the same faces!  Try the sangria margaritas too, you'll be giggling in no time!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican Food!!! And the spicier the better!!  This place is OK.  I recently moved here from the East Coast so I have been looking to find the best Mexican Food here (feel free to contact with recommendations).  I have been here twice (it is less than 2 blocks from my house) and enjoyed it both times.  The food was OK.  I think they try to survive on being very hot.  However, my experience was that the food was tolerably hot.  Many seem to think the salsa is too hot.  I liked the green salsa a lot.  The red salsa was spicy, but not overly spicy in my opinion, but it did not taste good.  The gentleman that served me was very nice.  All in all, I think the food is OK.  The service is OK.  The only problem I had was that I though that the pricing was a bit expensive for typical Mexican fare.  Many of the dishes are $12 or over, with some of them topping $20.  I will continue to go here when I do not want to cook because it is close, but will certainly be checking out other places as well."}
{"text":"We went here based on a random recommendation. The chips and salsa were very good. The food is quite hot."}
{"text":"A college friend of my husband who has lived in Phoenix for several decades took us here a few years ago when we went to the Fiesta Bowl.  We have subsequently come to Phoenix the last 3 years for spring training.  Although this is really my husband's trip, my non-negotiable demand for Phoenix trips is Los Dos Molinos.  The chile relleno is fabulous-all the food we've had there has been good.  The restaurant itself is kind of a charming rabbit-warren of connected smallish rooms and patios that are always full of multi-age, multi-generational, and multi-cultural tables of happy eaters and drinkers.  The bar is good sized but this is probably not a good place to go if you are in a hurry....just sayin"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. Even with a limited amount of time in the area and we went twice on our last visit.  The Best Mexican food I've ever had and delicious margaritas. Their happy hour is the best deal in town and need to try it next time.  Chorizo dip is yum, I wish it was spicier but I add the Hot sauce and it's amazing. Comes with flour tortilla chips that you wish you had a bag of.  Can't ever decide on red or green sauce so I get both on enchiladas or burritos. Whole pinto beans and rice always compliment the plate. Oh you must get a shredded beef taco, the most tender flavorful beef I've ever had. Flautas also perfect medium fried rolls I had one leftover for breakfast one day.  The decor is funky and AZ cowboy style, lots to look at and feels like home. The bar area is nice and dim but feels festive always.  Employees seem to like their job and work there forever which is wonderful to see the same friendly faces. Always accommodating.  I need to figure out how to FedEx some Los Dos Molinas to my door I miss it already"}
{"text":"I love this place. Authentic New Mexican style food with a fun vibe. My favorite dishes are the red and green \"christmas\" chicken enchiladas, green chili stew (perfect for when it's cold outside!) and bean + cheese burro with green on top! I've never had a bad experience, and the margs are seriously awesome! Plus the bar tender is pretty hot ;)"}
{"text":"Good food, beautiful atmosphere, and great service.   The salsa leaves your mouth all tingly."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to one of the Los Dos locations for almost 17 years and we love their food BUT to us and we have eaten in all their locations including NYC, the Chandler Blvd location is soooooo wonderful.  On our last visit we were treated to freshly roasted hatch chilies, green chili mac n cheese and all our other favorites. I live currently in New Mexico and still travel at least monthly to Phoenix. Our first stop is ALWAYS Los Dos for food and TLC from Cheryl and Brendt. Just for reference we happen to be foodies and travel mostly just to eat.  If you like your New Mexican food with lots of flavor and heat you cannot miss Los Dos."}
{"text":"Bland and boring food with poor service. Phoenix has a lot of great Mexican food restaurants, this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Burrito was gross, do not waste your time  They have no effort or passion to make great food. We will not be back"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food in a hole in the wall location.  Guacamole was good, chorizo dip was outstanding. Chile rellenos was good, beans and rice awesome."}
{"text":"For the price the food was good, not great.  The salsa is good but too hot. I like hot but I think being too hot masks the flavors.  The menu was \"temporary\" whatever that meant. They did not explain but it did seem very limited. Not sure why."}

{"text":"Apologize to LDM for the mindless review from Lee Chance aka Lee F  Lee has issues with me calling him out as a hack while attacking a competing business and Lee C has now taken his vendetta to hacking on my reviews of reputable establishments such as LDM.     LDM is  a premier New Mexican Cuisine establishment that can and will stand up to the most discerning tastebuds."}
{"text":"When your a New Mexican and you find New Mexican perfection you find your heart rate subsiding and your health meter rising and brother & sister i tell you now that LDM is the most OUTSTANDING New Mexican Food Restaurant in Arizona.....period dot!!!  My go to is the pork chimi or the muchaka chimi....either way it is the finest food in the valley!  We also LOVE the Green Chili Stew and the margarita's .        Best Mexican in Phoenix bar none!!  Any negative reviews usually come from jewish yentas that cannot stand the heat from cinnamon toothpaste let alone fresh New Mexican Green Chili.   Viva La Los Dos Molinos!!"}
{"text":"This is my sister and I's favorite place to go! Not only are they on the top 10 New Mexican places to eat in Phoenix but their staff is super friendly. THeir beef tacos are unreal and the La Rosa margarita will have you buzzed for hours. We're here weekly, this place is the best all around!"}
{"text":"I was in town for work and both a friend and colleague recommended Los Dos Molinos for spicy Mexican food. The guacamole was very good. I and the blue corn tamale which was ok but the taste of the tamale got lost in the spicy sauce. However the same cannot be said for the pork rib plate, a house specialty. It was spicy but excellent. Sweating and panting from the spice was well worth it for this dish. Everything was fairly inexpensive. And I sat outside since it was nice out."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I sat at the bar with a colleague for dinner. It was not busy, and it took a long time for a server or bartender to speak with us. When they did, the bartender was quite sullen and seemed to be angry to be there. We asked some questions about different entrees and drinks and were sometimes given no response! The guy seriously looked at us and just turned around to work on something else!! The chili problano was unnecessarily spicy (without warning) and at one point I was chocking on a piece of pepper. My colleague asked for water and the guy once again just walked away!!! I would not recommend this place. Food was ok, service was terrible."}
{"text":"Do you like it HOT?  If so, this is the place for you.  If not, well, there's always Taco Hell...  It's about the food.  It's New Mexican style, it's generally spicy, and it's the best in the Phoenix metro area. There are some kinda mild items on the menu, but if you're looking for mild, stop kidding yourself, look somewhere else.  If you're looking for medium, do yourself a favor, look somewhere else.  If you are looking for the best balance of heat and flavor in the region, this is the place for you!  The salsas are great (and available for take-out).  The carne adovada (anything) is fantastic.  And the margaritas are good.  The servers are polite, and the service is good (if occasionally a bit on the slow side), but this place is not about the service-- it's about the food.  Parking can be a bit inconvenient; you may have to park in back. It's location in a little auto strip-mall is a bit odd, but this could be ideal if you also needed to have some body work done, or you wanted to buy a custom motorcycle. But it's not about the parking, or the location-- it's about the food!  So what's it gonna be?  Flavor and heat?  Or something else..."}
{"text":"Firstly it not Mexican. It's New Mexican. Secondly. Its good. Very good. Almost everything is spicy hot but with care some items can be ordered that are not. This may actually be a five star place for food quality. It's close."}
{"text":"This place is the shiz, and we are so happy to have one right down the street from our humble abode.  Definitely New Mexican cuisine with green and red chile on pretty much everything.  I usually opt for the green chili cheese enchiladas, which have a awesomely spicy sauce, fresh thick corn tortilla and a fried huevo as the icing on the cake...so good!  Of course comes with rice and beans and is a healthy portion for the price.  Chips and salsa are superb and we debate each visit which is spicier, the red or the green.    I see a few bad-mediocre reviews of this place on Yelp and fools be trippin!  If you want spicy Mexican food, look no further than Los Dos Molinos, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos started as a small hole in the wall in Mesa and now has four locations throughout the valley.  (I even visited the NYC location a few times when they were open.)  The Mesa and south Central locations have been my favorites since the early 80's but I decided to give the Camelback location a try on this trip.  This location feels a bit more upscale than the Mesa location though still casual.  They have an awesome patio that is half covered.  All of their sauces of spices have heat so this isn't for anyone who only eats mild Mexican food.  However, it is not gratuitous heat but for flavoring.  I even add a little red and more of the green salsa to any dish I order.  My favorite has always been the smothered chimichanga.  However, trying to watch my waistline, I stick with the chile verde or burrito served enchilada style (smothered with green chile.  I check out new Mexican restaurants in every town.  However, Los Dos is the only restaurant I go to when in Phoenix."}

{"text":"Loved this. The pork is top quality. They have an adovada option by their salsa is so spicy (and delicious) I didn't think I could handle it. I got a pork tostada & pork taco. LOVED the pork tostada. My served was a total sweetheart. I love the license plates in here too. Lots of character in this place and totally delicious food"}
{"text":"Do not go to this place. Extremely rude. Went kind of late 8:20pm due to getting off of work late. Dominique who I found out is supposedly the owner said the kitchen closes at 9 and repeatedly told us and it closes at 9. Got charged $1.50 for and extra tortilla. She returned the $1.50 in cash and said I needed it more once I complained. I then went to write on the receipt why I was late and say customer service is important. She walked up to me and said if I'm writing something bad on the receipt that she's the owner and its going straight to her anyways. I then got up and turned my phone on to record to tell her that it's not ok to treat customers like that especially after spending $50 for 2 people. She said that customers shouldn't come towards closing time and I said then you should close at 8:30. She said bye and don't come back. I came back to tell her that I was recording the whole thing than Omar who works there said to put the phone away and I said why?  People need to know this is how the owner treats her customers. He said Fuck you and walked away in front of Dominique the owner. I would 100% not recommend this restaurant to anyone and they deserve to close down. Honestly who says don't come back and allows their staff to say fuck you. I have the video and will be posting it online soon. Hopefully it will catch on and put that place on the spotlight to know the CUSTOMER is important and without the customer they are nothing!!!!  Worst experience I've ever had. I was not the only customer who was upset and rushed off too that night."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch.  Had the enchilada dinner, great flavor, and a ton of beans.  Drink specials are good, food was great"}
{"text":"Food is tasty and the drinks are outstanding. Try the prickly pear margarita. Service is generally poor and keeps me from becoming more of a regular."}
{"text":"Wow, don't understand why everyone doesn't give this place 4-5 stars.  Other than Elote in Sedona, this is the best Mexican food  I have had in AZ.  First the atmosphere is fun, authentic and vibrant.  Our waiter was Mexican and excellent.  Finally I had an enchilada that had a homemade sauce.  Usually it is so thick that it tastes almost painted on.  Not here.  My daughters had burritos that were perfect.  We finished off the meal with heavenly sopapillas and ice cream.   I will come back here again and again.  It's excellent."}
{"text":"BEST. PLACE. EVER. The staff is SO friendly, the food and margaritas are amazing! My only (selfish) wish is that they would open on Sundays! Pleeeeeeeeease!"}
{"text":"This place used to be the bomb for HOT food. Our recent visit included poor service, bland salsa and really gross greasy tacos. Our table looked like had not been wiped down and our waiter didn't even acknowledge us. This was our main stay for delicious New Mexico hot chili but now it has been so gringoized (yes I know it not a real word) my 90 year old grandma could eat it. So disappointed  that they couldn't stay true to their roots. We will have to make do with trips to New Mexico for awesome chili."}
{"text":"Being from Texas, I am a fan of Tex-Mex which believe it or not, is hard to find in these parts.  Although not Tex-Mex, I had high hopes for Los Dos because of the rave reviews of my husband's friends and family.  Everyone was promising me this would be a break from the disappointing Mexican food I had tried in the valley.  So, off we go...and what a let down.  The food was okay, but definitely not all it was hyped up to be.  I love mouth scorching spicy food but you get the impression that the dishes have no flavor because of the overwhelming spicy flavor is all you can taste.  The service was virtually non-existant and we got the impression that we were a burden to the waitstaff by dining there.  So, the search continues..."}
{"text":"I love los dos! The foods is to spicy for my family so I usually order Togo I always get the same thing and the same gentlemen always take my order. I always order the same thing needless to say my order was not what I wanted so I took it back seemed like a simple enough mistake to me felt they would take the food and make it right but instead about 4 of the workers come up and start arguing with me asking do I wanna see the menu to which I say no.... it end me just saying give me my money back 16.50 which is high af for some enchiladas  but anyways  yeah they def lost a customer smh guess they don't value their neighborhood customers!"}
{"text":"Best. Mexican food. In. Arizona. Hands down!! Delicious margaritas and literally the best food. Get the queso and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Full of flavor all homemade and just excellent. Even when it's busy it's worth the wait!!! Excellent staff also! It's our favorite place and we will keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to eat here and finally did. They have a great little atmosphere and vibe going on. Service is great my only complaint is they don't have a milder salsa they are both really really green chili hot."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME!!! I went in solo for lunch the other day.  I sat at the bar and was greeted immediately with water, chips, and salsa.  The green salsa was super spicy and delicious while the red was more mild but still delicious.  I order the chile relleno and an enchilada.  The green chili sauce was fantastic, just enough kick to it. The cheese that they use there was some of the creamiest cheese I have ever had at a Mexican restaurant.  I would recommend this place to everyone!!! Great service, great food, and great people."}
{"text":"Pretty nice atmosphere.  Very nice waiting staff.  Food was ok.  We waited 40 minutes to get waters and chips and salsa.  Another 25 to have our order taken.  A family sitting next to us had received drinks but had waited 45 minutes and had not had order taken so they left.  We were pretty determined to eat there.  After we ate I had to track down a waiter so we could pay.  Maybe it was an off night but nobody who worked there seemed to know what was going on or how to get their job done.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Good New Mexican Food, speaking as a native. Ambience is a little business casual. They have a really excellent draft beer from Desert Eagle. The food is kinda pricey but they raise the bar on ingredients. Service was superb"}
{"text":"Food was just average, service was lax to non-existent. Never offered drink refills nor did the waiter check to see how we liked our food."}
{"text":"1st timers, enjoyed the free cheese crisp for checking in with. It was okay. The reviews are excellent but didn't feel the same.  Ordered a chimi and it was soggy and so doughy that I had to pick it apart. I prefer a crispier outside.  Best parts of the meal were the prickly pear margarita and the complimentary salsas.  Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Very unique setting, this place has the best Mexican food in Phoenix IMO."}
{"text":"This is simply a poor substitute for the Los Dos Molinos in South Phoenix.  It is a pale shade of itself.  The salsa is spicy, but it doesn't have any of the same excitement.  I think its partly the downtown location in a strip mall, (not that 98% of restaurants in Phoenix aren't in strip malls).  But the Mexcian Pizza and Chicken enchiladas just didn't have the same loving kick and spice.  When you are craving Mexican downtown, this'll do in a pinch.  But make room and time to head out to the original deal, the one with 5 alarm salsa and huge patios.  Margaritas the size of one's head and bring a group of friends to indulge!"}
{"text":"It's a bit cheesy with the garish colors and biker bar exterior..and all the foods runs spicy. But the food was top flight and the servers genuine rand kind. I had an enchilada that would make grandma cry..spectacular, and an amazing tamale."}
{"text":"Maybe it was my NY accent that caused them to tone down my food but it wasn't spicy. Thinking maybe me being a Northerner couldnt take their heat.  I went with my friend who swore up and down how spicy their food was. Maybe next time Ill let him order. That is only reason they lost a star. Green chile salsa is out of this world and has a great heat to it. I just wish the chile plate did the same. Carnitas platter was out of this world amazing. Pork cooked just right and super tender. Would definitely try again and hopefully they will bring on the heat!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Fat Tuesdays.  It's a place where tourists and college students go to get nasty drunk but don't expect good food.    The food is incredibly spicy but lacks quality and actual flavor.  It's as if they spiced up the food so they can sell you more margaritas.  If you wanna go just to get messed up on margaritas, which you kinda end up doing while you're waiting to either be seated or served your food, then the place is perfect for you.    Unless you're a tourist - don't expect any decent customer service.  The place is an old mortuary redone into a restaurant.  It needs some SERIOUS updating, hell, just get a hose and wash the inside clean!!  It's sticky and nasty!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Los Dos Molinos and it was muy sabroso!! I have wanted to eat here for awhile but was scared it would be too hot for me. However, after eating here, I would recommend this place for those who like it hotter than hell but also those who don't like it too spicy.   First off, the chips and salsa are delicious. The red salsa was pretty hot but the verde salsa was less hot and was just right for me. The margarita was really stiff and got me buzzed before dinner even came. I had one of the less hot items the los dos flautas dinner. The flautas were cooked perfect and I like that the beans are the whole pinto beans. My husband had the red chili. He said it was very flavorful and had just the right amount of heat."}
{"text":"Ok. This is the place for authentic Mexican food that does not cater to the old folk's tender palette. This is the real deal.  They are known for their Adovada. Get anything Adovada, you will not regret it.  I got the Machaca burro which was deliciously spicy, but be aware, I eat jalapeños raw on everything, so if you can't handle that much spice, try something else. This machaca was exactly how I had hoped it would be. Left me with a sweaty nose and a warm feeling in my belly. Despite being spicy, the meat was tender, juicy and flavourful!  My husband got the Adovada burro, and this is what they are known for. Holy crap the meat was so amazing I think I will only get that going forward.  Major flavour, major juice, succulent, fall apart, it actually makes you want to take an extra 20 seconds each bite just to savour the flavour. That's a rarity for me in Mesa.  Of course the house chips and salsas, well the salsas, are amazing. The red is hotter than the green, but know that when you get a sauce on your plate, this reverses. The green sauce is hotter than the red. They have daily specials, and their happy hour is 11-6!  Go. Go now. It's everything you hoped it would be."}
{"text":"This location is definitely owned by the family member that doesn't give a shit.  ZERO authenticity, zero flavour, zero service, zero in all categories.  The chips that were delivered to the table were old, and the salsas were meh.  If I want 3 week ago chips, I'll go to my pantry and dig in the very back. Gross. They delivered the wrong meal to my husband, and then after correction it, blamed us because they 'heard wrong'.  That left me with my super sub par burro, which honestly, Filabertos makes a far superior burrito.  Slow service, bland food, please don't come here and think you're going to get authentic Mexican food. You will be SADLY disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was okay. I got the green chili plate and it was not spicy at all. It was real greasy. Maybe it was an off day. I will have to try it again to make sure"}
{"text":"Ok so this place is controversial... You either love it or hate it.  The food is GREAT, especially if you love SPICY food. The menu marks the stuff that is hot, and it is no joke, its HOT. But very tasty. The hottness kind of depends on the day I have found, some days it like liquid magma, and otheres its got a good kick. I have had the Adobada ribs, the enchiladas, the machaca, the chimichanga. All good. Sometimes the beans are even spicy. You can get your meals with either red or green chile, I am told that the green is hotter, but that is up for debate.  On to the not so good: The service is at best mediocre, especially if they are busy and its a weekend. Dont go here if you are in a hurry. But for us, the food is worth the bad service. Consider yourself warned... Also they dont have much of a kids menu, our 2 year old has snacked on rice and beans (when the beans are not spicy) and a cheese crisp and the rolled tacos on occasion. Thats about the extent of it, everything else is spicy.  This is not completely authentic mexican food, its more of a southwestern flare. No carne asada here.  The Kick-Ass Margarita is awesome (so my husband says) and I like the Sangria and the Sangria Margarita. Margatitas overall are good here."}
{"text":"By far the worst Mexican I have ever had and Mex is my staple. Sat down to a filthy fork on the napkin.  We both ordered the chili relleno ala carte.  When they brought it it looked like a platter of soup along with \"tortillas\" that looked more like greasy large pancakes. My first bite was so hot I could not feel my lips.  The  unskilled waiter came over and I told him my delema, his response was the menu said it was hot (which it didn't)  I told him neither one of us could eat it and he said that everything on their menu was super hot including a machaca taco.   I again told him we could not eat this fire on our plate so he proceeded to produce the bill charging us full price for everything even tho neither one of us had a full bite of food.   I have never experienced anything like it. Great customer service!  By the looks of the limited lunch crowd I don't think we are alone on the opinion of Los Dos."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic. The chips and salsa are good and the food was not disappointing. The server did get the order completely wrong and the staff seemed less than interested, but the meal was still good. The older pueblo aesthetic setting was neat. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Do not eat here believing you will be receiving anything close to the deliciousness as the original Los Dos Molinos (South Mountain location) .   For the price I expect better quality food.  I'd rank this place no higher than a 24hr fast food drive thru.  Our beans and rice were at least 3 days old.   The blue corn tortillas for the enchiladas were DYED, they were florescent green. The manager blew us off when we brought it to his attention.   My beef tacos were 3/4 beans and topped off with a few shreds of beef.   Last but not least the margaritas were awful, I'm sorry but I do not want orange juice in my drink.  How does a Mexican restaurant screw that drink up?"}
{"text":"Spicy, Spicy, Spicy. If you are a lover of spicy New Mexican cuisine this is definitely the spot to try. Make sure to have enough beverages nearby to help with the spicy mouth feeling. I have had just about every dish on the menu and have never been disappointed. Stop by and give it a try!!"}
{"text":"I am going to catch some heat (pun intended) on this one as LDM is considered a sacred cow in this town. I just think it is average and I don't like the location and I am not that impressed with the service. Being a native New Mexican, who knows a tremendous amount about Rio Grande - Nuevo Mexican cuisine and even more about New Mexico chiles (Hatch, Dixon, Espaola, Chimayo, Mesilla Valley, Socorro, Pecos Valley, etc), as well as, the heirloom chile's of the Pueblos and truck farms. You name it, I have been eating them for 42 years by the bushel.  I enjoy the pungent flavor of the LDM chile relleno plate that I always have when I've dined there, but I believe the chiles are Mexican. Nothing wrong with Mexican chiles as I love them, BUT I think it is wrong to call the chiles \"New Mexican\" if they are not. I have had New Mexico chiles there in my dish, but I have had others as well. I can discern the difference and would not claim it if I could not definitively state so. It's like saying here is your glass of Burgundy when your serving a Pinot Noir from the Languedoc. Both are French Pinot Noirs, but they definitely don't taste the same. It is a matter of nuance, and one has a higher market value to consumers. I believe it would be logistically impossible for a restaurant like LGM to only feature New Mexico chiles year round in Phoenix. As well as, their sister restaurants in NYC, Mesa, and Springerville, AZ.  The expense of the amount they would need would be astronomical based on the amount of covers they do. It would require the Franzoy's or Lyttle's entire chile crop to satisfy the demand.  Let's face it even if you froze a container of chiles for your restaurant to use, thawed chiles suck compared to savory fresh roasted! My other complaint is owner - mangaer, Cheryl is flat out rude and obnoxious. Friendly and hospitable is the absolute manner in New Mexico (not Santa Fe faux wannabes) cafes and restaurants. She has snapped at me on one occasion and was curt and unresponsive on others. Most New Mexico style restaurateurs would not be taking shopping junkets to Paris and driving canary yellow Corvettes either. You see being wound up on fashion and MAC cosmetics are not typical attributes of New Mexico food...it is simply red or green or \"Christmas\" on fancy occasions. Comida Deluxe is all about the food. The other serious complaint I have is the terrible Margaritas...reading the other Yelpers go on and on about how great they are makes me scratch my head. Cheap mixto Tequila and bad triple sec makes bad Margarita. Period! Sure if my choice is between Arribas or Los Dos it is a no-brainer...do the Dos. However, both thrive on gimmick of fabled New Mexico food. If you want some simple New Mex, go to Si Senor on Alma School. Cheap, fast and friendly.  By the way, I am not attempting to get all Diane Kennedy on you but the food at LDM is not authentic Mexican cuisine! It is Border American at its' best. I am sure that the recipes are traditional to Chef  Victoria's' family and authentic to their culture. The cuisine in New Mexico is not authentic Mexican cuisine either. Neither is Tex-Mex or California Mission examples of AUTHENTIC Mexican. Just like a German National would not recognize a Chicago hot dog as authentic German cuisine even though German immigrants created the Frankfurter. I did not see any Sicilians eating Spagetti and Meatballs last time I was in Vittoria on wine business."}
{"text":"Sangria margarita MF! I seriously love it so much. And Los dos is spicy AF on most of their menu items. I don't mind that one bit. Amazing green chile and salsa. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"I love creative, authentic Mexican food. I don't like many Mexican restaurants. But this one is a good one I think!   First trip here, but  I like the ambience, and the New Mexico Green Chili Stew was very good.  Got the smaller portion, and made two great meals out of it. A tad on the spicy side, but just within my spice level limitations.  (I would have preferred a tad less spice-truth be known).   The chips and salsa were great...that's important! Service was great too. Friendly and attentive.  The menu looked creative and delicious, and I will return again!"}
{"text":"Fabulous hot and flavorful Mexican food and exceptionally rude service. If only the waiters were not obnoxious perhaps they would get more stars in my book."}
{"text":"Gave the new location on Warner a try last nite and will never go back. Horrible service, totally non-attentive, dirty, unorganized. Can't believe they're in business. Margaritas were a joke. They need some serious help, not my problem."}
{"text":"I really like the food and table service here but tonight we had to wait a little while for our table so we went to the bar. That's where we had our problems. We asked about the different margaritas and the bartender explained them. We said that we wanted the fresh margaritas and he pointed us to the ones on the menu where the pitchers were $29. We asked for grand marnier as a floater. We had two pitchers and the bill was $120!!  This just doesn't make sense. The manager came over and worked it out as a misunderstanding but threw in the shot, enjoy your margaritas. Then, some jerk that was sitting next to us very loudly said oh is there a problem with their bill, I will cover it. He implied that we couldn't pay for our tab so I promptly informed the guest that we could pay for our bill, thank you very much but we were told one price and then charged double for what we ordered. Not the restaurants fault of the jerk trying to show off but it is their fault for trying to rip us off at the bar.  After that, table service and food was great."}
{"text":"I would have rated Los Dos Molinos a strong 5 stars if it weren't for the service.  In the three times I have been to this restaurant, the service has been so-so.  There is usually no one in the front to greet you and it does take a few minutes for the server to come to the table.  However, the food does not disappoint!  It is certainly spicy, but the spice does not mask the flavors.  I have had the adovada tamale, the machaca burro and the relleno dinner.  Every dish has been exceptional and the people I have been there with have also thoroughly enjoyed their food.  I would certainly recommend this restaurant to others, just beware that, a) you'll need patience and b) your sinuses will be cleared."}
{"text":"I gave it 4 starts ONLY because of the food, NOTHING else. If the service, restaurant decor etc was good too, it would have 5 starts. 5 Starts for food, 2 stars for service, and 2 for restaurant overall. I never been here until some co workers told me about it. I went the 1st time with some co workers. a good party of 8 people. I read other review, it looks like an italian restaurant. You could tell they did nothing well at all to open it. Lobby is TINY. Decor sucks. dining room too quiet and full with no music, TV or anything. Silence. Food was GREAT! Warning though, everything is really spicy!! but it is so good. LOVE the salsa. i had a red chile burrito with chicken, AMAZING. i wish I had more rice on the plate, but good. Still have their weird \"temp\" menu, but still good choices.   I just went again last night with my partner. The waiter who was also the bartender, I believe ignored us because he went to a table of 4 before us and we were way before. the bus boy took care of us, beginning to finish. the bartender, waiter guy came over once to see if we were doing okay and we said yes so thats how I could tell he was supposed to take care of us. He asked if the other guy helped us. a few younger \"servers\" walk around there with shorts, toms and side way hats. I like the casual atmosphere of staff, but when you have no personality and no interest in helping, it doesnt make it more fun.   Come here for the food, NOT the service. it lacks really quite a bit. No one was rude, just are bland as a robot.   Looking forward to going back. I may try the PHX or Alma School one to compare."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment while on a working trip. We were undecided on what to have for dinner, that as my boss called out a bunch of cuisines. I figured because we were in the Southwest, we decided on Mexican cuisine.  Los Dos Molinos is one of his favorites, so we picked up my co-worker from the other hotel and off to LDM it was, but only after having to sit in a little bit of traffic.  I can't say for sure, but based on my AZ co-workers and this restaurant, I get that AZ loves spicy. Whew! I can handle mild, but I think mild in AZ is moderate in other states. I learned this early while having chips and salsa.  For my meal, I ordered the chicken chimichanga while my boss ordered the pork burrito and my co-worker ordered the pork enchiladas. The servings is huge as I could only eat half. Thank goodness my room has a fridge and microwave.  The rice and beans were cooked well and I thought was very good.  My dish was flavorful, but not spicy. The meal was alright the next day. My boss and co-worker liked their dish a lot. My boss did think his dish wasn't spicy enough even though I could see him sweating a bit.   Customer service was fantastic. And the atmosphere/decor we thought was interesting and yet comfortable. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Los dos is my favorite place in Phoenix without question.  It's hot... So be ready.  The food is authentic new mexican style cuisine and its amazing.  Margaritas are not too shabby either... Best of all this place has character!"}
{"text":"Omg bomb!!! Amazing flavor. Extremely hot not for the faint of heart.   We got adovada casserole and the garlic pork Christmas style everything top notch!!!   Will for sure return!!!"}
{"text":"Moved to Mesa a Year ago. Best Mexican Food in Mesa. The Garlic Pork Dinner I will order again & again. My wife has eaten Flaunts all over the US. That is really all she orders. She loved it. Will be back. The $25 Top Shelf.Margarita a Knock Out For Two. Loved the Collection of Kachina Dolls, Indian & Mexician Art around the Restaurant."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere and nice waiters, but the food veered toward flavorless slop. Even the \"cheeezy\" dip, yes, cheeezy with 3 Es, was watered down."}
{"text":"Hot...REALLY REALLY HOT food.  I went with someone who knows authentic Mexican food and she said it was good.  I enjoyed it, but damn...HOT."}
{"text":"Ok, if you don't like the heat- stay the hell out of the kitchen!  Mexican food is supposed to be spicy and HOT!  This place definitely delivers the heat, I mean their chili's really pack a punch, they way it should be.  Yes, it is one of those hole in the wall places, so if you prefer a squeaky clean and modern establishment, go eat some bland wanna be Mexican food in Scottsdale and pay for the ambience.  The salsa's here are really good and flavorful.  Enchiladas, rice, and beans - YUM!  The Posole is right on the money, so delicious and full of flavor.  If you like it hot (the food) and you aren't going out to eat to be dazzled by the establishment then give it a shot, but go with the right expectations or just don't bother because it clearly isn't for everyone."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!! This place is disgusting! The tablecloth makes me want to throw up just thinking about it. There was nasty food all over it and they obviously have not been washed in a while (if ever). The food came straight from serving dishes and the microwave. The service sucked really  bad. We had a Groupon and even with that our bill was over $40 for just two people and I had water to drink and my husband just had a pop. It is awkward that the waiter is hovering over you while you put your tip into the iPad they run your card on. I didn't want to leave any but I cannot be THAT mean.  It is WAY over priced! I wish I did not have to leave any stars for this place. Go to Taco Bell over this place. Awful."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area way too long to not have ever been to this restaurant.  Met up with friends for Saturday dinner to rectify that.  Adovada tamales were, of course, spicy but also quite flavorful.  Some of the best chips and salsa I have ever had and I can verify that the Kick-Ass Margarita is aptly named.  Great food, great service, great experience."}
{"text":"A disclaimer: I worship this place. I made sure it was the last (New) Mexican food I had before leaving the southwest for several months. The South Mountain location is better (because the kitsch factor is higher, and they *really* don't hold back on the heat there... or the booze), but this is still a home run.  I'v eaten here more times than I can count. If you're not into spice, there are a few things on the menu, but you're missing the magical dishes and I'd recommend going somewhere a bit more... mild. As someone who has an unhealthy love for spicy... It's adovada at its apex. Terrific tamales. Salsa that leaves you longing for its bite. Love.  And the margaritas and sangria are deadly strong. If you care about such things."}
{"text":"From the outside this looks like a very authentic Mexican place, I was let down  by my experience. Compared to Serrano's, La Fonda, Arriba's, Garcia's, and otherd here is how I felt:  * Small portions * Expensive pricing * There chips and salsa: Red sauce is extremely hot, too hot fkr me. Green salsa is mild-medoum,but has a sweetness to it - aka threre is no mild-medium salsa that isn't sweet * Playing Queen, 50's, etc. I like a little bit more of a mexican feel with music"}
{"text":"Los dos!!! Love it super cool little spot in the heart of uptown Phx. It's a little Mexican spot with good old style homemade food !! Also love the beer selection Drew the manager good guy ! Was going around and entertaining the guest and was really engaged with everyone ! Good music in the background. Spicey!!! Was my type for sure salsa was seriously the best I have ever had and couldn't stop thinking about for the entire night! A must try if ur in the mode for Mexican!"}
{"text":"Delicious spicy New Mexico style food. I'm used to traditional Az style, but every time friends or business associates come in to town, we make a trip here! Machaca chimi with green sauce is super spicy, but fantastic!"}
{"text":"We had a work dinner held at this restaurant, I heard good things about them, spicy food and authentic taste. Grant it I do eat at a lot of Mexican restaurant so what may be authentic to me may not be for others. Food was very blan not spicy at all... we ordered the chorizo dip and you would have to be pretty new to Mexican food to not realize that it's canned chili.  The worst part were the employees, I have never been to a place where I felt I was the one serving them. Some of us were there a little early so we sat at a table and ordered drinks, we literally had a waiter tell us that they had other people to wait on and that we would have to order the drinks from the front in a rude manner. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. Many other restaurants in the valley with better food and better service."}
{"text":"Excellent margaritas and sopapillas. Otherwise, very underwhelming entrees. Very white washed New Mexican food with not much flavor. Maybe it was the fact we came in with a big group or the restaurant seemed understaffed but service was something to be left desired. Would give it another chance based on recommendation and maybe ask them to step up the chili a notch"}
{"text":"I was glad to hear that Los Dos had opened a restaurant in Chandler.  As always, the food is only good if you like it hot and choices for those that don't are limited.  However, the restaurant is nice, the service is great and the food is, well, hot.  If you like any of the other Los Dos locations, you will not be let down by this one."}
{"text":"I have seen this restaurant maybe 250 times, my aunt lives around the corner. So my husband and I were in the neighborhood and wanted Mexican food, we were on our way to La Canasta on 7th street but they do not have strong drinks so I suggested we stop in.  When you enter it feels like you have been transported to a little Villa. So we sit down the place is half full. There was this man literally licking his plate,  I was thinking damn is the food that good.  So we ordered beer ritas. We asked our waiter about the hottest dish they had.  He pointed out a couple but they had spicy boneless ribs on the menu so I asked, \"what kind of Mexican restaurant has ribs?\" He said it was not Mexican it is New Mexico cuisine.  I was thinking in my head what is the difference, because he said it with so much pride.  So I studied the \"New Mexico\" menu and order a burrito...lol. my husband got some spicy Shrimp dish. The chips and salsa came out with the beer ritas which only come frozen. The salsa was so spicy and delicious maybe top 3 salsa I have ever eaten.  The drink was full of goodness. The food came out quick.  It was so goood and I added that spicy salsa it was over the top. Then the bill came it was 19.00. I thought it was a mistake. I asked my husband to guess how much he said 50.00. We were thrilled.  We saw a couple eating sopapias spelling my b off. So we ordered some they were fresh and sweet and good and...you get the picture.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"If you like spicy this is the place for you.  The carne adovado relleno's are to die for!  The central Phoenix one has moved up on Camelback and about 10th street, a couple doors down from Oregano's.  So you have two great choices just a few feet apart!"}
{"text":"Wow we just ate here last night and it was really good with good service. If you like spicy food don't miss out on this place!  The carne adovada relleno is wonderful.  My wife had a special they had for mothers day and she said it was one of the best meals ever.     Honestly don't know what happened on the nights where others gave bad reviews it was most certianly not our experience."}
{"text":"You like rellenos? You like spicy? Los Dos has THE dish for you.  The adovada relleno is a must try.  Not for those afraid of a little heat though so beware!"}
{"text":"Red or green?  Yes!  I had no idea that I would like New Mexican food so much! Further, I had no idea that \"New Mexican\" food was a thing.  A friend of mine in Buffalo, NY recommended this place to me a few years ago & I've been carrying that around in my mind ever since.  This was my first trip to Phoenix since he told me about this.  I had just a little bit of hard time convincing my friends & family to try this place but none of us was disappointed!    The food is delicious  :)  Try the salsas prior to ordering so that you'll know how you want your food prepared.  The service was great.  Our waiter took the time to explain everything to us & was very attentive to our requests (my wife orders food like Meg Ryan from \"When Harry Met Sally\" - ugh).  If you don't like spicy food then you should just leave now, you'll be sorry if you don't.  I have a friend who can't eat too much black pepper - she would probably explode if she ate here."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing restaurant to say the least.  The Host staff was very unfriendly and our Waiter was on his I-pad the whole time he was speaking to us and looked at us 2X - what a terrible way to start off the evening.  I should of ran than.  I ate the HOT red salsa and the HOTTER Green Salsa - only reason why I gave it 1 star- love the heat.  I ordered the bean burrito and my better half ordered the cheese enchiladas.  Poor to the taste and would of rather of gone to Macyo's and that is bad- I know!!!!  Stay away from Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"Spicy. And I mean: SPICY!!!!  And it is very tasty too!  We had:  cheese dip - it was delicious and spicy. Green corn tamale - best I ever had! - but so spicy, I almost died. Chilly relleno - yeah. Chimichanga Adovada with green sauce - my husband was crying and eating and crying and eating... even a side of sour cream had a garlic in it. We will be back for sure, but only after we forget the pain"}
{"text":"Ummmmm I'm not sure if the people have had good Mexican before, buuuuut this place is definitely NOT good. Their margaritas are made with lime koolaid. The guacamole is store bought. And not just like ok let's use it as a base and then spruce it up before we serve it NO they walked over to basha's opened a container of wholly guacamole and slapped it on a plate! There ya go! So disappointed! We asked for more chips and they never came so we couldn't even finish our $7 store bought guacamole. THEN to top it off...... we were asked to leave our table because we were done eating and just watching the live band but the \"waiter needed to seat someone else\" I've never been asked that in my entire life."}
{"text":"Awesome food, spectacular service. The location on Central Ave has always been a favorite of mine, now we have one closer to home! We had the Shrimp Veracruz and the Chicken Chimichanga both were great, if you don't like spicy dishes, and both of these are, they have other great options!  We will be back over and over!"}
{"text":"I like Los Dos Molinos.  A restaurant.com offer got me there in the first place.  I thought the food was good and selection was fine.  The two salsas brought with our chips were spicy and spicier.  I would have preferred a non-spicy or citrus salsa with the spicy one.  Our food was good. I ordered a raspberry margarita, which was not very raspberryish.  When the manager came around to ask if everything was ok, I mentioned my drink.  He took it away and when it came back it was delicious.  For dessert, I recommend the Sopapilla with honey.  A little messy but oh so tasty!   There were 5 in our party and we were surprised that they added 18% gratuity.  Our server was very good and we probably would have given him 20% had they not taken the liberty of adding it on already."}
{"text":"This is an iconic Phoenix restaurant with a number of locations.   I wish this was a better review but my group of four were disappointed. we ordered a guacamole appetizer which consisted of one small scoop of DELICIOUS guacamole.  Chips were fresh fried and Delicious. But came in a small bowl that we had to keep requesting to be refilled Dinner came accompanied by tasteless beans and rice that we joked was al dente with our waiter.  We enjoyed the garlic shrimp but it wasn't anything to jump with excitement.  Other guests had Adams flautas they tried both chicken and beef they really liked therm but they too had hard rice and tasteless beans.  Enough said. Restaurant has great space, service was warm and friendly and attentive.  We will try it again because we are all allowed an off night."}
{"text":"After our last visit to Los dos, it will be a very long time before I attempt to come back.  Sure, yes, the food is really good....if you have the patience to wait over an hour after you wait 30 minutes to actually order. It took over two hours to have a simple dinner. We were seated right away and brought chips and salsa and water, but didn't see our server for over 20 minutes.   The problem is that they don't have a wait. They sit everyone that comes in the door because they have the room, but they are so understaffed it's insane. We ran out of chips, water and margaritas and were never asked if we would like anything else. I'm a patient person but I was so close to walking out because I was so hungry.  Only after our meal and when it came time to pay did the server come back around. This place needs some real training, and they need to hire more servers and cooks. The experience was highly unexceptable."}
{"text":"You better like it spicy. So good. Every time I come here I am not disappointed. Everything is fresh and made daily."}
{"text":"After moving from Ct. LDM was recommened.  3yrs now and LDM is still our favorite.  There are too many great resturants in the greater Phoenix area yet this location of LDM is our top choice.  Love the atmosphere, crisps, taco salad, chimy,  all items make my mouth water.  New Mexico cusine is a favorite, LDM a great time.  Thank you LDM."}
{"text":"Food was not that good.   Staff was not that friendly.   And I guess it's NEW Mexican Mexican food?   And for the love of God, don't ask for mild sauce. You would have thought I asked for baby tigers blood."}
{"text":"This place is OK, a little pricey for what you receive, seriously, over 2$ for a side of sour cream. Haven't been blown away by anything here, not a huge fan of their rice and beans, but their shredded beef burrito wasn't bad. I'd go here again if someone else wanted to, but otherwise it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Yes, I finally made it to the legend, the Molinos of 2!  Found a seat at the bar and ordered a cold beer and anticipated the amazing food to come!  Ordered an appetizer of what turned out to be a plate of ground chorizo.  Chorizo looked like ground beef, served with chips....yup, that's it...Ground chorizo to scoop onto a tortilla chip.  OK.  Mentally, I throw it out and order a different app...  This time I order what should be some variant of chile con queso.....Not as bad as the chorizo but still not edible.  At this point I pay and peace out.  Bummed for sure.  Los Dos two-app strike out."}
{"text":"Worst food ever!  I used to eat at los Dos years ago and although their food was spicy..their food was good and margaritas great!  Today....the food was horrible..the margarita was horrible!  OMG!!! Alot if money for horrible food and drink!  The waiter was great!! That was the only redeeming grace!"}
{"text":"Me n the wifey came to Los Dos when her co-workers recommended it to her....I dont mind trying new places.....but it was a so so place....we went on a Saturday afternoon....not many people...nice place....quiet.....I had the Carnitas plate n the wifey had the Flautas.......the Carnitas were excelent....beans were good....rice was bland with no taste.......over all it was an ok meal....the service was ok."}
{"text":"Los Dos is many an Arizona native's favorite Mexican food place. And it has the (well-deserved) reputation for the spiciest food around! They also have a hoppin' cantina.  There is a lot of tragedy and triumph behind the Los Dos Molinos franchise. Owners Victoria and Eddie have turned to food and work as a way through the grief of loosing two children in two separate car accidents. Today, the family business is bigger and better than ever-- with the newest location opened by a daughter in New York City!"}
{"text":"I am a repeat customer. I have been going to Los Dos for many years and have always been satisfied, until last Saturday. We were a group of 6 who arrived early in the evening. We were seated very promptly, ordered drinks and our meals. That's when things went bad. Our Waiter completely disappeared on us leaving us with empty drinks. When the food came, one of our party had no food which took an additional 30 minutes to correct. I will say that, as always the food was exceptional. However the service was awful for the first time since I have dining there over a 12 year period. I hope it's a time anomaly."}
{"text":"Loved the place! I had some Pork roast awesomeness, and the chili-dip both really good. As tasty as the food was, there was way more than I could eat. We also got an unknown number of margarita pitchers that just kept coming. Needless to say, next time I'm in Mesa, this is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Need a little spice in your life then come here!!!! Yummoo to spicy Mexican food!!! This place is very good!!! We love it!  My favourites are the Adovoda burrito and green chili stew! You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Had heard many good things about this place and finally visited for lunch yesterday. I came in with low expectations which were met with patio furniture from Pick Up Stix which went bust awhile ago. That made me giggle. The decor is definitely hodge-podgetastic.   We were greeted and seated in the main dining room. It wasn't very crowded and our waiter was right on top of us. The red and green salsas that came with the chips were fantastic, and the chips were warm but not sure if they were super fresh. Still, I had no problem mowing them down. I ordered a fresh margarita and it was huge, delicious and fresh. Very good marg! One was plenty, they don't skimp on the booze! I went with the Adovada Enchilada dinner because i was told that this was the thing to get. I ordered it Christmas style which I learned meant red and green sauce. This was a very good dish. Its not the traditional enchilada in the sense that the meat was wrapped up. The chunky and flavorful pork was ladled on top of this maybe 1/2 inch thick tortilla cake...for lack of a better word. Covered with red and green sauce and a sexy little fried egg. I will take an egg on pretty much anything. I ate the entire enchilada and a bit of the rice and beans. Next time I would skip the rice and beans and just order ala carte. We had a group of 6 and they added 18% gratuity to our bill.  Solid spot, i will be back with the hubs in tow."}
{"text":"Best Pork Carnita's I have ever had. They were gotk tender with alot of flavor and served with pinto beans and Spanish rice. Got there early enough that there was no wait. Of course had to get the kick ass margaritas. Very tasty. Great local restaurant in South Phoenix."}
{"text":"I  am a vegetarian for health reasons and have never had any problems.  The food is consistently very good.  Hot and is loaded with flavor.  The service is friendly and professional.  I go there often and will continue for years to come."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place a few months back from someone who used to live in the area. She had said if you like food with heat you must come here. When we got to town we met up with a friend who lives here now. he said this was the place to eat. It is an experience. I wish I could have captured everything on video and posted it. My descriptions will not do this place justice. There is an outdoor patio area with all kinds of wall art, a fountain, 6-7 tables. We sat out there. Our server mentioned that they are known for their pork dishes, so this is what I tried. The pork was wonderful. I was very concerned about getting something too spicy, but our server just said to stay away from any thing labeled with chiles and I'd be fine. The portions were perfect. They serve margaritas by the pitcher. Los Dos is a must go if you're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"For those of you that like spicy food this is an AWSOME place!    The food is very good & spicy but if you are not into spicy just tell them.  The place is a whole in the wall? Aren'th best Mom &Pop places like that?  : )."}
{"text":"Los Dos was not up to par today. Green chile sauce had a strange lumpy consistency and the carne adovada was dry. The chicken in the chimichangas was tough, dry, and hard to swallow. The fire in the chile sauces was still present, but that was about all that was good. Man, even the corn chips served with the salsa were stale. What's happening? Hope this is not the start to a downward spiral for what has been such a reliably great New Mexican style restaurant for many years. Fix it guys, please."}
{"text":"Chips salsa food drinks service seating ...... All get 6 stars"}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos was recommended to my friend and me by a taxi cab driver. It was probably one of the best recommendations I've received in a very long time. The food was flavorful and delicious, ambiance was festive and our server Mikey was friendly and hospitable. Everything we were looking for was found and explored at Los Dos Molinos!!! Authentic experience! Excellent margaritas... Thank you, Jorge, for this recommendation!!!"}
{"text":"Last night I received some of the worst customer service of my life at Los Dos Molinos - Ahwatukee. The GM was our waiter (black shirt and handle bar mustache) but didn't offer his name. I ordered a dish that did not have cheese listed on the menu (the flautas) and asked for no sour cream. I have a slight dairy allergy so I thought that was good. The food comes and I notice there is cheese on the flautas. I apologize to the kitchen staff for not knowing and asked if I could get it without cheese thinking that would be the end of it. I had never been there before and the other places I had ordered the same dish from didn't have cheese. Honest mistake... Well the GM comes over and sits down in our booth and says in a very condescending tone \"something wrong? We need to have a chat\" and lectured me on why it was my fault for not knowing that everything on the menu comes covered in cheese. Keep in mind that many dishes listed cheese under the ingredients but this one did not. He was extremely rude during the whole exchange. He then proceeds to make a loud obvious jab at us when taking the order at the table next to us. \"Thanks for voicing your preferences now instead of after you get your food. Saves us all time!\" The sad part is he obviously knew he was wrong or at least that we were upset because he never came back to our table. I went up to the bar to ask him for our check and he proceeded to avoid me and briskly walk to the back of the restaurant. Another much friendlier waiter helped us out. The rest of the staff was great and the food was good but I cannot believe someone who is in a position of leadership talks down to customers like that.   The extremely poor service outweighs any food quality in my book so this one gets a one-star and no repeat business. It was not just our table either. He talked down to everyone when taking orders. He either needs a lesson in customer service or a new job!"}
{"text":"I'm an Arizonian (born and raised in the valley for over 20 years), and this is my favorite restaurant OF ALL TIME. Now, let me start with the best part of Los Dos: The service. It's literally always the same people. I've been coming to this location for several years now; you will not be treated like cattle here. It's like going to grandma's house and having the most amazing meal prepared for your family. Be patient and enjoy the food if it's your first time coming here, because everything comes out hot & fresh.   Second: The Legendary Spicy Machaca Pizza (They should really update their menu to say that). This pizza is better than sex. If you *think* you like mexican or machaca pizza because you've ordered it at other restaurants, prepare for your expectations to be DEMOLISHED after ordering the Legendary Machaca Pizza, because no other restaurant will even come *close* to this.... this....... *drools*... LEGENDARY MACHACA PIZZA!   Third: The people who complain about \"it was spicier than I thought omg this was horrible there was no warning\" or \"omg anything on the menu that is supposed to be not spicy... like the chicken, is bland!\" that's because Los Dos practically punishes you for \"not ordering spicy\". Even if you don't do your online research first to see what kind of restaurant this is... Even before you get seated, there is a literal sign on the front door that says SOME LIKE IT HOT!, oh, and don't mind all the decor in the restaurant (chiles, peppers, etc), and somewhere on the menu, they actually warn you that the food is spicy, and yes if you order it, you get to pay for it.  LOS DOS MOLINOS! YOU'RE THE BEST, KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING."}
{"text":"Best carnitas EVER!!!! I was able to cut it with a butter knife!!!! Effing loved it!!! I will edging be back!!! I would have taken a pic but I didn't think about it until I woofed down this delicious dish!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is really, no really really good..I wanted to take another plate home with me but refrained (since I was with a group).  I has the enchilada dinner and it was plate licking good..I ate everything..even the beans which my boyfriend reminded that I don't like beans.  The salsa verde I could drink by the gallon and the margarita packed a punch without tasting overwhelmingly like tequila...I will be dreaming about this place until I can go back...Saturday afternoon...no wait/line...great service too!"}
{"text":"We love the food here. Unfortunately this time, we were treated so rudely! We came for a business dinner with people we are fond of, we put our names on the seating list, seating 4. We were told 20 minutes.  We grabbed a drink at the bar35 to 40 minutes later I inquire the hostess about the time.  I saw the waiting  list and a party of 4, who had came in after us m, but were seated before us, when I pointed out this fact she said that they were VIP and we were not! Wow !"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with the service tonight. They are just far too understaffed. I am in service and I sympathize but if you don't have the staff then don't take more tables. It took a solid 20 min for them to even take our order and it was 45 minutes from then to get our food. They never checked on us and we had to ask 3 times for a to-go container. The food was OK, not anything to go back for. And I will definitely avoid in the future cause the service was so bad. My advice to management, get some more servers on and install a computer system so you don't have to keep writing checks for the kitchen by hand."}
{"text":"I'm very hard to please as a chef and culinary in. Service was fantastic, food was amazing, atmosphere was Electric. This'll be my Friday night spot from now on with my wife. Coming from Tucson and having good Mexican food this is the first place I can honestly say I feel good and can't wait to come back and try another dish."}
{"text":"I have to say that I have only eaten here once, but the food was great. I love spicy food. It was definitely not too hot for me. The service was excellent and very prompt. We did get there about five o'clock and were among the first customers of the evening. By the time we were done the place was starting to fill up and I would expect to wait a bit longer if we had come in at that time.  They do serve whole beans which were very tasty.    The salsas are on the hot side, but that is what I would expect, too many Mexican restaurants serve bland tomato concoctions especially in recent years."}
{"text":"Good God, I hate this place.  Its one thing to dork out about your product, but to go over-the-top with it is just unnecessary.  What I mean is, they  make their food so fucking spicy, I want to punch myself in the balls in an attempt to disperse the pain throughout my entire body rather than letting it linger in the locus of angry hornets that have nested in my mouth.  And yes, I love spicy Mexican food.  I grew up in a border town for Christo's sake.  This IS NOT Mexican food.  Its a gimmick.  Genuine Mexican food is supposed to be subtle in heat and grow throughout the dish.  One should be able to taste the layered spices and complex ingredients.  Mexican food takes a lot of effort and time to make and should be complimented by a thorough savoriness by the consumer.    Their food must suck, but you'd never know it because it is so fully disguised by the Dos Molinos people, who drop a nuclear bomb on your head and ask you if you want to order another Dos XX.  My only compliment is the patio and the fact that they serve Mexican beer, which we all know is the cure for radioactive exposure."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a local place and heard good things. The place is modest with a friendly staff. For the love of jesus, if you can't take heat, do not eat here! The posole was amazing and you NEED to try the homemade tortillas! A bit different than the posole I'm used to but this is a new mexican style restaurant so it's a bit off from the mexican food I'm used to from chicago. Overall a good experience and will definitely come again!!"}
{"text":"Um, yeah, \"meh\" says it best... it's a step up from saying worse things I suppose!  4-star food, 1-star service, VERY limited & pricey menu.  I ordered a combo platter, a taco, cheese enchilada, rice & beans: $12-bucks.  Their salsa's were really good, and the meal was fairly good but certainly overpriced for what you get.  Most the meals are around $15-bucks, which there's maybe 8 selections of them.    Going solo isn't my favorite way to go, but today I'd decided to try them out seeing they recently opened and are down the street from where I live.  I felt like a damned ghost in there, while there were quite a few people eating there -- it took a long while for the waiter to take my order, it came pretty quickly but that was the last time I came in contact with any of the staff.  I had to flag down the seater, twice, to get him to turn the fan on; it was over 96 outside and not much cooler where I was seated.  Not once was I asked how my order was, or if I needed anything - I had to flag down the waiter covering a nearby table in order to get my check.  I'd finished 10 minutes earlier, but no one seemed to notice, much less give a damn.  I can't remember the last time I left a 10% tip, but I did today, and don't feel the least bit bad because if the 'service' was any worse I'd have left a penny.  Like I said, the food was pretty good, and from what I saw others get, their dishes looked good too.  Yet for the kinds of prices they ask, all I can say is they're not worth writing home about, and I have no plans on ever going back.  There's just too many great, inexpensive Mexican places around so there's absolutely nothing that separates them from any other S'western/Mexican food establishment.  Maybe if you're with a group of friends and want to get trashed on Margaritas and blow a bunch of money on some okay food, it'd be a different story as long as you know what kind of 'hook' you're going to get put on once the tab rolls around!"}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos has been a fiery oasis to me and my sister for nearly 20 years.  A trip to visit our parents in Mesa doesn't feel complete without eating there.  Dad always gripes that we could go to the one in Mesa, but this location is the only option for me.  It is one of the few places that I can get food that is satisfyingly spicy hot.  I love the funky atmosphere, and the margaritas are HUGE.  The carne adovada chimichanga with green chile is my current favorite.  I am headed to AZ tomorrow and am taking a shuttle directly to Los Dos Molinos from the airport.  I love it.  If the other reviews about the clientele are scaring you off, go there for lunch.  And get someone else to drive."}
{"text":"First time there. Cheese crisp and Salsa were delicious. Dinner was eh! Had #1 beef taco and enchilada, well I had never had a shredded beef taco with meat mushed with rice and I don't care for rice mixed in my food that is why I said no rice. Enchilada was just ok. We were just not impressed and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Whew! Bring on the ice cream. This is the real deal.  We ventured over to this little spot after hearing that this location existed. We had been to the original one a long time ago but we were unaware of this one. The D-Backs were playing and the place was hoppin. We were seated right away and home made chips and fire-roasted salsas immediately followed.  We were greeted by the owner Drew and he served us up his own personal creation, pomegranate margaritas. Wonderful. I ordered the Victoria's chicken (named after Drew's grandma) and my dinner date had the pork carnitas. These guys don't mess around. Our food was delivered to our table in a flash which was surprising as they were slammed with two large tables. Just like I remember from my visit to the southern local, the heat level of the food is off the scale hot! But in a \"hurt me some more\" kind of way. The roasted chicken breast was ladled in wonderful red chile and was unbelievably moist. The beans were rich and spicy. I don't treat my self to the caloric content of authentic New Mexican food very often but this was true indulgence. My companion's pork was lean and tender and he kept stealing the red chile off of my plate. (Get your own next time.)  Nothing fancy here just very unique, well prepared food from a family who takes true pride in the traditions of their cuisine and hospitality, all at a very fair price. We'll be back with friends."}
{"text":"On a recent whim the best friend and I decided to venture out from our familiar Tempe surroundings and head into Phoenix for some dinner. While I had heard of the Los Dos before I have never taken the time to get here until one fateful November night.  We arrived and parked up close to the door which I thought was to indicate we would have no wait, how I was mistaken! There was no obvious signs from the outside that the seating inside was so small. We put in our name and waited on the outside patio where we had some chips and salsa to wait for our names. 45 minutes later, a bowl of chips and two frosty AZ dwellers were seated inside near the kitchen entrance. Hooray!  Noted was the décor of crazy New Mexico style. An employee took our drink and appetizer order quickly and our chips/salsa and guacamole came out quickly. Besides finding pieces of the core in our guac we were beginning to be satisfied. Another different employee came to take our food order which we were ready to provide. Things were looking up until the lights went off...  Apparently the tradition here at Los Dos is to turn the lights out for a birthday customer and bring them out a flaming Hispanic dish. The problem with this was that the lights were out for about 8 minutes before anyone produced said item. So there we sat, in the dark with no clue as to what was going on. Bells clanging, people clapping and fire spouting came the traditional celebratory food. Good we thought, we can carry on now.  Then things got ugly. Well, we got our dinners first, and then we notice a slight commotion in the corner table. What I originally thought was an older disabled man who needed help getting up after his dinner was actually a heavily intoxicated older man who had *ahem* thrown up his two margaritas and his dinner onto himself and the floor. From what my companion tells me the margaritas are particularly strong here at Los Dos and so we were present to witness this older man basically incapacitated from two Margs. Paramedics are called. Hoopla commences.  We decided to bite the bullet and finish our meal and try to make the best of things. The food it turns out is very good. Tamales, tacos and chimichangas were ordered and enjoyed. Very flavorful and well made, definitely enjoyed the green sauce here. Not too hot and not too weak, just right.  Unfortunately this brings the final flaw in our night of dining. After our dinners were brought out to us, we sat, and sat and sat some more with no employees even looking at us for nearly 35 minutes. No queries for drinks, more chips, dessert, nada. I finally went up to the register and the lady handed me my check. I asked if this was the normal practice because I had never been to the restaurant before and had sat waiting for additional help/check/anything. She nodded and apologized to then blame the craziness that had gone on. While I understood, there had been only two employees helping the elderly gentleman who tossed up his dinner and neither were the ones that had helped us thus far.   Nevertheless I paid our tab and we made our way out. Full and satisfied from food but disappointed in the experience overall. Whether Los Dos will get another shot is still undecided, perhaps another location at the least."}
{"text":"Get ready for an experience of a lifetime. Before even trying Los Dos Molinos, I knew my exposure to Mexican cuisine was missing something truly spectacular. It wasn't until I had the opportunity to try Molinos, that I knew my intuition to be correct. This location draws you in even before you order. The décor and layout is unique. Outdoor seating provides private dining in an open space. Indoor décor draws you into Mexican heritage that gets so Americanized at other restaurants.   When it comes time to order you have had your fill of the best tortilla chips and salsa your tongue could ask for. The salsa fills your mouth with multiple flavors of tomato, peppers, onion and a hint of lingering spice. The tortillas are obviously fresh, crisp and compliment the salsa perfectly.  Get ready for flavor in whatever you order. The majority of their dishes favor spice, but the waiter will give some recommendations to those with weaker stomachs. I LOVE their chimichangas with red sauce. The chicken is moist and the deep fried tortilla is flakey and delicious. Serving sizes are enough for two people, but I rarely share. Los Dos Molinos offers a typical Mexican dessert, sopapillas but I'm usually too stuffed to participate.   This has now become the only true Mexican food I will eat. I recommend it to all my friends who visit from other states, or who live here and have a hankering for something truly authentic and full of flavor."}
{"text":"The only thing I will ever remember about this place is the icy customer service and the inflexible menu. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito since I'm a substitute kind of person and on the menu is said \"absolutely NO substitutes!\" - yikes! So instead of getting $9 out of me they only got $6. But lets talk about this bean and cheese burrito...I was under the impression that a bean and cheese burrito was basically - bean and cheese wrapped up in a warm tortilla and maybe some graded cheese on top.   Well, this was not the case! Half way through my burrito I came across shredded beef pieces! I'm not a vegetarian, but if I was I would have had a heart attack! The first thing that came to my mind was \"absolutely NO substitutes!\" - but does that mean only they can substitute? Or is the cook just going senile? Either way, I didn't like that. Not one bit. I didn't really even want the bean and cheese burrito, I really wanted the taco salad, but I couldn't ask for substitutes so I was forced to pick the plainest thing on the menu and they go and add stuff to it!   I did like that they left the water pitcher with us at the table...however, the table they gave us was the smallest table in the room. We barely had room for our plates and utensils, let-alone this big water jug. I felt cramped; and this was emphasized by the guy sitting behind me, because when he scooted his chair back a little bit - it nearly knocked me face first into my plate! Oh, and by the way, large groups: they \"absolutely will NOT split checks\" so this is not the best place to go Dutch.   I will end on a positive note: ....did I mention already that they left water for us to refill our glasses? Oh...I did. Well, I guess I ran out of positives - Sorry."}
{"text":"GROSS! We will never go back to this place DISGUSTING! I have had dog food that taste better than this seriously. The service was good, but the food was horrible over salted, greasy uneatable and the prices are just as bad as the food they serve. I got the chimichanga it seriously looked like the kitchen scraped up two day old beef up off the floor and served it with the greasiest tortilla I have ever had. Nobody ate all of their food and it was a party of 7 the waiter did not even ask if everything was okay at the end. I suppose that he knew the food was just as bad as what we thought it was as well. A lot of people say the price is not bad but when you set down to look at the menu EVERYTHING was at least $11.00 the chimichanga was $14.00 to pay that much i was expecting authentic Mexican food and got NOTHING close to that. I guess you will have to experience it for yourself to see the lack of quality they serve at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food but very poor service.  It's always been like this, though, which is disappointing.  Their food is definitely worth the drive to Mesa!  I had a veggie tostada and enchilada--delicious! Love the spicy salsa!!"}
{"text":"great and HOT HOT HOT.  by pass the other locations and only head to this one.  best atmosphere and food.  change a bit over the years, a little more commerical, but still a must dine at in phoenix."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Dos Molinos.. I was disappointed to say the least.    First let me mention that the front door is on the side of the building.   Next, don't let them put you into that first table, which is incredibly tiny, especially if you're 7 months pregnant and eating with 3 men!  I'm only 5'2\" but my belly was literally up against the table.  The guys were super squished too... so I had us move as there were plenty of other tables.  In trying to get out of the little booth, I sliced my finger on the staples that hold the fabric backing onto the wood chair back... nice.  They should fix that.  And... that should be the LAST table they sit people at.    Let's move on...  Service was slow but we finally ordered.  I got the chicken chimichanga and a side of guac.  Well, I tried to get a side of guac but they brought us an appetizer of guac (which is more $$ of course).  That might have been ok since there were 4 of us but, it was terrible.  Really?  Yes... 4 hungry people and we didn't make a dent in our appetizer of guacamole.  It was somewhere in between an avocado (which I love) and guacamole (which I love) but somehow was still disappointing.  My chicken chimichanga had good flavor but there wasn't much to it.  The size was ok but it was basically just a deep-fried tortilla that was stuffed with chicken.  Meh... I'm over this place.  Maybe you have to come for the spicy food but I'm restricted on that right now because I'm preggo.  Won't see ya there!"}
{"text":"Me & my bf went here on a friday night, and were seated right away by some \"young punk kid.\" But he was nice enough to give us an extra large bowl of chips, so less \"young punk\" and more of a \"nice young man.\"   We grabbed a pitcher of Dos Equis and ordered. The server was attentive, but not the most charming or friendly. But our orders came out as...well, ordered.   I decided on the flautas. I was expecting you average, fried, crispy, tiny flautas. However, the tortillas they used were large and still semi-soft. Quite delicious. I really liked the rice too...they have a hidden taste of chicken added.   So I'm sure I will be back considering my love of Mexican foodage, the location, and reasonable price. They are close Sundays and Mondays, I believe."}
{"text":"Authentic and Delicious!  This was the first visit for everyone in my group (5) and we were all impressed with the food, drinks, service and the decor.  Food had lots of flavor - the portion sizes were generous (several of us just kept eating even though we were full because the food was just so good).  The prices are reasonable.  Several staff waited on us and everyone was great.  Heather was out waitress and when she learned it was out first time, she told us about the other locations, the history of the restaurant, etc. - built a 'relationship'.  This is not in my part of town but it's worth the drive and I'll be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Los dos for years and there was a time I would have given the New Mexico chile inspired (Los dos Molinos means the two grinders a reference to grinding Chile)  themed restaurant 6 stars if that was an option. Their self proclaimed motto \"some like it hot\" is an understatement and an anthem there is not spicier more flavorful green and red chile anywhere in the valley.  Unfortunately over the years consistency of product has suffered. Recently as many amazing meals like the one I had today as awful ones that had me swearing I would never come back. For this reason I must knock off 1 star....when it's good it's great and I would and will take the chance again and again.  The chile and margaritas are why you go here if you don't like spicy, don't go...there islots of flavor but it is also HOT. You can also order any dish \"Christmas style\" which means you want both red and green chile, only way to go IMO.   Finally get a designated driver your going to want to suck down the amazing and high octane margaritas to put that fire out and after 2 walking is hard and driving out of the question."}
{"text":"So...I consulted Yelp on my last visit to Phoenix. I wanted to eat mexican food and the majority of them pointed me here. Sean S was so kind enough to actually meet me out too, so I got to meet a Phoenix yelper in the process!!!   I prepared myself for the food to be spicy. The salsas that came out were fairly mouth burning, and I was expecting the green chile to be just as hot. It was definitely hot, but did not make up for the lack of flavor the food it was smothered in. We both ordered the blue corn chicken enchiladas. I don't know-I really expected more from this place.  I live in Denver where we have some amazing green chile and New Mexican style cuisine, so maybe my expectations were set a bit high.   All in all..just meh. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could.  I did like the thick enchilada though. And good company. Margaritas need a bit of work though...lay off the sweet and sour mix!"}
{"text":"Not sure how you can give less than 5 stars.  Great food great margaritas and cool atmosphere. Worst thing about Los Dos is making up your mind on what to order.  A sampler platter of everything on the menu.  Garlic pork platter is unbelievable."}
{"text":"Not sure how you can give less than 5 stars.  Great food great margaritas and cool atmosphere. Worst thing about Los Dos is making up your mind on what to order.  A sampler platter of everything on the menu.  Garlic pork platter is unbelievable."}
{"text":"Los Dos has been around for years and expanded across the valley.  This was my first time in this location and though I don't think it was as good as the one i grew up on (Central), it was still very good.    The motto is \"some like it hot\" and Los Dos mean it!  They use authentic New Mexico hatch chilies which have great flavor but also pack a punch you will feel the rest of the day.  Chimichangas, burritos, enchiladas, and tacos are all safe bets here.  I recommend always getting a fried egg on top of the enchiladas to help with the heat and flavor!     If you're a fan of New Mexico fare or curious to try it, Los Dos is a great choice!"}
{"text":"as a proud native northern new mexican, i have to admit, this place gives MOST santa fe and albq traditional new mexican restaurants a run for it's money.  the wait can be a bit long, but the food and service is delightfully spicy.  fun atmosphere and great food.  if you dont like spicy hot, this is not the place for you.  definitely a favorite for me and my family (who still live back home) since i moved here over 6 years ago."}
{"text":"My boy LOVES this place, and I must say it is good.   On my MmmMMmmm (yum list):  ~margaritas - tasty and strong (for me!) ~guacamole ~chicharrones ~Pork Platter (I think the pork dishes might have been a special of some sort, sooooo tender...mmmmm) ~Pork Stew  Also heard the Adovada Ribs are delicious.   Extra plus! The decor! It's absolutely colorful and crazy and bright.   Only negative I can think of is there is one guy that works here who has major attitude -- He really shouldn't be working in a people-oriented establishment if he hates them so. But then the rest of the staff were so very friendly and lovely and helpful.   Three cheers for Los Dos Molinos!   Oh, and if you like spicy, you've come to the right place. :)"}
{"text":"Do not understand the 3 star rating. Delicious food, nice amount of heat, great hand crafted margaritas. 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area.  Food is very tasty, staff are friendly and according to my wife [who is not a Mexican food lover] the Mexican food is the best she has eaten.  We have been there several times, and always find it a delightful evening."}
{"text":"Went here from a recommendation from a friend for good Mexican food with spice and great margarita's. Unfortunately we were not impressed with the customers service, the margarita or the price. The food was actually good, not great.   We were a group of 6 and when each went up to pay, the bill seemed high so after some had already paid, one person asked about the bill and was told the tip was included. I looked at my bill and the tip section was blank even though she included it and did not mention it.   I recommend trying another place before going here. Maybe another Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"Lots of buzz with this place.  Felt it was a good deal for Mexican.  In a business park/industrial part of town.  Not the same feel you may get from the other locations.  You start off with two types of salsas (Red and Green)  that are made with Hatch Chiles every other day according to the waiter.    The combinations and food was great.  Recommend:  Yes. Go Back:  Yes.  But it's pretty out of the way."}
{"text":"If you are looking to burn your face off, look no further than Los Dos!  The salsa is so insanely spicy that my eyes started to water.  Even my husband, who can handle more spice than I, was sweating like crazy from the heat.  The margaritas are strong but they are also pricey, so we usually opt for a pitcher of Mexican beer.  The beans are not a mush of refried beans.  They are full size beans with a ton of flavor.  I love their burritos.  My hubby loves the enchilada platter with the fried egg on top.  The chicken and beef in the enchiladas and tacos are juicy and full of flavor.  I wish the salsa was a tiny bit less spicy, but then I guess it wouldnt be true New Mexican food!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and great service. The hot salsa lived up to its reputation, but the chips left much to be desired. Unfortunately, the entrees were rather bland and we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Whenever I want really good (New) Mexican food, I will go to Los Dos Molinos always & forever. I love the building (old hacienda former home of actor Tom Mix), I love the kick-ass margaritas, and I think about the carnitas more often than normal. My family has been going for years and years so I my perspective on the service is skewed, i love the sassy servers I see every time I go.  But even I know, if you show up less than a half hour before closing, they will give a loud exasperated sigh, look at their watch, then up at the clock, then back and you, and then possibly seat you. Maybe.  But there is a special place in my heart & stomach for Los Dos and this is by far my favorite location. It's a fun place to go with a group because no one cares how loud or tipsy you get and it's semi-amusing to see your friends get shot down when they ask for mild sauce.. just fyi. they don't do that. They \"don't know HOW\" to make mild sauce."}
{"text":"I like this Los Dos Molinos because you still get the amazing food, without the wait. It's a more relaxed setting (although for me half the fun of going to Los Dos on Central is the ambiance) but that is somewhat reflected in the service which can be less than stellar. Still, I don't think there is a better place for Mexican food in the downtown area for sure. The carnitas are perfectly cooked & tender, the tortillas are some of the best I've had, and the salsa & sauces will make your mouth want to fall off.  All in all, a great Los Dos addition as far as convenience, and the food is just as addicting, but I would head to the Central location for the full experience."}
{"text":"I think I hyped this place up in my head but the food was rather mushy and of the whole entire menu, only two things were not spicy. You can't choose what level of spicyness to get: it's either SUPER CRAZY SPICY or not spicy at all.  I figured we trekked all the way out here to try real tex-mex in its full spicy gloriousness...but regretted it afterwards. Perhaps my palatte is just really wimpy and I can't appreciate the food but I do not feel the need to ever return again. Also, the sangria was so-so although it was a generous tall glass.  The people who own this place, however, were really super nice and the decor....well...it's one of a kind.  : )"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with coworkers (apparently it's the original?). I ordered the shrimp tacos. I'm going to be honest the shrimp did not smell that fresh and I was a little apprehensive about eating it. After eating it, definitely got the sensation it was not fresh and didn't finish it (thank god). We also had their dessert puff bread with honey. That tasted alright but was a tad too oily. I think the worst part was after the meal I didn't feel good at all. Not so much food poisoning but the food didn't sit well with me for the rest of the day. I don't think I'd return to this one, maybe I'll give the other ones a try."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time about a month ago. Hector was our bartender (husband and me = our). Order some drinks and we each got a chimichanga. Now, I am a southern bred Atlanta girl and can't handle spice but I am a curious cat when it comes to how a chimichangas can possibly be too spicy to eat. Based on reviews I was nervous.   Salsa and chips arrived promptly as did the bartender. He was so friendly and answered all our questions while giving us some background on the place. Loved that. Drinks got there fast which I needed because salsa was a bit on the spicy side. Put our orders in and ordered some cocktails. Drinks were great and generous for the price.  Food got there right on time. And....amazing! It was spicy but it was so good that I finally understood what all these food experts do when they make orgasmic sounds after a good bite. I brought half home and heard it calling my name within minutes.  My mouth is watering from writing this review.  Yes, it is spicy...but the taste is worth the extra arm lifts for water.   Bottom line... Parking was great for a Friday night Hector and service were awesome and 5 stars Salsa was too hot...maybe serve a hot and mild? Chips were awesome by themselves! Food is incredible and made me a believer.   Los dos...come to mama."}
{"text":"Great Little Gem. I have been to the original location by south mountain and figured the food would not really be the same. How wrong was I, This place has great food just like the original restaurant but with far less noise and crowds. I love Mexican food and this is my go to place in the Chandler/East Valley area. Salsa is Amaze Balls BTW"}
{"text":"So excited to share our experience with you. This was our first time going to Los Dos Molinos. This south side location took us back to old Mexico with its decor and fare. The Margaritas were off the chain awesome, we ordered the Raspberry and Mango margaritas. The flavors were spot on and they were sauced, let me tell you. We favored the red chile salsa with the chips they gave us, but you get both red and green chile and they're both ridiculously delicious to be honest. And our entrees were of the charts good, he got the Veracruz Shrimp and I got the Blue Corn Enchiladas with chicken and green chile sauce. The food service was speedy and courteous. Zero complaints, best lunch ever! The patio was packed when we arrived so we sat inside, there was plenty of seating inside, and the ambiance is fantastic!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and love it!!  The food has so much flavor and the margaritas are great and the staff is super friendly. One of our favorite places to eat!!"}
{"text":"I like heat in my Mexican food and Lis Dos Molinos did not disappoint. Besides good heat the flavor was excellent and the service was great, never wanted for anything and the table was cleared as we finished. Probably eaten here 5 times and And will enjoy coming back here many many more times"}
{"text":"We are big fans of the other location on Central and since this one is closer to us, we thought we would check it out.  Service was good, place seemed clean but the menu was a tad different than the other location.  As far as \"spicy\", I would say it was not at all.  NOTHING compares to the other location as far as spicy goes.  We ordered 2 dishes and we both felt that there was barely any spice to it.  Don't get me wrong, the food was great along with the drinks and service but I was shocked since so many people comment on how spicy everything is.  This location definitely has toned down their spice, maybe to accommodate allwhitetukee!  We will be back though."}
{"text":"If I could give this 100 stars I would!! I can't believe anyone would rate it any less. One of my favorite New Mexican style restaurants I've ever been and I've traveled the country! Spicy and so flavorful! The green chile beef may be the best dish I've ever ordered. So tender and so good. The salsa was amazing! The pasole green and red were outstanding. We couldn't choose a favorite. The service and waiters were great and helpful! The patio was perfecto"}
{"text":"Let me just say that the host and manager are super rude at this location.  They try as hard as possible to ignore everyone, act super over-worked and do their best to condescend as much as humanly possible.  Service is robotic.  It's a shame this place has the history and so-called reputation that it does.  I feel like I should move away from Phoenix, if this is the place we're supposed to be proud of.  As for the food?  Well more uninteresting typical Mexican fare.  If you haven't figured this out, I'll sum it up in two words: STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"Really, really bad. Food was disgusting, service was horrible. Out of my group of 6 only one person ate their food. Queso tasted like Cheezits... Salsa was really limey... Chicken was dried out, lettuce was soggy. Kyle didn't even ask how anything was. Just spent $100 on the worst food ever. I recommend avoiding this place!"}
{"text":"Our group was in town for a conference, and our cab driver recommended Los Dos Molinos. We loved it! Awesome patio seating in a courtyard setting, very fun vibe. The food was incredible! I had the pork chimichanga and it was the best I've ever had in my life. I love New Mexican food, especially the red chili. I want to go back again tonight!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to dine. We have enjoyed the exceptional cuisine and friendly staff of this establishment for 25 plus years. Consistently a rating an \"A\" by the State of Arizona Food Dept. It is clean, and very reasonably priced. Our out of State friends always have this as a dining spot for their visiting agenda. Their enchilada sauce is amazing! A must do!"}
{"text":"The wait is pretty long here, its a quite popular place.  Went once, had a bunch of margaritas and I think ate dinner, dont remember what it was but it was hot!"}
{"text":"We took the whole extended family for dinner between the holidays. They seated us at a large table on the patio which was fine as they have patio heaters. The service is laid back but attentive. Pitchers of margaritas flowed and everyone ordered various house specials and combination plates. Nine of us were served hot delicious truly amazing New Mexican dishes. The preparations are out of this world with a unique depth of flavor and yes it's got heat but it's appropriate for the preparations. We have always enjoyed this restaurant and have never been disappointed. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Amazing food, on the spicy side but really tasty. Authentic Mexican food for sure. Definitely not a meal under ten dollars and average price is about 13-15 dollars."}
{"text":"Exceptional Mexican food!! Our meals were delicious and it took no time for them to arrive at our table. I had the Carnita's and my husband had the shrimp Enchilada dish. Be prepared for the spicey flavors if you visit this restaurant. Overall it was delicious."}
{"text":"I adore this restaurant. We frequented this restaurant for the two years I was in grad school. It is one of the many things I miss about living in Phoenix. Any time I am working or driving through Phoenix, I make sure to stop here at this location and get my fill of hot, spicy, amazing New Mexican food! I return to Phoenix in March, for work, and you can bet that I will make a few visits to Los Dos Molinos for their awesome food!"}
{"text":"The food is always really good when we come here! Cant go wrong there. But our service was awful.. The two of us were sat right away. There was a young man that brought us out chips and water right away. The lady who turned out to be the boss came back after about a minute and got our drink order and asked if we needed a minute and we said yes. Well almost 10 minutes later she came back and got our order. We got our food pretty fast. When we got our food no one came and checked on us.. after about 25 minutes we had almost finished our meal and still no one had come and check on us. We wanted more drinks but couldnt get them because we basically had no server. The boss sat a couple tables around us but didnt stop by once to ask if everything was okay or if we needed anything. Well about 10 minutes after us finishing what we could of our food we had to ask someone else that worked there for a box and a check. At this time we had also noticed that the couple tables that were sat around us were sitting there for about 10 minutes and nobody had gone up to them to serve them. Like i said the food was great but very disappointed in what you call \"service\"."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews however today I felt differently since I was so extremely disappointed by what happened. I'm actually downloading Yelp to write this. I drove from San Diego to Casa Grande to carry on tradition of visiting Los Dos with the FAM. We thought it closed at 3 but checked the website to be sure and to our surprise said 6. We got on the road early even still to get there at 245 and saw a handwritten sign that said they closed at 3.... Super confused....when opening the door we were all smiles at the build up only to hear their disgusting greeting that they were closed. Talk about disappointed. Don't know if we will be back to feed the craving...."}
{"text":"The roasted pork special was really amazing. We also ordered a traditional combination plate with an enchilada and taco and it was delicious. I like that this restaurant offers many of the Americanized favorite Mexican dishes, however, they taste authentic with the heat and real chilis!"}
{"text":"I use to really like this place,  food is authentic even though the service usually sucks.  Tonight was especially bad, we came in at 8:30, and we stood at the register waiting to be seated for 10 minutes,  and that's not an exaggeration...not because it was super slammed but because the one waitress who was working just didn't care.  Almost every table was filthy and that should have been a sign to leave.    We literally waited 30 minutes for our meal,  and to say it was warm is being kind. My taco was soggy which meant it probably sat in the window. The waitress NEVER came back to check on us...so my meal just sat there because I'm not eating at this point cold mexican food and taking a chance of getting sick.    In conclusion,  this place is going on the NO GO list of places not to eat at anymore."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch. The staff was friendly and the service was good. They brought us chips and both green and red salsa, which is quite spicy. We devoured both salsas and the chips.  I'd forgotten how flavorful and spicy the food is. I ordered the Garlic Pork Green Chile plate (Daily Special A.) The pork was lean and tender and the green chile was perfect. I'd have preferred refries to pinto beans, but the flavor of the meat more than compensated for it. My wife ordered Shrimp Veracruz. The shrimp they served her were enormous, and perfectly cooked. New Mexico style Mexican food is far better than the local version, but you have got to love spicy food. I could not see giving this place less than 5 stars. They did everything just right."}
{"text":"This place don't even deserve one star especially for the BEEF Chile so called burritos and beef tacos is what I order, I have been to many Mexican food restaurants, Bravo's, and Carolinas on Mohave St are very good restaurant in Phoenix ... This restaurant food is not good point blank, especially the burrito and taco full of lard and grease meat look like its too smash up, no chile sauce what so ever, waste my MONEY. Will never ever go back. Dog Pound meat. Diarrhea and stomached burning...Thought in the neighborhood restaurant would be a good ideal, NOT. It's dark in there for reason. Health Department should pay a visit."}
{"text":"This is one of the better sit-down Mexican food restaurants in Mesa.  Their food is pretty spicy, but being a native Arizonan, I love spicy food. It is clearly a small family run restaurant.  They seem to have almost a cult following.  I would recommend trying it at least once."}
{"text":"The Victoria green chili chicken was good . They only give u one tortilla for the chicken. Beans good. Rice no. Spicy nacho dip has weird taste at first but it tasted ok. Food was expensive and there's no kids menu . It was good but not excellent."}
{"text":"The salsa had no taste, it was just ridiculously hot. If you enjoy sweating while you eat, maybe thumping your chest & proclaiming how tough you are, it might be just what you're looking for.   The food was bland & literally covered in thick skin of cheese that was also tasteless. Or who knows, maybe my taste buds were just shot after the salsa!   The margaritas were OK, but not good enough to make me want to go back.   The waitress was very nice & they had lively decor & music."}
{"text":"If you like it hot and spicy this is the place to start your quest.  After hearing tales about the food , I got to try it out for myself on a visit this past week.  I wasn't disappointed nor was the heat from the menu an exaggeration.  Very very tasty.  Be that as it may if you want a meek or mild meal you won't find it.  This is the kind of Mexican food for people who know the real deal and aren't afraid of it.  I loved the atmosphere, colors abound and are delightfully light and cheerful.  I went with two regulars to the place so I'm not sure if that had any effect on the service or not, but even during a busy weekday lunch hour they managed to give us our due attention.  The portion size was generous so that I we each had enough for another meal to go.  Will I be back? oh yes! you bet I will.  It gets my recommendation and a great rating for authentic Mexican food this side of the boarder.  The one and only odd thing I found, was that they don't do separate checks at a table. I have no idea why? but come on folks that's not even a real issue now is it."}
{"text":"So, after being a loyal customer of Los Dos Molinos for over 20 years at one location or another, my once favorite Mexican food joint is no more.  The food is outstanding, don't get me wrong. But the service -- from the wait staff to the busboys, to no one even being available to greet us at the door -- was so horrendous my last visit, I will not return.  By the end of the evening, I wasn't even entirely sure who our waiter was. We seemed to have been seated in a section where everyone just pitched in and did a little. A very little.  The table was cluttered with emptied and ignored glasses, plates that we were clearly done with, and the wait? We were there for 30 + minutes before anyone even took our order, and didn't have our dinner until we'd been there for almost an hour and 15 minutes. Ice water was spilled down the back of one gentleman in our party, and salsa was spilled on me, my clothes, and my handbag. Not only did we not receive a proper apology, but I was handed a wet, dirty, smelly bar rag to wipe up with. When I asked for napkins, I waited 15 minutes before I got up and went to get them myself.   I've worked in the food industry. I get it. Sometimes you get slammed. But you plan to staff accordingly on a Friday night, right? This was inexcusable.   To add insult to injury, they have predesignated tip percentages of 18%, 20% and 25%, and the waiter stands there holding the tablet while you choose his tip percentage.   Um, awkward.  If you do decide to brave it out and try this restaurant, spare yourself the bad experience and order carry out."}
{"text":"Pros: I love restaurants with lots of character. The food, drinks & service was amazing!  Cons: N/A"}
{"text":"I walked in and waited as the sign on a cut out asked, not sure where to get my take out order...  An older man with greying hair, trudged up to me glaring. No smile, no greeting, no identification as to if he even worked there. He just glared as he slowed in front of me. That's when I said I had an order for pick up. Still glaring, he pointed to the back end of the bar. He does work there as I saw him pass to the back while I paid. But Wow! Deduct two stars...   I walked towards the back end of the bar and immediately heard and felt the stickiness of the floor. Something was not cleaned up properly, perhaps the mop was used and just spread the stickiness around? I tried maneuvering around, but there was no getting around it. Deduct a star...  The young bartender? Bus boy? Smiled and greeted me, I told him I have a pick up. He said my name, verified my order and showed me my ticket/cost $17.50. I paid and signed, he wished me well. Add a star...  The chips and salsa were the highlights. They came with both a red AND green salsa! Green was my favorite, and spicy. Red was spicier but still tasty. The blue corn tamale was smothered in sauce, so was it really blue corn? Couldn't have been able to tell you under the sauce and melted cheese. The red beef burrito, enchilada style can feed two easily. I ended up pulling out the beef and eating the flour tortilla and sauce. Tamale and burrito, Egh.. Deduct a star... Chips and salsa shouldn't be the only highlight.  Will I be back? Maybe for that green salsa, perhaps a different menu item? But then again, perhaps not."}
{"text":"Los Dos is a pillar of the Mesa culinary community that began in the late '80s or early '90s. A tasty and spicy pillar to be sure. Get ready to shift into Happiness.  It's a homey Cantina style atmosphere. The staff is friendly and not above having fun with you. So smile as they come to your table, give them that knowing look, and place that large Kick Ass Margarita order. It's a winning formula EVERY... SINGLE... TIME!   The Kick Ass is the +1 Star kicker to the Los Dos Molinos experience.  A typical meal at Los Dos will run you approx $9-13 bucks. In the waning months of 2017, that's pretty darn reasonable. If you think otherwise you might want to get back on your bike and peddle to Jack in the Box. Or go back in time. But there's just no damn sense to you.  Now strap in because when the menu indicates spicy, it means that New-Mexico-slow-burn-steady-escalation type-a-spicy. Mmmmmmm. It's just perfect to me, but I do loves me some spicy food. There are non-spicy dishes available and in my experience the dishes are explosively flavorful.  The two tasty types of salsa they bring to your table will give you a foreshadowing of the spicy things to come. If you are a Mild-Sider, best to pay good attention to the menu.   The pedestrian Mexican fare, you know... tacos, tostadas, etc, ranges from fair to quite good. But, fine people, I would be horribly remiss if I did not steer you toward their House Specials. Can't go wrong with any of them. I am particularly fond of Shrimp Veracruz, Adovada Ribs, Carnitas, and the Red or Green Chili plate. Perfection each and every one.  Los Dos also has a menu section called Victoria's Specials. {In general, I'm a fan of Victoria's ANYTHING, but back to the food information.} There's some crazy tasty items on there as well. The Tamale Dinner gives you an opportunity to mix and match from their selection of awesome in-house-made tamales. My favs are the Adovada, Red Beef, and the Green Corn. Oh my! You may get so hooked that you'll head home with a dozen frozen. Did I mention the RPB? Well, the Roast Pork Burro is exceptional; I get mine Green: RPGB. Tender, tasty, just.. transporting.  3 Things I stay away from here. Tacos - The Los Dos taco shell is not to my liking. My ideal taco has seasoned, shredded beef with the corn tortilla shell fried around that tasty beef. There are just Toooooo too many other stellar items on the Los Dos menu from which to select. Not gonna settle for a subpar taco shell. Ain't happenin'.  Cheese Crisp - The cheese crisp game is far from crisp. Floppy, needs viagra.  Jalapeno Poppers - I've been making my own poppers so long that I may just be a snob. I did try one again last Wednesday night because friends from Seattle wanted to try them. Hard-pass opinion renewed. Plate appeal was lacking: they were very well done... overly done, darrrrkly over done. And the taste, well sadly, was bland.  But HEY! Forget those quibbling things. Damn near ashamed I mentioned them. Truth, whacha gonna do.   Anyway-- Go get yourself a Victoria's- or House-Special. And for the love of God, do NOT forget the Kick Ass Margarita.   You see friends and neighbors, among the other reviews is someone complaining about the wrong food coming from the kitchen to their table. That person did not get a Kick Ass Margarita. Mistakes happen, you make 'em too. Relax. Order that Kick Ass. Love your server and they will love you back.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I love this place.  My partner and I live in Minneapolis, and while there is some decent Mexican food here recently, we crave the good stuff when we are traveling closer to the border.    I think we saw Los Dos Molinos on a TV show about hot food, or something like that.  So when we were in town we drove out to the restaurant.  I can't really comment on crowds (as some reviewers have done) since we were there at a slow time of day.    Service was attentive.  We ordered beer and enjoyed the chips & (hot!) salsa.  And then we got our food.  I think I went through several beers during the meal-- bite of (HOT!) food, sip of beer.  Bite of (HOT!) food, sip of beer.  And so on.  But the (HOT!) food was so good (as was the beer) that I couldn't stop myself from finishing the whole (HOT!) meal.  I'm not always a spicy-food guy, but I loved it.  My face was sweating, the food was so spicy!  My partner was laughing at me about it; it was all good.  So, to sum up:  It was really, really tasty.  Hot and tasty.  It is absolutely like nothing in Minneapolis, and I miss it.  We will be visiting again, next time we're in town."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but the service was absolutely terrible. It took us about 15 minutes to get our drink order in and we didn't see our waiter for 30 minutes after he delivered our food. If you love spicy food, come here but be prepared for terrible service."}
{"text":"They were open for Cinco de Mayo, very understaffed! Especially for Cinco! It took FOREVER TO EVEN GET WATER. Our friends had arrived 45 minutes earlier and had just gotten their margaritas. So my husband and I ordered ours, 15 minutes passed, nothing, 20, 25, 30 minutes and counting. We finally were able to flag a server down and he was like \"oh your drinks should be waiting, they are probably at the bar waiting right now.\" We said \"no thanks, can we just get the checks please?\" Absolutely terrible service, but they were extremely understaffed."}
{"text":"Love this place for authentic New Mexico style....if you are looking for basic Los Olivos/Garcia's/Sombrero's etc. = Sonoran Style... this is not your place.  It's hot but your taste buds need to  be ready for this adventure if you can't handle this kind of heat then you can't handle the truth!  Sorry...it was the 1st thing that I thought of.    Salsa is a secret remedy during allergy season because this will clear all your sinuses. Don't stop eating the chips and salsa because once you stop you'll feel the burn set in.   Oh...do order a margarita to help with the burn....I personally love their Sangria's and found out thru the years helps with the Salsa burn - endurance! I always order anything Carne Adovada there is no other place but in Santa Fe to get this and this recipe they get it right - Salute Victoria!!!  Oh....and all thru the years of coming here I do still miss Morris~ xoxoxo"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food place on the planet.  If you are ever in Phoenix, you must go to this location.  Apparently this is the old Tom Mix house.  The famous silent western actor from our past.  The food is killer and the margaritas are very strong.  Keep in mind the food here is super hot!  When you sit down, they bring a red and a green small cup of salsa.  You think ok I can do this.....But, they also put down a pitcher of water!  The salsa is BRUTAL.  In a great way of course.  Go here, its super tasty...  Everything on the menu rules..."}
{"text":"Came here 2 weeks ago for appetizers and a Rita that was all and the tab came to $31.00. I can't imagine what a dinner would have cost, not impressed."}
{"text":"When in Phoenix on one of my many business trips there, I recently asked several people about where I could find \"the best\" Mexican food in the city.  As a native of San Diego, I was longing for some good, no-frills Mexican food like I could get back home but which is mostly Central American immitators where I currently live in the DC area  I understand the Washington St. location of Los Dos is not the original, but was convenient to downtown and we could hit it on the way to the airport.  On walking in, it looks like many Mexican places in SD.  The cuisine though, was just average.  The guacamole we ordered to start was good, but the tacos and tamales I had were just ok.  The chicken taco was really bland and kind of dry.  The beef taco was much better, but was just \"good\" not great.  The chicken tamale I ordered was supremely spicy and was also just ok.  On top of that, the server messed up my order twice and while he attempted to make up for it, how hard is it to order a couple tacos and a tamale?  Los Dos was fine, but I don't understand what everyone I asked made such a fuss about.  My search for the best Mexican in Phoenix will continue..."}
{"text":"Many years later - still my mandatory stop in PHX. Heaven on earth.  BTW - this restaurant is 10 STARS."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that we never got to eat here.  It was recommended. We arrived and the sign said sorry but \"no guacamole\". How does a Mexican restaurant run out of guacamole on a Saturday night at 630 with a grocery store next door???  We were going to overlook this but after waiting to be seated for 7 minutes while the staff was joking and took notice but nothing happened. The bartender told us that someone would be right with us but no one came to seat us. The restaurant was not busy.  This kind of plays along with other reviews."}
{"text":"Was there again and ate the stuffed sopaillas with carne adovada and my son had the special chili con carne. Everything was perfect. Thanks for making los dos our new family restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had such a positive experience yesterday (5/19/16) at lunch. We got to the restaurant right before they closed (not knowing they closed early) and the owner insisted we stay and eat, he even cooked our food himself. There was another customer there who is a regular and he talked with us and was talking to and entertaining our 4 month old son. When we got up to leave the owner informed us that the other gentleman paid for our lunch. It definitely was not expected and we were very grateful. It's one of our favorite restaurants to go to and after that experience it will be one we continue to frequent!   We will definitely be paying it forward."}
{"text":"My annual visit(s) from MN are incomplete without a visit to Los Dos. The anticipation of horking down one of their divine chimis makes me giddy, and the massive everything sopapilla is so good I'm almost ok with having to buy larger pants after inhaling one.   Almost."}
{"text":"This place has the most authentic food. Tamales and Relleno Avadoro style are so delicious.  Pinto bean versus refried beans kind of place.  Small margaritas are huge!"}
{"text":"Best food EVER. This family owned restaurant is in the home of avSilent Movie Star,Tom Mix. The place is amazing and the food can't be beat. The Chili Rellano was the best that I've had in a long time. And I've had 100's. The special, pumpkin flan will make you wanting more and wondering why you thought pumpkin pie was good. I have now been to all four Los Dos Molinos in Phoenix. I've had something different and have always been amazed. I'll eat no were else but here for Mexican Food. Simply the best."}
{"text":"Damned good adovado, pork stew, ice cold cervazas, and tasty margaritas.  The ribs are delicious!  Seriously, one of my favorite local \"chain\" restaurants (they have at least three locations in the valley).  It's good stuff.  Hate the parking lot, though."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I believe it is hard to find good quality, spicy, non-greasy, mexican/new-mexican food in Phoenix.  However, this place has passed the test.  The food truly has a kick to it, and the best part: they left out the chewy fatty meat bites, and greasy make-you-feel-sick-afterwards slime.  Have you every seem a non-greasy chimmi? If you like spice, you need to try Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"Hands down, best Mexican in town! Went there, for the 5th or 6th time, for our 1st anniversary and Los Dos never disappoints! Awesome food and ambiance, We will return again and again!"}
{"text":"First time visit for lunch. Enchilada plate was tasty. Lunch time parking. Service was a little slow but once order in it went pretty quick and the waitress was super nice. Wil be going back for a dinner."}
{"text":"Los dos Molinos is a quaint Mexican restaurant in ahwatukee. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a nice middle aged couple. The menu seemed to be very authentic and had different items that I've never seen before. This was interesting but, I am kind of a pikey eater so none of these cool items appealed to me.   The overall service was kind of bad it took about ten minutes for drinks to arrive. I only got one refill the whole night. When the food arrived it was really good it had a great flavor. I ordered blue corn enchilada's, that's something I've never had before. Everything was great. Even the bathrooms were clean, and the staff was great.  I f you are craving good authentic Mexican food, this is the place to go. If your In a rush I wouldn't recommend this place due to the bad service. But if you have time on your hands, this is defiantly a place you should stop in and check out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever. They make their salsa fresh twice a day. I always get their homemade margarita too. I highly recommend any location but I'm partial to the one on Central Ave because of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really have enjoyed the food here over the years, but I left today feeling ripped off and disappointed.  The portions have shrunken substantially while the prices have gone up. What gives?"}
{"text":"Good food, but the fare is beyond spicey!! It is Hot,Hot,Hot!!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of great things about this place but was sadly disappointed. The margaritas were not impressive and I felt like the food was all heat, no flavor.  Thankfully the service was really great!"}
{"text":"KICKASSSSS MARGARITAS!!  This is THE place to go for margaritas in the area (near downtown)!  Come grab a pitcher or 4 of the Kickass Margaritas with some friends and enjoy some delicious appetizers as well!  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2z1vI-CXPyMHEMntTszyWg&userid=F28n26ynklEioZDInyK__A)   I came here with a few clients to unwind a bit after a long day of work and it was so relaxing that didn't want to leave!  We sat in the outside seating area -- cute, but full of random decor -- I thought I walked into Guadalajara, lol  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-dos-molinos-phoenix?select=mOqppqoOhfgIncilkMVGJg#_5myU5HjdcHdwvbDArXbZg)   We ordered a couple appetizers/entree to share along with our margaritas:  (They serve complimentary chips and salsa-- I loveee the homemade salsa, especially because it is spicy! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-dos-molinos-phoenix?select=mOqppqoOhfgIncilkMVGJg#hJpJSd1U3xGYs927JX1wJg))  - Adovada Ribs: Country style pork ribs marinade in red chili, served with rice and flour tortilla.  This is SPICYYY!  If you can't handle spicy, you probably won't eat more than a couple bites of this.  I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy food and I even thought this was pretty hot.  The pork was fork tender and the homemade flour tortilla was delicious.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-dos-molinos-phoenix?select=mOqppqoOhfgIncilkMVGJg#AvtkP_Po96waiz-8dDgtUQ)  - Chorizo Pizza: This too, was VERY SPICY!  Delicious, but I was for sure sweating after a few bites!  I love how the pizza is thin, and the crust is nice and crispy!  I'd say this is more like a giant tostada with a generous amount of spicy chorizo.  I would order this again!

{"text":"This place has delicious New Mexican style Mexican food. My family has been going to \"Los Dos\" for years now, we have not tried one thing that we didn't like. All of the staff is extremely friendly. We had them cater our 130 person wedding and everyone loved it. John, the manager, has been extremely pleasant to work with. What I'll recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos por vida!"}
{"text":"Same wonderful food as the old school South Phoenix location I know and love, but the attempted recreation of the quirky atmosphere misses the mark.  We felt like the servers were a bit less attentive than at the original as well.    Bottom line:  Order something off of the \"House Specialties\" section of the menu or the Special board, specifically anything with Adovada ribs (I just tried a special of soft tacos yesterday....YUM).  If you order a run-of-the-mill taco or burrito, you're going to get a run-of-the-mill taco or burrito.  Los Dos gets extra points for serving yummy beans too....I'm not a fan of refried beans because of the weird texture; these are left whole with some sauce and have tons of flavor.  And that green salsa?  I'd drink it with every meal if I could.  Awesome, awesome!"}
{"text":"I love the food at all of Los Dos Molinos restaurants. It is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the WORLD.   I have never had a bad meal here.  Also, their food is excellent.  HOT but excellent.  Their salsa is hot and delicious and margaritas are pretty great too.  I usually stick with the enchilada plate most of the time.  Although the ribs and chili beans are excellent too if you can take the heat.  Also the place is run by the family and you can usually find one of them any given day at the restaurant eager to please."}

{"text":"This place is the Pizzeria Bianco of the Phoenician Mexican food world -- excruciatingly long waits, questionably overpriced, occasionally brusque staff. Unlike PB (which represents a wildly successful marketing coup), Los Dos is a wonderful little oasis in the armpit of South Phoenix. My SO and I have been going for an embarrassing number of years (and, accordingly, the staff is super welcoming and we rarely wait). He occasionally demands a birthday dinner there, Los Dos style -- they turn the lights off, bang pots and pans, scream their heads off, and bring a festive dessert.  Yes, the food is hot. Do you not know this when you go? I mean, you don't drive by this place on your way to the mall and think 'gee, we should try that sometime'. You are going to be in pain at both ends, my friends, but it's delicious. Even their sour cream is special, tweaked by the addition of subtle flavors of mysterious spices.  The margaritas may have grown weaker over the years, or perhaps my liver has just ramped up to keep pace. I've gotten falling down sloppy shitfaced here many a time.   The haters are just pissed off that the staff served their bratty attitudes right back to them instead of kissing their plump asses as they are so accustomed to and/or they are transferring their embarrassment about being pussies about the hot food. Tough titty. More for us!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I are from out of state and found this place for Sunday lunch. They gave us complimentary chips & salsa which the waiter warned us to take it easy coz it's chili based (which means really spicy). Im glad he did that coz I can't tolerate too much spicy food. I still ate some anyways coz it's so good. For entrees I got shrimp ajo (garlic butter sauce with rice, flour tortilla & beans) and hubby got the taco salad. We both liked it coz of the authentic taste and ingredients. Staff is very friendly & service was great. We'll definitely come back when we visit Arizona next time."}
{"text":"Spiciest food in Arizona! I have been coming here since I was young and my whole family loves it. As soon as you walk through the door, your nose starts to sniffle. I always get the burrito, doesn't matter which, all delicious."}
{"text":"Miss Cheryl puts a whole lotta LOVE in her cooking!!! Always consistent, flavorful and fresh made to order. The one place I visit when I need home. I've been eating the family's food for 30+ yrs. love ya!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in town. Spicy and authentic and delicious. Service is awesome. We go frequently and are always taken care of!"}
{"text":"Known for their spicy (hot) mexican food.  Good place for tourists wanting something different.  I had a red burro, which was good but I admittedly enjoyed the chips & red salsa and margaritas the most.   They do nickel & dime you with drinks and salsa which I assume is out of necessity.  Not the best neighborhood but safe none-the-less. I'm looking forward to going to the new location on Camelback Rd."}
{"text":"We tried to give the server a break because she was the only one for half the restaurant, but she went to people more than once, often who did not need any help, over and over and left us alone forever. We had to hail her down a couple times to get anything...I think she forgot about us honestly. But the food was good I suppose. I think it was the worst service ever, but if you don't care about that and just like good food you may like it."}
{"text":"Too expensive. The spices are bland and it's just hot, there's no variety in spice. Two entrees costed us over $30 and they weren't anything special. Meh."}
{"text":"We love this place. They have a good selection of menu items and all that we have tried were truly delicious. We are pretty picky about our Mexican food places.. but this just might be our favorite we have ever had. Drinks were mixed well, dishes were well seasoned and balanced, we even loved the amount of spice."}
{"text":"We visited this establishment on a one day stay in Phoenix based on previous Yelp reviews.  The food was pretty good but the service was very slow and unfriendly.  Upon arriving, our party of 5 was tightly squeezed between 2 other parties.  The tables should have been spread out more but we managed to fit with the backs of our chairs pressed tight against the guests behind us.  Right away we presented our server with the Yelp check in for the free cheese crisp which never came.  The server never checked back with us after bringing our food and we ran out of water, never seeing our server until she came to collect the tab.  Good food, poor service earns only 2 stars."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food.  One of the highlights of coming to Phoenix is the great Mexican food places to eat at.  Highly recommend.  Highlights - Entrees were great.  Loved the Relleno dinner.   - Complimentary green and red salsa. Red salsa was damn good.  Nice and hot. - Chorizo dip appetizer was excellent. Our waiter said it takes 6 hours to make it (cooking the chorizo I assume). - Margaritas are very good  Note, I wil admit the service was sloooooow.  I think it took 20 minutes before they took our entree order.  My colleague (local and who recommend the place) stated that you should never be in a hurry when eating here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant and it's always my highly suggested Mexican food place for out of town guests....mainly because I look forward to seeing their faces when they try the hot spicy foods.   My go-to entrees have always been the enchilada dinner or the chile relleno plate. Both come with a side of rice and beans and a homemade tortilla.   My only complaint about this place is the fact that they don't serve fried ice cream. They have sopapillas and flan, but I always need that ice cream to complete my mexican meals."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time and the service was amazing. Our waitress was extremely kind. The food was over the top delicious! And not to mention my 2 year old ate everything that was in front of him!! The atmosphere was relaxing, we sat outside and enjoyed the weather!"}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos is definitely a Chili Lovers Playground. The chips and Salsa start off your meal. The Red salsa is good and tastes rich and spicy. The Green salsa is not as spicy and my husband liked that one best. I had Red Enchiladas with eggs on top and I will definitely order that again. My husband ordered the Spicy Shrimp and the shrimp was a very large size. It was so good. The waiter treated us to Flan which is one of my husbands favorite desserts. Anyone that likes New Mexico Chile won't be disappointed with the meals. We will definitely return there on our next trip to Phoenix.."}
{"text":"reviews may not do justice with this gem. Excellent ambiance...seriously once you entre it changes your mood to better in no time. If the ambiance does not lift you then it is the food will turn in for magic. Excellent margaritas, super spicy ( made to order ) salsa and enchiladas... Some dishes will surely make you sweat!!!  Must visit!"}
{"text":"Looked forward to eating here since we moved away.  Showed up at 5:40pm.  They told us the kitchen was closed.  Window said hours were open until 6pm.  Google said hours open until 9pm.  Really annoyed at Los Dos Molinos.  If you want to close early, change your hours!"}
{"text":"Like most people said, the food here is bursting with flavor and color.  Very rich taste overall with salsa that has a kick. , very very good"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good service, potent  margaritas. The food was excellent - felt like authentic Mexican food. Definitely recommend going earlier for immediate seating! Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Mexican place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Everything is spicy in this place, they should said that in the Menu, very large portion but nothing awesome at all, Shrimp Ceviche was not fresh as the menu said, the carne asada didn't like it and not many option for kids not even crayons or lids for the cups"}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5-4 stars. We went there last night wanting very spicy food. We were seated right away. The restaurant has nice fun decor. We got our chips and salsa very quickly. The salsa was the spiciest sales we have had at a restaurant. It was vey good and flavorful.  We also ordered guac. It was so tasty. I loved every bite of it. My husband asked the waiter what the spiciest dish was and he recommended adovado enchiladas. I got red chile cheese enchiladas. I was so scared they were going to be spicy so I ordered sour cream as a chaser. I also ordered a house margarita. The baby got a side of beans for her second dinner.  The food was very good. It had nice flavor and was very tasty. It didn't live up to the spicy hype. I had no problems eating mine. I didn't even need water. It was still good but I was on a spicy mission and wanted my husband to sweat. He still enjoyed his meal and said he would go back. Maybe we went on an off spicy night? Not sure but our search continues for spicy food...  Overall good food, decent service, tasty chips (I wish they were endless though)"}
{"text":"Is it good? Couldn't really tell over the heat. I knew this going in, I like spicy and often think places under estimate how spicy they think their food is. Not here. I had enchiladas, they were spicy. Service was great, atmosphere in the restaurant is colorful. It is a great experience but probably won't make it onto the regular rotation."}
{"text":"Excellent flavors, eclectic atmosphere & good people. Tried the adovado burrito plate and sopapilla. Both were outstanding, as were the heat-packed salsas & house made chips. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Arizona. Amazing, personable staff.  When it says spicy, it means spicy, but there's tons of things you can get that aren't spicy if you're a wimp. Frozen margs are the best here.    Some people complain on Yelp because their food didn't come out in 5 minutes... but this isn't fast food people.    I highly recommend this location.  Parking is tough, but that's just the complex, nothing against the restaurant.   Food recommendation: try the Adovada Ribs paired with a frozen marg."}
{"text":"Food was good. Price point a little high. Manager with the man bun extremely unprofessional to staff while we were sitting at the bar. After ordering our meal the manager felt like that was a fine time to bleach the floor. Was our first time into that location and our last. Not sure if that was black mold growing up the wall due to heavy rains that the staff was being told to cover with metal tables to stock drink glasses. Would Not recommend!"}
{"text":"I moved here a year ago and have been to this place several times.  If I liked spicy spicy food, I'd probably give 4-5 stars.  I have only had one thing from there because it's not spicy, and that's the grande burrito.  The burrito is delicious, but everything else I've tried there has set my mouth on fire and I've had to hand it off to someone else.  For being one of the few sit down restaurants in Laveen, it's one of the better choices.  The service isn't all that great, and we never know who our server is (it's usually 4-5 different people dropping stuff off or taking orders throughout one meal) and we have to ask for things a lot, but all in all, it's a place I've been a repeat customer at"}
{"text":"This place is gross! I will never come here again! Not authentic! The food had no flavor! Whomever says this place has spicy food has never eaten chilli!! Not a fan of the New Mexican style food!   I do give them the one star for their margaritas!!! Yummy!   No bueno for the food and I've had it about three times already! Always disapointed!!!"}
{"text":"I have now been to this specific (and original) Los Dos probably 10 times, 4 of which are in the past 3 weeks.   I think they're starting to recognize my wife and I, which is cool by me.      You want spicy?  They've got it - I've had food here so spicy I was sweating within 2 minutes, but you don't need to read my review to learn that.  They've got balance too, and less spicy items clearly indicated as such on the menu.   Los Dos has been featured in numerous publications and won countless awards over the years for their New Mexican style grub as well as for their margaritas and I don't hesitate to say that both are some of the best in the valley.  Plus, if you're a movie history buff (which I admittedly am not), Tom Mix used to live here. Look him up.     Excellent spicy food?  Check Excellent house specials?  Check Excellent margaritas so damn big you can fit your whole face in the glass?  Check Awesome patio with lots of random but cool memorabelia literally everywhere?  Check Awesome staff?   Check  On my third to last visit, I had the house special Adovada Enchilada which is not your run of the mill enchilada -- it's a thick corn masa patty laid flat with all the stuff you would otherwise find inside a typical enchilada.   It was, frankly, one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten.   I also had a couple of their Sangritas (a face sized frozen marg mixed with their house sangria) which are refreshing yet deceivingly powerful.  I could have eaten more, and I could have drank more but that wouldn't have been prudent now would it ;)   On my second to last visit, I had the house special Shrimp Veracruz.  Big ol' shrimp in New Mexico red chili and served over rice with beans and a flour tortilla.  Do you like shrimp?   Try this!   SO. GOOD.  And honestly I didn't find it all that spicy which was OK.    Couple of house margs / rocks / salt to go with it.   A great marg doesn't have to be a \"premium\" marg, it just has to be made with fresh ingredients and the right amount of ta-kill-ya.  They prove that with their house marg here.    On this most recent visit (last night), I had the house special Carne Adovada Relleno with rice, beans and a few spare corn tortillas on the side, plus a couple of Negra Modelos on tap.   I recommend their Carne Adovada to anyone.  So incredibly tender and juicy.   And stuffed inside an egg batter wrapped green chile?   YES PLEASE.  It started off nice and spicy, but I got used to it pretty quickly.     Get your butts into this place, and if you do show up when you think they should be open but they aren't, give them a try some other time.  Dinner between 5pm & 7:30 is a pretty safe bet on most days."}
{"text":"My review:  Please understand that I am a hard rater.  I rarely award more than 3 stars.  My definition of 3 stars is a good, solid meal with good service.  It is a place that I recommend you try and a place I will likely return to.    The food here was tasty and the value for what you pay is within reason.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Both made for a positive dining experience.  Tonight I had the carnitas.  Yum!  Take a chance and eat here.  I think you will enjoy it.  Tell them Chris S. from Yelp sent you.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but you may get a good laugh out of it!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went on February 17, 2017. We have been coming here since it was in the A Frame. Food was good, but the service was absolutely horrendous.  Even busy, it is no excuse for someone to take your order (John). Different person to deliver it and then not one person ever comes back to your table. We would have liked to have more chips and a round of drinks. Now the table behind us that ordered that huge beer bong, server could not stay away from their table. Absolutely unacceptable, John. Girl working there is the worst ever in personality and service. John you need to hire different help."}
{"text":"I think Los Dos has the best Mexican food in the Valley, but I won't be returning to eat there after being a faithful customer since finding it in 2004.  For the third time in as many visits we waited over 20 minutes to have a waiter walk up, say HI and hand us menus.  While their chips and salsa were great as ever (thanks to the bus boy who was at least hustling), their service is becoming so abysmal to the point of entertainingly bad, that it is no longer worth the trip there if I'm going to walk out after a 20-30 minute wait for even a menu.     It pains me to say this because I really love the food."}
{"text":"To start off, this was my first visit to this establishment, and after tonight's experience, it will definitely be my last. It was not the food was tasteless, which it was, but the service was unbelievably terrible. All of the issues started with the food. I enjoy great spicy food, and from what I heard, this was supposed to be the place to find it. I ordered a Carne Adovada Burrito, which is supposed to be relatively spicy, but this burrito had absolutely no flavor or spice what so ever. It was not even close. My father and I decided to bring this to the managers attention, which leads to our second issue. Alerting the manager of the disappointment that sat in front of us, the only response we received back was an excuse. The manager tried to inform us that chiles are inconsistent, and this was an inconsistent batch. After explaining his reasons behind his sub-par food, he simply just walked away. He had no intentions to ever righting the wrong, and was okay with having unhappy customers. Other than the manager being terrible at customer service, but the general staff was also horrific to deal with. We did not receive refills on drinks until we finally had to flag someone down, and then when we couldn't stand being in the restaurant any longer, we asked for a to-go container. The person walked away as if he was going to bring us what we requested, but instead he came back to our table with a check and asked if we wanted dessert this evening. We repeated our request and finally got what we asked for so we could get out of there. We passed the manager one and final time, and we wanted to give him one more chance to redeem his restaurant's reputation that he should have been withholding. We expressed our disappointment in a civilized manner, and then he asked my father why he was angry. Excuse me? Why are we angry? We were not angry. We were not raising our tones with disgust. We just decided to explain that this dining experience was a disaster, and our return response was highly disrespectful. To summarize, I will never be returning to that restaurant, and I do not even know why they are still in business. How can people accept that kind of service? The food, also, was not even that great. If you want Mexican food and great service, please skip over this place. Do not put yourself through the agony of Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"You better like very spicy or look somewhere else! The best they have is their salsas and the handmade tortilla. I was disappointed with the tacos (taco bell style) but the other dishes are tasty and like any small Mexican family restaurant (nothing fancy in Mexico).   We go once every 2 months with my bf and he loves the chile poblano. I've tried their pork dishes and yummmmy!. After living 5 years in Mexico, this taste is pretty close...still I miss real tacos ...como del taquero :(. I never try burritos in these so called \"Mexican\" places as this is not real Mexican food for me, so don't ask me how they taste. Their tres leches cake is just good!.  BTW the outside looks like a cheap bar...is not as nice looking as the one they have downtown PHX but inside same noisy and tasty environment."}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinas has been THE dining destination of choice for cyclists headed to South Mountain. We would ride our bikes there in the morning on Sunday.... they would let us put our bikes safely inside in the back, and we would proceed to chow down on a magnificent fiery hot, carb filled, stick to your ribs meal that would fuel us for the long (and much slower) ride back.  I had my first taste of Huevos Rancheros at Los Dos Molinas..... and my first horchata.  Everything I have EVER eaten there has been wonderful.  It is truly an amazing place."}
{"text":"**** Warning danger bring a fire extinguisher!**** Can you say FREAKING HOT!  I am all for a little spice in my food but holy GEEZUS!  OK for those of you that like hot hot hot I mean burn your face off then later your BUTT! You might enjoy this plethora of torture. Me not so much! My dumb-ass sister drug me and 4 other family members that were visiting from Illinois to this fire pit of hell!  We ordered 2 pitchers of Margarita's that were more like dinking lemonade. Yuck and they were way over priced 30.00 each Kick - ass pitcher my ass.   I asked our server \"how hot is the green chili\"? His response to me was \"it's mild\". I then proceeded to order the Machaca chimichanga with green chili sauce. I love a good Machaca Chimi.   We waited for our meal sipping the lemonade AKA Margarita, munching very salty chips. Mine without salsa because one bite of that left the tip of my tongue stinging!  The food arrived it was a huge portion; I thought there is a go box in my future. I took the first bite, more dough than anything as usual with a Chimi. The second bite brought my temperature up about 10 degrees. I continued thinking I must have gotten a seed or chunk of pepper. The third bite woohoo 3 alarm fire in my mouth! After sucking back an entire glass of water and several tortilla chips. I decided it was the green Chile sauce on top and began pushing it off and away from my Chimi. I go in for the middle of the Chimi where the Machaca is and no sauce. Hells bells are you kidding me that bite was the hottest of them all like I had found the scotch bonnet surprise!!!!!!!!!   I surrender! I cannot continue with the taste bud massacre. I think I am scarred for life. At this point my lips are burning, I am sweating, and I am devouring a bowl of chips trying to put out the inferno raging inside my mouth. My poor cousins are experiencing the same type of hell. All except for my cousin Jenny who has no tolerance for heat and got the most expensive cheese crisp in Phoenix 6.95. Its cheese and a tortilla people!   I stopped the server and said there is no possible way I can eat this it is entirely too hot. Is there anything on the menu other than the cheese crisp that is not hot? He brought me the menu; I found a garlic shrimp dish and ok sounds good for 13.95 I got 5 very large shrimp covered in melted cheese. They tasted like the following recipe place 5 large shrimp in a small casserole dish sprinkle with as little garlic powder as possible, add a hand full of cheese then put in the microwave until cheese melts. It was awful gag gag gag; it had no flavor at all I could even taste cheese.   Ok I will wrap this up as I now am rambling away. I am not a spice whimp I love Wasabi and lots of it, but this kind of hot is not for the average person who likes hot. I cannot tell you if the spicy dish was good because the heat ruined it for me and my family. My sister is the only one who liked it.   I will not be back, not worth the drive, the time, the money or the recovery!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, but very spicy let your waiter know how hot you like your food, because they must assume everyone eats hot good, other than that it's really good food."}
{"text":"Both the food and service were alright. Not terrible but nothing to write home about. I'm surprised it's so highly regarded in the valley."}
{"text":"Loved it.  A simple Mexican restaurant. Great look, how I'd imagine a smaller Mexican bar/restaurant to look.  Went for happy hour. Staff was welcoming. Happy hour margaritas were on point. Simple, not strawberry, not honeydew melon or prickly pear or whatever bouchée sh*t get made up in yuppies knockoff bars. A traditional margarita, and stiff, but not overkill. I felt great after one.  I ordered the Pork Adovada Chili Relleno. Very good, not the greatest taste sensation to ever grace my taste buds, but very delicious and filling. My mother had some enchiladas and she demolished them after saying she wasn't that hungry. So they were good.  Our server answered a couple questions and he knew exactly how some of the things were made.  We went here on a recommendation, otherwise we never would've found it. And had we found likely would've passed. But my mothers friend said if you like spicy Mexican try it.  Everything we had was spicy, starting from the salsa through the meals. But not uncomfortably spicy. You knew you were getting heat in every bite but it wasn't overkill. Excellent flavor and spicy is a flavor not a crutch to lean on if your culinary skills are subpar.  They did it right. Some people have baby tongues and this may not be the place for them. Many signs  through out the restaurant decor and on the menu state, more or less, \"this is our food, take it or leave it\". The combos state no substitutions, and if a place is on point, I'm good with that. They know how they do their thing and if you found the place, just sit back and let them do it. You'll be happy.  I enjoy restaurants that put their own unique twist on tacos and enchiladas and other Mexican food, sometimes they hit, sometimes they miss. But I'll always lean toward a traditional Mexican place, especially if they pay attention to particular ingredients and preparation.  This place is right in my wheelhouse. Good staff, great food and drink, a tingly tongue and mouth after, but enjoyably so. And if you indulged in a few margaritas, you'll be floating out the door like I was, fueled up a ready to continue the adventure.  I'll be back here for sure when I'm in town. And I'll pass it on to anyone I know will appreciate it.  Thank you for a fantastic last meal and experience in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I got the chicken enchilada with fried egg on top with hatch green chile. The adobe tacos are incredible as well. Easily one of the best mexican restaurants in the country."}
{"text":"Alpo night   Horrific. Don't go...stay away. The list of issues with this restaurant are far too many to go into a whole lot of detail. A rating of 1 star is far too generous more like a -1.  A short wait - no biggie. We were seated at our table with no menus. After 10 minute of trying to flag someone down I got up and had to fetch a few myself and the hostess acted put out that she had to slightly bend over to pick up the menus.   We waited another 20 minutes (if not longer) before I flagged down the busboy to tell him we were ready to order. He agreed to fetch the waiter.  5 minutes later the waiter showed up and I kid you not he was more stoned than Bob Marley.  This guy was blitzed with greasy skin...maybe he was methed out.   This clearly was canned dog food night. I had been here years ago and the food was stellar but now I wouldn't feed this Alpo even to my dogs.   Cheese dip came, the taste was near rancid with a bit of dog flavor. It was nearly cold and lumpy.  I ordered enchiladas which were not the typical enchiladas we are accustomed to, this ok except it looked like a dog patty and the taste was spot on for cold pressed Alpo dog patty. Even my friend sat and laughed in hysteria. It was an attempt to make a corn patty, then meat, and then egg on top of it.   The corn patty was dried, very hard and inedible. The friend who laughed in hysteria to begin with was so disgusted attempting to sample my corn party all he did was spit it out. There was maybe 4 small pieces of meat and this looked like gravy train out of a can. Folks, I'm not kidding! Seriously it was gravy train out of a can.   Fried egg was cooked well, beans and rice ok.   While other tables were offered extra chips we were not and had been there twice is long. Additionally, other tables seated after us were served their food at least 10 minutes before our plates arrived.   We sat for I don't know how long before our check came so we could lay. I mean it was a long time it seemed to me. We were held hostage for nearly 2 hours from the time we walked in until we got to our car. We were a party of two and very low maintenance. As a matter of fact, before being seated we got our own an margaritas from the bar  so our server didn't even lift a finger to serve drinks.   Horrible experience! I'll never go back!"}
{"text":"When you drive 66 miles to get GREAT New Mexican food it has to worth it! Los Dos Molinos does just that and more. We have something different every time we make the trek from Buckeye to Mesa Arts Center. Tonight we had Green Chile Chicken Casserole with a fried egg on top and Two Stuffed Sopapillas with beef and chicken. Both were spicy, hot, and filled with the flavor of NM. Top that off with an order of  Sopapillas with honey and it filled a NM sized hole in our culinary hearts. Drive 66 miles if you must. It's shorter than the 475 miles back to ABQ."}
{"text":"My family loves this place, Expect it to me crowded though and the service isn't always super but the food is good and the salsa is nice and spicy. We love eating here, they are not open on Sundays though!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. Truly delicious food/drinks and super-fun atmosphere!  I went to the So. Central Phx location a couple of weeks ago after a long hike and was overjoyed to see such awesome decor and cool, ghetto-fab vibe. Tried the sangria (yum) and the frozen house margarita. Sooo huge and filling!  I had the Pork Pozole and was so damn good. Mmmm - I ordered the large size and had to take the rest home in a Dixie cup. It was so good that I got hungry again driving back to Fountain Hills so I drank the pozole from the cup en route. Sooo good!!!  Excellent service and quick turn-around of food/drink orders. Didn't disappoint me."}
{"text":"I was worried when I walked in because of the cheesy decor you might find in a chain.   This place is pretty good- I am a spicy addict.  However, with so many other great Mexican choices in the area, It may be a while before I go back."}
{"text":"I like the chili verde stew.  I have eaten here several times since the mid 90's and have tried most the items on the menu.  They make enchiladas old school style the way my grandmother made them.  The carnitas & pork plate is always good. The food is spicy so if you do not like hot spicy food beware. The wait staff is very friendly but we are a familiar face. Not the best Mexican food it is really more like New Mexican food but it is good.  Some like it hot."}
{"text":"very disappointed in this place.  I went there last night with my wife and son. we asked if they could add a scrambled egg inside my sons beef burrito. We were told no because they were too busy in the kitchen. I asked for the manager who came to the table.  I explained the situation and he says \"nope we're just not set up for that.\"  I asked why is it any different than putting egg on top of an enchilada?  He responded with \"You should know we just don't do that.\"  And walked away.......needless to say the food could have been the best on the planet but my experience was over.  BTW, the food was mediocre at best.  They make it super hot to simulate New Mexican food. I'm from New Mexico and it was nothing like the food there.  Lastly I ordered the red chili ribs.  They were not ribs.  it was just a plate full of carne adovada that had been cooked in a pot.   Unfortunately I will not be back mainly due to the managers lack of interest in being helpful."}
{"text":"This place has the best salsa in Mesa and maybe even the Phoenix area for all I know. The red sauce is nice and spicy. Get one step above the house margarita - you won't be disappointed. Very friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"It's quite easy to make something hot.  The trick is to make it flavorful and hot.  Los Dos Molinos only knows hot.  They have no idea about flavor.  End of story."}
{"text":"I'm very excited to discover that Los Dos Molinos has arrived in Ahwatukee! If you've been to their other locations, you know they're known for excellent (and spicy!) New Mexican fare. From experience though, you can find less spicy items on the menu, if that's your preference. But I recommend to try the hot stuff!  They have 4 locations in the Valley, but this is definitely a family business. The new location is open (in the Safeway Plaza on the SE corner of Chandler & 40th St.), and seems to be doing a brisk business. Since they don't yet have decent signage, and haven't been doing much advertising, it must be mostly word of mouth bringing people in.  Tonight I went to check the place out - but the wait was too long, so I will return soon for a proper visit. I'll update my review as soon as I can! It's interesting to note that Los Dos Molinos is located very near to Secreto's New Mexican restaurant. It'll be interesting to see what sort of competition ensues!  The hours are:    Monday dinner only 5 p.m. - 9 p.m.    Tuesday - Saturday 11 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. and 5 p.m. - 9 p.m.    Sunday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We took a friend that was visiting Phoenix to this location. The margaritas were really good and even the small drink was gigantic. The food on the other side was ok and pricey. I have been at the Phoenix location and both the food and the atmosphere is better there."}
{"text":"Yummo! As good as spicy food gets! I get the #1 every single time I come and its amazing! Keep up the good work Drew and fam!"}
{"text":"The food at Los Dos Molinos is why I drive an hour and a half to Phoenix.  The service could be faster, but the food is spectacular.  Be warned, their spice level is high!"}
{"text":"Finally! I've been looking for years for tamales THIS GOOD! Los Dos Amigos tamales are definitely as good as home made. Such a fun addition to our Christmas celebrations. Wish we could say more than mere thanks!"}
{"text":"The margaritas and atmosphere are wonderful but the food is average. I would definitely go back for drinks, but for food, I would visit Poncho's down the street. That restaurant has amazing salsa and it's spicier than the salsa at Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place.  Missed it while driving on Central Avenue and then when I went back and found it, I don't know how I actually missed it!  Parking is pretty convenient and there is outdoor seating (obviously seasonal).  The place is a little cramped inside, but you're there for the great food!  The salsas available with the chips are pretty hot.  Not as flavorful as some other places, but there's plenty of heat to make you want to order a margarita or sangria if you haven't already done so.  I ordered a combo while my friend got some enchiladas.  Good quality and good quantity.  Service was a little unemotional or uninterested, but it was prompt and nothing was missed.  The New Mexico style food is a good change of pace than the regular Sonoran style found at most places.  It's more of a place to go to if you're in the area rather than destination restaurant."}
{"text":"This will be our go to restaurant when we come to Arizona. We loved the atmosphere and the food. Margaritas were great. The green chili was fantastic. But they have the best beans. Really. The beans."}
{"text":"I title this \"5-stars, even though I have thrown up my dinner while still at the restaurant twice\".  It is the experience.  I think of it as Mexi-Disneyland for adults and realize that this construct is based primarily on the excessive use of seafoam green paint and the beer shack where you can get drinks while you wait for a table.  The reasons:  I've been there many more than two times, I probably had too many coronitas while I was waiting, too much of my margarita, and too much hot salsa, and I ordered the shrimp both times -- I never really eat shrimp (but how many times can a girl eat a chile relleno when the buttery garlicness looks so so good)... but those are just hypothetical reasons that may explain the throwing up.  The reasons I like it:  My bff (best food friend) is \"famous\" there.  She can call and order a particular dish 24 hours in advance and it goes on the menu as the \"Angela\" special.  I think the story goes that she was the only person to order it the first time it was offered and she loved it and Cheryl (or Sheryl... I don't know how she spells it) loved her.  I've heard the food is a little better if you go with my bff than if you go without her.... but why would I ever go without her?  She's my best food friend and she's famous there!  There aren't a lot of vegetarian options...in fact, my bff recently told me she thinks there might be beef stock in the salsa... which leads me back to the beginning and my hypotheses about why I've thrown up in their restroom twice now.  I think we're going back next week.... so I'll write with an update...."}
{"text":"I go our of my way to eat here. I live in Cave Creek and thats not close to downtown. I don't care if I have to go by myself. Whenver I am anywhere near there I head in. They have the best damn machaca chimi that could ever be made. Mmmmm, Heading there with my girlfriend tomorrow for lunch and I have been drooling for days just waiting! Not a fancy place, but amazing SPICY food!"}
{"text":"Seriously spicy Southwestern food!  Just don't ask for mild (they dont do mild!), ask instead for more water & enjoy the slow burn!  Ok, our meal wasn't just spicy, it really was tasty, too.  Highly recommend you try the chile relleno stuffed with the slow simmered carne adovada... heaven."}
{"text":"Best New Mexican food with a family vibe. They actually offer their cookbook, but I refuse to buy it because I love coming here for the ambiance and the delicious way they cook each meal. Come on by and try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Already a fan. Great marg. not screwing around with the spice. tamales are wild. The Pork was phenomenal. Ever had blue and green corn tamales. REAL food!!!!!!  The decor= lower end.The location is definitely not the best. Try it out for an adventure. But  It's all about the food."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, but be careful, it's pretty spicy!  I always leave here with a good sweat going.  The spiciness starts right away, when they deliver the red salsa as you sit down.  It is flavorful and the chips are perfect, not too salty or greasy.  I've had the tamales and enchiladas here.  Both meals left me stuffed. You can't go wrong with their red beef or chicken, both are delicious!!  Take advantage of the free cheese crisp when you check in here, it's a good starter at an unbeatable price, lol.....You can even get a mason jar of salsa to go at a pretty reasonable price!  Staff is always friendly and eager to serve you.  This place is definitely in our dining out rotation!"}
{"text":"When I used to come here years ago the salsa and food was spicy. Came here after several years and was excited about coming. Maybe because I live in Texas now with Texmex but the salsa was not even hot. I was sad."}
{"text":"I LOVE the heat. If you are a wuss, this won't be your place. :)    I've eaten there several dozen times and have never had a bad meal. The staff is NOT rude -- in fact, they recognized me every time I went over the last 6-7 years and welcomed me very warmly. They are busy, and there may be a wait, which might be interpreted as rude.   The Adovada is always fork tender and remains my favorite \"regular\" dish. If you're lucky enough to go when they have their Green Chile Stew, you're in for a real treat.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"A Wednesday night and tried attending with a party of six others. Location not open. Called the business and recorded message indicates they're open. Tried Aunt Chilada's and it wasn't bad. I won't be coming back to Los Dos since they don't keep their posted business hours."}
{"text":"Horrible service, everyone is rude and treats you like you are inconveniencing them by walking in. The food is amazing the restaurant would be great if they had better staff. Even though I love the food I will never go back"}
{"text":"I came in to Eat at Los Dos Molinos on Cinco de Mayo! I was very surprised on how busy they were and I still had AMAZING service, even though the food took awhile to come out she came back to check on us and make sure we knew we weren't forgotten about, since the kitchen was backed up. She did great and was running around everywhere and I'm pretty sure our waitress was a few months pregnant, food was great even though it took long but was okay since it was cinco de mayo. She did an amazing job at explaining the menu, When she came to ask my daughter what she'd like she made sure she got down to her level and asked her what she'd like. She's very people oriented and had great customer service! My favorite place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Los Dos Molinos is especially great for those who truly love spicy food. The food is comforting, warm, gooey, and hot. Don't go here if you can't handle heat because you will likely.... dislike it."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's very spicy and really good flavor! Their green chili reminds me of green chili back in New Mexico. I would definitely recommend this place to eat!"}
{"text":"The good, the bad, and the spicy...  The good - fun, lively atmosphere. Funny signs, Christmas lights, classic rock. I felt like I was in Rocky Point. - the host and busboy were very nice. - good salsa but HOT. I mean I like my salsa spicy (I despise the tomatoey gringoish salsas served in chain restaurants) but this stuff made me have to go to the bathroom and blow my nose twice. More on the bathrooms later... - my chili relleno plate was very good. The chili sauce was on top was delicious. I was scared it would be super hot but it was just hot enough. Beans and rice that accompanied it were just okay. - my hubby liked his shrimp dish.  - good price for a pitcher of Mexican beer. - they leave you with a pitcher of water to cool down your mouth.  The bad - our server sucked. He had a personality of a robot. He barely did any of the work either. He just took our order. The nice busboy seemed to do the rest. - this place really nickel and dimes you. They charge you for a chips and salsa refill. And they only provide one free refill of soda.  - prices are kind of high for how small the portions are. My plate had one small chili relleno and a small amount of rice and beans. My husband's plate was really tiny. Mexican food should not be this expensive! - the bathrooms had NO toilet paper in either stall. And were really dirty. - stomach issues afterwards. Maybe it was because of the spice level, I don't know. But it was an unpleasant night of sleep."}
{"text":"This was disappointing for a number of reasons, some of which may have been outside the control of Los Dos Molinos.    It was built up quite a bit from people who had been there or heard of it.  I was excited since there are not a lot of awesome restaurants that I am aware of in this area.  Maybe the other locations are better, this one was NOT up to much.  It seems like it's trying to get by on being famous for spicy food (not my thing) and kitschy atmosphere.  We tried going by for lunch and couldn't find the door.  I am still not sure if it was closed or not at noon on a Saturday, but it looked deserted.  We tried again later at dinnertime.  The inside area was PACKED.  It was like a third world airport.  A screaming baby and rude party-girl customers didn't help, but the atmosphere inside was cramped and not ok.    We ended up sitting on the patio which was fun and eclectic, but not the most comfortable.  There were benches and things instead of normal chairs and it was lit strangely.  The atmosphere outside was marred by more obnoxious kids and the guy at the table next to us noisily losing his mind over the service quality and other things.  Great entertainment!  The service quality was pretty marginal.  They seemed really short staffed, and we had to wait forever to place orders and then longer than expected for pretty much everything.  They were crowded, but that should not have been short staffed on a Saturday night!    There are warnings that the food there is SPICY and they are not messing around.  The salsa was painful, the options were between too spicy for me and biological weapons.  I ordered a bean burrito, which was not actually spicy.  I forgot what my date ordered, but it was just ok and not particularly spicy either.  As a vegetarian who is spice-averse, there weren't tons of options.  There are so many great Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, I don't see coming back here."}
{"text":"You're not missing much by not eating here.  Food is extremely greasy, service is slow and drinks are way over priced.  If, however, you are looking for uniquely spicy food, give it a shot.  I won't be going back, though."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here, despite driving past it daily for a year.  The service was good; we were seated and helped quickly. Our food also arrived very quickly.  I ordered the green chili plate and my fiancé ordered the carne adovada burrito and we split chips and guacamole.  My dish was good, though not spicy as stated. My fiancé's burrito was actually spicier, which was disappointing. I really enjoy spicy NM-style green chili.  Overall the service and food were good, but nothing we would crave again. Additionally the prices were higher than a lot of the neighborhood competition."}
{"text":"First of all. This is not  traditional Mexican fare. It is New Mexico cuisine and makes extensive use of the famous Hatch Chile that is cultivated only in the Hatch valley of New Mexico.  With that said, this restaurant has become part of my weekly dining experience (for over 15 years now). You will never find a more flavorful or rewarding \"Mexican\" meal as long as you live, I've tried throughout the country.  One word of advise, once you've tried Los Dos you will never be satisfied with another \"Mexican\" restaurant. It has ruined an entire category of dining for me. I am so disappointed with all others that I can not enjoy them. I must return to Los Dos on a weekly basis to get my fix. There was even a period of two years in which I moved out of the Phoenix area and went to the extreme of scheduling flight layovers on my business trips destine for other parts of the country in order to dine here.  I frequent the finest restaurants in the Phoenix area and place Los Dos in the top ten of this city's best.  The wait can be extensive, especial on the weekends and the serve is often lacking to one degree or another, but it simply adds to the atmosphere and the overall experience within the walls of Tom Mix's old homestead (those of more advanced years may appreciate this knowledge).  Enjoy!  Oh Yeah! You better love it HOT!"}
{"text":"You could say I have a Los Dos addiction seeing as I come to this location almost every week to order the carne adovada chimichanga Christmas style with a side of rice and beans. And although the food is the main reason for my frequent visits, another key to me coming back is the warm welcome I always receive from the staff especially Cesar who always goes out of his way to make each visit fun and inviting.    Between their delicious food, incredible service, and great atmosphere, Los Dos is a must visit restaurant in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The food was just ok and did not sit well.   The margarita was perfection. Large and boozy."}
{"text":"I am not going to say this is the fanciest nor best Mexican food I have ever had, but it is up in the top 20%. There hours are a little weird; and the place fills up fast. I am a spicy type of soul; so this is really the place for me. If you are going to go with a pitcher of Margarita's; I recommend upgrading a bit. The prices are reasonable, but the charges for extra salsa kind of irked me a bit. The crew there is a little slow paced, as I noticed many people had the same feeling we did. The location is a little out of the loop, but after a Dbacks or Sun's game, it is well worth the extra ten minute drive south!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this restaurant has 3 stars, but this is Yelp!  The home of the 10 cent millionaires lacking 2 nickels to rub together and need a way to bitch about their awful life.  As a passport holder, I've ate many different dinners from many countries.  Mexico doesn't have a place this good and the only place that could compare was in Gold Coast Australia.   I read a complaint about the food being too hot.  It doesn't take a passport to go to Mexico. The spice is mild compared to Mexico so get a life."}
{"text":"came here last weekend and sat on the patio.  ordered the chimichanga with shredded beef and was pretty good. chips and salsa, both the red and green are very good also but the waiters attitude ruined the dinner."}
{"text":"I had never been to the location off of Central and it had been years since I've eaten at the Mesa location.  The red salsa is mighty tasty/spicy and it's almost worth the trip for it alone.  My friend and I ate three servings.  For lunch I enjoyed the carne adovada and the beans/rice which I normally don't even eat at other Mexican restaurants.  The atmosphere is very comfortable and goes with the long history of the building. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"If you enjoy Salt and Lousy Service then this is the spot for you.  Honestly, I'm not sure why people are so hype about this place.  Yes the Salsa is spicy but really has no taste to it.  it's like Spicy water.  Everybody in our party of 7 did not even eat a quarter of their meal.  The Machaca that i had must have been Marinated, Aged and Cooked in Salt using a Rock Salt Oven and to make matters worse the servers were no where to be found to refill our refreshments as our mouth dried like Cured Hides.  This place should have been called Los \"Sal\" Molinos and should have stayed a Funeral Home and use the large amount of Salt they use for Embalmment.  Currently competing with Morton for the #1 spot as Salt distributor in the South West Region."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Los Dos!!! A lot. A lot. A lot!!!   If I have a friend in from out of town and they want a good representation of Mexican food and atmosphere here, this is where we head to. The building is just beautiful, and when you walk in to see the patio area, I don't know anyone that could not fall in love with it's complete randomness that somehow matches perfectly. The statue of liberty, the fountain, the old bicycle.. it's briliant!!  The food is also incredible. I crave the salsa constantly and the sopapillas are a force to be reckoned with. So far I've had the carnitas and the adovada and love it. I like that Los Dos isn't afraid of spice and doesn't wimp out for it's customers. It's authentic Mexican, take it or leave it.  I've had a good time here both with small and large groups though with a large group our orders got all confused as it was hard to hear the orders the server was shouting and they were just set down anywhere. However, it will not stop me from a return."}
{"text":"I am a super busy person, so it's been difficult for me to find an opportunity to go to this place. I was curious ever since I heard that they specialize in really spicy food.  Los Dos Molinos did't fail to please. The outside looks a little generic, so when I walked in I was almost surprised to see such a beautiful and hip, yet traditional cantina style atmosphere with modern (electronica) music playing. The staff was friendly and down to earth.   The complimentary chips and salsas (one red, one green tomatillo) were very tasty. The green salsa was pretty serious...definitely hotter than the hottest salsa you get at the Taco Guild, but still flavorful and enjoyable. I am very happy that I finally found a place where I do not have to beg to get something that I consider spicy-hot.  I ordered a house margarita, blue corn tamale, and a side of rice and beans. I was amazed by the unique, smoky flavor of the tamale. The rice (yellow) and beans were very saucy, topped with a touch of melted shredded cheese, and delicious. I like that Los Dos is hip, but not above serving rice and beans. Best of all, the tamale had a spicy kick on its own.   Everything was delicious and what i considered to be spicy done right. People looking to have tears stream out of their eyes might be disappointed...but people who sneeze after just looking at a bottle of Frank's Red Hot would't be able to handle most of the dishes there (there is a little pepper icon next to the spicy stuff to help those with tender tongues find something palatable). I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"I know that a ton of people like this place but I've never been impressed.  The spice level is too much to be enjoyable so I tried something that wasn't listed as spicy.  I had the chicken taco salad and the chicken was good but there was no real flavor to the dish.  The Camelback location (where I ate today) did have really good service which is completely different than the experience that I had at the Ahwatukee location awhile back.  So many better options for Mexican food in this area."}
{"text":"This was my second time at a Los Dos Molinos, first time at this location.  The first, at the south phoenix location, definitely has a lot more character on the outside and in.  This one just looks like your average strip-mall restaurant/bar.  It's not a particularly inviting part of Mesa, in my opinion, but I was in the mood for something spicy and I had just read the Best of Phoenix 2009 review on the Adovada Ribs and I had to go try it.  So it was just my wife and I with our little girl.  We entered at the south doorway, not really sure what to expect.  The front of the building is all mirrored glass windows with neon signs.  There was a bar and a bigger banquet room behind that, but no one there.  But off to the right, there was a doorway with light and more noise so we cautiously made our way over.  There were about a dozen folks there, at various points in their meal, and that nice homey smell of good food.  We got seated over by the north side, where there was another entrance that we didn't see.  It was kind of a dark corner, but it was okay.  There were a few other folks on this side two, and a big old expresso machine sitting on the other side.  Not sure if that gets used, because it looks more like a decoration.  Anyway, my wife doesn't like real spicy food so she got the bean and cheese burro, but I ordered the Adovada Ribs.  We enjoyed the tortilla chips along with the spicy red and green salsas.  That alone is worth coming out to Los Dos Molinos for.  It has a good burn, but wow, so much flavor and a good garlicky kick.  It took a little while for them to come take our order, but the food came quickly.  There were folks around us having some large, very pretty margaritas, but we weren't drinking.  I'd probably get one next time.  The food was very good.  Served hot and wow, lots of spice!   It's good that they serve pitchers of water along with their food!  It's not just flaming heat, but a very nice complex blend of spice and flavor and heat, definitely not the average \"mexican\" flavors.  The beans are not the mushed up refried type, but they're stewed and perfectly seasoned and cooked.  My wife's bean and cheese had these beans in it too and it was not just the mush.  I got so full, so quickly, because I was gulping down so much water with every bite!  But it was really really good food and it's definitely somewhere I'd want to bring my friends from out of town.  I docked a star for the location/ambiance and another star for the charging a $1 for extra chips and another $1 for extra salsa.  Not that the salsa isn't worth it, but I just think it should be part of the service at a place like this.  It definitely encourages people to buy more drinks!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Started going in the early 1990's.  A requirement of where I live is to be within a 5 mile radius of a Los Dos Molinos!  I love the spicy food and have never found a place to match it.  The green chile is my favorite.  The owners and staff are very nice and attentive.  I usually eat here 2-3 times per month, it is that good!"}
{"text":"I think that I shall ever see, Mexican restaurant wanna-bes. Restaurants whose salsa leaves me flat Whose margaritas  are not all that  Whose chimichangas are half fried And n'ere a fresh avacodo eyed And just because we are in the States Should not warrent Mexican second rate  Oh that mediocrity could be removed Phoenicians could be Mexican proved Spicy, saucy, hot and  with much con queso The difference would be Los Dos Molinos  The difference here is not cosmetic The difference here will turn the skeptic If the tomales here were put to test You'd find them more than worth your quest  But bring the burrito to the table now To really get the sense of their real \"wow\"...  Much more than this I cannot say Eat, sing, dance and saute'."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Mexican/Southwestern food anywhere!!   Notoriously hot - so non-natives beware!!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Excellent service!  The place is small and busy during the lunch hour, but the service is quick.  I had the chicken chimichanga, which was great.  Love the sour cream too!  The two salsas were both spicy, but good.  I had the sopapillas for dessert with honey and powdered sugar, which were also good."}
{"text":"Can't believe the good hype this place gets.  Very disappointed. Had heard such good reviews everywhere.  The margaritas, too pricey - served in plastic glasses - were weak and a few steps below lime aid - we waited in the patio - had to get our own drinks and no chips/salsa while we waited for our table -  food was decent but nothing to rave about, really lame to have to pay extras for additional chips and salsa and the forks were ,even though not plastic, like something out of a camping or picnic kit - won't go back - too many other really good Mexican places in the valley.\""}
{"text":"Great little spot for lunch. Food is excellent and authentic. It's a little spicy off the menu, but the do have some gringo light options.  I take clients to lunch here often and haven't been disappointed. Only negative is the parking, but that's not terrible."}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego and it was impossible to find a place with authentic micheladas or margs with only fresh lime juice. I'm so happy a friend referred this place. Such good margs and micheladas would highly recommend. Also Chris was an amazing bartender, he was super attentive, he asked if I wanted a water which is always a plus with drinking and I mentioned I liked Tajin with my micheladas, when I switched to margs he asked if I wanted tajin instead of salt before I could even ask."}
{"text":"I wanted to LOVE this place.  But I can't when their food is bland with no flavor.  I don't consider spicy/hot salsa to be a flavor.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the Delicious House Margarita and the bartender who took my drink order.  I ordered a Medium Margarita.  Flavor was great.  Not too sour not too sweet.  Had the right amount of tequila for my taste.    The waitress took our order and that's the last we saw of her.  She didn't deliver the food, she didn't check on us, she didn't offer refills on our water.  Yes their salsa is HOT but you can't taste anything else.  The green salsa had a little bit of flavor so I stuck with eating that with my chips.  I ordered the Garlic Shrimp dish.  I expected to be overwhelmed with Garlic Flavor.  Not my first time ordering a garlic shrimp dish at a Mexican food restaurant.  The Shrimp looked boiled, the garlic sauce (water really) was so watered down and I couldn't taste any garlic.  It soaked into my rice (which might have been tasty had it not had so much garlic water on it).  The beans were dry and needed to have salt added.  The homemade flour tortilla that comes with the meal is so thick and dry it was like eating paper.  I've had plenty of homemade tortillas and this is definitely the worst I've had.  I ended up adding some of the green salsa to my dish just to give it some kind of flavor.  So sad that my first experience here was so disappointing.  If someone else is paying I may go again but I won't waste my own money unless I'm just going for drinks."}
{"text":"To all those who say that los dos is not authentic mexican food, you are right.  It's new mexican food loud and proud putos.  Get delicious, spicy, enchiladas, machaca, chile rellenos and carne adovada served new mexican style.  The service here is somewhat sketch at times, but the margaritas are tasty and the salsas are delish and put a fire on your tongue that necessitates mas margarita which equals mas divertido.  My favorite thing that they serve, carne adovada tacos, is actually not on the menu at this location (i usually go to the downtown location), but the enchiladas, carne adovada, and salsas are legitima."}
{"text":"Unappealing big pieces of pulled chicken on my tasteless chicken taco salad. Not enough lettuce or tomato either.  Long trek to the restaurant. No plans to return."}
{"text":"From the way people were talking I expected to not even be able to finish due to the spice but I found it to be perfectly hot.   Maybe its all the years of eating spicy Thai food, or maybe its just that people in Phoenix don't eat spicy food.  Shredded beef was seasoned perfectly and the green chili was the best I've had since I lived in Colorado.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place has great food margaritas and service I love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the overhype about the spice intimidate you. Yes it is spicy but it's not gonna kill you. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times! The food is awesome, pretty spicy (I love to feel my mouth burn though!). I love the ribs (no bone, just meat).  Highly recommend if you like spicy food, otherwise you will not enjoy it.   NM is the best!"}
{"text":"I've lived in AZ for, around five years, and I have seriously avoided eating here after reading yelp reviews for two reasons:  A). people's comments about the level of spiciness.  Look. I have taken a bite out of a raw habanero and said, \"eh.\" I can handle it. But I've always been afraid to bring anyone I'd want to dine with here for fear they wouldn't be able to eat the food.  B). The comments about the service.  So much whining about the service.  Let me tell you. Everyone who says the food is SOOO SPICY--you are why I cannot have nice things! The food is this really lovely level of burn. I could eat hotter but my husband can handle it here as well, and really enjoys it, so no, it's not too spicy. Order the flautas if you're someone who can't handle a packet of mild sauce at a Taco Bell. There are non-spicy things on the menu. Do not ruin spicy food for the picante lovers out there. Stop ruining all of the spicy food. You are why wing places tone down their suicide wings. Because you order suicide wings and expect them to be ketchup. Stop it. Just stop this now.  The service. Yeah, it's not Applebees. No ten minutes or it's free. It's a small restaurant. Whatever. Every time I've gone the food has come out quickly and the water has been replaced quickly, but man it's so good I really have no problem waiting for it while I suck on a margarita. Also, the margaritas are the bomb diggety. I always get the prickly pear margarita and it is strong and delicious.   The carne avodava burro special is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I trade off on this and the green chile stew. Just totally friggin' fabulous.   I love Los Dos Molinos and I finally feel like living in AZ isn't horrible anymore. I cannot believe I feared coming here in the past, and I've been eating here like once a week to make up for lost time. I know it's New Mexican cuisine and not technically Mexican, but it satisfied the gaping hole in my heart for delicious Mexican food of the variety I enjoyed while living in So Cal.   Sooo yeah. Los Dos Molinos. I dig it."}
{"text":"Try the Advovada meat! It's totally amazing!!  Warning SPICY!! Don't write a poor review about this place cause you can't take the spice. The food is amazing and it keeps me coming back. I've only sat at the bar and the service has been great. The atmosphere is wonderful and place has a good happy hour."}
{"text":"Came here today for a business lunch. It was more New Mexico style Mexican food versus Sonoran, but I really liked the flavors. They bring out two salsas; one red and one green. I tend to prefer the reds, but the green wasn't a tomatillo salsa, instead it was more of a green chili salsa (delicious and spicy).  I ordered the number 2 combo, which came with a beef taco and a red chili tamale. The flavors of the meats were excellent and the red sauce they used on the tamale was perfect.  The service was very slow, as it seemed there was only one server doing most of the work.   The prices were reasonable, most being in the $10-15 range."}
{"text":"Had to go back to the kitchen to get my own silverware. Pretty sure my server was drunk or high. Asked to pay my bill and was told \"it will be a while \". The food was also not as good as it usually is. Something was off. Unfortunate because I brought someone for the first time and was raving about it. Unsure we will ever come back."}
{"text":"I hope you like spicy food.  We do, so Los Dos is right up our alley and less than a mile from home.  We went with coworkers from work and despite our group being 10 people our food and drinks were still prompt and delicious.   I ordered the machaca chimi and it was extra spicy, so much so she had to warn me.  When a place that serves spicy food has to warn you, you know it's going to be hot.  Thankfully I had my margarita to cool me down.  I ordered a medium which was a two-hander and yummy.  Since I had two (the second I added prickly pear flavoring which took it up to an 11) I was sufficiently drunk and very glad I was not returning to work.  Not our first trip and definitely won't be our last."}
{"text":"Customer service was really good. Each employee was friendly to us.  They made us feel welcome.  The restaurant itself is nothing fancy. Has some gaudy decor but it makes you feel like the food is going to be good.  :). Sometime the best places are the little hole in a walls.   The first bowls of chips and salsa are free but the second are $1 each. The red and green salsa taste good and are spicy. Taste home made to me. I don't typically like green salsa but I liked this one.  The cheese crisp was not crispy.  I would suggest telling them you want it crispy so that they will cook it longer.  What I noticed is the spicy dishes taste good but the other items like tacos, tostada, rice, beans are bland.  Sister ordered combo #3 taco, tostada rice and beans. The meat in the taco was bland and mushy. Had a weird flavor.  The rice tasted packaged. The whole beans had no seasoning.  I ordered Adovada Rib dinner. This was cooked well. Lots of flavor and spice. I got the same packaged tasting rice. My beans were in a red sauce that tasted like it was canned. The tortilla was very dry and hard.   Daughter ordered a beef and bean tostada. When she picked it up for a bite, she only had half a shell. We looked underneath the mound of beans and lettuce but the other half of the shell was missing!  I really wanted to like this place. Living in Mesa you'd think there would be better Mexican restaurants to choose from. This one is marked off my list."}
{"text":"The food is unreal! The best Mexican food ever with authentic red and green sauce  The owner John is always pleasant. Ask for his recommendation if spicey is not your thing! They are known for spicey flavor. The cheese crisp with chorizo is to die for. Don't come close to lunch closing time unless you want to meet the cranky lady waitress! Guess she had an appointment right after lunch closing.  Sad to witness her attitide to solo dinner who came at 2:30."}
{"text":"So, I moved out here to the Valley from Illinois in 1989, taking a job in Mesa. Often for lunch, we would go down Main St. to Los Dos Molinos, where Victoria and her family had moved down from Springerville to pump out amazing food in an old Der Weinerschnitzel. I watched as the family got so busy that they opened the Alma School location and later the Phoenix South Central location. The sign out front of this Camelback/Uptown location says \"New Mexican\" cooking. So let's correct this upfront. It's not the New Mexican cooking style of Santa Fe and Albuquerque; Los Dos Molinos is and has always been a unique style specific to the border of Arizona and New Mexico. Today is the first time that I visited the Camelback/Uptown location. My impression is this...the care of the family's cooking is still there, but the heat has been toned down from the family's earliest days in Mesa and Phoenix. That's not necessarily a bad thing. I recall my first visit to the South Central location not long after they opened. I remember the intense chile heat starting with the salsa and chips all the way through every taste of the meal. We're talking tongue-numbing, eye-watering chile heat (that's not a complaint, I like heat.) Today at the Uptown location, the heat was suggested but not overwhelming. Stepping inside, this location has immediate character and warmth. We sit at the bar and immediately get friendly service. Chips and both salsa verde and salsa roja arrive quickly. Both salsas have a fresh bite to them and are delicious. I order the adovada enchilada \"Christmas\" and my other half orders the chimichanga, shredded beef, both with beans and rice. The adovada was large pieces of well-cooked pork, the shredded beef was tender and flavorful. We finished every bite and agreed that we would be back. For environment, service and satisfaction when one has a hunger for Arizona-Mexican cuisine, this will be high on the list."}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos doesn't know how to do mild. But if you like it hot, woweee this is your place!   Service is slightly spotty; however, I always have a great time when going here.   They make one mean margarita here. Had a blast with Missy F. with Dude as our DD once!   Love their green and red salsa. Just a tip, the first bowl of chips is complimentary. After that, you get charged.   Of the three times I've been here, only have tried the green and red chile platter with beef, and my favorite: the Machaca burrito.   Worth paying extra for sour cream as this is melt your face off status . . . Right, Miss?! And it's big enough to share.   It's been a long time since my last visit, and will have to drop into LDM for either dinner or drinks soon when I'm in the Tuke.   Recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious New Mexican cuisine! They don't do mild.   The staff is friendly and will keep you glass full, but beware that it's not the quickest service. This is definately a place to go and unwind and take your time eating.  Food- I've never had anything I didn't like here. The adovada ribs are great and ridiculously hot. But my personal fav, is the spicy guacamole, made fresh and guaranteed to make you sweat. The red chili burro enchilada style another hit out of the ballpark. They used to have a great green chili stew, but sadly it's was a limited time menu item."}
{"text":"Classic Mexican food restaurant. Chips + Salsa, Sugary Margaritas and greasy shredded meat tacos with lots of melted cheese with mexican rice and beans. Really good but nothing special or unique."}
{"text":"Ay ay ay ay!  This place has so many crazy rules!  Two are listed below...  1. can't usually accommodate big parties unless the party has 25 people or more and then the banquet room can be used.  For a party of 18, this was a bit frustrating but we were there for a birthday party and wasn't going to stress about it.  2.  When you order a pitcher of margarita, you can only have four glasses.  So for six, you have to order two pitchers! not a bad rule, I guess, but is there a need for this rule at all?  I was forewarned that the food is especially spicy.  I can attest with minor burns on my tongue from the salsa as evidence.  I am sensitive to spicy food but was really intent on trying the house specialty, adovada, which is as spicy as the salsa.  I ordered chimichanga with beef adovada a la carte, since I was full from chips and spicy salsa and two pitchers of margarita!  I also asked for a side salad but they don't serve side salad, so the server offered to add extra lettuce garnish on the plate.  My chimichanga was plated on a platter with tons of shredded iceberg lettuce surrounding it.  WOW for the lettuce garnish.  Was it prescience, common sense, or clairvoyance that made me order a pile of lettuce with my meal?  Whatever the impetus for this action, it was a smart move as the adovada was on the salty side, packed with spicy heat!  If you take the salt away, it would just be spicy.  If you take the spice away, it would just be salty.  Chili peppers do have a flavor to them, and I like it when that tartness, or bitter-sour flavor comes through, and the spice envelopes it in texture.  The spiciness was so poignant that it numbed my tongue a bit, unable to taste, and which could explain why it was salted the way it was.  The additional sides of the lettuce, sour cream, and guacamole really rounded out the chimi, and I ended up enjoying my meal.  the third pitcher of margarita could have helped reach the level of enjoyment.  Los Dos Molinos seems to be a favorite place but for reasons of which I am not certain.  I liked my meal, but was not spectacular, the prices were not so good that I would come back for cheap eats, the location was too far to add to my rotation...  My rec, is to go with three other people, (four total) who like the adrenaline rush of super spicy salsa."}
{"text":"Just okay. Very fast service but a bit bland for my preference. The chips and salsa both had a charge for re-fills but the entree prices were reasonable for the cleanliness and ambiance."}
{"text":"We heard a lot about this place and were excited to try it but once we were there we couldn't wait to leave. I don't like very spicy food and everything on the menu had a chili pepper next to the name. There were maybe two items without the chili pepper. We ordered anyway because my boyfriend loves spicy food and we were already seated. My blue corn? tamale was inedible, my rice was a mix of newly cooked and old, dry, hard rice as is they scraped it off an old pan and mixed it in with the new. The carne adovada was nondescript. We left most of our food on our plates and still left with heartburn from the overbearing spice."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place as I've struggled to find a single decent Mexican restaurant in this area. I'll have to come back to give a fair shake via a burro. But the food my wife and I had today was awful. Their salsas are sub par. They taste artificial. But the chicken taco and shredded pork taco was atrocious. Two greasy yellow corn soft tacos with small bits of unseasoned boiled meat, way too much lettuce, some cheese and a couple tomato wedges. My wife described here tostada as several layers of tasteless ingredients. Like I said, I won't judge it until I've tried a burro, since this is a norteño style place. But if you can't handle a decent taco and you're a Mexican joint, you got issues. Although we hate Taco Bell, we both agreed that a bean burrito from Taco Bell would have been better. Isn't there one good Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa area?? Maybe I need to only find those divey taquerias in Mexican neighborhoods. But so far Dos Molinos is thumbs down. C'mon guys, do better."}
{"text":"Man oh man, thems some good enchiladas!!   I made my way over to Los Dos today at my new homeboy \"Mihio M.s\" suggestion. I've been craving some New Mexican food lately, and thought this was as good a place to start as any.   I had the 2 enchilada dinner plate with the fried egg and beans and rice. The fried egg put these bad boys over the top. Somewhat annoying however that I had to get the whole dinner plate as the \"a la carte\" enchiladas do not come with the egg on top.   The enchiladas were awesome. Thick, massa based enchilada with a great spice to them. While many here seem to think the food is especially spicy, I didn't think it was that bad. More the \"runny nose 30 seconds later\" type spicy versus the \"holy hell my tongue is on fire\" spicy. Very, very good.   The rice and beans were pretty run of the mill, but when combined with the wet egg and enchilada made for a pretty dang tasty bite.   The lemonade, while decent, seemed too sweet and I questioned whether it was home made. Although my server assured me it was, it had that \"Minute Maid\" sort of taste to it. Just too sweet I guess.   Extremely delicious table salsas and obviously home made chips. I even started adding the hot salsa to my enchiladas for an extra kick.  Awesome stuff.  All in all, a very tasty meal. A really great atmosphere as well. At 18 bucks with drink and tip it was a bit on the pricey side, but I will definitely be going back here again."}
{"text":"Some like it hot and I am one of them. This is my favorite Mexican place in AZ. Everything I ever had here over the past 20 years has been excellent.  The Chorizo Dip and the Carnitas are my favorites. All the Shrimp dishes are outstanding."}
{"text":"Food is good, but not what I remember it. Beans tasted like maybe from can but other then that the rest of the food was flavorfull. Had the shredded beef chimi with red sauce. Let me tell you the spice ain't no joke. Had my nose running for its life. If you check in you get a free cheese crisp which was good for being free. The staff is great seems like they work as a team and everyone will ask if your good was good or if things are ok."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the many wonderful authentic \"New Mexico\" style dives that I have had so many times traveling through Albuquerque throughout the years. For those from New Mexico, Perea's is the first place that comes to mind. I had the Carne Adovada Tamales with red sauce. All of the flavors were simply awesome. Just enough heat for my tastes yet  not too spicy to overwhelm the actual great flavors of the dish. I recommend ordering a side of Sopapillas with honey on the side to eat with your dish. Making the perfect pairing of sweet and salty. Only thing I would say keeping this review from a perfect \"5 star\" is their salsa. I felt that it left a little to be desired. Their actual entrees were just so damn good, the salsa just did not reach the same level of greatness in my opinion.  Beyond that Los Dos Molinos is one of my new local favorites."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant we have eaten at in the Phoenix metro area. They offer spicy food that is excellent. A must place to eat if you are in the Phoenix area. There are 4 restaurants."}
{"text":"No. Just no. Never again. First of all. We waited 13 minutes just to ORDER our drinks. Then we waited an additional 30 minutes to order our food and keep in mind. Another party came by and they ordered drinks and food right away once they sat down AND got their food way before we did. I understand that in the menu, it states that there will be a little wait since it's just the cook and an assistant but damn, we waited over an hour to just get our food. And they got better service once they sat down than we did. I ordered the carnitas and my mom and Brother got the chimichanga. Let me tell you about my carnitas. Or should I say, Manteca (fat). Where's the meat? It was hiding. I literally had to dig inside the fat and cheese  to find it! The beans, were ok. Just boiled regular pinto beans with no salt and added cheese. The rice was actually ok but I was so disgusted to eat anything. My brother and mom liked the chimichanga but skipped the rice and beans. In the meantime that I was trying to find my carnitas in the Manteca, no one. But I mean NO ONE checked on us to see if we needed anything else or to see how the food was. The waiter didn't even ask if my food was ok since I left the whole plate when we asked for the check. He just bypassed it like it was normal. What a disappointment. I'm sorry but I will NEVER return and will not recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Pretty average non-authentic Mexican food. 5 stars because the food is good and the staff is always friendly. Nothing negative to say, just not my mama's cooking but not bad either. :) very filling so come with an appetite!"}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos is a must try! It has a neighborhood restaurant vibe with very friendly people working there and efficient service. They serve the most flavorful Mexican food I've ever had and I was blown away by the quality of ingredients put into each of their dishes. Their chimichanga was delicious and was plenty of food for two people to split."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and LOVED LOVED LOVED it! Not sure of these negative reviews. They appear to be some haters. The vegetarian commenter guy, well come on dude. You and your boyfriend should call ahead and ask for veggie options. My daughter is veggie and I always do that. Anyhow, the chips with the 2 salsas were dynamite! Wow authentic spices and great flavor. $4 Negro Modelo cam out ice cold. I had the carnitas and they were fantastic! Huge portion too. i cook this often so I appreciated there version. My wife, who is from New Mexico and appreciates NM cuisine had the chicken chimi and said it was very good and PACKED with a ton of meat. Portions hear are huge with the meat! Yea meat! My wife ordered sopapillas with meal as all New Mexicans do and they are great. Only issue I felt the beans needed salt but they were cooked perfectly.   Service was great. Laid back server was cool and very helpful - nice guy. The owners husband (Boyfriend?) was an exceptionally nice guy. Came to our table to explain the menu for over 5 minutes. I love when the service is menu guided to help dwell down to what you like. Thanks for that.   We live rather far from here which stinks but will make a trip out again for that tasty food."}
{"text":"Could go to five stars after I try the adovada, chili colorado, sopapillas, etc.   I had the stacked enchiladas, which weren't stacked, there seemed to be two stuck together. But the egg was perfect. So maybe its a regional variation.  This is New Mexican cooking. It has it's own specific history that starts before the Mayflower landed. Comparing it to food from Mexico would be like comparing Italian, French, and Spanish food because they are all so close together.  This is very spicy food. I like a touch of cumin to make the sweat pop. But the red sauce has that background sweetness that seems key."}
{"text":"Horrible food horrible service do not come to this place I found a hair in my food. The managers are gay literally I would never go back. Just for heads up over priced who charges for chips and salsa what cheap skates. Very unprofessional. Dirty silverware and plates nasty"}
{"text":"The hot Arizona sun beat down on two weary Light Rail travelers in search of nutrients and hydration. Thwarted by the locked doors of Bobby C's, the duo staggered down the lonely stretch of sidewalk closer to the downtown area in search of hopeful satisfaction to their escalating condition. The brawny, good-looking traveler resembling Jay Bush from the baked bean commercials produced an iPhone from his pocket and with one touch signaled the powerful Yelp mobile application to locate an oasis of food service in the area. Past the tuxedo & bridal dress shop the pair continued until at last, the colorful exterior of Los Dos Molinos shined like a beacon in the night.  What appeared to be quiet and empty on the outside surprised our duo upon entering the establishment. The main room was full, and the back room was nearly to capacity. As the host escorted our hungry travelers to their table past the signs exclaiming \"No separate checks\" and \"No substitutions\" hesitation crossed their minds. As the couple was seated, a lady from the table behind curiously asked the waiter \"Can I have a receipt?\" To which a sharp \"Do you need one?!\" reply was given. Yikes...focus on the chips...feeling hungry, the fresh chips were a welcome site - the two salsas, not so much. The green was just odd in spicy taste and appearance and the red was even more spicy. The waiter's shirt reading \"Some like it hot\" served as an explanation.    Looking around the room, busy décor including local art, figurines and the pelt of animals killed cluttered the walls. One pelt was that of a buffalo, while another looked like a road-kill wolf. The third appeared to be a Holstein cow, to which our hero wondered \"who would kill a dairy cow\" - later in our story, when the second traveler reached the mid-section of her \"bean and cheese\" burrito, an apparent remnant of the missing cow presented itself.   The second entrée was a dish including rice and a blue corn tamale, which was the male traveler's first tamale experience. He found it to be tasteful and spicy. Not as spicy as the red salsa, but a slow, increasingly intense heat that resulted in an entire pitcher of water being consumed at the table.   Leaving the restaurant full and satisfied, the duo returned to the hot Phoenix sun as their magical Light Rail returned. Perhaps the only thing hotter was the food in the restaurant behind them. The food quality was okay, but nothing special. Being starved and parched, it seemed to have served the purpose at the time, but perhaps there are better Mexican restaurants on the horizon for the two now-fed travelers...stay tuned!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while and it did not disappoint! It was wonderful homemade New Mexican cuisine with just the right amount of heat. As long as your not afraid of spicy food everything is delicious. My husband had shredded beef and chicken tacos which were extremely flavorful and I had the Avodoba ribs which were recommended by our server, AMAZING! Our server, Jorge was one of the best servers we have had at a restaurant. He was friendly, personable, attentive and passionate about the food and drinks. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Food is spicy! You order it you own it. There are other wonderful menu items that are not spicy. Enjoy your lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far one of the worst places I've ever been. The waitress was extremely unpleasant. I felt uncomfortable even asking her for something because of her attitude. When our food arrived, it was cold. I'm not talking lukewarm, I'm talking cold, and soggy. The cheese was put on as an after thought. Bagged cheese that had not melted, so just nuggets of hard, bagged cheese. Absolutely terrible. I'm surprised that I didn't get food poisoning. The only good thing that this place had going for them was the outstanding  bus boys. They were working their butts off. They actually provided 99 percent of the service. The waitress took our order and then stood in the corner and death glared us the whole time. Long story short, do not go. This is the first review that I've ever written, and my experience was that bad that I had to share."}
{"text":"This was our first stop in Phoenix and it was so great!  The indoor & outdoor decor is so quaint and cool--there's so much to see. The outdoor patio is super charming and even has misters.  I had my first Chimichanga here and it was sooo good and sooo spicy. I chose the Shredded Beef one with Green Chili and it was just great. So much flavor in every bite, super savory.  Service was super friendly and the music was loud but good.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken enchiladas with green chili sauce. Moist, flavorful, spicy, and delicious. Reasonable prices and actually spicy salsa with our free chips. Basic, casual atmosphere (which I prefer). Friendly staff. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just like goin' home to Albuquerque.  The same kitchy decor including the aqua-backlit Corona candelabra.  The great chili, green and red.  Home made tortillas.  Flavors that you won't find anywhere else West of Gallup.    Yes, it is loud.  Yes, the floors are sticky from clumsy, half-drunk ASU patrons late on a Saturday night.  But the patio is a cool place to drink a pitcher while gazing at the stars and waiting for a table.    The enchilada dinner is stacked like a proper plate should be.  The chorizo and bean appetizer is unusual.  And they even have soapapillas!  And if you think their chili is hot, wait till you get to New Mexico and try some of the real deal from Hatch!  I'd rate Los Dos as medium on a New Mexico scale and blow-your-head-off on either a California or Texas scale."}
{"text":"We've been dining at Los Dos Molinos' central location for years, and have never had a bad experience.  The ambiance is awesome, the people are wonderful, and the food - although spicy - is the best.  Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I guess spicy is a flavor at Los Dos.  Although they claim fresh ingredients everything tasted canned, under seasoned and over cooked.  The spicy nacho dip was awful as was our bartender that was slow and inattentive."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in Az, even thought it is New Mexican. Hot as hell with the hatch chilies but the flavor is still on point. Adovada Ribs are truly amazing!!!Chips and salsa are like crack that you can't stop eating even thought your mouth is on fire, this is where the margaritas come in. House margarita is really good and the kick ass margarita is even better. Absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is worth the drive through the 'hood.   It's Mexican food the way that your Mexican grandmother would have cooked it. Total home style....but seriously super spicy. I'm a fan of spicy foods, so I love Los Dos, but if you don't like it spicy, you'd better stick with Taco Bell or Macayo's.  Definitely 5 star food. I frickin' love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome spicy food!  I had the chile relleno with adovada and it was delicious!  Lots of people and parking was tight but well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"OMG, why haven't I been to Los Dos Molinos sooner?  I have been to the location down on Central & Baseline YEARS ago but with this new location opening about a year ago, I was excited to try it again.  I am so bummed that I didn't try it sooner.  It ended up on our \"list of places to go before we move\" and now I wish that we had been going here more often.   We walk in, the atmospher is really charming.  It's set up kind of like a \"cantina\" maybe?  Clean, nicely decorated and just a charming resturant overall.  They have a bar area you can sit in or they also have some dinning rooms off the bar and then some additional seating outside.  It was a bit warm out still so we opted for inside.     First round comes the chips & salsa.  You get Hot & Hotter.  If you're sensitive to spicy food, this might not be the place for you.   That being siad, their salsas are so flavorful and I crave it just as I am writing this!   Our server was really friendly and noticably attentative as were the other employees.  You never waited for anything.  It was busy too, so the service in my oppinion was fantastic for the amount of other tables.  I ordered the Chimi with red sauce. It was so yummy and it had a kick to it as well.  This rivals Ajo Al's for sure.   If you want good mexican food and a nice evening out, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Fantistically festicy, seriously spicy, and always an adventure.  This place is a Phoenix staple, there is no other place like it.  from the patio to the decor it is all one of a kind.  I like the traditional Mexican food (I recommend the Carnitas).  However, mostly everything is seriously spicy, so take the chili warnings to heart."}
{"text":"Best hot food around. I have been here many times and always hot almost to the point of too hot, but I love it! Try starting with the Mexican then the floutas with extra Sour cream to cool your mouth a bit."}
{"text":"The best New Mexican style food in the valley. Everything on the menu is great, including the drinks. Good prices, the best staff, and a great atmosphere too. My favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Food was fine but service was not good.  We had five different staff serving us at different times. This caused repetitious questions because we didn't have one person serving us. Example: three different people asked us if we were ready to order one after another and each time we said, \"not yet\" (Three times). Despite multiple servers we did not get beverage refills. My husband wanted another beer but once our food was delivered no one came back. We also asked for a chip refill and didn't get that.   Know that the chili relleno is wrapped in egg... Like an omelet.   The salsa is very good. Beans and rice are good. The meat is excellent."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 6 or so years, in my neighborhood.  Always tasty...I've had everything from the cheese crisps to the enchiladas and burritos.   Start out w/ the chips and dip--the red sauce is spicy and very good.  I like the green also.  Inside or on the patio, nice decor.  Service can be a bit slow depending on the time of day, but we always got what we ordered.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Word to the wise about los dos...they have enough of a following that they just don't give a damn about coddling customers. If you are looking to get your ass kissed, don't even bother coming here. I would call them the Honey Badgers of local restaurants. you don't like it, you can go and they won't shed a tear, because plenty of others know the drill and will still eat here.  If you want good, super spicy New Mexican food and don't need to be fussed over, this is a good place for you. They do not offer less spicy salsa options. Hot food and brusque service is their calling card. The Victoria's chicken chili is good enough that I would come here and eat it even if they peppered me with insults the whole time(which they wouldn't, I'm just saying).  Posole is good, but even better at the location on Chandler Blvd. if you like hot stuff, put on your big girl panties and give this a whirl."}
{"text":"This place serves NEW MEXICAN food, not MEXICAN food.  New Mexican enchiladas are served on thick tortillas with the \"filling\" stacked on top, rather than wrapped.  It's very spicy and also served with a fried egg on top.  New Mexican beans are also different from refried beans, so don't expect refried beans. If you come here expecting tasty, spicy New Mexican food, you'll leave happy.  If you come here expecting Mexican food, you'll be confused. Also, don't complain when the food is incredibly spicy...there's a sign on the patio with a chili pepper that says \"Some like it HOT\", so consider yourself warned!"}
{"text":"Super disappointing mediocre Mexican food (super salty) but the worst part is that it's extremely overpriced. For 2 basic combo meals plus 2 margaritas plus a al la cart quesadilla for my 3 year old with tip it was $75 bucks. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went here for a company party a while back, so we had a private room and were limited to certain items set up buffet-style, so that's probably part of the reason I can only give it four stars at this time. Cheese crisp was ok, rice was decent, and the tacos were alright. I'm not a fan of bigger chunks of green peppers, onions, etc. mixed in with ground beef, and that's how they make theirs. I was a big fan of the salsa though, if you like it HOT there is no doubt that you must give Los Dos a try. I also have to give them credit for making a vicious Margarita. I didn't try one myself (I don't do tequila), however my dad who rarely drinks polished off two before our meal just to cope with the heat of the salsa, and ended up having ME drive home, with HIM hanging out the window like a teenage kid drunk on Mad Dog 20/20 for the first time! Absolutely one of the most hilarious nights of my life, and I have Los Dos Molinos to thank. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  The location is kind of scary, for a famous place.  i was a little disappointed in their lunch menu.  i am not a fan of paying $12 for a lunch plate.  i don't need 10 lbs of food at lunch time, but a nice $4-5 plate of food at lunch would be great.  I might return by myself, because the food is very spicy, and most people i hang out with don't like that.  it was even spicy for me and i don't mind that too much."}
{"text":"The glory that is Los Dos Molinos. If you haven't been, and you are reading this review, GO! I love this place. It was how I converted my east coast husband to the religion of Mexican food. The reviewers that claim it's too hot are clearly feeble. I love the green chili. I also love the enchiladas specifically because of the thick, delicious corn tortillas. You must get a margarita too - they are huge and full of booze (in other words, exactly as they should be)."}
{"text":"17 year Los Dos addict! Salsa is very hot and so are a lot of the main dishes but there are some great mild dishes as well. Just ask!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place over the past eight years and being from New Mexico, I finally went. Overall the food was very good not sure about it being \"New Mexican\" as some of the dishes I've never seen. The salsa was great and very spicy, the green chili casserole wasn't what I was expecting but good with an egg on top! The green chili stew wasn't what I am use to for New Mexico style but had good flavor as well. Great little Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"food is spicy and has loads of flavor will come back again and try the other items as well"}
{"text":"This is just a better favorite Mexican restaurant. Have been coming here since around 2009. Got a new change today of the chili can Carney and it was amazing. But beware, it's mighty hot but mighty good. Will be back."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to grow up eating at the original location in Springerville,  AZ.   This is the first alternate location I've tried,  and all I can say is \"wow!\"   What a cool vibe,  to pair with their signature spicy food.   Excellent location, cool,  jazzy music,  very clean.   Only drawback is that it was pretty dark... As long as you already know what you want.. Perfect lighting.  The staff was amazing...attentive without being overbearing.  The food... Perhaps better than the original even,  with the same signature heat,  but a refined presentation and expanded menu.   I can't wait to come back,  and bring my family!  And remember gringos,  that little chile pepper next to menu items mean business!   If you didn't catch the clue with their amazing salsas,  you've now been warned!  (As I sit watching a poor couple struggle through their scorching yumminess,  sweating their asses off!)"}
{"text":"The food is good. The service is the worst I've ever had. Stay clear of Brett. In your face service lacking about every social skill possible. The redeeming quality of this joint is the food. Service was bad enough to make me never return. I'm all for joking around, but Brett takes it too far. To bad because not only will it hurt his pocket, it hurts the restaurants as well."}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican appetizer ever!!! Must try the chorizo dip...so good I forgot what I had for dinner. Service can be a little slow."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out since they got rated as the top 25 burritos in the country.  So let's just start with that!  I had the grande burro...excellent!  It is really one of the best I have had.  I chose the ground beef and it was really good.  The beans are very tasty also!  So the food can stand on its own.  It is good quality and tastes good.  So the part that stopped me from giving this place a great rating is a few things.  One, the service was not spectacular in any way.  Two, margaritas were not very good.  They were strong but the taste was just off.  Three, the place was hot as hell!  Everyone in there was sweating.  So I will be back for the food...but maybe once the weather cools down!"}
{"text":"If your a New Mexico native, this is where you could reminisce red and green chili from Hatch!! Totally love it!!! Chill back and enjoy"}
{"text":"Food was good as always but service was very slow and the servers did not who was taking care of what tables."}
{"text":"Los Dos is not for the weak. If you can't take heat go to taco bell. If you want real authentic delicious mexican this is the spot.  The Adobado ribs are so good I want to rub them all over my body before eating them. The shrimp (probably the least spicy thing on the menu) is served in garlc butter and the portions are generous. The rellenos are delicious and the green sauce to die for. There can be quite a wait (up to 2 hours at some points) but grab a drink and have some chips on the patio, it is worth the wait. The sangria tastes like they murdered an entire hibiscus bush to make it, but is strangely very good. I would however stay away from the margaritas, they are pretty watery. They have a sign inside that says \"Please control your kids\". AWESOME! the last thing I want is a bunch of screaming brats running around while I am trying to enjoy a meal. Now for the complaints - the staff is incredibly rude and pretentious, the wait sucks, the place is noisy, the tables are too close together, the decor is gaudy and the food will burn a hole in your mouth going in and going out... well enough said. Even though the service is poor the experience and food are a must try for any Arizonian."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had a great time.  The food was amazing!! Had the grande burrito.... So good. Try the skinny margarita... You won't be disappointed. Great place to visit!"}
{"text":"Great New Mexican food. Definitely some of the best out there. You want spicy? They GOT spicy. Pure fuego if ya catch my drift. Can't go wrong with some bomb-ass tamales or a chimi either. If I were to become president ( el presidente) I would make chips and salsa a mandatory requirement for every food-related establishment to serve...FO FREE. And you know whose chips and salsa I would use?? LOS DOS MOLINOS IN A HEARTBEAT. So think about that for a second and let it soak in. I ain't lying. Go there and experience a fantastical New Mexican food flavor explosíon. You'll see, you'll all see...."}
{"text":"I went here last night with my man and a friend because our friend likes spicy food.  The last time we were here even the beans were spicy so we thought we'd take him to try it out.  You get seated and they give you glasses and a pitcher of water right away.  I figure they do this because they know you'll be crying for water very shortly once you try the salsa.  Let me tell you, the salsa is hot!   Both the red and green are hot.  The chips are thin, warm and crispy.  The service was great.  They were right on top of things and kept our drinks full and our chip bowl stocked.  I ordered a taco, tostada and beans (no rice).   I expected the beans to be your typical refried beans with a kick but these were whole beans.  They were okay but I prefer the typical style.  These beans were not spicy at all.  I was kind of relieved because my mouth was burning from the salsa.  The tostada was very tasty once I got the extra cheese I ordered.  The taco, unfortunately, was nothing to write home about, and that's a bummer because tacos are my favorite.  I am not a fan of their beef for their tacos.  I like shredded beef and this was more like a juicy ground beef.  Not a deal breaker but I would love to have shredded beef as an option.  Our friend ordered a Mexican pizza and it was huge.  It used the same ground beef that they put in the tacos so it was just alright to me.  It was an ample serving though so this place gets points for that.  My friend didn't think any of the food was that spicy but he buys all the weird hot sauces on the market so I'm thinking he is desensitized.    This place is A-OK to me.  The service was very fast on a Tuesday night.  Maybe I should have ordered the more spicy items for my meal but I don't think my tongue could have handled it, LOL.  It's definitely worth a try but I will be sticking with my regular Mexican food spot."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and efficient. The green salsa is fresh and spicy. The enchiladas were moist and delicious. The blue corn enchiladas were served with a friend egg, which was a nice accompaniment to the entrée. We ordered the Guacamole, which was fresh and filled with chunks of avocado and onion."}
{"text":"Some like it hot.. but some like it not (me)  Yes, I can't handle heat, but it doesn't mean the food has to taste flavorless right?  Man, my wife and I were looking for good Mexican food for the second straight night in Arizona.  This place was not, here's why..  I ordered their Roasted Pork Tostada w/ taco, as it was one of the few mild items on the menu that the owner or manager did not feel to even care about, as he took my wife's order (I forgot what she had) and then mine, he was like you can't hang with the big boys? and his attitude was like ok, whatever and when I got my meal, the food tasted to me like ok, whatever.  I mean, if the food doesn't have spices, you should at least have season in it, as it was completely bland.  Poor pork, it was roasted so well and the rest of the tostada and taco were done perfectly, but without seasoning (salt), it goes no where; it should not be allowed to walk outside, as it had no clothes on type of analogy.  They placed no care on their mild items and what's sad is Bobby Flay likes them.  On top of that, my wife's dish had the spices, but even that, hers lacked seasoning as well.  This place we would not come to again and Bobby Flay, I don't trust him anymore.  Oh yeah, the drinks were not that good.  I had the Sangria Margarita, don't let it fool you, it looked great and sounded great, but it tasted sour.  The wait staff were rude and they ignored our table a lot.  I understand they were busy, but hello, we are here.. do I need to set a trap for them to stand next to our table? like to be nice, super glue?  The waitress at the end accepted our gift card, but when it did not cover the whole amount, she acted like we couldn't pay.. what the heck? fool!  Thanks for the free Cheese Crisp, but man, it is just an unfolded cheese quesadilla.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"Closes @ 9. Gr8 food. Amazing chimichangas.  One of the better places for Mexican fare."}
{"text":"This is for for the central location....I love it!   Everything is HOT, that's no exaggeration.  Flavor has always been great.  The cramped dining room has been an irritant sometimes, the Hostess has not always been that friendly (Chewing on a workers ass, not mine), the waiters get overwhelmed and forget about you at times, but I've never been disappointed with the food.  Never.  If you can handle the hot (snotty nose hot, not Taco Bell hot), and don't expect to be pampered, this place won't disappoint.  The hot is flavorful in a good way for me.  be forewarned, when I say hot, I mean HOT!  Not Taco Bell Fire Sauce hot (Joke), I mean bring milk in your purse HOT!!! And, (fifth star for this) the Chili Relleno!  Best I've ever had.  I have them everywhere I go, and none compare to this place....period.  Hatch chili's, hot as hell, big, the skin is like an omelet, not greasy batter, the sauce is divine.  No place compares so far....but I'll keep searching."}
{"text":"WOW, my meal was fantastic, atmosphere was great, kinda small, relaxed, their food was stellar!!!! I am SUPER picky when it comes to food, absolutely loved my chicken burrito, I literally gobbled it. They should however have warning labels on their Margaritas....I had the Mango Margarita and about midway through my meal realized that goblet got me trashed. By then I had already ordered a Prickley Pear Margarita...ooops...def really good drinks, but they sneak up on you. Great place tho and kid friendly!"}
{"text":"I love the shrimp Vera cruz. Great atmosphere. Frequent, and will continue to frequent."}
{"text":"One of my regulars. I love the Vera Cruz shrimp. Service is good. Great atmosphere. They lose a star because only one tortillia comes with the meal. If you work downtown PHX and haven't tried this gem... you should."}
{"text":"Really, how's this place still in business? Cheap ingredients, not prices.  With as many other Mexican places around (that offer at least decent food) I'm surprised it's still open."}
{"text":"Ordered the Queso dip and it was pretty good. However, the entrees not so much. I ordered just a basic combo plate enchilada / taco, the meat in the taco didn't taste very good as well as the red chili sauce on top of the enchilada. My friend ordered the Adovada ribs and did not like the taste of the red chile as well. We also ordered Micheladas which were good until I later discovered they were $8.75 which is Way overpriced for a beer with some Clamato."}
{"text":"Great NM-style food.  I think I've been to nearly every location, including the original in Springerville, and this is the best.  I've been here many times and had only one iffy experience at Los Dos: the food was mediocre and (gasp) NOT TOO SPICY when we went several months ago.  But don't worry, we just went again a few weeks ago, and all is well.  I ordered my usual cheese enchiladas with fried egg on top and enjoyed a Bohemia beer to help wash down the hot salsa and spicy enchilada sauce.  Yes, I will return.  And I recommend the same for you.  Just remember that on busy Friday/Saturday nights, you can expect to enjoy several margaritas in the courtyard as you wait to be seated.  They take no reservations and this is a popular gem in the South Mountain area."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years,  thought we'd revisit. Salsa is nice and hot, good chips, which is a plus. I ordered  tacos, either the shells were old or they are prepared too far in advance. Left them on my plate and ate the middle out, half the middle, anyways, the other half was some rice or something as a filler.   Staff was super friendly and efficient so for their congeniality I have the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Server was friendly, chips and salsa was delicious. My lunch was a disappointment, it looked and tasted like it was heated in the microwave. Everything was really watery and made the food soggy."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm....   Roasted Pork Green Chili Burrito!  Literally as long as my forearm and totally tasty.  I hadn't been here since they moved from their downtown location, and think the new location lacks some of the funkiness that made the old location a hit.  I definitely can't complain though, because the new place is much closer to my neck of the woods.    I can't figure out the parking though, there is not much of it, and the alley to the rear of the building is a bit narrow.  I was a little concerned about leaving my car back there even in the middle of the day.  Also, there is another lot that I saw customers parking in, but it is surrounded with barbed wire and clearly states that the parking area is owned by the car dealership not the restaurant and that violators will be towed.  Food is great though...  Just wished I was driving a rental."}
{"text":"Visited Los Dos last Thurs. night - had family visiting from out of town and they wanted \"real\" Mexican food. We had never been to the Ahwautukee restaurant, but were excited to have something closer than the S. Central location.  Horribly disappointed pretty much sums up the whole experience - the food was good, but the service and atmosphere was awful. The restaurant was only moderately busy - 4-5 tables occupied, there appeared to be several servers, but our guy kept disappearing for 10-15 minutes at a time...   There were 6 adults & a child in our party. We had called ahead and made a reservation, no one greeted us - we waited a few minutes, finally someone came up and we mentioned we had a reservation - no recognition or acknowledgement of having called ahead. We waited 5 minutes for our server to take drink orders, 10 minutes to get drinks, 10 more minutes before he came back to take our order, 25 minutes to get our food. Had to ask someone else for more drinks, salsa and chips as the server never checked back on our table. We had to go look for someone to find our server to get our check once we were finished.   We were seated right under a ceiling fan turned on full blast - had to ask to have it turned down and the Christmas music playing on continuous loop was SO loud we couldn't carry on a conversation without shouting.  Food was nice and spicy, but the atmosphere and service were so bad we left disappointed and resigned to the fact that this would not be our new \"go to\" Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I started off my experience here on a low point when I got there to try the Mexican pizza with my happy hour drink that is listed on their website and they told me that they do not have happy food at this location. Then I decided I would get an appetizer to start so I went with their corn cheese crisp. It looked like something a first grader made. Why is that even on their menu if it's going to be served like that. Not to mention the server gave us our menus and was back within 2 minutes to take our full order. It was like he was in a rush to get up off his table. Overall, the experience was more than lacking. Especially for their prices. I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"This is a Mom N Pop shop all the way. Food was good, service was OK, but I was surprised that they don't have fajitas??? Would not make a special trip back, but if your in the neighborhood, its a safe choice."}
{"text":"There is no equal to Los Dos Molinos for out of this world Mexican food.  My son loves the shrimp quesadilla, and I love the adovada.  The pasole is like my mother used to make, and what they do with just simple beans and flour tortillas is pure joy.    If you like it hot you'll be right at home, and if you like it not quite that hot you can still enjoy this sensational menu with a side of sour cream.  Recommend you always check the chalk board for Wild Hare specials as these are usually something special Victoria has put together.  My favorite is their Mac & Cheese (probably a little too spicy for children) which for a fire eater like myself was an experience I'm privileged to have enjoyed.  Much of my family is from New Mexico and when they visit Los Dos is always on the agenda.  Regardless who's visiting we're still in there once or twice a month.    There are a lot of good places to catch a bite in Ahwatukee, but Los Dos Molinos is a cultural treasure Ahwatukians can sink their teeth into!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite spots for authentic New Mexican food. It's got it a kick and the margaritas can get ya if you aren't careful but the food will knock your socks off.   I've had and recommend:  - chile relleno  - Red chile plate - tacos - tostadas  - green chile  - burros - cheese crisp  Basically everything in their menu will change your life."}
{"text":"Nothing better than Los Dos Springerville after chasing Elk in the White Mountains!  Mesa location is always consistently good.  From the moment you munch those little red and green salsa bombs of spicey awesomeness piled on your gratis chips, until you slide that last bit of flauta heaven down your piehole.  Additionally, excellent Maggies and a host of south of the border beers on tap.  Seek this casa out!"}
{"text":"I was privileged enough to have dinner here the other night for a group birthday party.  I must admit that the food was exceptional.  I grew up eating homemade Mexican food, so I'm already pretty picky when it comes to that type of cuisine.    Los Dos surprised me with their New Mexican style Mexican food.  Nice and spicy is the way I like to eat my Mexican food and they delivered just that.  Great atmosphere and friendly staff.  This will be one of my spots to indulge when I get my homemade Mexican food craving.  Green chile burrito all the way!"}
{"text":"Dined here for lunch on a weekday afternoon with a friend and thought we try this establishment since they served New Mexican cuisine. I would like to say that I am from New Mexico, and also in the food service industry, so I may be more critical. 1st of all I would like to say we had Ok service, a pitcher of water was placed at our table for us to self serve, and with prices as they are I would expect more attention placed on service.  2nd of all, food was lackluster. I ordered a pork tostada and pork taco entree which was very greasy and tasteless ( i taste more grease then anything else). Rice was bland and beans taste as though it came from a can. Definitely not what I remember of items I have enjoyed in New Mexico. Only item I did enjoy was their salsa. My friend ordered an entree which was Carne something, which he said had very little meat. It's now been 2 hours since we ate and we are hungry again.. Definitely would eat at another place next time..."}
{"text":"The food was good but spicier than I would prefer.  The salsa is soo hot that my taste buds were seared."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of spicy fare like I am, then you need to add Los Dos to your culinary bucket list.  I have been coming to the Mesa location for years now, and whenever I run into someone who also enjoys spicy food, I always go out of my way to bring them here.  The red and green salsas here are hot, as are a good portion of the menu items. If you have a weak stomach, there are milder choices on the menu - but beware of anything with the chili logo next to it. They use New Mexican chilies for these menu items, and they are hot.  My two favorite dishes here are combo plates #5 (Beef Green Chili Burro) and #6 (Machaca Burro) - both enchilada style with rice and beans. These go down great with a glass or two of Dos Equis Lager.  I usually visit Los Dos during the lunch hour, and the parking lot can be a zoo if you arrive during the peak of the lunch rush. Save yourself some frustration and plan on getting here a little earlier than normal for lunch (and don't make the mistake of parking in a marked space from a neighboring business). For dinner, I've arrived at 5pm and found only two other tables occupied, but that doesn't last long - by 5:45 the place is filling up pretty fast.  I was a little surprised by some of the other reviews regarding service here. I have yet to have a bad experience here, but it is somewhat of a hot spot, so with that comes a little pain. As far as price goes - it is somewhat more expensive than other Mexican restaurants, but it's not like I'm eating here every week, so not a big deal for me.  What I like the most about Los Dos Molinos is that it is not just about the heat - it's about flavor. Anything that completely kills your taste buds is a loser in my opinion, but these guys know how to mix the right combination of the two together, and the result is perfection."}
{"text":"We had our company Christmas Party there.  Before closing, the staff turned the lights out over half our table.  The darkness was so overwelming, that we all forgot what we were even talking about.  When we were leaving our ruined party, we spoke to the staff about this.  They responded that \"we all have families to go home to.\"  They don't care about their customers' experiences there.  I will never go there again.  Not even an \"I'm sorry!\" from them."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  My chile relleno was great and the Prickly Pear frozen margarita was amazing......and I am a self-proclaimed margarita connoisseur!  Yes, we were told that the food here is spicy, but I thought it was great.....and preferred the green salsa."}
{"text":"Good flavors, quick service awesome chips and salsa and one margarita and you are set. The Food is reasonable and they have spicy and non spicy food for those who can't handle the heat like some of my family. When I need to go out for Mexican food this is usually one of my first choices."}
{"text":"Not a good place for large groups.  They gave the check to the wrong guy even though I told our server to give me the check.  Before I knew the poor guy got it he had already paid.  Horribly embarrassing for me, and it would have never happened if I had chosen a restaurant that was more skilled with large groups.  Awesome good mexican food, though.  I would recommend Los Dos for very casual meals with no more than 4 people."}
{"text":"Love this place. My gf and I went today after accidentally finding it next door to a hardware store we went to go get keys made at. Staff was very friendly and very attentive. A very latest back environment where any dress code is acceptable.   The food wasn't five star. We ordered the queso dip for an appetizer, which if you are into instant gratification, then this is right up your alley, because I could feel my arteries clog with each bite. It was great. A big pile of freshly fried tortilla chips sprinkled with melted cheese and a hot skillet with a greasy mess of five different cheeses all mixed together. Filling and probably best split between at LEAST two people.   In ordered the chicken burro platter which was more than I could eat; and let me tell you, I can eat. It was huge chunks if moist and tender chicken wrapped on a tortilla smothered in green chilli. Even the rice and beans were good. Most Mexican restaurants the rice and beans are just a waste of space but in left no bean unturned when filling my to-go box.   Jen had the Machaca Taco plate to the same effect. The meat was seasoned well and was moist and cook perfectly.   We has a NA beverage each, an appetizer, our entrees, and the bill with 20% tip was barely $40; and it covered both our lunches for tomorrow.   I can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes I've been reading about."}
{"text":"I've driven past Los Dos Molinos many times and always wanted to go in.  Finally finding the opportunity to try the food, my daughter and I ventured in and found a table.  We were well attended during our visit.  Two salsas arrived at our table -- green and red.  The red is the hotter of the two, and both have substance.  I ordered the green chili enchiladas because green chili is spicier than red chili, and who doesn't like enchiladas.  It came with an egg sunny side up.  I would add an egg to the top of most my meals if I could, so it is nice that I didn't need to place a special request.  My daughter had her usual cheese and bean burrito.  At Los Dos Molinos, it is called a burro.  We both enjoyed our meals.  The restaurant layout invite patrons to return during the warm, but not hot months of the year.  The doors were left open and there is a patio out back for dining and the consumption of alcohol."}
{"text":"Awesome New Mexico type Mexican food. I've been here at least a gross times!!!  Mom's original spicy pork stew is what I always seem to get, although everything on the menu is very good, its got huge chucks of potatoes, huge pork chunks, delicious pork based stew and has a spicy kick.  I've tried nearly everything on the menu... but 1 blue corn tamale and the stew with a side order of tortillas always seem to be my goto order.  The stew is a 9/10, but I warn you... the heat level can be hot! (Not quite habanero level, but close and it can vary with the seasons)  The margaritas on the rocks are always heavy, but delicious. Watch out! Not as popular, but very sweet tasting, are their frozen margarita.... but despite being extra sweet and like a slushie... it packs a hidden punch....Dont be surprised if only two of these gets you buzzed...I warned you!   The enchiladas are great, most meals (but not the stew) come with the typical Mexican rice and beans, and the typical stuff.  Tacos are big, good, and extra tortillas are soft, fluffy and warm.  Chips and salsas are good, you can tell it was made that day, they have both a red and a green, but we always argue which is hotter, so try both.  And lastly, the sopapillas are delicious for desert with the honey!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix my entire life and therefore have eaten at countless Mexican food places so I did not expect this place to stand out. But I must say they food definitely has its own uniqueness! The salsas were delicious and different from any other restaurant and their food menu was unique as well. I had the stacked enchiladas, which were really really good. The sauce was so good. Also they are not stingy with the meat like most places- another bonus. Service was fast and attentive. Drinks were large and stayed topped off. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've seen this place from the bus and now the light rail when coming into work for a while now.  Friday, I got stuck working very late, and my boss took me to dinner when we were done with our project as a thank you.  She wanted something mexican, and close to the office.  She said that she loved this place, so she took me here.  Walking in, I liked the decore of this place.  Authentic looking, and seemed cute!  Thats where the niceities stop.  We walked in and were seated.  The service was absolutely HORRIFIC.  I was blatently ignored, but my boss was waited on as if she were the queen.  I have a theory about why, but I dare not write it down here, for fear of backlash.  I had to scream at the server halfway across the resturant when he refused to take my drink order.  I was astounded!  When he took my order, it was as if he were doing me a favor...horrible.  Food was HOT.  So spicy that I was unable to eat it.  Why cant they state that in thier menu?  My  boss thought it was hysterical because I turned 7 shades of red from the spicy-ness.  lol.  Anyways, the next day the food was better from my fridge, I just wasn't expecting a mouth full of spicy hot food.  lol.  Anyways, I will not be returning to this craptastic shithole.  Never again.  Service was aweful, and the food was just WAY to spicy for me.  I can get Mexican food just as decent with substantially better service at a spice level I can handle at about a zillion different places in this town.  Stay away from this place! Its horrible!"}
{"text":"Fabulous! Guacamole is fresh and perfect. Pork Roast burrito is amazing. Salsa is very flavorful."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE food and service. Waiter was older man who was extremely RUDE when we asked for lunch specials and senior discounts. Never offered water refills food took forever and WE WERE THE ONLY ONES THERE. Acted like the 3 of us were a bother to him. Had to ask 4 times for to go boxes. Food was so BAD we took it with us and looked for homeless people to give it too. This place has no consideration for customer satisfaction at all. I would eat off a taco truck before coming to this excuse of a food establishment. This is Phoenix not BEVERLY hills so lose your attitude and serve EATABLE FOOD! Don't waste your money people Taco Bell has better food."}
{"text":"We ate dinner last night, and realized afterwards we hardly enjoyed most of our meal.  The chips and salsas were great, but the entrees were bland and nearly tasteless,  despite the sauces.  My prawns were under cooked, hubbies first delivery of his entree was incorrect, and returned with the right meat but with unmelted cheese on top. His carne asada was pink in the middle, and neither of our  meats had any seasoning, at all.   After drinking a pitcher of their high test margaritas, we realized that we hadn't even copped a buzz.   What's happened to Los Dos Molinos?  Has expanding their business diluted their quality control and oversight?  Our family favorite severly disappointed us last night."}
{"text":"I first tried the Los Dos on Camelback for happy hour. It was amazing! Imagine my excitement when I realized there was one right up the street from my house in Ahwatukee. I couldn't wait to have one of the amazing margaritas and perfectly seasoned beef tacos.  What a complete disappointment! This location does not have any food on happy hour. They had a selection of premade margaritas (I'm not sure who would want that). I opted for the handmade, it was large and tasted like some sort of premade lemonade not an $11 margarita. My group ordered guacamole, hard tacos and the shrimp ajo. The guacamole was nothing to write home about and  overpriced. The shrimp ajo was very good with amazing rice and beans. The hard beef tacos were some of the worst tacos I have ever had. Brittle tasteless shell, giant chunks of lettuce and tomato, the beef was dry, hard and tasteless.  I didn't even know a taco could be that disappointing. I ended the happy hour expedition with an $80 tab and complete regret. If you want to try Los Dos go to another location."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. I've yet to try a margarita here but I hear they are good. I can't get enough of their been chimi. And their sour cream is so delicious!!!! I always leave here with a food baby."}
{"text":"The Avadado ribs are great.. the tortillas were homemade and just wonderful.. the food is some of the spiciest I have had but so damn good..  the staff was very Friendly and attentive..  if you want great Mexican food.  There is none better!!!"}
{"text":"After 35 minutes, the adults still hadn't received their drinks and 1 of the 2 kids' drinks were incorrect. We sat without being greeted for 20 minutes and that was after 2 different servers came outside and saw we weren't greeted. We had to leave. Server didn't seem too surprised we were leaving. Terrible first, last, and only impression."}
{"text":"First let me tell you that this Is my fist food review that I have written in Yelp.  I should reward those restaurants that not only have great food but also deliver great service.  This restaurant was not one of them.  I went to eat there tonight based on a recommendation from a friend.  The food was average.  We were in Phoenix this past summer and this Mexican restaurant does not in even come close on quality of food or service to the Mexican restaurant we went to this summer.  It started  off with chips and salsa.  The best part of dinner.   Now the main course.  We ordered enchiladas.  My daughter ordered the chicken with red sauce and I ordered the beef with green sauce.  This is where the problem started.  I asked for green and beef but was given red sauce with chicken.  What also happened was that they put the enchilada on my wife's plate with her entree.  They ended up taken it back to the kitchen and separated the two different orders but no apology.   I was fine no issues.  However I explained to our waiter that I ordered a different enchilada with beef and green sauce and that I may have gotten someone else's order.  The waiter looked st his tablet  and said you ordered the chicken with green sauce .  I know I ordered the beef with green sauce but if he says chicken no reason to argue.  I then said okay but I ordered it with green sauce he said  I quote \"are you okay with that?\" Are you kidding me.  I am like whatever.  I am not going to send my food back and complain about this.  I just wanted to let them know they messed up my order.  I was hoping for an apology or something.  I got nothing.  Finally, our bill came. Hold on tight for this one.   They came over with their tablet and told me the total for the bill.  No breakdown of the items you ordered.  They wait until you give them cash or a card.  My bill was $35 and change.  By the way, I was planning to leave a 20% tip.  I gave the waiter $40. The waiter came back with $2 and change.  Not sure what happened to some of the money.   Funny math?  I am not saying don't go there but be aware the food is okay and the service is terrible.  I will not be back.   Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and margaritas! If you're looking for some spicy authentic Mexican food this is the place!"}
{"text":"WOW! Excellent New Mexican food. The Adovada tamale was so delicious - very flavorful pork with the Hatch chili sauce. The chicken sopapillas with green chili sauce were amazing. We got there before opening time and were invited in to enjoy chips, salsas and margaritas. Gracious and friendly service, delicious food, creative dishes and desserts. Yep, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place probably serves delicious green chili dishes.  However, this review is for the red beef enchiladas.  Hot and spicy..but shockingly lacking in flavor.  And definitely not the deep red New Mexico red chili I grew up loving. Too bed.. I was really excited."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! We will not be eating at this location every again! It is worth the drive to Mesa to get better service. They are not consistant and charge for chips and salsa which is a big no no when it comes to mexican restaurants. While the food is great, we cant go to this location anymore because we always leave in a pissed off mood. Save yourself the time and money and hit up one of their other locations!"}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos was recommended to us by a fellow Tennessean, and she was right!  The food there was delicious and perfectly seasoned but not expensive. The waiters were friendly and helpful. I recommend the place."}
{"text":"I didn't think the food was that good. The refried beans Were not mashed like I'm accustomed to. The cheese crisp was so so. The waitress tried to hurry us even though the restaurant wasn't that busy.  Very noisy with loud music couldn't hear myself think. I think the food used to be better."}
{"text":"I've definitely experienced better in the Los Dos family of restaurants.  The menu warns about how hot and spicy the food is.  I suppose if you were a mid-westerner staying here on vacation, it might be hot, but in terms of local cuisine, it's hardly hotter than what you would get at a Denny's.  Service was slow as we were seated on the patio.  It took a while to get drinks, and my Jalapeno margarita was served in what appeared to be a leftover potted-plant container  It was square.  Yes, it was large, but that does not equal good.  I could hardly taste the tequila, and I guess what made it \"Jalapeno\" was the pickled Jalapeno they dropped into it.  I'd say pass on this and just get iced tea.  We started with a queso appetizer, which was okay, nothing threatening there.  It took a while to get the appetizer, and when it arrived, we scarfed it down from starvation.  I personally ordered the shredded beef chimi with green sauce, which should have left me hot and bothered, but I was only bothered, there was no hot.  This was my second visit here, the first time our food was so salty as to be practically inedible, and this time, while it did have flavor, it was missing the most important component that Los Dos is known for.  Unfortunately, there won't be a third visit."}
{"text":"Will not be eating here again...they have had repeated health code violations: https://envapp.maricopa.gov/EnvironmentalHealth/FoodSearchInspection?p=FD-48174&i=0"}
{"text":"This location gets three stars and the original location on Central Ave. gets five stars.  This place just seemed like a normal \"mom and pop\" Mexican restaurant.  Salsas were not what I remember them to be.  Food was fine, the red chili pork was not the best i had ever had. The flautas were just  \"eh\".    Just a regular ol'mexican restaurant in my book.  I go back to the Central location next time and not this one."}
{"text":"Pretty good New Mexican restaurant. The reason for 3 stars is the amount of spice on most if the food. I love spivey food as long as it adds to the taste of the dish. The salsa was a little too spicy for the general public who might not be used to it. The quality of food was really good and the ambiance was casual and inviting."}
{"text":"We eat at Los Dos Molinos every time we are in the valley and have been to three of their locations. This location by far has the fastest service! We love the heat here, the tamales, adovado, chile relleno and the top shelf margaritas are our favorites."}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars I would. This place is disgusting and has terrible service. While there I saw three bugs, one that was crawling on our table. It took forever for them to take our order and also to bring the food out. Ordered the red chili burrito & it was the worst thing I've ever had. Not sure how people think this is authentic mexican food. It tasted like crap. Not to mention how overly priced it was. I will not be going back there.   Thanks for ruining my night!!!!"}
{"text":"Traveling from out of state. Was recommended by my uncles broker. green & Red Salsa was very good. Chili Rellenos and carnitas were very good. would return.  Staff very friendly"}
{"text":"Not the best New Mexican restaurant I have been to.  I would not go back. The food is not that impressive.  I did like their cheese crisp though. I think Richardson's has better New Mexican food than this. Service was pretty good."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Los Dos three nights in a row one week. This is my favorite Place for Mexican food. I am half Mexican and a stickler about salsa, and their salsa is the closest to what my grandmother used to make when I was a kid. The food is ALWAYS spot on and truly legit as far authenticity is concerned. The staff is very attentive and they always do a great job of making their customers feel welcome and cared for. When my family comes into town Los Dos is the first place that they want to go. The atmosphere, food, and service is top notch and has NEVER disappointed me.  The place is clutch and is essentially one of the best restaurants that reside in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I am still a fan of this place even if it seems to have gotten a little stale. Nothing ever changes here, including the daily specials. It would be nice to see some new menu items.  Salsa and chips are always good and HOT. We love the chorizo dip. Adovada ribs aren't the best, they really should try to get better meat.  The marq's are tasty but a little overpriced. All that said it is a favorite of guests from out of town due to its charm and hot food."}
{"text":"If you don't like hot spicy food don't go here. Starting with the salsa it is a pure capascium burn. Really tasty. I prefer the Mesa location over the Phoenix location based solely on the fact that I rarely have to wait, while at the Phoenix location (Which has more ambience) there is often a wait.  I love the chorizo dip, even if it isn't listed they will make it for you. The green chili is also very good. Service is generally very good, even on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I was sad to only give Los Dos 3 stars. I love the other locations but the Camelback location has some major service issues. The food however is still outstanding if you like super hot New Mexican style food. I love the chorizo dip. As I said though the service left a lot to be desired. Super slow. Had to ask repeatedly for our water to be refilled.  I will visit Los Dos again, just not this location."}
{"text":"The decor is what drew me and my boyfriend into this place, everything is very beautiful and service is also great. I ordered the red chili posole with pork and it was delicious and reminded me of my grandmothers cooking in New Mexico. By the time I was done eating I didn't want to leave the restaurant, such a nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"While in town we wanted to find a great Mexican restaurant and this was recommended. As others have said, this is New Mexican style. I didn't know the difference (and probably still wouldn't) until I read about it.  A lot of the reviews talked about the heat of the dishes so we were prepared and like spice. The red sauce served with chips had a lot of heat but don't let that alarm you. The food we ordered was excellent and was not overly spicy. We tried the Relleno de carne adovada and the Carne adovada chimi with green sauce. Both were excellent!  Add on a pitcher of Kick Ass Margaritas and your meal is set."}
{"text":"There is no better old school-style Mexican food in the valley. The wait is never as long as your friends have complained that it is and the food is great! Get a pitcher (or two) of sangria and the enchiladas (red) with a fried egg!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in AZ! Genuinely spicy with lots of tasty green and red chiles. Perfect balance of heat and flavor. Potent margaritas, too!"}
{"text":"Food was OK+.  There are much better alternatives than this place.  Service was very good.  Food was HOT, which I expected and usually like, but the spiciness of the food wiped out the flavor."}
{"text":"If I could give zero star I would. Awful policies....I asked them to put my beans on a separate plate but Then I would get charged extra....just to slap it on a separate plate.  I then asked for an extra empty plate and they charge you extra for that.   This place really needs to rethink their policies, they could care less about customers. At least the server was nice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican/New Mexican restaurant. Excellent service, food, and drinks. The food is quite spicy and prepared very well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Too bad this place use to be a mortuary before it was a restaurant. I'll be sure to go to other locations so I can keep experiencing amazing New Mexico cuisine."}
{"text":"My husband and sister-in-law are from New Mexico, so we wanted to try this place out. We had heard good things.  The chips were okay. Nothing fresh or extraordinary. The salsas packed a punch, as promised, and were quite fresh. The New Mexicans approved heartily.  The menu doesn't offer much in the way of healthy choices, so I went for the chicken taco salad. The item I received was quite literally that. It was a large platter with a very lonesome deep-fried shell with salad inside. It wasn't much bigger than a standard taco but cost $10. The shredded chicken on top was quite good, but I was really disappointed at the severe lack of... salad. There was very little iceberg lettuce there, and underneath that were beans that completely soaked through the bottom of the shell as well. To one side, a large tortilla chip had a scoop of sour cream and a scoop of guacamole. The guac was completely smooth and had no flavor at all. Since most of the menu boasts of a high heat level, it's like their non-hot items went to a bland extreme. I was pretty disappointed.  My husband and sister-in-law liked their enchiladas, though, and said the sauces added a lot of flavor and the meat was well done. My husband didn't like that the only side options were beans and rice.   I would advise going elsewhere to use the bathroom, too. The ladies' room was extremely cramped. This is the first time I've had to say this in a Yelp review, but... the toilet paper was not good.   So, the red and green sauces and the meats were well done, but we were not enthused by our experience. We wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"Keeps getting better. Please order the pork stew. Absolutely one of the best things I've eaten in Phoenix. Their \"freshest\" margarita is incredible and the salsas are extremely authentic to New Mexican Chilis."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant.  The shredded  beef tacos were amazing, however the service let a lot to be desired. It would be worth trying another location."}
{"text":"I had possibly the worst Mexican meal that I've ever eaten here. I had been out furniture shopping with my roommate when we decided we were a bit peckish. After trying to decide what we wanted to eat while exploring the less-than-grandiose night-time stylings of Mesa's \"Fiesta District\", we settled on Mexican because of the need for slow-cooked food and spice at a proper sit-down restaurant. This was not that restaurant.  The menu is confusing and the waiter was really of no help. He had to read the menu himself to try to understand what was in the dishes we asked about. He also made mention that he had not tried the food (at least, the food we ended up ordering). Seeing no Carne Asada offerings on the menu, we chose two dishes with the Machaca Beef. I had the \"Chef's Special: Stuffed Sopapillas-Two sopapillas stuffed with your choice of meat, served with rice/beans, enchilada style Christmas $12.95\" My roomie got the Machaca Beef in another iteration that's not even worth remembering. We were actually quite hungry so we started in on the chips and salsa that were brought to the table. Red sauce - too hot (and I like it pretty hot). Green sauce - too hot. To remedy the situation, I asked if we could order a side of queso dip. This really confused the waiter (apparently, a hot cup of cheese to dip tortilla chips in was unfathomable at this Mexican restaurant). What we were brought was a strange greasy flour tortilla chip nacho platter with an unidentifiable warm green sauce in the middle. Bland food service cheese on greasy flour tortilla chips (which were more like soft crackers) did not inspire us for the impending meal (and they call this an \"appetizer\").  Long story short, everything we ordered was a complete misfire. The Machaca Beef was not so much spicy (as advertised on the menu with an asterisk to indicate \"spicy New Mexican chili\"), as it was so salty as to be nearly inedible. The rice and beans were flavorless and bland. The pictures posted on Yelp don't look like what we were served. Beans were dry... no sauce. We didn't come close to finishing our plates. We ate just enough to kill some nagging hunger pangs and then pushed the rest aside. I don't know how you can screw up simple Mexican staples such as rice, beans, and a tortilla stuffed with meat and covered with sauce... but they did a bang-up job of robbing this meal of any possible flavor. Come to think of it, they kinda robbed me. I won't be back and I can't understand how this place gets an average of 4 stars on Yelp. By any measure, the food here was horrid."}
{"text":"If you want spicy salsa, try Los Dos Molinos. It was tasty and the chips were good. The food was pretty good and I would definitely go back.  My friend and I are both from NM and we were happily surprised. It is the closest to NM food so far that I have found here in AZ. If they had ground beef as the norm for the tacos, enchiladas and burritos it would be right there. I liked it and so did my friend. I will take my girlfriend there and we will probably make it a regular place to eat for our NM food craving."}
{"text":"Just plain great. Very hot if you like it that way or reasonably hot if you're not up for it.  Food is amazing and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Was in town visiting a Friend & he suggested we eat here.  The food was great, very clean and the waiter was super nice and on top of everything.  Not once did we have to keep our eye out for him to come around to ask for anything, nor did our cups ever run dry.  The food was delicious and very authentic."}
{"text":"Went to lunch at Los Dos Molinos today and was impressed once again. I always like to ask the server what their favorite thing on the menu is and hate it when I get the most expensive response, today I didn't! I was recommended to the Chicken Enchilada plate. I am normally not an enchilada type of guy, not enough substance for me and usually too much tortilla. However these proved me wrong.  The enchiladas were piled high with moist shredded chicken and covered in Green Chile(not for the faint if heart). Then it was all brought together by melted cheese which was crisped to perfection. Another great experience at Los Dos however if this is your first time there is a reason why each table gets its own pitcher of water!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my coworkers. Unfortunately we could not drink an margaritas because we had to go back to work, but the drink menu looked interesting.  Overall, good food. I really enjoyed the New Mexico chili spices.  The food was spicy but not overbearing as I had been previously warned. I I ordered the adovado soft tacos.  Adovada was TASTY; tender, soft, moist, everything you want and more from meat. The rice and beans were standard.  Service was okay, nothing outstanding. I had to get up and ask the server for drink refills."}
{"text":"Quiet little place, great place to stop after work with friends. Beware the salsa is hot hot hot! There is no such thing as mild here, but the food is great."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorites in Scottsdale! The salsas and dishes are all super spicy so try this place if you like your food spicy! Even the beans had a kick to them that I really loved. (They will make everything milder if you ask.) I would recommend any adovada dish, but the entire menu is pretty incredible. There are few places where I would feel as comfortable recommending the menu as a whole, but the Mesa location Los Dos Molinos is pretty exceptional."}
{"text":"Jet lag and tight schedule in Phoenix wouldn't  keep me away from my favorite Mexican restaurant in the US. Yes, it's HOT but the flavors are amazing. Did the Green chile plate. It is outstanding.  I've never noticed a lower quality at the Mesa location as indicated in a previous review.   They couldn't have topped the dish tonight.  Don't miss it. Wish their remote branch in Manhattan was still open :-("}
{"text":"friendly service, but very disorganized. Took them over an hour to serve us our dinner even though they weren't that business. I don't think they had any designated server to look after our table - so it all depended upon one very harried guy remembering to come by every half hour to check if were doing ok. Chili Rellenos was subpar and the special that my wife had (mahi tacos) was over done. The staff were really trying and seemed to care , but totally mis-managed and dis-organized or perhaps understaffed. That was kinda disappointing since the food and service at the Los Dos in mesa used to be pretty good....."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews about service, it's slow. To me it doesn't seem like they have enough staff. The 2 people working the restaurant were also both working the bar. We waited a significant period of the to have anyone come by and take our orders.   I would like to say the food was worth the wait, but it wasn't. My wife's stacked chicken enchiladas were, let's just say different. Chicken between two thick masa cakes. Not really like flat enchiladas. She didn't care for them at all. I had the adovada burrito enchilada style. It wasn't anything like carne adovada you get in New Mexico (I live there and I know good carne adovada). Enchilada style apparently means we put a little drizzle of \"chili sauce\" on the top, not smother the burrito in chili. Not worth the extra $2 I paid for that. Overall a very disappointing experience  Definitely NOT Rio Grande Valley New Mexican food and not to our liking."}
{"text":"Some like it hot. And so do I. But Los Dos Molinos wasn't hot, at least not for me. I have heard for years how good and how hot it was, so my expectations were high. The restaurant is kind of small, with tables in the bar area (no booths) and patio seating. It is decorated southwestern, rich pastel colored paintings, animal skins and Indigenous weaponry.  The menu is traditional Mexican, enchiladas, tacos, etc.  We were seated quickly and served chips and salsa, one red and one green. The red a little spicier than the green.  Our meals came quickly. The beans are refried with whole beans, not as pasty as what I am used to, but good. The rice was almost a little crispy, like it had been baked or heated in the oven, and also good. The main courses were good, too. Not great, but good. I can have good Mexican food a lot of places and for a lot less than $40 for two people (dinner, drinks, tip). And I am still wondering what about Los Dos Molinos is so hot. I guess I missed it."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years, and it's the best Mexican food in the Valley. John is always a welcoming host, and the carnitas are my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is amazing one of my all-time favorite places to go eat if you don't like spicy foods you should not go. The enchilada dinner is the best and their margaritas are so good The staff is nice friendly and very helpful. Definitely going to be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  The food is spicey and delicous. go Green ! And dint forget a tasty prickly pear marg or premium tequila shot!"}
{"text":"Asked my server about which dishes were good but not too spicy (telling him that I can only handle medium at most), and he recommended the garlic pork roast. I also ordered some chorizo and nacho cheese dip as an appetizer.  When the chorizo nacho cheese dip came, it was so incredibly hot that I was unable to even suffer through more than a couple of bites of it. I mean, it was more spicy than their salsa (which is saying something). This is coming from someone who usually puts about three fire sauce packets on his tacos. It was ridiculously hot.  The garlic pork roast was pretty good, though!  Side note: They apparently have a warning on the menu that states you can't return items that are too hot. I did not realize this when I ordered the chorizo nacho cheese dip, so the manager made a one time exception and gave me a refund. Normally they don't give refunds for spicy food, though, so make sure that you can handle very spicy stuff before ordering!"}
{"text":"We came up from Tucson to have fun with friends. We decided to go out for cinco de mayo, I looked up on yelp and it had some good reviews and the menu sounded good. Well, it wasn't the case! It took forever just for someone to come over and take our drink selection..... then another forever wait to get them. Yes, I understand what day it was but we came in late and they were not very busy at that time. We FINALLY ordered and it was not good at all. I got a shrimp dish and the shrimp were not cooked. Everyone else we came with was not happy either. Yes, they asked if I wanted something else and normally I wouldn't but I was very hungry I got the chicken burrito and pretty much it was just shredded chicken in a flour tortilla... nothing special at all. Will not be coming back to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area. I've taken out of town friends and they love it, as long as they like things just a bit spicy.  The building is kind of a hole in the wall place which adds to the experience. Apparently it used to be a barn or stable... but they did a great job decorating. I don't come here for great service so I don't mind the lack of service. My food has always come quick and my glass stays full of my favorite beverage so I'm a happy camper.  If you are visiting town for one night and want an experience, Los Dos Molinos is a great one!"}
{"text":"Having spent years in Southern New México, I am always on the hunt for a great Chile Relleno.  Unfortunately this is not my kind of Chile Relleno.  There was an egg batter and no breading so no crunch. More like a smothered omelette. The sauces red and green both carry a slightly tangy flavor making it taste like it has an industrial preservative.  The beans were funcky tasting as well.    The service was quite good and the dinning room was quite fun. Lots of interesting history throughout.  I would consider meeting a friend for a beer here but the four plates of food we had convinced me not to return to eat."}
{"text":"It's probably no surprise but, we can't get Mexican food like this in Savannah. I'm not an expert, but this seemed so authentic and fresh, albeit very, very spicy.   Margaritas (two pitchers consumed by three of us) were made with just squeezed lime juice instead of the sweet syrupy mix every Mexican place serves back home. The corn chips were fresh fried hot rather then reheated, or worse room temperature, as in Savannah. And, they actually tasted like corn! Their guacamole got three thumbs up, with one diner abstaining saying he felt it was too mellow. The others, by the way, saw it as a good counterpoint to the red and green chili salsas, which were judged hot and hotter..   Two, of our party of four, were sensitive to spicy food. It should be noted that although Los Dos Molinos' menu is careful to annotate spicy food as such, that the majority of their offerings fall under this category. Our two gringos with mild tastes ordered the carnitas (slow cooked pork) and chicken flautas with guacamole and sour cream. (Curiously, he felt the flautas needed more flavor.) The remaining two diners (one female/one male) were eager to \"man up\", respectively ordering the adovada ribs in red chili and the enchilada dinner with chicken, red chili and a fried egg. Both were highly appreciated and savored with great relish, although there was a price to pay throughout the wee hours of the following morning for this writer.   To add to the attack upon our four digestive systems, we opted to split an order of the sopapilla with everything, aka deep fried dough with honey, sugar and Cinnamon. Very tasty indeed.  Service was prompt, pleasant and especially helpful in assisting us as we worked our way through a menu peppered with chili IEDs. The kitchy environment seemed a bit out of context, but was fun none the less. Some might consider pricing a tad high, our bill before tip was just over $100, but it was supported by the quality of the food, and we drank alot.   I'd return to Los Dos Molinos in a heartbeat, although I'd be sure to stock up on Pepcid first."}
{"text":"We arrived at 8, were told it was a two hour wait on the patio, and we were seated within an hour.  Waiting with perfect margaritas was great--but the salsa choices suck and the chips were a little stale.  There's red-hot red and fiery tomatillo, and the gringo in our group couldn't enjoy chips n salsa at all.  Maybe there's a third option they don't tell you about?  I dunno.  The red salsa tasted like the red peppers you sprinkle on pizza, blended with oil in a Cuisinart.  Not my favoritestyle--I prefer a touch more of the tomato.  My carnitas were pretty bland, frankly, but everything else our table ordered was pretty solid.  Chimis and enchiladas with flavorful, nasty-hot green and red sauces.  This is one place where I'd actually order a hamburger on the side for your out of town guests, just in case they can't stand the heat.  A Phoenix legend that everyone should try for themselves.  I got unlucky this time with my order--ten years ago I remember loving whatever I had."}
{"text":"This place is great for people who like spicy food. Usually I'm skeptical when I see a chili pepper indicating that an item on the menu is \"hot\", but Los Dos Molinos does not lie! The adovada ribs and spicy shrimp are BLAZING HOT. I must give the cooks credit though, because they are very flavorful dishes and the heat does not overwhelm the actual flavor of the food and spices."}
{"text":"Food is great as always but don't come on cinco de mayo if you expect any service. They are definitely short on servers.  Long wait to get in and then to be served"}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here! Unless you order shrimp. the last two times I did it was only cooked on one side. Seriously the one side was still clear silver raw shrimp. And the other time not one shrimp of the dozen or so in the dish had been cleaned! Huge black veins down the back of each one. Both meals were not even tasted! just tossed right in the garbage. Other than that it's my favorite Mexican food in town."}
{"text":"This place was rough. Their neon sign wasn't on tonight. We should have just assumed they were closed and moved on. The host was great. He sat us right away, and brought water and chips and salsa. We waited 15 minutes for the server to come and take our order. He didn't introduce himself or ask if we had any questions; he was very abrupt. I ordered the taco and enchilada combo, and my fiancé ordered the carnitas plate. He said his food was average. The shredded beef taco was good. The meat had nice flavor and texture. The enchilada was awful. The red chili sauce was so spicy, and it had lots of seeds and chili skins in it. The texture and flavor were not good. We waited another 15 minutes until our server came back with the check. I wouldn't go back here."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here at least once a week.  Food is delicious and the staff very friendly!  Machaca Beef Burrito with red sauce is to die for as is the chorizo pizza appetizer. Sometime I might try some other things, but right now I can't get enough of these two items!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!! So good, authentic, fresh Mexican food! Great flavor and for those who like spice there are some special options for you! Fresh chips and tortillas. Very rustic outdoor courtyard seating. Towards the evening the night life started coming through and everyone looked to be having a great time. Nothing crazy just fun and family friendly. Everyone says to try it if you are visiting, I took my mother and she was thrilled!"}
{"text":"Hot, spicy, and tasty food. A little slow on the service. Waited way to long to get water and drinks at the table while the ladies were burning from the hot salsa. I recommend this place just be ready for a loooong dining experience."}
{"text":"How anyone can come away from the food and drink here not evaluating it as a solid 5 amazes me.  Even if the floor was crawling with rats and the servers were drunk and abusive, I would still come back for the privilege to eat their amazing cuisine again.  What else can I possibly say?"}
{"text":"Food is not good! Rice was almost crunchy. The tamales were the worst I've ever had. And they serve RC cola. Really? In Arizona where I pride ourselves on our Mexican food, this place doesn't even hold up to par."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here twice and dinner last night.  The green chile pork stew is the most flavorful stew I've ever put in my mouth, restaurant or homemade, and the sopapillas that come with it are the best I've ever had and hot out of the pot.  Even the Mexican rice is tastier and moister than anywhere else, and for dessert we had one of their pumpkin empanadas, to die for.  Friendly, efficient service, generous portions.  Worth searching out and easy to get to via 60, take the Alma School Road exit.  Don't overshoot and turn into the garage next door, not a lot of room in the little lot to back and fill so you can get out again."}
{"text":"I like it hot! That's why my favorite (New) Mexican restaurant is by far Los Dos Molinos. I have been to every Los Dos in America, yes America! All be it, I have only been to the NYC location once but, it was everything I expect from my local Los Dos.   Every dish in this restaurant is hot. It says right on the front of the menu that they don't know how to make \"mild\". (My mother says the air in the restaurant is hot!) My favorite dish is the adovada ribs with a few extra tortillas and some guac. There is nothing hotter on the menu, so if you can finish this dish without having to suck on a fire extinguisher, you are a true champion! Otherwise take it home and heat up the leftovers with a fried egg for breakfast. Also get a pitcher of the \"Kick Ass\" margaritas; they live up to the name."}
{"text":"After months of avoiding Los Dos Molinos in favor of places with better service and margaritas, we decided to return last Saturday night and give the place another chance. We were actually even less impressed with the experience than last time.   My blue corn enchiladas were still quite good, but my husband's chimichanga was just average. I guarantee you that you can get a better chimichanga for half the price at many of the other great Mexican restaurants in South Phoenix. The accompanying rice was also really dry; I think the rice at Poncho's is a lot better.   I also gave the tequila-flavored limeade--I mean, margaritas--another chance, but was still completely disgusted by them. The most amusing part is that after I told the server that I found them to be too limey and sweet last time, he admitted that they mix the margaritas up in advance and that if the server doesn't properly \"stir\" the mix, they can be \"too sweet.\" He then promised me that it would be \"better this time.\" I guess I'm a sucker for ordering one anyway (I guess I had this morbid desire to see if it was really going to be as bad as last time), but shame on Los Dos Molinos for approaching margarita-making like they're serving drinks at a college party.   Finally, the service is totally pretentious for no reason. I understand that this restaurant is very popular, but I don't feel that the owners take much pride in putting out consistently good-quality food and drinks or in being a place where people feel comfortable and want to linger with friends.   Los Dos Molinos must always be so busy because people are lured by the exotic spiciness (and maybe falsely equate spiciness with authenticity), but I have a feeling that discerning restaurant-goers who notice (and care about) the details might not be in love with the place."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place for about 2 years now. The boyfriend wanted to try it and am I happy he did! The food was damn good. The homemade tortillas are great. But be warned all the food we had had a major kick! We loved it, but all might not. 4 stars because it was a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Went at noon on a Saturday, the place was empty. We ordered a ground beef burrito, smothered and a chicken chimichanga, and 2 cokes.the burrito came without any accompaniments like rice or beans. Food was ok, but bill was $38, really? The original bill came back at $70 and had to get the waiter to fix it. Would love to love this place but its ordinary at best and way over priced. Arribas up the street is better quality(hatch green chili) and much better value so I'll go that way next time."}
{"text":"Service was not great.  Sat four of us at a table with 3 chairs.   Ordered a pitcher of margaritas, definitely a mix and not a very good one.  Food was ok but pricey.  Salsa was really hot would have been nice to order a milder version.  Try the one in Mesa years ago remembering that one being good.  Better Mexican places in the area."}
{"text":"The fire factory, as I like to call it, is now open on Sundays for Sunday Funday. It's too bad this location is the only one open on Sundays.   Los Dos Molinos takes spicy to a new level. Some of the dishes here, even for a native of Phoenix, are so hot they are inedible. I've had everything on the menu, multiple times, and my favorites are the Mexican Pizza, Carnitas, Garlic Shrimp, and the Red Beef Burro Enchilada Style. The Jalapeno green salsa is incredible as well.   They serve up some great margaritas, though for the best margs, visit the Washington Street location as they seem to be better at mixing. There is a reason Los Dos has been around for as long as it has, and has received all of it's national press."}
{"text":"Edit: You can't beat a good restaurant within walking distance of your home. You also can't beat the fact that this location doesn't have nearly the waits (if any) of it's southside counterpart. The food is excellent, the service is friendly, and it is spiffy clean. I love the green jalapeno/tomatillo salsa and the red chili burro enchilada style, but that is one spicy meal!  +1 for being close -1 for the firebomb it leaves in your stomach"}
{"text":"This place is not at all like the one on Central Ave, which we have loved for years. We were greeted by one dude, brought drinks by another and waited on by a third, none had much personality and seemed bored to be there. The kick ass margaritas were more like pat on the ass, weak with a mix that tasted vaguely like Sauza mix watered down with some fresh lime squeezed in. We had to order an extra shot to give them some life. The cheese crisp was so-so, I think it was a Mission tortilla, definitely not handmade. The enchaladas had a pepper next to them denoting spicy, but they were not spicy at all, and the chicken was over shredded. The carnitas was flavorless and greasy. Too bad because the south location is such a hike, but we will be headed there next time."}
{"text":"Three words, service, service, service and this place sucks at all three. I mean horrible. Stopped by for drinks and appetizers at the bar - only three other patrons in the whole place and it still took 15 minutes for a beer and margarita. Longer on refills. And there are 4 people just standing around. The Manager, at least that's who I think he was, lose the baseball cap and sunglasses- seriously, this isn't your living room. Owners, wake up and visit your place, this is going to go under."}
{"text":"No stars would be more appropriate.  Garbage on a plate. Sent chili rellano back and got a green chimmie. Both equally bad and disgusting.  Our cheese 'crisp' was a limp cold rag. Fake sour cream and green tasteless stuff they were trying to pass off as guac. Terrible.  Horrible. Terrible. This place has died, they just haven't put it in the dumpster yet. Waste.....of money."}
{"text":"We're all entitled to our own opinion, I guess that's why we yelp!  Los Dos should really get 2.5 stars, it's not bad and it's not great. I knew the food would be hot, I read the other reviews. But, does it really need to be that hot. Kind of seems like they are trying to cover something up.  The service was good it's just the ala carte menu, all of the \"NO\" signs you see throughout the restaurant and the menu. No this, no that just doesn't make for a very customer-friendly experience.  I'm glad I tried it, but we won't be back. It's just nothing special."}
{"text":"I would go to this place JUST for the chips and salsa.  The red and green are both very flavorful and spicy.  This was my first time going to this location and I decided to make the drive for the salsa.  They were at the My Nana's Salsa Challenge, and won, so I decided it was worth the drive.  They did not disappoint..   We ordered a plain cheese crisp, carne adovada burro, and a shredded beef burro.  Somewhat boring choices on our part, but they were really tasty.  The adovada was fantastic.  I could eat that every day, given the opportunity.  And the green salsa was just soooooooo delish!!!!! Service was a bit sketchy.  We were there tonight, on a quiet Sunday, and were \"forgotten\" after we got our food.  But I'd forgive a little bit of sketchy service for a re-do of those chips and salsa!!!"}
{"text":"I love Los Dos Molinos as a go-to for New Mexican cuisine.  Green Chile is HOOOTT!  it's hard to find proper flavourful Green Chile in the Phoenix area - and Los Dos Molinos doesn't disappoint.   At our table we ordered both green and red chile enchiladas, tacos and green chile casserole with an egg over it.  Don't order if you can't handle the heat. But if you enjoy a bit of heat- it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped here pretty late on a Thursday night. Very \"busy\" decorations all oevr the place, but it was pretty original and we liked it. I ordered the carnitas plate and it was VERY tender (which was good) but seemed to be lacking a little flavor (not so good). Our appetizer was good, the servers seemed very busy but they were still pleasant, so overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Your going to have to be drunk to like this food. Yuck!!! The chips and salsa might be the only decent thing here."}
{"text":"MUST TRY THIS PLACE    The ribs adovada are HOT, hottest meal i have ever eaten.   Love this place, great environment, drinks, and food!"}
{"text":"We are regulars.  If you love spicy, you'll love it.  If you love fresh made salsa, you'll love it.  Tonight we asked if they had chipotle and our waiter said they were out.  5 minutes later, a cook brought us a fresh made batch, made just for us ... No way!!!  Yum - dip a chip in that and then in a little guac - yum! Inside needs a little attention, but bathroom is clean.  We love sitting outside. Margarita, anyone?  The Brazilian is worth it.  Skip the rest, they are just ok, but this one is killer and worth it!"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner for the first time at Los Dos.  They need to call this place \"Just Lost\".  House margarita was horrible, water and a little tequila.  Order a beer, margaritas not worth price.  Ordered 2 cheese enchiladas with beef, waited forever, the server came by and asked if we wanted to checkout BEFORE we got our food.  Food was slightly warm, not hot at all, but too hot with spice, way too hot.  The only thing that took longer than to get our food, was waiting to get the bill.  Order was not what I ordered, got soft tacos with machaca, no cheese.  Bill was $42 for two people.  Go next door to Philly's and get the French dip sandwich , way better and cheaper.  I had hopes for this place, since not much choice for Mexican food in Ahwatukee, but will continue to drive to TeePee on Indian School road, it's worth the drive.  Very disappointed with Los Dos on Warner Rd."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in mesa! Good service delicious food and love the spice! they are very generous in the serving and a lot of flavor in everything ! Love chips and salsa (free btw). yes i recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I am a native New Mexican and can say the chili is true Hatch chili, although the red chili was made from the red powder opposed to using dry chili pods, soaking them in water and preparing the sauce, which is how I like it. The service was subpar unfortunately and the price of plate was a bit pricey for the portion you get. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is always a hit for a spicy lunch! I come in every few months and I always leave pleased."}
{"text":"I suppose you could just put me in the \"box\" with \"Luis T\" on 3.20.10...because if i didnt know any better, his could have been my entry.. So i was here this week.  Let me start by saying i have been giving Los Dos Molinos my  business for almost 20 years now, and each year that goes by i find myself saying that i am going to cease my patronage.  I will save the stories from the recent years and why i've been feeling this way, and give you just the specifics from my most recent visit:  If you want to make the rule that there are \"No Split Checks\" then can you AT THE VERY LEAST get with the current times and make the bill somewhat decipherable?  We had a large party, and were quite promptly advised there were no split checks, yet at the end of the night we were left with a ribbon of calculator tape with ONLY prices, and no correlation with actual menu items...so we had to cross reference the menu to figure out what the heck all the itemizations correlated to.   And by the end of it, we pretty much gave up and just guessed at what each person should contribute because the receipt may have just as well been in morse code.  Ok, im getting ahead of myself..Its one thing if you have subpar service and the restaurant is slammed, understaffed, there is a MLB baseball game or NBA basketball game, or concert going on...This was not the case.  We were the ONLY table inside the restaurant and the service absolutely sucked.  How many times must one flag down the server for (take your pick) A;  refill on chips B: refill on ice water and C:(most importantly since the drinks are marked up 300%) a FRESH DRINK!!! Oh yes and D: Check please.  We had to look over our shoulders for A , B, C, and D.  When our table collectively decided the service was ridiculous we decided the tip would reflect that, and then we realized an 18% gratuity was included...well no wonder.  When that is the case, there is NO incentive for decent service!! We brought several items to the attention of the bald headed caucasian man who may have been a manager of some sort but his severe lack of customer service skills merely resulted in him stating in a childish voice \"They are complaining about the service\" to an audience that didnt exist.  Damn right! and damn right we will take our business elsewhere.  Grandma Chavez is rolling in her grave! you should be ashamed!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. I had the beef burrito enchilada style with black beans and rice. The rice had a ton of cheese on it...which was strange. Chips were brought out pretty slowly, and one of the batches was all crumbs. Lots of different salsas though, which were all good. We paid the extra six bucks for the higher level pitcher of tequila and it was bad. Bitter, store bought mix, and barely cold. They did replace it which was nice and appreciated. But I mean, seriously...they have to know those margaritas are bad. My water got refilled. Once. At the beginning of the meal. Being that the service was so slow, I went the entire SECOND hour without water. Dessert came out incredibly slow, then the server acted annoyed that WE had to shuffle dirty plates around to make room. Plates HE should have cleared. The amount of time this meal took and the quality of drinks do do not make this mediocre food worth it. Most likely won't visit again."}
{"text":"The green chile stew is excellent, though not as spicy as I would have liked. The tortillas are good, but dense."}
{"text":"The salsa was great, especially the green. The main course was just okay. Wife's soft tacos were a soggy, nasty mess. My burrito was not bad actually, the chicken was tasty. Rice and beans are BLAND; rice seemed too old, a little crunchy like it was left over from lunch. Overall, not a good place compared to other places in the same price range. I will go here again for the salsa and margaritas, but not the food."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Mexican restaurant. The food is always incredible and so full of flavor. The drinks are wonderful. And the salsa is spicy! I definitely stay hydrated when I eat here. I'm not super sensitive to spicy food (I love spicy food, actually), so if you're not comfortable with hot food, be very careful about what you order. It's not for the weak! You can't go wrong with this place. I'd give it a million stars if I could."}
{"text":"There's not many 5 star places in the valley. LOS DOS MOLINOS is one of them!! The ambience, menu and staff are all authentic. The food / menu is served New Mexico style which is all good... The Chicken Enchilada dinner is hands down the best plate of food West of the Mississippi. I've almost sold my future first born for a plate... Yea, it's that serious.   You will not be disappointed with the chips and salsa. You will not be disappointed by the service. I will personally refund your money if you're not satisfied with the food you get. That's how much I'm confident you'll love this place. Every date I've taken here or every homie that's come with me to eat here has vouched for this place as well.   Thanks to a lovely angel named Noemi who first took me here, I can vouch for it as well."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp we found this authentic Mexican restaurant... We were weary about the wait but it wasn't that bad.  The food came pretty quick - service from the wait staff was great, the hostess not so much.   So first you get some super spicy salsa with chips and already, there is a party in your mouth.  I ordered the Adovado ribs and it was ultra spicy and ultra good, literally melts in  your mouth and my buddy ordered the tacos (just okay)...  and I got a yummie Margarita - it was a night club in mouth and with the noise, seriously could not concentrate...   Very good - will return if we ever go back for Cubs Spring Training..."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Have been a few times since they opened this location and have never been let down. Good is great, service is top notch and I'll be a faithful customer!"}
{"text":"I wish you could taste the food (and margarita) just by reading this. The food never disappoints. The staff are wonderful, but the food remains the star! It is one of those local places that when you discover it, you want to both keep it a secret, yet share with the world because it's so good. Kudos on that raspberry margarita ! 10/10 limes on my \"how good is that margarita\" scale."}
{"text":"Food was OK, atmosphere very authentic Mexican, but the service was terrible.  They seated us and then it look about 10 minutes before anyone came to take a drink order, then about another 10 minutes to get it!  Once we placed the food order, the food came quickly, but overall would never return because of the slow service."}
{"text":"As a regular customer of Los Dos Molinos over the years, I thought I'd give the Ahwatukee location a try even though the Mesa location is closer to home.  Upon arrival, I noticed the happy hour banner draped across the outside of the restaurant that advertised $1 off all drinks from 2-5pm.  My first thought was how disingenuous!  Kinda hard to take advantage of that happy hour when you work 9-5!  Since I was alone I sat at the bar and noticed some margarita glasses filled with pork rinds.  I didn't try one as i thought I'd wait for the chips and salsa.  I sat down and the fedora wearing bartender gave me a rather chilly reception, asked if I wanted a drink (I ordered a draft beer) and then he proceeded to bring me a menu and some chips and salsa.  Upon reviewing the menu I was hit with sticker shock!  I had tried to view their menu on their website but the link says \"menu pending\".  Had I seen the menu prices online I would not have come down here!  maybe it's a way to bait customers into coming in?  The bartender said something to the effect that \"there are some price differences vs. the other locations.\"  Maybe their high prices are due to area demographics?  I ordered the carne adovada burrito which when served \"enchilada xmas (red/green sauce) style\" brought the price to around $15 with NO rice or beans!    While waiting for my order I asked one of the bartender/servers if he could change the channel to the D'backs game and his response was \"in a minute\".  This typifies the service at Los Dos Molinos which has always been subpar.  My order arrived and the food was spicy and tasty though the burrito was on the dry side.  Checkout is performed using an ipad which if you've never used one of these was a little awkward.  The unit I used had a crack on the display which tells me margaritas and ipads don't mix!  $21.06 for a burrito and a beer!!  I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Lol, worst experience we've ever had. $9 margaritas where watered down to the point they where completely see thru, yet super dark green.  It was obviously some sugary pre mixer, were not picky, but these where so bad they were funny, until the stale chips came, then I thought, well they're just ripping people off here. Was a Saturday at 3:30 light, and nobody was in the restaurant, yet our server was never around, and he wouldn't let us sit outside where it was perfect out! Well now we know what crap restaurants look like, lol! Hit up Philly's next door, place rocks."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb for New Mexico style food...it doesn't get any better, and I hope they never close! I come every time when I visit from out of state. That being said, when we visit in larger groups, I feel like the attitude toward us by the wait staff is that we are an inconvenience...sometimes they're not that friendly & it feels like they wish we would leave. Makes me sad! (And we tip great!!)"}
{"text":"Outstanding food with a cool, casual ambiance. There pork ribs are outstanding. So good. Great, fresh Salsa as well. I am coming back for seconds and thirds. Nice patio area for kicking back and convos. Staff are quick and helpful. IF THEY SAY SPICY, they mean it! There is not medium here. It's either hot spicy or not at all."}
{"text":"The best New Mexican cuisine around! We moved from Chicago 2 years ago and went all over Phoenix looking for good Mexican food. The bartender at Garcias told us to come to los dos for flavor and spice. Los dos although New Mexican cuisine has replaced our need to find Mexican food. We love the environment and the family who runs it. They are welcoming, friendly and inclusive. They are like family to us not just a business. Authentic and deliciously spicy!! We love it here, won't spend our money elsewhere. Margaritas here are worth the price unlike chilis or other establishments that serve you crap margaritas iced and watered down and no alcohol. Sandy, Drew, Rena, Pedro you all are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Hostess was snooty & seemed to be bothered to seat us. Server was nice, but seriously not attentive had to keep waving our hands to try to get a refill. It was not even busy.  The food was a small portion for that price $14.95 each plate. It was just super hot could not even taste any seasonings.  Just had a burning mouth. Couldn't believe that we were charged $1.50 per tortilla.  You only get 1 tortilla with the meal.  Server should of mention the extra fee per tortilla. Will not go there again!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here recently for the first time and I am definitely a fan.  We came in looking for the prickly pear margarita, but unfortunately they were out at the time.  So we tried a couple other libations instead which were equally as tasty.  We tried the machaca and relleno and they were both delicious.  They had great salsa as well for the chips that you get when you sit down.    I have no doubt that we will stop in here again when in the area.  If you haven't been and love Mexican food, give it a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"For anyone who is a fan of Mexican food- you must try Los Dos Molinos.  I LOVE spicy food, and it's hard for me to find a place that has salsa that is spicy enough for my taste buds...  that is until I found this amazing place.  Their salsa is not for the faint of heart- so beware- also no free refills on the salsa, but it's worth paying extra for, in my opinion.  The margaritas are yummy- they don't douse it in sweet and sour mix and lime juice.  Service is not great but not horrible either. I just go for the food- which is what restaurants should be about anyways."}
{"text":"Ignore all the negative reviews here. They are  ABSOLUTELY NOT rating the food.  There is no way there is any justification to rate this place less that a solid 5 star if you are rating the food.  I just had the Chile Relleno burrito and it was fantastic!  I was completely shocked by the PRESENTATION and SIZE of this burrito and then, when I got a taste of it, WOW!  AMAZING!  If you are a green chili lover, you will LOVE IT here!  The red chili is also great but in my opinion, doesn't compare to the green (but I love it hot).  Go for the red if you want something less hot.  The service is really great if you like to actually sit down to eat and not feel rushed to get out.  That is what I really love about dining here. Great food and no rush to get you out.  Love it and recommend it."}
{"text":"The Adovada Burrito was absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!!  The Garlic Shrimp was listed as a \"House Specialty\" and I don't know why?  The shrimp tasted just boiled and plopped on some wet rice with green sauce and cheese.  I didn't like it.  The Adavada Ribs were also listed as a \"House Specialty.\"  I can actually see why this was added as a \"House Specialty\" however, my plate came with a glob of fat that I bit into thinking it was pork and it grossed me out but it was otherwise fantastic.  The Adovada  Burrito was the best dish hands down!  The Advada Ribs came with a corn tortilla and it was amazing (obviously homemade and the best that I have ever had) however, I would have preferred a  flour tortilla.  The menu just said it came with a tortilla and the waitress did not ask if I wanted flour or corn.  The chips were cold and mostly crumbs but the red and green salsa were AMAZING!!  The beans were pinto beans with the broth (which I prefer over refried). When we were finished eating, we were offered a \"To Go\" and I accepted however, they brought me out a Styrofoam plate with some flimsy foil to cover it.  NO WAY can I transport that in my car with runny beans and runny sauce. Seriously??  I then said \"no I can't take it with me\".  Then I noticed that they had orders \"To Go\" for pick up and they are in regular \"take out\" boxes so I asked for one and they did provide one but REALLY???  Why should I have to ask??"}
{"text":"My all-time favorite New Mexico style Mexican food with the best Hatch chilies I've ever had."}
{"text":"Warning: If you are a baby about spicy food dont go there then write a lame review because you wanted to try something else besides Boston Market or JB's for once. This is not the place for your bland taste buds, move on.  Most people that have been to Los Dos on Central, Camelback, or Mesa know what to expect, sometimes good but sometimes sub par service but great green chili pork most of the time. What I have found with the location in Chandler is that they have great service every time and are the most consistent on the green sauce being spicy and actually have good rice unlike the others which have hard bland rice but good beans.   My first interactions had me wanting to write of the Los Dos on Central. I had tried the tacos(they were in corn shells like taco bell yuck), the red chili( crazy hot but not in a tasty way) but it wasnt until I got what my friends were getting that I got the allure. The green chili pork in platter or burro form was amazingly good and I have been hooked since.    I see some of the reviews here and it makes my blood boil because I know the dorks that leave dismayed wrote a check their tongue couldn't cash as the area is predominately white and the surrounding mexican restaurants suck a big one(that is, the ones that manage to stay open). I live in central Phoenix and I make the trip there passing dozens of terrible mexican food along the way. The only thing wrong with this place is that it's location is in the middle of Blandsville, AZ and critiqued by people with no barometer for good food."}
{"text":"Prickly Pear Margarita is out of this world. Take an uber home if your drinking here :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here, as she came here years ago and said it was alright. A lot of commentators are saying the food is really spicy. It's okay. The chili is watered down and the food is very very bland. I've had authentic New Mexican before in New Mexico, and this restaurant...at least at this Mesa location, is definitely not it!! While the bartender/bus boy was nice, the waitress was a real pos. Just horrible service, horrible attitude towards my girlfriend and I. Not sure why either.   So if you want to enjoy a night of eating bland mexican food while being insulted by a hostile and confrontational waiter....stop on by! :)"}
{"text":"After being banished 3 1/2 years ago to Oklahoma, I made a return trip to Phoenix recently and had to go here. As you can imagine, the Southwestern/Mexican food anywhere in Oklahoma is... how do I put it? Best not eaten. So I gorged myself on Mexican while in town. I stopped in at Los Dos Molinos for lunch and the atmosphere alone made me feel more comfortable. They brought me the staple tortilla chips and salsa. I don't know that I can actually call it salsa though... it was more like an art: a palatable aesthetic. I had a problem here, in that I had so many restaurants to hit up while in town and only so much room in my stomach. Sadly, that meant I needed something to satiate my appetite and craving, so I opted for a simple bean burrito. It had a good blend of seasoning, plus a nice mix of refried and whole pinto beans. I ended up using all the salsa by dousing my burrito with it. The only downside to the place is the tight parking behind the restaurant, but all in all it was a great experience."}
{"text":"los dos molinos is like an acid trip. no, i've never actually been on acid, but it's kinda what i imagine it would be like.   the first thing i liked about LDM.... it's not located in some strip mall or random parking lot. it's out in the boonies, man. as my brother drove us all out there, i kept thinking, where the hell are we going?  we got there and i was immediately giggly. it looked like a crazy person decorated it, and i love crazy people. there is no rhyme or reason to the interior design scheme, it's all over the place. for some reason though, it made me happy. the patio looked so inviting, but with the weather topping out at about 118 degrees that day, we decided inside was best.   we walk in and there's no one around. no one. we actually started wandering around in their back kitchen and offices just to find someone.(it was very clean BTW) it was odd that the place seemed so deserted even though they had just opened. it felt weird no one was around to greet us. so we forged on.  finally, someone showed up and seated us. then, like some moon beam shining upon the masses, the crowd started parading in. we ordered one of their pitchers of sangria with an abundance of pretty fruit floating in it. we poured over the menu discussing our options like our lives depended on it. as someone who makes their own homemade sangria, i was especially impressed with their recipe. oh so good, and so refreshing.  next we all ordered. i got the carnitas dinner, the rest of our group ordered the relleno dinner, the tamales, the enchiladas. the carnitas were cooked exactly how i love..... juicy, but crispy on the outside. the rest of my dining companions chowed down like horny sailors at a whore house. one of those meals where there is more eating than chatting.   as the dinner winded down, we ordered margaritas for dessert. i don't remember too much after that 5th margarita, but let me tell you, it was f'ing FANTASTIC!  los dos molinos means the \"two grinders\" (chili grinders) in spanish. but i don't really care, i just want to go eat their food and drink their tequila.  acudir de inmediato! los dos molinos.... te amo con todo mi corazon!"}
{"text":"The best Fire Hot \"New Mexican\" style in the state.   Do Not go there if you don't like Hot food, you will not like it.   If you like Quality, Spicy Hot family recipes you will love it!!  Great top shelf Margaritas as well."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! We've never had anything bad at Los Dos and they really bring the heat. The reason for my two star review is service. We've been going to this location (even at the previous spot) for many years and service has always been slow and not very friendly. Recently we called for take out and were told they no longer take orders after 5pm. I don't know if it's because their kitchen can't handle the volume or if they are trying to get people in the restaurant to boost alcohol sales or service tips, but I found it very odd. We have small children who are in bed by 6pm, so we don't go out to dinner very often, so take out is a great solution for the restaurants we love. Unfortunately, this isn't going to get us in the restaurant more, just loose our business."}
{"text":"Sheryl the owner was the best hosts. I felt welcomed and was acknowledge as soon as I walked in the door. I would definitely recommend this place great service and their salsa is"}
{"text":"This place is more than decent for those of us who lived in New Mexico and are looking for our food in Arizona. Even the strange architecture and decor remind me of something you might find in Albuquerque. The salsa was pretty great, but the chips seemed a bit stale and unimpressive. I'd love to see them revamp the chips to something fresh and warm to set the stage for their above average food. Service has always been ok, too. Go to Los Dos if you want pretty good food with a decent amount of spice and flavor in a unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was expecting this place to be amazing after hearing people rave about this place.  Maybe the other locations are better.  Service was horrible.  Waiter was rude when we asked if they had a children's menu.  Very obvious that they are frequently asked this question.  One would think it wouldnt be too difficult to come up with one.  We sat outside and the cement bench with no back was horribly uncomfortable.  Salsa was below average as well as food.  I ordered tacos and the tortilla was soaked in some type of grease which dripped off as I ate it.  I absolutley LOVE Mexican food.  My in laws are from Mexico and we have authentic Mexican food whenever possible, this place is a poor excuse for Mexican food.  Hopefully it has improved since we have been there."}
{"text":"Never written a review for Yelp, but definitely felt compelled to do so. This place is THE BEES KNEES. No joke. Their \"kick ass margarita\", is that exactly. Im from Albuquerque, NM and Im totally grateful that there is a place in the valley that serves up chile that makes my nose run because it is so spicy. The service here is incredible too!! Live music and Wed/Sat nights can definitely provide more than your dollar's worth. You will not be disappointed if you visit here, and if you are, you have no idea what true \"New Mexican\" is about."}
{"text":"Spicy and flavorful! Loved the green salsa. I recommend the Carne adovada and house Margarita. My mom loved the corn tortillas with her garlic shrimp dinner. She loved the sangria and the shrimp garlic dish was not spicy and very yummy. Beans are very yummy too!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, long-tenured employees. We are treated like family (royalty? Can't decide...) We love you @losdosmesa   Whether dropping in for a quick meal or takeout, bringing out of town guests to hang out for a while, or having a large (!) party in the reception room, it's _all_ good!"}
{"text":"Food was soooooo salty.  Good chips and salsa and a great energy in the place.  Service was good too.  Food was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Great Margarita!!!! Great Bartender!!!! Great food too!!! These people really know how to take care of their guests. Ask for Chris if you get there!!!!!"}
{"text":"This by far is the BEST Mexican restaurant!!! We travel 30 miles from North Scottsdale at least twice a week!    If you want authentic fresh New Mexico food...DO not miss this GEM. All locations in the valley are family owned and YOU can tell!!! The service is always terrific! We have been coming to the restaurant for several years now and the staff is attentive and wants to please. The lack of attrition of staff which says EVERYTHING you need to know, servers with Los Dos have been there over 20+ years.... Kudos to everyone who makes us feel very special when we are there including: Drew, Reina, \"Their Family Aunt\", Chris, Jorge, Bernie and everyone else! When you drive close to thirty miles each way at least twice a week should say everything you need to know. AND don't forget to order the FRESH Margaritas - the best!!! Thank you Reina!!!   Beyond the staff.. Lets talk food!!!   We are foodies and have been blessed to dine from Manhattan to around the world. When we come back home from our travels we CAN NOT wait to go to our favorite place! We love spice and Los Dos knows how to deliver. Its spicy and yummy, but its NOT just HOT, you can taste the flavor of the food. The salsas are AMAZING!   Don't miss out on the following:  -- Carne Adovada  -- Green Chicken Enchilada  -- Garlic Pork anything!!!  -- Tostados are delicious (hint: add an egg on top!)   Dessert: Wowowow!!  -- Sopapillas   Drinks:  -- Again Fresh Margarita!!    As stated we are foodies and appreciate: TERRIFIC, FRESH and QUALITY food.  THEY will not let you down...the other reviewers that have provided poor reviews.  DON'T let that stop you from enjoying the BEST food in the Valley!  All the best to LOS DOS and we CAN's wait to be there tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about how great and authentic Los Dos Molinos is. I finally gave it a try and maybe my expectations were too high because I wasn't impressed. I grew up near Mexico and even lived there for a short while, so I have a pretty discerning taste for Mexican food.   Mexican food does not only equal spicy. Sure, spicy flavors are a common part of Mexican foods, but there are so many other delicious flavors involved. I felt that if Los Dos took out the \"heat\", there'd be nothing but bland food remaining. I can handle spice, but give me some flavor in my food!   Also, the margaritas were not very good. They tasted like they were straight from a really cheap margarita mix.   Yes, we did have good laugh over several of the people at our table who broke a sweat while they were eating, but would I call the food and flavors delicious? Definitely not. The restaurant has a festive decor and is perhaps a good place to take out-of-towners to laugh at them while they eat spicy food, but if you're looking for  flavorful Mexican food, I wouldn't recommend Los Dos."}
{"text":"This place used to be Padres. Padres had great food and great service. We waited over 20 minutes for anyone to come to our table. Never made it to the food. We left starving. I miss Padres! :("}
{"text":"The best New Mexico food I've had outside the 505. The red salsa is good and spicy but the green salsa is SPICY! The carne adovada relleno and chimichange were excellent topped with their green chile sauce.  Service is a little on the slow side but also very polite. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and bar if you like spicy food!"}
{"text":"Just moved to this side of the valley. Wanted to try something new.  First mistake.  The restaurant setting fun...lots of stuff on walls and ceiling...and good music playing. That's where it goes downhill from. We were poorly greeted and sat at a table.  The waiter came by and was taking our order and I asked if they had a milder salsa than what was given with the chips when we sat down. He looked at me and said..\" we don't got no mild \"....with a very condescending tone and look. Every thing we asked for we had to ask for 2 or 3 times.  After ordering it took 35 minutes for the food to arrive. We told him the food my wife ordered was too spicy and he laughed and said \" ha...spicy enough?\" The food was very bland on my plate, I got the ground beef Grand Burrito and it was a tortilla and meat.....nothing else. When done we had to ask for the check 2 times and then it took 10 minutes to get it back. I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets for Mexican food. And the Brazilian Margarita is to die for!"}
{"text":"I have heard such great things, but the actual event was so lack luster. It look an hour to get our order, I won't even mention how long it took for the waitress to take our order. The place wasn't even half full so I would hate to see if when they are busy.  When the food came out, half the orders were wrong. The portions were odd and very light on any meat. The salas were both too spicy to be eaten with the chips which I think were three days old. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"I hardly ever give 5 stars, but this place definitely deserves it! I just had the best Mexican food at this joint and it was spicy as hell. We had no clue this place cooked everything super spicy, but that's exactly how I love my food so I was super duper happy. They bring you chips and 2 different salsas to start (red chili and salsa verde) and they are both spicy with chunks of chili peppers in them. We told the manager how much we loved the salsas and he went on to tell us how everything they make is from scratch, including the tortillas. I ordered the taco and red chili cheese enchilada platter with rice and beans. I'm a hard critic when it comes to enchiladas and they are super authentic and delicious here! Be warned though: the beans and the red chili sauce are really really really spicy! I wasn't expecting that kind of heat in the beans and I'm definitely paying for it right now as I type, but it was sooooo worth it. I'm a true fan and will definitely return very soon!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, albeit spicy. The Kick-Ass Margaritas pack a whollop!   A few weeks ago we went there and it was a great experience. Reese was our waiter and he was attentive and friendly. I gave that visit a 5 star rating.   However, last night was horrible and I'm pissed we spent $80 for two of us. We sat on the patio (because the live music inside was awful and too loud). They sat us on one side of the patio that was so dark I had to use my phone to light the menu and to see my meal. And the fun began- immediately adjacent to the patio there was a crew using a loud pressure washer to clean the kitchen floor mats. That lasted the entire time we were eating our meal. We had to yell over the motor noise. We told the waiter (as did other patrons) how obnoxious the noise was but there was nothing done to stop it.   I agree with other reviewers- the iPad payment system is awkward and tacky.  Overall: Good food- if you like spicy- but get it to go. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. A Mexican restaurant I can take my in-laws from New Mexico to without embarrassment. Yes, Los Dos Molinos does bring the heat, but they assist you by spice indications on the menu and by friendly help when ordering. My advice? Embrace the heat. Rules of thumb? The red salsa is hot. The green salsa is not. The green sauce is hot. The red sauce is not. I hope that's clear :) Better ask your server if you're truly adverse to spicy food.  I love the New Mexico influences: The random fried eggs. The quality red and green chile smothering every burrito and enchilada. The heat.     The kids menu is great, with a lot of choices. Some items seem a little expensive at first reading, but they are worth the price.   The restaurant itself is bright and colorful, but basic. A true hole in the wall. I drove right by it the first time I visited. It's easy to see in the daylight, but it's difficult to spot at night. Just trust Google if you're arriving after dark. The prices are very reasonable and the service is very friendly and attentive.   A bonus: There's a Yelp deal for a free cheese crisp as of this date."}
{"text":"I hardly ever just give one star as I'm a silver lining type of gal, but there was none to be found here.  I don't know what kind of Mexican food this is, or what you all consider Mexican, but this was not for me.  Started with the chips and salsa, which were pretty flavorless and should have been a red flag.  I ordered the enchilada plate with an egg on top.  What I got is not what I have ever seen an enchilada look or taste like.  It was like a layer of fried cornmeal, some shredded beef, no wait, a pile a shredded beef, and some chile sauce that I wound not classify as red chile.  I tired really hard to suck it up and give it a try, but it only got less and less appetizing.  Then we ordered the sopaipillas and they were just meh, not worth the calories.  The waitress was not very friendly and I can't believe I spent $45 to feel physically sick.  Will not be going back....ever."}
{"text":"Adovada Ribs need I say anymore?    Great flavor good heat and they are even pulled off the bone for your convenience.    I love hot food so Los Dos is a great spot for me.  I know it's not authentic Mexican but they just really do things right for spice lovers."}
{"text":"My mom is visiting from Alaska and she is a huge fan of Los Dos Molinos so it was a must that we went there to eat.  I love spicy food so I do enjoy this place, but on this visit the harsh reality sunk in that this place is really just average.  Food is good and service is fine but nothing to really make me crave going back again and again.    I always get the adovado ribs which are a bit spicy but good.  I also enjoy their green salsa that comes out with chips as it has some good heat to it.    Overall it's A-OK New Mexican food but I think the novalty has worn off for me now."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for a while, finally got to try it out on Saturday for dinner.  We got there around 5 and got right in, but by the time we left there was a 20-30 minute wait, so get there early.  It was cold and rainy so we sat inside, but it has a huge patio that would be pretty nice on a warm sunny day.  I got a special recommended by the server which was a chile relleno with carne adovada, and a green corn tamale on the side.  Both were pretty awesome, the pork is super tender and melts in your mouth, and the chile was coated with egg batter, cheese and green chile sauce, tasty.  The tamale was soft and simple, just how they should be, again covered with the chile sauce and cheese.  My wife had the chicken enchiladas with blue corn tortillas in red sauce, topped with fried egg.  Never seen the egg on top before but it was really good, break the yolk and let it become part of the sauce.  The beans were pretty good and the rice has a good bite to it as well.      I also had a couple of margaritas, nothing special but plentiful, giant glasses.  The food defiantely had a little spice to it but nothing like i had expected after hearing everyone talk about it.  Maybe i just have a high tolerance for chiles.      The decor was pretty interesting as well.  Tons of chotchkies all over the walls and hanging from the ceiling.  There were actually two molinos though.  Cool place, lots of color and stuff to keep your eyes busy.   All in all, great meal, good service, and entertaining environment. I will be back."}
{"text":"Los is one of our favorite places to go - we even held our rehearsal dinner for our wedding there. Los is authentic and fun, with friendly staff. You can't find better (or hotter) New Mexican food in Arizona."}
{"text":"Just ate lunch and fell in love with this place all over again. I haven't been to the one on Central in years and decide to try this one for lunch. It started with me thinking I found the best chips and salsa in town. Then the waiter suggested I try the green chile stew. OMG. It is the best ever. Be prepared for some spicy hot food. Everything was hot but not so hot it took away from the flavor."}
{"text":"UPDATE: So after reading reviews on this place I think some clarity should be fleshed out. First off, this is NEW MEXICAN cuisine, not Mexican. The chilies are different (Chipotle, pasilla, ancho versus Hatch), the burn and spicy level is different (Mexican is more smokey whereas New Mexican is hot), technique is different (Mexican burritos are to be eaten with your hands whereas New Mexican burritos are eaten with a fork and knife, refried beans versus whole pinto), and so is execution (the way the food is actually cook and prepared). As much as someone wants to review this establishment as Mexican and critique it for falling short needs to accept Los Dos Molinos for what it is: authentic New Mexican food with its own history and cultural specificity. If one visits Albuquerque, Taos, or Santa Fe this is the cuisine that they will find. With that said, it's the best New Mexican place in The Valley. It truly does transport you to the New Mexican high desert.   ORIGINAL: This place is the real deal. If you like spicy food then this is where you want to be. Chips come with two salsas; red and green. The green has more texture to it and is extremely spicy and the red is a bit more viscous and not quite as spicy; but both are good. I had the adovada burrito which was outstanding. The flour tortilla was quite thick, thicker than normal, and had a good taste. Meat was super tender and seasoned well. Christmas sauce spicy level was 7/10 and provided a good burn for a while after. Beans and rice were good, too. Ambiance was pretty interesting as well. Anyplace that had sopapillas and empanadas is bound to be good."}
{"text":"Best. Mexican. In. Phoenix.  Having grown up in LA, I've had a lot of Mexican food. I was impressed with Phoenix's abundant Mexican offerings, but none stood out as spectacular (excepting Barrio Cafe, which I don't consider a traditional \"Mexican Restaurant\"). I was advised by nearly everyone I asked to go check out Dos Molinos, so I did, and it was good... fiery good.  And I don't mean that metaphorically - Dos Molinos is the kind of place that doesn't ask you \"how spicy?\" They just bring you your dish, and it's unabashedly spicy, the way it was meant to be, and I can't imagine they could consider doing it any other way.  All of us were spicy veterans - having all ordered the *level 10 spice level* at [insert any ethnic restaurant name here], and we were all sweating. Bullets.   I had the Red Chili Enchilada combo plate, and the enchilada's were fantastic. It was the THICK handmade corn tortillas, combined with the shamelessly spicy red chili sauce on top. All the sides were terrific (the beans had a kick of their own).  Their margarita was also pretty ridiculously large, and tasty.   Dos Molinos is my go-to Mexican joint in Phoenix now."}
{"text":"Spicy. Really Spicy. If you enjoy heat, this is your place.  Went with friends that enjoy burn your face of heat. Me, not so much. I couldn't even touch my enchilada it was so flippin SPICY. Obviously I'm a total wimp and I've accepted it.  Chips were really tasty but again, I couldn't touch the salsa. Service was spectacular and food came out FAST. The guys ate my enchilada and called me a big baby and I drank margaritas, it was a win, win :) Cheers!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Los Dos Molinos a few years ago on a whim, unsure if I could handle the spicy food they advertised.  To put it simply, I loved the food and I kept coming back.  Before I touch on the food, I want to give credit to the staff.  I've seen the same group of  people working there for a couple years.  They are friendly and do a good job managing an often busy dinner hour.  The service can be a little slow if they are really hopping, but instead of worrying about it I enjoy the chips and salsa and relax, knowing that a superb meal will be coming my way.  The kitchen is small and there may be a wait on your food, but trust me it is worth it!  About the food - my favorite dish is the \"Special G\" Adovada Burrito with red chili.  It's a delicious pork burrito smothered in cheese and red chili (my personal choice).  The red chili is always spicy, but it can vary quite a bit depending on the batch of chilis that were used.    The frozen margaritas are superbly smooth and pack a pretty good punch.  My favorite is the prickly pear flavor - give it a try if you haven't before, it is quite good!  So, do you like spicy good?  If so, I'd highly recommend giving Los Dos a try.  Good food, good drink, friendly staff, all from a family owned businesses.  What's not to love about that?"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican restaurant in the area, and among the best I've ever had.   Lets start with the 500 lb elephant in the room.  Their food is spicy, very spicy.  You've been warned.  But know this.  The heat does not overwhelm the other flavors in their dishes.  The heat comes from the green chilis they bring in fresh from New Mexico and roast in house.   So it's not simply painful, acidic, or without depth of flavor.  No one complained of a stomach ache afterwards.  And the staff was happy to whip up some mild off-menu quesadillas for the kids. A toddler with us devoured a side of black beans without any complaint.   Brent, our server, guided us through the menu with the skill and knowledge of a master sommelier.  His passion showed.  So responsive. He was bending over backwards to make sure we had a great experience.  It was a quality of service I've never seen outside of a five star restaurant.  The food.  Amazing.  I got the New Mexican green chili stew.  Rich and flavorful with ample servings of meat and potatoes.  Perfectly spiced.  The heat forced me to slow down and savor the dish.  I'm thankful for it.  My wife got the adovada ribs.  Expertly braised, fall-off-the-bone, meaty, and served with the freshest corn tortilla.  The guacamole was fantastic.  Fresh and creamy, not spicy at all."}
{"text":"Sarah H talked me into giving it another try and I can't say it's a lot better. Some aspects were good, others weren't.   Me met for lunch on a Thursday and sat on the patio. It was a good 25 minutes before anyone came to take our order and that was only after requesting our waiter come so we can order.   We started with the queso which was good but there was a lot of beans in it, which I like, but I felt they got in the way of the queso. I would have liked less or no beans and much more queso. I didn't care for the pastry crisp chip thingamajigs it came with so I just used the chips the salsa came with for dipping - problem solved.   Another long wait later our lunch arrived. I originally wanted the chile relleno but was told it was served unseeded, I think to make it spicier but the seeds aren't nice to eat - really pretty gross (trust me, I've made them and missed some seeds and getting a mouthful is no fun) so I don't know why they'd do that. There are better ways to make it spicy and at the same time keep it palatable. Anyway, I settled for the carnitas which the waiter recommended. It looked good and I made up a bite in their tortillas which are extra thick and look hand made. What I mistook for onions turned out to be fat. My carnitas were more than half fat. I know I sound like a complainer and a picky eater, but I'm really not, I just can't eat gooey jiggly fat. I moved off most of it to the side and it really was half the carnitas and gave it a try again. It was ok. It tasted like bland, cooked pork. I've had carnitas all over Mexico, in Mexican restaurants here in the states and have cooked them myself and these were by far the most bland I've had. The pork was moist and tender but had no added flavor. The beans were ok, nothing special and the rice was dried out and crunchy with cheese melted on it. The highlight of the meal was the tortillas which were dense, very thick and very, very salty lending some flavor to the pork.   Again when it was time to leave it was difficult to get our waiters attention to get our check. When he was present he was very polite and attentive but our table was an afterthought. My initial impression of Los Dos stands and I think I'm good for at least another ten years."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Mexican food in town. My family has cooked with heat my entire life. I'm used to that kick in the tongue. I can't go anywhere else and get the spice levels HOT like I can at Los Dos. That along side the massive flavors, from the salsa to the entrees, you just cant beat it! Fantastic place for margaritas as well. I'm super happy about the happy hour priced margarita with the purchase of their goblet. Heck to the yes! I forgot to mention their staff. Great people, including the owner. Feels like family.  #ILoveLosDos"}
{"text":"Moving to Phoenix from New Mexico has left my family jonesing for some real authentic Mexican food with great flavor and heat. I felt like I was back in Santa Fe when visiting this location of LDM. When I visted the one down the street from my house in Ahwatukee I was impressed by the service, but not the food. Our friends told us to try the one on the other side of South Mountain. I took family visiting for the holiday and they were all very happy with the food, service, and ambience. We enjoyed the salsa and chicken enchiladas plater. The pumpkin flan was so amazing we ordered a second one ;)."}
{"text":"Fun place, decent food, great atmosphere.  One of the few places where I don't mind waiting for a table.  The courtyard and margaritas create a fun environment.  The food is good, but slightly overrated. For quasi-New Mexican cuisine, I'd venture to say that Richardson's/Dick's might be better.  The location is Manhattan is also fun and the food stands out there much more than it does here. Visiting Los Dos when I lived in NYC always helped stave off homesickness."}
{"text":"I just landed a new job out in Mesa so I've been exploring the food in the area. I was craving Mexican. This place has great reviews and there's another location that is supposed to be good as well but I was very disappointed. I got the chicken fundito to go. I got a very very small scoop of rice and beans in the separated to go box, should've taken a pic. There was no sour cream like fundito should have. My burrito was soggy and not deep fried. Wasn't soggy from being taken to go, my work is less than 10 mins up the road. Everything was very bland tasting and I paid $14 for it. I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"If I'm going to have New Mexican food this is the place.  Had a very good green chili stew, the carne adovado enchilada, and the  large adovado pork ribs, and a nice margarita to cool things down."}
{"text":"The new location on Chandler Blvd is not very good. We've only eaten there once in April and will wait another 2-3 months (if it's still in business) and give it one more chance. The others I ate at on Central Ave, and Washington St were always very good.  The new reataurant had crummy service, and mediocre food. The tables were dirty when we sat down and the salsa was old, dried out, and we had to ask for fresh salsa. It was also hard to get a glass of water  The food was very BLAND and not worth even discussing. No taste, or anything mentionalble. Is it that hard to mess up tostadas and tamales? Apparently so.. It took 30 minutes to get the check after pleading numerous times.. The place was well staffed so that can't be used as an excuse..  Go across the street to Secreto for good south western food.. This location will fold if it remains this bad"}
{"text":"THis is my all time favorite restaurant. I used to live 10 minutes away and ate there all of the time The food is super spicy.. spicier then I have ever had anywhere else. Fresh and service has always been great. DEFINITELY not for people who do not like it spicy!  The blue corn open face enchiladas with the egg on top is what my dreams are made of!  Awesome place.."}
{"text":"I'm reading all the reviews below and there seems to be a common theme of \"maybe I went on a bad day.\" I went on Cinco De Mayo - the day of all days - and yes, I would say they've been having a bad century.  Coming here was a whirlwind. By that, I mean a hot mess of hair-raising customer service, questionable health code violations, and non-existent communication that not even Alexander Bell or a Code Talker could help out with.  Even though there were a couple of people working, there was one guy who made it a priority that he would be the main server for everyone on this glorious day. I'm pretty sure he decided that his main role was to look pretty, take orders,leave the rest to his lackeys, and do a superb job of ignoring any of the big parties like the plague. I would bet my left kidney that he's the same guy everyone is mentioning in other reviews. Because of this, no one received the right plate they ordered. A majority of our orders actually went to another party's table and not even a 'no, that's not my order' from the other party was obvious enough for them as they just left the plates and went back. It literally didn't even make sense as the other party had just put their order in yet the workers were insistent that it was their order. Unless David Copperfield suddenly decided to get a part-time job cooking mole and beans, not a fat chance.   Our plates were sitting on their table for a good 5 minutes before the employees picked it up and put it on our table, which is totally unacceptable. We told them that and it fell on deaf ears. They claimed it was fine and for those who were more insistent, they picked up the plate and magically came back out within a minute with what they claimed was a 'new plate.' They must really think Copperfield is back there.   I had a quesadilla and the beef was pre-cooked and cold on top of the cheese they melted. My co-worker was forced to eat a burrito with both red and green sauce even though he specifically asked for it another way because they didn't feel like it was important to take it back and make another one. The other 7 at my table picked at the food that was now lukewarm and had been picked at by the other party. If a bystander saw us, they would have probably thought we were eating our last meal, laced with a combination of laxatives and flame retardant.   Know some hot shot who claims to have the utmost self-control? Put a bowl of chips and salsa in front of them. Los Dos Molinos will take it up a notch though and make sure you have no water to drink your entire meal. We didn't even get the chance to order drinks - that's how bad it was. They just forced a pitcher of water on us with no refills. As a party of 8, we stared and contemplated if this is what it was like to be on Survivor. Do we eat the chips and drink more water than we need from the saltiness or save everyone else and share the water?!  In the end, we got a hold of the elusive server who magically appeared at the end of our lunch and told him what a trainwreck everything was. His answer? We decided to come on Cinco De Mayo so we should have expected something to this degree as a large party. Well, thanks for telling us that when we made the reservations a week ahead and you happily accepted. Yes, I expected a little delay and some mishaps on a Mexican holiday at a Mexican restaurant, but I wasn't expecting Chernobyl to happen either.   I literally cannot wrap my head around that ridiculous excuse. It seemed like a perfectly acceptable explanation to him though, so maybe I should start using it around my family every time I inexplicably fail at life. Seems legit. I reckon that if you came here by yourself, you'd be fine. Bring another person with you and you both would be left out in the open to fend for yourselves."}
{"text":"I just didn't really \"get\" this place. The service was really good but I ordered a chicken taco and a bean and cheese burrito and they both had zero flavor or spice. I must have ordered the wrong things"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves New Mexico-style Mexican food that is filling and delicious. The restaurant is family-run and friendly. Their homemade thick-style tortillas are AMAZING. We are never disappointed here."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks.  Music in the bar could improve significantly. When I asked to change it - they said \"no, owners choice.\"  Bottom line, music always feels out of place and could be either Mexican influenced or more modern rock or alternative."}
{"text":"Meh...  Been here 3 times now and I am less impressed with the place each time. This time was the usual Margaritas (always good - but just some house pre-mix so they cant really screw it up), along with some Orange Blossom??? draft beers that are surprisingly tasty, but seem to be lacking in alcohol content.  We ordered chicken soft tacos (which were a small corn shell instead of the expected flour). I thought they were very bland in comparison to the red and green salsas they supplied with the complementary chips. We also ordered the grande burrito (deep fried). The only thing \"grande\" about it was the price. It, too, was very bland IMO (or maybe my taste-buds were just still on vacation after being burnt by the red salsa???). Either way, the size made it nowhere near worth the $12 asking price.  One thing that was somewhat disturbing- we ordered our food and it literally arrived like 1-2 minutes later. WTF? She said they put our order in front of a larger table.  OK? Now for the disturbing part- This must mean that every time I go for mexican food, all they do is make me wait 10-15 minutes for my food, when in reality, this is just so that I think that they are actually cooking something? Good to know.  The service started out attentive, but since one of us is a chips and salsa junkie (not me) they seemed to start ignoring our flag downs for more chips on the 3rd request. I figured since the tiny tacos and burrito they presented did not satisfy, maybe that was why we were still hungry after finishing our orders? Either way, Management listen up... don't be stingy with your tiny bowls of chips and salsas!  On the plus side- The one thing I do like about this location is the atmosphere, but since we only end up here due to the BMW dealer being nearby, here's hoping the car will not need any services for a long while."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Phoenix I dream about eating here!  There's no way I could possibly not eat here on a trip without regrets!   We stopped in for a lunch before hitting another leg on our journey cross country.  We got a nice little sunny spot on the patio in January ( highly recommend visiting Phoenix in January ) .  The guy that seated us looked rather old school Arizonan, with mustache and a little Old West -- very hospitable yet fun to talk to.   I told him him I didn't want to get sunburn, and he assured me no chance on the gringo index for that today.  He was right.   We ordered our drinks first.  Though I so wanted a Margarita or cold beer to go with the food, we could not really drink for our drive.  He suggested superior alternatives.  I had coffee in a french press that was mild enough to compliment the flavors of the hot food, not too bitter and it didn't require any sugar.  My mom had lemonade, and he added a touch of orange that was so good, I drank a good amount of it (glass was huge -- yippee more for me too!)  The food -- well I already knew how GOOD it was from my previous visit so  I was happy to share the experience with my mom.  We had the queso dip that was to die for...my mom said it was the best she ever had and she's in her late 60's.  Then we had tacos.  My mom had chicken so it was mild enough for her, while I ventured for the adovado - very hot pork melted heat yumminess !  The great effect of eating such hot food is it cools off your body temperature, so you feel like it's 10 degrees cooler.  On this day we didn't need it, but most often in Phoenix you do.  MMMmmm just thinking about that HOT yumminess makes my mouth water..  I highly recommend trying out some yummy HOTNESS anytime you're in town!  One thing to note - my first visit to Los Dos Molinos was in the late 90's when I lived here, though not at this location.  I did confirm this was a family-owned business, related to the other location."}
{"text":"Ok. Let's start here:  Los Dos Molinos' specialties are New Mexican dishes.  New Mexican, as in \"from the state of New Mexico.\"  Heavy on the chiles, fairly spicy, and very flavorful.  Really good stuff!  But, if you go expecting Mexican food (whatever \"Mexican food\" means to you), you'll probably leave disappointed.  The carne adovada is what we (I) always go back for.  It is always fork tender, moist, and SPICY.  I typically order the adovada ribs entree and always take 1/2 home.  It's a lot of food and we never pass up the opportunity to order a sopapilla for dessert.  We also really like the green chile stew.  We've always received friendly and efficient service at this Los Dos location.  When they're busy, the kitchen bogs down a bit, but the ticket times never seem to get too long.  They keep the chip bowls full and the drinks coming while we wait.  That's enough to keep us happy!"}
{"text":"NOT FOR VEGGIES!  I was super eager to try this infamous place. I met my family (5 adults and 2 toddlers) here at 6 pm on a Saturday after hiking South Mountain. The wait was about 20 minutes, which was fine. The décor was fun and festive, far from fancy.  All 7 of us squished into a booth. The service was fair, though they handed us the check without asking if we wanted dessert (we did). For some reason this caused our server tons of confusion. The chips and salsa were good. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, which was just okay.  My family seemed to really like their meals. The sopapilla was good, just simple. My family liked the flan.  However, the menu had NOTHING vegetarian-- the beans are made with lard and the rice and enchilada sauce has chicken stalk. The tortillas likely had lard too.  I ate chips and salsa for my meal. I was deeply saddened, as I was starving for a cheese enchilada or a bean burrito after a 2 hour hike. In this day and age it baffles me that a restaurant can't put together ONE vegetarian option. Plenty of other authentic Mexican places are able, why not Los Dos? I'll never return :("}
{"text":"Here is the problem: we love Los Dos!  A couple months ago, gossips were running wild and implied Los Dos was closed on Warner due to Chapter XI.  It was partially true. They closed for one week to restructure. However Los Dos is alive and well! The food is as good as it has always been! Business has been slow for them as a result of false information.   Next time you're nearby, give them their support!"}
{"text":"It is insanely hard to find good New Mexican food outside of New Mexico.  Actually it's hard to find any New Mexican food outside of New Mexico.  Having lived in Phoenix for 6 years and frequently traveling to New Mexico, I am sad it took me so long to finally try Los Dos.    It was excellent.  Be prepared, New Mexican food is quite a bit spicier than traditional Mexican food.  Don't forget to finish your meal with a little sopapilla with honey for dessert!"}
{"text":"!! WARNING !! Their wait staff will tell you (on multiple occasions) that their sauces are NOT made with wheat flour.  Unfortunately, this is only true SOME of the time.  After breaking out in hives hours after eating here, I called and spoke to the owner's daughter.  It turns out that sometimes she uses corn starch and sometimes she uses flour.  WTF?  The moral of the story is, either ask the owner every time you come in, or avoid the sauces."}
{"text":"It's \"OK\".  I love spicy food, and like someone else said, some of their dishes seem spicy just to be spicy foregoing full flavor.  Their Margaritas are too sweet, IMO, but do pack a punch.  I also think their food is too salty, specifically their tortillas.  I also would NOT recommend the Mesa, AZ location.  It is nowhere near the quality of the Phoenix location.  I have been to the Phoenix location 8 times and the Mesa location 2 times and both Mesa experiences were sub-par.  If I were to rate based on the Mesa location I would give it a 1 or 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Well this place own up to their new Mexico hatch green chile, that's only reason why I scored it a 3. There rice was undercook and bland. And there tamale was old and hard. He replaced it with cheese enchilada with green. But the enchilada was microwave along with the cheese and green sauce cause it was lol rubbery. But I love the hatch green Chile sauce. I still prefer si senors over in chandler."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to come see John and his wonderful staff greet us with a smile and know what we want to order and drink! Thanks Los Dos staff you guys ROCK!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Los Dos Molinos for over 25 years... can't get enough. New Mexican style, hatch chile flavor (HOT!)  The food taste awesome but, beware... it will make the back of your neck sweat.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Food: Delicious Chips: Pleasing Service: Leaves much to be desired Margaritas: Not good  If you like spicy food and you aren't white, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Los Dos Molinos has good food.  I recommend the Mexican Pizza -- with the option to add ground beef. The shredded beef tacos are good, as well. Other than that, expect what is typical from a Mexican restaurant.  Yes, the food does have a small amount of spice, but I don't see what the big hype is (very mild to me). Also, the staff is generally very attentive.  And on the weekends, expect a large crowd.  Prices are reasonable. For example, a Deluxe Mexican Pizza is about $9. Tacos are about $4 each."}
{"text":"Some of the best, and hands down the spiciest Mexican food around.  I really like the spicy pork burrito. The pork is slow cooked and really tender the burrito is covered in a spicy green sauce that will make your nose and eyes watery while youre begging for more."}
{"text":"Meh. That's exactly how I feel about this place. The complimentary chips and salsa are good. In fact, the red salsa is really good. But the food kind of sucks. I'm not even trying to be mean. The beans taste alright. The rice sucks. I ordered the Shrimp Ajo (garlic shrimp). It was rubbery and didn't even taste like garlic. I've had Camarones al mojo de Ajo plenty of times. This was by far the worst.   My friend had the combo plate with two tacos, which was also terrible. They use cheap, packaged taco shells. They're not even fresh. I rather go to Del Taco or Taco Bell.   BUT... Despite that, we had a nice time on the patio. There was this dude playing acoustic songs. The Beerita wasn't too bad. A little tangy at first but the tequila allowed us to enjoy the afternoon here.  I doubt I'll ever come here again. Unless it's for drinks, chips and salsa while listening to live acoustic music on the patio. Nothing else."}
{"text":"Went to the bar. They have creepy old dude statue type chilling there. First bartender didn't even come over to greet us. After 5 mins or so, a woman came and dropped off chips and salsa and never returned. We walked out and will never return.   Way too many good restaurants out here to ever give this place a 2nd chance. I'm all about customer service and I've been to some sketch places in the hood where the homeless people were friendlier."}
{"text":"This place was kind of disappointing. I was excited to try some spicy Mexican food, but it just wasn't that great. I went here with the BF tonight and the service was quite bad. We got there at about 7:45 pm and were seated. Then we waited, and waited, and waited, about 15 minutes before the waiter even took our order. Then we proceeded to wait about another 30 minutes for our food. Also, the salsa they gave us was spicy, but the flavors were weird and neither of us really liked it much. When our food finally got there, it was also a disappointment. I ordered the combo #1 which was a taco and a cheese enchilada. The enchilada was actually pretty good, with a decent flavored sauce, but the taco was not good. The meat was tough and flavorless. The combo had a chili pepper next to it, so I thought it would be spicy, but it was kind of bland. The BF got a bean and cheese burrito and said it was alright, but nothing special. Maybe people really like this place because of the margaritas, they did look good, and probably would have made the food taste better and the service seem quicker. However, we did not get any margaritas. Also, it was very expensive for what we got, around 23$ with no drinks..... way too much for the quality of food they are serving. We will not be back."}
{"text":"It has been impossible to find good Mexican food in Phoenix. Christmas came early and I stumbled upon Los Dos. Flautas, are beyond amazing. Enchiladas, Christmas style, yes please. If you get the chance to sit in the bar area, Pedro is amazing!!"}
{"text":"We were hungryyyyyyy after swimming one day!  Good lord everything is spicy here! Holy hell! If you know me, you know that I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy. Apparently that is what they are known for because all of their dishes are spicy. Even the salsa and chips that you start out with!   We ordered the Posole with chicken. This was delicious!!!! Except it was extremely spicy. Well for me at least. We had to order sour cream with it to help with the spice. I think I would've enjoyed it more if it wasn't so spicy. It's a very big dish to share though. I ended up having leftovers to take home with me.   It's a cute little spot, the customer service was good. If you really want some spicy Mexican food this is the place to go. I might come back to try their drinks, but I can't handle the spicy food. lol."}
{"text":"Having visited LDM's bell cow location on Central, I was totally prepared to be underwhelmed by this stripmall-y location along the light rail line on Washington.   Well, not only was I not disappointed but I enjoyed one of my more rewarding lunch experiences of 2011. The service was no-nonsense but friendly and efficient and the food was pure LDM Scoville Scale bliss. I had the gringo friendly chimichanga with carne adobo, which was spicy and delicious and so filling I couldn't even finish, hard as I tried. The chips were warm and the salsas were up to LDM's reputation. Probably a tad hot for those who are spice challenged but perfect for my palate.   It sounds like a little thing but I was also really happy with the size of the glasses. My Diet Dr. Pepper came in what seemed like a 44 oz plastic cup. Did I need 44 oz of soda at lunch? That's not the point and mind your business. A bigger glass helped me get my fill of soda without bothering the busy staff for refill after refill.  The only downside of this lunch trip was that I was damn-near comatose following the meal. But that's on me, not LDM.   Big ups to Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"Ate at Los Dos Molinos for the first time Friday night, while visiting Mesa. It was great! The menu had a lot of choices besides just the usual Mexican dishes. Everything was fantastic, right down to the table chips and salsas. We had so much fun with some of the other guests and with the staff. My friend taught them how to make sangrita to chase tequila shots. We'll definitely come back when we're in town next time. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant !! We come here often and the food is always spot on. Most dishes are spicy, but tons of flavor. Great margaritas and sangria. The staff is very polite and friendly."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I ordered a chicken burrito and it came out cold! I get it- this happens. It wasn't what happened but how it was handled that bothered me. It took 15 minutes for our server to come back (after 3x of requesting him from bus boys/ explaining to them what happened) and when he came his reaction was very unprofessional. He did not apologize and ordered to MICROWAVE my burrito! I said no thanks and then he brought the check that included everything else but still no apology. Do not go to this restaurant because the service sucks."}
{"text":"Los Dos deserves every bit of it's excellent reputation.   I went with a group of ten friends on a Saturday night. We were seated immediately- no waiting. The music wasn't glaringly loud- it was festive, but we could hear one another. The decor was crazy Mexican- murals and cookie-cutter and surfboards and two inflatable planes crashing into each other.  Drinks were strong and appeared quickly, but weren't refilled often enough. Luckily, they had pitchers of water at the tables. A little cheap, but practical.  The green salsa was excellent, as were the warm, fresh tortilla chips. The red salsa was good, but nothing near the green.  The chicken chimichanga was out of this world, as were the shrimp veracruz. The beef burrito was good, and the tacos were okay.   Everything was spicey, but not nearly as bad as some people have made it out to be. Everyone in my party commented on it, but agreed that it was perfectly enjoyable and flavorful, not a cover-up for lack of taste.   I'd go again, but not in a group. They seemed overwhelmed by us (only 10!) and we didn't get very good service. Also, they won't split the check, even if you ask, and they tack on a hefty tip. Nothing unusual, but still annoying."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in the past few months.  Have had a variety of menu items, it's all fantastic! Service is hit 'n miss though and ipad for credit card signature is awkward."}
{"text":"I've been here about four times.  I've had the fish tacos more than once, and they are pretty good, though I don't care too much for the cream sauce they douse them with on occasion.    The slow-roasted pork burrito is delicious.    Their refried beans and rice are pretty good.  They aren't bland like they are at many other restaurants.    The guacamole is not very good.  Two of the times I ordered it, it came out in some strange brownish, grayish color.  Expensive, too.  $3-4 for nothing more than three or four tablespoons.  The prices overall are pretty expensive for a Mexican restaurant.  I'm not sure what it is with restaurants like this but MEXICAN FOOD IS NOT MEANT TO BE EXPENSIVE.  It is predominantly made from beans, rice, corn, flour, onions, tomatoes, peppers, and a little bit of meat.  So, why are we paying $13 for an entre?  The atmosphere inside is awesome.  Just what you'd expect from a hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint (which, oddly enough, is in a strip mall).    BOTTOM LINE:  nice choice for a meal, though I think you can do better for the price (or just as good for cheaper)."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the valley!  If you like spicy then this is the place for you. The salsa is spicy & the signature dish is probably my favorite dish in the world. Get the Adovada Ribs & you will not regret it. Throw the magical meat in some homemade tortillas and enjoy."}
{"text":"Funky Catina with original artwork on the walls. The complimentary red and green salsa is smoky, roasted and hotter than your average salsa. The chips were toasted, thin and crispy. I chose the Camaron Fundido (Shrimp over cheesy, creamy, rice) the prawns were large and lovely. It was served with whole beans and homemade flour tortilla. I scrapped the plate. Be careful, if you don't like spicy, this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar.  It was too dark.  No one needing a menu could read it- everyone had to get their phones out.  Service was good.  My food was 'Meh'.  Ordered a beef taco with rice. Not very tasty- ordinary.  The only part that stood out was the hard shell- surprisingly thin which was good.  The rice was almost cold.  It was dry and not very good.  My husband LOVES the enchiladas here though.  About 15 years ago we went to the south mountain location.  Staff was horrid, but the food was amazing.  Was super excited to come across this on Camelback hoping for some decent tasting New Mexican food.  I think they likely have their specialties and the taco was not that.  Not many vegetarian options other than cheese.  Not veggie Burrito or anything like that.  I will stick with Via De los Santos in Sunnyslope.  MUCH better."}
{"text":"Service at this location is absolutely terrible.  (I have eaten at the Mesa, S.Phoenix & Springerville restaurants many times and had a great experience).   The waitress (Marci) failed to even place my daughter's order, so my meal came out, but not hers. The server asked if I wanted an extra plate???  I told him no, she ordered a meal too.  He looked confused and disappeared into the kitchen.  NO ONE came out to our table and told us what was going on!!!  After some time had passed, the \"real\" waitress, Marci, came out with a plate of food for my daughter.  And guess what, it was wrong!  She ordered 2 chicken tacos and they brought beef.  I looked at my meal and discovered that my meal was wrong as well.  At no time, did Marci say she was sorry, or offer to reduce our bill.  This place is a mass of confusion.  There are so many busboys, servers, etc. running around, but no one seems to take responsibility for anything.  The busboy (I thought he was our waiter) asked us if we wanted anything to drink but then disappeared and never brought our drinks!!  The \"real\" waitress was actually sitting at a nearby table talking with customers. The red headed young man, who acts like the maitre d, chatting up the customers and proudly telling everyone that he a friend of the son of the owner, turned out to be a busboy.    It's really unfortunate that the service is so crappy, because I do like the food. But I refuse to pay $50 for a mexican meal just to be treated so poorly.  I'd rather go down the road to Arriba where you get mediocre food but better service."}
{"text":"The fresh, warm chips and variety of salsa cannot be beaten! My favourite is the red salsa that comes with the chips. I could eat it by the spoonful, as I love spice with depth of flavor! Also the beans are some of the best I have ever had, you may see in the pictures that myself and the two I was with skipped the rice for a double helping of beans. Worth it, worth it, worth it!  Add in speed service, great drinks that come by the PITCHER (I recommend the Prickly Pear Margareta) and an atmosphere to boot and you have my version of  New Mexican Food Heaven."}
{"text":"It's was quite shocking to me to see a 2009 Yelp Award sitting on the counter-top of this establishment.   The award identified that the restaurant  was awarded #1 Mexican and #1 Bar.  (More on this later)  We arrived at this establishment and were seated by a waiter who asked us if we'd like something to drink besides water.  A bit on the rude side but I was willing to let it slide.     We were provided with a small bowl of chips and two salsa varieties.  A green salsa that looked and tasted like jalapeno and green chile swimming in pickle juice.   The red was the more edible of the two but nowhere near \"New Mexican.\"      My roommate and I were hungry and quickly went through the chips.  When my roommate asked for more chips the waiter looked extremely put off by the fact that he was asking and rudely retorted..\"that's going to be $1.00 extra.\"   My roommate commented \"Wow they really  take their rules seriously here.\"   This took me back to all the \"Don't s\" the menu contained.  \"No Subsitutions.\"  \"We Don't Split Checks\"   \"We don't know how to make mild chile.\"  \"One Free Refill.\"  All that would fall under good customer service is clearly displayed on their menus and at the door as something that they \"don't\" do.    We got  our food seconds after my roommate requested more chips.  (what a waste of a dollar).  My roommate order a white corn chicken enchilada with green chile.  I ordered the blue corn chicken enchilada with red.  Both my roommate and I are native New Mexicans and know good chile.  Neither the red or green was good.  The red was the more edible of the two.   I don't understand how there are so many reviews on Yelp that say the food is hot or spicy.   The chile is absolutely bland and dull.   I would dare say that they don't even use real New Mexico chile.    I was actually quite impressed with the touch of the fried egg on top of the enchilada.  This was a rather authentic touch.  This is where it all went downhill.  As I dug down I realized that my enchilada consisted of one thick flat electric blue tortilla with chicken and cheese, covered in red \"chile\" and a fried egg.    The tortilla was clearly not made with real blue corn. It was homemade to their credit but the tortilla was nothing more than an extra thick tortilla made with Maseca and blue food coloring.  I kid not when I say that it looked like something a child would make with blue play dough.   The bad service continued throughout the rest of dinner with the wait staff never coming back to make sure everything was alright. NOTHING.    Which leads to my final thoughts going back to why I pointed out that this place actually won a yelp award.  The only thing the staff seemed to do with gusto was serving the Margaritas which they were churning out in pitchers at a furious pace.  I can definitely see how the possibility of them winning #1 bar could happen.  Which leads me to my final thought.   TIPSY bi****es should not be allowed to vote!  For a real New Mexican experience in the Valley of The Sun Visit Si Senor in Chandler."}
{"text":"Great place for a beer and some awesome New Mexico style food. Their motto is Some Like It Hot, so be forewarned, although they do have some non-spicy items too. Half of the building is for the restaurant and half for the bar.  Looks like a dive but it's really not. It's a cute mom-and- pop establishment, well lit, and kid-friendly. We really enjoyed our lunch and will be back."}
{"text":"We had heard about the downtown Phoenix Los Dos Molinos being so good and hoped this restaurant of the same chain would be as good. Our waiter assured us that the menu and quality are the same. I ordered the two taco special with carne asada steak. My husband ordered the beef enchilada special and was warned that it would be spicy. The sauces are made with hatch chilis, which fits with its New Mexico-themed menu. My husband decided after tasting my mildly -spicy only tacos that he would stay away from the spicy options next time and go with 'mild' in the future. One can always add      either the complimentary green or red salsa if one wants it hotter. We loved the beans. Spanish rice seemed pretty ordinary. Vanilla flan was outstanding. Excellent service by all staff. We would recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something other than the typical Sonoran fare in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I used to work right around the corner from here, and all of us \"office girls\" would go to lunch every month to \"Los Dos.\" The machaca is excellent!  I love my food a bit spicy.  Hey, if it doesn't make you cry while you eat it, what's the point? Service is super-friendly and so are the other customers.   The place used to be a morgue or something.  I love the outdoor area to sit while waiting."}
{"text":"This place has terrible food and way overly priced. I love Mexican food and I love spicy food, but this place is just gross. I went with my three girlfriends and every one of us hated the food. Green chile burrito, beef tacos, and enchiladas  were terribly bland. I think they make it so hot because  the food has no flavor. We have up on the food and just wanted to sit and enojoy our drinks and chips and salsa. Too bad the salsa was flavorless."}
{"text":"Popped in here by myself for dinner right after opening at 5pm.   Decided to go with the Adovada \"Burro\" (pork burrito) combo w/rice and beans and a Negro Modelo to quench the flames.  No complaints about the service on my particular visit, although I would guess that it was actually the owner who served me.  I was checked up on a couple of times by two different people after being served.    I appreciated the fact that an entire pitcher of ice water was set in front of me along with the chips and salsa, although I wondered if this was an ominous foreshadowing of things to come.   The food came out fast, and when I dug in I was not disappointed in either the flavor or the spiciness.  My head was already preheated with the chips and salsa, so by the time I started on the burrito, I had to pace myself.  Each bite packed a powerful punch, and several times I had to stop eating and let the perspiration and hot flashes subside before carefully sawing off another non-lethal dose.  The atmosphere was alright, not exactly the most enchanting mexican restaurant I've ever been in, but I did dig the music.   Beer was $4.25 and the the entre was approx $11, total with tax came to $17.50.   It was a lot of food, so I took half home.   I'll have to come back to give the tortillas and margaritas a shot."}
{"text":"Right when we walked In we were greeted immediately. We sat down and they brought over a pitcher of water and chips and salsa.  Can I just say that finally I have found amazing, hot salsa...finally! We mixed the red and green salsas together, try it you will love it. I also got a margarita which was yummy and strong. We ordered the chicken burrito and I ordered the number 3 combo but I didnt want a beef taco, I would rather have chicken. The server told me that they don't do substitutions but she would ask, I said no big deal, if they will do it then cool, if not then just order everything separate and put it on the same plate.  The server came back and announced that they would do the substitution. Awesome!  The food was good. Im not a fan of their beans but I was born and raised in new Mexico so I'm a little bit picky lol.  All in all this is the best place I've been to in several months. Not only was the food good but the service is amazing! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place... People are amazing!!! The Margaritas are always perfect and the food is on point. I would highly recommend this place if you feel like Margaritas and Mexican food."}
{"text":"If you're a vegetarian do not go here...there is not one vegetarian item on the menu. The guacamole tostada sounds like a safe bet right? NOPE! There's lard in the tostada. Lard in the tortilla chips too...ugh.   Not only does the menu suck, the service is 50 times worse. The restaurant literally has 13 tables in what feels like a 10x10 jail cell. My boyfriend and I waited for the check for literally over 20 minutes....just sitting....and waiting. It took us less time to drive there, order, get our food, and eat than it did to get the check.   Don't expect your drink to be refilled either...unless you're drinking water.    The food....not even that good."}
{"text":"I think I got Chicken Enchilada with green sauce.  Great job.  Lot of TV's.  Very HOT salsa.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food is ok but nothing special.  The patio is a nice place to hang out on a cool afternoon. The service was very slow. We finally got up and went inside to find someone to pay. Overall, for the price point I'd rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great service but way over priced micheladas. I paid $8.95  for dinner and drinks for 2 it came out to $90. {for Mexican food} the most I've ever spent. They also need to invest in a better cash register/receipt system. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"We went around 5PM on a Saturday and enjoyed everything we had. For $47 before tip, we had 2 beers, one huge margarita, the queso appetizer, 2 entrees, and an order of sopapillas with honey for dessert (a bargain!). The servers were working as a team so there was constantly someone checking up on us, they were very attentive.   The $5 queso dip is a steal for that price (also, this was the spiciest item we had, and everything was spicy, so that says something, be warned!).   The \"medium\" Kick Ass margarita was HUGE. My dining partner had the carne adovada chimichanga and I had the adovada chile relleno, both were very spicy but very delicious. The sweetness of the honey & sopapillas helped us cool our tastebuds to end our meal.  If you like spicy food and green chile, this is the place for you. If you do not like spicy food, do not go here (no one wants to hear about how it was too spicy for you if you have already been warned that they specialize in SPICY). We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great green chili and adovada enchilada. Salsa is pretty darn spicy. Great service ... it's a must try if you're visiting Phienix"}
{"text":"The food was really great! I came here with my family in law and they were really excited to show me the great food to Arizona have to offer. I ordered the enchilada plate with chicken. The only thing that really threw me off was the bone that I found on my plate. Other than that the flavors are great complex and spicy. I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"As someone who no longer lives in New Mexico but still considers herself a New Mexican at heart, I crave New Mexican food on a regular basis. So, when I come  to Phoenix, I must have a New Mexican food fix!  Several visits ago my sister took me to Los Dos Molinos and we found it fits the bill as well as any displaced New Mexican could ask.   Today we ate at the Camelback location for the first time. The building is a cute Adobe with an inviting entry. Inside, the decor is colorful with many New Mexico themed paintings. We arrived right at lunch time, yet were greeted and seated immediately by Jorge, who ended up being our server. The service was efficient and friendly throughout our meal.   Now for the food.  How do I describe the taste of heaven? We started off with the spicy nacho cheese (a special) to accompany our freshly fried chips: wonderful flavor at a spice level that had heat but was not overdone. For my entrée I ordered a machaca-filled chimichanga with green sauce. Machaca at Los Dos is like no other I have had. It is their delicious shredded beef tossed in their equally delicious spicy red sauce. The combination of flavors was delectable and, to my surprise, just spicy enough to keep things interesting.  My sister had a green corn tamale that was also amazing.  The beans and rice were pretty standard fare, but also good, and provided a welcome break from the heat, as did the side of sour cream and guacamole that came with the chimi.  Needless to say, I am already planning my next visit to my sister and nephew.  It's the family I am coming back for,  right?"}
{"text":"First, let's get this clear: Los Dos is *not* a \"Mexican\" restaurant.  It is \"New Mexican.\"  So if you're expecting whatever your idea of Mexican food is, you'll be confused and disappointed.  No soft tacos, no fish tacos, no big piles of tomato and lettuce with a side of sour cream.  Even the chips and salsa are different--the chips are thicker and crunchier, and the salsa is thin.  And there is no *mild* salsa.    I do not recommend this place for vegetarians,  nor is it for folks who don't like spicy food.  I also do not recommend their margaritas, unless you're okay with paying 10 bucks for a weak, too-sweet drink--to be fair, I like my margaritas the real, old-school way: tequila, triple sec, lime juice.  That's it.   But beer lovers should find something they'll like.  If you're smart, you'll steer clear of the pedestrian fare on the a la cart and combo menus and order from the \"chef's specials\" section.  I highly recommend the chile relleno with adovada and the chile plate with machaca.  Of course, you can customize several of the dishes by selecting whichever meat you want--chicken, adovada, machaca, etc. The only non-spicy option here is the carnitas, which I never order because I love the adovada too much to pass up on it.  The plates come with beans (very good) and rice (okay), and the servings are huge. The tortillas served on the side are thick, chewy and the perfect vehicle for sopping up all the spicy, gooey goodness on your plate.  I always end up needing a to-go box, which I invariably send home with my partner--one \"cheat\" a week is plenty, thanks!  The servers have always been friendly on my visits.  Last night, we had a very sweet young man who was as attentive as we would want.  The kitchen and the bar can be slow, though.  So don't expect to get in and out quickly.  The only thing that I totally disapprove of is the way the bill is sometimes presented.  Depending on how busy they are, sometimes the waiter brings you an iPad sort of device, and then stands there while you sign your bill.  I don't have an issue with going digital.  My problem is that the screen basically demands that you select from one of three pre-set tip amounts--I think it's 18, 20 and 22%.  I find that incredibly tacky, presumptuous and very awkward, since the server is standing there, waiting for you to finish with the device.   So I hope that the owners of this location are listening: Some of your guests may not know how to calculate a tip, but please don't insult those of us who do.  Do not impose upon our judgement of the service.  If you're *really* worried about your servers being screwed over by angry/cheap customers, make sure your employees do their jobs well, and/or pay them better.  Thanks."}
{"text":"We had a large party that was very hard to keep up with but they did a wonderful job. The food was pretty spicy but good and the drinks were delicious, especially the margaritas. All in all, we were all impressed."}
{"text":"Close the store before you get a worse rep:  2 Negro Modelos, 1 Ice Tea and Burro Plate - I miss Eddie, his daughter and Tony!!! If you do not know what I am talking about then stop reading now, you are not a long time patron of Los Dos. I have been going to \"The Los\" since before they accepted plastic. Eddie and his Daughter would carry my baby Boy and Daughter, enuf with the back ground. Now to the management of this place in Ahwatukee: Take your place and jump in the lake. I have tried to like this place over and over and over again. Been there 10 times and the best I can say was it was marginal in over all experience. Today broke this camel's back and I am never coming back and I am going to tell everyone of today's experience. A friend and I walked in there at 4:15 today hoping to have a few drinks and appetizers. Since I have a very bad back we walked into the bar area to sit in the booth in the corner next to the kitchen. There was 1 customer at the bar and 2 customers sitting at a 4 top table. Two server like people where in the bar area and did not say a welcome or anything to us. As we walked towards the booth one guy (could not tell if he was management, kitchen help or what) asked if he could help us, we said we were there for some drinks and food, he asked us if it was just for two people and I said yes but we would like to sit at the booth, he said it was reserved already (WTF!), there was only 3 other customer's in the place but I assumed the \"people\" who had it reserved where on their way. So we decided that my friend would sit at the bar and I would stand. When we walked up to the bar both the guy who told us we could not sit in the booth and the other employee walked out of the bar area. 4 minutes went by, then another 4 and then finally the other employee \"GQ Looking Young guy\" asked if we, \"wanted a drink or something\" as if we insulted him just being there. We ordered drinks and got a basket of chips and salsa and talked while we went over the menu. We talked for so long and ate almost the entire basket of chips before the first guy who told us the booth was reserved asked us if we were going to order food. I ordered the green chili burro with beef and it was supposed to come with a side of beans for $11. After we ordered I went to the bathroom and the mens room was as hot as a sauna and there was not a soul in the dinning area. So the only patrons where the ones that were there before. My burro came with out the side of beans and the tortilla was not cooked all the way ie. it was gummy and kinda opaque. I was so hungry that I looked passed the uncooked tortilla and started eating it. It was acceptable but not great. No one came and checked on the food and I had to beg to get more chips and salsa. In the mean time no one came to use the booth that was \"reserved\" (which made me even more happy to be treated like a red headed step child no offense to Red Heads). So we asked for the check so we could get the hell out of there. When it was presented I asked if the beers had been discounted for the \"Happy Hour $1 Off Pricing\" (of course at $4.50 i would have guessed not). I was right \"GQ\" Guy did not give me the happy hour pricing. I was not going to leave any tip but I just cant do it. I know money is scarce in the food and beverage industry and I still try to walk in other peoples shoes. I did find out that the name of the guy who told me I could not use the booth was Mikey and our server was Corey. If I was a video camera I would be replaying the entire visit over and over again so you could see it. So it is going to be a while before I even can say \"Los Dos\" with out cursing. Coming from the food and beverage industry and other service industries hurting in this trying time makes this all the more painful. Save your money and your feelings, because this place could care less if you walk out of there with a good experience or not. If I ever have to have another dose of Los Dos I will go to the Central South of Baseline location and pray they have not lost their love for making people feel welcome. This really pained me to write but my anger over came it."}
{"text":"Why put in a location downtown location and refuse to accomodate the business lunch crowd?  Food is fine but the customer service is lacking.  Our party of 7 was reminded \"no separate checks\".  So, on the back of a napkin we do our math... Restaurant barely 1/2 full, but it's too much to split a check.  Service abismal."}
{"text":"Calling all spicy chili lovers!  This restaurant specializes in New Mexican fare (think red and green chili).  It's a true hole-in-the-wall, not fancy at all, laidback and casual eatery.  Their menu says they don't know how to make \"mild\" spice, and this is definitely true.  I'm usually a medium spice eater, but after munching on their chips and salsa, my mouth was burning and I was starting to sweat!  It was tasty, don't get me wrong.  I figured I couldn't endure much more heat, so I ordered their Carnitas plate (it was one of the few items on the menu without a SPICY indication).  It came with LOTS of meat, rice, brown beans, and a thick flour tortilla.  The dish was totally mild, not a bit of spice anywhere in it.  I added some spice by adding some salsa to it, and it ended up being balanced quite nicely.  So overall, it's typical Meixcan fare, with a New Mexico twist.  If you're into super duper spicy, you'll want to check this place out.  One tip - it's a little hard to find at night bc they don't have a light up sign.  The name of the restaurant is just painted in huge letters on the front of the building."}
{"text":"1. Margaritas are da-bommmmb! They do not go easy on the tequila. 2. Owner is super friendly, always sits down to talk to his customers and even offers FREE ROUNDS OF DRINKS! 3. Salsa & Chips are  spicy, just the way i like it. 4. Authentic Mexican food 5. Family owned, staff is super friendly and caring of your needs. 6....did i mention the huge margaritas yet?"}
{"text":"I finally went there with someone who was willing to both eat amazingly hot food and wait as long as possible.  And wouldn't it just figure that for the first time, there was no wait.  I don't know what good Karma I had going, but we walked right into the place.  Sure it was a Thursday, but come on!!    So, yea. It's hot.  But you knew it would be hot.  What I didn't hear so much about was how it manages to be really really good while not doing anything \"special\".  Our plain Cheese Quesadilla was amazing - but it was just cheese and tortilla.  But they managed to cover the ENTIRE thing with thick yummy cheese - and no big bubbles either - yet the tortilla was still 100% crisp.  Everything was like that.  Describing it might not sound exceptional, until you realize how rare those things are to find all in one place.  And their mexican rice had the most amazing taste - neither of us could place which spices we were tasting that were so different.    Outside is a mess of tables and chairs that HAVE to be there when they are packed, but it looked a bit like Coney Island in the off season to go through there when no one else was there.    Personal tip?  If you are worried about the spice of your dish - get it with the sauce on the side.  That's where all the heat is.  My companion did that with the Chimi and found it to be the perfect way to make sure she got all the flavor of the sauce, without being overwhelmed by it in every single bite."}
{"text":"We tried to eat here for the first time on Cinco de Mayo.  Our usual Mexican restaurant was super busy so we thought we would try something new.  When we arrived, the main entrance was blocked by a speaker and we had to go in through the patio entrance.  The staff appeared disinterested in seating us.  There seemed to be some argument among the servers about letting us sit in the booth that we requested.  The servers didn't appear to want to even clean the table.  We finally talked someone into sitting us at a different table.  He informed us that they were out of chips and salsa, and asked if we wanted to stay.  The server told us she would be back to take our order in a few minutes.  I don't know how she planned on taking our order, since she removed the menus from the table when we sat down.  The whole staff was clearly disinterested in our business.  We ended up leaving rather than prolong our negative experience.  We will continue to go to our regular Mexican restaurant rather than give this place another chance. Overall:  Terrible customer service.  Unsure about the food since we didn't stay to eat, which is why I gave the place two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"This has to be the filthiest restaurant I've ever been to.  Everything is dirty -- the tables, seating and menus.  The service is SLOW and RUDE.  Two of us went on a Saturday afternoon when there were only two other tables of people in the entire restaurant, and similar to other reviewers' experiences, we stood at the front for a while before we were seated, and then it took another 10 minutes for the server to come over and ask us if we wanted drinks.  When we complained that we had been sitting there for 10 minutes, the waitress copped an attitude and acted as if she were doing us a favor by taking our orders.  The food was blah -- nothing to get excited about.  The only good thing about this place is the margaritas, but they're not good enough for me to go back!"}
{"text":"I frequently travel all the way from Gilbert just to eat here. 35 miles of driving which has always been well worth it. I've tried the one in Mesa but I don't find it to be as good as the original. They have amazing New Mexican style cuisine. I do love it spicy though, and they're the spiciest mexican food I've ever had. They do have a lot of non spicy stuff too. Out of town guests I've taken, who aren't into anything spicy, have found it to be very good. I think the milder part of the menu have been just as appetizing, sometimes moreso because you're not sweating bullets and downing 5 glasses of water just to make the burn go away.   You can wait a long time for a table, so be prepared to wait, but if you go during off times, like after the lunch crowd or right before the dinner crowd you shouldn't have a wait. The margaritas will kick your ass too. Get a pitcher and make it a day drinking, hotter than hell Mexican extravaganza."}
{"text":"This place is awwsome! So spicy! Margaritas are bomb an service is so fast! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but alas, I didn't. the salsas were good and spicy. chips were eh, alright. I had the carnitas...tons of fat. I get it, pork is a fatty meat and it gives more flavor, but I think for 14.95, they could certainly have cleaned it up a bit. My beans had fat pieces in it too. Chewy and nasty when you don't expect it. My friend had the garlic pork. Flavorless and a small portion. My other friend had the Carne Adovada chimi. Christmas style. It was actually pretty good. Spicy red and green sauce, lots of heat. We had the chorizo dip. It was chorizo and a dollop of sour cream with 4 overcooked pita chips. So, here's the clincher. They give you a plate of meat that in the menu says...\"served with tortillaS \". Nope, you get 1. Just 1. It's 1.50 for an extra tortilla. Not a side, A tortilla. F' ing ridiculous. When we asked our server for another and he told us that it's extra, he followed it up by saying that they're homemade and hard to make so that's why they're extra. I won't go back for this very reason but then the manager came by and asked how everything was so we told him and he just nodded like he couldn't understand what we were saying. Right then, he could have saved us as customers. I believe in giving 2nd chances and I would've just tried the tacos but that manager just looked at us like he couldn't believe we wanted another 5inch tortilla. The service was decent enough but I wish servers would tell their names but it's not a deal breaker if they don't. Also, there's an extra charge for more chips and extra charge for more salsa. They overcharge for what they serve anyways so added charges for that stuff is ridiculous! So....ADIOS Los Dos, I will not be back."}
{"text":"HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT!HOT! HOT! HOT!HOT! HOT! HOT!HOT! HOT! HOT!HOT! HOT! HOT!HOT! HOT! HOT!  I'm not talking fresh-out-of-the-oven-burn-your-mouth hot. I'm talking all-jacked-up-on-steroid-spice hot.   But if hot's you, then you ought to eat here.   I've been here a handful of times with the family... particularly because it's my dad's favorite place. From the spicy beef pizza to a shrimp dish, my mouth always burns!   Forget the salsa. Don't go anywhere near it if you can't stand the flames.   Order a margarita. They're heavenly and HUGE! And the perfect companion to the dishes this restaurant serves up."}
{"text":"Went for lunch so I was thinking lunch prices. First, margaritas are $9.  Sorry, but that is ridiculous.  I opted not to get one but my husband did.  Good thing because it was pure alcohol.  If you actually enjoy margaritas for the taste and not the alcohol content you will not like this.  They do not have a very large menu.  Most items are $14+ unless you want a basic burrito for $8.95 but then rice and beans are $4 extra. I figured maybe I would just get two tacos but those were almost $5 each.  For ONE taco. Oh and add a dollar if you want soft tortilla instead of hard shell. What?!  I ended up ordering the chorizo appetizer and my husband had the burrito.  The food was very good I will admit.  I love spicy and mine was spicy.  We ended up taking some home as the portions were large.  I don't however see us going back soon. Yes the food was good but I feel like they nickel and dime you here.   Too expensive for my taste."}
{"text":"My father loves Los Dos Molinos, an Arizona tradition for as long as I've lived in the Valley of the Sun.  When coming to the Valley from South Carolina, his first stop is always at his favorite restaurant.  He even wears a Los Dos Molinos T-Shirt TO Los Dos Molinos, so you can imagine he's a pretty big fan. Today we went to the location on Chandler Blvd in the Ahwatukee area, for the first, and probably last, time.  What could possibly be so wrong that a restaurant I've been going to since I was a child has made it onto the \"do not bother\" list?  It ain't the food, because the food at any Los Dos Molinos location is going to be excellent.  Instead, it was the service that I found questionable, namely, the use of the Ipad in their billing.  I have never, EVER had a waiter announce to an entire restaurant of people what my bill has come to.  I have never seen a waiter stand over someone while they're deciding what tip to give, and frankly, it's a scam.  If you can't bother to print out a bill and give it to me, don't expect me to come back.  I'd suggest hitting one of the alternate locations if you want Los Dos, and do it before they all adopt this idiotic billing system."}
{"text":"Pretty shocked this place only has 3.5 stars as it's one of my all-time favorites in the Valley.   Family owned, HOT AS HELLLLLL salsa, strong margs, and a solid menu. I demand a visit to Los Dos every single time I am home. I dream about the absurdly spicy salsa, washed down with an absurdly large margarita on the rocks. Chile rellanos are super good, as is the spicy shrimp. Their puerco dishes are also amazing. Adovado burro what what.   Sometimes, it can be a wait for the food (I'm looking at you Friday nights), but why would you care? You have endless chips and salsa to devour + that huge ass margarita to work on. The atmosphere is fun too, lively, loud, families enjoying deliciousness.   Do not come here if you can't handle the heat."}
{"text":"I have never received worse service in my life. My two friends and I came around 7 pm. We were not greeted for 10 minutes. When we were greeted we were brought the wrong drinks. We then did not see any server for ten minutes to get the right drinks. When we made our food order I asked for a mild version of the enchiladas due to a stomach issue and the waiter said that could be done. The food did come out in good time but when I got my enchilada it was terribly spicy and overall inedible. 20 minutes later.... when we saw our waitress again I asked her if I could order something else because it was far too spicy and not what I  ordered. She said \"its new mexico style- we don't offer a mild version\" I told her the waiter should have informed me that when he told me they could make it mild. We were met with a huge eye roll and a firm reach to take my plate. At that time I order chicken floutas instead since nothing else could be made mild. My friend ordered a refill on her drink, something we had not been given all night... it was not busy at all on a Tuesday night! By the time my new plate came out 30 minutes later my friend still had not received her refill. She walked up to the girl who took my order and said Hi do you think I could get my refill on my coke that I ordered and the girl eye rolled again and said \"well you didn't order it from me\". She brought her a coke and then the check immediately before I even finished eating.  They came back and asked for our payment three times will picking up one thing off the table at a time. More than we had seen them all night! Worst service I have ever had. Terrible wait staff with no customer service experience. The food was decent but the staff needs some training."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but the service is....Uggghh.  Been a few times and am used to slow service or them forgetting to bring items, but today the female server was just rude.  I don't know if she just didn't want to be there or didn't want us to be there...either way it left my table with a bad experience. Too bad."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service, very generous with meat proportions, very spicy and inexpensive! Love it!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding. Seriously the best mexican food I've found in the valley and believe me I have been looking. Growing up close to the border, its hard to find the same thing the further away you go. I also appreciate the fact that they appreciate our vets and give 50% discount to our service members."}
{"text":"Came down for Spring Training and this place was the highlight of the trip. Went several times and ate something different each time. Not your typical \"Mexican\" food. Used the waiters recommendation and was very satisfied. The food is spicy as well....be warned"}
{"text":"August 2016 Edit ...  I'm modifying my review. The original review below was for the old location (on Chandler Blvd). I've visited once since they moved to the Warner Rd location and the service much better. Raising the review from 2 to 4 stars.  This was my second visit to this Los Dos Molinos.  The first experience was fairly good with good food and decent service.  This one I can't comment on the food because we never had our order taken.  It appeared there was one waitress and one bartender and one busman.  Chips and salsa were brought promptly and the salsa was excellent as always.  However the waitress never came by to take our order.  After about 15 minutes we left for Arriba's where the service was excellent as always."}
{"text":"We eat here probably once a week. We have for years now... there is no better Mexican food in the East Valley as far as I'm concerned. It's family-owned establishment, so over the years, we've gotten to know everyone. For us, it's kinda like Cheers (e.g., \"Norm!\")... and I've noticed that they're like that with all their regulars, so I think that's really cool. That kind of thing is rare...  The food is amazing. The garlic pork roast burrito is the yummiest thing in the world, and since I became a vegetarian, it's the only thing I truly miss in terms of being a carnivore. But they have been keeping me happy even as a vegetarian. The red and green chile are SPICY. like atomic hot, so be careful. It took me a long time to get used to ti, but it's SO good. They also have plenty of non-spicy options if you're not feeling   The atmosphere and the quality of the food make it worth every visit."}
{"text":"I've been going to Los Dos Molinos for over 15 years. This location is busy most of the time but we've always gotten a seat in a short amount of time. The food is good for the price and the service is good. If you're looking for a decent Mexican restaurant give them a try. You won't be disappointed.    They close down for a couple of weeks in the summer for vacation."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended from a colleague of mine and I have to say that I nor my wife were impressed.   What we liked: -The decor was interesting -The server was friendly  What we didn't like: -No mild salsa (all hot) -No kids menu -Cheese crisp soaked through in grease -Ordered Guac, didnt get it -Cant get queso on a chimi unless you order a full queso dip appetizer -Chimi was soaked in grease -Spicy Adovado Ribs were not spicy at all -Adovado ribs came with one thick flour tortilla. Thick flour tortilla = no bueno  There are a lot of great Mexican restaurants in the valley and this one did not make the cut for us. With all that was wrong with our experience with Los Dos Molinos we will not be back."}
{"text":"Unfornately bad shrimp can make you very, very ill...  First time visit at this restaurant and unfornately was unlucky enough to get food poisoning from the dish I ordered which was the Shrimp Veracruz which had been recommended to me by the waiter.  Have been terribly sick for the past two days throwing up and with the runs and still have a terrible burn down my esophagus which still hasn't gone away.  At first, the owner was defensive when in a nice way I told him that I had gotten sick from eating at his restaurant.  He took my number and never called me back.  I called him back today and told him that not only did I get sick but now my wife who had a single piece of jumbo shrimp off my plate also is now sick a day later and so the least they could do is refund our tab.  The owner finally apologized and did refund our tab and offered to cover our possible (but unlikely) next visit so that is why I am putting 2 stars instead of 1.  Also, he promised he would follow up with his \"shrimp and chicken\" guy so hopefully no one else gets sick.  This is hopefully a rare occurrence and our experience is hopefully isolated and not the norm so I'm not saying don't try this restaurant at all esp. if you like super hot and spicy New Mexican style food however be aware that you can get extremely sick from improperly prepared or contaminated shellfish and this is a first for me personally and I hope I never have to experience this again."}
{"text":"I came to Los Dos Molinos recently as I got recommendation for \"spicy\" Mexican food.  People, the amount of spice level is no joke.  I felt like I was on fire when eating the salsa, and I have a pretty high tolerance for spice level.  If you check in on yelp, you get free cheese crisp, which is nice.  I think overall our food was fairly okay.  I did not eat much for that day, but my friend seemed to enjoy his pork burrito."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Los Dos! One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Arizona. I always get their adovada ribs. Their food is amazing but packs quite a powerful punch. (Spicy)"}
{"text":"SPICY!  Most of the food here brings the heat, and I'm very sensitive...but I still love the occasional kick.  The flautas are not spicy at all, and the margaritas are fab."}
{"text":"Margaritas are good but that's just about all I will say for it.  I didn't care for their food very much.  Tried just about everything on the menu in my visits there.  Struck out, not for me but a lot of people love it."}
{"text":"Los dos Molinos is a quaint Mexican restaurant in ahwatukee. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a nice middle aged couple. The menu seemed to be very authentic and had different items that I've never seen before. This was interesting but, I am kind of a pikey eater so none of these cool items appealed to me.   The overall service was kind of bad it took about ten minutes for drinks to arrive. I only got one refill the whole night. When the food arrived it was really good it had a great flavor. I ordered blue corn enchilada's, that's something I've never had before. Everything was great. Even the bathrooms were clean, and the staff was great.   If you are craving good authentic Mexican food, this is the place to go. If your In a rush I wouldn't recommend this place due to the bad service. But if you have time on your hands, this is defiantly a place you should stop in and check out. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Been coming here for 6 years now, tried everything on the menu, great staff, no nonsense attitude, hot as balls food, amazing flavors, homemade everything! Roast pork, machacha and the guacamole... my god, the guacamole is amaxong\""}
{"text":"Favorite place to bring out-of-towners to who want good southwest cuisine that's not overpriced or bland."}
{"text":"This is a place that I didn't really want to yelp because I don't want it to get any busier.  But they deserve their kudos too. The margaritas are superb!  I love the square glasses. And honestly it doesn't matter what you order- it is all so good here.  The salsa actually has flavor and isn't a runny mess. My favorite dish is the flautas but everything is worthy of a try.  One of my favorite restaurants as you just can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Too noisy and dark more of a bar then a restaurant ambiance; Nothing of extra ordinary , and on the more pricy of your average Mexican food.  Just extra spicy . Be aware --- They nickel and dime if you ask for extra tortilla chips or tortillas served with your plate."}
{"text":"Always a great place to get authentic, home made Mexican food in a casual environment. The house Sangria is also home made and delicioso!"}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service. So dissapointed. Rude waiter who made us very uncomfortable & rushed us all the way through our meal. The quality of food was very poor. Enhilada dish did not resemble anything close to an enchilada. Chips were stale and dishes were dirty. I will never go here again nor recommend."}
{"text":"Some of these haters just hating.  This place is legit.  Superb.  Expecto Awesomo."}
{"text":"Flautas with guacamole were excellent..it all could have used a little bit more salt or seasoning though...could be my Californian palate tho."}
{"text":"It was March 17th, St. Patrick's Day. And like every good Irish guy, I decided to wear my pride and do what comes naturally: eat. Only, rather than walk the 3 blocks to Seamus, I instead called in an enchilada order to Los Dos Molinos. And this was after I read some of these reviews. I'm quite daring. You'd think I worked for the IRS.  After hearing horror stories about the crazy hot and spicy red chile, I settled on ordering that for my lunch. Apparently, LDM has either tamed down the flame, because I was able to eat the entire meal without incident. Even the following day I wasn't getting afterburners ignited. So much for heat. But, the flavors were good, the price was great, and the adventure of jaywalking across Washington tied the whole experience nicely together. I'm looking forward to actually getting to eat inside this location, and not just rail it to a fro.  A solid three stars."}
{"text":"If you are one of those people who cannot eat cilantro, this is *not* the place for you. We were told, after one in our party had to turn his order back in, that cilantro is used in all their dishes, even though only some of the items on the menu list it. (To the restaurant's credit, he was not charged.) While the prices might be considered high, the servings are massive. The green chile stew is enough for two, is definitely spicy, and is served in a unique way with rice and beans off to the side in the same bowl. The pork was a bit fatty and could have been better trimmed. The decor at this location is nothing to write home about. Probably won't return, but for the most part , the food was okay for those who could eat it. I wish Mexican restaurants would be specific when cilantro is used because those with that particular fat/enzyme reaction suffer until the effect wears off (usually in an hour or two)."}
{"text":"Love the original Los Dos!  They have solid food and good service.  This place is always very busy and noisy inside the restaurant.  Definitely not a place for a quiet dinner out.  I make it here a couple times a year and it is always fantastic.  Love the carnitas and salsa!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Great service, great food, great margaritas....perfect!!!  Chile Platter was so good, carnitas and adobo ribs were all awesome!  Will definitely be back...soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  I can't believe this place is sitting at 3 stars.  Makes me realize the rating system is not a perfect science.    I am told that this is \"New Mexico\" cuisine, meaning they use Hatch chiles in most of their dishes.  Whatever they do, it works.  The two house salsa were spicy and flavorful.  This was followed with a carnitas dip and pork tamales that were fantastic.  Tamales are typically 80% corn and 20% meat.  These were 80% meat.  And the pork was slow roasted, tender and delicious.  I had the Carne Adovada burrito, which was chunks of pork marinated in red chili.  I was completely stuffed but the food was so good I powered through like I was in a competition.  Everything was homemade.  The sour cream was fresh and had spices in it.  I also had a fresh fruit margarita that was perfect.  To top this off, they were playing oldies on the radio (ex. The Four Tops) that were jamming.  Much better than the typically mariachi band crap.  I live in LA so I feel like I know Mexican food.  But this blew me away.  It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"The carne adavado is the best you'll get anywhere. It's about an hour drive for me to come here but the folks here make you feel like family."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great service!! Spicy and tasty!! Margaritas are some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I grew up on Los Dos Molinos: hot and spicy Mexican food with distinctly southwestern flavors. It's one of my go-to, tippy top stops for Mexican food in the Valley.  But nothing beats bringing your parents and boyfriend here when y'all visit Arizona for the first time together, and watching with horror as sweat beads near his temples from the salsa alone.  \"Is it all going to be like this?\" he'll ask.  \"Yeah,\" you'll say, as you hand him a delicious margarita, knowing all will be sweaty and well."}
{"text":"I have no idea how I lived here so long and have never eaten at this location. It seems sacrilegious. I even worked at the Pointe when it was located at South Mountain for many years and still never went to this Phoenix staple. I was determined to go today since I had an event nearby.    If you like Tex Mex then you might not agree with my three stars and I say go ahead and give it 4 or 5 stars- probably one of the better ones in town. Wow, they even won a Zagat. I'm impressed.   Pros-   *Spicy-- Yum *Chile Rellenos- Huge meal for A La Carte, but that could be a con- too much food. They were tasting okay. Spicy yes but you could still taste the ingredients. That can be a trick in itself to get it right. *Great salsa/hot sauce- I did not find this salsa very hot though, weird. I liked the salsa a lot. I worked at a lot of Mexican restaurants in my day and I am picky in this regard. *Guacamole is not that bad for a Tex Mex restaurant. Not the best but good.  *Wonderful funky decor. It is like a mini Mexican village. Very eclectic.  *Carlos is amazing! * I liked that they serve water in actual beer glasses and left me an entire pitcher of water for myself. It was very hot today and their food is pretty spicy.  * Their bathrooms are cool.   Cons-  * The door was locked or hard to open when I got there. Good thing I called and did not leave. Since I was the only one there at the time I thought they were closed.  *the girl who sat me and first served me was not very friendly *far away in the middle of nowhere, at least for me.  *very spicy if you are a lightweight. lol I am not but if you are, beware. Please, ask the server what you should order instead. I overheard him tell others they do have mild choices.  * I found this restaurant to be very expensive browsing the menu.   I asked about the gift shop and Carlos laughed at me. He then told me it was closed 14 years ago. I swear I read somewhere they had a gift shop. Oh well. Ha-ha to me. The birthday gift has to be purchased elsewhere, \"friend who will remain nameless for now.\""}
{"text":"I've decided to up my star rating of Los Dos Molinos after last night's visit.  The additional star is warranted!    The Ahwatukee LDM is not some fancy, tries too hard, chic place to eat.  The decor could use a spruce up, for sure.  The food, though, is phenomenal.    Last night I ate the machaca burro with green chiles, accompanied by black beans and rice.  You have to specify what type of beans you like, or you will get standard pinto.  The pinto beans are made with lard, so they're a no go for me.  Of course, I hear they are delicious!    The machaca was moist and flavorful.  It was almost like eating a spicy pot roast.  The black beans were very delicious, leading me to wonder what they put in them!  The rice was bland, which is how I like spanish-style rice.  I am not a fan of overtly-tomato based rice flavorings, so this was perfect.  There are few offerings on the menu for a child's palate.  My daughter ordered black beans and a corn cheese crisp, of which she ate about half.  For $5 for the cheese crisp, I feel it was pricey.  I think they could have given her two.  There was a substantial portion of beans for $2.50.  I would like to see a kids' menu, since the place is located in Kid Central.    Our service was great, by a waiter who we overheard was majoring in nutrition.  He was very attentive and on top of everything.  We never went without drink refills (very important when food is this spicy).  Let me reiterate what I said in my prior review. Los Dos Molinos serves EXTREMELY spicy food.  They do not serve food for the average American palate.  While I actually enjoy eating very hot food, I think those who are not used to eating HOT Hatch chiles would not be able to handle it.  Once again, I've had a fantastic meal at Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"I love it hot and spicy and this place did not disappoint. Their beef machaca is amazing! This was a recommendation from my Phoenix family and friends and it was the best. Our go-to for Mexican food when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Come here for New Mexico style Mexican cuisine.  Think hot hot hot.  Red or green.  Pick your poison.  The rellenos are great.  I have no idea what WM is talking about - as far as I know there is only one other Los Dos is the Phoenix area.  And overpriced?  Did we go to the same restaurant?"}
{"text":"The only place where spicy is worth it! I never eat spicy food but the food here is so wonderful, I can overlook the heat. For those who are afraid of spice, a glass of milk with the food will suffice."}
{"text":"Wow! This is the place to get an awesome unique dining experience and some amazing spicy food.  My girlfriends and I came here for a girls night out and the staff was so friendly and inviting.  We ordered some Sangritas and they were great.  The chips were warm and salsa spicy, just the way I love it.  For dinner I ordered the adovada ribs... Sour cream on the side.  The server suggested I tried half regular beans and half spicy (since I said I love beans and didn't feel like rice) and the beans were delicious.  One friend ordered a red chile enchilada- I had a bite and was tempted to order one to take home for lunch the next day.  There was a great birthday celebration at the table next to us.  My only regret was not leaving room for dessert.  Meal portions are great. Staff is friendly. Drinks are refreshing. Ambiance is fun.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my all-time favorite restaurants in Phoenix. It has a really authentic new-Mexican ambiance (and yes, I've been to New Mexican restaurants in New Mexico).  There can be a long wait, but it's worth it.  I always get the carne adovada chimichange with red sauce. Oh, so freaking good. It is spicy as heck, but the flavor is just so deep and perfect. The salsa is also hot, so make sure you've got your drink before digging in.  The Central Ave location has the authentic ambiance, but both locations have the same great food."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch ordered a chimichanga took a hour just for a cheese Crisp when food came out chimichanga was all mushy customer services is horrible didn't get drink refills had to stop another service to get a refill I'm your in a hurry go else where    But manger took care of issues chips and salsa are good so was the cheese crisp"}
{"text":"I love this place and come here every time I fly into town from Seattle. The food is blazing hot and I mean from the peppers. The tamales are absolutely amazing and the adobe pork and ribs are as good as you will ever experience. There is truly nothing like this place."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Service is ok, nothing to complain about but not always friendly.Generally a good atmosphere, nothing fancy, hole-in-wall type of feel in a very good way.  Garlic pork is magic!  Margaritas get you hammered!  Job done!!"}
{"text":"We had terrible service here, we were there for 20 minutes before someone took our drink order, we ordered our food and everything when someone did come by. It took 30 minutes for the cheese crisp to come out and another 30 for food. I was disappointed cuz everyone said their service is so good! Maybe it was an off night, but it did not make us want to go back unfortunately :("}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food I've ever had! From start to finish. Authentic chips/salsa /margaritas.  I had garlic pork with homemade ( the best I've ever had) tortillas and rice and beans. My wife had the No. 1.  Hard shell( homemade shell) taco and cheese enchiladas and a side Chile relleno. The chili's come from New Mexico! The margaritas are punch bowl size. Wife could barely lift the glass and it knocked her for a loop! I had two which was probably a mistake. Needed a siesta but somehow mad it to the spring training game. Real authentic lime taste. Finished with the flan. Past reviews complained about poor service. Quality food takes time. Rather wait a little for great food. Family owned."}
{"text":"I had been hearing of this place forever and finally had the opportunity to check it out - definitely glad I did!  The food is very authentic, but a bit heavy for my liking.  The queso dip was lack luster, but the rest was good."}
{"text":"Authentic New Mexico-style Mexican food is not easy to come by outside of New Mexico and this is as close as it comes in Arizona! Family-run Los Dos Molinos features the best Chile Rellonos and Soppapillas in Arizona, great Margaritas by the pitcher (like God intended) and homemade salsas to die for... It's not Albuquerque, but this is the best New Mexico-style Mexican food I've had this side off the Rio Grande!"}
{"text":"Our group of Three ladies and myself had a great lunch today at LOS DOS MOLINAS on south Central in Phoenix.   We started with their Kick A. Margaritas which it does not get better than this.  With our drinks we had lots of chips and super red and green chili sauce.   I had the Blue cornTamales with extra beans.  The ladies Dina and Karen had Talapia fish tacos.  One lady had Combo Talapia Fish Tacos , and a green corn tamales.  This was Carla who was our driver.  Her drink sadly was diet coke.   The food was well cooked, fresh and very, very good.  I can not wait to return as this is one of my top favorite restaurants in Phoenix Metro.   Manager Dominique and waiter Carlos do on o.utstand job in making everyone happy.   Try this restaurant.  You will not be disappointed.  It is Outstanding.  All my guests agreed.  sincerely,  Eddie Altman  Jr."}
