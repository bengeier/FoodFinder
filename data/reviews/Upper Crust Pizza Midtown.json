{"text":"The WORST service I have encountered in a long time. The service is nonexistent and worse they are rude. I guess customers are a hassle. The food is decent but not worth the hassle. I would suggest anywhere else. I won't return."}
{"text":"First time we went, one gentleman was very nice and service was good. I think those days are gone. Wait staff is rude, when they have any. We just tried to go and there was one person behind the bar and that was it.  Disappointing. Very close to my house, around the corner, and I will never go again. Food is okay but not worth dealing with the bad staff, unfortunately. Same issue when it was Buffalo, too."}
{"text":"All these one stars because e your kid can't sit on the Patio ? get over your self . Pizza is Fab"}
{"text":"I'm still not sure about this place.  We've been twice for dinner: the first time the food was wonderful but the service was lousy.  We went back for the food and were sorely disappointed.  The pizza we ordered was paper thin in the center and so dry- think pizza chips.  The toppings were sparse and poorly distributed.  I'm vegetarian and my husband is not: we ordered a large pizza with half mushroom and half sausage (the same pizza we ordered our first time).  There were only 2 pieces I could eat out of the large pie because whoever made the pizza basically threw sausage everywhere.  Our server was very nice and offered to have the pizza remade but by that time we were just ready to get home.  He also offered a beer or dessert on the house which was a nice gesture.  So this second experience was a complete 180 from our first visit- now we have yuck food but great service.

We will likely return because the server gave us a coupon for a free pizza on our next visit..update to follow...maybe."}
{"text":"Got to this location about12:30 today, no other customers. Guy at the bar told us to sit anywhere. Another group arrives behind us. They are seated and given menus.  My partner says WTF! We're outta here. Very disrespectful! First impressions are everything. We like to frequent local businesses;  we live in the neighborhood, less than 2 blocks away.  We won't be returning.  I heard the owners are the same that owned the previous restaurant Wild Game Grill.  Maybe they should try another line of work."}
{"text":"Took my family of 4 on a Wednesday for dinner. We weren't allowed to sit on the patio and from the looks of it they needed the business.
They told us it was part of the bar. Happy Hour applied in different areas of the building.
If your gonna use the word Pizza in your business name they you better expect family's
to come thru the door. So being kid friendly is probably something they need to work on.

The food was ok.. nothing to come back for. This place is only good for adults and date nights.
If pizza is your thing."}
{"text":"We didn't even get to eat here! It says that they are open until 10, we walked in at about 9:15. We noticed no one else was there and asked if they were still serving, didn't want to be 'those people'. A gentleman assured us it was fine and to have a seat wherever. We sat down and a very rushed server comes up to us and says, \"do you know what you want?\". We didn't even have menus...he handed us three menus for four people and told us we had 10 minutes to order. We felt so uncomfortable that even though we had taken an Uber there we opted to go somewhere that was willing to serve us properly. Ended up at Sushiholic- very good and they have evening happy hour. Having family that just moved to the neighborhood it is disappointing to have to mark this one off the list."}
{"text":"Great pizza in central Phoenix.  Best happy hour and lunch specials.
Glad it's in the neighborhood.  Watched football there and they even bought 
back the smoked wings."}
{"text":"This place was amazing when we moved into the area a couple months ago and we were there 3 times the first week. So it was assumed it would be our new neighborhood hang out. However the food and experience has gone down hill in a hurry. They changed the way they do things, started skimping on cheese and portion size and started charging extra for every little thing. It's really a shame. Even the lack of attention the wait staff pays to the customers. It is all just disappointing. It's a shame I have to wonder how much longer it will be here :-("}
{"text":"Not great, definitely better places to go in the area.  If they're still making money at 50% off(Yelp deal)  it should tell you something."}
{"text":"Great pizza and salads.  Pasta is also on the menu.  Impressive wine and beer selection at reasonable prices, and a full bar as well.  Decor is a modern take on the classic trattoria, with checked tablecloths and cloth napkins making the restaurant area both homey and slightly more elegant than your typical pizza place.  The pizza is New York style, and somehow very tasty without being greasy.  We had a sliced meatball and onion pizza which I highly recommend. A nice Mediterranean salad, and boneless wings which were light and very tasty rounded out the meal.  Upper crust is a great addition to the central Phoenix casual Italian restaurant scene.  We can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Whenever we check out a pizza place, we try The Classic first to see how well they do it- Pepperoni Pizza. We were NOT disappointed. Reasonably priced, good happy hour, comfortable atmosphere. We also got wings, which we thought were amazing (and this is noteworthy because I'm not the BIGGEST wing fan). What a find!"}
{"text":"Restaurant looks nice and has very nice bathrooms; however, that was the highlight of the experience.  We went on a Friday evening, and the restaurant was half full.  We waited to be seated for about 5 minutes and once finally recognized, were told it would be a couple  of minutes.  After waiting another 5 minutes, sat at the bar and were ignored by the bartender who totaled up receipts and completely  ignored our presence even though no one else was at the bar.  Finally left in exasperation; don't bother."}
{"text":"Apparently this business removed my first review! I did not know they could do that?               O stars!!! This food is horrible!
We took out food that was awful. Cold, mushy and tasted horrible. We asked for a refund
and was advised we would but after 3 phone calls and an i don't care attitude i had too dispute charge with my bank. The management and owners were rude and could care less.
The inside of the restaurant is very depressing as well. The other bad reviews are justified. We will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"Forced us to move from the dining area, because a member of our party wasn't 21. Then took away the happy hour because we were no longer in the bar dining area. And there was not a single other person there. We left. Terrible, never going there again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was normal. Service was great. Food was awful. Nothing outstanding enough to return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here fora late lunch on a weds afternoon around 2. Very quiet obviously not their rush hour but atmosphere was very inviting and relaxing. Pasta with meat sauce was on point! Potential for a great date night. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, pizza, smoked wings, and antipasti salad!  Very happy with the beer and wine selections.  Quality cheese and meats.  Good place to watch sports."}
{"text":"It was the worst service ever. It's run by a bunch of inexperienced kids. Very overly expensive. And they need to know the difference between black olives and Kalamata olives I'll never be back there again!"}
{"text":"I'm a picky pizza eater. I'm a huge NJ pizza gal, I wouldn't compare it to jersey pizza, but wow it was tasty. My friend and I shared the small house salad which was no ordinary salad, mushrooms, tomatoes, roasted red peppers, olives with an amazing Italian dressing. I could've had that as a meal myself with a protein. 
We ordered the veggie pizza and added ricotta. This was a basil pesto sauce, I'm usually a red sauce girl....so pleasantly surprised when I ate my entire half. When my friend didn't finish hers bc she was stuffed, the owner asked if we wanted it boxed, she said no, I said hold on sister I'm having that for dinner. That good!
So our kids were at another table, they ordered pasta and pepperoni pizza, my son said 2nd best pizza he's ever had. He's used to Jersey style, so high compliments. Also they brought out dough for the kids to play with...bonus! They ended it with the pizookie, huge hot chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. I'm done... Delish!"}
{"text":"Great find. The food was amazing. Our server, Will, recommended the bone in wings over the boneless. We still went with the boneless with the teriyaki hot sauce. They were delicious! We can't wait to try the bone in. Will was prompt, attentive and funny. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fried mozzarella and spinach dip was phenomenal. We went during there happy hour they kind na under staff but I'm impressed with the bartender he handle almost everything!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the wings, which were tender and saucy. In fact, they should consider only selling wings (reason for 3rd star).

This was our second visit because we forgot to apply the groupon at the first visit. At that time, we ordered pizzas. The meaty pizza  was good. Unfortunately, the veggie one was mushy and salty. 

On our return visit, we ordered and enjoyed  the wings again. This time, we skipped the mediocre pizza and decided to try the calzone with spinach and mushrooms.

The crust was delicious, but the inside of the huge calzone was filled predominantly with ricotta cheese and a few chopped pieces of canned mushroom and spinach. This created a bland filling with a consistency similar to marshmallow fluff. I wish we had taken a picture. 

The staff recommended that if we order the calzone again, to \"request a normal amount of ricotta.\" Seems like it might be more helpful to include a description in the menu if this is the default. 

Glad we are done with the groupon..."}
{"text":"I have to start with the service was horrible. My sister in law took a sip of her husbands Coke and the waitress came over and said if you drink out of his cup I will have to charge you for two drinks. Then changed her story and said we have have cameras and we are watching you. After that she approached my sister in law and screamed at her. I wish I was lying, however I am saddened by the fact that we received such horrible service. The waitress was rude. I will never come here again. Please save your money. We did find a sweet new pizza place on 37th Street and Indian School Called My slice of the Pie. GO to that place they treat you well."}
{"text":"Happy Hour: 4-7
Sports bar vibe and decent food. 

Had the Upper Trio pizza. Meats were of good quality. I'm picky about meatballs and sausage, and this place delivered. I'll try the meatball sliders next time. The crust was a melt on your mouth Brooklyn-style with a dusting of corn meal on the semolina. 

We also had smoked wings. They were similar to those from Wild Game, so we were pleased. Sauce was mediocre, but since the smoked wings were good, the sauce mattered minimally. And since they're smoked, they were thoroughly cooked  

Downsides: veggies tasted like the fridge and the place is really dead. They could stand the have a 'cheap beer happy hour' problem. 

Update: food is still pretty awesome. HH beers fair, and service still meh. COME EAT THE FOOD B4 ITS GONE!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here for the first time on 2/29/2016 around 2:45pm.  The parking lot located behind the building is large and the handicap parking is set up nicely with security camera shining right down on the parking area. The entry door is easily accessible and very wide, but blank with no name on it.  I thought that was strange.  Once we opened the door however, we were impressed.  Very clean and spacious with plenty of big screen TV's, plenty of seating, an outdoor patio, and a long bar.  We ordered the meat lovers 18\" pizza and 2 sodas.  The waitress/bartender was working alone, but it was slow at this time of day so she was able to stay on top of things.  The pizza was absolutely delicious!!!  We ate most of it and took 2 slices home.  I went to use the bathroom and noticed the motion sensing lights as I approached the bathroom door, then the same thing once I entered the bathroom.  Just make sure if you go there and it's a slow day, bring your phone in the bathroom with you.  If you spend a few too many minutes in there the lights will time out and it gets real dark.  That was the only sucky part of the visit. I give the place 5 stars for cleanliness, portion size, speed, value, and accessibility.  We will be dining here again!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for lunch on a Friday. The patio is super comfy and relaxed feeling. We were greeted right away and the server was great. We did wait quite a while for our food but definitely well worth it. We ordered the buffalo chicken pizza which was great along with the focaccia with cheese. Great beer selection too!
Definitely a returning customer!"}
{"text":"Wonderful wine list. Very reasonable. Great hidden spot. Spacious patio. Food was delicious and portions were huge. Everyone took home leftovers! Lots of tvs for sports games. Takes away from sit down dining but great for watching the big game at the bar. Our server, Alex, was friendly and attentive. Lovely experience"}
{"text":"Dinner and drinks tonight. Had a good time listening to the rain and enjoying pizza and beer. Casey and Tim were great.  They were personable and offered great suggestions. Food was good and beer was cold!"}
{"text":"Incredible pizza and wings....total 5 stars on the grub for sure. It's not your average pizza joint. Staff is really friendly and place is clean. We are quickly making this one of our go-to spots."}
{"text":"The Yelp deal they have right now is awesome. Spend $10 for $20 worth of food. My husband and I went and split a pizza and didn't have to spend another dime! (except for tip). The pizza was great and so was the service."}
{"text":"This was one of the best pizzas we've had in Phoenix!!!!!  Great staff as well steered us towards some local favorites that really paid off!!!!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for a quick lunch here -- quite impressed. I love the patio area. Calzone and Buffalo Chicken pizza we shared were delish! I hope this place makes a big splash and succeeds. I look forward to a return trip with friends. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Used a Groupon to have lunch here with a buddy. Surprised at it being mostly empty. Pleasant enough surroundings. Service was friendly and attentive. Pizza was tasty. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I am revising my review from 1 to 4 stars. I have been to this place twice now, once with a friend and once with my child. I was upset originally because I couldn't sit on the patio with my child during the day. I came here tonight with my child. Upon sitting down the waiter gave us a little ball of dough for my daughter to make a pizza crust. He said he would put it in the oven. However, she literally played with this ball of dough the entire time we were there. It allowed me to enjoy my meal while she enjoyed our time there. This is a genius move! The pizza is truly the best I've had in the valley, so yummy. You will be VERY happy with the food. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE let me sit on the patio with my kid during the day so I can give you five stars."}
{"text":"Seriously good food at this pizza place in Midtown!  The bartenders were so welcoming and nice, the atmosphere was nice, but the food stole the show.  We ordered a calzone with meatballs and a stromboli with ham and were in heaven...so ridiculously good!  I am going to crave this place every once in a while and know we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and wine bar. It's clean, classy and affordable. The crowd ranges from hipsters to business pros, but they are pleasant. Great craft beer and nice wine selection. They have football on all screens in Sunday. The waiter gave up his table (us) to reseat us just so we could save a few bucks and get happy hour. We were so happy with the service we have him. Good tip even though we weren't in his section. Give it a try at least once, this is a very enjoyable place to have a snack and a few drinks"}
{"text":"New spot, must check it out. Pizza is thin crust and wings are great. The portions are family size! Decor is great! The staff are very welcoming great customer service! The restaurant is divided into dinning and bar experience which I loved. 
Will return again"}
{"text":"5 Stars in every possible aspect. If I owned a pizza restaurant, I'd hope mine was exactly like this one. I stopped in and ordered stromboli and the personal size Hawaiian pizza. I don't value service very much but it should be noted that I was looked in the eye, smiled at, and felt that they valued me as an individual. The atmosphere phenomenal. From the big windows to the outside seating to the nice bar with 3 big tv's. You could watch a sports game here or the Oscar's which was on while I waited. Then the main event. The pizza is exactly what I want in a pizza. Thin, flakey, buttery crust so I don't have too many carbs. Then piled high with delicious toppings including the best cheese I remember having. And the stromboli was also packed with pepperoni. EAT HERE. THE END."}
{"text":"So the Ambiance is GREAT, food is AMAZING and HUGE portions.  The only issue i see here is the lack of customers!! I think a new marketing campaign is in order.  You cant even tell if they are open.  However, in the mean time

VISIT THIS PLACE!!! 

We want it to stay open for a long time."}
{"text":"The pizza is well done. The crust is something from the east coast. The fried mozzarella is a must! Also, a wide selection of wine with over ten beers on tap."}
{"text":"Great place to eat good pizza and get great service! I love there appatizers and they have good deals during happy hour. Don't forget to eat the Upper Crust!"}
{"text":"Loved the fried mozzarella. A must try. Pizzas are delicious, large, and a good value."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings on this one but will not be returning.  We were overcharged on four items we ordered is the reason for not returning - imagine they do that with half the customers daily - what a rip off!  I have no problem paying more - just let me know that I am going to be paying it.  Also, happy hour is only in certain spots of the restaurant - not where we sat.  The food was ok - nothing great and nothing awful, it was all edible.  They were extremely friendly and the place was clean and there were a lot of televisions to watch the games on."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday since we are new to the neighborhood.  The wings were great. We had the smoked honey-hot and they were perfect. Lots of smokey sweet flavor.  We also tried the Hawaiian pizza and it was also delicious.  The pizza had a light and crispy crust and it was perfect.  Our server was very friendly and did a great job taking care of us.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service and ambience. The pizza will leave you wanting more! Get the medium wings- they're a must! The small salad can be shared between 2 and the dressing is delicious. Thanks Upper Crust! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"After having been here a second visit, I think my first review may have been a bit harsh. We came here this past weekend to watch the hockey game, and had another groupon. The food was much better this time around. I still don't think I would pick to come here over another pizza place in my area, but its not as terrible as I thought it was the first trip!"}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious and fresh ! Service i was not to satisfied, i been there couple of times around 9pm and the server/bartender seems like he always has a hotdate waiting for him . Always  when we get there he tries to rush us to order and points out ( the kitchen is closing in 20 minutes. We work in the industry and we never tall our customers hurry up order eat and leave i have to go home ."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome. We've only been twice but both times the pizza was delicious, filling and very reasonably priced.

The service was ABOVE excellent and we are happy  to make the 25 mile commute from Scottsdale for such great service. 

We will continue to frequent here as often as possible! Thanks for such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Food is good, turn around in receiving orders is fairly quick.  Ordered the pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza.  Came with thin crust which is exactly what I like.  They plenty of beer on tap including Dos Equis and Blue Moon.  Service was a little detached in the beginning.  We got our drinks and our bartender/server disappeared for 10-15 minutes and it was dead inside.  Love the location as its close to home.  Will return soon, thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to have a pizza place that's really good right by my house!

I was sad when Wild Game closed but this is a great fit for the neighborhood and I have no complaints on the food or service. 

The mozzarella balls were awesome! Pizza and calzones sent us home full and satisfied. 

Eating the pizza now as breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is truly kid friendly. The food was awesome as well! They brought some dough over to my three year old to make whatever she wanted. She made an \"angry bird\" and they cooked it for her and returned it. In the words of my 3 year old, the angry bird was \"yummy.\" I loved it! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"They have amazing thin crust pizza and wings! And a wonderful selection of beer and wine. A lot of people are complaining because the bar and patio areas are 21+, it's a benefit to me. :) my only complaint is our last waiter wasn't able to provide wine advice since he was 19, but he let me sample something I thought I would like!"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous. Had pizza, salad, dip. All were to die for. Service was great and food was quick. Wish we lived closer."}
{"text":"Wow! Completely impressed. Walked in a little skeptical - parking lot was empty on a football Sunday and the first thing that crosses your mind for a sports bar is \"hmmmm...what's wrong that there's no one here on a Sunday?\" But, the service was good, and the food was pretty darn awesome. Had the stuffed mushrooms (super cheesy and delicious), bruschetta (balsamic tomato goodness that I kept the sauce to dip my pizza crust in for later), smoked Cajun dry rub wings (smoky, flavorful, and not greasy or messy), and their veggie pizza. Pizza crust is crispy, thin, yet doughy - super delicious. Pizza is never my go-to...never - but I found this crave-able. Oh yeah and if you dip the crust ends in the bruschetta sauce...it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Four of us visited last night for the first time to watch the playoff game. Lots of TVs which is nice but the sound was a little blaring- which I guess isn't unheard of for a sports bar. We got a pepperoni pizza which was DELICIOUS- surprisingly good. Some of the best pizza we've ever had. The house salad was also really great. The house white wine we all split from a carafe which was cheap and hit the spot. Service was attentive and friendly. The bathrooms were impressive for a sports bar. Will definitely be back for pizza and wine!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and was looking forward to non-chain Pizza.  The reviews at the time were very promising.  We were disappointed.  The pizza was delivered with burned edges and cold."}
{"text":"Evan & Tim gave us EXCELLENT customer service even though it was 25 minutes to close. Definitely a longer review to follow -   the food matches the service. Many thanks to the kitchen staff."}
{"text":"Hands down the best New York style pizza restaurant in Phoenix. Loved the food and beer selection and looks amazing inside. I got the veggie which was unique and way more delicious than the competition NY Pizza Dept. up the street. Can't wait to come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon and was pleasantly surprised! The wine and beer list are awesome. A lot to chose from! We've been here a few times over the past few weeks and couldn't be happier with the food and service. Evan is an awesome waiter. Always attentive and happy. We've had a few appetizers, medium wings, and a different pizza each time we've come here. So far everything has been our favorite! There is seating outside, inside dining, and at the bar. Just remember to park in the back!"}
{"text":"Two stars because of the good pizza, otherwise one. If this place wasn't in our neighborhood and conveniently close to us, we wouldn't go out of our way to eat there. Well, at least we won't anymore. The place is first and foremost a restaurant, not a bar. Note the name... \"Upper Crust Pizza\", not Upper Crust Bar. Yes, there is a bar there, too, but there's far more table seating than bar space. We were there at happy hour, and we were the only people in the place, a red flag for sure, but that's beside the point. We sat at a table in a section clearly separated from the bar by a partition-type wall. Long story short... had to leave because almost-adult minors aren't allowed to sit there per the owner's discretion, not by law. Maybe they don't want to give the impression that this is a family place and are trying to cultivate a hipper, night-time, sports-bar motif (about 20 TVs fighting for your attention). But given the fact the the place is almost always nearly empty when we go there, it seems that some flexibility in seating policy is in order. We thought the patio might be an option for us, but an unpleasant one given the proximity to Thomas Road traffic flying by about 15 feet away. But we were even denied that by our server. Fortunately we knew of a great pizza restaurant (also with a bar) not far away that had no silly seating restrictions, and yet somehow still manages to create a cool atmosphere in which to eat great pizza. That other place is 5-star for sure."}
{"text":"They have great food, best bruschetta in town! but they really need to hire more employees. The last time I went here we were told it would be an hour before we would be seated and 75% of the restaurant was empty. There was only one guy working and he was running around like a chicken with no head. We ended up leaving to Oregano's to celebrate my brothers birthday instead. Was really disappointed."}
{"text":"Still awesome. Super friendly staff and great food. Try the Stromboli. It's breathtaking."}
{"text":"We tried Upper Crust Pizza last night for the first time.  We used to come here when it was Wild Game Grill and loved it back then.  When you walk in the door, the restaurant is divided into an upper end dining area and a bar area which I really liked.  We opted to sit in the casual bar area.    There were several TVs on all with different sporting events.  This is a nice touch if you like sports.  I like that there are phone charging stations along the wall.  The beer and wine choices were amazing.  I think even the most eclectic drinker will find something to enjoy.  The service was very good and we were well taken care of.  My partner and I both ordered wings.  I got the orange zest and he got the hot barbeque.  My wings were a little over cooked but not bad.  His wings had a strong vinegar taste.  This isn't uncommon in southern barbeque recipes but it didn't really seem to fit the taste of a chicken wing.  I think it would have been great on some pulled pork.  All in all, it wasn't a bad experience and we will probably try it again."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza and wings, take-out took longer than expected. You have to wait for one of the bar tenders to free up to pay for the order, which if they are busy could take 5 minutes or so. The pizza cust had a slightly salty/buttery taste, which I liked. The wings were meaty, next time I will ask for them crispy."}
{"text":"I love there upper trio!!!! Best pizza ever also there staff is so chill and welcoming. Much check it out if you love flavored meaty pizza. There ranch also is one of a kind. Don't dare forget to eat here without the ranch!"}
{"text":"After driving past daily by this restaurant, my man and I finally decided to stop by for lunch. As soon as we drove to the back of the restaurant, we saw a pretty spacious and comfortable parking lot. 

We were friendly greeted as we walked in, sat at spacious little booth, and menus were given to us. The place has a mixture of decor, kind of classic Italian w/ the plaid table clothes, and modern with TV's all around (not overwhelming). They have a pretty spacious bar, that we will definitely try soon for their DAILY Happy Hour specials. 

We looked at the menu, and they have some pretty decent lunch specials for pizza and wings; we were promptly asked if we were ready to order, and we decided to order 1 pound of bone-in wings with HOT sauce, and a 8\" pizza with pepperoni, both dishes had a side salad. The food was ready in about 15 mins, it was pretty fast, so of course, I was happy since it was my lunch hour.

The pizza was good, perfect amount of sauce, thin, crispy (maybe a little too crispy for some) but to me it was very good; it was accompanied by a small house salad which had a mixture of red bell peppers, mushrooms, and red onions, very yummy. The wings were saucy, tender and meaty, about 8-10 wings (1 pound), and accompanied by a LARGE side of delicious ranch. Wings also came with a Mediterranean side salad that was AMAZING! 

We enjoyed our food, we were stuffed, and we paid under $25.00, not bad for a nice little restaurant. The service was really good, it wasn't too busy, there were about another 4 couples having lunch, one waitress, but she was very good and courteous. 

They have a large selection of alcoholic drinks, we are definitely going back to Happy Hour in the near future."}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter and we really enjoyed the atmosphere upon entering.  Our server was better than fantastic!  We had a hard time making a decision on what we wanted to order and our server was patient and helpful with recommendations.  

We ordered half Margherita pizza and half Veggie pizza.  Both were amazingly delish!  We couldn't decide which one we preferred since they both were great.  In addition, we ordered the small Mediterranean salad to share and it was incredible.  Super fresh ingredients used for both the pizza and salad.

My daughter was so impressed with the food and service that she plans to bring a few of her friends there to celebrate a birthday since it isn't too far of a drive from ASU.  

Highly recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I went there and their happy hour is amazing. Great prices with huge portions. I'm big on customer service and that was amazing as well. The bruschetta is great and flavorful, the bread it comes with is a perfect pair. Will and Tim were great, if I could give this place 10 stars I would. 

Regards,
Will"}
{"text":"We decided to give it another try.  It was worse than the first time.  The food is delicious however the service is bad and the employees are rude.  We waited over 20 minutes to get tea and water and about an hour for our food.  Also we were charged for a side of ranch and Bleu cheese and we ordered 2 lbs of wings and a personal pizza.  The sides were small.  This time I don't think we will be back.  We might do carryout on a Tues for their 1 topping pizza for 10.00.  Otherwise they are pricey and not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wow what a amazing place to eat! Hidden gem 26th st and Thomas. The wings with medium sauce are tasty! The pizza is thin crust and I don't feel like a carb blog rest of the day. The establishment is clean and the atmosphere is nice with outdoor seating. Plenty of TVs to watch the sport games as well."}
{"text":"So, my first encounter with Upper Crust was back at the Yelp Pley date when they brought those delicious meatballs to sample... I can still imagine how they tasted all those years ago. I have since been to the other location and was excited to hear they were opening close to me! So I convinced a friend to give this place a try one Friday night and we get there and there are literally no cars in the lot. I called to make sure they were open, and they were. We were a little freaked out, but decided to go in anyway. You know how it's generally awkward to be the only customers in a restaurant... well, this was definitely how it felt here. We awkwardly listened to the bartender talking about tip etiquette with the waitress... oy. Anyway, we ended up getting a calzone with meatball and pepperoni and some beer. The calzone took a bit to come out, but, when it did, it looked amazing. This thing was pretty large (I think we got the 16 inch) and covered with parm on top. It tasted pretty good, but definitely less cheesy than your typical calzone. I liked it, but felt it was WAY overpriced, it was over 20$. I usually go to Pizza Heaven for calzones and pay around 12$ for the same thing. I think this place is going to struggle at this price point in this location, but I wish them well."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place so on a dead Sunday night my friend and I decided to check it out. As soon as we walked in, we walked over to sit in the booth dining section; the waitress told us the section was CLOSED & only the patio or bar was open. So we sat outside. 

The waitress took 10 mins to get us menus and drinks. Then another 15 mins to get our order. We ordered a family salad and pizza. The salad came out in 12 mins and the pizza in 55 mins. At the 40 min mark, the waitress mentioned she can see the pizza coming out in 5 mins. Literally almost and hour to get our pizza, hence there were no other customers but us. Our pizza came out cold. The waitress didn't check on us for at least 20 mins, at that point there was no reason to get a remake of the pizza. Even though the pizza was cold, it did have a lot of flavor. Hence why I gave 2 stars.

When we were cashing out, I asked her why the inside dining section was closed off? She responded \"I'm too lazy to walk from the kitchen to the farthest dining section. Talk about rude and lazy.

So 2 stars for delicious COLD pizza. Bad & lazy service. Not sure if I will be back or just get take out."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Pizza and boneless wings were cooked to perfection. I only wished I lived closer. I will defiantly recommend this place. Check out their lunch specials and happy hour"}
{"text":"Sevice was good. Ambience is good. Food was super disappointing.   Boneless wings in honey hot sauce were super dry  chicken pieces and lacked flavor. Bland and blech but ate it anyway.  House Salad was too oily with wilty lettuce and also lacked zest and flavor for an italian dressing. Was offered tobasco and the bottle he brought to me was dark brownish and looked past due... didn't even know tobasco could get that dark.  Pizza looked and smelled good but we are avoiding bread. Maybe we just ordered the worst dishes on the menu but have no interest  in trying this place  again. Too many other places to try."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Planned out our night for pizza on our way home. Website says open till 11pm, bought the Yelp promotion. Called at 10:34 and Tim said NO.  Very upset at the lack of communication in the website and the horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great price. Clean bathrooms. Nice restaurant. I would go back. Good menu."}
