{"text":"This place has everything you need for a Middle Eastern meal. They also have a small restaurant if you don't feel like cooking tonight you could always do takeout. The selection is great and the people are very knowledgeable about Middle Eastern products and if you don't see something u need they will order it for you."}
{"text":"By far the best shawarma in town, I ordered the sandwich and it was delicious  I highly recommend this place it's good fast and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Very good Middle Eastern food it's very close to home and authentic. I always get the shaworma  plate  yummy."}
{"text":"came in for lunch with my wife and kids, only 3 tables in the whole so called restaurant, a sign on the door that states\" use other door for market\" , I thought was kinda dumb since the market is accessed inside through the 2 table restaurant that is the size of a master bathroom, the register for the market is located in the small restaurant anyway, I ordered a kabob plate and my wife had a shawarma sandwhich,  my kabob plate with tumeric covered rice mixed with \"saffron\" which is a no no, you dont mix saffron with other spices cause saffron is sweet, although the kabob was ok. service was not professional, you would think with only 3 tables in the whole place maybe they would bring the meal to your table, the lady behind the counter was extremely rude, she placed our meals on a tray at the cash register counter saying \"here is yourrrrrr fooood\" as if  we were a burden, we placed a few items inside our cart talking amongst ourselves my wife and I, and the lady was in a hurry to get rid of us rather than help us find the items we were inquiring about, I think she was from southern iraq which indicates why she had a problem with my wife and I speaking arabic in palestinian dialect. we paid for our meals and placed the items from the market that were in our cart back onto the shelves. very rude very unprofessional.  this is not the only mediterranean market in town. wont come back here again.  when signing the credit card transaction, the lady did not say thank you or come back or how was everything nor have a nice day, nothing."}
{"text":"Owner (Nasir) is very rude.  Since he knows that customers are not going anywhere.  Meat is ok but its very expensive just because its halal.  I think he buys the meat from restaurant depot and sells it very expensive.  Even his customer service is very bad."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The lamb kabobs are the best. Great service wonderful people and awesome food. The hummus and garlic dips are great. The food is always fresh and prepared when ordered. Great place for lunch or when needing a healthy snack. One of my regular lunch spots"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, reasonably priced, very casual setting and conveniently attached to the Market. I feasted on the Beef Shawarma Sandwich, the beef was a little dry however, it did not distract from the great flavor.  Yummm."}
{"text":"Add some fries and garlic sauce to the Chicken Shawarma, it tastes amazing.  Very friendly place. It's Halal."}
{"text":"Fabulous fare. Fair prices! Plenty of healthy options. We absolutely love Afandi!  My faves:  Fattoush salad. Grape Leaves. Hummus. Baba. Tabouli. Shish Tawook.  Indepependent, family-owned business with reasonable prices and outstanding service.  My husband also loves the sandwiches and kibbe. Very, very casual (just a couple of tables inside and out designed for a quick bite).  Counter service. Most of the time I do carry out but today we dined inside at a table with a friend. They also have a meat counter and small market with very reasonable prices on quality items.  Great service, too.  I frequently order items (grape leaves are always a hit, as are their salads) from Afandi and bring them when I go to a pot luck event rather than cooking myself! They do catering and their food is always a hit. (I frequently buy meat from their butcher counter as well.)"}
{"text":"I can not explain how much I love this place!  The food is authentic, high quality, and very reasonably priced.  We always get Afandi's when we have a party - we even had them cater our wedding party and everything came out beautifully.  I also make a point to buy my chicken from their butcher counter, as I trust that it is fresh and from a good source (unlike regular grocery stores)."}
{"text":"Good food  Great for general halal meats and cooking ingredients."}
{"text":"The grocery market is very overpriced compared to other stores.they should be more competitive or at least matching other store prices."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I'm from Los Angeles and whenever I come to Vegas to visit my family, I can't leave without eating Afandi. Being a huge fan of Middle Eastern food i'm always exploring different places and hands down this is one of the best places i've ever tried. The garlic spread is delicious and their lamb/chicken kabobs are cooked to perfection. The prices are good and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"Nice food and its halal Best Shawarma!! Same taste of not better like in Saudi Arabia!"}
{"text":"I just got a chicken sandwich it was small but taste good and lamb kebab which was Little  hard to chew they have only four tables and you can hear the people shopping at the market which is right next to it"}
{"text":"Great Service on the Grocery Store.  Fresh Meat.  Clean and Reasonablly priced."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh middle eastern food. Only 3 tables here, so come to get take out or be prepared to eat outside or in your car if you don't want to wait. When we got there today all three tables were empty. The babaganush was fresh and smokey, the hummus was tasty creamy and good. I had a falafel and it was made with care and pickled vegetables in a thin wrap. The falafel balls were tasty and well fried. My husband had a platter of chicken kabob chicken kafta and falafel which came with hummus...all fresh and delish! Highly reccommended for your middle eastern fresh food fix!"}
{"text":"There is a regional variation to how Middle Eastern food is prepared and why it's a little different from a Mediterranean cuisine. I ordered the Kafta Chicken Plate which comes with two ground chicken over yellow basmati rice, Middle Eastern tabbouleh, a pita bread, and a Middle Eastern yogurt. The Kafta Chicken is full of amazing flavor with the addition of many herbs and spices marinated into the meat. However, the yellow basmati rice taste kind of dry. I think it may have sat in the pot too long. Personally, a good basmati rice should always stay fluffy.   Now the Middle Eastern tabbouleh is a mix of parsley, stir fry onion, slice tomatoes, and something that looks like a bright pink pickle. Honestly, I'm not even sure if that is a pickle or a radish. With their version of a tabbouleh, it's as though they prepare it more like a garnish than a salad. The Middle Eastern yogurt has a nice creaminess to it, I can taste a subtle hint of garlic. The yogurt is not overpowering and when you combine it with a piece of Kafta Chicken, it makes the meal delicious.   The great thing about Afandi Restaurant is that after having your meal, you can walk to the next room and do a little grocery shopping at their market. Aside from canned goods and Middle Eastern tasty treats, they do have a small section for fresh produce at the back of their store. So if you're looking to find specific ingredients to make Middle Eastern recipes, this is a good place to go. Pricing is reasonable at the Market, and ordering food at the restaurant is affordable. They do make the food fast, and the people there are very nice. Also this place is as close as you can get to taste the amazing flavor of Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant great flavorful foods  I loved the tabuleh salad and their meats including chicken. Rice was great will def come back."}
{"text":"Came in to grab a late take out lunch- saw the chicken shwarma praised in other reviews and ordered the sandwich. Half of the shop is a grocery and half is a restaurant. After placing my order, I I wandered around the grocery portion while waiting for my order.  Earned an extra star for having my favorite cheese here! It's a sheep milk feta, and it's in the back refrigerator in a square metal can with a pull-tab lid. Brand stars with a V, I never remember what it's called but you'll recognize it or you can ask for it. It's $14 and overpriced (you can find it for $10 in SF) but damn good.  Back to my takeout order. Walked out with my food under five minutes after placing my order, it aws hot and fresh and had just been made.Sandwich was heavy and large, wrapped in several pieces of foil, probably about 9-10\" long.  Got home and devoured it- chicken was hot and fresh but a tad underseasoned, veggies and pita were fresh, but the garlic sauce was a little light for my liking. Per the menu, the garlic sauce is garlic and olive oil which is a little boring. Overall, I found the ingredients to be of good quality but the sandwich seemed to be a bit on the bland side."}
{"text":"While temporarily residing in Vegas, we frequented this Restaurant (Grocery) on several occasions; always eating in.  They really make excellent Kabab -- wraps and plates; and usually had the Dolmas for appetizer.  Fries were an excellent accompaniment.  Also, though not officially sanctioned, we always BYOB when we at here -- just kept it on the 'down low'; and never got hassled."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I'm white and have never been to the Middle East.  I had the best Shawerma of my life 5 years ago at Mediterranean Oasis in Naperville, Il, and ever since then I have been searching for something so good in Las Vegas.  The beef shawerma here was absolutely fantastic. Tons of beef, great tahini, and fresh vegetables all served wrapped up and super hot.  It was under $6 after tax, and right now I never want to live a day in my life without having another one. I concede that I will probably get tired of it eventually, but right now, there is nothing else for me.  The market attached offers other goodies at low prices, and it adds to the ambiance. The place is definitely not a full sit-down restaurant, which is part of the charm. I only interacted with one or two employees, but everyone was kind and welcoming to an obvious outsider.  For me, there was one word to describe it: Wow!"}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST tabouli.  Real Lebanese. So good!  Shawarma chicken and falafel are also very good.  What bothers me is they nickel and dime you.  I called in an order for two sandwiches without pickles, with garlic sauce.  They charged me $1 for putting garlic sauce on the falafel sandwich without mentioning anything to me.  $1 for a small spoonful of garlic sauce?  Annoying, especially since I wanted less toppings than they offer.  I'll go to Khoury's next time I want a sandwich."}
{"text":"My wife and I love the shawarmas. We always get an extra side of garlic. Wow, the garlic is to die for."}
{"text":"So my husband found this amazing mediterranean pomegranate chicken recipe that calls for pomegranate molasses. We went to a couple international stores and couldn't find regular pomegranate molasses. We'd almost given up when I Yelp searched and this place pops up. We were so happy this place had it! They even had 3 different brands to choose from so I'm giving them 5 stars for it! Thank you for that! I still need to try the restaurant side."}
{"text":"I could not resist and went back to this place again.  The food is so good.  I just wish the people were nicer."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for catering. Just check out this whole roast lamb stuffed with rice. Great value, too"}
{"text":"I was recommended here by my husbands auntie that's Iraqi. We decided to bring our mother in law since she's been craving Iraqi food. We ordered chicken Kafta plate, lamb Kafta plate & chicken shawarma sandwich.  My mother in law enjoyed her lamb Kafta, the chicken Kafta was bland it came with this extremely salty cream sauce that they call garlic sauce.  It did not even have a hint of garlic flavor in it at all. This place is a hole in the wall the exterior looks better than the interior. Everyone was very nice so I gave it 3 stars and the food was not horrible it just was NOT good & definitely not worth the drive. Khourys will still be my place of choice to satisfy my middle eastern craving"}
{"text":"The staff at Alfandi's are very pleasant. Their chicken burger was DEE-LI-CIOUS!!!! I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"3.5*.  Solid meal, but nothing super impressive.  The wraps were decent, and the grape leaves were alright.  The food is very inexpensive though, as a coke, an order of like 12 grape leaves, a wrap and some kibbeh was like $14.  The kibbeh was kind of bland.  It was not bad, it just did not blow me away.  Basically everything was decent.  Nothing was bad, nothing was incredible, it was all good enough.  The staff were friendly enough and the prices are great.  I am giving it the round up to 4 because the food was all fine, but the prices were very good."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great little market and fast food restaurant. Love their falafel and fattoush salad. They also sell amazing lamb hot pockets. Love markets like this!"}
{"text":"Hit and miss, sometimes they have everything that I need and other times they have nothing. I've never tried their restaurant or purchase their meat, but when the store is stocked, one will find all of the basic middle eastern staples. The staff is polite and the store is clean."}
{"text":"Good kabOb and lamb i like the lil store with different  oriental products and also meet market also the price affordable!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the food from the restaurant area...DELICIOUS.  Will definitely have to go there again.  Only tried lamb and chicken, along with falafel."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today.   It's a store but they seemed to have more people picking up takeout food than grocery shopping.  Don't expect to dine in.  I think there were a total of 3 tables.  I got takeout.  I had the beef kafta plate.  I prefer lamb but I won't eat it if it's my first time there.  The beef was well seasoned and it was a good size portion.  The flatbread didn't taste like it was from a package.  The rice was well seasoned also."}
{"text":"Food, average; used to be better in the beginning. Customer service, the worst; the cashier, whom seems to be the owner is rude, not a  single thank you, no manners, only to those from his own culture or place, apparently. He should be grateful to us because is us who keep his business going.  Not going back definitely!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite kind of restaurant, a small place that few people know about, dishing out amazing food quick and relatively inexpensive.  Super friendly Iraqi lady working at the counter is gracious pointing out the things they do well.  Best lebanese/middle eastern food I have had in Vegas.  Shawarma and falafel are excellent, great portions.   Might want to order to go, on account of their small dining area.  I love this about Vegas, that there are these little diamonds on the rough you will find if are willing to step out of your comfort zone."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a variation in my diet. A friend suggested this place. It is a Mediterranean store and restaurant. The staff is friendly and helpful with their menu. I really enjoy their kabobs, rice and hummus."}
{"text":"Great food.  Small menu.  Falafels and chicken were on point.  Garlic paste is to die for."}
{"text":"This place had the best grilled lamb kabob I've had in ages! The rice was pretty bland, but I didn't mind with how great the lamb was. It is charred perfectly and very juicy. My boyfriend got a chicken shawarma sandwich, and it was also really great. The market is decent. A lot of sweets from the Middle East are offered inside."}
{"text":"Great grocery store for halal meat and what not. The restaurant is better for take out food as there is very limited room to eat there."}
{"text":"Their little restaurant inside the grocery market makes excellent food. I ordered a sandwich to go, and it was fantastic. Staff are very friendly. Lot of great Middle Eastern goodies. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Kuwait and have searched everywhere for a shawarma that can come close to what I remember eating when I was growing up. The food at this restaurant is amazing and the market sells so many of the things that make me nostalgic for my childhood. I get the beef Shawarma and the chicken kofta sandwiches 4 times a month or so and they are always delicious. The staff at this restaurant / Market are always really very kind and helpful."}
{"text":"Afandi is the place to get kibbe and baba ganoush. The baba is the best in the city, with a mild smokey flavor and just the right amount of Tahini. The kibbe balls are done well with traditional meat and onions on the inside and, again, with the right amount of spice. The regular cucumber, tomato, lettuce salad is an authentic Lebanese salad and tastes almost identical to my grandmother's, with lots of lemon juice, garlic and mint. It still tastes great the next day.  New to me is the Afandi meat, which is like a spicy meatloaf kabob.  Not quite sure what spices are used, but it's delicious, especially when topped with the onions and parsley provided with the order.   I have not been cooking at home lately, but was pleasantly surprised the adjacent Afandi market has a meat counter, where I could presumably request a special grind of meat for dolmas, if I ever make the time to cook those again.   Just a heads up, when ordering take out, it takes a while even if you order in advance and show up 15-20 minutes later. Not sure why."}
{"text":"We order from here quite a few times a month... pretty convenient for picking up pretty good food... we enjoy their schwarma and kafta hallabi... can be a little slow if you are deciding to eat there & not very comfortable surroundings.  All in all, food is good...  your constant companion,  ~deirdra"}
{"text":"I have an Iraqi and an Eritrian friend and co-worker who order from here on almost a daily basis.  The extent of my sampling it limited and I will update when I have tried more things.  the hummus was pretty good..definately had better but the texture and flavor were spot on. The falafel I got the past few times was in a wrap and was actually really good, but it did need to loose alot of the grease that it brought. Shouldn't have have fingers like you have been eating at Popeye's or Harold's chicken when eating falafel  IMO.   I also tried what appeared to be  Loukoumades but I cant be sure. These being fried actually were less greasy than the aforementioned wraps and were very good.  All in all not a bad spot but prob not somewhere I will frequent on my own time."}
{"text":"Ate at the cafe tonight connected to the small market. We purchased halal meat from the butcher counter. We then stepped over to the cafe. Excellent clean meat. I had the spicy chicken kabob and have to say it was VERY good & moist. I also ordered a beef kafta. Very good amount of salt and spices. The beef kabab was so tender. Loved it. Price is right here too! I will be a frequent customer here for sure!"}
{"text":"What do New Yorkers do when in one of the dining capitals of the US? Eat in a bodega, of course.  For under $10, you can eat delicious Middle Eastern quickly. We got the combo platters and each of the meats was terrific. The hummus is also top notch and we got lots of it.  The small restaurant is attached to a store that has all kinds of delicious foods, including some local homemade baklava that we also enjoyed. Definitely worth a stop if you're in town."}
{"text":"This was absolutely one of the best experiences. I was running late to watch today's game RMD Vs LIV, called to order a sandwich and got to talk to Gino (owner and amazing guy), we got to talk about the Champ League Final and told him about my bad luck for not being able to watch it.  He asked me to come over to watch it at Afandi restaurant on his new 65\" TV.  That's what I call going above and beyond, besides the Beef Shawarma Sandwich was mouthwatering!!!  They also have a full house Mediterranean market and meat department which I am sure will meet everybody's needs."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this small, local restaurant. I shop there frequently for groceries and get meat from the deli, which is Halal. The food in the restaurant is splendid. I usually get the lamb or chicken, and have brought many friends here. They recently increased the area for dining, so there are more tables and chairs. It's small, quaint, and lovely. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Small grocery store and dining area.  Both very limited.  I think the place is Iraqi.  The food is good, but not amazing.  Prices seem a bit high.  I like having this place as an option, but it won't be my first pick."}
{"text":"Love the food & the market. Great place to meet up for lunch with friends"}
{"text":"They make delicious fresh tasty food, for very reasonable prices. Chicken skewers are juicy with a light seasoning. Ground beef kabob and beef skewer kabobs are very flavorful and are always cooked just right and can't beat the price."}
{"text":"Grocery store with a small restaurant attached. Owned by a very friendly and hard working guy who employs a small number of friendly people. Very good customer service and they have a full service halal butcher shop, too. Some of the meat is organic, ask the butcher.   As for the restaurant portion, the food is good. I wouldn't say amazing, but very good. Their burger is very tasty though a little heavy on the mayo cabbage sauce. The other wraps and such are an acquired taste. There's a certain flavor that I can't quite figure out that I just don't like in the Falafel, Kabobs and so fourth. Price is very fair for the large portions. They make a good grilled chicken sammy too.   As for the grocery store area, it is okay if you're looking for a few things but they are not a large store by any means. The best thing about Alfandi is the fresh meat selection. Beef, chicken and lamb. The beef is very lean and delicious. As well as all the other meats. A wonderful alternative to shopping at the grocery store for meat. Get it here!"}
{"text":"Who needs a fancy Middle Eastern restaurant when you have this place! The space for dining is as small as it gets, there isn't waitress service, and there are no fancy folded napkins or hookahs, but it is hands down one of the best places I've eaten in Vegas so far for the buck.   The food is fresh, portions are very generous, and just plain delicious! If someone in the group doesn't enjoy foreign foods, they do offer very cheap, American burgers for the boring people hehe ;). Dishes come out rather quickly and they are willing to alter spice levels to your liking. My favorites were the chicken and garlic side dish (forgot the name ?)  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great Arabic food tastes excellent clean place and friendly people , fresh meat and deli the restaurant food clean and one of the best"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the food was delicious.  Friendly staff, clean facility, and the prices are very reasonable.  They have a small dining area that does not have the glamour of larger restaurants, but the food is well worth the visit!  There is a public restroom in the back and surprisingly this is the only establishment I've ever seen that offers a bidet.  Go see it for yourself, as I'm not posting a photo of that.  LOL."}
{"text":"Rotten chestnuts! I paid 7.99 a pound and ALL of them were rotten. What a waste of money specifically after asking the cashier and her confirming they were. Last time I was there I bought tribe and the guy asked if he can cut it up and he did is very small pieces that it was impossible to clean. I am reconsidering ever shopping there again."}
{"text":"If you're questing for falafel, you might as well give Afandi a whirl! This super casual counter-service spot only has a few tables and also features a small Mediterranean market with a butcher, including halal meat. The service wasn't particularly noteworthy. They wouldn't let me sub something for the dolmas on the vegetarian plate, which made me moderately sad. But, I survived.  I ended up ordering falafel, fatoush, hummus and baba ganoush. I wish the order would have come with pita, but it did not.The falafel had a great flavor, but were a bit greasy. They did not travel well, and I suggest taking the time to eat them on the spot if you can and/or getting them in a wrap. The hummus and baba were solid. I was not a big fan of the fatoush as it seemed to be mostly tabbouleh without more substantial pieces of vegetables or lettuces, and there was something missing in the flavor. It simply tasted like tabbouleh. I did not try any meat dishes, but they appear to be a popular choice.  The no substitution policy, fatoush and lack of pita/bread left me a little less than thrilled. However, the falafel is promising and the baba and hummus were fresh and well-executed. Plus, if you actually use your home kitchen, there may be some exciting things in the market for you to cook up!"}
{"text":"Half restaurant / Half grocery store. They have a couple of tables if you want to eat there. Shawarma Sandwiches here are good and the falafel is worth a try. The grocery side is over priced."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch for the first time at Afandi. I've shopped in the market place, but never taken the time to sit down and eat. Food is prepared to order. I had the vegetarian plate and it was great. Every item on was delicious...I could taste all the spices and seasonings. Small/quaint and clean. I'm not foo foo, but I don't usually care for paper plates, however I can appreciate the idea to reduce the chance of spreading germs or utensils not always coming out of the dishwasher clean. It took a little maneuvering on my part with the plastic utensils, but I managed. Mainly because everything tasted so good. So, my thought was do what you need to do to consume your meal. It was a little too much for me to finish in one sitting, so I asked for to-go container and finished the rest today for lunch. I wanted to post a picture, but unable to figure that part out. I don't see any options on my page.  Oh, I found really really fresh pita bread. It's still not from Michigan, but it was a pleasure to feel fresh bread.  Yes, I will be back. I also love the idea that they have Halal meat."}
{"text":"Man I just love the chicken shawarma sandwich. I call ahead and then pick it up. Great combo of coriander spice, sauce and pickle with parsley. Every single person to whom i have introduced this sandwich has become a diehard fan. Try it, you will thank me!"}
{"text":"Best shish Tawook ever. It's a tasty wrap with chiken and vegetables  Was going to take a picture but I ended up eating it and then I remembered to take a picture and it was too late. Ha ha ha"}
{"text":"Fabulous food & ambiance! I recommend this to all my friends! Mediterranean food, authentic and delicious"}
{"text":"Today we needed a last minute lunch for some guest.  Afandi knocked it out of the park for us, the food was incredibly good and at a great price.  We will being using these folks again.  Highly recommend the food and their hospitality is outstanding as well."}
