{"text":"Staff is friendly. My latte was really good and my breakfast sandwich was hot and great tasting. I only wish they did not use  styrofoam cups and used a recyclable material. Otherwise a great option!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and the service was very friendly, but I really wasn't impressed with the food. My son got a pancake that was very good; sweet and fluffy. But the omelette I ordered was scorched and the hash browns were very greasy and left a puddle of grease on the plate."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast twice and have not been disappointed.  Food is delicious and reasonable priced. Service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Kind of a strange set up but he food is great. I go for breakfast often and it is very reasonably priced- especially bagel sandwiches and they're so good!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on Saturday and ordered 2 eggs over medium with fruit.  Eggs come out one is perfect other is a broken yolk that has been cooked.  That is not over meduim.  That should never have come out of the kitchen.  Also pineapple very dry and tasteless. Very disappointed.  Have some pride in what you serve."}
{"text":"The food is good but the past few times I went, the service was poor. Even when it isn't busy, you basically get ignored. First, when I walked in along with another group of people, we all stood there for a few minutes before a waitress yelled over the basically empty room that we could just sit anywhere. Second, after the waitress brought my food, she went to another table and stayed there the rest of the time talking to them! I waited almost 15 minutes after I clearly had pushed my plate away so she would come over and give me the check but that never happened. I ended up having to ask another waitress there if I could have my check just so I could leave. This isn't the first time I've waited for too long in this restaurant. Management needs to teach their staff to pay attention to the customers."}
{"text":"We have been patrons of Sweet Spot since the day the opened.  We have always had great food and great service from each of our servers.  Nice little spot for a weekend breakfast."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service is terrible - there was only one other group in the restaurant and our food sat by the kitchen for a good 5 minutes. Servers walked by it the entire time. On top of that, my order was incorrect! Sadly the correct sandwich came out twice as fast as my original order. In return, a sad apology for a lack of paying attention. That will reflect in your tip, ma'am.

If you don't have anywhere to be, and enjoy your servers taking their sweet time providing mediocre service, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Delicious home cooked breakfast! They have smoothies and ice cream too. Cute home town place."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in town. Great potions, good prices, and excellent service. The home fries are some of the best I've ever had. Everyone there is always very friendly and offer to go drinks when you leave. I haven't gotten to go for lunch or dinner yet but would expect it to be excellent as well."}
{"text":"Sweet charming little breakfast spot in an up and coming city. The service was quick, friendly and reliable. The food was just average. I ordered the standard breakfast plate. (I'm not sure if that's what it's really called). It was super cheap and included eggs, hash browns and a meat of your choice.

The food was average, and nothing to brag about. I was impressed with the mimosas! They were delicious! 

I don't recommend big groups, this place is really small! You get a bang for buck and I appreciate that! I think my entire bill was about $12!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, fluffiest egg white omelette ever and really good breakfast sausage. We also go for the frozen yogurt, my son loves the green apple flavor and the tons of toppings they offer. Service is always great. We'll go back again and again"}
{"text":"Super homey diner feeling with a great breakfast menu. Good prices and portion sizes. Everything that we saw on plates looked really good. The stuffed french toast and the big breakfast plate were both awesome!"}
{"text":"If all you need is a basic bacon and eggs breakfast, this place will do. It's not fancy, but well kept and clean. The menu is pretty good and covers about all breakfast tastes.

There was really nothing that stood out to talk about that arrived on the plate, but I will say our waitress was fantastic."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service. Good menu selection. Food is bland. Waffle wasn't hot, although it came quickly; bacon was good flavor, but limp; hash browns were a bit dry; eggs over easy were perfectly cooked; gravy for biscuit was quite thick; sausage links appeared to be turkey sausage, though that's not what was ordered; decent coffee."}
{"text":"This an excellent, affordable, low key restaurant! I have gone here for breakfast several times and the service and food are great. The staff is friendly and quick, and the food is fresh and well cooked. It's definitely a spot to check out if you live in the area!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  Fresh food,  great service, reasonably priced.  Running early morning errands and decided to stop in for a quick breakfast. Poached eggs - cooked perfectly with tasty turkey sausage.  Great cup of coffee that was never empty."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is great for a busy breakfast place which this area was in great need of. I'm a frequent customer and suggest it to everyone!"}
{"text":"We really liked this place. It wasn't just because there's a Ms. PacMan video game sitting there as you walk in the door. I wished I had a pocket full of quarters...it took me back to my childhood when you could go to the corner store and play video games.

Anyway, the food and service were equally as amazing. Our waiter, the only male server in the place, we so nice and funny. He was very personable, which I love in people when I go out to eat. We had a carb-free breakfast the day we visited. We both had omelettes without the bread, and a side of fresh fruit. (That day they had only watermelon. I am NOT a fan of watermelon, at all.) I also like that they had flavored coffee and lattes and various other drink options. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"A decent breakfast place if you're in the neighborhood. They're very friendly and attentive. The food is mediocre compared to other breakfast places in Charlotte, but since its across the street from my house, I give it 4 star for the convenience and friendly service."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast when you don't feel like cooking it yourself, but still want a home cooked taste! The staff was friendly and accommodating, the prices are great especially for the portion sizes that you get! Pancakes are huge!!! 1 person cannot eat more than 2! I will definitely be coming back especially since it is just around the corner from home!"}
{"text":"Edison Square is on the rise and tons of new businesses have been moving in over the past few months. I didn't come in with huge expectations, just simply wanted breakfast foods. 

When we were first walked in, we were told to sit anywhere we want as it was not busy at all. The menu consisted of general breakfast items like waffles, pancakes, eggs, bacon, etc... I personally think it was kind of expensive ranging from $9-12 for a plate. I got toast, and the toast is UNUSUALLY SMALL!!! I am still wondering where one can get toast that small! Instead of putting the butter on the toast, I would prefer for them to not because since the surface area of the toast was so small, it soaked up the butter and easily burned in the toaster. 

I'm interested to taste what they have for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Sunday afternoon and we were happy about our decision.  There was no wait for a table for three and we did not have to wait long for our order to be taken.  

The food was so good (or we were so hungry) that I didn't get to take pictures.  My omelet and home fries were fresh, hot and tasty - and so was my guys French toast.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is I went without a coffee refill for most of my meal.  Not the worst, I will be back."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot, the service was awesome and the food was delicious. I had the steak and eggs my wife had the breakfast special. I'm definitely going back, even become a regular."}
{"text":"I always try and support small business and finding a non chain breakfast is somewhat difficult in the Concord Mills area.  We gave the Sweet Spot a shot after recommendations from friends and was pleasantly surprised.  A former yogurt store the Sweet Spot (Edison Cafe, or whatever the name is) was a bit crowded Sunday morning but service was prompt and food arrived moments after ordering. 

I had the Country breakfast which is served with 2 eggs, meat of choice, Biscuit, and gravy.  For 6.99 I would have hoped for at least 2 sausage patties but only 1 was included, it was OK. The Biscuit was very good though and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  My son had Biscuits and Gravy with a side of hasbrowns, these scattered hasbrowns had on off flavor which is my reason for 3 stars, not very good at all but the rest of our meal was good.

Food: 3.5 Sporks
Service: 4 Sporks
Atmosphere: 3.5 Sporks
Value: 4 Sporks"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast spot.  We love the bagel sandwiches and you can add any omelet ingredient to the sandwich.  The grits are soooo good. I've heard the biscuits are good but haven't had one yet.  Also the prices are dirt cheap."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe/restaurant. Our waitress New we were in a hurry and worked really hard to get us our food as quickly as possible. The food was delicious!"}
{"text":"This was my third or fourth time coming here for breakfast; I doubt I'll be back!

This restaurant has gone downhill significantly since my first visit roughly two years ago. Cleanliness has become a big issue (sticky menu, dirty booth seat). Wait staff makes you feel like they're doing you a favor by doing their job.

They had a hostess when I arrived, but she wasn't there when I went up to pay my bill. A waitress rolling silverware at the counter across the room yelled \"what do you need honey\"...ummm...to pay my bill with the cash I have in my hand while standing at a register?

She came over, stared at the bill and my cash as though she had never seen anything like it before, and said she'd take it to my waitress. Apparently my waitress is the only one who can take my payment?

This place is in a great location, and has great potential, but it definitely needs revamping from the top down."}
{"text":"Their breakfast is pretty good.  The biscuits seem to be homemade and they are pretty big.  They serve livermush which is a plus in my book.  The coffee is only so-so."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot - especially for weekend brunch! They stop serving breakfast at 1pm on weekends though so get there early! Highly recommend the Country Fried Steak with home fries. Their gravy is delicious! We also tried their French toast which I would give a 3/10. The syrup isn't good which made the French toast fall flat. But the gravy makes up for it."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality. The wait staff are great. The food, not so much. You must ask for real eggs. I would have thought that would be a given."}
{"text":"Thanks to the friendly staff at the Sweet Spot for helping support the Edison Square 5k to Stamp Out Cystic Fibrosis.  Our runners enjoyed the hearty breakfasts after the event!"}
{"text":"Lived in Concord for 4 years and never knew about this part of town. Service was good and staff was very welcoming. Food was delicious, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I like!!! Great breakfast spot!

Keep in my though, full breakfast menu only available on Sundays. The great thing about their breakfast menu is that although it seems basic, most items are customizable. So instead of a ton of fancy-named hit/miss dishes, they list the basics and you tailor. For example, with my omelet I was able to pick exactly what I wanted in it and there was a large variety of sides select from. 

No issues with service. The food was served in a reasonable time considering how busy the place was. Server was polite and efficient. Also everything was delicious. 

They also have self-serve fro-yo, Yay!!!"}
{"text":"I got Nutella and strawberry crepes and they were good but WAY too much nutella and I have a major sweet tooth. Ask for 1/2 nutella and you will enjoy it much more. Boyfriend got chocolate chip pancakes (4 count) WAY TOO MANY. Only get the 2 count. They're huge and he only ate one!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast here is always a 5/5. The service is always great and the food is great! 
The frozen yogurt here is just ok and it's really really overpriced."}
{"text":"I'm always searching for the mom & pop restaurants. This place was a nice little breakfast spot. Probably my only complaint was the slow service, but they were pretty busy. Before leaving make sure to grab you a cup of coffee, especially if you like mocha frappes!!!"}
{"text":"I live in highland creek and have been curious to come into the sweet spot for breakfast so my dad and I went this morning. Really really good breakfast sandwiches and home fries. They make the buscuits from scratch and you can tell! I also loved that I could order a coffee made with almond milk. Can't find that at too many breakfast places and it was delicious. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Nice cozy spot for good ol plain food! Not fancy or pretentious but tasty  and good portions!

We both ordered the 3 egg omelettes. Mine was cheese, red peppers, mushrooms, onions n avocado - note  to self ask for avocado  on the side as it's mushy n not as tasty cooked inside the omelette!  I also had hash browns cooked just the right crispy I prefer and 2 sad  lil pieces of wheat  toast lol 

The hubs has same omelette minus the avocado  he was smart on that and fried potatoes decent taste but not life changing with even sadder looking white toast lol 

No wait for noon on a Saturday and very fast service!  Prices are excellent for the portions served.  

Definitely has a diner vibe - average food but tasty n plentiful for a quick bite.  

Staff was friendly and the place was clean !!!!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for the first time. Positive: waitress was very friendly. Negative: it took an unusually long time for our food to come out and it was only 2 of us. When we were seated there was a table of 6 people seated already and they got their food way after us. They weren't that busy in my opinion. The food was average. I ordered hash browns - crispy and browned. They were beige and soft. The omelet was just ok, the biscuits were not flavorful - definitely not buttermilk. My husband ordered the steak and eggs and said it was good. I'll give this place another try but if it's the same slow service and lackluster food - I'm done."}
{"text":"Name is changing to Edison Eatery apparently... but same owners. It's a cute little spot. Great pork roll, although the egg was a bit well done... chatty waiter kept telling us his life story, but otherwise very nice. Good food, good coffee."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place accidentally.  I was pleasantly pleased.  I will go back even though its out of my way.  They have plenty of options on the menu and posted on the board.  The staff is very friendly.  Our food was very good. I was really impressed."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service is not good. We waited over an hour for two very simple breakfast orders."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite while waiting on an appointment in the area, and service was definitely speedy. Interesting little spot - very friendly staff, which was nice considering they were completely empty (hate it when the place is empty but they cannot seem to figure out customer service or be able to serve anything).

When it comes to the food, it's a perfectly reasonable stop, one thing that stood out is a Taylor Ham roll. Not amazing, but if you're seeking one, this is a place you can find one. Other than that, standard breakfast fare, and definitely worthwhile for a friendly face."}
{"text":"As the other reviewers have said, this is a convenient spot for the locals to have breakfast. But don't forget they have a nice selection of frozen yogurt and 30 toppings
You pick a cup, help yourself to selections of yogurt or ice cream . Then you go to the buffet table to add as many toppings as you like. They have 30 choices like gummy bears, chocolate chips, cherries, candy bars and more. 
After that you get it weighed and pay. Clean friendly place. Plenty of tables to sit
Watch sports on the tv or cartoons on the big screen
The bagels, muffins, and coffee look good too
A grandkid favorite"}
{"text":"Wanted a quick and amazing breakfast while we were visiting Great Wolf Lodge. This place fit the bill. The price was reasonable for the quality and amount of food we got."}
{"text":"We discovered the restaurant recently and thought we would try their dinner. 

The restaurant was empty even though surrounding restaurants had waits of 30 min or more but we wanted to try a new place. 

The staff seemed rather disengaged, but friendly.  I asked our server for suggestions and she said she hadn't tried the food and didn't know what to recommend. 

We placed our order and the food came out wrong even though we were the only patrons. We didn't want to complain as we had a wait on the food, which was longer than expected being the only people ordering food. 

The food was only warm, so even more disappointing.

While eating the staff were playing with the light dimmers and the lighting was going up and down....not a good experience while eating. 

We like to try new places but unfortunately this experience caused us to not be able to recommend or have any desire to visit again. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"We ventured over to The Sweet Spot one morning for breakfast, having a craving for both good coffee and hash browns.  They are a bit of a hike for us, but the trip was well worth it.

I had the Perfect Breakfast, with scrambled eggs (adding cheddar), hash browns, and a biscuit.  My husband had an omelet with home fries and a biscuit.  Both of our breakfasts were yummy.  The biscuits were soft and fluffy, the hash browns were both soft and crispy (and no extra seasoning needed!), and the potatoes were nicely flavored with peppers.  

Their lattes were similarly good.  We ordered two regulars with an extra shot (three shots all told), and no syrup.  They were piping hot, strong, and delicious.  

Service was fast and friendly.  We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to hear about the bad experience others have had here. We loved it! Delicious breakfast. Good prices. Friendly staff. Nice atmosphere. This was our first time coming here and we will definitely be back to try lunch and ice cream too!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never seen this place or have heard anyone talking about it around town!  We decided to do Easter breakfast here.  They were busy when we first arrived but worth the wait.  I ordered the big eaters breakfast.  Everything was good other than the meat.  The bacon could have been cooked longer and the sausage was weird. Everything was really good though!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to take a picture of my food! I usually take one but it didn't last long on my plate. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with hash browns. Both were amazing. My husband ordered an omelette with home fries. Everything came to us quickly and neatly. Our coffee was also refilled before it had a chance to get cold. We stopped here on a whim instead of going to Cracker Barrel and we are so glad we did. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, they serve breakfast all day and is cooked to order and tastes super fresh and full of spices. Plus the coffee is awesome!"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced. We went on s Sunday morning and, much to my 20 month old's delight, they had Dora playing on a big screen!
I will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful local breakfast spot. Food selection is customizable and delicious. Service is pretty spot on for how busy they get and the servers are friendly. We are regulars and they usually already know what we are getting, which is nice (gives it that small hometown feel)."}
{"text":"What a great find off the beaten path away from the chain restaurants and tourist attractions around Concord. 

We met family here for brunch since it was half way between us (they live in Georgia and were at Great Wolf Lodge for the long weekend) the staff was incredibly accommodating to a family of 4 adults and 4 kids, having no problem getting our table ready even when our whole party hadn't arrived yet.  

I got the Cobb salad that was chock full of all sorts of good stuff.  My son got a blueberry pancake and my husband had his own omelet that he's still talking about.  

The staff was very attentive with checking-in, and didn't rush us at all, even after we were done eating.  

Their kid menu is on the smaller side, but I feel like it's really just there as a suggestion since they're able to essentially put together whatever you'd like, even on a smaller scale.  

One of our omelets did come out with some wrong ingredients but they were quick to fix it, and we all left really happy. Definitely be sure to take a chance on The Sweet Spot if you find yourself in the area!"}
