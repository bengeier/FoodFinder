{"text":"The food is great and the spicy shrimp taste good,but the service is terrible! I've never seen such a waitress in my life!"}
{"text":"Came here almost everyday cause it's close to my place and it's near metro station. In addition, their food is great! I love eating spicy food, which is why I always order their spicy crawfish and spicy fried chicken. I do not like eating vegetables but there is one vegetarian food in Sorgho Rouge that I really like- spicy napa with bean noodles! It's not very spicy but I like the flavour. However, if you don't like salty food, this one could be too salty for you. Oh, I forgot to mention their BBQ! It's so Chinese, they cooked it with charcoal fire, when it came to the table, I can almost smell the fire! LOL! Really love the BBQ Chicken leg. It's bit sweet, salty but it tastes best if you ask them to make it spicy! LOL, it seems that I mentioned so many times of \"spicy\". They also have so non-spicy food, but I would recommend you to try their spicy ones."}
{"text":"I must say I am very disappointed to learn that Sorgho Rouge has sold their restaurant. I absolutely adored their spicy fish filet. It was nothing like I have every tasted: light, tender, full of flavour, spice at the right level, mixed with cool vegetables. I would LOVE to know where they went???"}
{"text":"We ended up here by chance because the place we were supposed to go was under maintenance. I've passed here so many times and was never really drawn in due to it being on the second floor, so you can't see inside and you don't get the wafts of delicious food when you walk by. 

But as soon as we walked in, we were overwhelmed with this delicious spicy sichuan smell, my tummy started growling. The plates were massive and all looked and smelled great. My only complaint was \"there's too much choice! I want everything!\"

 I finally settled on #20. The szechuanese fish with red chili. I rarely ever order fish at restaurants because its usually way overcooked, freezer burnt and dry. But considering this was swimming in a spicy broth, I was drawn to it. 
My boyfriend ordered the #25 beef stewed with szechuan spicy sauce. His was a bold roasted flavor. He enjoyed it thoroughly but I wasn't impressed by it. When my dish came to the table, I was overjoyed. It smelled fantastic and tasted even better. Perfectly málà (numbing and spicy) with a hint of sweetness. The fish was so delicate and moist, it was falling apart between my chopsticks. The broth was so good, I even took it home to poach some other seafood in it.

I can't wait to try more of the dishes here, we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Saw the \"Wednesday Specials\" sign outside, \"reduced price but not portion\" they said.

Went inside to order 2 special dishes. The waitress with a crappy attitude said \"I don't recommend you ordering more than 1 special dish because the specials are all fried.\"

\"But I don't care about it being fried.\"

\"Yeah but we don't recommend you doing so.\"

\"Are we not aloud to order more than one special or you don't recommend?\"

\"You are not aloud.\"

Ordered 1 special dish with a noodle dish, the dishes were crappier than the service. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"The place reopened last summer about two minutes away from its old location. The first floor is for the stir-fry and they now offer all-you-can-eat hot pots on the second floor. My review will be solely on the hot pot as I have yet to try their stir-fry dishes.

The place is much smaller than the Little Sheep located in downtown and Brossard, and they offer fewer varieties for vegetable, tofu, and other stuffs for hot pots. They do not have a soda fountain, and they provide 2L soda bottles instead (free of charge). It is much smaller in scale comparing to Little Sheep, and thus less choices and slightly poorer dining experience.

The service was quite nice, I've heard friends complaining about it but I really liked it during my last visit. One of the waitress was very outgoing, chatty, and very enthusiastic.

The lamb slices were very mediocre, they broke into little pieces when put into the hot pot. The beef slices were, however, fantastic. They were beautifully marbled with fat, and had a wonderful taste with a tender texture.

The hot pot bases were actually dishes, there were several to choose from: spicy shrimp, duck heads, vegetarian, or pork bone soup. When the dishes are finished, stock is added to the spices that were left from the dishes and brought to a boil. I liked the idea, and the duck heads tasted wonderfully cooked.

The place is significantly more pricier than any other hot pot restaurants I have been to, about 35$ per person with tips and taxes included. I did not like how the cashier nonchalantly punched in the 15% \"service charge\" without asking me first, the amount of tips is a personal preference according to the service and should never be an obligation."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant more than 5 times, and have never been disappointed. Been to both the downstairs Sichuan restaurant and the upstairs hotpot and loved both. 

The downstairs dishes had a strong taste (except the Yuxiang eggplants which was pretty bland to my surprise) which fits my likings. I especially like the big plate chicken, the pork intestines, and the braised pork+potatoes+quail eggs combo, very flavourful. The spiciness is just right, not as spicy as most Sichuan dishes elsewhere.

The upstairs hotpot is like no hotpot I've had before. First, you have to choose your base between more than 6 choices including duck heads, shrimps and chips, frog legs, pork bone, rice, etc. Then, they serve you the base and instructs you to eat the content (ie the duck heads, shrimps, etc) before putting more water and starting the actual hotpot. All the bases ingredients were super tasty. My favorites are the duck heads and the shrimps & chips. 

The aspect that I love the most about this place though is its service. All the servers that I have encountered are super nice and chill, made me feel at home. The only reason why I would give it more of a 4.7 is the prices. The hotpot price includes a basic price and 4$ for the base soup, which can add up at dinner time. The downstairs restaurant can be expensive for two people, but very affordable if a lot of people share. They have a big table which accommodates 8-10 people, so its good for big groups. Overall very underrated and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"A relaxing place to spend time with friends or family. These fondue places are great in that you can slow down and spend time conversing and really enjoy a meal. Its also bring your own wine or beer."}
{"text":"Not bad food, i went upstairs for the hot pot and the new waiter is so nice and cute but a little clumsy hihi :3"}
{"text":"Best lamb skewers in town. We also tried the chicken skewers in the same seasoning the crispy chicken skin with the meat was so crunchy and juicy. The vegetable soup was also pretty good. The eggplant dish which i order in every chinese restaurant here wasn't the best, was too sweet. I loved the spicy beans, refried pork(hui guo ro) and the yu xiang ro si pork. Will definetely bring my parents here for the authenticity of the chinese food."}
