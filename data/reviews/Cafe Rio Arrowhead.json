{"text":"I just wanted to try it out....i ordered the 2 grilled chicken enchiladas with cheese..the order was cold. Tortillas were thick and broken. Cheese was miniscule...chicken was very dryyyyy and unflavored. it was nothing like the photo at alllll.  A child could have done a better job.....veryyyy dissapointed.....drinks were not tasting proper either..  i dont know if i would go again......probably not"}
{"text":"The staff was pleasant and very helpful. The is food fresh as evident by the girl cooking the fresh tortillas on the grill.  The  place was clean but there is limited seating inside for large groups of more than 5 or more. I had the cheese enchiladas with the mild sauce, rice and pinto beans. The enchiladas were good along with the pinto beans but the rice was undercooked and way too firm."}
{"text":"First of all, the food here is amazing. I usually get a salad with the classic sweet pork. The sweet pork is to die for, it's always delicious. They put a tortilla on the bottom of your salad and the tortillas (which are being made fresh in front of you) are absolutely delicious. I crave this salad nonstop and have been going to Cafe Rio about twice a week for the last month or so. 

This place gets three stars because of the inconsistent service. This is a new location and it's obvious they are still working out the kinks to get things going smoothly. My biggest complaint is that most of the time, getting down the line is very slow. People starting their orders often don't know what they want or are asking a lot of questions to the ONE person getting their food going. I've been 2-3 back in the line and waited there over 20 minutes just to get a to go order. This would be unheard of for most fast food places and comparable places like Chipotle, who have figured out how to get people in and out in minutes. 

Then, once you've made it through the slow moving line to order, there is usually only one cashier and there is another line a few people deep to wait in. I often wonder why they don't have two registers going to move people faster. At this location, I've seen people in line say something to the manager, who will open the other register but I just don't think customers should be requesting this. Often, their cashiers seem unsure of the flow and things get mixed up at the end of the food line as well. 

Overall, I will continue to keep coming here because the food is so delicious but I will admit to dreading the inevitable wait I will have to endure to get it."}
{"text":"First time at this location... after 15 minutes of waiting in a line that hadn't moved I walked out.  Employees seemed to be trying but several were standing around laughing.  Disappointing and frustrating to waste so much time on an operation that doesn't know how to handle volume.  Too many options that appreciate their customer's time to come back here again."}
{"text":"This location is very inconsistent. I order enchiladas every time I'm here and it seems that everyone makes them a bit differently- some soak the enchiladas with salsa, while others leave them dry. Some default to a certain cheese while others ask what kind I want. Once I came in and they handed me a drink saying it came with the order and then other times that didn't happen. I feel that a restaurant should always be consistent. Also, twice I ordered enchiladas and they started making quesadillas. They always apologize after and remake what I asked for but the workers seem to be having so much fun and the vibe is so chill behind the counter that mistakes are made. The food is incredible and the staff very nice but the low stars is due to inconsistencies and a lackadaisical attitude that leads to mistakes."}
{"text":"They should've used a bigger location. The seating is horrible because they're always busy people are standing right up against you when you're trying to sit down at a table to eat.  The seating area is too small and frankly if there's just not enough seats.  The food here is still as good as the other locations but I would avoid this place if you want to sit down and eat and not have people staring in your face when you're trying to enjoy a meal with your family."}
{"text":"We stopped over yesterday for tacos, the tacos were excellent! Yes it is busy. Grand opening of course. The staff was pleasant and very good about answering questions. We had a buy one get one coupon so we had the salads today! The salad was delicious! I did like the tomatillo ranch sauce & they cook all the tortillas fresh in house! I would recommend getting the app to save a few bucks! Overall we enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Cafe Rio since they opened in north Phoenix. I am sad to say that I will no longer be a patron at this establishment. How my questions regarding gluten free options and having to be gluten free due to a recent diagnosis of Celiacs for my 8 year old daughter were announced to the entire restaurant at the Bell and 75th Ave location was not what I have come to expect of Cafe Rio. She was almost in tears. What makes it even worse was that this was the first time we had attempted to take her out to a restaurant. We did the research prior to going to this restaurant and we thought we had it down. The rude announcement made it clear that not only did we not have it down, but that the whole restaurant needed to know that information. If you have food allergies please be forewarned that they will be announced to the entire restaurant. They are not an allergy friendly restaurant. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Food here is fine but the service is terrible, slow and they just don't listen. I love Cafe Rio but this location is really bad , both food wise and service wise ."}
{"text":"Meh... tasted like cafeteria Mexican food. We had the enchiladas and quesadilla. The staff were friendly and it was busy but overall we thought it was bland and just ok. I think there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"We love this place! It blows chipotle out of the water. They are always super friendly and fast with service. They also notice the regulars which shows a lot especially for such a new place! We go weekly!"}
{"text":"Very disorganized. Food was okay but overpriced. I got a vegetarian burrito and it was the same price as the burrito that included meat. I did get the smallest scoop of guacamole possible. I doubt I got double beans and rice like the sign said was included with the vegetarian burrito. 

Seating area is very small.  Will not go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Love the food.  Their salads and nachos are good.  I am only giving this location a two start because of how poorly it is run.

I have been to this location 4 times and called in an order to go and the issue that stands out the most is the service.  They do not have any organization- it seems like they don'y have a manager or someone who can train. 

I want to talk about the To Go orders first.  If you order to go, expect basically the delivery time of a pizza.  I got to Cafe Rio ten minutes before they told me to.  I could see the bag of food that was my order all packaged up.  And the manager said \"ten more minutes\".  In my head I am like- why didn't he check if it was done early? I don't want to wait and have the food start cooling down when I can just pay and go home to eat. So we let one of the workers know that that was our order.  They only have one register, so expect to wait until the dine-in person gets done- which also takes forever. We eventually paid and walked out.  Got home and the nachos only have cheese on them. 

We go back to the location and told them the items that show on the receipt are not on the nachos.  All the manager did was apologize and go put the toppings in a container.  I am not sure if he knows how nachos work, but they don't taste as good when the cheese has been sitting for a while now (think about it sitting there, driving 10 minutes home, ten minutes back..).  So I asked if they could make us new nachos- but we still had to put toppings on ourselves for whatever reason.  That took a while as well.  

In that same visit coming back for the second time, a worker who helped us the first time did not recognize us- which, I would not expect her to.  But the manager expected her to and lectured her in front of the public about it.  We were at a table and I could hear him.  I just thought that was so unprofessional.  Any good manager would have pulled the employee aside if they had some feedback for them without embarrassing them. 

When you go to the store and order your food- it also takes forever.  The employees almost don't know what they are doing.  There was a long line and two employees looked like they were just standing in the back. The lines are so slow.  It is not like chipotle, mad greens, subway, etc where you can just get through the line.  I will say though- it is faster to go to the restaurant and wait in the line than order it for pick up. There was a lady who ordered to go, it still wasn't ready and so she got in line and had her food sooner.  

I know it is a new store so I have some understanding- I would just have hoped it would have gotten a little better each time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! I love their rewards program too. Their sweet pork burrito with hot sauce is delicious and the shredded chicken burrito with habanero sauce is a close second. Every burrito comes with a salad and pico de Gallo."}
{"text":"Nothing too special. A tad greasy and messy. Decent prices for a Mexican chain.Overall...just average. A much better and healthier option for the same price would be Rubios or Chipotle."}
{"text":"tasty food  , west side needs many more g;ood restaurants. with better management this could be a 5 star  star.  management clean up the floor and empty the trash."}
{"text":"I was behind a very angry customer today who made it awkward for everyone. Apparently it's not appropriate for the manage to guide his employees to run a perfectly smooth ship. I come three times a week I've seen them at their best and worst and their team work has always been impeccable !!!! Leadership is key!!!! Don't let pushy customers pressure you into changing your methods that have proven to work over and over again !!!!  This place seriously puts the customer and quality over all else !!!  I went in tonight for my typical chicken salad with the always so juicy meat and no griddle of fat ever !!  And they were out of the white crumbly cheese I like. Instead of just telling me like any other faster fresh food place would that they were out. They said. 
\"Hang one one second I'll go make some fresh for you from the block of cheese in the back ! \" 
Like ........ serious service people ! If you haven't tried this place then you should because everything about them is good !!!!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time, great and fast service, food was so good, has a lot of flavor and portions are more than enough!!! Free kids quesadilla is definitely a huge plus for me since I have 2 little ones."}
{"text":"This place has the arguably the best authentic, mexican fast food around. Tortillas are fresh and hand made,  and their burritos enchilada style are the amazing."}
{"text":"Terrible Mexican food and very long wait times. Ive been to a few cafe Rios and this one is probably the worst. I dont care for generic Mexican food in general but at least be quick and painless about it. 

There is nothing quick or painless about this place. Took about 30 minutes because they ran out of chicken mid rush. Employees were scrambling to the back to chop more up like some damn fire drill. 

Will not be back."}
{"text":"This is my first ever Yelp review and I made my account solely to post about my disappointing experiences. My boyfriend and I went here a week or so ago, and two bites into his food, he got a large chunk of gristle in his burrito and couldn't even continue eating it. My salad was, ehhh, okay so I ate the rest of it. He swore to never go back. I thought I'd give it another try tonight and now I'm hopping on board with him, I too, won't ever go back. When I arrived at 8 PM there were five people in front of me and another 3-4 in the process of going through the food assembly line. It took 17 minutes for me to even reach the counter to begin ordering my food. 25 minutes from the time I arrived to the time I walked out the door (I took my food to go) is how long it took. That was the first hiccup in my personal Rio experience. I then got home, and as I'm eating my food, pick up what I thought was a piece of dark meat, in my chicken breast. I was wrong-- it was a sharp bone. Not to mention... the \"shredded\" chicken was hardly shredded, I had to pull apart most of the huge chunks of meat myself. Won't EVER go here again... Get it together, Rio-- so much potential!"}
{"text":"Disgusting! Everything has Cilantro! I hate Cilantro - it tastes like soap. At the beginning of the line I asked for a taco salad - and told them not to put anything on it with Cilantro. Everything had Cilantro down to only one choice of dressing - even the chopped tomatoes had Cilantro. Very \"one note\" flavor. The textures of the food is that of a pre-cooked food line. The only reason I have it one star is I had to.  I would not recommend this place. 
Seating is also very limited inside. Plenty of room on the patio - it's only 112* in the shade today!"}
{"text":"The food I got was ok, but the staff wasn't very helpful and things got chaotic trying to order for the family.  I was informed when I asked for the hot sauce that one I wanted was only for burritos and sadly I had ordered a tostada so no hot sauce for me, which is why they only get 2 stars, I tend to judge Mexican places partially on their hot sauces and since I couldn't try the ones I wanted I will probably never come back.  Also almost any variation costs extra."}
{"text":"This location needs to be renamed 'cafe rio to go' since there are 4 tables and bar stools. Where do people eat? Outside in 115 degrees facing west? In a hot car? So much for 'going out for lunch or dinner'. Not here, just to go :-("}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, large portions and a feast for the eyes, but slightly on the sweet side. 

Thanks to a gift from a friend, my family and I tried Cafe Rio off Bell Road today. We were surprised by the large portions. We ordered a nachos, enchiladas. a salad and a quesadilla.

They offer a number of meats. Daughter Number 1 chose a salad with shredded chicken. Daughter Number 2 ordered a pork barbacoa quesadilla. Hubby had the grilled steak nachos. I chose the green chile pork enchilada with green chile sauce. I also had the grilled steak enchilada with a tomatillo sauce. 

The flour tortillas are handmade and amazing. They are super large and are served up with most meals.

We all agreed that the grilled steak was pretty good. The shredded chicken was okay. The pork barbacoa was on the sweet side and so was the green chile pork.

We liked the bright and fiery fresh salsa. We thought the guacamole was good. The pico de gallo was fresh and pretty. The black beans was a nice option to pinto beans, but a little too much on the liquid side that made the tortilla mushy. We loved the tangy cilantro rice.

The servers were had were a little on the impatient side and were not particularly warm and friendly. However, it was during a very busy part of the day. We had to pack leftovers because the portions were huge."}
{"text":"First thought, very much like chipotle just with night end meats, flavors and super fresh vegetables. 

Fire grilled chicken salad with the habanero salsa topped with guac, sour cream and house dressing! Delicious and fresh! Did I say it tastes fresh? It really did.

Glad I finally checked out this place out!"}
{"text":"I go to cafe rio a lot, so I was excited to have one open up by me. But, this one needs to learn from the one on 950 E. bell rd. That location does not mess up on orders and does not shy away from using chicken that you pay extra for. Food is good, but service needs to be better."}
{"text":"Always great food. Today my boyfriend order my salad and it came out looking nothing like normal. I hate bringing food back, I'm not that person but today I asked them to remake my salad. The manager was super friendly and remade it no problem. I must have apologized to him twenty times but I appreciate the great customer service from the staff."}
{"text":"I am a regular at cafe rio and this is my second time at this location. My first experience was great, second, not so much. I waited in line and watched the guy preparing people's food and he seemed very over the idea of working and all customer service seemed to go out the window. He didn't ask any questions and seemed irritated the whole time. I asked for simple things like a salad with no tortilla and the rice and beans on the side which wasn't even the normal amount they give. Then for my husband I asked for a veggie burrito with both beans and all he put was beans on the tortilla and I had to request rice. I have worked in the customer service industry for 12 years and I'm aware that everyone has bad days but someone like him should not be working the front line, he should be in the back preparing the sides or cooking the meat. The manager was super nice and I wasn't going to say anything but my step mom went up to talk to him anyways and he came over to apologize even though I said I would never come back to this location. He didn't offer me a coupon or anything, which is fine but they should really teach their workers how to be friendly and ask what people want. Now a days there is a lot of people with dietary restrictions and instead of waiting food, they should be asking people how they want their food. I will not be back"}
{"text":"Amazing food that is made fresh! Love love the shredded chicken in a burrito, quesadilla, or salad. My boys love the steak and my husband enjoys the sweet pork."}
{"text":"My wife loves to go to Cafe Rio. I on the other hand tolerate it. Like others have said the restaurant is small, barely any seating at all. Went there last night very disappointed. 7:30 at night and there's no horchata. Let the staff know and it was never refilled during our entire dining time. When questioning the manager as we were leaving he stated that someone was working on it now. They had an employee closing umbrellas and thing trash. But apparently it took a half hour for an employee to make the horchata mix. Sorry I'm unimpressed!"}
{"text":"Check out cafe rios website, bomb.com that's all I'm gonna say about that. When you come best try the sweet pork barbacoa, they keep that meat on fleek. The employees are super friendly here and always keep this shop above standards. Keep it up cafe rio"}
{"text":"The food was decent; I ordered the taco special with pork and beef, and had a key lime pie. It's comparable to Chipotle, as some have mentioned.

The drinks were good--I recommend the mint limeade for sure if you enjoy \"no-jitos!\"

The service needs more organization. I wasn't give clarity on flour or corn tortillas, and after they heated my tacos, they ended up on two different plates and mixed up with someone else's order in line. Then it was unclear who I talked to for salsa and toppings (one person only did salsa, apparently, even though the toppings were not near the other staff member). It was dinner time, but the service felt rushed and impersonal (because instead of ordering tacos with everything, I had to repeat my order 4 times down the line).

I wouldn't come again, but it's good for a quick bite on taco Tuesday"}
{"text":"Ok so I love their salads.  That's what the three stars are for. The service is hit and miss. Tonight I went in there and the guy (no name tags) was not friendly at all. I think he was more concerned about ogling some lady with a hefty chest that was eating there. Anyway, I almost gagged because while he leaned forward to get some of the food, his NASTY apron (specifically the apron strings) touched my food. I mean... his apron was filthy. I wish I could have said something on the spot, but I couldn't bring myself to say anything. So now I have a salad that I won't eat. I know... I should have said something. Oh well... hopefully the manager will see this and remind his/her employees to be friendly, have CLEAN aprons on, and be nice. Oh - and LISTEN to what the person is ordering so I don't have to repeat myself."}
{"text":"This was the worst Cafe Rio, maybe even one of the worst managed restaurants I've been to this far. My family of 5 and I walked in and immediately noticed there was a shortage of seats. Several of the employees were sitting in those needed seats. Then, I was standing in line and had just ordered my taco platter.  The guy who does the toppings allowed someone behind me to pass me up thus I had to wait an additional 15 minutes. All I observed were employees goofing around, lounging back,  letting full trash cans  get even more full and let the ice maker empty. The employees looked unclean, grungy, and acted very unprofessionally. I counted at least 12 employees in this small restaurant doing nothing but socializing and laughing at each other while the trash can still continued to get full. The funny thing is two of the employees were sitting right next to the trash cans and never said a word or did anything about it even after setting a tray full of left overfood right in front of them. I am definitely never going back to this place again. 

You would think for a restaurant that is newly opened, the employees would be on their best behavior and the restaurant would run somewhat like a well-oiled machine. 

Judge for yourself"}
{"text":"I work in the same plaza and my coworkers always eat here so I gave it a try. Unfortunately I only took a bite and noticed a small beetle in my food  I had about 10 min to eat before my next client so I didn't have time to take it back so I went the rest of the day hungry. I gave 2 stars because the customer service was great. But will not be back."}
{"text":"I visited Cafe Rio a couple days ago and I got the nachos. The service was terrible and they acted like they did not even want to serve me. When I was eating the nachos, they were cold and paying the amount I paid I did not want to just throw it away. About 30 min later, my stomach started to hurt and I was throwing up for the rest of the night. I then got food poisoning the next four days. I do not recommend this location and their food. Never again!"}
{"text":"Honestly,  I never had a so-called \"desire\" to try Cafe Rio,  but when this one opened close to my home,  I HAD to try it. Boy was it good!!! Actually,  not good,  but great. I got the enchilada style fire-grilled chicken burrito with rice and beans.  Best damn burrito I've had in a while (sorry Las Santisima, I still love you though). The queso dip,  I mean THE QUESO DIP! Heaven in a cup with tortilla chips.  I would recommend anyone to try Cafe Rio out,  it won't disappoint. 

The only down side I would take from this wonderful building of great food,  is that the inside seating is cramped and there's not many  tables to seat more than 40ish people. But they do have an outdoor seating area which isn't all bad. But regardless,  I would eat on the floor if I had to this place is that great."}
{"text":"Since they opened almost 2 months ago I was going to give this location 4 1/2 stars until last week when I went to the Arrowhead location every other week this big Caucasian-American guy was an utterly ignorant person.  I ordered a quesadilla entree (at first I asked for wheat tortilla which looked store-bought & he claimed they were not, he is in denial so I ended up with the white) which comes with guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, salsa fresca, pico & I usually ask for more sour cream MINUS the guacamole.  He was a dick wad telling me I could only have 1 scoop of sour cream then he argued with me to order guacamole.  I said no!  Ignoramus!  Can't he get it thru his thickskull that sour cream costs less than guacamole.  I chose sour cream bc they already put pico mixed with the guamacole.  DUH!  Why would I want more pico!!!   That is not a lot in a quesadilla entree especially at the price of almost $10 and he put less chicken that his co-workers did in the past several weeks."}
{"text":"Have really been wanting to try this place for a while now. I asked how big the nachos were and he immediately just started making them.  Barely said a word,  and had to get 3 different employees attention to add things to my nachos. No one had any customer service there. Even after we paid,  they let our tray sit behind the counter til I had to ask for it.  They try so hard to be Mexican food,  but are so far from it. The shredded chicken had a good taste but was hardly shredded,  the chunks were huge. The chips seemed store bought.. the queso tasted like plastic. The cilantro was all still connected to one giant stem. The kids quesadilla was so microscopic. There are too many amazing Mexican places for this one to survive. Husband wasn't impressed either."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food! Small, quaint place with friendly staff. 

I suggest you try any burrito enchilada style for an extra special dish! Also, don't pass up the nachos and save room for the tres leches cake!! Delish!!

{"text":"The food was great but service was awful.. the lines are so long and employees are rushing around and orders get mixed up. They seem rushed and overwhelmed."}
{"text":"It took 15+ minutes for the eight people ahead of me to place their order. I placed my order, out of product. Quoted 5 more minutes, at minute 3 mark I quickly realized it's wasn't going to happen. Slow service! Charged the wrong price; the staff was unwilling to correct the issue. Cafe Rio is excellent on the East side; this location falls completely short of expectations!!

Update: Steve, the manager, contacted me. He explained how the restaurant was short handed that day. I'm willing to give it a second go. I'll update my review after the next visit. Thank you Steve for the quick response."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a quick bite , new place for me . Food taste was very good ! All the staff looked like they really enjoy the job all big smiles ( Thank you for that !) I had the taco Tuesday special , you basically add your ingredients , they do charge for sour cream :/ , Restaurant is pretty small , the only reason why I am giving them a 4 star is for the Speed of service , from the time that I order my taco to the time of paying almost 10-15min. Maybe is because it's a new place , but definitely I will be back ! And for sure for taco Tuesday ! Also thanks for keeping that kitchen clean:)"}
{"text":"It's so hot in this restaurant, and got snapped at by the employees, one girl was scraping the bottom of the rice so it was all dry and crusty. Expensive for what you get and honestly such sub par food. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty cramped quarters and not \"cozy\" cramped. And good luck with your take-out order: you'll probably come home to find they completely messed things up."}
{"text":"Update. Second time we tried the daily special of tostadas. They were okay but not very good. The tortills should be crunchy, right? Not these. Stick with the tacos."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio recently opened up next to my place so I stopped by for lunch one day. It was during lunch hours and it was busy and slightly overwhelming. There wasn't too many options: salads, tacos, quesadillas, burritos.

I decided to go with the quesadilla. Their chicken choices were grilled chicken and shredded chicken. Unfortunately the grilled chicken was $1 more. Very unfortunate being Chipotle doesn't charge extra for their chicken..

The food line workers were rushed to serve the foods and the food trays easily got mixed up in the line. My friends burrito got lost way up front in the line and the people in front of her, their food was after hers. I don't know what happened. The guy making the quesadilla behind them tosses the trays up in whatever position and so there I can see where things get messy. 

Overall, the food to me was decent but the price was on the higher end, in my opinion. This wouldn't be a regular go-to for me, but more so like a once a month or so kind of thing."}
{"text":"I waited 27 minutes for food and I was so disappointed. For starters throughout the process of getting my food me I could never hear what the workers were saying. Even when it's loud in the restaurant workers need to be even louder. There is probably 11 people behind the counter and only three of them working the line and register. I got the green chili pork and it was pretty much flavorless. They also chant when you order certain items but you don't know what they're saying and it's more of a distraction than a fun activity! I'm very disappointed in the slow service and lack of flavor!"}
{"text":"We loved the bogo deal they had going on for their opening. Their customer service is great. They all have a great attitude and are pretty quick at making your food. Also very clean and their house dressing is amazing."}
{"text":"The food here is gross. Fake enchiladas and very nasty tasting sauce. Enchiladas are wrapped in a flour tortilla and they pour the sauce inside and outside.They put so much enchilida sauce that when I opened the enchilida it ran and it looked like the meat was floating in the sauce. The enchilida sause tastes like it came from a can and almost taste like syrup. 

I notified the staff about the meal and they exhanged the plate for a chicken quesadilla. There was so much cheese in the quesadilla that grease was dripping out. 

You can get a quick bite to eat but this is very low quality food. I wouldn't recommend a foodie to eat here. You will be very disappointed."}
{"text":"Just went here and the food was excellent way better then chipotle. I had 3 steak tacos and the tortillas were amazing. We also enjoyed the mint lemonade it was very refreshing. I would highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I've had A LOT of Cafe Rio in my time. This location was terrible the first few months it was opened so I stopped going and drove an extra ten minutes to go to Happy Valley. I don't know what happened, but Arrowhead does a much better job now and the food is great! My only complaints is there isn't enough seating and every few times I go, the side tortillas just aren't good. I'm glad they turned this location around. Cafe Rio is amazing! Some of my favorite things to get: Sweet pork burrito with mild sauce with a side of creamy tomatillo, hatch Chile pork burrito with habanero sauce, sweet pork salad, and sweet pork quesadilla dipped in creamy tomatillo."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened here. Other locations seem very good at the concept... simple, fast kinda Mexican food. Unfortunately, this location has become just awful. It started off very good. Then, the last time we came here, the manager was complaining openly to the customers about his employees that didn't show up to work. The service and food was obviously bad, but you knew things were awry so I gave it a pass. 
Today was actually worse. The daily special, a Mexican pasta, was served cool and tasteless. A taco was delivered with some meat shoved onto one end. And a chicken quesadilla came with a plop of brown guacamole that took away any remaining appetite. We waited for 10 minutes after getting the food to get our chips. It was bad from start to finish. 
So disappointing. Waited so long for a west side location and we got this... a poor imitation of a good restaurant."}
{"text":"I LOVE Cafe Rio, but had never been to this location. I actually didn't even k ow it was here until today when I was shopping at a nearby store. I was surprised to walk in to such a small location. It's definitely not like the one I'm used to in Avondale, but there was plenty of tables to eat outside and one left just for me and my friend Inside. I am literally obsessed with the shredded chicken burrito and always get it enchilada style with green sauce. I add rice and black beans inside as well. This burrito is huge so I usually end up taking it home and eating basically a second meal lol. Today we also ordered chips and salsa to share. If you download their app they can scan your phone to earn points for free meals etc. today I had $10 on it so I got my meal for free. This location was ok. Employees were quick and friendly, but as I said earlier it's a small location so I'm assuming at lunch time since it's so close to the mall and all other popular stores it's pretty packed during those times. We went around 2pm on a Wednesday afternoon and it was already pretty busy."}
{"text":"I've always loved Cafe Rio, so was psyched when I found out they were opening this location so close to my house! I love their food and on my first visit here last month, I was impressed with the energy from all the staff. Everybody seemed so excited to work there and knew what they were doing even though they had only been in business for less than a month. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Sweet chili pork tacos are fantastic. Love that the kids quesadilla are free. Going to be coming here a lot more often! All of there food is delicious and very fresh. Way better than chipotle"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! So freaking excited to have one closer. Everything on the menu is fantastic and especially the different drink options. Great portion sizes and delicious flavors!!"}
{"text":"First let me start I truly like their food.   With that said the cleanliness here is out of control.  I thought maybe because they are busy but we've visited three separate times and the food prep area is the messiest I've ever experience.  My perception is they don't take pride in what they do.    I'm posting this as a wake up call to their leadership and a reminder no matter how busy it is there is always time to clean."}
{"text":"Sooo Good!!! My friend and I had spicy green chile burritos, they were excellent. It was very busy but the staff was quick and very friendly. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I've never experienced worse customer service. Completely unprofessional employees, even the \"manager\" more concerned about serving their friends and showing each other videos than making a to-go order. Does it take over 20 minutes to make one burrito? Apparently at this place it does. Entirely disorganized with rude employees. Just go to Chipotle ,Cafe Rumba, or frankly anywhere else...don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Unlike the cafe rio in Avondale, the tortillas are always doughy, sticky and underdone here, never flaky and crispy like nearby Avondale's; I couldn't even eat them!  The tortilla makers here must have fallen asleep during class.  There's never enough seating and the staff are unfamiliar with how the other Cafe Rios serve their food! I came the last time during when no one was here at 4pm and they were out of guacamole & cilantro and the seats/tables were dirty!  They charge extra for dressing & fresca here unlike Avondale.  The only thing that is right is the cutlery and condiments counter is always stocked.  Tried it 4 times, unlikely coming back."}
{"text":"Let's see...where to begin.

First off, the food here is absolutely delicious. It's fresh, warm when it needs to be warm, cold when it needs to be cold and the atmosphere is a lot of fun. The customer service is top notch as well as the team will always see to it you're happy with your order...when you order in house.

But...

When it comes to call-ahead orders (i.e. via their website/app), this particular location has never ever once gotten one of our many orders right.

Just last Thursday night, I stopped by there to pick up an order my wife had sent in. I went in and grabbed it, drove the 30mins home and when me and my family sat down to eat, we were once again reminded about the lack of quality control this place suffers from.

My order was relatively simple: Steak salad with shredded chicken and all the fixings without the tortilla. Got home and the salad had steak, lettuce, pico and guac. No chicken, no beans, no rice, no cheese, no lime.

My wife's order was even easier: Steak salad with all the fixins, no tortilla. Her salad had steak, lettuce, pico and guac. No beans, no rice, no cheese, no lime.

I reviewed the online order, compared it to the receipt and the little stickers on both of our salad containers and all the information was correct.

I'm thinking whoever was making the orders saw \"No Tortilla\" and incorrectly assumed everything from that point forward was also a \"no\".

I did a quick peek into the bag before I left, saw the salads and figured I was good to go...I shouldn't have to open up each meal, dig to the bottom of the container and verify the order is correct.

So...we essentially paid full price for what amounted to be two side salads- no bueno.

This isn't an isolated incident with this particular Cafe Rio- we have called in two separate orders and on both occasions, the orders have been grossly incorrect. The place lacks quality control and for that reason, online orders are sent out the door without any kind of verification system.

All of this is just my opinion (obviously)- but I think this particular location suffers from a high rate of employee turnover which leads to incorrect orders. It's a bummer because the quality of the food is so good that I/we would be willing to spend a few bucks more if it meant the establishment would do what they can to keep trained staff there.

It's really become such a disappointing hassle that until we read otherwise, we're opting to drive the additional 5-10mins to the one north of here for our future to-go orders.

For what it's worth, I worked in the food industry for several years and I understand that it's not uncommon for to-go orders from places to come missing something here or there. This was an entirely different matter- the \"bulk\" of our food was left out and it should have been caught by staff."}
{"text":"Came to this new location to try it out & it was such a great experience!!!!! Vicky on the register was so sweet with such a big smile to greet you with & the assistant manager Sherman treats all the guests & employees in a kind manner!!! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. This Mexican chain started in Utah and its tentacles continue to grow. I must say, the food is extremely tasty and it always hits the spot. I love the sweet barbecue tacos and spicy beef tacos as well. The house dressing is the bomb and I order a flour tortilla and treat it like a corn chip for dipping in the liquid gold. This place is a win, try it, I really think you will enjoy it here. They also have a reward program that helps out with the bill."}
{"text":"Decent food, terrible service. Let me start with the cleanliness and food safety. No one should be running the register, touching debit cards and cash, answering the cell phone/taking orders and working with customers with their food prep gloves on. They just go back to touching the food behind the line! Disgusting. 

The line is extremely long so every time I've ordered online the order has been terribly wrong (missing items, adding items) and when I arrive to pick it up after the \"promised time\" it's lost or not ready yet. Honestly it seems so simple- people order online and spell out exactly what they want and you still can't get it right. My most recent experience- I placed my order at 6:20, I scheduled my order for  7:15. Neither of my orders were ready when I arrived at 7:18- They rang me up took my cash and I waited until 7:39 before they handed me my food. I ordered 40 minutes in advance so that wouldn't happen!  I would have been better off waiting in the line behind 20 people. I get home and realized that half of the salad ingredients weren't in my salad!! I paid $10 for lettuce, pico and chicken. I should have just made it at home myself. Never again."}
{"text":"Food is ok. You get a lot for what you for. This place is a lot like Chipotle but with more variety. When you go through the line the staff makes you feel very rushed. Since this was our first visit we wanted to ask some questions. They answered very quickly without much details. My wife ordered salad. They put the salad in a tortilla. The first thing they add is beans and rice and meat on top of the gorilla making it hard to get last the leatuce. 
The worst thing about this location is that they only have 5 tables. 3 4 seaters 2 2 seaters and 8 bar type of seats not enough for a busy restaurant like this."}
{"text":"I ordered food on Tuesday the 21st. Only to arrive with my food not ready at the time I had requested I stood there for a while and hope that somebody would help me I was greeted but never assisted. I decided to stand in line where I was asked what can I get? I simply told him that I was picking up and he said to stand over at the pick up area. Where I had been standing for 10 minutes already. The manager proceeded to tell me that he never received my food order, while all along it was sitting on the other end of the table. Just not being made. The manager had told me that it was not the call center that it was their fault that evening. Today on the 24th I decided to try again in hopes that maybe the service would be better. I decided to call it in because the first time I made it I had done an online order well I proceeded to place my order. Explain to the woman my situation Tuesday was really discouraging and how it there was a mistake on my order today I would no longer be a patron of your establishment because this is the third time it's happened. I work for a salon so I order bigger orders so online ordering is the only way I can do it without being stressed out in line in the store. I placed my order and the woman on the other end gave me a total when I came and picked up my order, I live in Arizona and this week is been over 120 I told the woman at the call center to make them triple check my food before I left. Taking her word for it I decided to just pay for my food grab the bags and go. One of the meals I had ordered was not on there I returned back to my salon short one meal so one of my stylist was very upset that she did not receive her food. The manager has said that he would be happy to comp one of my meals, however with all of the mistakes that I've had with every time that I've gone to your establishment. I don't feel comfortable that that is even suffice. When every single time we come there are orders have been over $40 and someone's order is always missing or has mistakes."}
{"text":"I can't believe how good the food is Here. Every time I get cafe rio at this location, I'm pleased. It's new & clean, employees are nice and they give you a lot of food for your money, I recommend the salad with everything and the burritos are also major yum!"}
{"text":"If you have read my reviews lately, you obviously know that I love Cafe Rio.  I swear to God I am going to turn into a Nacho if I keep eating here.  I can't resist!  Their nachos are the best!  Me and my son decided to head on down here to try out this one for lunch.  I won't bore you with another nacho review, but I did have a few things to point out for this Cafe Rio here at Arrowhead.

1.  This place is incredibly small!  Way, way, way too small for their location near Arrowhead.  If this was in some far off strip mall in Buckeye or something, it might be fine.  For the hustle and bustle around Arrowhead though, this may have been the worst design plan ever!  No joke, there are maybe 5 tables in the restaurant and a couple of high bar stools along the windows.  That is it!  When I walked inside, I became claustrophobic immediately!  Their line is maybe about 7 feet long and can maybe fit 10 people in it at most.  The rest of the line was spilling out into the dining area (which is small as fuck to begin with!) and you almost had to watch to make sure your ass wasn't in someones face that was trying to enjoy their lunch.  Horrible set up.  I knew that we were going to wind up sitting outside (it was alright...in the shade at least, and not too hot.).

2.  Their nachos were skimp!  Usually, Cafe Rio hooks up the tin tray with overflowing chips.  This one didn't even fill them to the top.  Granted, they are STILL a decent size, but they were the skimpest nachos I have ever seen from Cafe Rio.  They tasted good at least, but it was definitely less quantity than normal.  My son enjoyed his Nino quesadilla (I love that they do this!  Free cheese quesadilla for kids under 6!).

Service and staff were fine, but I am never coming back to this one.  It is such a clusterfuck inside there, it's not worth the stress and hassle to get food here.  The one further down on Bell and 9th is twice the size as this one and way less crowded.  It is totally worth the drive to any other Cafe Rio in town just to avoid this tiny shack.  You have been warned lol ;-)."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed. First off it took 35 minute to get a salad. It was very unorganized. They kept mixing up my order with the couple in front of me and the girl behind me. And They didn't put my salad dressing in my bag when I checked out. It was not worth the $12.00. 
To top it off one of the kids that was helping me, it was clearly one of his first days on the job, his team members were extremely rude to him and clearly very outwardly annoyed with his mistakes. We've all had a new job, we all make mistakes, he was clearly trying. There was no need to be rude. Most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my third time eating at a Cafe Rio. I had an absolutely fantastic experience my first two times, however today was less than amazing. Place was dirty, disorganized/messy, and the staff was more concerned about singing together when somebody ordered a special item and they were about paying attention to the customers. I will probably give this store a second try because I really loved my first two visits to a Cafe Rio. However, I hope these posts are read by Cafe Rio leadership and that they look into this because there seems to be several posts about the same issues.

I was a bit perplexed when I just spent $20 in food and went up to get a side of salsa for my daughter's tacos and they charged me a dollar. Not very good customer service here."}
{"text":"Portion is extremely SMALL and food is SALTY. Server very mindful of how much she puts in the big ass aluminum container as if there's not enough room. Definitely will not come back and waste money on this place."}
{"text":"Well, for a Mexican restaurant, this place is pretty good. The meat is very good and flavorful. And just amazing! I love it! This is only my second time here, and I'm satisfied  like I was the last time I visited."}
{"text":"Outstanding service always. Steve is the overall leader as best as I can tell, perhaps the owner / manager but his team response to his guidance."}
{"text":"Busy, but they just opened so I wouldnt expect anything less. Steak quesadilla was great. The perfect portion. Ill definitely be back."}
