{"text":"La Rocca has the most delicious cheesecakes that are so light and creamy! They have such a distinguishable taste compared to other cheesecakes I've tried before. I wish I had the recipe!"}
{"text":"I can't believe no one wrote a review for this place yet. They have the absolute most delicious cakes in all of the GTA. We ordered a large Strawberry Shortcake for our wedding because it was that good. Moist, light, fruity and not overly sweet. Perfect perfect cake."}
{"text":"Great little cafe inside of Cosmo music. They had Yule logs on sale and other tasty pastries to tempt tastebuds. The lava cake and pecan tart were both excellent choices.  Next time I will preorder a red velvet cake."}
{"text":"Very small coffee bar in cosmo, unfortunately it was close at Saturday 17:00. I don't think I will be back again, it's not worth to go there specifically."}
{"text":"Great coffee.  Cute, tasteful set up.  Sinfully rich dessert.  Come for a break; you deserve a glimpse of European R&R.  The 1-star deduction is because they changed the opening hours unannounced.  The operating hours on weekend have been shortened sometime in summer 2015.  To this date, the new hours are not posted at store, or printed on its business card, or posted on website and Facebook."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with their delicious cakes. Recently discovered their limited edition Greatest Hits which is so good! And not many people know that they have a cafe in the Cosmo Music store in Richmond Hill. Must go!"}
{"text":"Love to grab a latte when at Cosmo. Recently picked up a fresh baked blueberry cheesecake for $28. Aged the cake two days and it was absolutely delicious.  Manager at the store was so helpful. Any time I need a cake in the future I will consider them. We are at Cosmo weekly."}
{"text":"Their cakes are amazing and economical. I've ordered one for every occasion and has always been a fan. The service at the cafe is amazing as well. The gentleman went the extra mile to check if he had a whole cake for us in the back when he found out we wanted to order one but couldn't pick it up on the weekdays. Needless to say, the brownie cheesecake we ended up getting is my new favourite cake."}
{"text":"La Rocca Cafe is located at the atrium area inside Cosmo Music.   You can get La Rocca's pastry in a lot of major supermarket and their baking factory is just across the street. Here you can order cakes for pick up. And of course there are slices of cake to purchase.  The sit down area though smallish but quite quiet on a weekday afternoon when the store is not busy.   Espresso drinks are well prepared.   Worth dropping by if you are in the area. And for sure if you are shopping at Cosmo Music."}
{"text":"great cafe with all LA rocca creative cakes. I tried the cinanmon brown sugar latte here and it was good"}
