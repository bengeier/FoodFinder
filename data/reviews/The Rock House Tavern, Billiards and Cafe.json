{"text":"Had a great time listening to the great variety of music from hip hop to blue grass.  Great place open late.  Bartender was happy to get you a drink."}
{"text":"NO CONCEALED CARRY...  Saw this sign on the front door.  They do not support a persons right to carry concealed, thus giving them the ability to protect themselves and their family.  I decided to take my business to Steak and Shake.  I will not be attending bike night, and I will make sure that CBA along with SOH know of the non protection policy.  There was no problem with two felons shooting at each other a couple of weeks ago, who WERE CARRYING ILLEGALLY.  Rock House, DID They obey your no carry sign?  Thus your management endangered EVERYONE present that night."}
{"text":"This place is about as good as it gets in Gastonia. They always book great bands. The food there is pretty good too. It's a fun friendly place to play some pool, listen to music and tilt a few cold ones. They have enough security to make sure everyone has a good safe time. This place welcomes all walks of life so your may run into the person that did your last tattoo or the person that did your taxes for the last 10 years. I added them on Fb to see their lineup."}
{"text":"SOOOOO...It seems to me like this establishment was the scene of shoot-out  between TWO FELONS whom  ignored this establishment's gun-free zone barring the Law Abiding Citizens that are registered Conceal Carry to cross their threshold.. This will be one place that I will never spend my money at..I for one will only spend my money at the places that accept Us Law Abiding Citizens to cross their thresholds.."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. No trouble around like you see at some places. They keep a good crowed of regulars but anyone with decent social skills can make a good night there."}
{"text":"Read the food was really good so ordered a pizza and the kitchen came out and asked if three meat was OK cause if we wanted just pepperoni  he would have to pick the other meat off cause it's digourna (or however u spell it)would not recommend the pizza....lol....may come back for bike not but not the food....."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, pool tables u can reserve per hour or $1 per play which will probably work out cheaper unless u r really good.  Also has bean bag throwing, cornhole. Believe there r leagues during the week.  I went during the week which there wasn't a band but place is a large size in which looks like a load of fun. This is a real local spot but I ran into no issues. From the outside doesn't look like much but fairly large once u get in.  Seems they have some serious leaking issues when u look up at ceiling in one of the side pool rooms. They should look into getting repaired as I did notice some black mold.  I would recommend this place n defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Gave this place 3 chances. 2 out of the 3 times, there was a fist fight. The last time was right beside my car. It's a hole. You have to wait for a luke warm beer from the bartenders. UGH."}
{"text":"Totally adorable place and a life saver as we got in late from Atlanta and wanted a drink to relax and unwind...only bar open!! Thank goodness it is such a cool place! I would call this a must visit place in the area!"}
{"text":"Don't like this place much. The bartenders have never been too friendly. And they don't have Jameson. Good place to shoot pool bc they have a bunch of tables but don't plan on going back"}
