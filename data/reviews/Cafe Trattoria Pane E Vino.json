{"text":"Overall: This place is average.  The food was ok, the service was ok, the ambiance is ok.

Food: Decent Italian food.  I had the lasagna, and it was fine.  Nothing mindblowing, but certainly an acceptable lunch.  Same for the soup.

Price: At $14-$20 for lunch, this is a typical decent-but-overpriced Old Montreal lunch place.

Conclusion: You can have a good lunch here.  3 stars because there's nothing outstanding or unique about it."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot across the street from my office and 2 blocks down from the Notre-Dame Basilica.

They are purely a lunch spot, catering to a crowd looking for something cheap, cheerful, and good.  They have two different eating experiences - if you are coming in for take-out, just go up to the counter and pick out what you'd like.  You'll do better to sit down and have a good and quick meal at one of the snug yet comfortable tables.  

The owner/maitre d' is a jovial and gregarious Italian gentleman, who will gladly recommend whatever special he has that day, although the waiter can be a bit...curt.  The food is comprised of basic staple Italian fare, with good soups, pasta, and meat dishes.  Standouts are the calamari fritti and manicotti, although their specials on the meat side never disappoint.

Finally, if you like a bit of heat to your food, be sure to ask for \"La Bomba\".  I don't know what's in it, and my nose twitches in recollection.  I could only appreciate about two drops' worth on a piece of bread, although a colleague of mine who loves spice enjoyed every bite (notwithstanding the beads of sweat on his forehead)."}
{"text":"Really outstanding Italian food.  Pasta was very fresh and the red pasta sauce was amazing.  Easiest 5 star so far.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a fantastic little spot in old Montreal. This was suggested to us by our lawyer. And not knowing if she was a foodie or not I was hesitant. Well DAMN! Just the Caprese Salad alone insured my return. Perfect balance of cheese and tomato versus the tangy dressing... just perfect. Followed by dipping some bread in to soak in the left over dressing in the bowl. I had the lasagna - for some reason I just wanted one - and it was very very good but no where near the Coq au Vin my girlfriend had which was just amazing, the chicken was served with delicious pasta sauced only with the drippings from the Coq au Vin and served with grilled veggies. And the pastries are from one of the best pastry shops in Montreal...if not Qu√©bec, Alati's in Little Italy.

The service needs a little finesse considering the type of clientele that eats there but it doesn't seem to bother the patrons that left no chair free, the place was packed and for a good reason. The food is simply awesome. For a trattoria, they make pretty upscale grub and that's fine with me."}
