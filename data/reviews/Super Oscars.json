{"text":"I've been going to this place for 10 years, ever since it was originally called Armando's. The only thing I ever get here is their \"Armando's Breakfast Burrito\" which is fabulous. Fresh eggs, thick cut bacon, cheddar cheese and potatoes wrapped in a nice warm tortilla. My favorite Mexican breakfast burrito in town!"}
{"text":"I grab a breakfast burrito here once a week or so, and they are generally pretty good w decent quality ingredients and an excellent tortilla. 

Add tomatoes, onions and jalape√±os to whatever burrito you order. Totally upgrades them. 

Not sure what other reviewers expect, but this is a solid fast-Mexican joint. Not special, but solid and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place used to be called Armando's.
I haven't been to the new Super Oscars.
But in it's previous life as Armando's the food was good. The beans (without lard) we're always good never greasy the tortillas although not freshly made were not bad. And I recall getting chicken tacos and they were always tasty. As Armando's it was open 24 hrs. We tended to go after 10 or 11 pm and their was always a few people dinning in and the drive thru was constantly busy. They had a good salsa bar and it was always well maintained. 3 different salsas, pickled carrots,onions and jalapenos.  radishes, cucumbers, limes and lemons.
I can only hope  Super Oscars is as good as when it was Armando's."}
{"text":"This place sucks, people that came in 20 mins after me got their food. We got called up twice to say it's not ours."}
{"text":"Got the fajitas to go.

Rubbery chicken, no onion or peppers, bland.

Other than the tortilla which is definitely fresh everything tastes canned 

My last time tryouts by these guys - it used to be better!"}
{"text":"Decent place, tables were wiped clean and service was good. I got a huge burrito for only $5.75 and I chowed that puppy down. Kinda bland not much flavor so I doused it with hot sauce and all was good"}
{"text":"The food here is what it is for cheaply made Mexican fast food. I had the displeasure of trying to get through my chili rellano meal before I tossed it in the trash can. They chilis were cold, the cheese was solid (not melted) and it was piled high with so much iseless garbage that you couldn't enjoy the flavors that should have been there. The service was terrible and the price was a little bit much. I think I will stick to Filibertos if I want quick and easy. At least the have lengua and they serve soft shelled tacos."}
{"text":"Omg. This was my drive thru meal. Wow when I got home it was still a chart picture. And delicious too. This was the #13 Chile rellenos. Good stuff. And the green Chile burrito is yummy aswell. It's definitely worth any drive thru line, luckily there wasn't one today    Try it, I think you will like it. Mmmmm mmmm good."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Seriously the best Mexican food I've ever had and I've traveled the world! It's a hole in the wall, but don't let it scare you. The service is also great and they are always nice. They take their sweet time to make sure your food is exactly what you ordered."}
{"text":"I go here a lot for the fast service and convenient hours. There is never a line or noisy people, the lobby is open late so when I work late I can still get my order inside due to long drive thru line on certain days. They also have a daily special. The only issue I can think of is I have to always request lemon with my order instead of them just giving me it but that's pretty much it."}
{"text":"its hole in the wall Mexican, greasy and salty.  It really is only meant to be drunk food."}
{"text":"Super Oscars is awesome! The food is freakishly delicious. We have been dining here for nearly 4 years and never had a bad meal.   Then we moved to Tempe, but we drive back at least once a week to get our Oscars fix."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Way better than some of the more expensive Mexican restaurants for half the price."}
{"text":"Super Oscars it's great at noon, midnight, morning, dinner, anytime! 
I love this place. Good inexpensive delicious food. I've been here probably a total of 14 times. Besides then forgetting to not pot any onions on my mini tacos, (which I just picked them out myself) I really like this place."}
{"text":"The food quality is below expectations. I ordered a carne asada burrito and the meat tasted leftover and flavorless and the pico de gallo wasn't fresh. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"There are few places that can evoke the pure joy that I get when I walk into Super Oscars. Super Oscars, or as my track team has dubbed it \"Armandos\" for the world famous burrito that is served there, is the best restaurant in the country, world, and likely universe. There is a large menu at Super Oscars, but when you begin to look for what you want, you will feel a tug, maybe magic, that drags your eyes to one beautiful word, \"Armandos\". The Armandos Breakfast Burrito is not only a burrito, it is art. Each lovingly crafted Armandos Burrito is made with care, by wonderful chefs who want you to have a world-class dining experience. When you consume the tortilla, potato, egg, and bacon that make up the Armandos Burrito you will feel a sense of belonging in the world.  You might also hear a TV blaring in your ear, but this is all part of the experience. You will know that you were born to eat this burrito and you know you will eat it for the rest of your life.  Those that have consumed the Armandos Burrito are part of a tight-knit group of kin who all share one passion, the Armandos Burrito.  After you have consumed your burrito you will have two benefits, you will be full, but you will also have immunity against many different diseases. The immunity comes from the slightly sketchy kitchen that creates the Armandos Burrito. Do not fear, no one has had serious consequences from eating an Armandos. I hope that you will one day have the chance to consume the best breakfast burrito in the universe. After you do eat your first Armandos you may say, \"Hey, I could eat another!\" Be warned, \"the double\" as it is called can seem easy, but when you begin on that treacherous journey it will seem easy until you hit \"the wall\" at about 3/4 of the second burrito. The double has only been achieved twice in living memory and the man who completed this had some of the worst hair ever seen. I wish you good luck on your Armandos journey and hope you can enjoy an Armandos burrito."}
{"text":"I'm heading out of town to explore the desert.  I don't have time to stop for dinner, I've got to meet people on the road.  Super Oscars is right on the way, so I swing in.  As the only customer in line, it takes the cashier chick a few minutes to locate me waiting patiently at her counter.  \"I'll have a Chicken Burrito and a Bean and Cheese Burrito - to go, please\".  She looks at me.  \"You want shredded chicken with that?; \"yeah, sure\", I say, \"however you make it\".  She rings me up.  I thought it was really cheap at less than seven dollars, but I had other things on my mind.

Five or so minutes later, my order is ready.  I look in the bag, there's only one burrito in it.  \"Excuse me\", I say, as she had already wandered off. \"I should have two burritos?\"  No, she says, you ordered chicken and bean burrito, staring at me with a vacant expression.  I give her an exasperated look - \"whatever, I don't have time for this.\"  grabbed my burrito and left.

The bean burrito was supposed to be my lunch for the next day.  The burrito I got with chicken, beans and cheese was a hefty sucker and did not taste all that bad.  Of course, I would have preferred what I ordered, and the next day, in the middle of the desert, I missed that bean burrito.

My advice, make sure the vacant chick repeats your order back.  Check your receipt to make sure she rings it up right.  Or, go someplace else with better ratings and decent service."}
{"text":"I avoided this place for a while. But seeing as I work in the Plaza I finally was convinced by a coworker to stop in for a breakfast burrito. 

I can't speak for the rest of the menu but I've found that they make a filling relatively good breakfast burritos for under five bucks. (sausage being my go to). 

After a couple visits I am definitely sold."}
{"text":"Super Oscar's took over Armando's.  A very similar menu.  The salsa bar is gone and tables added.  They provide red and green sauce in squeeze containers. 
I tried the streak breakfast burrito for $5.  It was decent.  It's better than the prior place."}
{"text":"its a typical Mexican food place off to the side of a somewhat remote parking lot off 40th street and Thomas. Dont expect spectacular service and do expect the possibility of some form of miscommunication. As for the food, well I only ever order the Carne Asada and the Adobada Burritos, which I believe are standard fare for this type of food....Its good enough for lunch...so no complaints."}
{"text":"Not bad. A pretty typical taco & burrito shop. The interior is basic, clean and comfortable. There's a drive-thru available. My first impressions were all very positive. Diverse menu. Reasonable prices. Friendly counter staff. Kids menu. Red and green sauce provided. Unfortunately, the grilled chicken taco I ordered for about three bucks was not at all good. Pretty tasty at first bite, but then I started encountering gristle/bone in volume. At least four or five bites. Not a good ratio, especially for their premium chicken taco offering. I simply ordered wrong. All the other items around the dining room looked appealing and were being enjoyed. 

I plan on returning and trying a few other items. That said, Maria's Frybread & Mexican Food is directly across the street, so it might be a while. Maria's has a $3 chicken taco that contains only white chicken breast. Plus they have frybread. And Maria in the kitchen! Even a drive-thru. All at a pretty comparable cost. Maria's also has a small amount of outdoor seating, which Super Oscar's does not. Maria's does have more limited hours, however, so Super Oscar's might be a fine alternative if you're in the area and Maria's is closed."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve one star!  Worst customer service.  They messed up my order, I drove back and they were not accommodating and blamed me for the wrong order.  Will NOT go back."}
{"text":"Crappy customer service, awesome, greasy Mexican food! Rolled tacos and pork tamales are the bomb. Go inside to order cus that speaker is always busted outside."}
