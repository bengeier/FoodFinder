{"text":"Great service.  Always!  They are very intuned with their customers and are a great help with disabled individuals who may need help both at the pump and in the store."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place, but it's gone downhill. The car vacuum is missing the attachment and the last time I tried it, it took my money and wouldn't work. When I went in to get change, there were two employees shouting across the store to each other. I'm not expecting it to be nice - I get that it's a gas station. But if you need literally anything but gas, I would pick anywhere else."}
{"text":"Carwash purchased which states the vehicle will be hand towel dried, but no attendants present to do the work!?!  It's just an expensive spin brush wash without this feature which is fitting because they also sell the most expensive fuel (gas) in Phienix.  Great location and appearance of the newly remodeled store is carrying this place."}
{"text":"Jacksons is better than quiktrip, great staff consistent and helpful. They help me start day the right way. They always remind me that my rock stars are two for 3. They know what I want when I come in. They always speak to me even though in the morning  know I look like an angry black man #jacksons"}
