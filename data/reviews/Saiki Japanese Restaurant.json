{"text":"STAY AWAY!!  The food was absolutely some of the worst I've eaten.  There is nothing Japanese about the cuisine.  Meat either overcooked or heated in a microwave.  Steak, chicken and shrimp with rubber consistency.  Vegetables overcooked.  Sushi didn't appear to be fresh.......Everything thrown in the garbage.  Wasted money!!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch today. It's located in a strip mall with other shops and restaurants. I ordered hibachi steak, which came with a soup or salad, and fried rice. Price was reasonable at $7.25. 

First, the salad. It was generic iceberg lettuce. The \"house\" dressing was actually a pretty good ginger dressing. For the type of place, the salad was acceptable. 

The hibachi was next. The food was ok. Really nothing spectacular. The rice was decent, meat was decent, veggies were overcooked and mushy. 

Overall, for $7, the meal was decent. Could have been cooked better. Overall the meal was ok."}
{"text":"Barf** i just ate the equivalent of salt from a salt shaker. Stay away from there flounder!! Actually no just don't come here it's just puke."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much when my family and I walked in, we were the only ones there but we are glad we stayed.  We were all very happy with our meals,  good service as well.  There were five of us eating and the bill was $51, can't beat that and leaving stuffed."}
{"text":"This is a go-to for me with our regular \"Daddy-Daughter Date!\" The ginger sauce on the salads is the best around. The service is very friendly and takes the time to remember their repeat customers orders! Restaurant is kind of small & does not specialize in sushi. But these are the little things that make this a great spot for really good Japanese food."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today. It was decent, not the best Japanese food I've had but not the worst either. It was pretty slow for it being lunch time (only two other people sitting down when I came in) 
The lunch menu is reasonable prices. I got the hibachi shrimp and a tea for less than $9. I believe the hibachi shrimp was about $6.50 (somewhere around there) as the last reviewer said the veggies were mushy, but the shrimp and rice were good and so was the shrimp sauce. Salad dressing was a little watery. If you are looking for a quick cheap lunch that is decent this is your place."}
{"text":"We came with our kids for an early dinner. Our first impression was underwhelming but the food saved it! The yakitori melts in your mouth. The pork shumai were amazing! The noodle dishes were good, but could have benefitted from more sauce. Overall excellent!"}
{"text":"I went here one time and they didn't speak English and the food was not good. I wish they could've helped me know what everything was better. I was ready to try new food."}
{"text":"Saiki is our quiet date night little gem! The ginger dressing is my absolute favorite and the hibachi chicken dinner is perfectly satisfying. If you are expecting a chic sushi joint - look elsewhere - but this spot serves up the best Japanese comfort food for an awesome deal and...$3.50 for a glass of wine. Plus, May is so kind and helpful!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice. The service was pretty good. Place is quiet and clean. Food was really tasty and well done. I like the fact they offer other options (Asian fusion) like Vietnamese food that I just recently tired for the first time and loved it as well as I enjoy Japanese and chinese. I would improve the decor. Make it more inviting. And always make sure the food is fresh. For instance the first time my chicken was 5 star. I could tell it was just made. Second time I wasn't so sure but it was still good. Planning to eat here again"}
