{"text":"Les nombreuses entrées que nous avons essayées étaient savoureuses mais minuscules, surtout pour le prix, donc pas idéal pour partager. Par contre, les soupes ramen nous ont étonnées de leur grande qualité et se sont prouvées particulièrement rassasiantes. Nous avons trouvé leur liste de cocktails est intéressante ce qui compense pour leur carte de vins et de bières qui l'est moins. J'ai emmené quelques amis souper à cet endroit et personne n'était déçu du repas.   Je n'ai jamais eu l'occasion d'essayer leurs bentos spéciaux du midi, mais les choix présentés semblaient fortement appétissants."}
{"text":"Decor was nice, but quickly got bored with it waiting in the long line. Service was slow, cold and forgetful. Appetizers were ok, but what put my experience down was the ramen. Ramen broth lacked any kind of flavor, the noodles soggy and pork portions were too few to remember. First time there, and last I think as well, not a place to enjoy authentic Japanese food. Went in with high hopes seeing all the great reviews on here, left hungrier than when I was seated. Don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"As I watched others eat I thought, \"Wow, once again I feel bad for all these Quebecois thinking they are eating authentic Japanese food.\" I give it three stars because for Montreal standards, it is edible ramen. It feels like they actually tried."}
{"text":"not authentic, period.  Waaaaay over priced for its ingredients and portion. Never trust those local quebec newspapers because they don't know much about asian food anyway and they haven't traveled or experienced much outside of quebec. Another word, they don't know what they are talking about.   Ordered the spicy octopus with cucumber. It came out like Chinese Szechuan side dish with lots of sesame oil in it. Cucumber was not even marinated. Any Chinese person could've made a much better version than that. $6 for tiny 5 pieces of octopus and 1/4 of a cucumber? Kidding me.   Gyoza was recommended by the waiter. Seriously?!  If you buy frozen leek dumplings from Korean supermarket for your restaurant, at least don't advertise it as \"recommendation item\". Japanese don't eat leek. Koreans do. $6 for 5 frozen dumplings for what I can buy the entire bag of them. You don't make dumplings from scratch it's no big deal, but just don't pretend people will not recognize it.   Finally, the ramen. I had the lobster miso broth. Lobster seafood flavoured MSG was heavily added coz I felt EXTREMELY thirsty afterward. Ramen was just average, not memorable.  Lack of ingredients of traditional ramen. Other local Isakayas had better ramen, not to mention those NYC places or in Japan.   FYI, my check was $73 for two ramens, that fantastic cucumber and gyoza and a 350ml drink. Could've had two courses much more promising French instead.   What a replica!  P.S.When diners review a restaurant, isn't food the most important? Yes you like the decor and the service, but you don't just pay to sit there and admiring the space unless you're in a museum."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere but overrated for average ramen. I would recommend Misoya instead for ramen."}
{"text":"We love ramen. From the cheap street food to high end fusion places. Saka-ba! just happened to be the closest place to where we just moved to in Montreal. I'm laughing with friends as I write this because it was sincerely the worst place we have ever been to. We thought we might have been on Just for Laughs. The decor tries to look high end but comes off cheap, the ramen is basically a worse version of Mr. Noodles with virtually no other ingredients regardless of what you order and tastes like what I always imagined Buster's Hot Ham Water tasted like on Arrested Development. We would happily spend even more than the $15 they charge for the dejeuner ramen, but this is at most a $5 place thought up by a few people who dreamt late one night they could spend $100 at IKEA decorating their forgettable food truck into a restaurant and trick 'foodies' into spending $15 on $0.50 worth of ingredients repeatedly. We understand why it's empty."}
{"text":"If you enjoy Westernized Asian food, you could skip my review. This review has written in an Original Japanese Ramen lover point of view. Although I lowered my standard since I'm in a Western country.  I liked Saka-Ba about half a year ago, but sadly, not anymore.  RAMEN I TRIED : Shoyu Ramen, Ebi Ramen  Noodle was just ok, Cha-siu was nice but a bit dry. The problem was their broth & topping. Both broths were salty, rootless & blended. It just lost it's way. Not what I had half a year ago. Shoyu's topping was fried onions but it's all burnt so it added a burnt taste to a broth & they used red onion.  I lost another Ramen spot..."}
{"text":"When I heard this place was opening, I was very excited, seeing pictures of the decor and how there are anime strips on the walls. In my head, the placed looked great and so was the food.  I then called to make a reservation for a group of friends of mine, and they told me they only take reservations for 8 or 12, and that the reservation comes with a fixed 35$ menu, which was not specified. I thought that was weird, and didn't find any information about group menus on their facebook page or other.  We decided to go nevertheless and we were happily surprised with what we got.  The group menu, for 35$, includes for each person, entrées of kimchi, edamame, sweet potato fries, yakitori (chicken brochettes), karaage (fried chicken), gyoza (dumplins) and bbq pork ribs served with potatoes. For the ramen, the shoyu ramen was given. For dessert, you can choose on the many flavors of homemade ice cream. I also tried their tiramisu flavored mochi, but it is not included in the group menu.  Food-wise, I was very impressed with the appetizers, especially the sweet potato fries. The ramen was lacking in flavor a bit, so it was ok for me. Service-wise, it was ok, but sometimes, I really couldn't understand what the waiter was saying to us. Also, we were seated on the same table as another small group, which I did not really enjoy. Furthermore, they made us wait around 10 minutes because people hadn't cleared our table yet even thought we reserved.  Overall, I think I might have expected a lot more from this place, but the quantity of food we got and nice appetizers were great."}
{"text":"Saka-Ba, I gave you a second chance.  In some ways, you redeemed yourself, in others, you're still working on it.  I have a feeling I'll need a third try to really get a feel for you.  The quality of food has definitely improved.  Perhaps it was an off night the first time I visited, because I see other reviews singing the praises of the ramen, and now I can add my voice to the choir.  This ramen was gooooood!  Nothing at all like the first time I visited.  We also split an order of the sweet potato fries, and yuuuuuum.  I'd come back here just for an order of fries and a beer.  Good stuff!  Now the not so good stuff: that ramen took forever to come out.  I'm not talking a few minutes longer than we would have liked because we were starving, I'm talking closer to an hour!  I get it that it was busy and the kitchen makes their own noodles.  But an hour for ramen is just too long.  Especially since no one even came to tell us it would be awhile, nor brought our drinks.  We actually never got our drinks, and then they came on the bills.  Oops.  Someone (a manager? he never did introduce himself) came over and offered us shots as we were leaving, but it was just too late at that point.  We were tired and all just wanted to go home.  Shots were the last thing we wanted.  But good stuff for at least attempted to make it right, I'll give them that.  So . . .  third time's a charm?"}
{"text":"Nouveau venu sur le Plateau. J'ai aimé mais sans plus. Les beignets porc et cari étaient délicieux mais pas enlevants. Le ramen au porc et soya était bon, mais sans plus.  Belle présentation, excellent service"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Saka-Ba while the season was still right.  I liked the decor, which could create a sense of community. It was a little bit exotic (I particularly liked the Japanese pinball machine and mangas), without being stereotyped. Two thumbs up in that department.  We arrived around 9pm on a Thursday night, and waited about 10 mins to be seated, which I thought was very reasonable. The service was friendly and attentive.  Foodwise, we two shared - the seaweed salad (springy with a tasty dressing, a little bit tangy but not overpowering) - the yakitori (nice, but not exceptional) - the fried tofu (very light and tasty, with fresh silky tofu) - the sweet potato fries (thick-ish, long fries in a tempura-style light batter, with a delicious spicy mayo) - a large bowl of the ebi-miso ramen (did not find it watery at all, and you could definitely taste the lobster, which I wondered about beforehand as I thought it would be overpowered by the pork or miso)  We washed it down with a pint each of the house beer and the bill came to $57, which was very reasonable.  I wouldn't say it was an amazing experience (such as my recent trip to Kazu), but it was worth the trip to the Plateau, and I'd go back again."}
{"text":"On se promenait sur Mont-Royal et on est rentré dedans, un peu par hasard, un peu parce qu'on avait gouté un beignet provenant de chez eux lors d'une journée de dégustation sur Mt Royal. On n'a pas été déçu ! De supers soupes, bien chaudes, bien réconfortantes ! Et en plus de ça, vue directe sur la cuisine, à regarder le ballet des cuistots. Fait qu'on est resté 1h30 accoudés au bar à discuter, manger et regarder les cuisines :D J'y retourne très bientôt c'est certain !"}
{"text":"A friend took me here. I had the cold ramen salad, which was quite good: the noodles had some chew, the toppings were good (though the ham was more European style than Asian) and the dressing/sauce was good. The chicken karaage was ok, but not amazing and a small portion for $7.   The staff were nice so we opted to add the \"buy a beer for the kitchen for $5\" option. fun!"}
{"text":"A brand new resto-bar that I will return to again and again!  Saka-Ba just opened in the Plateau, and I'm so glad to have found this gem. I went later in the evening on a Friday night and still managed to find a seat, though the restaurant was full. My date and I sat at the back of the restaurant, at a gorgeous red wooden counter, facing a window that overlooks the kitchen, so you can watch the kitchen staff prepare meals in front of you. We were mesmerized as the cooks exhibited obvious flair in what they were doing. Somehow watching your food happen before your eyes gives you a nice connection to it when it arrives at your table.   Our server was really great: very friendly and efficient, yet taking the time to pause to answer our questions. Wait times for food were reasonable and the food was delish! We shared a seaweed salad, chicken skewers and the lobster broth ramen. It was the perfect amount of food for me, though my date had a slightly bigger appetite and wanted more afterwards. The menu is SUPER affordable, so ordering more would be no issue. In fact, I love the price point at this place. Most appetizers are in the $6 range and the ramen bowls around $14.   The décor and vibe of the place are really enjoyable - next time I think I'll sit at the long bar which is a feature of the interior. There are vintage Asian television show posters on the walls, and Astro Boy is a recurring theme in the décor as well. In one corner by the entrance was a vintage pinball game, which I'd hoped to try but I'm not sure it's functional! Ha. Overall the look of the place is ambient, chic and warm. Just my kind of atmosphere.   No alcoholic bevvies on the menu yet, but that was alright with me: gave me an excuse to head on down the street to the nearest cocktail bar once I was full on ramen goodness.  Oh, I should mention that their playlist was great, too."}
{"text":"Saka-Ba has been on my to-try list for a while now. The chef behind this relatively new ramen joint, is also the household name behind hugely acclaimed Jun-I and needs no further introductions. Saying that I was looking forward to my ramen bowl is quite the understatement.  Their menu is short and to the point and I opted for the Ebi-Miso ramen, listed on the menu as a concoction of lobster, miso, and pork stock. I echo a lot of the reviews in that the broth, usually cloudy and heavy feeling, was surprisingly watery. The noodle were yummy, but the sides (pork slices, (half!) egg, and corn) could definitely have been more generous.  I liked it and it fixed my hunger, but unless I was in the neighbourhood, I would not travel to this meal."}
{"text":"The food and ambience here was thoroughly unimpressive. Not to say that it was bad in any way it just did nothing special. The ramen soup could have been simple powdered chicken broth, with no particular flavour standing out other than salty broth with blanched vegetables. Again, nothing was bad but if you are looking to find something special and new, this does not seem to be the place for you.   I would not go back to sample other bits of the menu nor would I recommend this place to a friend.   The friends I was with shared this opinion as well.   Good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Nouveau dans le quartier. Excellent resto. Carte simple, en évolution. Très abordable et ambiance sympa."}
{"text":"lovely kimchi ramen nice and spicy i think people are being too severe rating this place! i myself is a ramen fan and ramen comes from different regions in Japan this is why some places have a specific taste so it is a very personal taste and there isnt the best ramen place they are all different. this place is a bit fusion since kimchi is korean but they excelled at the presentation and taste of it bravo."}
{"text":"Minor culinary confession time: I had never had real ramen before. One of those food blind spots that I figured I would eventually correct given the right context. Truth to known, giving my lack of knowledge regarding ramen, I was never quite sure what to look for in good ramen or where even to find good ramen here in Montreal. Well, Chef Junichi Ikematsu, owner of JUNI on Laurier, solved that part for me with the opening of a Ramen Bar in the Plateau, Saka-Ba!. Taking advantage of some vacation time, I went down on a Sunday night with a couple of friends to finally try out some Ramen.  Located on Mont-Royal east of Christophe Colomb, Saka-Ba! is a sight to behold when you walk in. Modern in look but still very welcoming - nice touches of Japanese culture (art prints, anime strips on the walls) amongst the wood floors, grey walls and bright red tabletops. The focus of the space is the massive red wrap-around bar which really makes an impression. Saka-Ba doesn't take reservations so depending on when you go, you may end up waiting. We were there for 8pm on a Sunday night and still needed to wait 30 minutes so please take that into consideration.  Food-wise, the menu consists of 3 types of Ramen with a variety of Izakaya or Japanese pub dishes available as well. As we were 3 pretty hungry guys on this visit, we attacked the menu with fervour and eat almost everything available. First up, Tako kiuri - an octopus salad with a spicy sauce. Deliciously tender octopus tossed with some cucumber, green onions, sesame seeds and a little sauce - a very nice starting point. The killer here was the octopus - texturally perfect without any of the chewiness one fears with poorly prepared octopus.  Next up, Kimchi daikon. Kimchi, for the un-initiated, is a fermented vegetable dish using a combination of spices which typically create a very strong and spicy flavour. In this case, the vegetable in question was daikon. Served in a tiny preserves jar, Saka-Ba!'s kimchi started off softly but packed a strong punch at the end.  The third dish was the Gyoza - fried pork and cabbage dumplings. Big fan of these through my multiple Izakaya visits so these weren't hard to enjoy on my end. Nice sear on the dumplings and the filling was quite flavourful - there really wasn't much need for the dipping sauce in my opinion.  Next, we had the Kara Age - fried organic chicken with spicy mayo. Probably the best of our starters - great crunch to the chicken while still remaining juicy and tender. The spicy mayo was also on point - even though we ran out of chicken, we finished off the sauce regardless!  To follow the path of fried food, we also had the Corn cari - curry stuffed doughnuts. Probably the most disappointing dish sadly - the fried balls themselves were great however the curry mixture inside lacked much punch. It really didn't add anything to the dish and left all 3 of us wanting.  The final starter (yeah I know.... what can I say, we were hungry) was the Satsuma Age - sweet potato fries. Served with more of that great spicy mayo and lightly tossed with some paprika, these thickly cut fries were delicious and not over breaded either which was appreciated.  And now we reach the main course - the Ramen. Saka-Ba! offers 3 types of broth each with their own extra ingredients to mix with the house made noodles and the boiled egg. First up, the Shoyu Ramen - pork and soy broth, braised pork, bean sprouts, bamboo and green onions. As a first experience with Ramen, this one struck me as a very good one. The broth was rich and flavourful - huge pork notes within the broth. The noodles were awesome - great texture with their own nice taste. The braised pork simply fell apart - so good. The egg added some rich creaminess to the mix and the rest of the ingredients provided some nice notes to the mixture. A great intro to Ramen for yours truly.  The second variety was the Ebi Miso Ramen - Lobster and pork broth, miso, braised pork, corn, bean sprouts, bamboo and green onions. The addition of lobster in the broth and the miso brought forth a slightly less pork flavoured broth with not much of a lobster taste to be honest.   The final variety was the Tori shio Ramen - chicken and salt broth, pain seared upper leg chicken, fried onions, bean sprouts and green onions. This was a very different profile than the other two due to the lack of pork and the use of chicken. The chicken meat itself was nice and tender and the fried onion brought some crunch. The broth here was quite a bit saltier than the previous two.  As an introduction to Ramen, Saka-Ba! hit all the right notes - great decor, nice vibe and awesome food. As someone who hates waiting in-line for any meal (still the biggest reason why I don't return to Kazu), I am not sure I would do so again for Ramen but Saka-Ba! certainly made a great impression on me. As a starting point for Ramen, I definitely feel I got the proper experience to judge future bowls. I'm sure you will as well.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"They apparently changed the recipe for the lobster miso ramen, so it really wasn't that great."}
