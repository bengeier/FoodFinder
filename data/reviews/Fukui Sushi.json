{"text":"This is the sushi joint up by my parents' house, in South Leaside, the whitest neighborhood next to Rosedale in the city. It's mostly pubs, cause white people LOVE pubs. Fukui is the only sushi joint and it's pretty bomb considering. First of all, it's called Fukui which doesn't take a genius to start bastardizing in English. I used to tell my mom it was \"Fukui White People\" and that they were having the last laugh. 

They do take out, but not delivery. The sushi is good enough to safely get a chirashi don without having to drown it in sauce to stomach the crap cuts of fish, but it's not so good that I would eat there as a restaurant. It's also well priced and a godsend when I get the hangover craving for sushi and I'm stuck in pub-land and my folks' house."}
{"text":"On about the 100th visit, I thought I'd yelp. They're good. Very good. Consistently. Fresh, attentive, friendly. And simply really good sushi. Wish the Toro and Shimaaji were available more often, but I'm sure market forces reign. This is a neighborhood Sushi restaurant you wish was in YOUR neighborhood. If you can't find parking on Bayview, use the Green P a block or so south (or park in the RBC lot if you dare and its after hours). Don't even think about going somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"I like this place. The staff was very nice and friendly. The food was super fresh and very tasty. Overall, it was good experience. I would definitely come back there."}
{"text":"Fukui Sushi, located in one of the most expensive neighbourhoods in Toronto, was a disappointment. It is located right next door to another Japanese restaurant - Tokyo Sushi. We decided to have lunch at Fukui instead of Tokyo because the Lunch Special outside was more appealing to me.

The restaurant has a few tables on the street sidewalk (Bayview Ave.) as well as some in the back of the restaurant. Right when we walked in, we could hear who we think is the owner chatting pretty loudly with the Sushi bar itamae in Mandarin Chinese about what sounded like the food stock/supply prices of the restaurant.

The waitress told us to sit wherever we wanted, since there was only one table being served at that time. After browsing the menu in detail, I shockingly realised that the \"daily lunch specials\" weren't priced lower than regular lunch pricing! We went on a Wednesday so the lunch special was Chicken Katsu, but the price marked in the back of the Lunch menu for Chicken Katsu was the same as the one below the special. I made sure to read the menu carefully and both options (daily special and normal order) came with miso soup and nothing extra.

The Unagi Don (BBQ Eel on rice) had a smaller portion than what I expected. The fish was grilled to the point where one side was very slightly crunchy/hard, which isn't what the typical BBQ Unagi tastes like. I always order this item when I visit a Japanese restaurant and I can say that I wouldn't recommend this item for this restaurant. $10.99

The Sashimi Lunch was also smaller of an order than expected. The sashimi came on a plate with the rice in a separate bowl, while usually the sashimi is placed on top of the rice. The sashimi was sliced at an angle as if it was a baguette, which was weird. But other than that, the fishes did taste fresh. $11.99

The Beef Teriyaki was served on cooked bean sprouts with sauce, rice served separately. I would say that this dish was worth the money and the best out of the three. $7.99

{"text":"I was introduced to Fukui Sushi by a friend who is a regular customer. She suggested that we meet for dinner in midtown (closer to where I live) and knew of a decent Japanese restaurant called Fukui. I was surprised (and a bit skeptical) to find such a decently Yelp rated Japanese restaurant in the Davisville area. 

The restaurant itself is easy to miss. Fukui is nestled between the numerous small businesses in Davisville Village and is probably mostly frequented by locals. With seating for about 20 people, it's neither the biggest nor the fanciest restaurant. The interior is clean but drab. It's definitely nothing to write home about.  

Her family usually orders an omakase style dinner, basically leaving it up to the chef to choose food items. They double check for food allergies and restrictions first, so not to worry. Maybe omakase is not for everyone, but I enjoyed the element of surprise and not knowing what was coming out next. If you want more food, you just  ask. The downside is that the bill is going to be more of a surprise. I am pretty sure omakase is available to all customers and not just because my friend is a frequent flyer. 

I cannot remember the all the exact dishes, but my overall impression was that the sashimi was outstanding. The quality of seafood is definitely a step up from your average sushi joint.  The amaebi (sweet shrimp) was particular memorable. They were served with deep fried shrimp heads and this complimented the sashimi nicely. I was a little hesitant at first, but fear not, they are delicious. The fatty tuna and uni were also quite palatable. 

As for appetizers, the Yaki Nasu (grilled eggplant) and beef sashimi were just okay. Actually I would stay away from the beef sashimi completely, since it seemed like they were still thawing out.  The Ika Yaki (grilled squid) was good as was this fish jerky appetizer (I can't find it on the menu).

The service was pleasant and attentive, but then again we were one of the few customers that night. Fukui Sushi does seem to be a Chinese owned restaurant. For what it's worth, I am Chinese too. Admittedly, I am a bit of a food snob and I am biased towards non-Japanese run Japanese restaurants. However, Fukui seems to really focus on high grade produce and their delicious sashimi reflects this. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious! 

The service here is so attentive and the owners are super nice! We went here for an office lunch/birthday lunch and they even offered us free ice cream. 

We started with bento boxes, beef sashimi and some dragon rolls. The green dragon roll is fantastic!! So good! 

I used to frequent California Roll nearby and I'm now a diehard fan of Fukui! 

They do takeout and delivery as well and this service is quick."}
{"text":"my best chirachi don ever ....
the selection of fish, presentation of the dish is way above the average
it's a bit more pricey than the average but it's justified"}
{"text":"Service: 10/10. 
Food Quality: 10/10. 
Ambiance: 9/10. 

Try the 'Toronto roll'. Ownership here seems to take pride in the customer experience and they treat all patrons well - new or repeat customers. Visited 4 times over the year and each experience was positive."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with some colleagues and was not disappointed. I ordered a bento box and it was delicious - maybe because I was really hungry. The funny thing is that there is also another sushi place right next to it. Haven't had the time to tried that one out, but someone let me know!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years with my parents. It's one of the few places that there's no fighting about and we all agree upon. 

Today the 4 of us came with a coupon voucher, $19 for $40 worth of food. It was an excellent deal with no expiry date and we could use two of them. 

Got the Sashimi Boat ($25) with about 20 pieces. Fresh fish, and size was not skimped. It comes with miso soup and salad. 

The Soft Shelled Crab was tasty but tasted a little fishy ($8.99)

Tried the grilled eggplant miso, it was good but wouldn't recommend - something you can make at home. Cooked eggplant with miso paste on it, essentially. 

Got the grilled Mackeral (Saba) for $8.99 and it grilled and chewy a little. 

The best was the Nabasakei Udon ($10.99) with a good clean tasting broth and a half cooked egg floating in the middle. 

The parents also ordered a chicken teriyaki. 

For dessert we opted across the street to the Mad Italian Gelato Bar

The damage was $110 tonight for 4 people, and with the coupon an excellent deal."}
{"text":"Surpisingly good. Grilled mackarel, squid, yakitori and beef sashimi matches well with beer. 5 star is based on the quality of food served."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi restaurants in town! They offer an affordable omakase which offers a variety of fish from Japan that are hard to find. In my opinion, their regular menu is good sushi - doesn't necessarily stand out from other restaurants but their variety of fish is impressive. 

I personally recommend the sushi omakase, and then adding on additional pieces or other dishes. The foie gras sushi is an interesting piece to try! 

The restaurant is small and cozy, but rest assured that the sushi will be worth it."}
{"text":"I came here last minute on a date on my way to couples salsa lessons and was SO glad I walked in. The entire staff greet you when you enter the restaurant, which is a nice touch. We were seated right away. All of the seating in the restaurant is very close to the sushi bar, so everything is being served right as it's been made. 

Looking around, it became clear that almost half of the people in the restaurant were regulars. They seemed to have some nice friendship with the staff, and it made it feel very welcoming. 

My date and I split a sashimi plate and the Toronto roll. Everything was excellent. The fish was exceptionally fresh for the most part, definitely a cut above most other places in the area at a similar price point. If I'm in the area again I will strongly consider this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've tried a few of the sushi places in the area, out of what I've tried for fish quality this is my preferred spot.

If you prefer being able to taste the fish, enjoy sashimi and having a variety of things to try like don you would most likely like this place and should try it. I recommend the chirashi don. They're a little expensive and if you prefer to eat a lot of different rolls it will add up. 

The main reason I enjoy this place is the sashimi variety, and fish they use. I have no complaints accept they could have some more cheaper combo options, other than bento boxes which are not my thing."}
{"text":"Everything that I had including their assorted sashimi was surprisingly VERY fresh and well portioned. 
In terms of location and space - pretty tiny spot nestled in between a few other restaurants on Bayview. 
The Atmosphere is casual and comfortable. 
The only thing that got my attention in terms of service is how easy going they are if you want to alter certain things and substitute certain items on each dish with out additional charge. The also have soy wrap hand rolls which is really good!
Now If you order take out or delivery, somehow the quality decreases and additional charges are made for any changes and the portions are much smaller. 
Since i tried both ways i would recommend dinning there because you get more in terms of quality and portions.

Bring your own lobster and have it prepared in various ways! They prepare & present it very well. Possibly my favorite spot if I want them to cook up a couple of lobsters for me."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant. They have some of the highest quality Japanese in the city. Additionally, the bento box is a deal in a half (super well priced and DELISH)! The place is quite small and only has a couple of tables, make sure you go early to get a table during the weekend. The service is good and they are pretty friendly!"}
{"text":"Very good, high quality sushi! They have a large menu and everything they have is pretty tasty. 
They don't get 5 stars because the waitress there seems to act nice or unpleasant depending on the way you are dressed or how you look... I go there during lunch time with friends from work, dressed properly and she's nice. I go there again on my day off, my hair in a bun, in my gym clothes and get crappy service. Pretty sad!"}
{"text":"A tiny, cozy restaurant for Japanese food. I love the casual yet intimate environment. The food is delicious and filling for reasonable prices. The staff are friendly too. I would definitely come to this place for a date or just to catch up with a friend over some green tea. 

The only downside is being on Yonge street, you'll have to find parking somewhere. Of course, the upside is that once you're done your meal, it's located in an area that's a lot of fun to walk around and explore."}

{"text":"It's a pretty good restaurant. Not in my top 5, but I would still go back and have a bento box or rolls if I were in the area. Our waitress was very attentive and service was superb. The rolls were good, but nothing spectacular. Considering the price range, it's a good value for your money."}
{"text":"I live close by and pick up my sushi here a couple of times a month. Reasonable prices and above average sushi. Especially like the chopped  spicy scallops sushi, Toronto roll and the soft shell crab appetizer. The rest is pretty plain, but serves its purpose when you just want to pick up or get some sushi deliverd fast. The restaurant itself is ok, but absolutely not a great place if you want to go out for a great meal."}
{"text":"It is a good and affordable place for Japanese food. I got a Yuki(?) bento box which tastes good for $22; but probably won't go back there unless I'm in the area.. nothing spectacular about this place."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi. My go to sushi place in my neighbourhood. Always a good crowd which shows their popularity."}
{"text":"Fukui is a total Japanese food experience, not just limited to sushi, but their regular entrees are also delicious.

It's a smaller place than most other sushi places, but the atmosphere is very welcoming.  The staff and chefs are always friendly.

Some items may be a tad more expensive than what you may find out in the GTA, but the quality and presentation is always excellent, so I definitely won't complain. 

I especially enjoy their Bayview, Boston, and Rainbow rolls.  And I also very much enjoy their Donburi, served in a hot bowl, very warming for the soul.

During summer, you can also enjoy your meals on the street patio, or out back. 

For all the times I've been in Fukui, I've seen people of all races and backgrounds enjoy dining here, even children.  That in itself should be a statement to the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the food."}
