{"text":"The service was good here. I had an excellent waitress named April. I come in here often. She always joyful. I just have to say that the Prime Rib Burger was superb. It was juicy tender and tasty. I devoured it. I like how the don't up charge for sweet potato fries, unlike Red Robin. All in all, my experience was great. Good food good service nice ambiance. Thanks Cocos!!"}
{"text":"Fresh biscuits are not fresh (microwaved). Toast is not toasted. Egg benedicts are not poached (also microwaved). Turkey sausage are some sort of greasy patty. If the  super glossy photos on the menu warned you away then good job, you missed a terrible meal. Service is ok however."}
{"text":"I go here quite often and the food is always good and the service is great, our server (David) is awesome very nice and friendly and he always makes fresh coffee for us :)"}
{"text":"I've only been to Coco's for breakfast - but I've been several times, because it's good - a solid breakfast with good food and good service away from the casinos.  I highly recommend this place for breakfast - it's not too expensive, and the food and service are fine.  It's not a fancy breakfast - just a solid breakfast akin to some of the other chain breakfast places.  I particularly like the hash browns."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience.  After long day of travel we chose to eat here because we could walk.  The menu looked great.  My choice medetranian cod.  The grilled veggie was steamed broccoli, the cod was hard seemed like it had been microwaved.  My companion wedge salad  minus bacon and ranch add canned Italian dressing from the bottle.  Steak sandwich no flavor.  Our other party had chicken salad, chicken was processed prepackage.  All plates were gross.  Possibly worst dining experience ever.  In addition the place dirty."}
{"text":"If ur try to eat a good meal cocos is not where u should go there are hard working employees but the management is another story not to Be seen unfair and disrespectful I will spend my money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Waitress was too busy. Finally after my cup was empty for 10 mins she noticed and asked me if I need refill. Food was good. Like the style of the restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Coco's is still one of the best places  in the Valley to go for good American food prepared as it always has been.  You will be glad to know that this one on 7hth Street is still open!  Some others have closed.  I've been there for dinner twice lately and had the salmon and a New York Strip Steak  The salad greens are so crispy (getting to be a rare thing most places) and they serve great baked potatoes and veggies.   Really good..  Server Adam is attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"I can not understand how anyone with good taste could rate this place with 5 stars! The food is bland, and the place is messy. The only good thing about this eating establishment  is the view of the golf course and it's a good place to get a drink after a round of golf."}
{"text":"Great gluten free selection.... best gluten free pancakes Angie and Sam have ever had!  Wonderful service too!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see negative reviews! My husband, daughter & I come every Sunday for a family breakfast.  The staff is super friendly,  the restaurant is clean and the food is delicious.   We generally order a variation of the same each week - eggs, ham or sausage, potatoes and pancakes or french toast. We always leave completely stuffed (I usually take some home) and looking forward to our next trip.   The manager comes over every time we come to give my daughter a balloon, which makes her day.  We love this Coco's and will continue to patron this location."}
{"text":"Very very gross food. I would never come here again. I would give it zero stars if possible. Not good quality ingredients service isn't great either."}
{"text":"After last day in las vegas my wife and i stop to grab some breakfast.  There was no long line to wait and we were seated quickly.  The services was good no complaint and the food was hot and an abundance of what we both ordered.  Overall inexpensive meal for 2 and tasted great."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner. We are new to the area and thought we would give Coco's a try.  NEVER AGAIN. !   The service was the worst we have ever experienced.  We sat and waited for someone to take our order.  We sat and waited for our meal to be served.  Then we sat and  waited for refills on our drinks ( which we needed to wash down the heavily over peppered country fried steak dinners ).   We had wanted to order pie for desert but after waiting so long for our server to show up after our meal we were not inclined to spend anymore time there.  When she finally did show up she slammed the receipt on the table without even asking if we might like to order desert.  When we went up front to pay, we asked about what kind of pies they had.  The hostess seemed put off by our question and rudely answered \" oh we have some in the back but I don't know what kind they are \".   Gee, thanks for nothing,Sweetheart, sorry to bother you.  We won't be back !"}
{"text":"I know one star seems harsh when you've got a location like this...here on the 18th green, a beautiful location in Grand...and then the food and service is so bad it;s  a real big disappointment. Because of the setting, this could be a goldmine. The decor is dated but it's okay. Our last visit was 1.5 years ago and we said we'd never go back after talking with others who also agreed it was always terrible. But,  in a weak moment we decided to give it a try again. Just as bad as the first time. I had to pick out the soggy, nasty lettuce out of my salad. When questioned as to how I enjoyed my meal, I explained that the salad was not fresh. They said they were sorry and we said Goodbye..."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we found this little spot. Close to the action, but just enough off the beaten path to give us a welcome break from all things Vegas.   Huge menu, kids eat free Sunday through Thursday, and a quiet alternative to the huge casinos. Went back a second time during our Vegas trip. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner items were available when we went both nights.   Service was quick, which with hungry kids was VERY important. Prices were very reasonable. Much better than inside the casino, so make a short drive or walk from the MGM or Tropicana over here. It will be a welcome break for your ears, your feet and your wallet."}
{"text":"Dirty tables and booth seats. Not well maintained.  Service is mediocre.  Food average"}
{"text":"Cinnamon roll french toast is fantastic!! Rather large and the boyfriend had the lumberjack special and that was a huge plate as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Place has a smell to it that is not pleasant. Food was delivered fast, however the eggs were tasteless. Service was good."}
{"text":"Simple diner. Quick service fast service average food. One standout item was banana nut muffin. I imagine most of their baked items are pretty good. Eggs, bacon and hash were standard fare."}
{"text":"I have gone here quite a few times. I like having a diner close by for breakfast and newspaper reading. But this one is always short staffed. And there doesn't seem to be much management around to smooth things out. Food is usually good but staff always seems stressed out. May be due to serving hoards of poor tipping elderly."}
{"text":"Ottimo locale dove abbiamo fatto colazione tre mattine. Essendo fuori dalla strip si riesce ad avere un rapporto qualità/prezzo molto buono. Unico neo la strada che dalla strip porta al locale non è propriamente popolata da lord inglesi..."}
{"text":"I got breakfast at about 5am the waiter was polite and took our order promptly. While waiting for our food I glanced over to the kitchen and saw 2 employees searching for insects with flashlights and spraying the kitchen and surrounding areas with an industrial bug sprayer. Did I mention they were still making our food at the same station they were spraying? If that wasn't enough to leave, they decided to spay the surrounding booths with said bug spray to the point in which my wife had to ask them to wait until we were finished with our food, that didn't take long because my wife and I were too disgusted to eat. It's safe to say I wont be back"}
{"text":"Took the wife here after hearing about it from a friend.  Sat outside and enjoyed a great view on a nice morning.  I had the Eggs Benedict and thought it was done perfectly with great ingredients.  Better than some i've had at 5 star resort (IMO).  My wife was pleased with her omelette.  All the food was worth 5 stars and I didn't have any complaints about the service but I had dirty silverware.  Otherwise I would give 5 stars"}
{"text":"Not super impressed with Cocos.  The fruit was not ripe and the calorie content on the menu was sky high!  The lighter menu was still high but it was good. However, our biggest problem was the service. Our server, Robert, was not friendly at all and we went without drinks for a few minutes while he took other tables orders."}
{"text":"Love this place. Right next to motel 6. Food, price and services were good. Will come again for next trip."}
{"text":"After living in AZ for over three years I just ate (or tried to eat) the worst restaurant meal ever. At this Cocos restaurant.  Lousy food, lousy service!  It was Valentines Day and both my wife and I (and our friends)  had the Steak and Lobster Valentines Day special as recommended to us by the waitress (who by the way was the hostess who greeted and seated us, explaining that the normal waiter for our table was too busy). When finally served (long wait) the fully loaded baked potatoes my wife and I ordered appeared to have been under a heat lamp for way too long. The cheese topping was not cheesy in texture, just dried out and almost hard. My wife's lobster tail although small seemed quite normal. As for mine when I pulled at the protruding meat expecting to get more from inside the tail it just fell off. There was no more meat in the tail beneath the scales/fins. The portion would fit in a tablespoon, Really!. It was about half of the size of the tail meat that my wife and our other two friends were served.  After over more than a minimum of five minutes of trying to get our waitresses or any wait helps attention and finding my tasteless steak getting cold I decided to start to eat the lobster before it met the same demise.  As I proceeded cutting my steak I found it to be overall very tough and without flavor. The only redeeming value food served were the vegetables and the bread. My wife and our lady friend only ate about a quarter of their steaks, my male friend a bit over half, and about a quarter for me with another quarter of the \"attempted to cut -  but inedible portions\" adorning my plate. With the exception of one coffee refill for my wife there was no offer for refills of our water glasses, my ice tea, or our friends soft drinks. The hostess/waitress just kept flying by with packaged orders from the kitchen for take out folks without a glance in our direction.       The next verbal communication with our waitress was when she approached offering / pitching pie and other desert items. When we declined she immediately gave us prepared checks and ask if we wanted boxes. Our female friend requested two for them, my wife one. When she ask me (I had noticed that she had looked at the uneaten mess on my plate which was directly below her gaze) I declined saying no thanks, and pointed with my fork to the steak on my plate and in a quiet manner stated to her that I was sorry but that I had found my steak to be extremely tough and not worth taking home. She just quickly said that she was sorry. I was going to tell her about my lobster tail issue but she did not give me a chance as she immediately walked away as I began to speak ignoring my verbalization attempt.  I thought that because of my complaint that she might have informed the manager or someone that might address my complaint. But no, she just delivered the ask for boxes at the corner of the table farthest from my position, not looking my direction whatsoever and again walked away. Disgusted, I gave up. Paid our bill and left."}
{"text":"We ended up here after a late-night show looking for gluten-free pancakes. This was the only place we could find that offered them late night. They were so good - we weren't sure if they were actually gluten-free:) The place is a bit of a dive - but the food and service were great. In particular, Crystal was a fantastic server! She was so genuine and friendly. We observed her with everyone that came in and she treated everyone with great service. It was so refreshing to see a truly friendly server!"}
{"text":"Food was awful looks and tasted like a TV dinner eggs looked like they were dipped in grease not impressed won't return"}
{"text":"Surprisingly the food was not too bad. However the service was quite slow.  This is always a great place to pop into if you need a quick pie for a  gathering"}
{"text":"It was good to have dinner in Las Vegas. This restaurant seems a traditional american style I have ever seen on TV or drama in out of the country. The server was really kind. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this location recently, in hopes of finding a good, go to breakfast place. On arrival we weren't warmly greeted, simply escorted to our seats. Our waitress came by and took our orders, seemingly rushed. We received our food and it tasted better than expected. We were even debating about maybe making this a quick choice for weekend breakfasts, disregarding the lackluster service. Midway through my sandwich I noticed that I was developing indigestion which is pretty out of the ordinary and with my next bite I discovered a long hair, pulling it out of my mouth in two pieces, I set it aside to show the waitress. She came by, I quietly let her know about my discovery and without saying a word she took the evidence away and went into the kitchen. She returned and asked if I wanted another meal, I declined and then she gave us an adjusted check with my meal removed from the bill. I know that hair can get into food from time to time, but pulling a hair out of your mouth that couldn't be yours is very disgusting. We paid or bill and went home, me with very intense stomach pains, which I got to deal with the tasty of the morning. Needless to say, we won't be returning. Yuck!"}
{"text":"We loved cocos its like your fav hometown dinner . Treated us like they new us made us feel right at home and we never been there before. food wasgood  chocolate cream pie was awesome. Prices were great. Would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food is good, Service too! Especially in April's Section! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Only .5 mile walk away from the strip...this diner has friendly service and really good food , at an good price for Las Vegas . I came for breakfast and plan to return tomorrow for dinner ."}
{"text":"Thank you other Yelpers!  We had an excellent first meal as breakfast at Coco's Family Resturant. Great food and great service. We are planning on visiting here again before we head home. Nice casual place that is focused on excellent food and fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Only eat breakfast here! Since this is next to my hotel we have eaten there 3 times in 2 days. The breakfast menu is pretty large and the food is decent/average. The fruit substituted for a meat choice was 4 small chunks of melon on a separate large plate.  I liked the cinnamon roll French toast a lot, but wanted 2 pieces, which she said was not an option. She could bring me 2 but it would be the same price. There was nothing a la carte listed on the menu, though my mom ordered just eggs and English muffin. I'm not sure what she paid, but they served it on 2 plates. The pancakes and waffles were good, as were the omelets, and I asked for poached medium expecting I'd get poached easy but at least the whites would be totally cooked, and that's what I got. The dinner included mediocre garden salad with some brown leaves, the \"grilled cod\" was chewy and the veggies were fresh but cooked weird - very salty and smoky and sparse cauliflower heads and broccoli spears. All on a plate 2x too big. The pies are ok but not better than grocery store. The staff is the worst part - super fast and obviously not interested. All 3 times whatever the 1st person said they wanted to drink, they repeated back: \"so 4 coffees?\" or \"waters?\" It was disconcerting and kind of stressful. Finally looked on yelp and I see there's a Denny's right around the corner. Hopefully my co-diners will be up for the walk - I can't eat at Coco's again!"}
{"text":"The gluten free pancakes were good. The sunny side eggs were under cooked and tasteless We waited a long time to get our food after ordering. I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The poached eggs for my prime rib hash and eggs were basically hard boiled. Should've gone to the Denny's instead"}
{"text":"I'm super allergic to gluten and I have eaten here several times late night with John as waiter & they are ALWAYS so careful with my food! Came in early tonight with Donna as waitress and Carlos as manager and they both had talks with kitchen staff about my allergies and I had a great late NY steak Med-rare (perfectly cooked, unlike some OTHER places), with mash and broccoli.   Super safe for celiacs and a HUGE gluten free menu! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This restuarant has some very good food for a typical chain restuarant. The steaks are always delicous, and you can tell they are cooked over actual flame. Service is good. Evenings are slower since it is in Sun City."}
{"text":"sweet place. The Omlete is well cooked and great service. My mate took a dump in there"}
{"text":"The food came out Luke warm. He ordered meat lovers omelet and I ordered the San Diego meal. The potato pancakes were not even cooked. It tasted like mush with raw batter inside. Not to mention it was 32 min before our food came out. The manager nicely heard our concerns and said \"ok\" and walked away. Wtf? They took off the items from our bill but man! Sucky experience."}
{"text":"My first visit. I've driven by many times but never stopped in. I've been to Village Inn many times but it is located farther from my home. The food here is great, the prices very reasonable, and the coffee cake \"to die for\". Service was friendly, prompt and as we desired to sit and chat a while refills were provided in a very timely manner."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant while visiting family in Surprise. We were seated quickly, but service beyond that was not good. The server entered the incorrect order, and rarely checked our table.   The food was also below par. It was greasy and just thrown on the plate. Most of the orders were served cold, and it took 10 minutes to fix rhe incorrect orders.  To top it off, we ordered 5 pies two days ahead of time. When we checked out, they did not have our order. They lost it. I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Visited between lunch and dinner:  Fast and friendly service.  Far better menu than IHOP or Denny's.  Meal combos \"Trio\" (limited time only?) are fantastic because you get a slice of your choice of pie.  Unbeatable bargain because the food is fresh, very tasty, in what I consider nice sized portions and the pie was included...otherwise a slice of pie cost around $4 by itself!  Saved room for the pie and took my left over meal to go.  Will definitely visit this or any Coco's location again."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Coco's for a while (Cactus Road near PV Mall).  Don't know that I'll venture in again for quite some time. I understand that breakfast is good...the parking lot is always full on week-day mornings. However, this is one \"tired old girl\", if you know what I mean.  She's in need of a major \"makeover\".  The carpet has seen better days = and a dirty carpet  in a restaurant always makes me cringe.  I was there for a late lunch (2:30). I received my iced tea quickly and my menu, then I was abandoned by the lone waitress for about 15 minutes. She was not providing service to other customers.  Where was she?? The food was good and the salad fresh and crisp, so can't complain about that.  I'm 76 years old and I think I was the youngest person in the place!  Seems they may be getting some of the \"old timers\" from the shuttered Marie Callander's across the street.  Before I left after 3:30, the \"early birds\" were beginning to arrive.  I finally got the waitress to notice that I had finished my meal and was ready for a check...and beat a hasty retreat, lesti I be put on the bus and taken back to the \"home\"!! May try it for breakfast on a Saturday and Sunday if I can convince my grandsons (13 and 7) to eat there...and I'll wear my running shoes - just in case.  Come on, people, fix up the place - okay??"}
{"text":"The wife and I have been coming here for breakfast every time we visit Vegas. It's worth the walk from the strip. Most hotels charge $17 for a basic cheese omlette. You can get an awesome specialty omlette with toast and hash browns for $10. Not bad for vegas! Food quality is always superb."}
{"text":"First visit since the fall  noted was open and asked to sit their. It was cleared immediately and we were seated. Waitress was prompt and took orders and delivered drinks. Had grilled salmon ordered undercooked to ensure it was not dry. Arrived as ordered and was very good. Would have preferred something other than broccoli but it was cooked properly and is good for me.  Finished with Dutch Apple pie. Very good.  Nice evening for this location"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, fast service, came over very often with coffee refill, great prices, lovely pancakes.  In all typical diner with your egg and bacon and stuff- only great prices for LV and really tasty.   Big portions. We ordered a small stack of 3 pancakes on the side of our omeletts- big and fluffy, for only 3 bucks additional to the rest of the bill.   absolutely recommended for a nice dinerstyle breckie in Vegas."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak with veggies and a baked potato for dinner. Not bad! I love bread and it came with the dark bread and white bread all for about 14 bucks! yum"}
{"text":"This is a great family restaurant. Service is amazing and they always treat you like family. The food is great and the ambience is very welcoming.  We have been going to this location for several years. Breakfast is also great.. they have a wide variety of options. All the bakery products are excellent specially the pies."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed what we thought was one of the better cheeseburger plates in the valley... at a DIFFERENT Coco's than this one.  Five stars at the Coco's on Bell Rd in Peoria.  Zero stars at the Coco's in Sun City Grand.  Service was terrible (very slow and they gave us both the wrong side dish. ) We pointed it out and they said, \"Oops...Sorry about that.\"  AND WALKED OFF.   The cheeseburger was so overcooked that the cheese was crunchy and black.  Slimy lettuce. Empty water and soda glasses stayed that way.  We joked that the entire staff had gone on break at the same time.  It wasn't busy at all. Word must be getting around.  We vowed to NEVER return.  Terrible food.  Worse service.  Why would we do that to ourselves again?"}
{"text":"This is more like a Dees,or Denny's. The food had no flavor. We waited in line just to pay for more then 10 minutes  Not recommended"}
{"text":"While in Vegas we found this diner for breakfast. It was so good the first time we decided to go back the next day on our way out. Unfortunately I have to give it 3 stars instead of 4. The second day the service was super slow. The 2 tables beside us whose parties were bigger and came in later got there food 20mins before us! When our food got there it was cold. I would only go back if Yaeko is working. She was our server the first day and she rocked it!"}
{"text":"Really wonderful service from Coco's tonight! We had an inkling for pie and dropped by ten minutes before close, sorry to scare you guys, but thank you Adam for quickly bringing us some to go! :)"}
{"text":"For what you're looking for - an affordable breakfast after realizing your already expensive hotel doesn't offer a complimentary one *ahem* - this place is great. Speedy, speedy service! Drinks in under a minute and food in less than 5, great options for those of you trying to eat healthy (and they don't taste like cardboard). In and out in under 25."}
{"text":"Not bad. I had a good classic breakfast, but was a little put off that you can't order \"sides\" of something. They call it \"a la carte\" but it ends up being almost as expensive as getting the entire meal! For instance, I got eggs, bacon, toast. I wanted to try some latkes, but did not want to order an entire latkes meal which came with toast and eggs. I asked for just a side of latkes...we don't do a side, it is a la carte. Ok fine. $7.99!!!! The latkes MEAL was $8.99! Had a really poor server. I think this was his first job. Got a slice of pumpkin pie to go...pretty good. Nothing that I can't get at Costco."}
{"text":"Glad to see the Gluten Free menu and all the choices.   I had the GF banana walnut caramel pancakes and they were delicious. The staff is very friendly and Jarrod made sure I always had a full cup of coffee. I really  this Coco's!"}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast spot. My husband and I always eat breakfast here when we're in Vegas and it never disappoints. Delicious food, courteous and attentive staff and reasonable prices will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Nice and quiet small place. I ordered the steak which was cooked perfectly! The drive out there is beautiful :)  They have a patio for cooler seasons :)"}
{"text":"I dined here a few times recently, and all of the staff who assisted me with 1 thing or another were very helpful and friendly. Food was delivered to my table promptly, and the restaurant was clean and well-kept. Extra kudos to Darryl who shone brighter than the rest!"}
{"text":"We had only had breakfast here and decided to try for dinner upon recommendation of friends who liked the prime rib which is only available on the weekend. This falls into the category of \" you get what you pay for\". The 8 oz prime rib was actually rare as ordered, but was too salty and had at least two ounces of fat. Potato was perfectly cooked and did not have salt on the jacket as is the current trend. Disappointing was the pies for dessert, especially since this place is featured as a bakery/restaurant. Pies came in a soup dish with spoons and were delivered to the table before the dinner dishes were cleared. Chocolate cream pie tasted like pudding with a \" cream\" topping. Dutch apple pie was very sweet."}
{"text":"Just ok, went there for breakfast the other morning and considering the price isn't bad."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat near the Excalibur hotel and came across this hidden gem.  The service was excellent, the food was delicious, and the staff was friendly.  Coco's is my choice over other chain restaurants.  They also have a nice selection of fresh made pies. The prices are very reasonable and the food portions are generous. If you want a great place to eat then go to Coco's. Easy parking available right in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Good pies and simple but good food. While I rarely go to chain places this is where we came to get classic pie that is not on a diet."}
{"text":"After giving up on Coco's 2 years ago due to bad service and bad food, I decided today I needed something strawberry.  I read the reviews in Yelp and they seemed positive for 2013, so I decided to give it a try.  I am not sorry!  The manager Earl and the waiter Robert were as attentive and aware of me as it gets.  They both made me feel welcome and I was seated and waited on as soon as I walked in the door.  I ordered right away and my food was ready in minutes.  The food was great, the service was great, and the whole experience was the best I have had in a long time.  Welcome back Coco's and kudos to Earl and Robert!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised by all the high ratings here.  After a long and late flight, and getting settled at the Tropicana, I was looking for a quick late night bite.  I swung past the South Beach Deli where the pizza looked old, dry, and inedible (and at a high price).  So I walked down to Coco's.  First off the place smells like ass.  There was a young girl, possibly an employee, sleeping on a bench next to the cashier.  I order regular breakfast fare (eggs, bacon, waffle).  Food came in about 2 minutes.  It was nothing special, the waffle was puffy and bland.  The washroom was a hell hole, I tried not to touch anything.  Stuff was not cheap either, with orange juice and tip it totaled $16.  Next time I'll just stick with McDonald's.  Gone are the days when you can find superb cheap latenight breakfast deals in Vegas."}
{"text":"This location is in Sun City Grand.  The locals must like it because it was very crowded.  Not much to say here: very, very noisy dining area. Service was friendly, if hectic.  Food is at best OK. Sandwiches look great but a BLT, as an example, has two large thick pieces of buttered toast and two meager slices of bacon. You're paying for toast! Fries were good but really relied on being over salted for taste. The whole experience was disappointing even if expectations going in were not high."}
{"text":"I have eaten here plenty times before, but never had to return food.  Tonight my steak was unsatisfactory and i spoke up. I received another one quick, fast and good!  I do enjoy this restaurant!"}
{"text":"On 2 recent occasions the experience was extremely slow service. Waiting long periods of time for food and when I asked the guy who seats you to check on it he never returned to answer. He has no professionalism and projects the image of being very unhappy in his job. The food is good but after two back to back bad experiences I am through with this location.  Might add that Grand Ave location is not much better."}
{"text":"Love the pies!!! My family loves all Coco's pies. Our favorite, chocolate silk and lemon meringue.  Never dined in. But the counter staff are always friendly and helpful. A must try pie place. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"From Linda M.   Those people that like this Cocos remember this can happen to you. We will never eat here again.  1-asked for dressing on the side,salad was saturated-2 hamburger burned  3. wanted onion rings shown on the hamburger and they were served on the side and I was charged $4 for them  5-- the peaches on the peach pie were the hard kind you get at the super market and had to cut it with a knife."}
{"text":"I stopped by around 4 AM. There were four other people in the restaurant. I ordered the classic breakfast with scrambled eggs and cheese, potatoes, bacon, a sausage patty and two buttermilk pancakes. About twenty minutes later I got scrambled eggs (no cheese), four sausage links, wheat toast and potatoes. I don't know who messed up but I really don't believe there was any reason for it. My order was eventually corrected and the food was ok. I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I went here with my father for Sunday breakfast.  While the food was great, the customer service really brought this visit down.  Our waitress never said hi, didn't smile and simply asked what do you want to drink in a very disgusted voice like she did not want to be there.  During the waiting time, both the manager and another waitress passed our table and asked the table next to us if he wanted coffee.  It wasn't until almost the end of the meal, another waitress finally asked us if we wanted more coffee.  We were never asked if our food was okay or if we needed anything .  (Not that we were expecting it but still)  My father is a veteran and asked if they had a military discount.  (At first they did not know) but after getting only a 50 cent discount off a 25 dollar bill and the combination of bad service, I'm afraid we will be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Me and my buddy wanted to get some pie for a snack, and we visited this place. Now I'm not a pie connoisseur or anything, but the pie was disappointing, the service was okay, and the feel of the restaurant was okay, nothing stands out about this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. The service was great, and it's nice to pay a reasonable price for breakfast in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We came here because I had been to a few Coco's locations in California before and knew it was good. When we walked in the very first thing I noticed was how absolutely run down and dirty it is - then the worst part hit me. It REEKS of urine in there, everywhere. I thought maybe I just got a whiff of something, but the rest of my group smelled it too and it did not go away. In fact, it was probably the worst when we sat down at our booth in the back. We were all literally gagging and couldn't even consider buying food from here. We got up and left not even 30 seconds after we sat down, it was that bad. I thought maybe this was just a bad day for their sewage system or something, but there are other reviews from months ago that say it smells terrible in there. Also, there were a few giant holes in the ceiling that were covered by black trash bags. What?! The health department REALLY needs to come inspect this place because it is definitely not sanitary or safe in there. You will literally lose your appetite for the rest of the day if you so much as walk in there."}
{"text":"My husband and I came into the restaurant this morning for breakfast. The food was good and the restuarant its self was lovely. What stood out most of all was the manager. Although the restaurant was full and there were a lot of large parties,  she (I think her name was Tree???) seemed to be catering to everyone. Remained attentive, pleasant and everyone seemed to love her. She was such a delight, with her big smile as she poured coffee, cleared dishes and greeted everyone.  As a business owner it is a delight to see someone who is engaging and that genuinely loves there job! We will defiantly return on our next trip."}
{"text":"This is a great little dinner with exceptionally fair prices for the Vegas area. So work walking over from the casino and there crazy high pricing."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. I had the 2eggs, 2 sausage link, 2 pancake and hash browns. It was delicious.  My daughter had the chicken fried steak breakfast-& that was great as well.  The hash browns are the best we've ever had!!  Service was fine. When we got there, on a Sunday morning, there was quite a few people waiting to be seated, but our wait time was less than 5minutes.."}
{"text":"Just too many other breakfast options in this area to pick Coco's - too expensive - fair service - bacon is the worst I've ever had. Unless you live in Sun City Grand & enjoy walking to breakfast, I would find somewhere else."}
{"text":"Disgusting dirty place! Those who have said the food or service is good must be fake Yelpers, drunk or at another CoCo's. Stale pancakes...burnt hash browns, but my omelet was ok. Took about 45 minutes for the food to come out and it was semi warm. I don't know what's worse...the food...the prostitutes...or the drug dealers in the parking lot. Don't make our mistake...pay the extra money to eat somewhere clean and safe. Oh...only gave one star because I had to..."}
{"text":"I wanted to keep this for my little secret but you will not believe how good this is. Service fantastic, well worth the walk. Great prices. I felt like I was eating a good southern breakfast. We'll be back."}
{"text":"so so so goood!!! I liked everything: atmosphere very relaxed, cozy, excellent service, great food.  I ordered chicken with Parmesan and mashed potato. Just simply fantastic. Banana pie was ok (but just because I don't like this kind of pies, like pudding inside), but I think many will find it very good thought. Thank you Coco's for such an amazing experience... It was very nice to run away from crazy Vegas to cozy place"}
{"text":"This is where I would eat on Saturdays when I working.  The service was satisfactory at best and food was always good."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good breakfast place. The staff looked a little sketchy at first, but they ended up being the nicest, most helpful staff we experienced in 4 days. Its a little beat up inside the physical restaurant and feels like a little diner, but was very homey once we settled in. (We love diners but weren't expecting this to be like one)The servings for breakfast were really well sized and the prices were really good considering this place is only 1-2 blocks off the strip. Four of us cost $55. I had eggs, sausage, hash browns and two pancakes. All tasted great and came out on time. The pancakes were delicious. Had the place been in a little better shape I would have considered 5 stars. Food and service were great. Go here for breakfast."}
{"text":"After reading so many bad reviews, my husband and I were pleasantly surprised by the excellent meals we just had!  I ordered a trio:  turkey croissant, cup of soup, and French fries.  My husband had the parmesan crusted chicken with creamy mashed potatoes and an arugula herb salad.  Everything was excellent!  I chose the chicken tortilla soup.  Great flavor - really good!  The turkey served on the croissant was real - not lunchmeat.  The fries were very crispy and very tasty.  The service was also excellent!  If Coco's is reading these Yelp reviews, kudos to them for doing something about it.  Give it a try - we highly recommend!  Oh...and for an added treat, the windows were super clean displaying a gorgeous view of the golf course!"}
{"text":"This place needs health inspector to check this place out. Very dirty and old place. Nothing is updated and bathroom is really gross.   I got dirty glass of water with things floating around in the glass.   Didn't stay there - went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just brought a delicious raspberry swirl cheesecake with chocolate crust from Coco's to a party last night and it was a hit! The balance of the tart and sweet and crunchy crust topped with fresh raspberries was to die for. It's a perfect place to pick up a dessert on the way to a get together. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"A great change from the pricey resort restaurants, good food, great prices and if your there in the evening hopefully you get Donna as your waitress very attentive, fun attitude and nice as can be."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Waitresses are always so nice & friendly plus they know what their doing & how to give great customer service. Me & my family live close by so we go here a lot & always had great consistency with the food & service. It's not much on atmosphere, clean, but nothing special. Location, food & service are what keep us coming back for more. Prices as reasonable too & the fresh baked pies are delicious... Especially my fav the Chocolate Cream Pie.. Yum"}
{"text":"Oh how I look forward to my breakfast here on my Vegas visits! I usually get pancakes, bacon and hash browns and devour every bite! Sure I could take off a star for location but why should I? the hotels are beautiful with lousy food and its 2-3x the price! If you want a great full portion breakfast come here! The staff is courteous and attentive and you will be left satisfied!"}
{"text":"Great hangover breakfast. I had the lumberjack breakfast and it was a huge portion. Not far off the strip and beakfast for two only cost 25 bucks. Spare change compared to a long night of gambling."}
{"text":"A true blessing to find close to the Tropicana.  Worth the walk.  Breakfast was fantastic and CHEAP!!!  Probably the best deal we had the entire time we were in Vegas.  Loved the pancakes and the eggs were SO FLUFFY!"}
{"text":"This place was clean. The service was great Ana was the waitress she kept the coffee full. The food was delivered fast, eggs cooked perfectly not over cooked. The best part is all this food for under 20$ just off the Strip"}
{"text":"3.5/5: Awesome food and service for a great price  We couldn't help ourselves, and pulled in for some pies and breakfast, while we waited to pick up some folks at the airport!  1) Banana cream pie FTW! Ah, so good :) 4/5 2) Fit and Lively Tomato Basil Omelette 4/5: Pretty good considering it is healthy--had to balance a healthy meal with an awesome slice of pie!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast excellent value for money and good service.  Only slow thing was getting coffee refills ! Thanks to Gladys for serving us"}
{"text":"Very inexpensive breakfast option in Vegas near the strip. I actually stayed next door at the Hooters. I came here for a quick and filling breakfast. Usually got a veggie omelet with home fries and Pancakes (instead of toast option which is awesome) , Portions were good and service was good. Food came out pretty timely. And I can honestly say the food was good. The breakfast hit the spot after  a late night out drinking and gambling. once again this is a good cheap breakfast in Vegas. Never seemed to crowded so getting a seat and service was speedy.."}
{"text":"Love this place. At breakfast here twice. Consider yourself lucky if you have Yaeko as your waitress. She is attentive and polite like none other. All the food comes out perfect and is priced right. Great spot. Hard working staff."}
{"text":"Yuck, ick, DO NOT eat here! My husband and I had over cooked hockey-puck-like hamburgers which were served on equally hard, barely edible buns. I had mine with a side salad which was made with old brownish-blackish lettuce. Seriously, eat anywhere else but here!"}
{"text":"I have only gone twice, both times to get things from the \"bakery\", so I am not rating the actual restaurant. The bran muffins are excellent as is the strawberry pie. The young lady at the front desk was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"We like Cocos restaurants in general but I've never been to this one until I checked Yelp.  I was very surprised by the ambience and the fact that it overlooks the golf course and several waterfalls.  My wife loves eggs Benedict and they had several  ways to prepare it.  She had a customized version of eggs Benedict and I had the peach triple breakfast with pancakes.  The wait staff was attentive and friendly and the food can out quickly and was delicious.  I plan on coming back here again."}
{"text":"The breakfast food is great,  the hostess is incredibly unfriendly and rude, the 3 old (not age, longevity)timer waitresses are awesome, the interior and exterior of building needs some major improvements, flower bed trim breaking/ falling down,  dumpsters lids broken/ falling apart,  parking lot badly neglected,  interior has multiple ceiling tiles falling out,  ceiling electrical outlets falling out,  dirty everything,  furniture and building looks like original.... badly warn and dirty, bathrooms are filthy/old, front door has broken or unrepaired hydraulic door hinge that no one tightened or replaced and they seem to think it's okay for the customers to listen to the door slamming every 2 minutes while dining is okay (been going on for several months), please don't get, one of the few left Cocos shut down, because of cleanliness and being so run down.... fix it!"}
{"text":"Today we had the banana  walnut and caramel pancakes with eggs and bacon and  coffee this was a good dish. Also had a very friendly hostess. Her name was Carmina M. We will return again."}
{"text":"I usually drink more than one glass of orange juice and this restaurant doesn't charge for the refill which is great.  Great price as well.  Will come back here when i want to have a traditional american breakfast"}
{"text":"This place is a cute, homey 24/7 diner, across from MGM Grand, attached to a small hotel. Just watch out for tacky Mexican-style paper decorations hanging from the ceiling, and very blustery A/C even on chillier spring days. There is a lighter-option section on the menu, and the back of the menu includes a \"55 plus\" section with affordable healthy options for the 55+. However you don't need to be 55+ to order from that section (I sure am under 55 and got something from there!). But really, all the prices at Coco are very affordable with just about nothing over $20. We ordered: -tuna salad. Very generous portion, more than worth it for the price. The tuna wasn't too creamy and rich so it's a good healthy option. -chopped steak with cheesy bread. The steak was not the best steak ever, but for the price, it was a very good value. I wasn't too thrilled with the cheesy bread, perhaps next time I'll order steak only.  I will warn you that service is a bit slow considering how simple the dishes are. However the staff are friendly and easy to find if you need something. They also have an impressive pie collection that we didn't try yet. Anyway at any rate, Coco Bakery is a great place to recharge your tummy before a fun-filled day out in Vegas."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot the service is always great and the good is delisious and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"I was there for breakfast last Wednesday. The food was cooked exactly as I ordered it - Mediterranean omelette without olives, well done hash browns and side of pancakes. It was very good. The server (Tameka I think was her name) was very attentive. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the interior decor - it is in desperate need of a makeover.  It also doesn't come off as the cleanest place - but my table and all plates, silverware and glasses were clean."}
{"text":"We recently moved back into Downtown - which much to my delight has grown into a real city at long last!   Coco's on 7th St has become our \"go to\" place for a quick bite when we don't feel like cooking or driving more than a few blocks. The staff are invariably polite, friendly, welcoming and just (dare one say it?) plain NICE people. The food is good. Exactly what you'd hoped for but usually do not find. The service is fast and accurate even when the place is packed. We moved into a large condo building near by, and we have met many of our neighbors at Coco's. Seems the whole building dines there at one time or another.    The other evening our A/C in the building failed and was out for about 6 hours on a 100+ degree afternoon and evening. We went over to Coco's for an ice tea, and we mentioned to them what had happened with the failing AC. Along with the Iced Tea, they gave us some of their wonderful Cocoanut Creme Pie 'on the house' in a thoughtful and kind attempt to cheer us up after living with no AC for several hours.  This little kindness mean so much to us and certainly it was not expected... but that bit of reaching out to cheer us up did in fact make the whole world look brighter for a while! We survived the heat, loved their iced tea and when we got back home the AC was running again at last!   If you're in the area, stop in. The food is good, the service above your expectations and the people are incredible.  Much more than we would have ever expected from a small chain-type restaurant.  Be sure to try the Cocoanut Creme Pie, too. It's become our favorite, even when we pay for it !!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast food with generous portions.  Much better than Denny's on the Strip and the options in MGM Grand (for about half the price!)"}
{"text":"This review is based upon breakfast.   Yes, it is a diner like Dennys.  The food is about the same quality.   Didn't really like what was ordered.  New York Steak lacked taste.  The eggs are not real.   The hashbrowns were good, but the pancakes didn't taste like buttermilk pancakes.    The restaurant is old and there are rips in the upholstery.  The bathrooms need serious attention because they aren't clean.   This is a cheap option 1/4 block off the strip so don't expect much and you will be ok."}
{"text":"Very happy with experience, waitress was very attentive, i drank an entire cup of soda in front of waitress while ordering food,(always do that, checks to see if they pay attention) and not only did the waitress pay attention, and bring me more soda, but brought two extra glasses full and still kept an eye on me if i needed more. I love coco's, always have, great food, great atmosphere, great customer service!"}
{"text":"After our first day/night of pool partying & drinking in Vegas for EDC Week, my friend and I were in need of a good (budget friendly) brunch the next morning. Yelp to the rescue with nearby recommendations! We were staying at Aria and were able to walk to this off-strip diner... (though it was kind of a long walk in the heat).  Wait, there's a liquor store next door? That doesn't cost an arm and a leg for a bottle of (good) tequila?! DOUBLE SCORE!!  Walking in to CoCo's was like walking in to a mom and pop diner back home (Ohio) honestly. You get the greeting like you're an old friend who knows where everything is. Ordering was easy, the prices were friendly to our pockets and the servings were PERFECT!  We ordered brunch items and I cannot complain at all. Again, this put me in the mind of the good mom and pop diners back home.  Service was attentive... never really had to wait long for anything. I will definitely return to CoCo's during my next Vegas adventure."}
{"text":"This is THE place to go for breakfast.  Really!  Don't even think about going anywhere else.  You'll be sorry if you do.  The Cinnamon Roll french toast is unbelievable.    We went on a Sunday morning and it was getting a little crowded around 10am but the table turn over is fast so it doesn't take long to get one.  Awesome food, great service.  These days you can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"It was early one morning I woke up and I decided I wanted some breakfast. Didn't want to walk that far from my room at the MGM Grand. They magic of Yelp brought this place up so I tried it out.  I'm glad we came because the food was Pretty good. The pancakes are nice and fluffy just like I like them. We also got a side of the potatoes, which were good as well.   Prices are affordable here. The staff was very good and attentive. This is a good option to fulfill your breakfast fix if you have one."}
{"text":"Coco's is our come to breakfast restaurant in Vegas! We stopped by last night just for a slice of pie.  I'm not a fan of pie, but my fiancee is and he loved his lemon meringue pie.   Today we had the lumberjack breakfast which is always an ole faithful.    2 eggs.  2 sausage.  2 bacon.  Ham and Potatoes and French toast.  Wow.  Great deal.   We also had a brioche egg sandwich with potatoes.   The whole bill $28 with tax.   Our hotel had an egg breakfast for $28.  No coffee plus delivery and Tip.    It is what it is.  Just you're average diner with inexpensive food.  No frills.     We will come back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Really good, reasonably priced restaurant for breakfast. My food was really very good. I had the Breakfast Special. The power to the block went out before my food arrived, but the kitchen kept right on cooking. The large windows allowed in plenty of light.  I liked this place so much that I ate breakfast there four days during my week stay in Las Vegas. I wish I had found it sooner.  It is within walking distance from MGM Grand, New York, New York, Excalibur and Tropicana."}
{"text":"When you don't want to pay $19.99 for the breakfast buffet, this is the place to go for $5 breakfast specials. In fact, I would only come here for breakfast. Why waste money anywhere else when you can get yummy food for cheap."}
{"text":"Standard Coco's menu but this location is a little tired looking. Needs a good scrubbing from top to bottom. Service was nice but not a standout in any way. For was the Coco's standard egg breakfast. Nothing bad to report but also didn't have any wow moments here."}
{"text":"For a Coco's on the outskirts of Las Vegas Blvd, this was not bad. I had the potato pancakes with sausage. The potatoes were not very crispy and a tad mushy on the inside but the flavor was ok. The sausage was delicious though! Service was nice and attentive and refilled our coffees and waters often."}
{"text":"When we stopped by this restaurant for quick breakfast on our way to the airport, we didn't expect to end up giving 4 stars for a seemingly typical American breakfast chain, but that's because the food quality was well beyond we could've ever imagined.  We had Blueberry Pancakes and Denver Potato Pancakes Combo, and both items were amazing. The concept, presentation and taste went all above average.  If you're still in doubt, look at my pictures - and decide if you believe me or not."}
{"text":"This place had horrible breakfast, service and the bathrooms smelled to the point of making my mom puke. And dirty bathrooms = dirty kitchen. Never again!"}
{"text":"We went to Coco's on a Thursday Night for dinner. The place has a nice view of the golf course. I was expecting it to be like the other Coco's in the area. But to my surprise in Surprise it wasn't like the others Coco's. They had Karaoke going on. I just wish it was on there web site stated it because we would have gone some other place. The food and service was good. Another thing to my surprise in Surprise there was a dog sitting at one of the benches too. We are pretty sure I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good service and location! Price was fair, little more than expected tho!"}
{"text":"I have been missing cocos for almost 4 years now!  I LOVE the cream of broccoli soup!!!!! I got my fix today! Diego and Junior are amazing! We have not had this great of service since I can't remember when. They were on point,  listened and we're engaging. Oh man the food was hot and fresh!!!! Soup was steaming hot! My french dip! Oh my god!! The French bread was to die for! Fresh baked and so good! Great people and good... can't beat that!! Definitely going again and again and again!"}
{"text":"gotten sick of overpriced food in the casino, saw the yelp reviews and decided to give Coco's a try, the ambiance is your average neighborhood IHOP kind of place, Ordered their everyday breakfast special for 5.99 which included 2 eggs, 2 sausage links, breakfast potatoes, toast and coffee...can't beat that price! Food came out relatively quickly in about 10 min, Portions were good and fresh, we ordered the croissant too and that was good as well, our waiter Javier was very friendly and attentive , a really  good experience overall! Would come back again"}
{"text":"Came across this place by accident. Prices are really reasonable and the food is pretty good. I had the Blackened Baja Barramundi and my friend had the prime rib BBQ burger. The fish was nothing special but the zucchini and rice pilaf were good. Overall could have been warmer. The burger had really good flavor.  We came at 5:30 pm (soon after arriving in Vegas). There were only two other people eating, so I would expect the food to be fresher and hotter."}
{"text":"When my husband and I went he got the country potatoes and there were several pieces that were black and it was not burnt it was bad potatoes he was in the restroom and had to wait to use the stall because someone was in it when the person came out my husband went into the stall and noticed it was a chef and he ran his hands under the water and did not even wash them with soap then went back to cooking food my husband came out and told me that made us sick to her stomach so we could not eat the rest of our food the manager there is rude when we told him what happened we came back the following day 2 find out what he was going to do to reconcile the situation he told us that he cannot ask the chef because you did not come in that day it's like why would you ask the chef if he washed his hands before going back to cooking yeah thank is going to tell the truth and how the likely he would get fired because you can make someone sick really the only thing the manager could offer us was a piece of pie really Coco really needs to do something about that manager and that chef"}
{"text":"Busy on a Saturday morning. Took 5 minutes to ask if I could be seated at their bar counter. If you are looking for a good portion to price this place has it. Omelette comes with choice of potatoes and choice of bread including pancakes so it very filling. Good breakfast spot after a night out on the Strip."}
{"text":"My family and I were able to take shelter at your location in last Vegas the night of the shooting on October 1st 2017. My wife took my sister in law towards Cocos after had been told not to enter hooters and to go to mgm to be safer. The type of vehicles driving up and down Tropicana Blvd was erratic and dangerous  people were being ran over from fleeing the mass shooting. So my wife headed away from the strip towards cocos. A gentleman signaled them to come into enter cocos and they entered. My wife and her sister waited bunkered down in rear of dining rm till my father,mother in law and I reunited. The staff took us in with open arms and any help they could offer they did. They made sure everyone had water and wasn't hurt. The restroom was readily available. They helped us barricade the windows and doors till fbi, sherrifs and paramedic arrived to. Even after the lockdown was cleared we were welcomed to stay as long as we needed. We exited around 2:45am the night of the shooting. I would like to thank the staff on duty at the time  of the mass shooting. They stayed calm cool and collected. Two gentlemen in particular helped out and didn't sit down once through the whole situation except for the one duck and cover we experienced at some point in the night but other than that they worked all through the night to make sure we were safe. Thank you Cocos for hiring such staff. They deserve recognizing honors for the efforts and calm attitudes.  My name is Anthony Felix and I thank you and the staff for giving us shelter. Please pass this on to the staff and just let them know I appreciate them for every thing they did and my family feels the same way"}
{"text":"I come to Las Vegas once a year. But I'm so busy I don't have time to check out some big places. This restaurant is close and open 24-7. They have always been good to eat at and never had a problem.   I'm from the south so this is like going to IHOP. The service, food and the wait time is even short. I will go back in a heartbeat if I need somewhere quick and tasty."}
{"text":"The service was good enough. The French toast was a bit tasteless. The waffle was good after a night in Vegas. Very affordable and walking to Hooters after was fun. We didn't have a wait, but we also went at 7:00am."}
{"text":"Not to bad couple things I could point out but all around decent place to eat like a Denny's"}
{"text":"I placed an order for a pie and instead of notifying me right away, they waited until my pick up time to tell me that they weren't going to be able to get it done. Will not ever be using them ever again.  I would give them 0 stars if it was an option."}
{"text":"A server sat us down and then completely forgot about us. Luckily Donna overheard our conversation about the lack of service and came to take our order. She was very sweet and attentive. The food was pretty good compared with what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Servers didn't care about serving at all. Tried taking my grandpa out for a nice breakfast and it took 47 minutes for our food to come out and the waitress didn't do a good job of checking on our drinks, needless to say I will not be going back and my grandpa and I will find somewhere else to eat pleasantly. Would not recommend, unless you like watching people not do their job."}
{"text":"Tamara was a fabulous server. The eggs Benedict were delicious.  It's a cozy, homey, and reminded me of my grandma's house. I paid $27 for 2 breakfast meals, 2 coffees, and tip.  And we tipped over 20%."}
{"text":"I went to this location today, April 2nd, 2015. This is the first time in write a review in Yelp but today I said to myself: I have to take time to review this place and I may be able to save human civilization from going to this horrific place. After waiting for almost an hour for our breakfast, the lady, Carmina was her name, came to our table and said: tell me again what you ordered because yours was never placed.  I was in aw when I heard the lady, without even offering an apology, that we needed to order again. The way she said it made me believe that it is so common at this place to just have the costumer wait for an hour for their food then tell them to order again. When I was walking out I explained to the girl at the register what just happened and it was like I didn't exist. If you are like me, who is constantly reading reviews at Yelp, don't go to this Coco's."}
{"text":"Well I just called 5 times in a row to find out if cocos serves breakfast all day and no answer. Super annoying and a giant waist of time."}
{"text":"We found CoCo's in an attempt to escape the high priced cafes in the Hotels.  All we wanted was a Greasy Spoon to fill us up without emptying our pockets and Coco's was the ticket.  They are open 24hrs serving a full menu.  We wandered in here searching for breakfast fare and we were not disappointed. They have a vast breakfast menu consisting of stuffed Crepes, French Toast, Pancakes, Omelets and any other kind of combination that you could want.  I didn't pay much attention to the Lunch/Dinner menu but it seemed to have just as much variety as the breakfast.     The Wait staff was very friendly and accommodating.  My only regret is being too stuffed to try some of their bakery items which looked very tasty.  For the money, quality and escape from the bright lights, you can't go wrong with Coco's."}
{"text":"If you're staying at MGM, NyNy or anywhere around there, just go here for at least breakfast! We all know that Vegas is a tourist trap and can get expensive. Save your money for the gambling, clubs, drinks and the nice nights out and grab breakfast or lunch here. Surprisingly extremely fresh food for \"what you should expect\" prices. Fix your hangover with a short walk out of your hotel and grub out, and head RIGHT NEXT DOOR!!! to the liquor store to grab your pregame/to-go drinks for the day. So happy I saw this place out of my hotel window and decided to try it. Between Coco's and the convenient liquor store next door, had to save us $80-$100+ for a 4 night stay. If you know Vegas, you won't think that's an exaggeration"}
{"text":"Conveniently located a couple of blocks east of the Strip. Price was still on the higher side but everything was delicious and wait staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"Foods just ok and overpriced. But on the plus side were the only ones under 70 so we feel young!"}
{"text":"The food that we got was okay seemed like it got cold sitting waiting to be brought to the table a few things were wrong that we ordered as well. Just a normal diner atmosphere if u want something nice and plain after a hangover and before a long drive."}
{"text":"Chose this place because it was convenient and got pretty good reviews on Yelp.   It was not bad. I got Tex Mex scramble.  Being from Texas this was kind of mild but was still very good. You get lots of food - egg scramble, hash browns and 2 pancakes.  I was stuffed. My wife wanted Belgian waffles but they don't serve them after 11:00 AM. She got pancakes with blintz cheese and raspberry sauce.  She said they were good.   The people are friendly and service was prompt.  We got right in but there was a line when we left about 12:30 PM."}
{"text":"Worst experience at Cocos tonight. Food took an hour and was cold and over cooked. Waitress was nice but way over run as they had just fired several people and were seriously understaffed.  One of our party walked out it was so bad. Manager wanted to argue over whether we should pay for the three sips of soda he had before he left. We had to tell them our food had been up in the window for a while before they brought it to us. Not a good day at Cocos."}
{"text":"Just amazing. Had the best breakfast here and I was so annoyed with myself that I didn't go back for the pies. Decor is old and dusty, but it adds to the charm.  Orange juice was good, bacon cooked to perfection and the pancakes... Just wow. And the bill at the end, even better. Such good value.."}
{"text":"Meh. Sad but it was just meh. Had pie on the visit. It's freaking pie. And it was meh. So sad"}
{"text":"I came here with friends on a weeknight recently.  We'd heard they had really good pie.   The restaurant is big and good for groups. I ordered the tomato soup and an avocado, arugula and bacon sandwich and a beer. The soup was delicious.  The flavor was rich and the soup was served hot.  The service was good, even though once we finished eating the server didn't come back to our table for quite some time. The prices were fair.  We tried the pie and it was really good.  I'd love to come back here.  I like all of the food options and how tasty the food, desserts and drinks are. Again, its great for groups and families w. kids."}
{"text":"If you are getting fleeced for breakfast at Tropicana, this place is a 5 minute walk and the food is good, the menu is diner food - a lot like Denny's, and the prices aren't insane"}
{"text":"We were downtown, and my kdis grandma use to take them there all the time.  Out of nostalgia they wanted to stop here.  So we went in got a booth and I was SHOCKED!  There was literally trash and food all over.  I was going to ask for another booth and looked around to see they were all like that.  We ended up leaving, I mean can you imagine what the kitchen looked like. Not one person asked us why we were leaving or anything.  We just walked out."}
{"text":"Went in here (again) for pie. We got the Dutch Apple with ice cream and a banana cream. As usual it was great. Our server (with a broken finger, but not a broken nail) was great. Really friendly and professional at the same time. I will be back for pie again.   I actually had breakfast in here I think the day before too which was a really good. This time it was a guy with longer hair and glasses who was great too."}
{"text":"I don't know why my previous update did not take on Yelp (seemed to only change the date) so I am resubmitting: We have been meeting there weekly for nearly 2 yrs now and our server Joanie is awesome! She takes good care of our sometimes special needs and gives us the best service. I continue to recommend Coco's for group meetings or family gatherings.  The menu is not as diversified as we would like but that that withstanding it is still a great place that has been very accommodating and serves our needs well....definitely worth a second look for a small to large size group. Oh, and they serve breakfast all day. Thank you Joanie and crew for continuing to make us feel welcome!"}
{"text":"We took a group of 45 there two mornings for breakfast and they were ready for us, served us quickly and cheerfully, and got us on the road asap! The place was clean. The breakfast was basic (a good thing). The servers were fantastic. It looked like it would be too small to accommodate our group, much less have room for anyone else, but they did and everything was great. Thanks to the servers and managers here, you got our days off to a wonderful start!"}
{"text":"Gluten free pancakes, whole grain and nut pancakes, everyone is happy - no complaints = happy dad.  The restaurant is beat up seats ripped - very locals only.   Eggs and sausage are not as tasty as pancakes.   Overall very tasty"}
{"text":"This is a reasonably good priced breakfast, lunch or dinner place, comparing to other expensive places around. Parmesan chicken was juicy inside and crispy outside. One of the best I've had, just wish there was a bit more arugula salad on the plate. My friend had an omelette with harsh browns, which was very good  as well."}
{"text":"If your looking for good diner style eats this is the place for you! It's your typical local diner so like most diners the furnishes on this place can use upgrading. However, they keep this place very clean (down the the silverware). Our server was direct (not friendly but not rude). We weren't going to stay originally based on the looks of the place. As I was walking out I seen other people's food being brought to the tables and it looked amazing! So I tried the place out and I am glad I did. It was great to get a break from the expensive brunch deals and eat at a good price! Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Great food great view of a huge fountain.   outdoor seating over the golf course  Excellent prices  has a full bar"}
{"text":"What a dump, makes Denny's look like a 5 star location.   Cold coffee. Fresh fruit that was rock hard. Really hard. Service inattentive.   I guess the retired folks in Sun City Grand just focus on the cost. You get what you pay for.   Go to Mikey add."}
{"text":"We had a great time.  My husband had country fried steak and I had Parmesan crusted chicken.  It was delicious!!  Our server was Lisa H and she was on the ball and friendly.  I would definitely recommend.  We were too full for pie."}
{"text":"My family of 4 ate here for $40. 2 burgers, grilled cheese, chicken fingers. The food was good, staff good. The place is a bit run down however. Other than a serious remodel the value is excellent."}
{"text":"Pretty good quick eat. I had the cinnamon roll French toast and it was flavorful, delicious and thick. I found the bread crust to be rather thick but i guess that is to be expected with French toast. It came with bacon which was cooked well, although I wish it came with two more pieces. The orange juice tasted like it was from the concentrate but I also didn't ask before we ordered it."}
{"text":"Great service, food was ok. They did make up for my fruit cup being bad with a delicious hot muffin. Great prices!"}
{"text":"Great food & prices! Prime Rib is excellent and food was fresh and served with a smile. Furthermore, the food was 'delivered' in a timely manner. This was a pleasant surprise for us. We will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This Coco's was a goddess-send to me and the family during our summer trip to Las Vegas, simply put!  A short but sweet review follows..  First of all, the location was perfect.  The wife and I stayed at America's Best Value Inn right behind this little gem.  You couldn't have a more conveniently placed eatery.  Not only that, its located within an easy walk from the \"Four Corners\" area of Las Vegas Ave and Tropicana.  Secondly - its open 24hrs a day!  Craving breakfast at 5pm?  A t-bone steak at 4am?  THIS IS YOUR SPOT!  Thirdly - The food here is delicious!  The menu is varied and extensive...from cinnamon rolls as big as a plate to prime rib and everything in between!  Fourthly - The prices!  By Vegas standards, this place is a BARGAIN.  Breakfast specials from $5 on up?  I'm \"all in!\"  The prices here are very reasonable, especially when your not in the mood to binge on buffets.  Fifthly - The service.  Every time me and the family dined here, the waitstaff was very attentive and friendly - just the way it should be.  Really... there's not much more I can say about this place other than, if your staying in Vegas and want good food, a varied menu and a great price... this is your place!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Always understaffed.  I can't tell you how many times I've been there and they have one poor server working on half the tables!"}
{"text":"Picked up pies for thanks giving.  They were moist . Quick service . Staff was friendly.  Place needs to be remodeled"}
{"text":"The place was open at six as the sign stated. The waitress  was not overly friendly . There were no special someone for Saturday . I got their two eggs and links . The eggs very a little  salty . The hash browns could have been more  crispy .she refilled  our drinks. Food was fair."}
{"text":"By far beats minnesota breakfast. This was the only breakfast place we found that had hashbrowns while everywhere else we went had breakfast potatoes. We ordered the raspberry blintz pancakes with eggs meat and hashbrowns. Let me tell you their breakfast is worth flying to Las Vegas for!!!!! It is decently priced and located close to the strip if you are a tourist like we are. I'm telling you to check this place out while visiting or living in Vegas. They have a variety of things to order from burgers to breakfast. I wanted to stay another day just to eat there again. Will be back in a couple of weeks for round 2!!!! All the way from MiNNEAPOLIS,Minnesota"}
{"text":"Absolutely FANTASTIC!!! Service was fast and the food was hot. Pancakes were soft and buttery and the food was better than breakfast offered at the casinos. Will definitely come back on every trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Service excellent, food deserves 3.5 stars out of 5, but please, if you're never going to clean your coffee pots, don't bring them to the table to refil my cup!!!  Gross. How much filth is in your kitchen if you can't even clean a coffee pot that we all see?"}
{"text":"Always a must-visit place while we are in Vegas.  Right next to hooters and very close to mgm and tropicana.  Good prices, quality food, and ample servings   Or.... Pay $30/person for a scrimpy casino meal"}
{"text":"I have eaten at several different locations of Coco's. For some reason this one is always the one that serves the best food with the best service.  Having eaten a variety of foods here and never have had anything to complain about, is pretty close to a miracle. I bitch about everything. Even the steaks are always cooked as I ask, med-rare and they are tender and have a great flavour. I just wonder why this location? I guess I am just lucky my sister made me pull in the parking lot one morning."}
{"text":"Good choices for all the non bacon lovers ..the Turkey hash was great and the buttermilk biscuit . Omg they have pie...mmmm mmm mmm...word to the explorer dont follow Google maps to get here totally off..they're  right across from the MGM"}
{"text":"okay you are in Vegas and just want to have a decent breakfast without breaking the bank this is your restaurant.  The restaurant is old you see dust on the dividers and old decorations that probably has not been updated in years.  It's like a hole in the wall restaurant and caters to all walks of life.  We were there and saw 2 possible homeless men walk in asking for coffee and sugar bags, and a group of loud mouths tough talking family members.  Yes we would probably come back when visiting Vegas just because of the price and breakfast isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Not great big help turn over so service is sometimes bad food is just average nothing special but it's convenient if you live in Sun City Grand"}
{"text":"Food was great but the place looks little old and dingy.. Portions are big. Food cook fast."}
{"text":"I keep trying this place occasionally hoping it will get better. but it does not.  The food is great but the service is very, very substandard.  Takes forever to get waited on and coffee refills border on non-existent. When we went to pay, waited at the unmanned cash register for an eternity and were very close to being dine and dashers when somebody showed up.  We had a coupon and that confused the person and she said she had to go get the manager.  She was gone quite a while and finally, the manager came.  She smelled of cigarette smoke so had obviously been outside smoking.  This is my last attempt to eat here.  Too bad the pies are to die for.  I will have to go back and pick one up and take it home."}
{"text":"I haven't had a place make me want to run home and do a review in a while.  We were staying at the Hooter's hotel and decided to grab dinner at Coco's.  I am vegan so finding options to eat is not always easy.  The two older women who work at dinner time were extremely sweet and helpful.  I was able to create a salad that wasn't on the menu and it was delicious! I think my order may have been the most complicated because I was inquiring about different vegetarian options to check if they were vegan.  They even had to call the owner to verify some of the items lol.  Well at the end my salad was huge and filled with all my favorite foods.  I give this place two thumbs up and will definitely keep returning. :)"}
{"text":"Who knew? I didn't, prior to eating here the first time, know that Coco's has an outstanding breakfast menu! The food taste great! For a chain, I think it is some of the best breakfast you can find around! Their pancakes, my favorite, are great! This is about the 3rd or 4th time that I've eaten here. I've never been disappointed with the breakfast. I haven't tried the rest of the menu unfortunately. What keeps them from getting five stars...today... is my server. I haven't got much attention from him, which I don't mind, but he hasn't been the friendliest. He is not rude by any means; he is just here. Oh well, time to dig in!"}
{"text":"I've never came to a place where I've felt so upset, irritated and uncomfortable to where I had to tell you all about. My family came into this restaurant around 1 am Monday. There was nobody when we came in (that Shoulda been a sign from the start ) . We waited over 45 min for our food. Let me remind you that we were the only ones in there . When the food finally came out . The waitress just threw our plates on the table. She didn't ask if we needed syrup for our pancakes , ketchup for our fries or napkins. Top it off my sister in law didn't get her plate. Never coming back. Waitress was very rude. Would rather have gone to Denny's down the strip. Do not go here"}
{"text":"Had some breakfast this morning at cocos my boyfriend ,sister and i loved it...rite infront of our motel..open 24 hours ...good service"}
{"text":"I can't believe I never tried a Coco's before.  I thought they were just another over prized same stuff Denny's type of restaurant and to my surprised, as I looked through the breakfast portion of the menu at what I thought would be the normal eggs and pancake stuff, I was quite blown at the variety they had to offer.  I had their tomato basil omlett and I knew I'd be going to a coco's near home to get this again breakfast or not.  I probably could have eaten off the kids menu too and have been satisfied with the amount they give them too.  Pancakes and French toast too are  on a different level compared to Denny's and IHOP.  Decors are still in the 80's, but that's ok, food and service was great!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, which is why we come--4 of us visited for breakfast.  Fast checkout at the register, and our food came up quickly.  Waitress forgot muffin, never did bring it, but she was good at coffee refills.  She seemed a little harried--said they got a big run all at once.  It wasn't half full, and didn't seem that busy Thursday morning 10AM Aug 18.    There was a man at a booth with 2 dogs--one a service animal, both of them up on the booth seat and eating from his plate.  That was kind of gross.  I don't think they were both service dogs, and it was kind of gross to see the eating from his plate at the tabletop in the restaurant.    Ladie's bathroom had a sewer smell.    There are hardly any Coco's left in AZ--most of them closed (and those that closed had very poor service, the ones I visited--it's a favorite restaurant for breakfast).  So this one is a bit further for us to go.  It seems to be a neighborhood restaurant.    There was a meeting room, but I don't think I'd use it for a professional meeting."}
{"text":"We just had an event at this Coco were we used the back room for 40 people.  Earl the manager was great, the service was great and the food was great."}
{"text":"Service good, food OK and prices reasonable. On of the cheaper breakfast options in LV."}
{"text":"My husband and I after a fun night of gambling, margaritas, and shows decided to stop in at coco's for a very early morning breakfast before we go to bed at 2 in the morning. It's Vegas, Right! Johnathan was the nightly Host and server. Let me just say what a pleasure to have such pleasant person great us and take our order. He was a multi-tasker extrodinair! We had our orders, food and excellent service within minutes. I must say we had the lumberjack slams - French toast, sausage, egg, bacon, ham and seasoned country potatoes $11.49 (great deal). Hats off to the chef! It was delicious and quickly devoured. John was checking on us frequently and our drinks never dry. Thank You John!! Food was 5/5, and service 5/5. We will come back again."}
{"text":"The food was a five but the service not so...made me ask for coffee like 5 times she kept forgetting... I would go back though"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Don't let the restaurant fool you. You may feel like you're risking your life by eating here but it's super delicious and fresh. The staff was so nice and the take very good care of you."}
{"text":"The raspberry brioche French toast thing was amazing. My boyfriend got a steak and it was okay but the zucchini was Grilled to perfection and the sweet potatoes were pretty good too. Really good food for when you're up at 3am. Would definitely go here again when in Vegas next time!"}
{"text":"This has been a wonderful n fulfilling experience. My husband had the ribeye dinner n I had the salmon. Our waitress Donna was by far the best server we have ever had...Food was hot n delicious. Not rushing us out, Donna  recommended desert, PIE, which was fresh and absolutely amazing ...We look forward to returning n requesting Donna as our server!!!"}
{"text":"Have you ever thought to yourself I wish my breakfast had more excitement? Coco's has got you covered. Things I watched during breakfast: someone trading weed for money, some literally double fisting a bottle of gin and an orange juice, a group sharing a 40 oz, and a couple pulling up in a S-class MB with a woman not willing to get out with the previously mentioned group outside of her car. It's a good reminder of how big of a shift the area can be just off of the Strip.   As for the food, it's a chain bakery / diner. I enjoyed my cinnamon roll French toast. I asked for my bacon crispy, and it was cook just how I like it. The waitress was very pleasant and efficient. Overall, I think I like the food because it reminds me of my hometown, but I don't need this kind of excitement when I want to eat. I'll just stick to getting it delivered.   5 for the waitress 4 for the food 1 for location  Avg. 3 1/3 stars"}
{"text":"Ok this was a great place to go for good food and not horribly expensive food.  The wait staff were pleasant and the food was great.  I'm happy that I didnt have the same problems others seem to have with how busy it was."}
{"text":"Decided to go here after having 2 bad meals at Hooters....food price & service was good...would so go again!"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price.  I ate here twice and was thoroughly impressed both times."}
{"text":"Um.  No.    I can't bring myself to give any more than one star:  It had air conditioning and chairs to sit on.  The chairs didn't break when we sat on them.  The air conditioning worked.    Wait staff was absolutely horrible (made us wait very long time before we even got menus, then got distracted when it came time to pay the check).    I swear this kitchen belongs on kitchen nightmares.  The salad was downright scary (I didn't eat it because I didn't want to get sick), the water glasses had COFFEE STAINS ON THEM (how does that even happen?!), and what edible food there was was simply average.  Manager solicited our feedback then CUT US OFF after we got 3 words out.  (Us: \"Well, we kinda ... \" Him (interrupting): \"Thank you for your business\")  Yeah.  If you see this place, don't walk -- RUN to a different restaurant."}
{"text":"We had the cinnamon roll french toast, meatlovers omelet & sides. Everything was so good! The biscuits & gravy was exceptional a must try.. Our server JT rocked it"}
{"text":"Had parmesan crusted chicken dinner. Garlic mashed potatoes were delicious yet don't need the parmesan cheese or cream sauce. Salad was very bitter. Chicken wasn't very good.  However, the chicken piccata dinner was outstanding."}
{"text":"If you haven't... You should! AMAZING! IHOP, Waffle House & Denny's have NOTHING on this place. Even the lunch/dinner is to die for!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, GREAT prices for Vegas. Was in town for a conference and the 'okay' quality of $25 breakfast buffets made me search out other options in walking distance. This was worth the 12 minute walk!  Large menu with lots of options at great rates - you can do a full standard American breakfast for 7.99!  I went back a few times and tried different items in the breakfast menu - everything was good, diner style.  Service was fine - a little slower during the busy periods, but not unexpectedly. They got one of my orders wrong, but were able to remake it fairly quickly.  Coffee was nothing to write home about, standard diner quality, about as good as the free hotel coffee.  If I'm back and nearby again, I'd eat here again!"}
{"text":"We enjoy the breakfast and lunch and Cocos, but can not recommend this place for dinner. We tried the turkey and it was bad.No other word fits.  The burgers are fine, if you go there for dinner stick to them. The service is good and the pies are excellent. Stick to what they do best and you will be happy."}
{"text":"We discovered this spot via Yelp at 5am on Columbus Day because we were probably the only tourists up that early. This first visit was decent, with a pleasant waitress and acceptable coffee. My hash browns were plentiful but undercooked. The fresh fruit consisted of a few small slices of cantaloupe and honeydew. The hub's breakfast special was just okay. Considering there aren't many breakfast options that early, I'd suggest giving it a try. HOWEVER, don't go when it's wicked busy (probably from 8am to noonish). Our second visit with a party of 6 was just short of a disaster. Wrong orders, cold food and no coffee refills. The wait staff seemed pretty overwhelmed. Not a good thing in a big tourist town. Clearly, it's the earlier the better with this one."}
{"text":"This location was exceptional.  Diego who was our server had numerous table and was calm and collected and still gave great service under pressure with being busy. Never had an empty glass and our food was out prompt. The food was on point and tasted great. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere.  Good food.  Zenayada was an excellent server as are the entire staff - nobody was confused or shouting at each other.  Very professional.  Nice location near Hooters and Tropicana  on Tropicana blvd."}
{"text":"Seriously  I don't know how this place has such high ratings. We choose plAces based on their ratings in tripadvisor & yelp. What a mistake.  It's filthy with a decor that has hanging paper streamers from the ceiling & plastic flowers everywhere. The waiter Javier was a very pleasant & well mannered young man but everything else was disgusting. The menu was tattered & worn out, the grime on the windows, floors & tables is horrific. The place hasn't been cleaned in years."}
{"text":"Place looks decent from the outside but once you enter the restaurant, there are flies flying around everywhere and the place seemed old and filthy. The wait to be seated was not too long considering it is Father's Day, however the filth was unbearable. I'm talking about nasty smushed food stuck in between menu pages, seats are covered with crumbs and greasy finger prints, water spots on silverware, tables don't get wiped down with sanitation towels and I can go on, and on-but you get the point. Never going back! I'd rather starve..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast & ordered their French Toast what a mistake that was! It was terrible. The cook didn't soak the bread in an egg mixture with sugar & vanilla. End result: tasteless. I couldn't believe anyone could screw up French Toast but they did. Their prices are too high for what they give you."}
{"text":"Coco's is awesome. They have free range eggs and all their food is a good price for a good amount. The food is very fresh as well. Way better than Denny's and IHOP."}
{"text":"It's Coco's--how special can it be? Well believe it or not, we had an exceptional visit to this location to celebrate a birthday in our family. My inlaws don't like to leave the perimeter of Sun City West/Grand so we are limited in our selection of restaurants. And this location has been a lot of different restaurants in the past, but I think it will see success as a Coco's. The service was excellent, our food was served at the right temperatures and the wait was minimal at best.   We look forward to going back--which is tough to say with a Sun City restaurant but this Coco's has earned another try! :)"}
{"text":"Food was okay. But it was way too cold in there better take a jacket with you. Several people surranded by us were saying the same thing and some were even going to their car for sweaters. I asked one of the waitresses if they usually ran their a/c that cold and all she said was yeah."}
{"text":"Deux petits dej la bas, le menu est plutôt varié, les pancakes sont bons et grands mais un peu bourratifs (possibilité de demander une box si on n'arrive pas à finir). J'ai aimé le bacon, qui ici n'est pas crispy contrairement à certains dinners américains ou on a l'impression de manger du bacon frit. Bref sans surprise mais bon et pas cher, c'est déjà bien!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience, eggs burned and my brothers wife plate had a hair in her food, they messed up on my brothers order as well, so we had to wait long for them to make it again. I didn't touch my plate because I was disgusted after seeing the hair in the food and they still charged my plate for something I didn't eat, horrible customer service skills. WONT ever eat here again and won't recommend it either"}
{"text":"First were seated and have to listen to some rude child blast some show on their parents phone. Really? If your child can't be out in public without a device to entertain it leave your child at home! Stop being inconsiderate to others! Then my husbands food arrived ice cold! Are you not a restaurant that is supposed to serve hot food? Seriously! Horrible experience"}
{"text":"Nice stuff,very cute restaurant with delicious food! I will definitely go back to eat there when i will visit vegas again!"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast with a client.  I ordered the side of fresh fruit and was served rock hard cantaloupe and honeydew melon. That's all. Not another scrap of fresh fruit was available to be found. Pathetic."}
{"text":"My service was good, but the food was very mediocre. They may have decent breakfast items. I saw a lot of people order that. I chose the steak and shrimp. Bad idea. The cut of meat was terrible. It was almost like a roast and the sides we very bland. They didn't have the baked potato that came with the meal either. My waiter was very nice but I wouldn't recommend this place.Being close to the strip, I thought it would be somewhat decent."}
{"text":"This review is strictly on dinner .... Fish and chips looked good but there was no taste it was tasteless for the fish and as well as the fries and the coleslaw was sour.  The steak and shrimp scampi looked like puke on the plate everything was slopped together and looked unappetizing steak overdone but the scampi was edible.  There was 8 of us and the only saving grace was the pies if not for dessert everyone would have walked out hungry"}
{"text":"Have been visiting this Coco's for several years after taking family to doctor appts. I like their menu. I like their staff. It's a nice friendly place to go sit down have something good to eat and talk. If it's HOT outside you can go in order some iced tea and it will be nice and cool inside.  If its chilly outside it will be toasty warm and they have coffee. Their soups are YUMMY! Tried the butternutsquash for the first time, really liked it!!"}
{"text":"Service was great the waiter was very attentive when I came here for breakfast. The food was mixed. I had the egg white omelette with tomato feta and basil but there was no basil they chef put in spinach as a substitute which was fine but it did not add any flavor to the omelette. The food was piping hot but very greasy. My son had the banana walnut Carmel pancakes they were awesome but the sausage was gross fatty and had an odd flavor. The decor was extremely dated looked like a cocos from 1988 and the place could use a deep cleaning"}
{"text":"I used to be  an Assistant Manager here  and I loved being here and working here, I loved to inneract with the guests all the time,my favorite day was Thursday night when they held Karoke..let me tell you!! Alot of the customers could really sing and it was inspiring to listen to them all, what was really great is if you had a favorite Singer best believe that they will be there every Thursday from 4 to 8..... It's a must hear!! There voices are that good!!! Even I used to sing a song every other week or so..and while your listening to the Amazing Kareoke singers enjoy a ice cold alcoholic beverage from the FULL bar..and there Prime Rib and Pies are unreal  and there is alot more to enjoy then that, just gonna have to come in and try it yourself to all my guests that I was close to take care and keep comingback .............Rob Benham"}
{"text":"Probably the least expensive food you're going to find in LV! Had a delicious cobb salad that kept me going for the next leg of my roadtrip."}
{"text":"Typical diner with a bakery as well. Can't comment on the bakery, but breakfast was good. Reasonably priced for the amount of food. Pancakes and California omlet  were good fuel for an afternoon checking out the strip."}
{"text":"It was another late night, as is the norm with me on certain days of the week.  Instead of going through some drive-thru for a quick bite to eat, I opted to dine at this establishment as it was along my route home.  When I arrived, the very first thing that I noticed were the unkempt tables that needed some cleaning. It appeared that they had a rush, and none of the tables were cleared. 45 minutes later, the tables were still in the same state as they were when I came in.  I proceeded to use the bathroom, and it was just plain disgusting. On my way back to my table, I noticed that the floor preparation area was littered with a multitude of debris from napkins, utensils, packets of sugar / salt / pepper / sweetener, and even butter packets!  At this point in time, 45 minutes later, the salmon that I ordered finally arrived.  However, the horrific attack on my visual senses and the surrounding disarray was simply too much for me to take; especially after a very long day.  I consumed what I could, asked for my check, and promptly left. I had such high hopes for my first visit here in over a decade; as I used to have very fond memories of late night dining here with friends.   Now, all I have are visceral nightmares from my recent experience."}
{"text":"I usually rate my favorite place 5 stars! My waiter Luis is excellent w/ his service! BUT MY issue is it's so damn hot in there! What's up with that! Is the AC going out or trying to be conservative? Please someone put attention to this because I don't want to step coming to my favorite place! Eat comfortable when it's so darn hot in the restaurant!!!! I love coming here, I'm always greeted w/ a smile. I love there breakfast items BUT they also have a delicious lunch/dinner menu!  Today I had fried shrimp, delicious mashed potatoes w/ country gravy & fried zucchini...very very good! I only wish I didn't have to use MY WIFI minutes. The WiFi never ever seems to connect on Coco's free WiFi... it's been like this for far too long..."}
{"text":"I was driving home last night when I had a craving for a fresh peach pie to bring home and surprise my family. After walking up to the front counter I noticed that there was no fresh peach available. The manager Aurelio ask can I help you? I said \"Any FPP available\"? He said we are out. If you can give me 7 minutes I will make you one.  I was surprised of what he said! That is great customer service and a great FPP.  Thank you for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"God bless Zenayda  I was so hungover. I hate Coco's. The one by my parents's house is disgusting. But I was hungover and unfortunately it was Sunday so our only other options were expensive ass brunches. No thank you.   This Coco's needs to hire new hostesses. It was so busy on St. Patrick's day morning and the hostesses were clueless. Maybe they were exhausted from partying the night before too? I dunno. lol. There was this busboy that took charge and he pretty much seated everyone. I used to be a hostess myself. Shame on you girlies for not being on your A game.  Zenayda was a rockstar and kept the coffee coming. I ordered a veggie omelette and holy guacamole it was HUGE. I of course am a fatty and hungover so I ate all of it and it was so good. Props to Jose in the back.   We had to pick up someone from the airport so she got us in and out of there super fast. Poor girl she had such a busy section. I watched as super picky people told the hostesses they kept wanting to sit in her particular section (I think she had the most booths). Why do you people like booths?! Booths are disgusting and uncomfortable gross.  Anyways this place was a lifesaver. Drank enough coffee for three days, ate enough omelette for three days, and got out of there in like 30 minutes lol. Thank you honey you made it possible for me to go through the rest of the day and party it up later for my birthday."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place!  I was staying at MGM for Labor Day weekend and my buddy wanted to try something different vs MGM's cafe since there food sucked, so we came here and I'm so happy we did.  The steak and eggs were sooooooooooooooooooooooo good!  I had the identical dish at the cafe and the beef was nasty.  But, here, it was cooked to perfection, the service was top notch, and the prices were really reasonable!  Plus, I found out that they served sugar free apple pie, so we came back for some  dessert before hitting the town.  Overall, this place rocks, so I'll be going back here next time I'm at MGM."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast on a budget! The chorizo skillet was amazing.  My husband who measures 6'4 220lbs was unable to finish the skillet.  Cons- the place is extremely dated and fits the description of a \"dive diner.\" However the friendly staff and food out weighs the aesthetics.   Do not leave without the sizzling skillet breakfast.  It is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great food and service - very well done.  Three of us had hearty breakfasts and all good. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Hugely surprised of this place!!!! First time to stop here as I was not a fan of Cocos in past . This place has amazing view on golf course , waterfalls .... Beside, FULL bar of alcohol !!!! Enjoying my margarita !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure if we just came in on the bad overnight chef or what, but this is the worst food I've ever had. Everything was slimy and tasted odd, french toast was warm, not hot, the sausages look awful. Neither of us could finish the meal, and that says a lot. The coffee is not very good at all, the menus on yelp are outdated, the table and silverware were dirty, etc. There was a gaping hole in the ceiling from water damage as well. The server, John was the only thing saving this place from getting one star; he made sure we told him that we weren't satisfied even after we kind of tried to play it off. Good for him for caring, and he did offer us a slice of pie as recompense, but we can't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I have been on a restricted diet for several months and need everything I eat made to very exact specifications.  This was no trouble for the folks at this Coco's location.  Susan, our waitress, was amazingly polite, professional and immediately took ownership of making sure my meal was perfect... and it WAS!  We've been back several times and brought friends.  This is a great little place with good food and good prices."}
{"text":"Stopped in to buy a chocolate cream pie for the family.  I've had cocos before and loved it. I Even told my family how great there pies were. However not this cocos. I got the chocolate cream pie to the resort.  And it was not good at all. Taste like a sugar free pie. I called and the manager and he said he would return it. I thought that was nice. So I took the pie back and got a coconut cream pie. Got it back to the resort and omg can u believe it was even worse. It should have been called a coconut pie. Minus the cream. It wasnt even edible.  I did not call back. It was a waste of my money and time. Goes to show you. Not all chain restaurants are equally satisfying."}
{"text":"Great place to eat at a reasonable price on the strip. Wait staff is super friendly and attentive. I've only had breakfast here but both times it was delicious!  Pancakes are the best!!!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was friendly! Happy hour was awesome! Linda was our server and she was very sweet! Ask for Linda"}
{"text":"I live in Sun City Grand, so this place is convenient, the food is OK, and there's a spectacular view.  That's as good as it gets.  The problems are that it is usually under-staffed, so there is generally only one server for the entire place prior to 9 a.m.--the place opens at 6 a.m.  It often takes a long time to be seated, and it's hard to seat yourself, since many of the empty tables still need to be cleared after the prior customers have left.  My main complaint is that they advertise \"fresh baked\" but then serve MICROWAVED biscuits that are sitting in a plastic bin on the counter behind the cash register.  These are not at all fresh, and microwaving day-old (or older) biscuits just turns them to rubber.  Even though I always ask for non-cholesterol egg substitute and dry toast (I won't order the biscuit any more), I know that the server or the kitchen gets it wrong when I can see egg white in my scrambled eggs & butter slathered over the \"dry\" toast.  With the light staffing, it's almost impossible to get a refill on water or coffee before you've finished your meal.  I've also been there for lunch/dinner later in the day, and the service is a bit better."}
{"text":"My friends were absolutely raving about how nice this place was and how great everyone was. It just seemed like a typical diner to me, which is generally decent food, decent service, and normal prices (especially for Vegas). I liked it, and depending on where you're coming from, you might love it :D"}
{"text":"One of the worst for placing orders to go they never answer there phone and when they do they never get the order right !! Warning don't call a order in !!!"}
{"text":"No wait at 8:30am on a Friday. Fast service and regular prices which don't exist in the casinos. Fed two of us for under $20. Here's why I'm giving five stars: our server asked if we wanted a water to go! Even offered my coffee in a carry out. No extra charge. Now THAT'S service!"}
{"text":"so the ratings are pretty high for this place but honestly they just do everything textbook. wait was slow and they were just at capacity, maybe if 4 parties came int he last party or two would have to wait.  got the french toast and eggs and bacon. all were fine but nothing extraordinary. id say just a shade above ihop. eggs were very oily.   ORDER: wait staff JEANS: OK by far  i wish i got the pies. this place is off the strip and next to howard johnson"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Coco's for a late lunch on a weekday after looking at homes in Sun City Grand.  Probably the most spectacular view of any Coco's in the country!  The restaurant and bar overlook the 18th hole of Granite Falls Golf course complete with flowers and waterfalls.  My Realtor and I got a nice table near the windows and a young man dropped off menus and came back with water and took our order.  I ordered a Chicken sandwich with a salad - blue cheese dressing.  After a bit I went to wash up and evidently our orders arrived in my absence.  My sandwich was not cut in half so was difficult to eat and the salad, which I should have ordered to be served first, came with no dressing of any kind.  My partner informed me that we had a new server.  After waiting for about ten minutes for someone to stop by or at least show their face in the restaurant, I took my lunch to the kitchen myself and asked to have the sandwich cut in half and could I please have some dressing for the iceberg lettuce, tossed salad.  A few minutes later our new server showed up with my lunch.  Of course, by this time my buddy was finished with his lunch.  Despite the spectacular setting it is still Coco's - mediocre food and in this case spotty service."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Service was terrible. Very unprofessional servers.  We walked in and expected it to be alright, 3 servers for a rather small place, so the idea of them being in the weeds is almost impossible, right? Wrong. Woman (wearing ridiculous makeup, don't know her name so that's what I am going by) sat us, and took my drink order, and not my fiancé's, and ran away, then it took us 15 minutes to get his drink from our actual server (Yaeko). The other woman was extremely unprofessional, yelling across the restaurant several times and even at our server. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"A pretty good little diner. Cinnamon French toast was tasty, coffee was relatively standard diner fare, at a reasonable price for being on the strip. Not worth a special trip but not a bad choice if you're looking to grab a bite in a hurry."}
{"text":"I find it hard to believe that anyone would rate a Coco's a 5 star experience, but to each their own. I happened to find this location pretty much ASS when I happened in here with Mom and Grandma in tow.   Growing up in Phoenix, Coco's and Bob's Big Boy (then JB's), and Village Inn were the only coffee shop type restaurants around and Coco's was always good. Sadly, the memory of the chain and the reality of this location didn't match up.   We arrived around 1pm on a Sunday and though it wasn't my choice to eat here, I agreed. Grandma was hungry and wanted pancakes. We walked in to a pretty packed restaurant and were seated fairly quickly by a teenage host. We sat and sat and sat and sat looking at our menus and me looking around at other tables who were also sitting to either order, get their checks or their food. Turned out not only was it the \"B\" team, it was probably the \"C\" team. When our waitress finally arrived to take our order, I realized she was the only one working the entire dining room and one other waitress was working the other half of the restaurant. The hosts (2 teens I noticed) were standing around basically doing nothing and the kitchen seemed behind on getting food out to customers.   Grandma had her pancakes-I had to track down the coffee to refill her coffee (and several other customers), Mom had a BLT which was skimpy and I had a cup of their soup of the day (cream of broccoli) which was like eating a spoon full of salt and nothing could help it go down.   I was surprised that this location especially being located in Sun City had such a lack of employees working. I was also surprised at the amount of families there-but I forget that Sunday is often go to lunch after Church day.  I will skip this location in the future and hit up the JB's next door (Village Inn?) or actually get some decent coffee shop type grub at Cracker Barrel down the street. Oh, and if Grandma wants pancakes again, I might even venture just past the 101 on Bell and hit up IHOP before I hit up this place again."}
{"text":"Coco's has a welcoming array of breakfast choices on the strip. If anything the bottomless coffee alone is worth it! Food great and customer service great. Minus one star for the septic odor."}
{"text":"Went to Las Vegas with friends, was looking for good \"Mom's & Pops\" breakfast/dinner.  Guess what, I found it. Seriously, great breakfast and brunch.  Las Vegas could be \"nickels and dimes\" for everything, I have tried few breakfast places on the strip and it was disappointing; but don't take me wrong, their food  was typical \"OK\",  I could make it myself if I could.  Coco's Family place does really stands out compare to many dinners and restaurants. Service is really good, its fast enough to believe that your food was cooked :). I don't like to throw \" very fast service\" cliche cause microwaved food is not cool thing! Their Eggs Benedict are excellent! I cant even add anything to it. They serve various types of breakfast from pancakes to egg and steaks.  The place looks like typical dinner, its clean and modest. If I will visit LV again, I will be back 100%."}
{"text":"It was very easy to find. We got in and seated right away. The food was quick and hot! The raspberry cream cheese pancakes were like heaven to my mouth! We're glad it's not in our home town or we'd be fat! Fat! FAT!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pancakes and French toast. Super rich orange juice (I actually had to water mine down). Fast, friendly and efficient service. Like all the buildings I've seen in Vegas, though, this one has ugly wear here and there if you look close enough."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. We enjoyed lunch with long-time friends, then succumbed to an outstanding looking  peach pie...to eat later at home."}
{"text":"Hello I went there for breakfast today and boy a lot you get for 7.99  pancakes bacon eggs so look for that it's called mega breakfast the server was wonderful her name was leesa  and there was a lot of people to help you"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of chain restaurants but they do serve good prime rib here, the baked potatoes are fresh from the oven and the bread is always good."}
{"text":"I would love to tell you all about the hot, delicious breakfast I DIDN'T get !!!! My boyfriend and I came here one morning, on a not-so-busy week day. We were seated and our orders taken relatively quickly. After about 5-10 minutes, another couple was seated near us and their orders taken. 15 minutes later, out came their pancakes, fruit, eggs, bacon, etc! WE STILL HAD NOT BEEN SERVED. Not only had we not been served but our server never came by to give us the word on what was going on, why it was taking so long, nothing! I mean come on, we ordered scrambled eggs and toast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Another 5-10 minutes went by and we finally had enough, so we just got up and left. The place was giving us the creeps anyway, its dingy as crap inside, crooked lamps, peeling paint, the bathrooms are straight out of hell, and we watched a man picking up garbage outside on his hands and knees walk back into the kitchen, AND NOT COME OUT!!! BELH!!!! What a joke, i'd rather starve than go back to this place."}
{"text":"Javier is an excellent waiter. He is extremely attentive and generous. Our breakfast was delicious. Last night's dinner exceeded expectations as well. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Good food! A lot to pick from on the menu. Very fast food service. And they have take out which is great! Only bad thing is we had a waitress that didn't speak English very well and brought us 8 glasses of water and there was only for of us! And then wanted to bring us more water! Wth!?"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in town I make a point to come here for breakfast or lunch. Great value for good food. You're hunger will be satisfied. You will enjoy the diner style atmosphere and food. Can't go wrong unless you're into the bling bling atmosphere for blah and small portion of food."}
{"text":"It is an amazing and warming place, waiters are great! I went for Breakfast and Dinner twice and all was remarkable! Prices are excellent and I can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  The location overlooking the golf course is great.  We've never had a bad meal, but especially love their omelettes, corn beef hash brioche & double pastrami sandwich.  Everyone is friendly & give great service."}
{"text":"I really liked thid place, as soon as we saw the menu we wanted everything on the menu. Average breakfast is $7.50 which is more then fair and food tasted fresh and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick breakfast on the way home from Vegas. It wasn't packed on a Sunday morning, which was perfect for us since we were in a little bit of a rush. I ordered the prime rib hash and egg, and my bf ordered the lumberjack meal. All-in-all it was good. Would come back if in a rush to leave, but if I wasn't, I would definitely go to some other more popular breakfast spot."}
{"text":"It's a very close distance to ny my hotel where we were staying. the prices are great. They have gluten free pancakes which is awesome. The food is really good compare to its price range. Nothing fancy but practically good."}
{"text":"Friends and I went to this Cocos location because it was on our way home and I have always had pleasant experiences with this company. I have to say, this is the worst Cocos location I've ever been at. The food made us feel sick, the service was horrible and the waiters and waitresses were rude. Our original plan was to go to National Pancake Day at IHOP. After seeing the line at IHOP we deiced to find somewhere else. I saw the cocos on the way home and we decided to stop there.   When we first got there, over 6 of their tables were dirty wish dishes piled high. The waitress came out and said there was a party of 30 and it would take an hour for our food to be out. She cleaned off a table and sat us. We accepted and started looking at the menus.   A random waiter came out, brought us our drinks and told us that they were no longer making pancakes, which is the reason we went there in the first place. We all decided to change our orders when our waitress came out and offered us the pancakes. We assume the cooks did not want to be bothered making more pancake batter and asked the waiter to tell us they were out.   Some time had passed and we were all out of water with no service. I asked another random waiter for water and our free bread basket that every cocos normally provides. He gave me a dirty look and went into the back. 25 mins later our waitress comes back and finally asks if we need anything. I asked for the bread basket and she rolled her eyes and explained that they didn't have any bread and started walking away. I had to raise my voice to ask again for at least the water refills.   When we got our food, it tasted fine, at first, but it made all of our stomachs hurt after a few mins.  It was the worst service I've ever received at a Cocos! I didn't even tip and I am always a generous tipper.   Also, this terrible service was from the night shift staff."}
{"text":"This place is just an ihop. Which isn't bad ....or good really, it just is and Id eat here again. The service and cleanliness were below average I think. The bacon here was disappointingly small and lifeless, like Kim Jong Un. The brioche buns were like Kim Kardashian, big, fluffy, sexy and even sweeter than they looked. The coffee here is like Rob Kardashian, it's kind of just along for the ride and brings nothing to the table. The menu overall has some shades of Bruce Jenner, too much going on and not quite sure of what it wants to be. If you want a decent priced breakfast or lunch, and you're not a little whiny bitch, eat here, this place is fine."}
{"text":"Used to be one of the most popular restaurants in Sun City, but their volume has gone down a lot in the last couple years.  Always famous for their cakes and pies and desserts, but also for their excellent food.  We have eaten their numerous times over the years and recently both the service and the food quality seem to have gone down.  Last time we were seated in the side room under an air vent and it was freezing cold in there.  No real reason to put us there since the main dining room was no where near full.  This has always been a place where the chain trains their newer servers before they go to other locations, but the service seems to have slowed down more recently.  The food is still decent and the service is OK, but I would have to rate it a 3 at best these days."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Vegas. Staff is super nice and allow me to hang out for hours in between flights and hotels. $3 wine and $4 huge salad you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"By far the best sunside eggs. The breakfast special is 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, hash browns or potatoes, toast or pancakes for under $7. Very busy, but they are quick. Service is awesome. Highly recommended if you are staying near hooters hotel."}
{"text":"The pancakes were decent.  The rest of my breakfast plate was inedible.  Poached eggs with uncooked yolk centers that probably would have made me sick had I dared to try them.  Tiny, shriveled, dry bacon slices.  The \"fruit plate\" was laughable - 4 small slices of unripe melon with the rinds still on.  Yuck, yuck, and double yuck.  You're on vacataion - do yourself a favor and spend a couple extra bucks on breakfast somewhere else that won't make you sick."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for breakfast, my cinnamon french toast was really good, but when I took a bite of my eggs and chomped down on a giant piece of eggshell that pretty much ruined it for me. The country potatoes have a funky after taste. Try and sit by the fountain, half way makes up for the crappy meal and slow service."}
{"text":"Wow! I was expecting a Denny's quality of food or a Carrow's quality, and was in genreal prepared for meh. But this shocked me! It was sooo good! Way above a Denny's or anything boring that I was expecting. It was reasonably priced too! The staff were very friendly and it came out quick and hot! I will absolutely come here again."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place after a night out in Vegas (especially if you're staying at the Motel 6 -- it's literally right across the parking lot).   Nothing amazing, but (very) generously portioned breakfast fare. Coffee was decent. After a road trip through the south I'd argue the biscuits were less than ok, and suggest you order a different side.  Come before 11 -- we had no wait at 10:30, but saw lines as the hangover crowd amassed half an hour later."}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast at anytime the food is amazing and the service is great! Our server April was on top of everything made our Sunday brunch an experience :) thank you!"}
{"text":"Decided to do a morning breakfast date with my littles before I took her to daycare. Right as I walk in the hostess asks me \"Is there something you need? \" Needless to say that threw me off.  I told her that I was there to eat and she showed me to a table. Our servers name was Javier.  He made up for the initial entrance with hostess. He was very polite and professional.  I had an order of eggs benedict with a side of fruit for my little girl. Overall food was decent, and hearty.  The hostess did come up to me to apologize for her actions. No hard feelings, she's young and seems newer to the industry.  Ask for Javier if this is your morning stop."}
{"text":"They hid the rotten avocado inside my omelet. When i called them on it, they fixed it. Raspberry n peach pancakes RULE."}
{"text":"This places is must try and must return while in vegas. I ordered their chorizo hash with pancakes and it was delicious.  Lots of flavor, great amount of food and their pancakes are just amazing. While in vegas is all about finding an affordable place to eat with great food and we hit the lotto with this place. I highly recommend it and like another yelper  said bellow their food presentation along is worth it. I love a good dive with amazing food and this place it for me. I knew it when I saw all the local staffers going their after their shift to eat."}
{"text":"This is a convienantly located breakfast establishment for some morning eats after a long night in Vagas accross the street from the MGM on Tropicana street. I would say it's similar to Denny's but slightly less expensive if you order their daily $7.99 special with 2 eggs, 2 bacon, hashbowns and either a biscuit or pancakes. If I ever visit again, I would try the biscuit since the pancakes and, especially the syrup, weren't very good. There are many much cheaper places in Vegas for breakfast but this is very convenient if you're staying at the MGM Grand or the hotels close by like Hooters."}
{"text":"I see a lot of bad reviews for this place?  This was my second visit and both were great.  Good food, good service at a fair price. Better than Denny's, IHOP and Village Inn!  I would recommend trying it for breakfast."}
{"text":"I really had a taste for the broccoli soup so we went for late dinner-8pm. Very little from the menu was left-no bread for our soup, only well done prime rib, reheated mash potatoes and to make it worse-pre cut up steaks! The server stated it's cause they cater to an older crowd and the service! Doesn't everyone who orders steak know it needs to be cut up?! If I order a steak I'd like to be able to cut it up myself and let it be an option for those who may like their food cut up for ease of consumption. Clearly being in Sun City Grande means they need to change their posted hours to close at 7 after the rush is over so people who stay out later enjoying our great weather can still get dinner-elsewhere! Everyone of the staff that we saw didn't greet us only stared at us for coming in an hour before closing causing a disruption to their socializing or cleaning up. Breakfasts or lunch maybe better but honestly I would probably just go elsewhere. Coco's usually has good food so any response from the management would only be to keep people from the truth-They don't care about their staff therefore the staff doesn't care about giving the customers a good experience."}
{"text":"Was really eyeing the Smoked Gouda Hash Omellet, right up to the point where the waitress says \"We're out of gouda cheese\" Ordered a ham and American cheese Omellet and of course \"No American cheese either\"  Ended up with a piece of ham and a pancake. Ham was tasty but lotta fat had to be trimmed off. Waitress came and checked on us AFTER we were done eating to complete the experience.   Too bad you cant eat scenery as the restaurant overlooks a golf course, very beautiful."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat jamie. Our waitress was wonderful she was polite and was vert effienti will return to eat and would like her to wait our table again"}
{"text":"First off - Prices on the menu photos here on Yelp are waaaay outdated... by like $2 an item! I updated a page on the menu... I forgot to do the whole menu before I left :(  Anyway - The food was okay. I ordered an Avocado Bacon Burger on whole wheat which arrived with a pretty lame fruit presentation... but nonetheless, was great after the burger.   Our server always seemed hurried and only asked us if we needed something when he was running past us? I don't get why servers do that? Oh well...  If you're staying at the MGM, it's conveniently right behind the hotel and much better than the RIDICULOUS wait we had at Denny's... will definitely give it another go next time I'm visiting."}
{"text":"Best breakfast that I've had in a long time! The place is a little run down, could use some remodeling, but the food and service is superb!  I would recommend the Gouda and potato hash omelet...potatoes hash is a Coco signature dish made of potatoes, onion, green pepper, mashed potatoes, spices (A-1 sauce), it is fantastic and I would order it again and again.  The meal is served with your choice of bread, potatoes or fruit, huge portions for around $10.  I had some fresh fruit too, which was melon, very good too."}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST gluten free pancakes ever! You can't even tell they are gluten free! If anyone wants to take me to breakfast, this will be my choice! I'm just sad they don't carry gluten free toast. There are so many ways to make things gluten free. Even Dennys carries gluten free English muffins."}
{"text":"Service very slow and she never came back to ask about refills and when she asked how meal was she went by so Fast delivering other food, I never got to say it was cold plus very tasteless. One of the worse breakfasts I have had. Only reason we went there was they close carrows. Why ??? It was delicious there. Why keep this place open. I was here years ago now I remember why I never Came back."}
{"text":"AVOID at ALL costs!!!  Horrible experience here for a Friday late morning breakfast and it wasn't very busy.  As I was half way through my meal I spotted a small hair, not a small below the waist hair but a hair nonetheless, it was toward the edge of the plate away from the food so I took a napkin and got rid of it. My very next cut into the pancake stack showed another longer hair in between the top and middle pancake. That was all I could handle and completely lost my appetite at that point. After I told the waiter and he took it away the GM came out and stated that he was going to comp my entire meal and that all of his cooks have the same length hair (like it mattered at that point). Then when it was time to pay (my friends was on me) the cashier started having network issues and had to swipe my debit card more than once and even took my card in the back which I really didn't like (fraud behavior). It finally went through and we were on our way. Then later that day I checked my balance like I do regularly and they had allocated my card THREE TIMES! Almost $60 dollars had been pulled on my card...nothing like a slap in the face after the tainted food. I was pissed and called to talk to the GM. He stated that they only show it being charged once on their register, but allocated three times and that two would fall off. I still was not ok with it and he even tried to blame it on my bank...what a joke. Three days later all but one fell off and finally cleared but what a complete joke and total hassle along with unsanitary conditions...ie no hairnets apparently. Like other reviewers have said it's a very old worn out restaurant inside (late 70's early 80's) and needs a remodel stat!  I will never be back to any Coco's after all of this!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I parked in Coco's giant parking lot and began to walk to the small vegan restaurant next door. The manager came running out yelling and told us the whole parking lot was for Coco's customers only. We had to move our car a quarter mile down the street to find a parking spot and walk all the way back in 112 degree weather. The parking lot was more then half empty! The fact that they have a manager just sitting by the window waiting for people to park and see if they walk into their restaurant or not is ridiculous! Horrible first impression, we will never be giving Coco's our business that's for sure!"}
{"text":"A friendly bustling atmosphere (definitely not quiet) combines with friendly service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Server was really nice but had too many tables. We never got drinks refilled or asked anthing else after the food came out.They need to hire more help. Then when we went to check out another guy came in and wanted our booth and instead of taking our money she went to clean it for him."}
{"text":"I'm a local. A friend of mine and myself went to eat there.  1st they got the order wrong but fixed it. Then when It came to pay the bill. Our waitress over charged my friends credit card by $20 said she refunded the money but had no record of it then tried to charge her $17 in cash on top of that. . I won't be going back there and I will spread the word"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect.  Great food and even better service. Just in town for 1 night or would have gone back for another meal. What a nice surprise"}
{"text":"We have been to this Co Co's several times over the past three yrs and each and everytime it seems to get worse. Our latest visit I had the 55 club country fried steak, not bad, mashed potatoes we so so but my wife ordered the ground beef steak. It was a cheap, really cheap, frozen hamburger thrown on the grill, nasty taste, may have been from freezer burn, but the burgers at any McDonalds, Hardees, or Burger King are one heck of a lot better quality meat. I doubt if we ever darken the door of this place again, I might be old but I still have my taste buds."}
{"text":"Yaeko gave us great service.  Fast, polite and almost guessed our needs before requesting. We'd come here again. The Cinnamin Roll French Toast is always great. This place is next to Hooters, and across the street from MGM parking lot.  You can see the Monorail from CoCo's. One nice thing about CoCo's is they still give you free refills on Orange Juice and Grapefruit Juice.  The other breakfast guys don't.  Why give me free refills for Soda at a place that serves breakfast 24/7 and charge me for another glass of OJ."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we found this place! My husband and I were tired of getting ripped off for breakfast on our recent Vegas vacation and decided to try Coco's. I had the California omelet which was everything I hold dear in life, avocado, bacon and cheese. The pancakes were super fluffy and the service was 10x better than anywhere else we ate on the strip. A must do if you are looking to stuff your face for breakfast without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Polite and speedy service.  Excellent pancakes.  Great that it's 24 7.  Also nice to escape the strip, cheaper!"}
{"text":"Waitress was nice, gluten free pancake with Carmel was good. They have my hazelnut creamer for my coffee which is a plus. Issues; walls, post, ceiling is a little dirty and also booths were worn and dirty. At the register where they keep the pies, that area needs to be cleaned and wiped down. Place needs an update/ renovation and a total wipe down throughout the place."}
{"text":"Went to my first Cocos in Newport beach, and although not nearly as nice, its good, cheap ( Vegas prices) healthier than fast food ,food for Vegas. Pretty good size portions for two girls, stick with the basics and you'll be happy. It was right across from the MGM, where we stayed at, so once we discovered it was there, ( easy to overlook) we went for a late breakfast the days we were there. Under $30 for the 2 of us with tip, so quite reasonable by Vegas standards, or really anywhere for that matter."}
{"text":"Ordered sirloin steak+shrimp scampi. At $15, the price was appropriate for the food. The steak itself wasn't bad and was cooked to order. The scampi was OK- a bit too much sauce and kind of bland. Unfortunately, the vegetables were steamed to death. At least the service was good and attentive. All-in-all Coco's is an average diner."}
{"text":"Worse place ever,brought my mom to eat for mothers day didn't ask her if she wanted another cup of coffee....serve pass by 5 times didn't even look at our table to see if we needed something.....well never come here again food was to salty....then want to ask if we where going to tip wth.."}

{"text":"What a place. Don't let the location or store front fool you. This place is awesome. Wonderful service (Thank you Javier with the man bun), and the foods is incredibly delicious. You can tell the money is being well spent on good product and good cooks.  Come to this place, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"This spot is located across from the MGM signature I was staying in and my friend and I needed some late night nosh so I looked this place up.  We went in and it's a VERY cozy IHOP type joint.  You can tell it's mom and pop - and at 3am, we had the friendliest, nicest servers I could imagine.  I ordered an omelet that had hash and gouda cheese, my friend ordered a chorizo and egg burrito.  She said hers was the spiciest she'd ever encountered, I could only laugh at her as she was determined to finish it cause she's a 'G' like that.  (code for we're smashed and hungry)  Mama don't do spicy, so I picked the perfect thing, after a lil salt and pepper, I was GOOD - their coffee was even good (Starbucks fanatic here).  I have to say, it's a great choice for getting it in late and the prices are on par with IHOP - not Vegas pricey.  Win for me!"}
{"text":"I am proud to say that I found the best place for brunch in Las Vegas. Do not waste your time on rooting through Yelp!, just go to Coco's for amazing start of your day."}
{"text":"Came to cocos years ago the best coffee in the whole wide world. Being local we stopped in for a delicious breakfast. 100%  good BUT they've changed their coffee so I can only rate the coffee so-so."}
{"text":"We dined here at breakfast time. Seating was immediate and we were greeted by our waiter within a minute.  The menu had plenty of offerings although I only wanted a traditional bacon, eggs and waffle. But I was surprised that in such a busy restaurant my food came hot and not overcooked. Having that certainly made my day.  Our waiter was very attentive and accommodating, regularly refilling our coffee and checking with our meal satisfaction.   I'm glad we stopped at this location and will probably stop here again on our next trip to Vegas. L"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled, Coco's has nothing to do with Ice T's wife.  Now that is out of the way, this is as grease spoon as it gets.  A decent amount of pretty sub-par food for extremely cheap.  We came down on a tight budget due to winning tickets to Vegas unexpectedly.   Since breakfast is the most important meal of the day, we had to find a place to eat.  I seen Coco's when I walked across the street to get a bottle of liquor the previous day.  My wife and I came here expecting cheap, greasy, fast food for cheap, which is exactly what we got.  I remember getting the San Diego Sunrise.  BLUH!! What a shitty mess.  Ground chuck? Is that what you call that?  Chipotle Holindaise.....That was pathetic.  Avacados? Well, hard to mess that one up.  The whole thing overall was a culinary wreck.  The avacados wouldn't even stay on the patty because of the nasty slippery \"holindaise\".  The eggs were fine......I'll admit that, but the patty itself was nasty.  The next day we came here I went for a classic eggs, toast, sausage and pancakes. MUCH BETTER.  There's that basic borring food I was looking for!!!  At least I could eat it and finish it, unlike that nasty stuff from the previous day.   Service was OK.  We had the same waitress both times we came here.  My wife had a really hard time keeping her coffee topped off and I had a hard time keeping water in my glass.  We had to keep waiving down other servers to help us.  In short, it's better than starving.....but not by much."}
{"text":"We stopped here from the Yelp reviews. The place is just off the strip close to Hooters and across from the MGM. It is a decent sized restaurant with parking. We were seated quickly and the waitress was very friendly and attentive. We ordered and food was brought out very quickly. The place was packed and all the food that went past our table looked great. The prices are about average and they do fill your plate with food. Coco's is a great place for any meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for breakfast Tuesday morning. We made it in time to order from their breakfast specials that start $7.99. The breakfast special is good until 11:00 am. I ordered scrambled eggs, fruit, applewood smoked bacon and a croissant. My husband ordered scrambled eggs, pancakes, sausage links and fruit. We added coffee and water for the beverages. Our waiter was friendly, efficient and fast. He quickly brought our coffees and water to the table and took our order. We waited 10 minutes and our food arrived: hot and delicious. We haven't ate at Cocos since 2013. They have definitely improved since then. Their prices are comparable to other chains in the Phoenix metropolitan area. We will return in the future."}
{"text":"GET THE CINNAMON ROLL!!! It's HUGE! It could be your whole meal & it's worth it!!!! Absolutely hands down the best cinnamon roll I've ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN.  Stopped in for a late lunch and there were about 10 cars in the parking lot. We walked in and found two other parties waiting on tables (and there were many available).  Staff walked by, totally ignoring us for about 5 minutes.  Finally we all ended up getting seated.  Then we waited and waited for someone to acknowledge us.  We finally got our drinks and after some time our order.  The food was not good, the service was bad.  The place was old and decrepid.  I can't image ever needing to go back."}
{"text":"Fail.... give this place a -5 hair in the food and the waitress with the slicked back braid smells likes designer IMPOSTSTER perfume and cigarettes! Nasty . Not coming back."}
{"text":"We ate here both mornings we stayed down on the strip. Regular prices and love that there is a gluten free menu! Good service, the food was good. Try the brioche eggs benedict! Yum! Good family restaurant w/o the crazy strip prices."}
{"text":"Great options for the whole family. We are big breakfast people & everyone loved it. The coco' cinnamon roll French toast was to die for! It really was the best version of we have had. The corn beef hash skillet, was a home made jewel( only second to NYC corn beef hash) My hubbie had the lumber jack another great option for the heavy meat eater. We ordered 1 less plate per person and still had way too much for us to eat. Super generous portions. Kids menu was great, mini pancakes & good fresh fruit options. Good service & friendly people."}
{"text":"We stopped here one morning for some breakfast before heading out to Hoover Dam.  Cheap menu - lots of food for your money.  Staff was very friendly!  Highly recommend the cinnamon roll french toast!!  So it was delish!!"}
{"text":"Closest breakfast to the airport and service was slow to start.   I mentioned at the welcome that we needed to expedite our experience.   They said,  \"yes, yes\" but no action was taken.   It was nearly 10 min before our server came.  I ordered steak and eggs medium. One egg was perfect,  the other looked like snot opposed to egg white.   My steak was medium well and lacking flavor.   After the food was delivered they didn't check on us again until the bill came.  Never asked how the food was.  Coffee refills were average.  Staff was polite and smiled."}
{"text":"I happened to take a look here, as I was driving by and Yelp put a notification on my phone re Coco's. Can't believe any reasonable functioning person would give this place 5 stars, 4 stars, 3 stars or 2 stars.  And yes, I've had the unfortunate experience to have eaten there in the past. All this place has going for it, is location, location and location.  Those staying at the nearby Motel 6, American's Best Value Inn, or Howard Johnsons, might be lured there by the convenient location.  Cleanliness not the best, food mediocre to poor.  For gawd sakes, if you are looking to eat, there are SO MANY other places nearby (not on the strip) that are more worthy of your money and dignity and taste buds.  At a minimum go west onTropicana a few blocks to Einstein Bagels, or north on Koval to the cafe at Super 8.    This place is really not worthy of your business, they are just taking advantage of their location and sinking to the lowest common denominator...  My honest opinion..."}
{"text":"Waking up after a loooooong night of partying in Vegas, my friends and I needed greasy food to cure our hangovers. I turned on Yelp, and BAM there's Coco's right down the block from our hotel. I called immediately and they were crazy busy (apparently everyone else was also hungover). It took about 15 minutes for me to place an order to pick up since it was so loud and they had just changed their menu.  15 minutes later, we dig into our well deserved meal. It was perfect. I ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs. The corned beef hash was much better than I expected. It had flavor (although it could've used some hot sauce) and the eggs were poached nicely too. It didn't come with any toast so I ordered a couple of biscuits. They were not good. Avoid if you can. Otherwise, my friends all dug into the pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage and there were zero complaints.  Coco's was reasonably priced and delicious. If I'm in the area again, I wouldn't mind stopping back in for another hungover breakfast cure."}
{"text":"So I love cocos for breakfast in Vegas and would normally just left 4 stars but OMG TAMARA!! She is the BEST server. She is so sweet and so on it! Every time I turned around my coffee was refilled and my water topped off. She is amazing! I didn't want to leave because she was so fun and just really personable. She is one of those people that just brighten your day and make you feel like family. Thank you for such a great experience. We Love Tamara!!"}
{"text":"(Las Vegas) All I can say is $4.99 breakfast special :) Eggs, meat, hash browns, and pancakes. :) They have a large menu with many items. Open 24hrs. Gotta try the Country Fried steak an eggs too. Great bakery too, got cinnamon rolls as big as frisbees.. :)"}
{"text":"Cuco's was the nearest restaurant that was near the inn and was opened at night. My friends and i decided to go there to get a midnight dinner, after the long drive. In the night, Cuco's has some people, but compared to the morning, it's between almost packed to packed. A friend and I decided to share the nachos supreme or something with nachos and the meat on it was good. My friend & I decided to share it because it was almost 1am in the morning. The waiter that served us was the only waiter in the restaurant & he did helped us. I would like to say that this place was good because they have one waiter for the night & their food is not bad."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place off the Vegas strip. Try the cinnamon bun French toast! We visited this place twice during our stay in Vegas. The first time was very late or very early however u look at it. The waitress was great !  I had the corned beef has with the specialty potatoes. It was ok. On my second visit before heading to the airport, it was a Saturday morning and it was packed. Tried the Pacific Scramble it was really tasty."}
{"text":"It's late, you're dog tired and skulking back to the Howard Johnson inn.  But first food is needed.   This isn't anything fancy or amazing like the strip. It's  \"let's eat on the cheap and then go to bed\" food.  The burgers are ok. -try the bacon burger Same with the omelettes - the something Swiss one Avoid the steaks -frozen, under-seared, and chewy I didn't try the pie. But if I did I guess apple would be my goto.  Service was fast and efficient, a short wait it seems if your party is small, and the coffee gets refilled on the fly. My cup never went dry which is service that I like.   For about $20 for two people, it's a fair price for decent food that will make tomorrow's hangover a little more bearable."}
{"text":"Nice place to find gluten free options at reasonable prices... the food options are good and lot of flexibility in the options and works well for vegetarians... Oh and one more thing, this place is open 24/7...  A suggestion to the management: lot of times, Vegas visitors would be in need to charge their phones. If they can help charge phones while we devour your amazing food, it will be very helpful...  I"}
{"text":"Wow!  Absolutely delicious food fabulous staff ... two days in a row and definitely not disappointed.  Excellent value for your dollar.  Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Tropicanna, the hotel we were staying in was within walking distance from Cocos and the ratings were high so I figured I would try it.  Upon walking in I was greeted by a awful smell which was extra strong in the restroom  but I figured a bad smell would not discourage me from eating good food.   The atmosphere reminded me of a old diner from the 60 ' s but it was missing the friendly waitress with the pen behind her ear. Instead our waitress was straight to the point not rude but not at all big on conversation.  If I could rate the menu alone I would give it 5 stars everything looked delicious and the descriptions made you think you couldn't go wrong with any of the menu items.   I decided on the mouth watering charbroiled Turkey burger. The burger was a frozen turkey patty and the bread was supposed to be wheat but looked like a regular bun fresh toppings though.  The fries were very thin and not bad but not good either. My friend had the pancakes which she said was ok. The turkey bacon was cooked perfectly I was told.   If you are looking for a cheap breakfast and Dennys is too far of a walk for you this might be your best bet."}
{"text":"Understaffed on a Saturday. First time customer and will never go back. Terrible service, unbussed tables, filthy carpet. This restaurant is in Sun City Grand so I would expect much better"}
{"text":"Great place to eat for breakfast! It's off the strip so prices are cheaper! The portion sizes are larger & the service is outstanding! It's a nice family style restaurant serving breakfast, lunch & dinner. They also have homemade desserts. Located right behind Tropicana & MGM!"}
{"text":"The bad reviews totally throw me off! I went with a group of 4 others at 10pm last night and  it was fabulous! We were the only ones besides workers there, and got seated right away. 4/5 of us got the special - any burger + 1 side + a slice of any pie for $8.99! All of our orders were right and cooked just the way each of us wanted them. Our waitor and one of the cooks in the back were very attentive and kept making sure everything was tasty without being annoying and pesty like some waitors are. I'm a picky person, and don't just handout good reviews to any business. This place really was great! We plan to go back in the near future, and I'll definitely update if my opinion has changed!"}
{"text":"Looking for a cheap and good breakfast place?  Love this neighborhood Coco's.  Never too busy and food is always hot and fast.  Bacon crispy and pancakes are light and flavorful.  Less than 10 bucks, no wait, and good eats near my house.  No hipsters is a huge plus."}
{"text":"There was a gnat in my water, and the waiter tried to tell us he \"lost\" our debit card, but they do have pumpkin pancakes that will send your pancreas into spasms. Your coronary arteries, too.   What the hell. Pumpkin goodness only comes once a year."}
{"text":"Been to this location multiple times. Food is always good. Waitress went out of her way to make my party happy and was really kind. Only problem was it seemed kind of hot in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Javier best server we have had in a long time. Restaurant was jam packed.  Super friendly and polite. We would recommend this restaurant to all.  Wow we just got our food!!! 7 minutes. Thanks Cocos."}
{"text":"This place is amazing everyone here is very nice and attentive it's actually a great place to spend with the family. I would recommend the salmón is fenómeno and I would like to thank All the staff they do a good job."}
{"text":"Came here off a whim trying to find a place to eat at 2am. They have great food and the nicest staff. From the host to the waitress, everything was perfect. The food is good too! Also, the prices are more than reasonable. My girlfriend and I liked it so much that we came here again for a late lunch prior to us leaving Vegas. If you want a chill and relaxed spot with great food and service, come here!"}
{"text":"Sold 3-stars.  It's Coco's, not some buffet on the Strip but it's right next door to the Motel 6 where I was staying, so there's that.  Coffee, hash and eggs and a wait a couple hours before an eight-mile obstacle race.  Not the best way to prepare, but at least I wasn't starving on the course."}
{"text":"Pies are abundant and the service is friendly and patient. The peaches are amazing right now!  Peach tea, pie, pancakes, French toast, crepes, lemonade, etc. It is mostly SCG residents, so it's not too busy usually  and the view of the golf course is a nice treat in the desert. They have indoor and patio seating."}
{"text":"Reading some of the other reviews, I can only imagine that this place has its good days and it's not so good days.  We went on one of the good days. Seated quickly, served quickly, food order was correct and delicious and we signed up for their e-club thing also.  Cannot find anything to complain about! Sorry!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty amazed at the service and the food. Better than other 24 hour restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We went to Coco's in Sun City Grand last with a group of our Corvette friends. We couldn't have received any better service.  The waitress was right their and willing to get anything we needed.  The manager and her assistant made feel ever welcome. We will be back."}
{"text":"Corned beef hash was excellent. Pancakes were good. Good service. Sweet soul music playing in the background. Clean bathrooms. Very nice place off the strip to go eat breakfast. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Better than Denny's.... Super amazing burger and real mashed potatoes and gravy from scratch.... Fresh zucchini.... Delicious meal! Eat here! Don't get the ribs BTW.... Inside source says.... Ewwww lol"}
{"text":"Great service. Diner food with a wide selection. And best of all an escape from overpriced casino restaurants. This place was a life saver during our visit."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast in Las Vegas. Very reasonably priced and tasty food. Higher quality than a Denny's and about the same price, but portions on the slightly small size. Service was fine, and the environment was comfortable but could use a bit more attention to detail on the general cleanliness (nothing horrible). Conveniently located off of Tropicana. I had the raspberry pancakes and they were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Omg great service good food.  Its been awhile since I've eaten at a Coco   Mom and I were here yesterday and again great service. So I brought my boyfriend today and again great service and food.  There cheesecake with peaches on top is the best.  We'll be back soon there peach feast ends on the 31.  Also the manager I've notice talks to the customers he'll seat you and bring you your drinks.  Again great service and food."}
{"text":"Good old time food stop today breakfast. Having eggs, sausage and biscuits. Very excellent everything. Biscuits seem handmade too. Will surely return. A surprising best of here. My opinion."}
{"text":"I went on a vacation recently with friends to Las Vegas.  For most of us, it was our first time there.  We stayed at a hotel right by the Hooter's Casino, and had to find a place for breakfast our first day since our hotel did not offer any.  A short 5 minute walk later, we found Coco's.  Best value for all the food we got.  $6 for two eggs, bacon, hash browns and pancakes??  SOLD.  We all loved it so much, we went the next 3 days in a row for breakfast!  We even joked how even though we were on vacation, we felt like \"regulars\" there.  The service was quick, never waited more than a couple minutes for a table (and there were 6 of us), and everyone there was very nice and friendly.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because their bathrooms were pretty dirty.  Other than that, I must say, when I go back to visit Vegas again in the future, Coco's will be a MUST!"}
{"text":"My wife and I sat on the outside patio which had heaters and great views. The waitress was busy but once she took our order the food came out very fast. The price is very reasonable and the food was delicious. The menu is very big so we will be back to try different items."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend  went here and the staff  was friendly the service was great. Even the inside looked comfortable just I ordered the salmon and it was dry the potatoes were over salted and the chef wouldn't keep his eyes off my girlfriend and to top it off it smelled like rotten eggs.... but all and all I did like the staff...well some of them... and the interior and exterior were great just the food not so good."}
{"text":"great prices for food near the Strip.  kinda divey customers, but food was good.  agree, the no charge refills on OJ is nice when soda is not wanted.    just order what they do well - the non-breakfast is just OK.  read the reviews."}
{"text":"Probably the best place to eat for breakfast in Las Vegas.  You get more for your money.  It was only a 5 minute walk from MGM.  And it's worth the walk. We could have ate at the hotel but the reviews and the price for breakfast is outrageous.  We were seated quickly and our waitress Gloria G was very good and attentive.  She actually told us what to get for a better deal and that comes a long way when your in Las Vegas.  The coffee was really good there too.  I recommend this place for breakfast.  I would have gave it 5 stars but it was really warm in cocos but if you can deal with that then it's worth a visit"}
{"text":"Donna is an absolute doll. Makes us feel like family and is very attentive.  We love the place simply because of her wonderful personality"}
{"text":"Really liked this place. My server was really nice and the food was great..ill be back.."}
{"text":"Coco is one of my favorites for two reasons. They have a really nice waitstaff and they're gluten-free pancakes are amazing! They have lots of seating in the food comes really quickly. It's my go to for Saturday morning breakfast with my kids."}
{"text":"We r new to towne and have found v few dessert places around  Saw Cocos on yelp and had never been. The pie is like SO deadly we've been coming in buying full pies like once a week lol. Adam is the coolest dude, he convinced me to get peach cheesecake and I've never looked back"}
{"text":"Great delicious cheap food! Yum yum!!! Breakfast combos are very good value. Friendly staff and fast service. Their restroom smells pretty bad though. But everything else is good."}
{"text":"A greasy spoon. Cheese in omelet was like plastic and tasteless. Everything was greasy and oily. The 2 stars are there for a lovely attentive waitress"}
{"text":"You have to love finding relatively cheap eats around the Vegas strip area. This place is comparable to a Denny's restaurant but with a sweet twist. They have an old lady that comes in and make desserts for them daily. These desserts seem to win Awards at various functions, so they are supposedly very good.   After many rain delays and finally making it to Vegas, I was hungry, and this place is 20 feet away from my Hotel. I went in and automatically realize that they were a Denny's style place.  You know I took the time to look at all of the deserts in the display case with the accompanied awards won for the dish. I asked what the specials were and we're giving three different specials. The staff was really nice and actually gave me the pros and cons of each special. I was told that they were known for the breakfast and their burgers, but the burger that was on special was really small. Of course I went with the breakfast special that was essentially $7 for 2 eggs, 2 sausages or bacon, 2 pancakes, and choice of country potatoes or hash browns.   It was a lot of food and a great value. All in all, it was decent eating at a great price. The pancakes had great texture and was very big. Overall the breakfast was decent, but nothing to write home about. I can't give them more than three stars until I try their desserts. I saw that they had a homemade banana cream pie for $8 for the entire pie, but didn't wish to eat an entire pie by myself...that night!  All in all, if you want decent food at a great price, this place is a great find right off the Las Vegas Strip.  Be warned, some people may not like the surrounding area at night!  I did see a bum sleeping behind the building in the shade."}
{"text":"Hey people Im from Denmark and had been at cocos on my holiday trip to the US. They are just fantasic The food and the service were just perfect :) :)"}
{"text":"Our breakfast was amazing..The Omellette and Hash Browns were perfect and not greasy..good portions.... they were quick and friendly...exactly what you want in a breakfast...:)"}
{"text":"Wana get away from the craziness? This is the place.  Clean quite and friendly.  Great food and nice staff."}
{"text":"Love their pies, you can order them online. The cheese pies are the best!"}
{"text":"Good food, great prices, and the friendliest service you could ask for. If you want to step away from the glitz and glam of the strip then this is a great spot that's reminiscent of a good old fashioned diner."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and clean.  We stayed at the MGM and walked there every morning for breakfast.  Great 4.99 breakfast special!"}
{"text":"BEWARE: Came in and ordered a pie for take out for a bday party...paid, left a small tip, signed my cc receipt and left. Two days later my card was charged for a different amount than authorized....thank goodness I had my receipt to call their management as proof. Whether or not it was just a random error, that sort of thing really should never happen in this day and age...it's illegal to charge a cc for something other than the authorized signed amount! Not saying don't eat here, food was fine, but I'd definitely hold on to your receipts and remember your server's name as they don't have their ducks in a row."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast back in March 2016 and the food was terrible.  As I waited for my food I saw a couple just get up and leave.  Their plates looked like they hardly touched them.  Thought nothing of it everyone else was still eating looked like a busy place.  I got my pancakes they looked great took a few bites and the middles of each one was uncooked.  Wife started looking hers over and there was a black curly hair on a piece of melon that came with here meal.  This was our experience.  Went in looking for some breakfast came out grossed out.  I cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place always runs out of items on the menu. I've ordered the chicken fried steak twice and it never comes with the fresh bread they advertise. In this visit alone I've heard the waitress tell two tables they didn't have baked potatoe or a breakfast item. Our waitress appeared lithargic and took a long cigarette break while all her tables waited on her and the cook. It was bad enough she didn't check up on her guest often enough. The team leader is no better. She's helped us twice before. Never smiles. its enough to make someone depressed. Luckly the food they have is great on an empty stomach. Love the unlimited hot coco. Avoid the water. Tastes like algee."}
{"text":"this place is a disaster, dirty carpets, tables and chairs deteriorated, the food is regular, waitresses are friendly and very attentive is the only good thing."}
{"text":"This restaurant is close enough to the strip to walk to get a good breakfast, yet far enough that there isn't a wait and prices are good. I've only been here for breakfast, but I tend to eat here on every trip to Vegas. Service is usually good the food is standard American fare. The coffee is organic, which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast!! Amazing coffee with French vanilla!! The new setting looks pretty fancy and clean! The view is pleasurable!  We will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"If I can give a 1/2 star or less I would. Please do not come in here. Food are terrible. I ordered a  sirloin steak with bake potatoes and steam veg. No taste at all. Bake potatoes was cold, steak was no taste.  Strings onion is broken into little pieces and potatoes soup is not good either. Oh the best part is my diet Pepsi and crackers."}
{"text":"Place was a dump. Bathrooms gross. They are due for some major remodel. The restaurant smelled like air fresheners instead of food. Not good when they try to cover up a funky smell. Food was...well food. Nothing great about it, but I guess it filled me up. Service was great though. Friendly staff. An extra star for them trying hard."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this restaurant. Honestly had the best burger ever! Had a prime rib burger with bacon. A must have if you like burgers. The service was great as well. Plus it wasn't too busy for a Friday night.  The pie for dessert was delicious as well. Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My mother worked for Coco's in California for 16 years and my twin sister and I have very fond memories of eating (and doing our homework) there. Now that I'm an adult and have a family of my own, I decided to take my little family to Coco's for breakfast.   For starters, this particular location had 2 waiters for a Saturday morning... Obviously this caused the service to be a little slow, but the food was delicious! I'm not sure if I have ever finished my whole plate of breakfast in a restaurant, but that statement is no longer true, because I killed that \"Lumberjack Breakfast\" and my family did the same with their meals!  Overall, the service could've been more prompt but everything else was A-Ok!"}
{"text":"Got a 12 Oz prime rib for lunch and flavor wise it was meh it arrived cold needed salt and 1/4 of my steak was just a chunk of fat took a nice photo, not a fan."}
{"text":"Close to my house so we go often buttt they have a seafood shepherds pie omg aaaawwwweeesone"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this, but the food tastes horrible at this place. We had 3 different breakfast dishes and all of them were of poor quality. The orange juice was from concentrate, the hash brownies had way to much wheat, the sauce was just greasy and the meat tasted rewarmed. Sorry, but one star is the best I can do."}
{"text":"My server was great!    Ample parking.   Food was OK. Nothing special.   Place could use some updating but my table was clean and I didn't have any problems with dirt.   Came on Monday morning so maybe why I had a nice experience.   I would come back."}
{"text":"Very good food, wait staff very so so.  I agree with other reviews that they have there good and bad.  We were 5 adults there at 10:50 am on Sunday.  We waited about 30 min to be seated, would take either the patio seating or inside.  Finally they seated us on the patio.  The waitress was there took orders then it was another 45 min wait for the food.    There was another large table that was seated after us and they got there food before we got ours.  I don't believe we ordered anything complicated usual breakfast fair.    The food, however, was awesome, so we were happy with that.  At one time one of the cooks was on the patio looking at the TV NASCAR races Instead of cooking.    I think the manager should be more concerned with seeing to it the kitchen can get the food out on a more timely basis.  We live in The small community, Sun City Grand and really want to see the restaurant  survive."}
{"text":"Food, price, service was good. It was very busy when we arrived but we're still seated promptly and served quickly. Food was good except for the fact that their Mushroom&Swiss Omelette should of been called their Onion Omelette... way too many chunks of onion. Otherwise, their classic breakfasts were good. Expect better then Denny's that's for sure."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday to grab breakfast while on a weekend trip to Vegas. I like finding less touristy options and this west coast chain was situated off the strip so it wasn't super crowded. I had the fresh bananas and oatmeal while my boyfriend had the lumberjack breakfast. We also split a piece of coffee cake. I was disappointed in the coffee cake. It seemed too dry and had a funky taste. I'm not sure if it was over baked or was missing an ingredient. It was just different. All in all this was a good breakfast location."}
{"text":"I must admit that I was a little skeptical because there were so many bad reviews. But thanks to the reviews I figured I might be safe if I just stick to ordering breakfast. I came with a group of friends that were raving about the breakfast food.   When I walked in I was initially turned off because the restaurant was old, didnt smell the greatest, and looked like it was in desperate need of restoration.   The waiter came to the table to take our orders, he was very nice.  As I looked over the breakfast menu I was overwhelmed by all of the tasty options they had to choose from-it was very hard to decide.   I landed on the banana, walnut, and caramel pancakes with eggs.  These pancakes were TO DIE FOR. It was so good that despite being full I was still eating. The pancakes alone get 5 stars from me.  Unfortunately the eggs weren't good. I had to add lots of salt and pepper to get them to a decent taste. And I noticed everyone else at the table adding salt to their eggs.   Overall the food was good. And I was very pleased. The restaurant itself could use a serious facelift."}
{"text":"Update: Susan asked me to email Omata which I did but received no response. LOL.  This week I went to Coco's for two take-out pieces Coconut Cream pie.......delicious. Later for dessert we discovered that we received  Banana Cream pie. LOL."}
{"text":"Was seated right away. Flowing traffic, but very roomy. Was served as soon as we sat down, quick service and very attentive. Food a tad bit slower than any breakfast restaurant. But I won't complain when it comes to food. Chorizo hash is amazing. The pancakes are even better I didn't have to use syrup. The bitter topping is good. Pretty good to a value breakfast. Got the bill and was way lower than I expected.. I had to double check to make sure I was chartered for all that I order. $25 for two breakfast platter coffee Ana a side of hash and couldn't finish it all.."}
{"text":"So to start out, I liked our waitress. I started out with soup. BY FAR the best tomato soup Ive had. But my meal was just ok, and my boyfriend wasnt impressed with his either. Unfortunately I probably wont go there JUST for the soup"}
{"text":"I have only had breakfast here but it was really good.  I was very impressed with the service, promptly seated, quick with the coffee and refills, and the food was served piping hot.  They have a nice variety of omelets on the menu so that's what we went for.  I had the Mediterranean and my mom had the senior cheese one.  Both were cooked perfectly, my was very tasty with kalmata olives, spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  My mom said she loved that they used sharp cheddar in hers not bland American cheese like most restaurants use.  I don't know about other Coco's in the valley but this one is great."}
{"text":"After eating out for many days you will still find something tasty for breakfast or brunch at this place. The food is great. The prices are good, too, especially for being Las Vegas. The interior is dated like other people point out but that's an OK sacrifice in my eyes."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, the staff is friendly and eager to please, under the direction of a lady willing to go the extra mile to give TRUE customer service. I have found an official Las Vegas  staple that I will recommend to all my friends. Come, eat, enjoy!"}
{"text":"This will be one of our top choices for Sunday breakfast when we come to Vegas. Much better service and quality than the IHOP down the street where we had an awful experience. Yaeko and staff were attentive and kept our drinks full."}
{"text":"Ran in for a quick breakfast being it was right across the street from where I was staying....was seated immediately once I sat down you can see just how dated this place is,wood trim on tables was gone roof had stains from roof/ac leaks I was thinking twice on ordering,but I did steak being it said never frozen always fresh that's was wrong it was over cooked and had no flavor I didn't take any pictures it was just bad.i will NOT be coming here in the future nor do I recommend this place.as for the server his name was Javier and he was great I had nothing bad to say about him other than he did his job and was polite."}
{"text":"Food was eh... it was okay. Not disgusting, but not what I would call \"good.\" I would give food a 1.5/5. Prices were maybe on-par to Denny's or Ihop.  The service we received was a total hit and miss. The first waitress was EXTREMELY horrible, but very entertaining when we heard her yelling and screaming at her coworkers in the back and kitchen area. It was very unprofessional, but very funny at the same time. To add on to that experience, there was a table next to ours and the customer (sweet old lady) told the our waitress she forget her salad... and the waitress was very snappy and told her she was lying and that she already received it. The customer got very upset. So, the waitress leaves and goes to the kitchen, and BEHOLD, the salad was there. The waitress was just very unprofessional and didn't handle it correctly. I felt really bad for the customer.  Since that waitress was too busy proving everyone that she \"knows everything,\" a different waiter helped us complete our order and helped us throughout our meal. He was what made our experience better.  The atmosphere felt really old, and not comfortable.   Same your time and money, and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews on yelp and decided to try this place out since it was really close by to where I was staying.  I got the 12oz prime rib medium and was pretty disappointed because it was over cooked.  There's a huge difference between medium and over cooking it. Nevertheless the bake potatoes was not bad and the server was nice."}
{"text":"- Huge portions - unlimited coffee - 24 hours"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, but tasty food. Worn down and delightfully tacky decor. I ordered the chorizo hash with grain and nut pancakes. The cakes were fluffy, fresh, with a variety of nuts. The spicy hash was the perfect co-star. My husband's steak and eggs wee a bit disappointing. He needed steak sauce to enjoy his well-done sirloin. Service was pleasant,  but a little delayed."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is not good.  Maybe they are short of staff but management should have a grip on getting customers waited on and served faster than 45 minutes"}
{"text":"First time coming to a Coco's and wasn't sure what to expect, but I had just had a long day on the Vegas Strip and was hungry. Had checked this place out on Yelp and it had a lot of great reviews and since it was right beside where I was staying, I decided to drop in.   This location is older, possibly in the original state since they built it. It looks old inside and out, but not disgustingly old.   I was seated immediately and my waitress came fairly quickly to take drink orders. I think there were only 2 waitresses at 8 pm and there were lots of people at tables. With that said, our food came out within 10 minutes and was hot, fresh tasting, and the portion was huge. Probably could've shared mine as I hardly was able to finish 1/2 of my food. I ordered the San Francisco Sourdough burger which came with fries. It was so good! The burger was well cooked and was perfectly paired with sourdough bread, which is my favorite. The burger came with a huge pile of crispy fries.   My waitress came around several times to make sure everything was good and to refill drinks. She was nice enough, just seemed really busy with all the tables that she was taking care of. The guy at the register was super friendly with a very bubbly personality and he was very  accommodating."}
{"text":"Upon walking in I was overcome with the smell of septic ( which seems to be common around Vegas). The decor is very 80s and I am pretty sure that was the last time it was deeply cleaned.  The service: the older gal that brought our drinks was grumpy and carried them out on a tray with a rag sitting on it, which was a turn off. The waiter made up for it though. He was friendly and attentive.  The food: My husband and I both ordered the basil egg white omelette ( I got the fruit as a side and my husband the hashbrowns). It was very bland despite having onion, tomato, spinach and feta. There was no basil taste what so ever and was greasy. The fruit was good though.  Our children ordered the banana walnut pancakes. They enjoyed them a lot. My son,who loves sausage, didn't eat it and said it taste gross and was too greasy  Over all 50% of our family was fairly satisfied. I won't be back any time soon though."}
{"text":"The gluten free options were a little more limited than I thought they'd be based on reviews.  It's more like a normal restaurant where you order things w/o the bun.  They do have gluten free pancakes that the kids inhaled.   My GF egg-free child got hashbrowns and plain grilled chicken but the kitchen ignored our request for no pepper and were very heavy handed with fresh cracked pepper.   The server was very helpful and knowledgeable about the food.   3 days in Vegas and it's the only resturany the kids want to go back too."}
{"text":"We had brunch here as a group of 7.  Service we speedy and friendly.  Their  bakery items we delicious.  We tried the cinnamon rolls(they are gigantic)& the muffins.  We ordered a variety of omlets? and pancakes, all were spectacular.  My personal favorite was the raspberry stuffed pancakes.  My daughter loved her Dutch apple as well.  More of a personal taste preference.  Very inexpensive for such great quality."}
{"text":"Food is good. Portions are good and location is easy to get in and out of. Never too busy and they hire good staff. Clean and traditional. Chains like these are getting rare. They beat the pants off any Denny's with their menu and cooking."}
{"text":"i love their $6.99 pie sale and love that they are introducing new healthy salad options.  their prime rib is not bad!"}
{"text":"Coco's was an extremely convenient breakfast stop with good food. It is diner style very much like Denny's, IHOP, Waffle House, etc. Service was fast, coffee was always filled, food was great. We ended up coming here for breakfast multiple times during our trip. It's not the most glamorous restaurant, but it's a solid choice for a good, fast, sit down breakfast."}
{"text":"To each his own, but I'll take Coco's over IHOP any day.  And this one was excellent.  Off the strip, parking is easy.  Service was very good.  Got me an omelette, very good.  But the best part was the blueberry muffin on the side.  Warm, excellent taste.  So good. What a great alternative to the massively overpriced meals on the strip.  Try this place, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"We arrived at about noon on Wednesday. We were seated rather quickly, but waited awhile for service. The service was slow and a little out of it. The food was decent, so that helped their stars."}
{"text":"I have to eat a gluten-free diet for health reasons, so when I discovered that Coco's has delicious gluten-free pancakes (which can be included as a side in breakfast meals at no extra cost), this instantly became an favorite dining spot. Unfortunately, they are often out of gluten-free pancakes when I eat there, which is frustrating because that's the main reason I eat there. I usually order an omelette at Coco's, and all the ones I've ever tried have been incredible. They have a fairly long list of gluten-free menu items, so it's a good option if you are gluten-sensitive.  On one of my visits, I had an uncomfortable experience with a waiter, who was behaving flirtatiously. This didn't stop me from coming back (although I never came back alone again), and it was a one-time thing."}
{"text":"Food was OK. meat was not well done. The staff was very polite. Interior is OK not great."}
{"text":"This is now my go-to restaurant for breakfast when staying within walking distance (and that includes the Tropicana, the MGM, and other hotels near them).  Two hot breakfasts to order, including one Lumberjack special, and the tab was $23.  Good service, no wait on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"This place smells like raw sewage when you walk in. I thought it was just the doorway but the whole place stunk. Bad. Ask what the smell was and they said it was the roof??? WTF....Gross had to leave. Health department needs to investigate."}
{"text":"Outstanding place!   Breakfast was amazing and the cinnamon roll was the best I've ever had.  Staff was so friendly!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and all the other times it was good until today. I had biscuits and gravy and the prime rib hash. both were disgusting. Good thing they had Tabasco sauce. otherwise I wouldn't' have been able to eat it."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I have had. I had the cinnamon roll French toast and it was amazing. The service was fantastic and my family and I all enjoyed our food. I would highly recommend this place if you are on the strip and looking for a great breakfast. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Place is great. Lots of good food items to choose from,great service and good quality food for the price you pay. It's a little off the Strip but worth walking a block or two to get there. A notch up from dennys and for a chain is decent :)"}
{"text":"You know, the food was okay overall but my first 15 minutes here was painful.  There was a massive line-up upon walking in the door and no one to take our names and seat us.  After a long period of confusion, we realized that half of the line-up was for people trying to pay their bill.  I had to use Assertive Crystal and get us seated before I pulled my hair out.  Apparently Assertive Crystal scared the befuddled hostess and made a few waiting patrons angry, as I suspect we were seated too early.  Oops.  None of this should have happened.  Clearly the current staff are not cut out for this madness.  I had a very plain breakfast and somehow the toast wasn't good.  They put way too much butter in the center and the crust was a bit too hard and dry.  I didn't think you could screw up toast but it was the first time ever that I wasn't happy with it.  Everything else was acceptable and my spouse enjoyed his omelet.  His glass of orange juice was massive.  I thought the atmosphere and decor was a little weird.  They were prepared to celebrate Easter but it looked like the entire restaurant was decorated by a Kindergarten class.  Maybe it actually was.  We ate here because it was convenient and I'd only go back if that were the case again."}
{"text":"Great affordable breakfast. I went here the other morning with my family. We was seated quickly can the service was great. The only thing I have to complain abut was the desert menu that was on the table was extremely sticky. I would defiantly return, great spot right off the strip."}
{"text":"Our hotel was right by Coco's and we ate there every morning. The food was great and affordable, which is a nice break in Vegas.   If Javier is working when you visit see if you can sit in his section. We had lots of waiters, but he was awesome!   They also always make sure that your drinks are full. My coffee was never less than halfway full. They also have regular creamer and French vanilla crwamer. Nice to have options.   Everything that we ate was delicious. I suggest trying the whole wheat nut pancakes. They are delicious and not always at the top of people's list. They also give you A LOT of food. You won't leave hungry, guaranteed!   Overall, it feels like a breakfast place from home. The people are great.  The food is great. The cost is great. The location is great.  Also, I saw some reviews that said they had a \"B\" rating from the health board. When I visited it was an \"A\". (November 2013).   Eat here!"}
{"text":"The place is dirty and servers are rude, remember what is in photo is not what you will get, the pictures are a lie.  Dodd is gross, servers do not care"}
{"text":"Love the Coco's breakfast. A short walk off the Strip. The place needs a deep clean and paint job, but it's a good sized place, the service is excellent and the food is very good."}
{"text":"I love the food here but the counter girls have a bad actitud it seem to me that they don't like there job it's makes me think twice about going back it's not the first time they act like that"}
{"text":"Rather than start a binge fest marathon my friend and I decided to call it an early night one Saturday. It was 10:15pm, we were starving and really just looking for the closest place to eat that had a bathroom when alas, we found Coco's!   It was old and outdated. Bathroom had a funky smell. However, the service was quick and our host/waiter was nice. The food was good! I had the Chicken & Avocado rolls and loved them. Kudos!  I don't wake up in the morning and crave Coco's, but if i'm ever meandering down the streets of downtown Phoenix again and find myself looking for sustenance, I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Terrific views of the golf course, great menu and wonderful staff! The manager seated us immediately and took ours and several other tables orders. She seemed to work so much harder than the actual servers.  Great job Tree! Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"There are quite a few reviews of Coco's in Vegas, but this Coco's in particular I could not find. This little place right across from the MGM is a little secret. I came here Christmas morning and was warmly greeted at the door by the manager. He walked me to our table, taking note of my party and specially assigning the largest and most private table for us. Immediately after I sat down, before I could even get comfortable, there was a very happy bubbly staff member who came to greet us as well. Afterwards, I probably don't really know who my server was because there were a total of 3 who greeted us and periodically came and checked on us to see if we needed anything additional to our order, but my review for this particular Coco's is about their excellent customer service, warm tradition to coco's standard trained staff and of course their food. Their hash potatoes was excellent and warm. Infact the server brought it out saying \"some of yours was already done and the rest weren't, but I didn't want it to sit there and get cold so I'm bringing you these first, is that ok?\" so she brought it out first. That is SMART and absolutely considerate! When all our food arrived, we enjoyed a good hearty meal.   The host also sat us down with recommendations, for what taste the best and what was best priced. I think this Coco's and this staff is worth my review, and a stop for anyone who doesn't really feel like some more cold/warm buffet and who want some hot food (just make sure you let them know you want it when it comes off the stove)."}
{"text":"One of the few eatery's not integrated into one of the big hotels. Food is of decent quality and taste , portions large. Service is ok and timely. Dining room and rest rooms have potential for an update.  Value for money ok."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck I walking distance from the MGM Grand. Really good diner food."}
{"text":"I use to like coco's. Unfortunately this location is getting worst. 40 min to get your order. This place needs a big remodeling . Food is good just the environment is different to what it used to be"}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away by the quality of the food at Coco's, but it still holds a certain charm.  The waitress was in her 50's, had big hair, and called me 'honey' in her low smoker's voice; the decor was multitudinous -- flowers, knick-knacks, and pictures covered every surface in an effort to draw attention away from the fact that the building itself was in a sad state of disrepair;  I felt like I could have been anywhere in time.  It was late, and we were hungry.  I ordered chicken fingers with french fries.  The fingers were more breading than chicken and obviously came from a bag in a freezer, and the fries weren't very good either.  Liberal amounts of ranch dressing helped out.  My friend's Southwest scramble was a little weird too, and came topped with Asian fried noodles.  Whatever.  It was quick and easy.  We probably won't go back, but it wasn't a bad experience."}
{"text":"Holy omelette heaven! My friend and I came here for a post-hike meal and were seated right away. I had an omelette with avocado and bacon (the Californian I think?) which was so good. It came with potatoes and a banana nut muffin. Potatoes were tasty but the muffin was on the bland side. Service was good and I like how they put what the amount would be if you split the check on the receipt."}
{"text":"So I found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out. The place looked pretty old and run down but I decided to stay and try it out anyways. I ordered the lumberjack breakfast and it was pretty good. The food came out hot and freshly cooked. The portion was big and it was a filling meal. The orange juice wasn't so great but the food was good. The service is very slow here so if you're looking for a perky group of servers then this is not the place. If you're looking for good food then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible service!  Couldn't even order food, barely able to order drinks and that didn't even come out right, my kids hot cocos didn't even come with whip cream even after the kids asked for some.  Wasn't even busy today!"}
{"text":"Our plane landed at Vegas at 1 am and we were positively starving. We decided to check out Coco's since it was open 24/7. First of all, you can get food from both the breakfast and the lunch menus, which was nice since 2 am is kinda in between the two. Second, both menus had healthy options low in calories and sodium, which is great in a city famous for excess. The service was great and personable, and all food was cooked exactly to our preference. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because it's quite grimy and depressing inside. But otherwise it's a great option for unpretentious, affordable food."}
{"text":"Great food and great service Luis I was there on Wednesday morning for break fast my omelet was fenomenal and the cinn roll French toast was to die for. Luis was very helpful and efficient.thank you Coco's !!!!"}
{"text":"Had the egg white omelette with spinach and tomato basil while visiting Vegas. Had it again two days later. Delicious. And the service was great!  Bathroom needs a little attention and updating. Small but cozy and diner like. Great break from all the hustle and bustle. Will return!"}
{"text":"Great service by Luis  I really enjoy my breakfastst !!!!!!"}
{"text":"we were looking for a place to eat breakfast close to our hotel. this diner happened to be right next to the howard johnson we were staying at. we ended up going here for breakfast twice because it was quick, cheap, and tasty. fair warning, weekend brunch hours are packed."}
{"text":"Perfectly executed breakfast. Ordered eggs scrambled easy and I received eggs expertly scrambled easy. There was a nice selection of fresh fruit on the plate. My crispy bacon and two pancakes were hot and tasty. The bill was $5.72. Donna, my server, was no nonsense, kind and professional. All the elements of an enjoyable meal and great value."}
{"text":"I've been trying to call to order my pies for 2 days now and no one answers.  They have really good pies, but the service is always...always...always inconsistent.  I'm at work and don't have time for this.  Gurrrrrr!  Somebody answer the PHONE!!!"}
{"text":"Coco's is a regular stop for my husband and me. We stopped on Friday afternoon at about 3:15 and I was complaining about being too early for the prime rib they only serve on weekends. Low and behold, they are having a special that included prime rib as one of the specials available. 2 entrees,  dinner bread and 1 piece of pie for $30. Prime rib comes with choice of potato and a nice serving of mixed vegetables so one piece of pie is plenty for two people to share. So the manager points out the special and I say, isn't it too early for the prime rib?  He said \"ohhhh no because I know it's done now\". I love that kind of flexibility! Talk about a really good 8 oz piece of prime rib!! You'd pay much more at Black Angus or someplace like that but Coco's prime rib is delicious, a generous portion and economically priced!  Even when the prime rib is regularly priced it's only $17.99 for an 8 oz cut with all the fixings!"}
{"text":"Nice location and the food was good.  Service was initially quick but quickly things went south when the restaurant filled with people.  I think we may have been forgotten when we came here but they seemed to have been short staffed.  I don't totally blame the staff, but simple requests were quickly forgotten and 20 minutes later we were making the same request again.  Perhaps they should hire more people -- otherwise id recommend this location."}
{"text":"Love that they have gluten free options! Prices are very reasonable and the food came out SUPER fast! Our waitress was friendly and very attentive. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Food/Taste: A I ordered the Classic Breakfast Combos with two eggs (scrambled), hash browns, 4 strips of applewood smoked bacon and 2 freshly-made buttermilk pancakes.  The only thing left on my plate was a little bit of hash brown. Everything was flavorful and tasted right on point!  There was a little too much fat on the bacon but I just ate around it.   Order Accuracy: A Everything came out as ordered.   Selection: A They have a very vast variety of dishes - breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, kids menu and more!   Service: A The waitress that was taking care of us was very attentive.  Drinks stayed filled and she was around just the perfect amount to be attentive but not annoying.   Price: A For the taste of the food and the service - right on point!  For reference it's like iHop or Denny's pricing if not a hairline cheaper."}
{"text":"Coco's was suggested to us by an employee at the Tropicana since my husband and I wanted a sit down tasty breakfast. We walked over there and enjoyed some delicious breakfast food that was priced decently for the Vegas area. I ordered the Belgium waffle with peaches and blueberries on top (fresh of course!!!). My waffle came with 2 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon. My husband ordered a delicious all meat omelet with eggs and 2 pancakes on the side. The meal with two coffees was under $25. Make sure you don't judge this place by it's location!!! We almost made that mistake because we saw it sits in front of a crappy motel."}
{"text":"Coco's always delivers!!! Here and at home you can count on a good selection, consistency and pie! My favorites are their cream of broccoli soup, tomato bisque and chocolate silk pie. We stopped there tonight after the Rock & Roll marathon. Many fellow racers were there! Got the tomato bisque tonight. Perfect on a cold, windy, rainy night. Comfort food like grandma used to make."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant twice during my vacation in Las Vegas.  The first time I went it was after midnight and I had the Cinnamon Roll French Toast ($7.89).  It was absolutely delicious and a huge portion for the price.  Our server Donna was very friendly and pleasant.  The atmosphere was welcoming and pleasant to dine in.  Everything came out as ordered and quickly.   The restaurant was so good that we had to return on the morning of our last day in Vegas before our flight.  The restaurant was busy but service was still above and beyond. We were seated immediately upon entering and the server came right over and asked what we would like to drink.    I ordered the Western Omelet with fresh fruit.  It was a large portion and so tasty.  The fruit was extremely fresh and juicy.   I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone in the Las Vegas area.  It's open 24/7.  You can't beat a restaurant that is reasonably priced with delicious food and great service.  Eating off the strip will save you a bundle and in most cases the food and service is much better too!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's right next to my place, it's open forever and the food and people are sweet. Drop in and order the chorizo hash skillet...to die for!"}
{"text":"Great service. The smell throws me off inside. It smells like the rain water from the night before"}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting this place to be so good. Best pancakes i've ever had. Also tried the healthy breakfast burrito - perfect for a vegetarian like myself. Avocado, potatoes, tomatoes and egg in a yummy tortilla - huge portion so you can take half home! Tamara and Lucky were absolute sweethearts. I'll be back next time I go to Vegas to try the pie!"}
{"text":"It's a bakery and a restaurant, nothing fancy but hearty breakfast and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great restaurant off the Vegas strip for breakfast and lunch. Food is good and great attention."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for take out breakfast for 2 this morning before heading back to LA. The experience that I had which should have been simple ended up being so bad it's almost laughable.  In case you need a reminder of the basics when working in the food service industry, just read this review. This covers most everything.   1. Greeting customers When I entered this place, I walked up to the counter where you pay. There were 4 employees standing directly behind this area chatting with each other about non-work related things. They looked at me but did not say anything for what seemed like forever. 2 of them left and the other 2 proceeded to chat about a stain on their hoodie (a conversation which also included the hoodie being placed on the counter to show the other worker). While I stood there feeling awkward, one of them looked at me with a very obviously irritated look because clearly I was interrupting their personal chat time. After more awkward waiting, someone finally came over to greet me.   2. Workplace knowledge I asked a question about one of the menu items and was given wrong information. The basic question involved what sides were included with the menu item. I apologized because I thought I was wrong, but then after ordering I googled it and found out that I was right, so I went and \"changed\" (aka corrected) my order.  3. Paying attention When I received my order, I was not given the coffee I purchased. When I asked for it, the worker was unapologetic and didn't even remember how many I ordered.   4. Basic food safety/proper cooking  When I got back to my hotel and was eating my food, I noticed that the sausage was totally pink inside (see image). I'm no chef, but I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be like that.. In addition, I was only given utensils for 1 person. Total fail.   The only good thing about this breakfast was that the pancakes were tasty. However, the soggy bacon and undercooked sausage don't allow me to say that the food was good overall.   I don't want to say that all of the employees at this location are terrible, but the 6 young ones that I encountered this morning definitely do not do their jobs appropriately at all."}
{"text":"This is the worst Coco's I have ever been to. The service is slow and the food was overcooked. But that wasn't the worst part the worst part was that a roach ran across my table while i was eating. Ruined my appetite and the manager acted like this happens all the time.   Nothing was done."}
{"text":"Stayed in the area for business, and had the opportunity to dine for breakfast, lunch and dinner several times.  Not once was I disappointed.  Breakfast items were unique (try the smoked gouda and hash omelette), burgers and sandwiches were hearty and dinner items plentiful and tasty.  Not pricey at all - and be sure to take home a piece of pie.  Worth the visit...especially helpful on the wallet!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service, nice homey, clean restaurant.  The Breakfast Special is EXCELLENT value for $4.99! My teenage son got that - and when we come back we plan to ALL get it next time :)  The kids got the smiley face pancake... Because of the nuts in it, my daughter didn't love it, but she still ate it.  I got the Tomato & Mushroom breakfast from the Lean menu -- only 190 calories!! Whoooo hooo! ;) But, in hindsight it wasn't the best choice or best value, since I'll likely be hungry again soon, with all the Vegas walking about the occur! ;)  Definitely a great spot to bring the kids and not spend a fortune! Very happy we found this place (thanks to Yelp reviews!) on day #1.  We will be back - probably tomorrow! ;)"}
{"text":"Great food at very affordable prices. This place is just off the strip and offers very good value! It's worth getting in the car or ride share over there, instead of paying more for less at one of the big hotels. The staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place now is the view. The service is not that good and the food is the same . This place has been going down hill like a bad putt the last few years . The Cocos on Bell is a lot better ."}
{"text":"Character written all over this joint, It's like that friend of yours that you know has just been around the block a few times, but still a good friend. You know?   I didn't eat much, it was some type of cream filled crepe topped with strawberries and whipped cream, but yummy none the less. The waitress was nice and closed the blinds part way through the meal to shield all of us sitting near the windows from the sun. Very considerate, I like considerate people, a lot more than those who aren't. But I don't remember getting a refill on my water...  All in all, not a bad experience but not a awesome one, so 3 stars, yay for Coco's."}
{"text":"Cocos is a haven of reasonable pricing and good breakfast in overpriced Vegas. Good chicken fried steak!!!Close to MGM. Javier is awesome."}
{"text":"The wait was less than 5 minutes. I love Coco's food never disappoints me.  Tried country fried steak first time some 10 years ago and its still good! I ordered the corn beef hash skillet served with toast and fruits. Orange juice and left a happy customer. Near the strip lots of parking available!"}
{"text":"Great food at great price!! The mimosa were the best!! The food was delicious, definitely home cooked! The waitresses where very nice and attentive!! They made sure to keep the mimosa's coming! My sisters and I was very please with the service and food we received! I highly reccommend trying this place for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Coco's is probably one of your better bets in Vegas for an affordable breakfast in Vegas.  Aside from the \"B\" Food Safety Restaurant Inspection card rating (at the time of this review) posted at the cashier, this place seems to be pretty good and pretty affordable (no crazy inflated pricing) .  They even have an awesome deal on burger's and fries for $4.99 which is pretty damn hard to beat anywhere in Vegas.  This became my regular breakfast joint considering that I could get a bowl of quality steel cut oatmeal with blueberries, bananas, milk & brown sugar for a few cents more than a small cup of water with oats from the local Starbucks.  For a decent breakfast such as pancakes or french toast, it pretty much beats anything you'll find at your local casino in regards to value. I mean it's not \"gourmet\" food but it gets the job done at a fair price.  The service is pretty good considering. I never had any problems with the waitstaff, hostess or cashier.  This will be my regular go to breakfast joint when I feel like saving some cash in order to splurge on other cool stuff in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was looking to kill some time, and grab some lunch before my flight home and Google, and Yelp suggested this place.  Okay, no, just no.    I pulled up and thought, okay, looks like an older coffee shop type place, and I like those ... NO.  NOPE.  Upon opening the door there was a funky smell, I thought maybe the sewer backed up, but then I was seated and felt light headed, and realized that smell was the additive in natural gas.  I got up, ordered pie to go, and the hostess seemed bothered by this \"fast\" choice of mine.  I'm not trying to die in Las Vegas, so, yes, it's fast.  I mentioned to her that the odor was awful, there were four people in the place besides employees, and I don't know how they could stand it.    It took me a while to get my head to stop spinning from being in that building.  The woman insisted it was some sort of cleaner they were using in the kitchen.  Funny, but, no.  The pie was great, I ordered coconut cream, but turned out to be banana cream, and it was spot on delish!!!  That's why they got the second star.  This Coco's needs serious upgrading and better air flow."}
{"text":"I think we might have been better off coming here for breakfast or brunch. We were seated right away for dinner, and our waitress was very nice and attentive. I got the rib dinner and it was just ok, so much so that I didn't get dessert. The shrimp was breaded and seemed like the ones I might be able to purchase in the frozen food section. The prices were reasonable, but I would come back just to do breakfast but that would be about it."}
{"text":"I had just got back into town after flying all night and thought I wanted breakfast. This place was convenient from the airport. The waitress was good ,on top of everything. The only complaint I had was the coffee cake I ordered looked nothing like the photo. The piece was small and they serve hot with a chunk of butter. I prefer cold. It was ok.  My husband ordered a regular egg breakfast and everything seemed to be good.  Over all with the place being busy the food came out fast.  We have ate here before and it's not bad for typical coffee shop/ dinner food."}
{"text":"Ew. Rude staff, smells like smoke, shady location. Mediocre food. We tried it and will not be back. I'm surprised it's still open."}
{"text":"We stopped at Coco's for breakfast this morning since we were in the area.  Both my husband and I have a thing about eggs with runny whites.  We like the yolks runny, but NOT the whites - at all.  Over medium should meet our requirements, but we also inform our servers that in particular that we can't eat runny whites.   We each ordered the breakfast combo, his with fruit and pancakes, and mine with potatoes and an upgrade to cinnamon roll French toast.  We both had coffee.  We specifically ordered the eggs indicating that we wanted them medium, whites completely done.    When the food arrived, I checked my eggs.  The whites were runny.  I moved the plate with the eggs and potatoes over to the edge of the table.  When the server was back in the area, I indicated to her that the eggs were not done as specified and had her take the eggs and potatoes away and settled in to eat my one piece of cinnamon roll French toast and my two pieces of bacon.  As it turned out, my husband's eggs were the same as mine, but he ate around the puddles of undercooked egg whites because he was hungry.  Neither of our eggs had been properly prepared.  In the end, our server deducted one cup of coffee from our check for the portion of my breakfast (most of it) that I had her take away because of the eggs (this included the entire order of home fries).  I won't be returning. I felt way overcharged for two pieces of limp bacon and one piece of French toast."}
{"text":"Meh, says it. The $6.99 pumpkin pie I bought a month before Thanksgiving was OK so I thought I'd go back for a turkey day one too. That one was disappointing. It was filled less than I remembered the first was and at about an inch of filling, it was easily 2/3 of what the pie should have been for the price. The taste was not so special either. I'll get a Mrs. Smith's at the grocery next time. Cheaper and more pie."}
{"text":"Great service, cheap food (a rarity in Las Vegas), and relatively tasty meals. A great place to go to eat off a hangover. We were seated right away on a Friday morning at 10:30."}
{"text":"We went there for hangover breakfast after night out in Vegas, very friendly staff, quickly served and burger was absolutely amazing. You can choose how well you want your meat to be done, have free refill and the food was filling as well;) go there!"}
{"text":"I came here after church when visiting some family. It was a long wait, but seemed to me moving along nicely. The staff was very kind and accommodating, just really busy.  I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because it is a nice place, but isn't really my style. I know it's Arizona, but it was all older people.  Not a young crowd but a good place for a filling breakfast.   Service was solid.  Parking was there but you may have to park far away."}
{"text":"Breakfast here was great. The multi grain pancakes were thick and delicious. More importantly, the coffee was very good (especially compared to my hotel's coffee... Ick!). I paid $10 total for the meal.  The waitresses were very friendly and prompt. The bathroom was clean. The only downside is that the place does seem to get busy around brunch time.   I am looking forward to eating at Coco's again before my flight.  The restaurant is located between the Motel 8 and Hooters, in front of America's Best Value Inn. Directly across the street is the MGM."}
{"text":"I should've taken a picture of the food. I don't know why I didn't. But I've never been so disappointed in Cocos. You guys did me wrong today. I always order the Blackened Baramundi dish. I don't know who was in the kitchen today but they need to learn to FULLY COOK the food. Fish fillets usually don't take much time. My fillet was raw down the center of it and my zucchini was so hard it tasted like it went straight from the fridge to the microwave and on the plate. Very unimpressive!   That was the food. Now, the real disappointment happened when i tried to enjoy my slice of Pecan Pie. Like, what happened? I think it's old.... It has to be old. I'm gonna post the picture i took of the pie. You be the judge. I was in a hurry to get to work. My best advice, check your food before you leave. Cocos is normally one of my favorite places. But today they LITERALLY put a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad, very dirty, loud but I guess if you want cheap, knock yourself out!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast location and good prices. Came here with a group of five and we all finished our entire meals. The waiter was nice, they did a good job refilling our drinks and getting us whatever we asked for. We were seated pretty quickly and the location is near the strip."}
{"text":"We have tried this particular Coco's previously and it was Abysmal, the food looked like it was straight out of a 'Hungry Man' dinner.. if only it had tasted that good.  About a Year later we moved into Coronado neighborhood and because it seemed to have a good sized crowd we gave it another chance. On that particular visit, the food was pretty good and the service wasn't bad for an early supper. On our next two subsequent trips our meal was slow in coming out, overcooked, Yet cold to the touch.   We tried to purchase a 'Pie-of-the-month' On the First day of the month.. It was NOT Available.. and they did not offer any recompense or substitution.  We did go once for lunch  and it wasn't all bad..  But on the Final Meal there.. we both ordered the prime rib burger and quesadilla appetizer..The burgers came out 30 minutes later, They were grossly overcooked.. Crispy black with Dry DRY DRY prime rib that was falling apart  in not a good way.  They totally forgot our  appetizer.. and the server gave us the excuse.. They couldn't find any Tortillas... Ok.. we live in Phoenix,, There's  a Taco shop across the street, Numerous Grocery stores just down the street.. How silly..  They didn't care and when the Manager came out.. He didn't charge us.. but didn't really apologize either.. We shall never be going there again.    The Tables were Grossly dirty on the edges.. carpet is filthy and people just hanging about on their laptops talking loudly and using the wifi..  The Servers seem nice.. but the entire Management seems to Just  Not Care.. It Needs a Good Cleaning.. Consistant cooks that know how to Cook and Maybe if Corporate came in and  took a hose to everything .. It might have a chance."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food, fast service and the customer service is amazing, best coco's I've ever been to. Great job!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place in Vegas! Tasty, healthy and affordable! Portions are good to share, stuff is very friendly and helpful. And it's just 5 minutes walk from MGM"}
{"text":"Staying close by the America's Best Value Inn, our choices for food weren't great. And by outside appearances, we kept our expectations in check. However, the breakfast offering are delicious. The food was served hot and fresh and volumes were on point. Value is there too. Would I recommend? Absolutely! We are glad to have a great dining close by to where we were staying."}
{"text":"i cannot bring myself to giving a chain like coco's more then 3-4 stars.   this coco's i happen to like because i have been eating here on occasion for umm...ever. i forget what the place used to be called. but it wasn't much different then a coco's anyways.  they have a pretty good patty melt, and their pies are pretty good too. some of their \"specials\" are by far better then Denny's lol potacho, nuff said.  breakfast is pretty good too. so all in all it's a decent place, a-ok.  yelp."}
{"text":"This is a 2 star at best.  The prices is not $ should be $$.  I've gone to better restaurants with a smaller bill and more food.  The staff is what made it blah service.  They were not friendly and not sociable.  We brought our two kids and our waitress was a robot who made no connection.  She dropped the food off in front of us as she was serving someone that pissed her off. The food was around the mill nothing special and nothing terrible.  So with that being said, my wife had cherished memories of Cocos and this is the first time I've went; I rather stick with IHOP where they at least pretend to be friendly."}
