{"text":"The food was flavorful. They have a great selection. The service was extraordinary; very attractive staff. Prices are relative to the freshness of the food. Very clean. 
We were a party of 4.  Did not consume alcohol. We spent $75. 
Will always come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Bad attitude waiters, everyone seems to be half awake, unable to understand English, I spoke to them and it seemed like they didn't understand...

The food is ok, I enjoyed the pepper beef, but besides that, the beer battered fish with jalapeno uses bad batter, it gets soft after 5 minutes... The lobster is good but fresh seafood is always good.... Everything else I took a taste and put it down....

Truth I would of left this restaurant already just due to the attitude and the service, when a customer says the coke is flat, don't argue or give you two cent half assed opinion about how it's not, waiting to review the food, if my father did not know the chef here and was asked to try the restaurant out, it's not even worth my gas..."}
{"text":"THEY GAVE US RAW PORK shu Mai !!  Gross! They didn't seem to care when I complained so we walked out. Btw this is the second time. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"OK, but not great. Service was pretty good; we were promptly seated and frequently checked on. However, they would not split the check, saying each card needs a minimum charge of $20 to be swiped. The food was just so-so, and they did not have sesame chicken on the menu. Portions were also smaller than expected. It was hard to overlook that since the entrees were $12-15 and came with just a small side of white rice. It was pretty much twice the price for less food than the little Chinese restaurant on Pecos and Russell. I don't think we'll be back here."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! It was like i was in Chinatown in San Fransisco. From 11 to 3 they serve everything on the menu and then after 3 they serve a shortened menu"}
{"text":"Just had a great lunch with my wife here. Fast service and great food. Large banquet area and large ceilings, overall great feel and very clean. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Don't go. Shrimp dim sum extremely fishy smelling/tasting. Pork bun had gross little hard chipped bones. Servers stick their thumbs in every dim sum pot while serving it to you. We couldn't eat any of it. I went when they first opened and it was great. Not the case any more. Maybe that's why their \"Best of\" sign is from 2013. Stick with Chang's."}
{"text":"Something's going on there. While driving by the restaurant yesterday (Dec. 15), we noticed that the East Ocean signage had been removed and new signage for a place that I think is called Asia Palace was going up. We know the East Ocean management well, so I'll stop in there to see what this is all about."}
{"text":"Finally a good dim sum place in Las Vegas! This reminds me of all of the great ones in Southern California. The food is always consistent, hot and fresh. The restaurant also gets another thumbs up for being in Henderson, it's only a short drive away to satisfy my dim sum cravings!"}
{"text":"Very good dim sum. I no longer have to drive to spring mtn for it. Sticky rice, BBQ pork buns were both stand outs!!"}
{"text":"New sign out front (Asia Palace)... no surprise - don't know anything except that they will still be serving dim sum.

Don't know if it sold or new manager or just name change....I will not be the guinea pig this time... let me know if anyone tries it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and decor! I will not go to Orchid Garden on W. Sahara EVER again. 
The food was hot and fresh. The restaurant was so clean and lovely. We took the entire family and had a great time. 
A+"}
{"text":"Not sure if they have read the comments, but the Dim Sum was fantastic.  If you ask for your dish hot they will bring you out a dish just made.   The service was fast as well.    I would rank some of the dishes here better than Dim Sum in the Bay Area and Monterrey Park.  Try the (hot) salt and pepper chicken wings or the salt and pepper shrimp(you eat the shell and all).  The custard buns and the bbq pork pastries were amazing.  Also order the Chow Mein Hong Kong style with crispy noodles (not the one on the cart).  Most of my friends expect a Panda Express experience when first trying Dim Sum.  Cantonese style cooking is very different than Schezwan...  the flavors are more subtle.   Be prepared for mild ginger, scallions, steamed bread, plainer noodles and five spice.  You can always spice things up with chilly sauce, soy sauce and white pepper at the table."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great but only one of the waiters knew how to speak english. I ordered the pot stickers and deep fried pork dumplings. The food was greasy and no good. The food was wheeled out in a cart and was at least 1 hour old. It was awful."}
{"text":"Here's the the deal, the food is very good here, but the attitude -atrocious. The owners are probably wondering why their restaurant is so empty in the evenings- try working with your staff's people skills. The waiter who we always seem to get makes us feel like second hand citizens- smirking at what we order. Any extra request is treated with a roll of the eyes. I have never had service feel less gracious. The hostess always seems miserable. 
I am giving this restaurant 4 stars because I don't want them to go out of business.
But I probably won't be as kind next time.
To the management- please ask your staff to be less snarky. Your food is too good to lose customers this way."}
{"text":"Dim sum is good.  It's comparable to other places.  It's close to where I live so that's another plus.  Dinner is not the greatest.  Usually when you order Egg Foo Young, it has the meat choice on the outside as well.  A little more decorative in the plate, but this place, it's just the egg patty and everything inside and sauce over it.  It taste decent, but could had been better.  This place is better for Dim Sum only and not for dinner."}
{"text":"I'm from California so I know my dim sum. The dim sum here is hit or miss, the quality is comparable to orchid garden (at its best) but not better than Ping Pang Pong. Despite the bad reviews and low score, the place seems to be always packed. 

I have to give it props for a few things: better customer service (some actual English speaking waiters/waitresses), the place is spacious and clean (this is a big deal since most Chinese restaurants in Vegas lack this), also the food is decent. 

The big flaw they have is their check tendering process. This is always the worst part of the experience. Of all the several times I've been there, once we ask for the check, it gets lost in the abyss of no return. You could wait a whole half an hour for your bill to return, but no one would bring it. Even if you get up and go to the cashier to pay, there's always a long line. Obviously there's something wrong with their process.

Overall I would definitely come back here, since this is the only place with   that actually looks like what it should be. I hope they fix their flaws and improve their food quality in the future. It's nice to have a Chinese restaurant in this area."}
{"text":"We moved to Sun City Anthem from Buffalo, New York recently. We used to drive to Toronto and enjoy the Dim Sum lunch. We are so glad that we found the East Ocean Dim Sum restaurant in Henderson. The Dim Sum dishes are delicious, fresh, and hot. When we chatted with the manager and mentioned about the review in yelp web site, he told us that they are getting used to the new food carrying carts and the food can be kept fresh and hot well now. So, we would give it a five star rating. We will return and enjoy the good food soon."}
{"text":"So, it seems as though (despite having a healthy Asian population), finding good dim sum (outside of Chinatown, and even then...) in Las Vegas borders on the intolerable.

This place is huge, I mean gigantic, every time I have been in there (three times now) it is been all but empty.  Across the board, the service was horrifying.  What is curious about that, is that I am a three time a year traveler to Asia and the Pacific Rim for business.  Everywhere I go from China to Bangkok to Vietnam, and even Australia (technically part of the Pacific Rim and with thriving Asian population); I rarely find rude, or bad service.  It is oftentimes curt and efficient but not rude.  However, it seems as though I can COUNT ON questionable service from a huge variety of Asian restaurants here in Las Vegas most notably is: East Ocean Dim Sum & Seafood Restaurant.  

Now, I am only speaking for me, here in Las Vegas (where I live).  Regrettably, East Ocean Dim Sum & Seafood Restaurant has managed to massively fall short on service, quality of food, atmosphere, and responsiveness.

My first two experiences were when the restaurant was relatively new, and I attributed the food and the service to 'being new', and trying to 'shake out the bugs'.  My third experience (the one for which I am writing this review) was, if possible, worse than my first two experiences combined despite being many, many months later.  The carts were austere (at best), the food was cold (often times a bit slimy), the service was abysmal, I felt as though every request was 'putting someone out', and that my patronage was not only annoying, but superfluous, and undeserved - and also, there was an atmosphere of lackadaisical attention to detail, and a persistent although ever present mild contempt for the clientele.

It is my emphatic recommendation that you skip this restaurant, go to Chinatown, and enjoy less marginal dim sum almost anywhere else..."}
{"text":"As we eat out more than we eat at home we decided to try East Ocean.  We drive by it on Eastern all the time.  One star is all I can say.  The Dim Sum was wonderful but no where did it list prices. The entrees yuck  would rather go to Panda Express.  This is so over-rated will not go back.  The service was so so (we did get refills constantly on our sodas) watched a female start taking an order from a table and her cell phone rang, she answered and walked away from the guests placing their order.  AND then she walks to us and her phone rings again and she answered, guess we should have left then.  Lots of tables available and there was only 5 tables that had guests (we were there 5pm)"}
{"text":"Came in at 9pm. Friday night. They close at 10pm. Ordered 3 items. Served in  less than 10minutes. I said wow that was fast! This lady said they are easy to make, you just fry them. While we were eating  mind you, not even second bite of my food, this same lady gave us our check and said \"here is your bill so I can close my cashier while you guys are eating\". We did not say anything, but that was super rude! Service is horrible! And she came for the second time asked us again if the bill was ready! Are you serious!! Come on let us enjoy our food first!. Checked our receipt and this lady name is Janey. We were out at 9:35pm. I would give zero star if I could.  Definetely need some customer service training!"}
{"text":"East Ocean Dim Sum and Seafood Restaurant was something similar to finding a lost 
treasure! You spend so long searching and then surprise! Upon arriving there was a big parking 
lot, so it was not difficult to find a nice space near the restaurant. The outside was very clean and 
welcoming. There was an aroma of sweet starchy foods being cooked as soon you get out of your 
car! When arriving inside you are greeted. The ambiance was very calming with people and 
television being heard in the background. You get a feeling of the restaurant being welcoming, 
and comforting with the floor space. There was this large cinematic art strip that displayed Asian 
culture of cities and food dishes. The service was good. The food was placed and this spinning 
plate on the table called a \"Lazy Susan\" very convenient.
 The Chicken Shumai was soft, rubbery, and thick. The aroma was bland wild a mild tone 
taste. The flavor was bland yet fresh. The texture was smooth and hot. The Shrimp Dumpling 
was soft and chewy. The aroma was bland having a mild tone of taste to it. It was hot and smooth 
in texture with a fresh and fishy flavoring. The Salt and pepper fish had a mild tone to it, and 
very hot! The fish was crispy, moist, and tender with a fresh and fishy aroma. The flavoring was
 salty and sharp. Everything was amazing I left satisfied!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was alright. the only thing is that the dim sum carts were barely around. for us, it only came ONCE. that's all. we came in on a Sunday and I would think for a weekend day, it would be somewhat crowded, right? wrong. There were 3 tables taken while we were there and the restaurant itself was pretty big. from our first and only cart round, we got pork buns and shomai. That's all we ate. I was looking for other choices such as dumplings, but since I never seen the dim sum cart ever again, I had to order it. 3 plates and we were full. Weird, because usually we get 10 plates of dim dim for 2 people only and that's good. The only thing I liked most about this restaurant was its piano playing music in the background. It gives the restaurant ambience. I don't think I'll ever come back here again though."}
{"text":"This place is going downhill. Very inconsistent. I like that it's closer to me, but it's really not worth it after my last experience. Went there for Chinese New Year dim sum with my family. Was told by female manager that there was still a lot of variety going around, but it turns out a number of our favorites were missing. Pork in all the dishes was very white, like they forgot the soy sauce or something. Meat & shrimp were not sticking together at all in the Siu Mai. Noodles were bland. Very inattentive and poor customer service. The male manager walked by, and I started talking to him when his cell phone rang. He answered the call promptly without excusing himself, walked away, and never came back. I thought it was very rude of him. Better to make the trek to Chinatown for dim sum done right at either Orchids Garden or Ping Pang Pong."}
{"text":"This is a new place so I factored that into my review.  I've been twice (Sundays) for dim sum, all my favorites and even some yummy specials like noodles in XO sauce. Finally a place in Hendo! Also paid $27 for 3 people and even had leftovers, great prices! Hope they work out their service kinks.. But it is Chinese so it's expected, it's not hard to get one of the many server's attention to just ask for the dish you want."}
{"text":"The service is the best thing about this place.  That is why I gave them two stars.  The rest is down hill from there.  No flavor!  Too expensive!  Limited variety of dim sum! I'd rather go a little farther and enjoy a greater variety at a more reasonable price.  Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since they've changed management. Went here  Chinese new year and to my surprise it wasn't packed. Their Dimsum is still tops for this side of town and price is just right. I do miss the baked barbequed pork buns from the previous management though. The food is still good."}
{"text":"Expensive: staff pushes the expensive dishes on you so be careful!! Food is average, nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is ok...not good and not bad.  

My recommendation is to go after 12...because I went 30 minutes after opening and ate what didn't sell on the dim sum carts the day before.  Dim Sum is simple and must be fresh...and soooo obvious when it isn't.  

I've been several times and the food is consistent when you get there after 12.  4 stars when cooked the same day and 2 stars when eating what should have been given  to the staff at the end of the day."}
{"text":"For the singular reason of being on the east side of town this  place rocks, I had heard many bad things about this place my expectations were  nonexistent. That being said I was pleasently suprised and pleased with the food and service. My favorites eggplant-shrimp, sesame buns, salt and pepper shrimp and calamari were all as good as any other dim sum I have had.  I can not speak to the variety because I always order the same things! I didnt see any crab balls (sad face )"}
{"text":"It's almost better than the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm so happy yelp helped me find this place. Just when I thought Vegas was about nothing but which buffet should I try my luck at today. Then yelp helped me find this place. It was great to be able to come here instead of having to stay at the casinos or along the strip. Although for those visitors without a car, sorry. L It's outside of Vegas and must drive via car or taxi service. But I'm so happy cause I had a car this trip and I wasn't segregated to only The Vegas Strip. So I guess there is a normal life outside of Vegas with normal people and normal food other than high priced bad buffets. If you want a great taste of dim sum, then definitely come here to East Ocean."}
{"text":"It seems like this place is a hit or miss with most yelpers. Unfortunately for me, it is a miss. This is probably the worst dim sum place I've been to in Las Vegas. Service was next to nothing and we only saw two dim sum carts during our entire meal. They each came once and we never saw them again. Dim sum was just okay - the temperature was warm and there wasn't much of a selection to choose from. 

We also ordered a chicken dish (I forgot what it was called) off of the dinner menu and that was good but it seemed a bit overpriced for the amount that we got. 

On top of that the people working here were talking to each other in Chinese and asking why we didn't get more items. That, on top of all the other things that went wrong during my visit, is the reason why I will not be coming here again. 

One menu item and 4 dim sum dishes = 31$ tab."}
{"text":"I like how we sat down and we were already eating! Dim sum was tasty. Diggin the Xmas decor."}
{"text":"We tried East Ocean for dinner last night and were very disappointed. The Dim Sum was very dry and inside was too salty. We also tried the Orange chicken for my child and it was different from most Orange chicken. The egg rolls were very soggy inside. The Restaurant was pretty empty for 6:45 pm. But after trying the food I can see why. Servers are not people persons, very standoffish. Took East Ocean off my list as a place to have Dim Sum or Chinese food. Big disappointment!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went this place little after 1pm on Wednesday only 5-6 tables were occupied. Why slow???
Wait staff were friendly and food was ok and not bad at all. I was still question myself why Slow??? 
Not much people were eating Dim sum and they were ordering from menu. 
I found out why when I got a check. Just 2 of us and we didn't have much without alcohol cost $50!!! Pricy!
That's why people were ordering from menu because cheaper.
Other dim sum restaurants are much cheaper and better food. I went this place because close to where we were visited."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of weeks ago. Food was decent. Not crazy amazing. Service was horrible. I felt like instead of being helpful they were pushing food onto me. Also they messed up on our check and the table next to ours. Instead of apologizing and what not one guy kept yelling at the table next to us. It is clear to see that they do not know how to deal with customer issues. We kept quiet while watching them argue. 

Not impressed at all. Will try somewhere else in the future."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times now, food is good but not great. Could be better. Perhaps more selection on the dim sum and less on what they're trying to promote like, sushi rolls. Come on! Its a dim sum place not a Japanese restaurant!  
Service on the other hand,  Ehhhh. .... they check on you if they have something new not when US guest needs sonething? 
I'd still be back since its the closest dim sum by my house..."}
{"text":"We've read some reviews on the RJ newspaper and they gave them a lot of compliments. We decided to give it a try. We arrived about 1:30pm, its not very busy inside.  But, to our BIG disappointment,  the food is not that tasty and flavory, because they are COLD. (that's a No, No for DimSum). The waitresses pushed the carts around the restaurant, if there were nobody picking them, then they just parked the cart there. Hopefully they can come up with some ideas to keep food hot and fresh. Otherwise this would be our first time,  probably the last time for us to eat there."}
{"text":"When the craving for non-chain Chinese food hits (I'm looking at you, Panda Express), this place is a decent alternative. And by decent, I mean \"not always good\"."}
{"text":"This (who owns this place now) restaurant is a disaster! Food was so greasy it really was inedible. Service was inattentive and manager even worse. She struts in carring lobster in paper bags and drops them in front of our table..yuck! Ambience is a joke...a large room with loud music, tables and chairs from wherever...hey, bottom line is stay away this one or buyer beware."}
{"text":"I love dimsum and Im kinda disappointed with this one. Restaurant doesn't have a menu for us to see how much their food range. Me and my boyf ate here and we only had like few dimsums and sticky rice and our bill gone like $40+ oh my god too expensive. I also dont understand what those servers are saying like srsly if you gonna repeat the words they were saying yknow just to clarify they gonna look at you like pissed and annoyed like wtf. Im not gonna go back here anymore. Sucks."}
{"text":"Food was ok make sure your check is correct I left tips on tables but they added tip themselves. It's bad business ethnic to rip people off. Never going back."}
{"text":"So it was my first time at a dim sum place, and well if it lives up to this visit it won't be my last. We came in and said we wanted to try dim sum, the older hostess said ok, sat us down, and poured some tea. The tea was good and u like how all the leaves were in the pot. The first cart came around and we got the duck and walnut shrimp, both were really good. Then came the steams and we got the bar b q pork bun things, shrimp seafood dumplings, and a regular shrimp dumpling, those were all good, we got the egg drop soup which was better than any other place I've had because they put alot of veggies in it which I like. And we also had the deep fried shrimp rolls, for dessert we had coconut bread things, it was good, price was like 46 something change, service could have been alot better but it was all cool. The lady told me during the day they use a full dim sum menu, and at night it is limited, that is something to think about if you decide to go, but I liked it and we'll definitely be returning, and dim sum(see what I did there? Lol)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to eat an early dinner on a Saturday night.  The restaurant was not crowded. I only mention this because the service was haphazard. They weren't rushed. 

We ordered the pot stickers as an appetizer, which were okay.  My husband ordered wonton soup.  The broth didn't taste like a Chinese broth, but more like the kind of broth that should have matzo balls in it.  The wontons were stuffed with some kind of mystery meat. 

When I ordered the main course, I asked the waitress for information about some of the chef specialties but I didn't get a description I could understand and there was no explanation of the dishes written in the menu. I ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce (my favorite). My husband ordered a vegetarian egg foo young.  The shrimp dish was very yellow and bland, served before the steamed rice and long before my husband's meal. His egg foo young was an enormous brown blob that looked as though something had died on the plate. He ate only a few bites.  There was great deal of food leftover and we refused to take any of it home with us. 

Yuck"}
{"text":"Really fresh and good. The restaurant is in the suburbs. However slightly more pricey for dimsum. However better than anything in arizona. Cute decor inside"}
{"text":"Great Chinese and dim sum restaurant - so nice to have in Henderson!  East Ocean is now my go-to place for a pleasant Chinese dining experience.  Previously I did the trek to some of the places near the strip or in China Town.  Now I am Very Happy to have found East Ocean. Everything we have ordered is delicious and the atmosphere is pleasing too."}
{"text":"I don't like Chinese food that much, but my bf loves it. So we tried this place. I loved their duck buns. The waiter comes to your table and slices and serves it to you. It was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. Will come back for these yummy duck buns."}
{"text":"It cannot compare with any Chinese restaurant in Chinatown.  The dim sum is substandard, by Chinese standards.  But the location is convenient for Green Valley and for my causasian husband who does not want to travel far.  Pricey."}
{"text":"If i could give it no star at all i would. This place is a dump! They only had two tables and i had to wait for my food for 20 mins. Because the server was sitting down with another employee chatting away. I had to get up and ask her how much longer for my food?!!! Really??? The food didnt make up for the long wait. It was chewy and dry. I would not reccomend this place at all! Pls dont go here!vt least for dinner!  I am a chef at the strip and i know quality food when i see and taste it and this place doesnt have any of the qualities a good restaurant should have! Good food and good service that is... Just go to somewhere else. Dont waste you time and money"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant a couple of days ago and ordered shrimp fried rice to go.. The lady taking my order asks me why do all colored people order shrimp fried rice with a smile on her face!! So racist!!! I've been to this so many times and tipped well... But never again will I ever recommend someone to eat at this restaurant nor will they get another penny from me!!!!"}
{"text":"East Ocean is our go-to place to treat ourselves and guests on special occasions or just whenever we want to feel special. We also buy takeout from them when we have guests coming over and we want to treat them to a special Chinese meal.

For dine-in, our favorite is practically everything on the dimsum.

For take-out, we usually get the regular roast duck, the Peking duck, fried rice, fried chicken, noodles, and the hot pot."}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend because it was close to home.  Limited selection, food was not very fresh, getting a glass of water is almost impossible, un-friendly staff. Will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. My true \"stars\" rating would be 2 1/2. Still clean. Decent service. Congee is still good. But dim sum on a week day is NO GOOD. terrible selection. Not fresh. I haven't been there on a weekend in a long time. I feel like if you are going to advertise that you do dim sum 7 days a week- it should be on point, or at least the same all 7 days. Oh!!! Turnip cake- DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"We have heard good things about this place and so we gave it a try. The entrees off the cart are \"well traveled\" and a little worse for the wear. The dim sum carts are nice and steamy though. There are so many dumpling choices! (A few scary choices) like the chicken's feet. We also ordered a few entrees from the kitchen. The food was okay and the service was okay too. Some of our dishes were a bit cold but all in all we plan to go back."}
{"text":"Me and my girl love this place, been coming here for years. My favorite is shu Mai, har gow, and baked bbq buns. If you don't know, you better try something new in your life..haha. There are good places in Chinatown but this is the go to in Henderson area."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good dim sum restaurant in the area to take the hubby for his birthday dinner and found East Ocean Dim Sum. This place had 3 stars and the low ratings usually make me a little nervous. But, I like to see it for myself so we tried it anyway. 

I have to say that we had an excellent experience. We were greeted with smiles and seated immediately. The first dim sum cart came as soon as we settled at our table and we tried the steamed pork bun, shrimp shumai, steamed chicken feet, smelt and fried wontons. Most of the dim sum orders came with about 3 pieces. We also ordered egg foo yung, shrimp fried rice, fried chicken and honey walnut shrimp. In the end, the service was great and everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are a dim sum \"person\" this is your place. It may not be for novices, but if you know what you like - or are a bit adventurous about Chinese dim sum - this is your five start place for great food."}
{"text":"Not recommended. Went here with family to order take out chow mein on the way home from some place, did not want to go all the way to Chinatown..
1. Service ok. but no English..
2. Food was oily, greasy, cold and extremely salty and brown full of yucky oily soy sauce...
3. Pricey.... price not worth it... high end price for a nasty food."}
{"text":"Well, another extremely disappointing visit to a Vegas restaurant. I made a special trip to the area on Thanksgiving evening on the way to work intending on going to BJ's. Unfortunately for me, BJ's was closed. I drove around the shopping center to see who else was open and that is how I ended up at this place.

I went inside, took a paper menu out of paper menu stand which was right inside the door and decided on three items. I then waited for over five minutes for someone to take my order. A greeting would've been nice, but after five minutes it was beginning to look like I wasn't going to get any help at all. A lady sitting on a bench with a baby right inside the door finally got up and ran into the restaurant to get someone. Another lady showed up from somewhere in the back to take my order. She returned to the back where she came from.

I waited and waited some more for a man to show up this time with my credit card and receipt for me to sign. I looked at the items on the receipt and was surprised to see that I was being overcharged on two of the three items. When I questioned why the prices in the menu were different than the prices on my receipt, I was told that they were old menus and the price of seafood went up. I asked why I wasn't informed of this prior to ordering and was just given an apology. The man wrote $4.40 on my receipt and signed something (his name?) under it. He told me that would be a discount for the next time I went there. I should have just left at this point.

I signed the credit card receipt and my order came out shortly after that. I left and went to work. During my break at work, I removed my three items from the bag to find that two of the styrofoam cartons were broken and the contents were leaking out of them. I basically salvaged what I could and decided never to go back to this place again.

It's really wrong that they wouldn't honor the prices in their menu and tried to overcharge me without me noticing (I'm guessing). If after reading this, you still want to try this place, do not fall for all the Best of Vegas 2013 signs they've got hanging up in there. The food was nothing special. You can get better Asian food at most of the buffets around town."}
{"text":"It was my third visit here last weekend. However, it was my first time going around dinner. There was only one other table when we got there at around 6. The two men that \"served\" (if you can call it that) us were clueless on where to seat us, and worse they were clueless about the menu. They were rude and shouldn't be working in the service industry. He argued with us about a dimsum order, and then walked out on us. Long story short, we felt disrespected and we're definitely not coming back to this establishment."}
{"text":"They served me cold food. My family was there.  I can't believe all they wanted to do was to shove us the food but not care about our experience eating there. I guess I won't be back anymore."}
{"text":"We tried East Ocean this past weekend for our 3rd time and once again another strike. Strike 3 and they are OUT.   By noon the floors were disgusting, noticed that when they clear the tables they use a dirty towel and wipe excess food from the table right onto the floor. The floors were very slippery from the greasy foods. The service is pathetic, after 10 minutes we had to ask for hot tea, water and other drinks. Waiter seemed mad that we bothered him. When asked for certain dimsum they put the food on the table and then we had to ask them to add the sauces that come standard with certain dishes. We had our own notepad and kept count of how many orders we had, this time because the 2 prior times we thought we were overcharged. Sure enough when we we finished we noticed 2 extra stamps on the most expensive dimsum items at $6.95 each.  We had to wait another 10 minutes for \"the manager\", he actually laughed at us for saying they overcharged us. He said we must have miscounted.   We had a party of 7 people,  5 asian (non chinese) and 2 caucasians, we will be telling everyone how this place steals from customers."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst dim sum.  Granted we are used to San Fran or Hong Kong, but this is what Domino is to New York pizza.  Weekday late lunch may not have been a good time.  Service was courteous and attentive, place was clean, so two stars rather than one."}
{"text":"DON'T GO HERE!!!  WE ARE SICK . . . The place is dingy, and the waitstaff could not answer our questions.  They kept trying to make us take things we didn't want, and they didn't have what we did want.  Lunch was tea, soup, chow mein, pork, and pot sticker like balls.  IT was NO GOOD.  We both got sick, and the bill was closer to $30 (by a few pennies).  We feel they basically have to soak you because you only would eat there ONCE in a lifetime.  It was just SO BAD.  We both have sour tasting burps and I am having to stick close to the toilet.  I can't wait for this food to be out of my system!  What a waste of time and money.  It has been a horrible experience, which we hope will end soon."}
{"text":"It was kind of sad to see Roma Grill close, but I was very excited to see a dim sum  restaurant taking its place. Did this mean I can enjoy dim sum more often without having to drive so far?? Unfortunately for me, the answer is no...

My sister and I dropped in on this place one Saturday afternoon. The place is huge and most of the tables were occupied. But I don't think it was busy enough for the overturn of food to keep it hot and fresh. *THAT* was my biggest gripe about this place. The food overall was pretty good and they had a good selection of items (which is probably why I gave it a 3 instead of 2). But all the food was COLD. We chose a plate of chow mein noodles off the cart and the young lady offered to heat it up for us. At first I was taken aback. I appreciate her offering to heat it up, but it made me wonder how long it had been sitting on the cart. At first I thought maybe it was just us, but the table next to us was also harassing the same poor girl about all the food being cold.

One other thing I didn't like, there was a great inconsistency with the route of the carts. Since the restaurant is a big open space, you can see where certain carts are traveling. Several times, the same people would pass by the same section of tables and completely skip our side. Not just once. But several times. And they were carrying a completely different selection of food compared to the carts that actually did pass by us.

I would have given this place 2 stars, but the food is good. They just need to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"I have not gone to what was (and still appears to be) East Ocean for many months, because the dim sum was just terrible, as many posters have noted.  I had hopes that some changes for the better might be in the offing when I saw the new \"Asia Palace\" sign.

However when I logged onto the Asia Palace website, the URL is still \"eastocean.com\".  So it appears like it's going to be the same stale, cold dim sum under a new name,"}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant. The food was so fresh and delicious . Fast service. The music was good. The atmosphere was peaceful and relaxing. I give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Save your money, this place has bad food that has been left out for hours. Food poisoning, to add, the food is cold and they take it back and warm it in a microwave. I never thought any Chinese restaurant could screw up fried rice. Service is bad. They are so rude. Overall the food is yuk and service is even worse."}
{"text":"For a dim sum restaurant in Henderson, this place was fairly good. Worth the savings of driving all the way to spring mountain/china town. 

As with all dim sum restaurants, bring a large group of people so you can eat a lot of dishes. 

We had a large variety including:
BBQ pork bao (pork buns)- very good, nice flavor, good amount of pork in them. Possibly purchased, not made in house. 

Fried taro- dense and flavorless. Probably the biggest miss. 

Chicken feet- these were very good. Not too heavy on sauce. Nice and tender. 

Shu Mai- good. Nice flavor. Good texture, but probably purchased. 

Fried daikon cake- too soft, can hardly taste the daikon, sear on it was not up to par, but worked for Henderson. 

Gai Lan- good. Nice flavor. Cooked well. 

Shrimp fried rice (dim sum) - value plate. No sear on the rice, very few tiny shrimp. 

Beef fried ho fan- good. Nice flavor. Good amount of beef. 

Steamed Short ribs- mediocre. Not outstanding. Missing fermented black beans. 

Sticky rice in river leaf- good, but heavy on the sticky rice, only a small piece of Chinese sausage inside. 

Sweet buns- bread was nice and light/ fluffy. Good texture. 

Sweet Steamed tofu- very good. Nice flavor light way to hit the sweet craving at the end of your meal without feeling guilty. 

Overall, a good dim sum for Henderson, but Henderson is a very white/American area. If you live in Henderson, worth saving the trip."}
{"text":"We have been here before and liked it. It was ordering off of menus. We stopped by today to eat and the place was remodeled. It looks better but now it's dim sum. Which is fine. I liked the verity of choices better than some of the others in China Town. The only complaint I have is that most of everything we ordered was cold. The ladies kept telling us that they will warm up what we ordered.. I wonder how they are warming it up? In the microwave? I don't know but its not something I want to be happening to my food at a restaurant. I could do that at home. I dosent seem as fresh as coming from the pan to the plate and then to me."}
{"text":"Staff (dim sum lady) was very friendly. We were seated quickly but there wasn't a lot of customers either. Decor is cute but seems to be on the worn down side. Dim sum...sorry but this is a no-go for me. Maybe I am spoiled from eating dim sum outside of NV but this was probably the worst dim sum I ever had. I hate to say it because the people were nice."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, the service is \"mostly confused\" to be kind. The presentation was nonexistent - they just slop it on the plate with no attempt at making it look like anything other than that they slopped it on the plate. The food quality seemed OK but not impressive. What was really a turn-off is that they have shark fin soup on the menu, for anybody who knows how shark fins are obtained. Surprisingly, for a place that advertises as a Dim Sum restaurant, they really didn't have that much Dim Sum on the menu, and so we ordered something else. Probably more Chinese friendly than non-Chinese friendly, sort of the place that you take your family for Chinese -- if you are lukewarm on your family."}
{"text":"First time here n Never been here!! Would never come again! I usually go to china town for dim sum, but didn't want to drive all that way since I live in the Henderson area n jst Wanted some dim sum to go!! And couldn't get any! The lady brought out a tray with a few dishes that was NOT appealing! Looked old. And I asked if I could see other dishes, she tells me there isn't any but I can special order it! I than asked her if I was to sit and eat in the restaurant! That is the only tray of food they have and she said yes, but I can special order it!! I've never been to a dim sum place that they only have 1 tray of food!! And they got the best of Las Vegas 2013!!?? I'm confuse how they even got that!! Horrible!! Horrrrrrrible service!! And they only have one tray of food to pass around!!! Still so confuse!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the dim sum at lunch time. I enjoy the short ribs, the shrimp ball, the pork dumplings, the red bean pastries. I don't know the names of some of the dim sum selections, but I can point them out. I've also had dinner there. The black pepper beef is amazing, and they did a whole sweet and sour fish for us---tender and moist. The Chinese broccoli is excellent. Love the big round tables. Really-- I think the fact that over 2/3 of the restaurant was filled with Chinese patrons was my first clue that this would be legitimately good food. I have been here several times, and I have always had great experiences. It's not super Americanized, and the variety was pretty wide. Once, when I wasn't feeling well, I had their watercress soup, which was also very nice---alkaline and healing."}
{"text":"Will never go back to this place.  The air condition is not working and when we asked the servers, they did not understand us.  We paid $10.81 for 2 cokes, 2 lemonade, 1 ice tea, and 1 hot tea."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a dr appt and my daughter wanted dim sum so we tried this place out. Really nice and roomy but a bit overpriced. We ordered 8 items and my bill came out to $45. If we had gone to orchid garden my bill probably would've been $30 for the same items. Dim sum was not something I would go back for, the suimai was small and the steamed pork buns were very dry."}
{"text":"Not bad but nothing special at all. It's nice to eat Chinese food without it being overwhelmingly oily. Unless you are a local to the area, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"New favorite dim sum spot! Pick & choose what you want, get stamped on a card at your table, pay at the end. Big venue, well decorated, lots of seating, plenty of carts... Everything was delicious! No complaints at all. 

To name a few, we ordered:
- SHRIMP HAR GOW
- PORK SHUMAI
- SHRIMP SHUMAI
- BEEF & BROCOLI
- CHOW FUN NOODLES 
- CHICKEN FEET 
- FRIED SHRIMP DUMPLINGS
- STEAMED GREEN BEANS 
- SPARE RIBS 

Also, they had amazing hot tea. Definitely enjoyed our first experience & we will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Everyone that works here is very helpful in choosing from the different carts that come around. I know I get really confused about what is what and worry about the taste but everything they recommended was really tasty. Lots of variety and everything is fresh!  Also, they sat us pretty quickly and the carts came around in the perfect timing. If we were looking for a certain item they would bring it to us promptly. The thing we loved the most was the refill on soda is free! Lol! Good dim sum place!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were craving dim sum after our workout. It is conveniently a couple minutes drive down the street from the Green Valley LVAC on eastern. Location was easy to find. It is in the same parking lot as the the Paul Mitchell School of Beauty, BJs restaurant, and Mosaic Salon.This dim sum restaurant was very clean and appealing go the eye. It has a bar, stage for performances, and a modern twist to its decor. And its huge! The workers were very attentive and always offering what was in their dim sum carts. Their food was delicious and pricing was the typical dim sum pricing from $3 to $7 per plate. I definitely getting your dim sum fix here!"}
{"text":"If you are in this area and want just ok dim sum this is only choice. It's pricey for the quality. Drive the extra 15 minutes and go to Ping Pang Pong."}
{"text":"The Dim Sum was below average. I was with my THAI wife and son. It was really strange the staff wanted to touch my son during the entire meal. I ask one female server not to touch my son 17 month old. She continued to hang around our table wierd. The people sitting next to us thought it was crazy. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat chinese food! I'd rather travel 45 minutes going Orchid Garden than being stuck here for 20 minutes waiting for someone to take my order!"}
{"text":"We missed the Dim Sum. So we just ordered separate dishes to share. They didn't have cake noodles. But the crispy noodles were close enough. I say that was the best of all the dishes. On a 10-best scale, it was a 6-1/2. The second best thing we tried was the salt/pepper fried pork chops. But, there's definitely better at other restaurants in town. Never ordering the orange chicken and mayo walnut shrimp ever again.... Sure, the venue was convenient to my home. But, I would've been much more satisfied making a 30-40 minute round-trip commute to any other restaurant on Spring Mountain, or to Diamond China."}
{"text":"We went on Christmas Eve. We have loved Ocean for the past few years. They have changed their name, but that is not all. So disappointing. It should have been packed at prime time on a holiday weekend. What we noticed was the drop in quality. Why is there shrimp ball mixture in the Shui Mei and all the other shrimp dishes, even the Har Kow wasn't right. This was between 12 and 1pm....when the carts came around and we selected items they had to be taken back to the kitchen for warming. WHY?? It seemed like many items were 'old' just not fresh tasting and leftovers had very strong, unsavory odors. They were very slow and inconsistent with service. Truly so sad as we were hoping for a fun and enjoyable holiday dim sum experience. Time to try the other side of town."}
{"text":"food was ok but service is very bad!!!!  no service at all.!!!  Not cominh back here.  ORCHID GARDEN is the best here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Average dim sum, terrible service. 

I recently had Dim Sum with my boyfriend here a few days ago. It was around 5:30 PM and there was only two other small parties in the restaurant. In short: we got there at 5:30PM and left at 7:00 PM and only got offered their selection one time. 

We told the hostess/waitress we wanted to do Dim Sum right when we sat down. We ordered our drinks and I got my tea relatively fast, but it took them at least 10 minutes to let us know that their soda machine was broken and couldn't provide my boyfriend a Sprite. That wasn't a big deal as he just ordered a different drink. 
 
They brought around the dim sum cart ONCE. Literally ONCE. We had gotten a few items off that first round, but NEVER returned. We were NEVER checked up on, never asked if we were okay and never asked if we wanted anything else. At one point, we actually put a timer on to see how long it would be until someone would at least offer up to close our bill. 

Basically, an hour and a half of my time, money and appetite was wasted at this place. I don't think I ever want to return (which is a shame because it's nearby and they have decent food - if you ever get a chance to be offered something) based on this truly awful experience.

If you're hungry and expect to be happy from Dim Sum, don't go here. You'll end up hungry and irritated."}
{"text":"Terrible management this evening.
I'm only giving one star for the flavour of the food.  The dim sum that was available in the evening was tasty, as was the salted fish fried rice however the service took forever. 
We are visiting for the Easter weekend and after a long drive from Northern California we were hungry and looking for some good seafood.  We had a reservation but discovered an almost empty restaurant at 7pm.  We ordered the crispy squid with vegetables,  the lady confirmed that we wanted the crispy calamari style squid but then brought us a stir fried version with sauce!  -1 star
It took forever to get our to go boxes.  We had to ask twice for the boxes and the check,  -1 star
They screwed up big time with our bill, bringing us the wrong bill AND charging us with someone else's order! THEN they tried to compensate us by giving us $15 off our next bill!  What next bill?!?  When we asked to have the deduction applied to our bill now, the manager wanted to only give us $10 off!  Hello?  You offer us $15 for our next visit but only $10 for right now?   What makes you think I'm coming back to this restaurant? -2 stars (I'd take more off if I could)
I don't like giving bad reviews but this place deserves it, especially the manager of the evening.  Poor customer service.  The owner wasn't there to talk to."}
{"text":"Mediocre dim sum but one of the only places on the east side of town. Nicer atmosphere than some of the dim sum places in town.  If you are having a mid-day har gow craving.  It will fit the bill."}
{"text":"Went today for dim sum. Service was very bad and the food was worse then fair. The same dim sum carts with the same 8 items keep going by had 4 items but wanted to try other things but was none others to choose from after waiting for 30 min. we finally said enough of this and tryed to pay the bill but they charged us for too many plates and for tea that none of us had it took another 25 min. to fix that. Finally out of there mad and still starving we  headed to sping mountain and had a great meal. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant frequently since it opened. Recently noticed a change in the food quality and service. After allowing for fluctuations, today I again experienced the quality drop. I used to forego going to OrchidGarden for dim sum because  East Ocean is closer to me and the dim sum is almost comparable. The quality of the dim sum now has deteriorated so much that I must drive the extra distance to Orchid Garden. The service has deteriorated also. Now there are a few \"supervisor\" type walking around (doing what ?). The service still is unattentive and has deteriorated to the old cliche of poor Chinese restaurant service. Then the price has also gone up. So, overall East Ocean is no longer the substitute for the better Chinese restaurants along Spring Mtn. Sad  to see this happen because there are a lot of people in the Henderson area that appreciate good, if not excellent Chinese food."}
{"text":"This review is based on our dim sum experience. We did not enjoy this place. We were the first ones here. The hargow tasted old. We ordered chow mein and it was just okay. We ordered chow mein, har gow, and siomai.  The bill came out to be around $22. It's not worth coming to for dimsum. I'm hope their other food is good."}
{"text":"I came here with family during the weekend and it wasn't busy at all. We had dim sum and they have a good size of selections but the quality of food wasn't that good. If a restaurant is packed during the weekend, that's a good sign of quality of food and/or price.

Service is ok. They come and pick up the dishes, refill teas, etc. 

The restaurant is large and there's enough space for many large groups or even a banquet. 

I've had worse food so I think this place is ok but I would prefer to go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Came here last minute as we were leaving Vegas. The service was horrible. Took forever to get a menu and the place was practically empty. Then we found a lipstick stain on my mom's tea cup and told one of the workers. No reaction or apology. She just switched our cups. The food itself tasted horrible and was barely even lukewarm. They must've also reused the oil in most of the dishes, as you could taste it. You should definitely only come here if it's the last dim sum place in the world. Actually, not even for that."}
{"text":"Haven't had dimsum in a long while and thought of East Ocean right away. It had always left a good impression on me for being clean, spacious, tastefully decorated and the food is good. I keep forgetting about the price! It's Sunday, around 2pm, and there's just the two of us. I counted 11 stamps on our ticket for dimsum, and sure enough, we paid $55. Granted, a pot of tea for a $1 was included on that tab. For 3 piece dimsum, (didn't it used to be 4, even 5?)  $5 is expensive. Maybe that's why there's fewer people patronizing it even on a Sunday. I know I'll pick it as a last resort."}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the past. Today the food was terrible. The choices were limited. Most of the entrees were cold or lukewarm. The sweet tofu was thick and sticky and lacking syrup. The buns were dry. Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Woodrow at Yelp HQ advised me that my first review of this place was in violation of guidelines due to lacking first hand experience so here is my second review to clarify that it was indeed a....first hand experience.

So the GF and I were in the area of Eastern & St. Rose and were looking at trying something new.  I fired up the Yelp application on my cell phone and began looking for something to eat.  EODS&SR popped up and so having never had Dim Sum we decided to give it a shot.

We pulled into the parking lot and exited our vehicle.  I then opened the door for my GF as she stepped inside the restaurant and I followed.

We were then seated at a table and both given menus.  We ordered water to start as we perused the menu looking for something to eat.  I also checked into the restaurant via the check-in feature on the Yelp app.

While reading the menu I noticed that they serve SHARK FIN SOUP.  Having at that time recently learned of shark finning on Shark Week I knew that we would have no part of it.  Yao Ming the former basketball star did a service announcement protesting the practice.

The GF and I then decided to politely leave and we exited the building."}
{"text":"If you live or work within the Henderson area, this is not a bad place for Dim Sum, especially if you want to avoid having to drive to Chinatown. Price is comparable, taste is good however it lacks variety. If you like the pineapple bun, order it upon seating so it will be ready by the time you are ready for dessert. It's clean and not greasy. My favorite thing there is one of the servers who speaks English really well and Spanish who thinks she owns the restaurant (or at least she tells me that). She is fun and entertaining at the same time."}
{"text":"How cool is it to have a dim sum place on your neighborhood?  Decent price point, tasty plates, and most importantly delish pork buns.

My only criticism was that some of the dishes, like the noodles, we're at room temp - even slightly cool.  In their defense we showed up after 12 PM, so the dishes had meandered through the dining room a few times.

I'm sticking by my 4 stars - not because the quality is the best I've had, but because it's pretty good and I love having a dim sum place close by (even though my oldest son goes so often they know his name)."}
{"text":"It was okay. As soon as we hit the door they were trying to pawn off the cold trays and it was a tad overwhelming. I do not like the fact they offer Shark Fin soup and because of that I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This was our first Dim Sum dining experience.  I didn't know what to expect but I've been wanting to try it since we moved here.  

We walked in towards the end of lunch hours.  We were greeted and seated right away.  Yes, we were the only ones in there.  I think this worked to our advantage though.  Being it was our first time, she gladly explained how everything worked.  She said dim dum is appetizers.   You pick from the cart that comes by the table.  What I like is that your food is done already with in waiting.  

The down side to this is you don't know the names of what you are getting and how long they have been on the cart.  Unfortunately I chose to try some calamari.  That was probably the most dry and overdone calamari I've ever had.   On the bright side, I had some pretty tasty siu Mai and har gow.  I only knew the names because someone else had posted it.  

I love the format of the dim sum restaurant.  The service here was friendly and very attentive.  I say it's a strong 3.5!"}
{"text":"Here's our newest dim sum find in Vegas and they were suprisingly delicious!  Our go to used to be Ping Pang Pong in the Gold Coast because it was the best among mediocre Vegas dim sum.  Now East Ocean Dim Sum, a gem over in Henderson, is the much better option.  Textures were chewy when it was supposed to be chewy, crunchy when supposed to be crunchy and mmmmmmm flaky and buttery when supposed to be flaky...... mmmmmmm

It offers the surprisingly tasty dim sum, helpful staff in a large and seemingly clean restaurant, AND the bonus is that it is smoke free.

Conclusion:  It is a 30 minute drive across town for me, but I will travel to eat."}
{"text":"Been here twice, both times were really good! Servers are attentive and really nice.
Had war wonton soup, orange chicken & baby bok choy. Chicken is amazing! Crisp outside and the flavor isn't too sweet. Bok choy was good, and wonton soup is always awesome, add some soy sauce, perfect!"}
{"text":"Even though we arrived towards the last half hour of lunch/dim sum hours, there was  still a few good choices of steamed and deep fried delicacies to choose from.  My husband always thought dim sum was a food item. Didn't realized their is no menu involved. So he was a little surprised the second we sat down we were bombarded with  ladies and their carts and me just pointing out I want that, that & that ...then another lady with her cart full of the fried fare rolls up to our table and I drool and  point out to 3 more plates.   I think we had 6 different plates within the 5 minutes of being there.  The servers stamped our ticket of what plates we chose and went off to the next table...\"That's Dim Sum, little plates of food served up by servers pushing the carts, and that's how they roll honey!\" I tell my husband. \"But  where's the fried rice??\"  Mr. B asked ..Since we got there late, all of the steamed BBQ rice was gone, so we ordered a platter of BBQ pork fried rice separately.

Food: Everything we tried did not disappoint! In fact the food cooked up here is reminiscent of traditional Cantonese cuisine I used to enjoy! It takes me back to dining in SF Chinatown.

I'll zero in my fave classic The Char Siu Bao (steamed pork buns) the bread was so soft & fluffy and sweet!  The filling  plentiful of very tender bbq pork in a slightly sweet sauce.  Same with the baked Char Siu/Siopao.  Also pretty impressed with the Beef Fried Rice.   The flavors of the green onions,garlic, Chinese spices and texture of it being lighter, fluffy,  not greasy  just made fried rice stand out from other places.  Everything we had from the cart was hot, steam coming from the steamed baskets.  Dishes we requested were fresh, cooked to order.  

Ambiance - Interior decor had contemporary feel with the airy open ceiling.  Banquette seating on side walls and table seating for 4 & 8 throughout or they can arrange seating to accommodate larger parties. 

Service - On point. Friendly.  Was greeted & seated right away. The ladies pushing the carts were really sweet and patient with us since we had lots of \"what's that?\" questions. Never had to ask for a drink refill or teapot refill. The owner came by and introduced himself and chatted with us as well. 

So making this spot our Chinese go to dine out here in Henderson.  And the next visit we'll defiantly come earlier to chow down."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food,  regular menu and dim sum are both really good !!! Try the sticky rice wrapped in the leaf, it's off the dim sum menu,  one of my favZ !!!"}
{"text":"Feel sorry for the owner of this dim sum place. This place is so empty. Maybe chef  has to start loving his job again. Probably he gave up and has no satisfaction anymore. Customers will come back up. Cheer up. Service was excellent, food was good too. Give it a try guys, food wasn't bad at all. ps...I am not a dim sum expert. But I like good food. And my belly feels happy."}
{"text":"If you want legitimate dim sum and prices that are REASONABLE, do NOT come here. 1. What dim sum place doesn't have fried taro? 2. The steamed pork (shui mai) and steamed shrimp (har gow) come in 3s! At all dim sum places they're supposed to come in 4s! Especially at the price range of 3.50-3.95, they're making a killing and ripping off vacationers! 3. The chicken feet were small and tasted rancid, we didn't even finish that and left it. 4. They open at 10:30am, we got there at 11am and ordered a bbq pork pastry. We thought that was one of the few times that tasted decent and wanted another one- the lady said they \"sold out\". There was only 1 plate of it on the cart which we took... How do you sell out when the place is basically empty and you've been open for only 30 mins?? 5. Then selection of food was below average and we didn't each much. Our bill was still expensive and had we eaten at a different dim sum restaurant, we would have had an extra 4 dishes. To top this all off the cashier charged us an extra dish which we found before we paid. Unfortunately we didn't realize until we already left that they had also billed us for another dish we never even ordered. 

Overall, food was average, but prices were high- equivalent to eating dim sum at one of the hotels. Service was mediocre. You have been warned, eat there if you dare. If you're really wanting some delicious dim sum that is reasonably priced, then go eat at Chang's Hong Kong. It's conveniently placed within the Chinatown proximity. Food is great and the level of service is high- esp for a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I last ate at East Ocean about six years ago when it was under different management. At that time, calling it mediocre would've been generous. However I heard that it improved dramatically once the management changed and I've been meaning to try it ever since. 
There is a fairly large bar area on one side of the restaurant. It has three TV screens going. The restaurant dining area is also pretty large. The hostess left me a laminated card with photos and the names of the dim sum offerings. Almost immediately after I was seated, a server came by with hot tea and water. Less than 3 minutes later, a server came around with a rolling cart of Dim Sum choices. I opted for the stuffed mushrooms, pork siu mai, and pork bao. The stuffed mushrooms and the siu mai were quite good. The bao was outstanding - sweet and sticky, just the way I like them. The manager came by a few minutes later just to make sure everything was going well (a major plus when the manager makes the rounds to ensure good service and food quality).
Overall, tasty food, fast service (not rushed), and free wifi. An excellent lunch choice."}
{"text":"Good solid dim sum in hendertucky/GV area.  I've dined here a number of times and have not been disappointed...Pretty much straight forward fare and the items items that the suburban-set avoid are also welcome...good tripe, excellant tendon, cripsy fish and they have jellyfish.  Roast Pork w/ crispy skin is also better than average (maybe they get it from Sam Woo?).  Basics like hargow, sui mei, etc are solid representatoins that are mostly as good as what you'd get in Chinatown...This is now my go-to place...saves me the trip out to Sping Mtn Road...One plus - the service here is a bit better than what you'd find in a typical chinatown dim sum joint - maybe playing to the area clientelle?...also, the Chef visited our table the last 2x we dined here - a nice touch that you almost never ever see in Chinatown or anywhere in town for that matter...

Oh...and for those that have downgraded this place due to the sharks fin soup...get a grip.  You live in a freakin desert and have bigger problems to worry about...so unless you ride a bike to work, eat a local/sustainable diet (not possible in the LV Valley) live off solar and reclaimed water give us all a break or move to berkeley...sharks fin soup is delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty decent dim sum. But not as good if compared to bay area and socal dim sum restaurants. PingPangPong is the best dimsum you can get in the city."}
{"text":"How in the world has this place been voted Best in Vegas?!?! Waited longer than two meals that look like they came out of a frozen bag warranted. Overpriced and offensively average. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Nomally I don't like too much sauce on each dish but this place's sauce is different as others. I love it!
Fresh meat/seafood with yummy sauce. 
Great price for these dishes.
Perfect!!! I appreciate that this restaurant was open for Thanks giving night  in 2012."}
{"text":"Best-kept neighborhood treasure! Good food, plenty of room, great service, and so close to home! Will definitely make more visits here! Dim sum is pretty good, too!"}
{"text":"Thought we were stopping to eat at East Ocean Dim Sum. 
Now under a new name, Asia Palace, same owners. 
Even though the name is different the food was delicious. Three of us shared the Wor Wonton soup. This soup was so delicious!
We also shared the Shrimp with Lobster sauce, moo shoo chicken and a vegetable dish with very flavorful Boc Choy and mushrooms in a brown sauce. 
Our waiter Tucker was attentive and did a great job in conversing while cleaning off our table. Really nice guy!
By the way. Dim Sum is still available from 10 a.m. til 3 during lunchtime.
Please don't let the name change keep you from this great restaurant!"}
{"text":"It's quite unfortunate that the food is good but the service is terrible.  

Had dinner there on a night where less than 50% of the tables were full and yet it took over 2.5 hours for us to finish a complete meal - the service was ridiculously slow and the waiters would get dishes ordered confused.  When we asked to have the tables cleared for dessert, it took so long that we ended up cleaning up our own plates!!!!!  

Again, food was good but not worth the waste of time waiting for poor service."}
{"text":"First of all the ambiance has a lot to do with this rating. Please continue with the playlist! We are on Main Street jams- kick, punches, and bullets, baby. Nuff said. The food was also delicious and scrumptious. This family dinner was presenting with our order of a Peking Duck, Beef broccoli, Honey Walnut Shrimp (generous portion), Kung Pao Chicken, and Salt and Pepper Pork chop. Staff was attentive and friendly, my girl Grill and Red Umbrella  was on point and ready to serve. I also heard the Dim Sum on Sunday's is an amazing occasion."}
{"text":"Solid dim sum. Pan fried green dumplings are my favorite. Modern atmosphere which some don't like but I love the food."}
{"text":"It has been years since my girl and I had dim sum but it was worth the wait when we walked into East Ocean. Sat right away and a cart showed up. As I made my selection the tea arrived and it just got better from there. We found this restaurant by accident and will become regulars. Any food we got was wonderful. I graduate in June, guess where we're going"}
{"text":"I always thought this place was a buffet. It's not. I was taking my daughter to lunch. Her break is 10:30 - 11:30 and I was looking for something close to her work.  All the restaurants in the area opened at 11:00. I was pleased to see that East Ocean opened at 10:30. I always check Yelp first and the reviews were mixed. Anyway I thought I'd give them a shot. I'm glad I did because the food is amazing. We both had the walnut shrimp. The lunch special comes with a choice of soup ( egg drop soup was the best I EVER had).  The presentation of the food is beautiful.  Price was what you'd pay at Panda $8.95. Service was a bit slow to start but overall excellent. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for dim sum and it is the best dim sum I had in the southeast.  But that isnt saying much.

Just came in on Sunday afternoon to maybe grab some dimsum and the restaurant was empty besides one other table.  They asked us if we were eating dimsum or ordering off the menu.  We told them we would be doing both.

We grabbed a few of the dimsum items and you can immediately tell that they have been sitting out for a long time and felt tough. So we thought we would try the hot pot and ordered the specialty hot pot that had a mix of ingredients in it.  That was very disappointing and we didnt even end up finishing it.

All in all i would recommend coming here during busy hours so the dimsum can be a bit more fresh."}
{"text":"I also don't understand the poor reviews.  I've never had a bad experience.  Yes they bring around the carts rapidly and it can be a bit overwhelming but I've experienced this at every dim sum place I've ever been to.  If you prefer a more leisurely pace, just let them know, they will accommodate.   Large clean dining room with friendly, attentive, though somewhat business-like staff.   No, they don't show the prices when you're ordering so you have to take a bit of a leap of faith in this regard, but the prices are very reasonable and I have never been unhappy with my bill.   I've never had a problem with the English either, though it isn't the first language for many of the servers.   Try it for lunch as by dinner time the selection is reduced.  

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I can still remember what we've ordered since we dined not too long ago and these are pork & shrimp siu mais, pork bun, chicken feet, pork ribs and two sides of rice. As you can see we just ordered less at first as we are planning to order more. but that idea changed as these less-complicated-food-to-serve (as they are already prepared and steamed to stay fresh as we all believed) came too long. We waited as if they just started preparing everything and no one even have the balls to tell us that it will take too long. There are only 3 tables during that time, not even crowded enough to serve those food we ordered. Dim sum places I knew are usually crowded, this place is by far the quietest. To end this review, their lobby smells paint and I can still smell it until we get to our table."}
{"text":"rice wrapped in leaf not good. siu mai disappointing. cocktail bun with coconut filling not fresh. bread was hard"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile, but I recently passed by and looks like they rebranded or is under new management since the restaurant is now called Asia Palace."}
{"text":"I have had dim sum in New York. In Los Angeles. In san Francisco.  East Ocean's dim sum can compete with the best of them. I often times have my 200 lb. Service dog with me. They ALWAYS treat he and i like treasured guests. I'm beginning to think that those folks who write poor reviews about their serivce, back pedal a moment and possibly adjust their attitude. I have a dear friend coming into tiwn from Hawaii....his request? Can we please go to East Ocean from the airport! Well of course........just sayin"}
{"text":"I thought maybe this was somehow affiliated with East Ocean in the CA Bay Area but it isn't, or at least I don't think it is because the one in CA is delicious and this was NOT. The dim sum was not very good. Bland, seemed like reheated frozen dim sum. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Fast service... came in for dim sum 
I didn't have to wait for the cart...they ask what I wanted and brought it down to our table goodah"}
{"text":"We dropped by on a Sunday around noon. Frankly, I wasn't expecting much, but we didn't feel like driving all the way to the other side of town. We decided to give them a chance.

And unfortunately our low expectations were not exceeded. Their dim sum tastes and feels like it's been sitting around for too long. Even when reheated the food is too oily and the textures are unappetizing.

All of which is unfortunate. The service is very good and they all seem like very nice people. They are the only dim sum restaurant on this side of town and should be super busy. But it's clear why they aren't. I wish they would just do their dim sum made-to-order so that it's fresh.

So, if you REALLY don't want to drive to the other side of town for dim sum, I'd suggest eating something else. But if you REALLY REALLY want dim sum AND you REALLY don't want to drive to the other side of town, well, eat here. It'll be okay, but you'd probably happier eating something else."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum this past weekend.  Definitely different from the normal \"China town\" dim sum spots I've been too. The restaurant is fairly large so we were seated right away, even though they were actually quite busy. First thing I noticed was how modern and clean the place was, always a plus. The carts came around right away and the selection was great. Wasn't all the typical dumplings, steamed (3 peices) dishes.  There was actually alot I wanted to try but didn't get the chance to. 

Definitely liked the duck, shrimp, egg custard filled and BBQ pork filled buns. I had asked for a particular dish 3 times, they kept saying it would be out but it never came. I finally asked a last time before we left and asked for it to go, didn't realize till I got home and opened the to go box how tiny the item was compared to other dim sum restaurants. Nonetheless, it was still delicious. 

Only downfall was the extremely rude cashier at the end. Good thing our experience with her was super short SNF on our way out."}
{"text":"This place is not good food is mediocre... such a disappointment!
 everything was too salty
  the pork buns were barely cooked and the actual bun was dry while the inside was still raw dough... I don't even know how that's possible. 
The actual restaurant was dingy and gloomy, with an empty ambience.
It looked like the food was sitting the carts for awhile. We went there after 7PM and dim sum was very limited; they barely had anything in the carts. 

Never coming back here again"}
{"text":"I have posted in the past about this place last year and gave it good reviews because it was good, and went this year to Las Vegas in June for 2 weeks and was looking forward to eat here again. To my dismay, the food has gotten worst,  our BBQ pork was brown and tasted old so sent it back the noodles that we loved seemed old and hard, and there was hardly any people in the restaurant, which is a bad sign.  We were disappointed.   Will not be coming back...."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times, the food is good, the portions are small because its dim sum. This time we went for my birthday lunch and ended up paying $80 for 4 adults, really??!! They charge you like dinner portions, $10 or 3 pieces of shrimp and small plate of noodles, they classify as \"large\", then they act like they can't read or speak English when  you're trying to ask about the charges on the receipt.  There are plenty of other Chinese / dim sum / buffet areas in Vegas. Definitely not coming back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place it's close to home. Very comparable to spring mountain area. With Dim Sum ... when your hungry the food comes fast. I always forget to take photos before I eat at this place. I have not tried dinner here yet only dim sum. The place is always busy, service is ok to good. Trying to flag a waiter down for soda for the kids once was pain. The selection is basic too ... but i think i am jilted and comparing it to dim sum places in California. Also don't come here when your on a diet :)"}
{"text":"Ordered honey walnut shrimp, and seafood claypot with steamed rice.
Great presentation
Great service
Great price
Clean dining room"}
{"text":"Dined in last Sunday afternoon (around 1PM) for some Dim Sum with my family. I don't know if it was an off day but the service and product was lacking big time. For starters the restaurant wasn't completely full yet there was a wait. I'm assuming they didn't have enough servers to seat all the tables. It took about 15 minutes before the first cart came around...  in the past they've came around within minutes of being seated. They were limited to only 3 carts an entree cart(BBQ pork, rice, noodles), apps cart (pot stickers etc) and a soup cart.  Not only was the selection very limited but the carts barely came around. We never got to order a second round and thought it wasn't worth waiting around all day so we left hungry and extremely unsatisfied. Top it off there was a line just to pay the check... really?  I might give them one more chance only because it's inconvenient to drive all the way to Chinatown just to get some dim sum."}
{"text":"I am Chinese. Why does that matter? I know my Chinese food. Sub standard food, but no joke, double the darn price!!!! Seriously, this place is so Americanized and expensive. Trust me, save 50% by going to Chinatown."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I really enjoy dim sum and I like the fact that they serve it all day. The thing that really gets me is the restrooms. 
You're a food establishment why wouldn't you have clean restrooms? I felt so grossed out I refused to ever eat here again. Come on people, REALLY?!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was delicious I'm never really had the styled dim sum , something different but yet unique...  I would definitely return this place for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Can I give 0 stars!! Wow, the service as well as the prices was ridiculous, and beware, if you say something you would get an attitude in return. First and last time here. Bahhhh!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has 3 stars. I'd give it zero if I could. 

The dim sum was absolutely disgusting. We ordered one of everything. It was all either cold and bland, or extremely hot and rubbery. I spit out my first bite and wouldn't touch the rest. 

If you're willing to spend 30 bucks on water and tea, go for it. Otherwise you're better off at Panda Express."}
{"text":"Over all pretty disappointing. 

3 stars is because at 1:45 on a Monday afternoon I could actually get dim sum. If I were to grade on food alone rating wouldn't be nearly that good. 

I love dim sum and I'm not all that picky. However, this restaurant was pretty lousy. I hate to say that because staff was friendly and I like to support family owned non chain businesses. The scary thing is outside of California and New York most of it is just bought and reheated, and I still enjoy most of it. 

Steamed pork buns - as someone else said. . . They tasted as if covered with too much water and microwaved. The bun was gummy and not very good. 

Hot and sour soup - was not hot or sour. Was just bland. 

Shrimp won tons - I love them everywhere and very consistent from restaurant to restaurant. 

Pork ribs - probably best plate I had. 

Shrimp green pepper - I only ate one. They were awful

BBQ pork - was fine. Overly dry and too much syrup. I find this pretty typical at most places. 

Unfortunately, I just don't see me going back. I was so excited to find a dim sum place in Henderson serving all day. Just disappointed with the food. I will admit the younger girl who re-filled my diet coke was very sweet. I'm used to unfriendly service at Chinese restaurants, which never bothers me. However, it was a pleasant change to get friendly service."}
{"text":"The place was roomy, decor was cute and wait staff attentative and nice. 

The dim sum was not so good, unfortunately. 

Also check your final bill, as they are not that busy, so not all the food was parading  around the cart, so we have to order from the waiter, but they never brought it, yet it was on our final bill.
Easy mistake, I guess. 
Would gladly go back if the food was a little better, but better off just making the drive to China Town."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend so we decided to try it out.

Arrived a little after they opened. The place was big, nicely decorated. The restrooms were clean.

The food was great! We had dim sum and some Chinese dishes. The food on the carts were hot, just freshly cooked. 

We'll definitely be back and will recommend this place to our family and friends."}
{"text":"Bland af. Their siu mai, wonton soup, hot and sour soup, shrimp noodle, and fried shrimp wonton were bland and def wasn't worth what they're priced at. Horrible dim sum."}
{"text":"Perfectly decent dim sum given the location. Yes, it's far from the best dim sum I've ever had, but it's also not horrendous  either. It's an authentic, if a bit generic, Cantonese experience, and in my case I could communicate with the servers in their own language. That having been said, most speak English just fine, and appear to have a strong rapport with many locals, so if you're not of Chinese descent, don't be afraid to be adventurous and ask questions. Just be a bit patient.

Again, while there wasn't anything particularly memorable about the dim sum, it still does the job, and saves you the drive all the way to the San Gabriel Valley, let alone any other place in the Vegas area that might have better dim sum."}
{"text":"Ate here with my pops and bro. This place was a-ok, nothing out of the ordinary for dim sum. My dad met up with his friends from medical school, who live in Henderson. They said this place is usually packed. I think the only reason it wasn't packed was because we went on Super Bowl Sunday. BBQ pork bun was yummers as were the noodles. 

Would I visit again? Maybe."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was immediately seated. 

Hostess showed me the lunch specials, but I was there for Dim Sum! 

Had the usuals, BBQ pork bun, Shu Mai, and Shrimp dumplings. I would have ordered more, but when it just you, that was plenty. I do wish the servers would explain more of the items on their carts. I am adventurous eater and love to try new things, but it was difficult to understand what some of the dishes contained. 

Its great to have a place on the southeast side for dim sum. Looking forward to going back with friends and trying more.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants here in Vegas...I usually come here once every two weeks or so. The dim sum I find to be ok, nothing special...I think the dim sum dishes taste a tad better at Chang's on Decatur. I love the Pan fried noodles here at East ocean--they don't put too much sauce so the noodles stay crispy...most places flood the dish with sauce, like Cafe noodle in Chinatown. Also tried the chicken lettuce cups last week, and liked them. The beef tenderloin with black pepper is pretty good, and I usually order that. The fried rice with chicken and salted fish is good here too, as they don't cut the salted fish into big chunks so there is an explosion of salt in your mouth. Also tried the wonton noodle soup with roasted duck as a appetizer soup and that was decent as well. I also love the fried stuffed tofu as well. If I am not completely stuffed after eating here, I go across the street to Nielsen's!!"}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE DIM SUM IN VEGAS.  ITS THE SAME AS CHANGS ON DECATUR!  Now its minutes from my house.  I love it.  Much more spacious in this location.  Great service and favorite dim sums are consistent and continue to taste good.  Wish their fried wings were out more.  So good."}
{"text":"This is really good chinese food especially for the east side of town finally i dont have to go all the way to china town for good food!! prices are reasonable and staff is friendly. decor is nicer than typical chinese joint. feels more high class but not high class pricing. highly reccomended"}
{"text":"We have been here three times and they are OK to get your Dim Sum Fix in. Each time we end up over-ordering because it is a order and prepare Dim Sum restaurant and we get too excited ordering at once versus pulling from a Dim Sum cart. On the most recent visit with them it was not busy at all and the quality of the dumplings was a little off. The Sui Mi was a little dry on the edges and a lot of the dumplings prepared with rice flour wraps were not sealed well. Prices were a lot higher than other places in Vegas with better Dim Sum. Not sure if I would come back, or if time allowed then go to Dim Sum Cafe or Orchids Garden."}
{"text":"I ate here recently with a couple of friends.  We had some dimsum items from the menu which were average.  However, the dishes were splendid.  Asparagus with scallops was outstanding!  So were the string beans and the sea bass.  The veggies were lightly cooked and crisp, and the fish was soft and moist.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went for dim sum and were very disappointed. The food was not good, and the service was even worse. When we asked questions, they were rude and annoyed that we didn't know what everything on the menu was. They also brought us tea, which we did not order. We didn't drink any and they still charged us for it. Will definitely not be returning here."}
{"text":"It was good. I had the Lemon Chicken and the Mongolian Beef. They are remodeling the bar, which should be completed in a couple of weeks. I really was craving Sweet & Sour Chicken, but they don't serve it there, only Sweet & Sour Shrimp, & I thought that was really odd."}
{"text":"We have eaten Dim Sum all over Southern California and believe me there are a lot of authentic restaurants there. Orange County is like another Asian country. (not complaining!)  Tried a place in Vegas and it was really not good but had a REALLY good experience at East Ocean. The staff was very helpful and attentive. The food was also really good. Until something else comes up, this is my local place for Dim Sum. Have already recommended it to others."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice in the past month and both times have been positive experiences. The interior is very spacious and spread out so you will never feel crowded. The staff is very friendly and helpful with any questions you may have about the menu. The dim sum taste very fresh. I usually order a regular menu item, such as BBQ pork chow mien, and 2 dim sums. The orange chicken is some of the best I have ever had and I highly recommend trying it. Overall 5 stars!"}
{"text":"First time visiting.  Food was great.  Service was ok.  Loved the green tea and the potstickers rocked my socks."}
{"text":"The decor here is something from the 1990's. Very outdated. Anyway, I came here during dinner time, around 7:30, I kid you not, I was the only person here. At first, I wanted to leave because that's a bad sign, especially when the plaza is so busy, but I decided to still give it a try. The lady taking my order didn't speak a lick of English. Half the things on their dim sum menu, they didn't have. Seriously, there are way better dim sum places out there. Don't waste your money here. I didn't get sick or anything, but everything I had seemed really really old and cheaply made."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Mediocre food. Rude staff. The only shining light were the two, cute, older gentlemen playing piano and singing which provided live music. We were virtually the only people there at 6:30 on a Friday night, that should tell you something. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This review covers the dim sum only.  Upon walking into the restaurant, expectations were high since the decor is notably more modern than the usual Chinese restaurant ambience and currently residing in Henderson, I was optimistic towards the prospect of a decent dim sum joint without having to make the trek towards Spring Mountain.  From start to finish, I'd have to say the quality of the dim sum was consistently meh.  My mom, dad, and sister joined me and I found it problematic that each dish had some undeniable flaw that found all four of us consistently in unanimous agreement.   

Temperature: a marker of good quality (and signs of active turnover) is how hot the dishes are when they arrive at your table.  Virtually every dish was room temperature on arrival, and even after we requested a fresh one or that they reheat a dish, it came back lukewarm at best.  

Texture: The daikon cakes were gelatinous and missing the crispy edges, the long flat rice noodle filled with shrimp were overcooked, and the shrimp dumplings (the benchmark for dim sum) had skins that were gummy.  Even the salt and pepper squid (pretty much a staple at any Chinese restaurant) was coated in a dark brown batter that resembled the KFC extra crispy batter rather than the air-y tempura batter that barely coats the the natural contours of the squid pieces.

Service: My sister and I had a recent discussion regarding the rise of Korean and Japanese cuisine in the states and the relative stagnation of Chinese food.  One of the things which are done well in the former two is service and it's almost an anticipated assumption that any decent Chinese restaurant will have either rude servers or mismatched silverware/plates since as a cultural whole, neatness and courtesy are not heavily emphasized as you would normally expect when walking into a Korean/Japanese restaurant.  Folks here seem apathetic and inattentive, which is all the more surprisingly considering the grand opening was within the past few weeks.

My mother, who usually can be quite forgiving towards Chinese food, summed it up best (paraphrased from Chinese):

\"If our friends ever invite us to this place, I will probably have to make up some excuse for our unavailability so as to avoid coming back\"

There's dim sum, and then some....and this is definitely the latter."}
{"text":"This dim sum restaurant was just ok especially if you want to save yourself a drive to Chinatown. The prices were ok, but I've definitely seen cheaper and better tasting ones elsewhere. The food was great but there wasn't that many options. They serve dim sum all day long, but if you come around dinner time, your options are limited. The place itself was very clean; they played a lot of old school music. The only thing that was slightly disappointing was our service, our server was a little pushy and most of the time we sat around waiting for her to come around to serve us our food as she sat in a table and chatted with her colleagues."}
{"text":"It was a nice change of peace.  


Went out to have a nice dinner with the family.  Turned out we will be coming back for Dim Sum.  The dinner menu that they have is very flavorful and they do take walk-ins and around 5:30 - 6 pm they are not really packed for service.  This is nice.  You walk in a get a table and hot tea.  Ok so service was on point from the start.  The owner is walking around making sure that everything is to your liking.  That is nice.  Most restaurants you have to hunt down the Manager.  The first course arrived.  Pot stickers and crispy shrimp balls.  Very tasty and the sauce that comes with both are a little different but still good.  Then the main course comes out family style which are very nice when you want to try everything.  We ordered the Rock Cod with Baby Bok Choy, Curry Fried Rice (with a fried egg and an eggroll), Chicken with schezwan sauce (needed more chicken), and honey walnut shrimp.  Needless to say all this for only 60 bucks is not a bad upscale Chinese food.  

Overall -

Service - nice and friendly
Food - Flavorful and good portions
Quality - Not to bad - decent
Price - Average for upscale restaurant

 
This is a formal restaurant with proper Chinese table service.  

Would I go Back -    Yes"}
{"text":"Dim sum here is bomb!!!! Reminds me of our old dim sum haunts in Atlanta. Not sure why they're only at 3 stars but my experience here was excellent!! Authentic Chinese food and attentive staff!"}
{"text":"Went here and they kept adding on food we didn't pick, we had to watch them place food on our table just in case they wpuld add quantity like the hot tea we didn't want they just placed it on our table and was gonna charge us for it. When it came time to pay they wrote their own tip amount on the check And expected us to just sign off on it."}
{"text":"We wanted to get some dim sum but didn't want to drive to Chinatown. When we got into the restaurant there was somebody playing keyboards music and it felt like we were in an 80s movie. The dishes were in the carts and they were nice and hot. At first I was excited that we lived so close to a good dimsum place. However after a few bites of everything we got (suimai, meat ball, turnip cake, spare ribs) I felt kind of gross because everything was super greasy, like dripping oil greasy. Even the egg tart was really greasy. Next time we'll drive a little farther for dim sum..."}
{"text":"I love dimsum. It's my comfort food, we usually come here every sunday for lunch so we're used to the carts, but tonight was different, no carts but a looooong long wait for the server to take our orders. They need to train their people, and have that good system to keep on taking orders and serving food. But the food was awesome"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and the food was great! I've been to other dim sum places, but this one seemed significantly bigger, cleaner, and overall better. The manager was nice enough to talk to us about the new improvements to the establishment. Excited for the new things to come from this restaurant! Unfortunately, they ran out of pork buns, but the hospitality of the staff made up for it."}
{"text":"Dinner menu-- not bad for chinese restraurant near my area. The food serving was decent except for the salt and pepper calamari (I can count how many were there in the plate). The taste of the food is pretty good, it has a lot of flavors and aroma. The price of the food is a little expensive but you don't have to drive all the way to chinatown to eat decent chinese food. I would come to this place again!"}
{"text":"This place got a bad rap! I'm happy that Yelp let me down for once. The 3 star rating didn't deter me from trying it out and I'm glad it didn't. This restaurant is so much closer to our home in Henderson, and we didn't want to drive out to Spring Mountain Road so we gave it a shot. They had great dim sum at a good price. My only complaint was that some of the items weren't piping hot, but the flavors and presentation was good. The restaurant was clean, and there was no wait at 11 a.m. on a Saturday morning. We will definitely be back many many times!"}
{"text":"We came for dim sum on Saturday right when they opened at 10 a.m. so we were seated right away.  We had 10 people (5 adults and 5 kids under 7 years old).  The food was pretty good.  My favorite was probably their green beans (not a dim sum dish).  The restaurant was nicely decorated and clean.  The food carts came right away so we were able to get most of the items we wanted but for dessert, we wanted dan ta (egg custard pastry).  We asked a couple of ladies and they said it was coming and then someone said they were still baking so we waited about 15 more minutes.  They came out piping hot and were worth the wait.

After we ate, we wanted to pay and leave but no one came by for the longest time so we had to flag someone down.  Once the bill came, we noticed they charged 50 cents per person for tea, including the kids!!  what kid drinks hot tea?  so annoying.  They took our credit cards and didn't bring them back for the longest time so my friend had to go to the counter to get the bill so we could sign.  We wanted to give them less tip since everything was taking so long but guess what?  They automatically added tip to our bills!  probably because we had 10 people.  The meal started off well but ended badly.  We'll try another dim sum place next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is okay, service stinks. Left here hungry 2 times now. Manager is clueless, staff poorly trained. Never busy, no wait on weekends or peak times. Wonder why."}
{"text":"Keep your expectations in check, but do take a leap of faith on the quality of the food. 

We ate there on Xmas Eve. It was quite empty. Our orders were promptly taken and delivered at the right time, but they didn't check back and ask if we needed anything like another glass of wine. The dirty dishes sat on the table way too long. We had to ask for them to be removed.

The food was great, but you couldn't tell much about it from the menu descriptions, which are very short and not descriptive enough. I ordered scallops with asparagus. There was no description of the sauce or anything. I asked the waiter and she added the bare minimum details. It was delicious, though, with garlic and ginger flavoring.

We also had beef with broccoli, which was a large portion with a brown gravy that was a little too sweet. The beef was tender and broccoli steamed just right.

The room could use a good going over. The white cloth chairs are somewhat dirty, and the Coke labeled machine at the bar needs to go out of eyesight.
I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Food is great, when I went to orchid gardens I thought it was too salty for my taste but here at Eastern Dim sum it was great! Fast service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Two friends and I had lunch here today and as usual it was a five star lunch but somehow today the  dim sum offerings seemed much better than ever.
Can't tell you everything we had because I don't remember what they're called but I can remember the incredible barbecue pork stuffed baos. If you've never had one you need to try them because you will be as hooked as we are on these hamburger-bun-looking gems. The sesame balls stuffed with plum sauce are sheer heaven. The pineapple crusted custard stuffed buns melted in your mouth.. But for those of you who come from the Midwest, Michigan in particular as I do, the plateful of fried smelt is something that would bring  me back again.  
The three of us shared about eight different dishes and not a bad one among them. The shrimp fried rice was especially good. This is definitely one of the best dim sum places I have ever been and we will go back as we always do.
Thanks to manager Dermot who came to our table and made sure that everything was all right. It was!!
He's a very gracious man and treated us well.
Lunchtime here is extremely busy and as large as this place is there were a few tables available so get there early if you go on Sunday. Just get there!!!"}
{"text":"Walked into this huge dining hall, clean and spacious but geez...Food is mediocre!
Dimsum is one of my favorite go to for savory dumplings and I have been to many but this place was a huge disappointment! 
You are welcomed by a loud, friendly, lady with a cart full of dishes in bigger plates pushing you to try them. The minute you point on a dish, she starts selling it to you
and it ends up on your table. We had 3 plates that cost us 9.50/plate, so we found out when she rolled away with a big sign saying \"@9.50\"
She definitely pulled a good one there!
Dimsum cost at least 2.75 to 3:50/plate
but these carts did not come rolling towards us after the fact.

CONS:Bbq pork plate 9.50 was tough and unseasoned, honey was the only flavor that was at the bottom of the pork slices.
             Fried chicken wings 9.50 had an after taste of Chinese seasoning powder.
              Fried rice @9:50 was forgettable.
The most expensive fried rice I've ever had with the most generic taste ever, with no meat and uses the smallest and cheapest shrimp.
               Dimsum was typical nothing special dumplings.
EXPENSIVE for what??? They can charge 
the price they are charging if the food equals the $$$  Spent $65 on  a $25/meal.
PROS: clean dining hall, great location.
Don't waste your dollars, go to Chinatown folks..."}
{"text":"The dim sum was okay it's better earlier in the day. However watch out if you order dishes off the menu because our vegetable dish was $14 for an plate of dou miou and we weren't expecting that. The two of us ended up spending $50 for okay quality food. The salty fish and chicken fried rice barely had any fish and it felt like $12 for a big plate of rice. The flavor was acceptable though."}
{"text":"I come here ever so often for dim sum just because its close to where I live. However, I think this may be the last time I will be coming here for a very long while. I felt they try to push you to get everything in the carts. We constantly had to say, \"no, thank you.\" 

The food was good. Not something to say \"wow\" about. You definitely need to come later like 1pm to see a more varietal of dim sum. Certain dishes I normally get at dim sum places, here it seemed bland. The desserts were very good though. 

 I guess I was also a bit surprise with the bill being over $60 for three people. I've never known to pay so much for dim sum especially for three.

Overall, if you don't want to drive to Chinatown for dim sum, I guess you can come here or go next door to Hot n Juicy Crawfish ;)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised we didn't get food poisoning....the huge place was practically empty on a Saturday night. This would be a perfect Restaurant Impossible episode because the decor hasn't changed since the place opened. With so many options on Eastern, I'm definitely not interested in returning."}
{"text":"The sign outside says best of Las Vegas. 
No
Food sits on carts and is not fresh 
Expensive for what you get"}
{"text":"We used to adore this restaurant especially for dim sum. We returned with friends yesterday. It had changed its name to Asia Palace and the place fell apart. Service was terrible. Food was cold. My husband LOVES their bbq pork but this time it was too tough to eat. We commented as we paid but the host just said it was cut too thick. No refund or adjustment. We will never return. Too bad because it used to be so excellent!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the worst dim sum place I have been to in Las Vegas. The food, especially the shrimps, tasted like they have been washed with chmical. Everything tasted so far away from what the authentic dim sum suppose to be. As a Chinese immigrant, I felt bad for my American friends who think those are dim sum. The service was slow and it seemed like if you don't ask, they wouldn't  acknowledge that you have been seated for more than 10 minutes without a menu. I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"Horrible! Cart only came once. Our waitress left us. And there was only 1 other table besides us in the restaurant. We left and went next door to hot n juicy lol go to orchids!"}
{"text":"Great location in Henderson. It's good dim sum for the locals and the dinner entrees are all good. Try the salt and pepper chicken wings as an appetizer. YUMMY. I hope they make it. This space is so ginormous that most restaurants in this location struggle to make the place look busy. I think they should partition the room a little more to create some smaller, intimate dining areas.

Management has always been friendly and receptive. My family and I come here to eat at least 3 times a month so we're familiar faces to them. For a Chinese restaurant to have a smiling server.... wow. :)"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot if you're on that side of town looking for a decent dim sum fix.  They have plenty of seating and stellar service.  Be advised that they have a credit/ debit minimum that can really throw your dining party off if you don't pay attention to the tiny sign.

As for the grub - Char Siu Bao, Beef/ Shrimp Cheung fun, Lo Mai Gai and Shu Mai are always filling and Don Tot and Sesame Seed Balls for dessert!"}
{"text":"First off walking in the establishment, I see a green B and two red C's posted in the front counter (during the time of my visit). So that kind of makes me wonder. But anyways, the service isn't that great at all. I know dim sum restaurants typically don't have great service but this place blows them all out of the park. The food was bland and they offered to heat the noodle dish they served to us. They came back with it and it was still COLD. The fried squid was very mushy and tasted a little bitter. Dumplings were probably the best thing to eat there. Oh and you have to ask like 5 people to bring you rice. I wouldn't want to come back here."}
{"text":"Every time i go in with my wife or friends usually when they should be busy we be waiting there for 10-20 minutes and still with out any one checking on us to seat. We called for employees and we checked out to see if they were even accepting parties sometimes they were dead and they had no one at the Host stand. We Ate there once out of the 10 times we tried  The Food is good but Service just sucks"}
{"text":"Wow this place is good. Their dim sum ranks pretty close to what you get SF & NYC.
Service was spot on and the food was very fresh. We had a table of 8 and no one left hungry and unsatisfied.  The owner was very nice and was very hands on with take orders, delivering food and making sure everyone was happy. I would definitely come back when i'm in town."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place was named top 10 must try DIM SUM places in Las Vegas on Eater Las Vegas via Twitter....  Other than the fact that there are only a few selections to choose from in Las Vegas.  The restaurant is clean and service is friendly. Food is a bit over priced.  Almost $4 per dim sum plate. Food was okay. Every single dish we had was either lukewarm or cold.  We even ordered the shrimp rice rolls brought straight from the kitchen and it was early warm!  It was really disappointing and there was not a huge selection of dim sum options to choose from on a Friday early afternoon either.  The bbq pork was a disappointment (I should have listened to the other Yelp reviews); it looked like the Chinese bbq pork but it was just covered in honey lacking flavor.  The chow fun was a bit dry and hardly any flavor."}
{"text":"Dim sum is good. Lots of room and clean restaurant.  Dim sum selection is good but you only get three pieces to an order. Most dim sum places give you four. That's odd. Literally. The staff is nice, very authentic because they all speak Cantonese and kind of ignore you when you ask for extra water and condiments."}
{"text":"I really wish we had better dim sum alternative on this side of town. This is the only reason why I'll keep coming back, due to the convenience. It's okay. Service is lacking for sure."}
{"text":"Dim sum at a great location!  I like their a la carte menu too.  I've tried other dim sum places, and I think this is the best one in the valley.  They have a great variety.  I like their chinese broccoli, shrimp and pork dumplings, and noodle in soup with dumplings. 

 It's hard to find an authentic chinese restaurant that offers good simple noodle soup (with egg noodles), but this place has it.  I'm a fan of their wonton noodle soup.  Their wontons are like Sui Kai, which has shrimp and ground pork inside.


Their hong kong crispy chow mein is reasonably portioned (probably good for 3-4 people) are a reasonable price.  The quality and portions of their food are good.

Their duck is crisp and not fatty!  Roast duck at other chinese restaurants are often soggy and very fatty, but the skin of the duck at East Ocean is light and crisp.  Also, the meat is very tender.  

They offer ginger scallion crab as well.  I like the flavor, but it was difficult to eat.

Also what's new at this place is hot pot.  We got the seafood hot pot, and it is plenty for 3 people."}
{"text":"Dim sum is delicious but service sucks. Bottom line the quality of the food invites me back and if I can just go back to the kitchen and get it myself, I would give this place a 5 star.  Stay hungry Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and this is one of my top 3 dim sum places to go. I wish there were more restaurants out there that would seat you, pull up a cart of fresh and hot tiny trays of food so you can select 8 dishes and start chowing down in under a minute. What a wonderful world this would be.

Growing up in HI, particularly the island of Oahu, the original food truck for us is what we called the Manapua Man. I have tried to find a restaurant that is similar and has all my favorites, but I'm still on the hunt.  However, East Ocean Dim Sum & Seafood Restaurant checks off many of the boxes that help me feel at home.

Depending on the size of the \"dumpling\", there can be anywhere between 2 to 4-items on a tray. And the price ranging from $2.98 to $4.98. They also offer regular Chinese dishes that start at $6.00 and up. So be careful. Being snatch happy can end up being a really expensive lunch, but so worth it.

My all time favorites are the baked char siu bao (3 buns to a tray) @ $3.98 and the chow fun plate at $9.98.

Now there is the steamed char siu bao (white bun) and the baked char siu bao (brown bun). What I looooove about the baked char siu bao is the the honey coating on top.

This dim sum restaurant has a lot to offer and so many things that I don't even know. So be brave, be open and ask \"what's that\"? Give it a try. It won't kill ya.

East Ocean is bigger and feels cleaner than most other dim sum places making dining a little more pleasurable than other places.

4-star rating from me."}
{"text":"Okay...so we're still here while I'm writing this review.   Should I talk to the manager and say something about the deaf ladies pushing the dimsung carts?   It took about 15minutes before another cart would come around, one where we had to chase down and one that refused to even look our direction.   The food was bleh.   Had a plateful of fried rice that we didn't even bother to take out.   Place sucks.     

If only I could curse in a yelp review..."}
{"text":"I can't believe how horrible the service was here. The food was \"okay\". I should've stayed home and cooked. No smile. No one asked what we wanted to drink they just brought over hot tea and waters. When the ladies came around the cart how am I supposed to know what's being served if your not showing me. I don't know Chinese. I get it that the cart girls don't speak English but the server didn't come with a smile  honestly didn't say anything to me really and they weren't busy at all. There were 3 tables. Whats the point of going out to eat if  I'm not getting good service and ignored. NEVER COMING BACK HER AGAIN. Don't support this place it's awful."}
{"text":"Completely overrated!  This place was voted best Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas in the Review Journal.  I cannot fathom how this happened.  We waited forever for out food and the restaurant was not even a third full.  The lemon chicken was easily the worst that I've ever had.  I could barely cut it with a fork.  My fiancé had orange chicken and it was no better.  Both dishes were SO bland and had almost no flavor.  I would honestly rather eat at Panda Express than East Ocean.  Go to China Tango in Henderson if you want excellent Chinese food."}
{"text":"I used to eat here a lot.  It used to have the best Dim Sum this side of town.  The last time we went, it was less than spectacular.  I think they changed owners.  We ordered the table side Peking Duck.  That I still love, and it still tasted great.  The dim sum was rubbery and over cooked.  I was highly disappointed.  The service was the worst it has ever been.  I don't think I would be going back too soon."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since I enjoy going to Chang's for dim sum. Our experience started off good... My husband and I were seated right away even though it was a busy Sunday morning. The restaurant has a nice open layout. Then it was all downhill from there.

The tables are too close together and it's impossible for someone to walk by if there are carts in the walkway. We started off with some chow mein and roasted duck since the dim sum cart hadn't come by yet. Then roasted duck was cold, and when we asked the waitress if they could heat it up, she said that's how it's supposed to be served. Ookay... we let that go.

The dim sum carts finally came by and the selection was not nearly as much as Chang's. We were sad to not see any of our usual favorites. It seemed like the same three carts kept coming by.

What ticked me off more than the food was the service. We asked two people for water and finally got it after about half an hour. We had to flag down a waiter for our check.Two other tables near us were also complaining about not getting their check.  After waiting for about 15 minutes, my husband decided to go up to the cashier and ask if he could just pay up there. At first, the cashier said that he had to wait at the table for the check. Really?? We just wanted to pay. After more argument, the cashier let my husband pay. My husband checked the bill and saw that we were overcharged. He informed the cashier and the cashier said he would fix it, but when my husband checked the bill again it still wasn't corrected! So he just took the difference off of the tip.

Horrible customer service and mediocre food = me never going back."}
{"text":"From living near San Jose, and LA a time in my life, I love dim sum.  And the dim sum in both cities is out of this world.  So when I moved out to vegas I wanted some good dimsum.  I didn't want to drive down to spring mountain and this place is only a few minutes away from my house.  But it does hit the spot.  The service is a little slow, but the food is tasty.  They don't have all of the things I want, but overall for a dim sum place in henderson it is good.  Not the best but good."}
{"text":"not bad, food a bit bland.  ordered cashew chicken first time, they tried to pass off with tons of celery, carrots  and onions, so next time requested broccoli and carrots, but it was more veggies than chicken, tiny chicken pieces.  Veggie fried rice was bland."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place from a friend and she kept posting up pictures of food that looked very delicious so I had to come and try it out for myself. Being in the parking lot, I was already a little impressed because of how busy it was outside. However, when I went in, it wasn't that busy. Haha. We were seated very quickly and they fulfilled our request for a booth. 

The typical dim sum dining experience is that you are seated and there are a few ladies with food carts that come up to your table. They open the lids to their little pots and you just pick what you think will be good to eat. Be careful because they speak very minimal english, only enough to explain what the food is made of. Then they stamp your little paper stating what you had picked. So the more you pick, the more you pay! 

The thing that really annoyed me about this place was how pushy the food cart ladies were. I'm used to going to dim sum places where they just showcase what they have instead of just being really pushy about what I should eat. That was definitely a point down for me since they kept bringing out the wrong food as well. 

The second thing is that this place has decent dim sum but nothing extraordinary. The food wasn't as greasy as other dim sum places that I have tried. Just remember that they charge you for everything, the tea is $2. Haha. 

Since this place is closer to home and I dig the modern look, I will probably be coming here more often and making the occasional trek to treat myself at Cathay House. If you pay cash then you get 5% off of the total bill price. Dim sum is from 10:30A to 5:30P."}
{"text":"This is by far the best value and best taste authentic Chinese dim sum restaurant in the entire Vegas area.  I've tried many including those within the casinos and surrounding areas.  It's a bit far but is worth the time to travel.  All (especially Chinese) looking for delicious dim sum (fresh made and hot) don't look elsewhere come and try yourself then tell others."}
{"text":"This is an amazing, authentic Chinese Restaurant with an astounding variety of flavors, without using dreaded MSG!  We had the pepper beef, so tender and bursting with flavor that melted in our mouths. For a special occasion we also had whole main lobster with bean sauce, so fresh and savory. We finished with fresh fish with pineapple and peppers, accompanied with shrimp fried rice and Chinese broccoli, perfectly prepared. This is the best Chinese in the city, including Chinatown!"}
{"text":"We were headed to a Thai place nearby and decided to detour to Ocean Dim Sum. Glad we did. (Though we really like the Thai place also) 

My wife was unfamiliar with the practice of servers pushing trays of what is basically Chinese hor dourves, Dim Sum, around and offering it to us. We explained to the hostess that it was our first time there and could she tell us what Dim Sum was. She had the server bring over the cart with a lot of little metal bowls with 4 dumplings each in them  and explained what each item was. 

We each selected a different one. I ended up just eating Dim Sum and my wife ordered her Chinese staple, Kung Pao chicken. All told we ordered 6 different dim sum. The only disappointing one was the gyoza (pot stickers), they just had been sitting too long. Everything else was tasty. 

Very large inside with lots of seating. We went on Friday at 2pm and wide open. Hostess and servers were very nice. One of the servers with the cart was difficult to understand, but we just all laughed at the language difficulties. Not really an issue.

$35, not including tip. 
Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Its a great location for some dim sum action. Spacious, not too crowded, and you don't have to deal with rude chinese customers here like you do at Gold Coast, Cathay House, Etc.

They have a pretty good variety here, and all of the dim sum we got was piping hot. Another bonus is their mini manapuas and rice cakes...a little taste of home! Its a great alternative for locals who live in the area, and also for those who don't usually hit up Chinatown.

Stop in the next time you're in the area and want something other than your usual burger, pizza, or salad...ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Was super excited about going to EO today as it's a lot closer to my house than Chinatown and I was not disappointed.  My favorite, Har Gow, is probably the best in Las Vegas and rivals the dim sum houses in Chinatown, New York.

Authentic Dim sum experience with people wheeling the dishes around on carts and an extensive variety of dishes."}
{"text":"I like Chang's on Decatur but, I like this place WAY more. Mainly because it's cleaner and seems less hectic so you're able to get the dishes you want.
What's even more great is I found out that the owners of Chang's is, also, the owner of East Ocean."}
{"text":"Needing my Dim Sum fix I thought I'd reluctantly try East Ocean. Pleasantly surprised was I  !!! I loved the selections and the flavors were authentic. I also decided to try the dinners after that. Again pleasantly surprised. I would say it is the best Chinese food in the Las Vegas/Henderson area. Contrary to what another poster said our servers are more than helpful. I have decided to have my Dim Sum there at least twice a week and have dinner there at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I'm a little bummed out that they serve shark fin soup here (SAVE THE SHARKS!), but I did come anyway for dim sum as it was the closest place to eat with ready made servings to eat and pick from. I was starving, and was probably going to pass out in starvation if I waited any longer...

So I came for dim sum. I guess it's whats expected of dim sum since dim sum is more breakfast than lunch really. I came around 1 pm and they promote their dim sum until 3 pm I believe. However, I was really disappointed to come around 1 pm to find that more than half of their usual dim sum selections that they serve in the morning are not offered after 11 am. Most of what I craved for in dum sum were not being served so I was only able to eat a few things, and was forced to eat double of what I don't usually order double of. They also reheat their food that sits out on their cart by microwaving it. Bummer. 

I'm just disappointed that if they offer dim sum until 3 pm I would want to be able to walk into the restaurant and eat the same quality and quantity dim sum as I would if I came n the morning. I mean I am paying the same price for dim sum. I don't want to pay the same price for something fresh in the AM and then microwaved in the PM. 

But I do commend them for having some passionate owners or managers. I notice that they always come to everyone's table to personally ask how their food and service is. You don't always get that in many places."}
{"text":"It's our go to place for dim sum. BBQ pork was awesome and delicious. Looking forward to coming back again.  My daughter loves the shrimp balls"}
{"text":"Came here on recommendation of a friend.  Good dim sum but my favorite dishes today was the roast duck and the salt and pepper prawns.  The prawns had the best texture, perfectly crunchy.  Really flakey egg custard, too.  This place is at the top of my 
dim sum list."}
{"text":"had Dim Sum items and they were good. I enjoyed the taste of the food. Service was not excellent, not even good. they were quick to bring items for selection when first got there but were a little rude and didn't explain food to me in English, not do i think they could. Luckily I had a friend with me who knew how to communicate with them and also knew what was good to have."}
{"text":"So good and so fun! As soon as we sat down, the drink order was taken and the carts started rolling by. Appetizers, side dishes, main course entrees, and desserts were all options that we choose. I love the variety and freshness. The calamari and green beans were so flavorful and fresh. The other items were so good; I brought home leftovers and my husband is still talking about it. He said it's like an all you can pay buffet! Lol Just sit and eat. So easy. And our sodas were never empty and service was outstanding!!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical in coming to dine at East Ocean Dim Sum, only because I come from Hawaii and Dim Sum there is LEGIT! haha.  I mean, if you are craving dim sum, is too lazy to drive out to Spring Mountain, and lives in Henderson, I'd advise you to get your fix at this restaurant!  

Was kind of amazed at the interior decor, it's really not your typical chinese restaurant milieu!  

The food was pretty good and the price was decent.  I went with two other of my Asian foodie friends and they both enjoyed it too!  They have all of your \"essential\" dim sum items like shumai, shrimp dumplings, and the mochi rice stuffed with chicken and wrapped in leaves (I don't know what any of these things are called in English) lol.  They even have the fried items cart and fried noodles!  

Off the top of my head, I cannot think of anything that was distasteful, and that's a GOOD thing!  

I thought they service here was good, but I think that's because I speak mandarin, and my friend speaks cantonese, so they just kept coming back to ask us how everything is.  One thing that surprised me was that they refilled the tea without me even telling them it was empty!  That was a first! haha."}
{"text":"Its a nice open space Chinese restaurant. The service from our waiter was good but the food we received was not prepared correctly, bland, and watery. The last time I was here was 2 years ago because food wasn't good and I don't plan on going back again."}
{"text":"I'm super picky when it comes to dim sum, but only because I love it so much.  Everything here is larger than normal and it doesnt mean that just because its bigger its better.  But I think most of their dim sum specialities are on point with taste and quality regardless; siu mai, har gow, and fried meat ball (i like how the mochi covering is thick here). 

I dont like how they dont have enough bao selection.  That's a big thing for me when it comes to eating something sweet after all this salty!"}
{"text":"If you want really good dim sum, you need to go to Chinatown/Spring Valley area. But if you are craving dim sum but don't want to make the trek from Henderson, this place will be great! The place isn't too packed like most dim sum places on a weekend so it's a great place if you just want a quick dim sum fix.

Dim sum is pretty good (not the best I have had but will do the trick). Dumplings were smaller than other places and not as juicy but very flavorful. BBQ pork buns were tasty and not soggy. You can never go wrong with shrimp rice rolls (not sure what soy sauce it's in but it's delicious). We had the congee for the first time. My boyfriend was a fan. Fried doughnut was a little too fried for my taste. 

Service was great. They seated us promptly with drinks. I love places that refill my water without me asking (I guzzle water x.x). 

It is on the pricier end (probably because it's the only dim sum place I have found in Henderson) compared to Chinatown.

Bottom line is that if you want really good dimsum for cheaper prices, go to Chinatown/Spring Valley area. However, if you need a quick fix and don't want to travel that far, this place will do the trick!"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot because it was close to my house, clean, decent prices, and good. The other day I came with the same expectations, but I was blown away at how it went down. We went around 12 pm and it wasn't very busy, yet the dim sum carts took forever to come around. The dishes that we picked were not very good. Two dishes that stood out in a bad way were the flat noodles and green beans. The vegetables inside the flat noodles tasted old and the whole dish was cold; the green beans which had no taste were just drenched in oil. Both these plates were $9.80; Small plates that are definitely not worth that price. Just a disappointing lunch. I think I'll stick with driving to China town to get my dim sum from now on."}
{"text":"Leaving hungry. Only 4 meal carts : steam food, dessert, soup/porridge $3.5+each dish , premade main dish $11.95.

Dim sum are old, not fresh made. 
We arrived at Saturday noon 12:30
Will not recommend nor come back."}
{"text":"I used to like this place better.  The prices have gone way up and the service was spotty.  Nobody greeted us.  The carts barely came around.  The prices went up, too.  We could have eaten at the All You Can Eat Indian Lunch buffet for half the price we paid for lunch.  The dumplings were also not fresh and the selection was poor when we went.  The manager was really friendly, but the rest of the staff seemed ticked off or something."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon with a heavy craving for dim sum. Walked in with absolutely no wait time, and empty seats all around which is an experience I am not accustomed to as dim sum restaurants are generally super busy on weekends, leading me to question the legitimacy of the food. 

However, after being seated, the waitress quickly came and named/offered all of the foods she had available in her cart. The service was arguably the best I've experienced from a dim sum restaurant, which may be associated to the small volume of customers. But I have also experienced low quality service in an Asian seafood restaurant regardless if there's other parties in the restaurant or not. 

Coming from a Chinese background and having been spoiled with experiencing some of the best dim sum restaurants in the Bay as well as Los Angeles area, I would have to rank the quality of the food mediocre. I wasn't particularly impressed with any dish. However, one thing they did a good job at making was the chicken feet, which in my opinion, is almost on par with some of the better ones I've had. 

Overall, a good option if you are craving dim sum without the patience of waiting at busier alternative restaurants or have lost your voice the night before from partying on the Las Vegas Blvd Strip and would like to have a decent conversation with your party."}
{"text":"They skipped my turn to be seated. They just seat the people after us ( there was a waiting line and we were the first of the line). My kid and I were upset. When we were finally seated, the table and chairs were still dirty and asked them to clean nicely, they looked so annoyed. We just ate a few items and left. It was just disgusting eating at the dirty sticky table.. I was happy that I found dim sum restaurant in Henderson, but I am not going back there any more because of the worst service and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was Bland but to be fair we were the last there, leaving around 9 pm... Sign says open after midnight but they're were closing the kitchen. It was a decent experience but not one we will likely repeat."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and am not happy with the quality of the dim sum. I can't put my finger on it but it just doesn't taste right. 
To be more specific, the items I am referring to are: spareribs, shrimp dumpling, tripe, and the pork dumplings. 

Even in any dire desire for dim sum I will hoof it down to the spring mountain area for quality if I needed to. 

Because I was not impressed for dinner I am not confident about their dinner. I may try one day but it's not top only list."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm determined to eat here until it comes up to at least a 3.5 star for me due to the close proximity to my house.

1st visit was for dinner and garnered a 1 star for lack of service and lack of food, literally (see my original review).

2nd visit was again a 1 star (though I did not find the time to write another bad review), this time for dim sum. Everything was cold and tasted like frozen quality dim sum.

Now 3rd time, again for dim sum. Getting better. Selections were at least the right temperature. Note: my mom and I were extremely hungry so may have clouded our judgments, but I'm ok to at least give it a 2 star.

PLUS the ladies pushing the carts are the most pleasant ladies I've ever encountered at a dim sum restaurant. If you eat dim sum a lot, you will know what I mean when I say I suspect most places pay based on commission of getting rid of the food in their cart or that the ladies actually HATE their job. Not here, the ladies were friendly and went out of their way to get us dishes from other carts!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't that impressed with first visit some months ago, but had a nice lunch today. They accommodated a table of 12 easily and with fast service. That's probably the best part about dim sum in general - having the food pretty much ready all the time. The downside is that you can be somewhat beholden to the food preferences of others. Unless you don't mind ordering an entire plate of something for yourself, of course. I didn't feel like that today, opting instead with an aggressive first-and-last-bite sniper approach.

Anyway, you don't need to hear my secrets, so here's the stuff you should know: the food was always hot and yummy. Not extremely great quality, but everything that I tasted was pretty good. Well, except the egg tart - that bad boy is ridiculous. I feel the plaques forming in my blood vessels already. I was also surprised by the Chinese-style meatball. I couldn't figure out what was going on at first, but I do believe there's quite a bit of cilantro flavor going on. It was also very tender, and for a first-time experience, it left me wanting more. Luckily, I think I got my fill after noticing that nobody at my table seemed to want to kill the meatballs. I was more than happy to oblige.

I gave it a second try, and I think I'll give East Ocean a third try and more. It's definitely a solid place for Henderson folks to chow down on dim sum."}
{"text":"Love that they have dim sum all day! Our last visit they unfortunately ran out of baked bbq pork buns but we already knew that walking in since we called beforehand.  I appreciated the fact that they actually checked.  Service was really nice and suggested for us to call and put some buns on hold since they sell so fast.  Luckily for me I like the basics when it comes to dim sum, but when I want to have a little more variety the \"off peak\" dim some hours are not the time to go.  Its always nice to know its available though.  I do wish they had desserts though (hence the - star)"}
{"text":"New FAVORITE Dim Sum in the Vegas area (yes I know it's in Henderson).  Hubby and I happened on East Ocean by chance.  While shopping in the area, we required a quick, yet healthy meal = dim sum.  I knew we hit jackpot when we walked through the doors and 98% of the clientele was Asian.  Hubby and I exchanged a knowing glance and we gladly followed the ever waiting hostess to our table.

Before we could even situate ourselves properly our drink orders were taken and the food started to arrive en masse.  First observation, they have TONS of choices.  All our favorite dim sum items were present and accounted for.  

Second observation, with our first bite (of our  prospective favorite item) we were hooked.  The food is excellent.  Fresh and very flavorful.  Their chili oil, passed Hubby's seal of approval, this is a rare occurrence, very few restaurants pass this test.  If you like duck, I highly reccomend their duck.  It was delicious, juicy and definitely NOT over cooked.  Their Cane Crab is not served on a sugar cane stick, but has to be the BEST I have ever tasted at a dim sum restaurant.

Lastely, this place is large, very clean and absorbs sounds, so you can still have an intimate meal with someone and not feel like you are listening to everyone else's conversations, or they yours.  They even have a family bathroom, so you can take your kids with you comfortably.

Note:  if you bring cash you will get a discount on your meal.  They let you keep the difference that a credit card company would take, that's AWESOME, so hit up an ATM before you come.  

Also for those of you who are tourists, do not hesitate to have a cab bring you here.  It's only about 15-20 minutes off the strip and it's well worth the drive."}
{"text":"EDIT: Don't know what happened but the server has a really crappy attitude today! You lose one star...!! Get it together people!

EDIT: This is my first time back since the writing of this review and, at least for lunch, the quality of service has gone up considerably. It's been probably over a year since my last visit. I'll come back again. Ask for Sally. She's a sweetheart. Upgrading to 4 stars from two.

Food is great for not having to drive from Henderson to Spring Mountain. As for the service.... HOOOOORRRRRIIIIIIBBBBBLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEE..... with the exception of maybe one floor manager, which I'm CONVINCED he's the only person in there that knows more than a couple words of English - and - language barrier aside, just a bunch of snooty a-holes.  I still go there once in awhile, but believe me I return the negativity right back to their cut rate \"servers\". Which is easy to do when you're a 6'2'' 260lb cracker in a Chinese restaurant. =D

Enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Love love love Dim Sum needed a fix and didn't want to drive across town to get it.  So we pull up and they don't open till 10:30 : / my bad for not checking first.  There was a farmers market on this day right down the way.  So we wasted some time until they opened.

Starving by the time we get in and I know better the to be some of the first few customers for DimSum : /   The selection was nill to none again my bad.  So we got a few of our favorites and by the time the good stuff was coming out we were full.

The food we did have was good, very flavorful and prepared well.  The sizes of the Dim Sum that we got seemed larger then normal.  The prices of the dishes were a bit more expensive then China Town but it is in a higher rent district, so understandable.

I don't know if I will be back but in a pinch I would."}
{"text":"I was visiting clients in the area and was surprised to see a Dim Sum place located in the area. Located in a large shopping center parking was a breeze. 

The place is quite large and they offer their dim sum the traditional way - on push carts. The ladies were friendly and unlike some places in So Cal where they hardly speak English. I was by myself so I picked 3 dishes. I did save some room for my favorite dim sum - egg tarts and this place makes them bomb. They were flaky warm and I finished all three!

The prices here are higher then So Cal and probably even LV Chinatown but it was convenient. Total came out to $18.00 plus gratuity."}
{"text":"Definitely had better dimsum elsewhere! The dimsums were not hot and they were bland. Waving down servers was not fun either. To be honest, i don't even know the names of the dimsums i get but i get very American-Chinese food and it wasn't impressive."}
{"text":"Great service fast, very efficient big space and great staff. Place has great designs inside nice to look at. Makes you feel relax."}
{"text":"Very casual Dim Sum place, especially in Henderson. Came here with my family for Thanksgiving. Very good paced. The porridge is a must along with tofu dessert."}
{"text":"I finally had a craving for Dim Sum and this place fulfilled my craving! I had ordered to go and after my semi long walk there and back I was ready for some yummy food.

I had ordered the usuals, hai gao and shu mai. I also ordered the sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf (law mi guy) and I ordered the Seafood XO Chow Fun.

Hai Gao and Shu Mai were winners, big, plumpy and juicy. I didn't care for the sticky rice so much. The chow fun was delish! Lots of seafood, scallops, shrimp, fish and calamari. All of this for one person...for 23 bucks. Not bad at all since it fed me twice and fed the hubby once....

Take out service was efficient and when ordering they have someone that speaks English too so don't feel intimidated. Overall, I give it two thumbs up for their take out. =)"}
{"text":"This is my first time writing a review because I usually never write reviews but I was so disappointed with their level of service that I had to write a review.   I called in for a take out order and pick up time was at 6pm.  Now I arrived promptly but apparently they didn't start making my order yet until I got there.  I simply ordered chow fun and what was supposed to be a 15 minute wait turned into a 1 hour wait.  I basically watched 2 families walk in, eat, then leave.  Unacceptable.  There was another gentleman before me who apparently waited for \"a while\" before he received his take out order and he wasn't happy at all when he left.  Let this be a warning to all."}
{"text":"It's great to have quality dim sum on the east side. We have been here many times, the friendly staff has gotten to know us and our favorites. My 10 year old son is treated like a prince. We always have plenty of food to take home to munch on later. And you know it's good when there are plenty of Chinese patrons!"}
{"text":"My family and I love Chinese, but we had never had dim sum. We were surprised when East Ocean opened in Henderson in the same space where the Italian restaurant used to be. With little knowledge and just the recommendation of one of my friends I brought the family on a late Sunday morning. 

Wow - there are a lot of people here and there were very few tables available in this massive space.... we kept going. This place is beyond clean. We were seated within 2 minutes by a friendly hostess, we learned soon enough that unlike other Chinese places on or near the strip everyone speaks English and customer service is really important to them.

We didn't know what to order but the different cart waiters took the time to explain what many of the items were.We chose about 12 small dishes for the 5 of us and ordered a couple of desserts, which was enough.

Overall everything was hot, tasted amazing... my soup was a bit too spicy, but overall authentic yumminess.

The place is loaded with a big contingency of Asian speaking Henderson locals - definitely a sign  something is right here.

Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant experience I've ever had. 

Dirty, dirty, dirty... The plates still had something from the previous customers. I asked to replace the plates. The waitress took the plate, never brought another one. 
Dirty floors, dirty tables... 

I ordered soup, the waitress brought the soup with her thumb in it... I couldn't eat. 

I've ordered just chicken and veggies, it was simply uneatable. 

I left everything practically untouched. Hopefully they didn't serve my food  to the next customer...   

DONT EAT THERE."}
{"text":"Came here for dimsum, but most likely will be going elsewhere in the future. When the server took my order I asked for Thai tea and he looked at me like I was crazy so I'm guessing that's a no. Then I asked if they have shark's fin for dim sum, he turned to his coworker and started speaking in another language and started laughing all I understood was Thai tea and shark's fin. Very unprofessional if you're going to speak about a customers order do it in the kitchen and not near the customer. Horrible experience. Never again if you want decent dimsum drive to orchid's"}
{"text":"Really, really good Dim Sum, staff is great, some items get lost
 in translation, but so far everything we have ate has been great!"}
{"text":"The service sucks. Nobody seemed to know how to speak English. Their dim sum isn't the best. I usually don't do reviews but if you really want dim sum and some service, don't go there. It's worth the drive to spring mountain."}
{"text":"I've only ever been for Dim Sum.  The food is very good.   Don't skip the shrimp noodle, prawns, manila class and the duck is great. 

They are very poor about refills and getting beverages in general.   They also don't need to offer the sushi that seems to be from another restaurant. 

The dim sum is great with a good variety."}
{"text":"if i can categorize this separately for food and service, food would get a 4, and service a 1.  let me explain...

imagine if you will, walking into a chinese restaurant that serves dim sum.  Typically, this is my experience.   I ask to place a to go order for dim sum.  the hostess will take my order.  I'll  pay. I'll sit in the waiting area. Since the food is cooked, someone will grab the dim sum and place in containers, bag it and give it to me. 10 mins - tops.  

Here, at East Ocean Dim Sum, they like to do things the uneasy, irrational, inconvenient and illogical way.  Instead of the scene I described for you, I was led to table in the corner, half hidden behind a family eating there for lunch.  The hostess instructed me to wait at the table, and the dim sum ladies will come to me. they came alright....only 4 times which includes 2 repeats. I asked the cashier if I can just place my order because no one was coming to me.  She said the waiter will come to take my order.  She was useless, sorry to say. And the waiter was useless because he or she never came.  so after 50 minutes.  50! of waiting at the corner table, i took that ticket, and brought it to that cashier.  She then said to me, \" oh, you're to go?\" as if she didn't see me there, not eating, with dim sum and boxes on my table.  Anyways, I paid, boxed up and left.  i didn't even say 'thank you', which is unlike me.  I really should've left after 15 mins, but i kept saying to myself that i would wait 10 more mins.  

The experience tainted any future desire to eat at this establishment.  buyer beware - never order dim sum TO GO.  call it in or dine in..or better yet - go to china town 

ps...well...their shiu mai and sticky buns are good."}
{"text":"We are so excited there is a dim sum place by our house.  We went for dim sum on a Sunday around 10:30 (when it starts) and dinner later that week.  They are the same owners as Chang's on Decatur and Tropicana so the prices are good and the food is awesome.

They offer dim sum everyday from 10:30 to 3:30 (or so).  If you want lots of choices and their peak you shouldn't go towards the end like I read on a previous review.  

We took my father-in-law who was born in Hong Kong and lives in Edmonton.  Let me just preface and say he is VERY picky.  He thought the food was better than places in Edmonton (where they have a large chinese community) and personally thanked the waiter (which I have never seen!).

Bottom line - love that its close and that we can get authentic Cantonese Chinese food and DIM SUM! so close to home.  I hope they stay there!"}
{"text":"We came here to eat Saturday evening for dinner with our party of 13.  There weren't very many people in the restaurant dining, which seems odd for Saturday evening.  The restaurant is pretty spacious with many tables and can seat probably more than 200 people.  Not sure.  Didn't count.

My immediate family and I arrived late, while the rest of my family were already there.  They had ordered a number of seafood dishes, included were lobster, crab (not sure the names of each of those dishes), Honey Walnut Shrimp, some scallop dish with snow peas, a bok choy & mushroom dish, Peking Duck, a beef dish with onions, some type of soup that seemed to have some bird's nest or something that resembled that.  I think there might have been another dish or two, but can't quite remember.  

Let me start with the good stuff.  The dishes seemed large with plenty of food.  The table seemed big enough for the 13 of us.  The lazy Susan was large for the large table.  The food did come out hot/warm.

I was quite disappointed about the food, though.  I am a saucy person and usually LOVE sauce with Chinese dishes and otherwise.  However, everything was deeply doused in sauces, like the food was almost drowning in sauce.  That sort of defeats the purpose of tasting the food.  And, everything was just really fatty and greasy.  They were very liberal with the oil and I mean REALLY liberal.  The food and sauce was just sitting in oil, every dish and that even included the bok choy with the mushrooms.  Totally unnecessary to use all that oil.

We don't expect healthy, healthy, but some of the sauces might have been sitting for awhile as this was probably 7:30-8:00 pm Saturday evening from earlier in the day, and not sure if the sauces were freshly made as oil tends to coagulate when dishes sit for too long.

The Peking Duck looked good, but we've had this dish at many other places.  And, this dish, being that it takes a fair amount of preparation time as well as expensive, this was a huge disappointment for myself and my immediate family.  Normally with this dish, you get the skin with each skin piece usually having meat with it.  About half the skin pieces had meat and the other half didn't.  Extremely greasy.  Once again, we know this is not a low fat dish, but we've had this at a number of other places and it is in comparison to those places.

And with Peking Duck, the duck that isn't used will be prepared to make another dish.  This truly is the sloppiest dish I'd ever seen for Peking Duck.  You pay a lot for this dish and you expect them to put the work into it.  It's like they threw the rest of the duck pieces, poured some sauce, and threw in some green beans.  Seriously, I think the youngest member of our party, a 4 year old, could have done better.

Most of us ended up not even eating this dish because it was so hard to see what you were eating, whether it was a boned piece that had any meat or not.  I just gave up on this.

The Honey Walnut Shrimp was okay, but they really put A LOT of mayonnaise.  There is a point that you say, this is really just too much and it was too much.  The shrimp were big though, so that is a plus.  The walnuts were not too caramelized as they should be.

When I asked for rice, I got some sort of look, like they didn't want to give us rice.  What the heck?  This is a Chinese restaurant and giving you white rice is a hassle?

My sister and her family weren't feeling well throughout the night after this meal, so the meal must have had MSG.  My immediate family and I weren't too bothered, so it must not have been a lot of MSG, but my sister and her family more sensitive.  It would be nice to know regarding the MSG, but I wasn't in charge of ordering and cannot comment if their menu said it was MSG free or not.  

The beef dish, some of the beef pieces were well done and others were practically raw.  What the heck?  How can this be?  Was it some of the beef was leftover from another dish and they threw that in with fresher stuff but didn't cook the newer beef?  Not really cool.

Lastly, the dessert stuff.  It was supposed to be a hot tofu thing (don't know the English word for it and I don't know how to write it in Chinese).  They only gave us 4 bowls, rather than 13, which is the number in our party.  Instead, they gave us leftover Sesame Balls cut in half probably leftover from Dim Sum.  The red bean paste inside wasn't fresh because it was in a little ball rather than really pasty when it's fresh.  We know this as we have this at normal Dim Sum and it's not supposed to look like that.

It was really not cool to just give leftover crap for dessert.  To add injury to insult, the lady that gave my mom the bill (not sure if she is a co-owner or what), she had some very mean things to say regarding some of us in Chinese, thinking we didn't know how to speak Chinese, which I am fluent and so is one of my brothers.  And my sister knows enough to understand what she was saying, and her husband."}
{"text":"Loved it, classic Dim Sum service. Attack you with carts as soon as you sit down. There is a Chinese dessert called Rice Cake that I could only fint in Hawaii, finally found it here and it was done the right way! Service was great, food quality was amazing! The only downer was that some of the food was cold. Other than that I will be coming back here for a long while!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure away from ChinaTown.  Food variety when it comes to having dim sum is delicious, customer service is great and price is relatively inexpensive.  Also there is plenty of seating areas, plenty of parking and nearby shopping centers.  Highly recommend this location to anyone who craves for some oriental dim sum food."}
{"text":"Been here several times and feel it is time for a review. We first came when they just opened with Judd L for some dim-sum desert and pretty much agreed it was a 2-star experience. My last experience made me fed-up and the need to write a review. Each time we come here, service is marginal and I am accustomed to such service during dim-sum. We were rushed to leave to make way for the next set of guests. The dim-sum is about average and typical of what you will find in Vegas.

What really disgusted me was that the kitchen staff overloaded the carts by piling dishes of food on top of the food itself! Ewwww......I hope the bottom of the dishes are clean. What I saw was chow-mein on the top level of the cart. They piled additional plates of  a soy based stir-fried rice noodle dish on top of each other. And then while the cart was circulating on the dining floor, a kitchen staff in a chef's hat placed several dishes of Chinese broccoli on top of the second level of rice noodle thus creating 3-levels of food on top of each other in a pyramid fashion! I wished I got a pic of what I saw."}
{"text":"Strange...not sure why this place only has 3 stars.  I really enjoyed this place. 

We had a group of 10 folks and most of them just got the lunch special which was a very good portion including a soup, eggroll, rice and entree for $8.99. 

A friend and I decided to share the Dim Sum.  We tried probably 10 items and I liked all 10 of them.  He got the lunch special too, but I was full off of the Dim Sum. 

I asked everyone if they liked their food and everyone said they did.  Again, not sure why such low ratings, but I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"One star for their excellence in theatrics. 

If you want dim sum, please spend the extra time and gallon of gas to go somewhere more authentic. Just dined here with my family for a nice Easter/Sunday brunch before we start the rest of the days activities and if it wasn't for the pleasant surprise we walked out with, we certainly would have had a bad day.  We are frequent diners here and the way we were treated today was more than enough for us to carry on to the list of worst experiences. 

Food is average and convenient. It's close to home and it's a quick fix if you aren't willing to go the distance. But if you ask five waiters for glasses of water within 10 minutes of sitting, then you already know ordering a dish is already out of the question. You'd think one order of pan fried noodles shouldn't take thirty minutes, considering the fact that we were the first ones in the restaurant and the only table our waiter was waiting on. But it did. And after being told that it shouldn't take too much longer, we just told them to cancel the order. With that being said, they claimed they did not receive our order.

Okay, hold up. If we're asking where our noodles are for more than 20 minutes, wouldn't you think that it might beseech you to actually check up on it? This is where it gets interesting. Upon canceling the order, we asked to have the check and that we were discouraged to carry on with our lunch. They take it upon themselves and their whole non-english speaking staff to defend their argument in saying that no order was received. Excuse me honey, not a big deal, but please don't gather all the energy you have to yell at me in a different language. But after being disrespected by one waitress after saying we refused to pay for lunch, she threatened to call the police. 

How professional.

What are they going to do? Arrest me for refusing to pay for a $20 bill. I'll double that just to make sure you can get yourself some crazy pills. She had to be restrained by her managers and five other waitresses. Is there a clear enough picture to paint crazy? I'm your customer. Your job is in our hands.

I swallowed my pride, paid for our petty brunch and walked out of there. To sum it up, please don't eat here. Don't pay to be disrespected.

Run a business with at least a little bit of class."}
{"text":"East Ocean is love. East Ocean is life. Definitely the best authentic Chinese food in Vegas, with a huge menu. Try the hot and sour soup and the whole crab."}
{"text":"This place is good the people are friendly but there is one problem and its a big one....when they bring the carts around and you make a selection, if your dish is cold, they tell you to wait so they can throw it in the microwave. Yes, they actually tell you please wait we have to microwave your food....wow."}
{"text":"Dim sum was delicious. I'd definitely recommend it! Its been so long ago since I started this review I can't remember it now.  The problem is Yelp requires me to write way more than I have time to write.  It must have been good since I gave it 4 stars and I'm a tough rater."}
{"text":"I really like it here and its my first at this dim sum. Its perfect because its in my neck of the woods. I don't have to drive all the way to spring mountain. It's very clean and open spaced. I get that movie theater lobby feel (the way they showcase their main dishes) but its nice.  The music is on point! (Songs my aunties and uncles would sing on kareokee, where my Filipinos at!?!) And I mean karerokee style too. No problem here. The food is good, its dim sum! Price I dont know, my boo paid for it.  

I will be back!

YUM!"}
{"text":"Last day before I head home and decided to have me some dim sum.  I love it!  My visit here was about 2 hours long.  Believe I may be petite, but I am not shy.  Everything I ordered was yummy.  My table kept getting full.  I kid you not, I had about 15 dishes.  Everyone around me kept staring at me eat.

2 of my faves were the steamed ginger tripe and of course chicken feet.  Dim sum ain't dim sum without the chicken feet.  The portions are a pretty good size and not that expensive!  It's right down the street from Pho Mai Lan, another great place to eat.

Happy Dim Sum!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for several years. Up until today, I was so thankful to have a great dim sum place so close to home. My wife and I would walk in and immediately be offered carts of har gow, siu mai, steamed pork buns, salt and pepper wings... you know the drill.

Sadly, though, I'm saddened to report that all of my Henderson dim sum happiness has come to a crashing halt.

Gone are the carts loaded with dim sum goodness as they have inexplicably been replaced with a menu ordering system. WTF??

We waited 20 minutes before the waitress took our order (with exactly 12 people in the restaurant at 1pm - yes I counted), and then another 20 minutes before the food arrived only to be informed that they were \"out of spring rolls today\". I'm not making this up. A dim sum place that \"is out of spring rolls\". That's like a Mexican cantina being out of tortillas or an Italian trattoria being out of pasta. 

Wor wonton soup bowl was placed in center of table and we needed to wait another 5 minutes for 2 small soup bowls and spoons (which I had to ask for). Soup tasted bland and looked like dishwater with a few stale wontons in it. A few small pieces of bok choi but not a trace of chicken, pork, shrimp, mushroom, snow peas...nothing. 

Siu mai was cold and stale (after supposedly being made fresh in the kitchen).

I don't know what happened to this place but there are way too many fantastic food options in Vegas for us to waste another trip here. I predict it will shut down within 3 months. It just has that vibe.

Buh Bye."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our evening at East Ocean.  The staff and management are professional and friendly, and the food is great.

We started with the best Hot and Sour soup I've ever had.  And the portion is enough for 4 people.

My wife had the Honey Walnut Shrimp with Broccoli.  A large portion.   At many restaurants the glaze is too thick, too creamy.  Not here.  Amazing but light flavor and very fresh shrimp that pop in your mouth.  The Broccoli was simple and steamed.  Melon would have been a great addition.

I had the Black Bean Scallops with Chili Sauce.  Also a large portion.  This dish was outstanding.  Fresh scallops with a not-to-spicy chili sauce.  One of my complaints of this dish in other restaurants is that you cannot taste the scallops.  East Ocean does a great job of balancing flavors.

Music was quite and appropriate.  The atmosphere was a bit unusual with the high ceilings, large open space and decorative \"movie film\" ribbon display on the wall, but by no means a negative.

Highly recommended and we'll visit again.

Note:  If you pass this area on South Eastern Avenue regularly you may have noticed this space has had a few restaurants open and close over the past few years.  I often hesitate to go to a new restaurant in such a space because it seems like they all fail there.  Give this one a chance like we did...I think you'll be happy."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place out after having some dim sum cravings. Not impressed and food quality was sub par. Located in the busy plaza next to BJs Restaurant and Brewery, I was surprised it was pretty empty for dinner. There were some families, but it looked like they have been waiting awhile for their food. 

A hot pot of tea came first so I figured the rest of the service would be prompt, but that was not the case. It took about ten minutes before the same hostess asked me if I was ready to order. I wanted dim sum and luckily the items I wanted were available. The server/hostess informed me not all dim sum items were available for dinner beforehand. Good to know. After I placed my order, it was another while before the four dishes came out. The rice noodle rolls ( the shrimp and beef ) were dry and fell apart. The meat was tough and both were very oily. The pork shu mai and shrimp har gow tasted as if they were reheated and came from the frozen section of a grocery store. I ate in disappointment and asked for the check as soon as I was done. The check came quickly though. 

The hostess/waiter was working hard and was fairly friendly, but I would not recommend this place for dim sum at all. Too bad because the restaurant is in such a prime location. The wide availability of seats in such a busy spot should of been my first red flag. Should of listened to another fellow Yelper. The stars are for the hard workers and for the place being clean."}
{"text":"This was my first Dim Sum experience in Vegas (I was fortunate to enjoy it in New York a few years ago with my very knowledgeable BFF, Lily) and it was quite pleasant! Luckily, I remembered the dishes I enjoyed before (in NY and growing up in Hawaii) and I also got a heads-up text from Lily, so I knew exactly what to order.

Roasted Pork: Crispy skin, flavorful duck meat with a tasty sauce to dip.
Calamari: Batter was okay, but the spices were delicious. Squid could've been fresher.
Fried Shimp: Lightly fried whole shrimp with wonderful flavor. Again, just really great spices and it was cooked perfectly.
Beef Rice Rolls: I know their shrimp counterparts are much more popular, but these were just as good. The sauce was necessary, but just a tad salty. I like the glutinous texture of the rice noodle/wrap.
Spinach Ball: Haven't figured out exactly what these were, but they were giant \"shu mai\" stuffed with spinach (or at least I think it was) and a type of meat. It was pretty good.
Turnip Cake: One of my favorite dim sum dishes! Shredded radish, rice flour, steamed, and pan-fried. Same glutinous texture with a nice crunch. Yummy.
Barbecue Pork: Good flavor. I liked the thick slices of pickled radish that is served under it.
Char Siu Bao: Steamed barbecue pork bun. Yum! Soft and chewy bun filled with flavorful barbecue pork. Well done.

We enjoyed everything and although it wasn't very busy, the items off the carts were still fresh. They didn't have the turnip cakes when we got there and they were great to make it for us. Service was prompt and nice. We also enjoyed the tea service with our meal rather than our typical water. Great experience and convenient location!

Advice: Know what you want before you get there (whether you want Dim Sum or regular plates), since carts will swarm you immediately (and I mean, you haven't even settled in your seat or placed your purse down lol). Don't be afraid to ask what's on the cart or for items not on the cart. Also, it's a fast-paced environment so don't expect them to babysit you, just flag someone down when you need something and just shake your head politely when you don't want anything else (otherwise, they'll keep trying to sell you). Most importantly, enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for dim sum in stead of going allllll the way to spring mountain. The dim sum is good and the staff is so nice!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this disaster of a \"restaurant\" 1 star is because I don't have a
choice. FOR EVERYONE READING THIS REVIEW, CONSIDER THIS A FAIR WARNING! 

I just moved across the street and wanted to give this place a try, from the outside looking in; it looks like a nice spacious place to grab lunch from. When I walked in nobody greeted my boyfriend and I for about 3 minutes until a lady finally came to the front and sat us down, asked us what we wanted to drink and then sat 2 tables behind us to stuff her face with a table full of food. When she came back with our waters, I ordered a small bowl of hot and sour soup along with an order of pot stickers. Literally 5 minutes later she came back and my boyfriend ordered the house noodles, she took his menu and left mine, she never took my order. The soup had been sitting out for hours I'm assuming, because it wasn't even room temperature, it had no flavor, taste, or warmth AT ALL. GROSS!! My boyfriend took one bite of the pot sticker and had to practically yank it from his mouth because of how rubbery the texture was, it was cold too. I wasn't going to eat anything else from that place, and since the server was so conveniently close behind us -STILL EATING TONS OF FOOD MIGHT I ADD, I called her over to the table. I told her the food was cold and to cancel the order, she insisted that the pot stickers were made fresh so I then took my fork and tried to cut ALL of the pot stickers in half, one by one -they were all rubbery, she tried to look surprised. She then tried to explain that the pot stickers were 'dim sum' and they were made like that and kept saying that everything was made fresh... SMH. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty, so the slow service was confusing since there wasn't a lot of people there in the first place. After waiting and growing more and more annoyed we finally ordered our food and the waiter did not get the order correct. Two items that I ordered were not initially brought out and my sons curry dish never arrived until I had to remind the waiter twice. Odd thing is..when he brought out our \"dim sum\" dishes I asked him about my son's curry and he said he was bringing it yet when we reminded him after we realized it was never going to manifest on our table he claimed to not remember us ordering it. I also ordered salt and pepper calamari and he gave us shrimp so he seriously was not listening to a word we said.


So after the long wait we tried the:

1. BBQ Pork (it tasted slightly off, like meat that was about to turn) One bite and I couldn't eat anymore. The meat was hard and not pleasant to eat.

2. Pork Buns (Had to send them back because they were STALE) I know what Pork Buns taste like and this place obviously likes to give their customers old and stale product. 

3. Salt and Pepper Calamari (I had to order it again since the server gave us shrimp instead) Only decent part of this meal but they were VERY oily and greasy.

4. Salt and Pepper Shrimp (He sent this instead of our Calamari) and it was deep fried with the head and shell still on it. After peeling it to get to the shrimp the shrimp inside had no flavor..all the flavor was on the shell and the outside. The pictures were so small I would NOT have ordered it had I know this was how it was going to come out. We only ate two and could not eat the rest..

5. Chow Mein - Greasy and Oily. Not good and I've had good Chow Mein. This was not good Chow Mein. 

5. Chicken Curry - (My son finally got it after we reminded the serve) It was actually pretty tasty. Heavy on the cornstach to thicken the sauce but compared to the rest of our meal it was good.

6. Vegetable Spring Rolls - Gummy on the inside and the outside was nicely fried but oily. The gummy inside indicated a frozen product and was not fresh.


All in all for my birthday dinner this was beyond disappointing. All three of us had stomach aches after and we will NEVER eat here again. In fact we have already warned several friends of our experience."}
{"text":"Currently my go-to spot when I am craving dim sum. The food is great with lots to offer. You are served pretty much right when you sit down and it is non stop food. After each cart visits your table once it starts to slow down and you will need to flag them down if you want more. 

My go-to dishes are the chow mein, shrimp or pork shumai, steamed pork buns, shrimp har gow dumplings, seasame seed balls, coconut bread dessert"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. Dim sum is decent but depending on the day and time, the quality and variety greatly fluctuates. 

Went for Mother's Day with family and never made it to actually being seated. The sinister hostess grumbled at me to wait when I asked if I could be added to the wait list. She then stood there, doing nothing between seating others in line. After 15 min of waiting & other parties coming into the restaurant, I approached her again to add my name. She yelled \"You wait!\" She then lumbered to the front desk and yelled, \"okay, I get names now!\" 

Really? REALLY??

A crowd of about 20 people went forward to submit their names, but I got to her first (as I was there before the others) and asked for a table for 8. She glared at me, wrote my info, without saying a word. When I asked what the average wait was, she responded, \"5 minutes or maybe hour and a half. Either way, you wait!\" 

Really, she seemed inordinately invested in my \"waiting\"...

After seeing her treat everyone else rudely & talking to my family, we decided it wasn't worth it so we left. 

As far as returning in the future, and this is directed right at snarling, hissing \"Dragon Lady disguised as matronly hostess\", YOU'LL be waiting for a loooonnngg time."}
{"text":"Run Forest Run!!!!!  Save your money and go to Cathay House or orchid garden in Chinatown. Worst effin dim sum I ever had!!!!! Their oil was not hot enough so any fried items were greasy. Had fried smelt and before I have tried it the mamasan grabbed it and said let me make it more crispy and took it and fried it again and man was it bitter!!!! Told her and all of a sudden she no speaky English. Nasty nasty nasty this is bad Americanized dim sum. A waste of 40$ for 2.  Update: showing signs of food poisoning today that don't need description. I swear I was stupid not to trust my instincts but if you go after this then you're dumber than I am because you've been warned.   Uneffin believeable I've eaten all over China,Viet nam, Thailand and the rest of the Asian world and never got sick but come back here and eat here or IHOP and shit my guts out.  Effin run from this place!!!"}
{"text":"Very upset with service will never eat again!!!!! Came here purchased certificate on restaurant.com. They would not honor my certificate said they are not accepting any coupon said they did not make any money off them. Well that's not my fault why did you even do business with the company???!!!! One of the waitresses said they were told to accept it if purchased on a certain date. She then said she needed to to verify with the manager. This to me is so bad for buusness at least they could do is honor there coupons and contact who they did business with and have them cancel these or do something. I would have never purchased this certificate they have horrible service he food is ok only.. This restaurant will lose business because they have no customer service or know how to run a business."}
{"text":"Favorite dim sum hideaway in Henderson  I love all their shrimp dishes and checking in through yelp got me a free glass of chardonnay!"}
{"text":"Appreciate what they do with the decor and ambiance and I did not try the dim sum.  I had some lo man and some fried rice with lemon chicken. All were standard fare and standard prices. Definitely not a bad place to eat if you're in the area perhaps good dim sum is better. I will be here if I was in the area, but it wouldn't be on my list for destination Chinese food."}
{"text":"I was really excited to check this dim sum joint at Henderson. Why drive to Springmountain when you can something close by? 

We came for Thursday dinner and was seated right away. The place is immaculate for a Chinese restaurant! Staff were attentive as well. We enjoyed their complimentary jasmine tea. They did not have dim sum carts, but you may still order dim sum. We ordered shrimp har gow, pork shumai, pork buns, broccoli leaves (dim sum order), sticky rice and corn soup.

The corn soup was amazing! The soup had a really good broth, although it needs a tad bit more salt. Our dimsum were okay. I was not impressed with everything we ordered. I actually had to try 1 of each and did not want more. 

I would not be coming back. I'd rather drive and have amazing food than have mediocre food."}
{"text":"East ocean is a good place to eat at if you were seeking for dim sum . They have good service and delicious food, i definitely would recommend to eat there for seafood.
One family favorites include the Hong Kong Fried Noodles with seafood...Fried rice with salty fish..seabass hotpot..salt and pepper pork chop...all the dim sum!!!
The prices and portions are perfect for big families too."}
{"text":"I was soooo looking forward to enjoying dim sum without having to travel too far from Henderson. But it looks like I will have to keep trekking to Chinatown. Sigh.  

I will say the place is spacious and pretty clean. However, my other half did go to the bathroom and he said it was gross. We were there on an early morning during the week and not too many people were there yet. I know a lot of reviews stated they experienced awful service but service wasn't that bad. Everyone was pretty attentive.

Now onto the food... The selection was O-K but nothing was really hot. Most dishes were just warm. The flavors were bland and nothing really stood out. I was a bit irked as they didn't have shu mai which I think is pretty standard. They said it was coming and we had to wait for it. 10-15 mintues later, it finally came. Surprise,  surprise, it was piping hot! But again, the flavor just wasn't there. It had some huge bland shrimp on top which kinda just made it unappetizing. Oh well. Back to Chinatown for dim sum."}
{"text":"This place was pretty legit! I came here with friends and family and aside from Gee's garden dim sum in Tucson, AZ. This place really took dim sum to another level! Varieties of many dim sum dishes to choose from and a big place to serve it, if I ever visit Vegas again, I'll come here again!"}
{"text":"We walked in for lunch, offered tea and within seconds were slammed with a rolling buffet of food mediocrity. While temperatures were generally good, staff speak little or no English and a couple items ordered were ok, one - chopped up pork and bones, not good. The shrimp roll was super cold and being that it was fried tasted old and dry. Yikes! The shrimp ball was hot and burned my mouth. The sauce they serve with it was Cysco mayo. Not good. No small plates for dipping, no replacement of plates at all after ordering and eating from different carts, ie foods left on side plate through out. Fried rice plate was ok at 7 bucks. A 40 dollar quick lunch for two - and, won't be back."}
{"text":"Good variety of dim sum and ambiance is authentic.  The only reason I give it 3 stars is it is a little pricey for dim sum (other places in china town are more reasonable) and the later you go then the food sometimes tastes as if it has been out for a little too long."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! It beats any dim sum place in Vegas hands down. They are fast, cheap , tasty food, great assortment and great location (off the strip) . My hubby and I have been here many times since there opening and we are always so happy with our meals. The cart pushers are not too pushy and they know and explain what you are choosing. Also they suggest what sauces are great for the dish. Carmen was our server for the last few times and she is great! The rest manager , Frank sometimes does his rounds around the restaurant and greets people and asks how their meal is. The environment is nice. Its a big spacious place and lots of food to choose from. With Green tea and lunch for two ( 5-7 plates) you will spend about $35 for two. That's a great deal!  Go check out this place ..its awesome!"}
{"text":"I was so happy that we finally have a dim sum restaurant around this side of town.  The food is ok, if u coming during busy hours. If not I would order items from the menu so they come out fresh and have not been sitting on the carts probably for hours.  

Overall I am jus happy that I don't need to drive to china town jus to eat dim sum"}
{"text":"They might have changed management but the new system is very slow to getting food. We are used to having a cart pushed around but this time it was ordered and it took us 15 minutes to get our food. The food quality got even worse not that it was good in the first place, it was just close."}
{"text":"As an update, this place is very nice.

1.  I went there at 11:30 am on a Saturday and it was a bit more crowded, so the food was fast flowing and therefore:

a.  Food Quality - Taste was great.
b.  Temperature - The temperature of the food was perfect.
c.  Specials - Annie the lead waitress came by many times with the \"specials\" like the XO Chow Fun, or the Chinese Broccoli, or Roast Duck. Did not have to ask and the choices were great.
d.  Normal Dim Sum -  All the normals were plentiful, tasty and just right in my book.
e.  Service - excellent, quick and we must have been hungry as we were in and out of there in about 45 minutes after spending about 75.00 for 5 of us.

Check it OUT.  Definitely will go here instead of Chinatown when the Dim Sum bug hits...

I will probably hold a party here too when I need 2-3 tables for 20+ people to have a nice chinese meal!

GK"}
{"text":"Yelp says they close Saturday at 10pm went in at 9:28pm and lady said they close at 9:30 very rudely 
And I don't understand If there was 2 minutes left why I couldn't made a togo order ?

Wish they would update there information :/"}
{"text":"We went for Dim Sum this past Sunday and I would have to say that the food was ok. Nothing special and overpriced. There were 6 adults in our party and the bill came out to $140 including an 18% tip that was automatically charged. Even though its conveniently located nearby we would rather have driven an extra 20 min to W Sahara to Orchid Garden. The food is much better and the bill probably would have been a little less. Skip East Ocean. It's not worth the price."}
{"text":"Terrible. So bad I feel a little sick to my stomach. First we had to ask for menus (hello?).  The dim sum was cold and old. And our meals would have been better if we had bought them in the frozen food section at the grocery store.  Swimming in grease and the msg was very intense. We left most of our food on the table and even though they noticed, did not care to ask what the problem was. We won't be back.  Way too expensive for the quality. $50 for two lunches!!!"}
{"text":"Worst dim sum I have ever had.
I came here for steamed pork buns and it was soggy. It's like they microwaved it added too much water then switched it to a steam pan. I could steam WAY better ones in a rice cooker. 
Egg tarts, three tiny bites (more like brownie bites), for $3.50? Uh????
Turnip cake was alright, but took way too long to come out. 
Service sucked, lady spoke english so that was a plus, although I speak mandarin so it doesn't matter anyway.
She didn't come back once to check on my food, just brought it over, then gave me the check later."}
{"text":"Food was okay, not too expensive. We had the half fried chicken, minced beef lettuce cups and pork shumai for $30.81. We wouldn't get the shumai again, it was just not anything special and tasted kind of weird for our tastebuds. 

The service was good. We got checked on more than enough and everyone was polite and all smiles. 

We would probably come back, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.....

I've experienced better. I must say for a Dim Sum place it's not as crowded which I love and the bill is unusually cheaper than all my other Dim Sum Places I normally go to.
I usually order the Shumai and the Hagaw and the pork buns and the Nu Sao Pao.. Sad to say I can tell a difference compared to my normal dim sum places.. The service is great , they do not herass you like at Chang's pushing for their sales and screaming in your ears.. I like the location it's just down the road from my place I don't have to run all the way to China to get some Dim Sum.. Overall I give it a 3 star. I will try them again and give them another try.. Maybe my taste buds were off that day.."}
{"text":"One crazy saturday morning, I decided to take my wife out for a nice dim sum in a dim sum restaurant other than our usual favorite the orchid garden. I thought I cannot get any better dim sum place than orchid garden in Vegas. Boy, was I wrong. Upon entering the restaurant, I notice a big sign saying Review Journal best of 2013. OOOHHH thats where orchid garden title lose to. I was expecting nothing but the best now. 

Dont know why this restaurant only have three stars rating. Cos its 5 star in my book. If you know how to make fung caw (chicken feet) right, then you are 5 star in my book. 

Its as simple as that. Good combination, good siu may, good har gaw, nice varieties, fast service and even great beijing duck. a little bit far from my place, but so what."}
{"text":"Hargow, pork shumai, char siu bao, rice cake? Yes! All my favorite dim sum are here.  I've been coming here since they opened and watched several businesses come and go (Makino's, Italian place?) and glad that East Ocean shows promises of staying. It is so convenient to have decent dim sum on this side of town.  
I feel that their variety is adequate. Quality and taste is on par.  Temperature and freshness of dim sum is great.  I love that I can get \"manapua\"/\"siopao\" here AKA pork buns in both versions of steamed and baked.  This place has the basic offerings in the steamed dumplings cart. The soup cart has congee (rice porridge), egg drop, and hot & sour.  For those that like the fried \"Chinese donut\" with their congee, just order it as a side order from your server, since it is not available on cart.  The dessert cart fell short here for me. Not too much variety and I never seem to see the egg tarts or sesame balls! Seriously?  Also, the \"pineapple buns\" was too egg-y ooey gooey for my taste.  No fruit tarts, boba or sweet tofu.  Places like Orchid Garden and Chang's have much better desserts. 
This restaurant is spacious and getting a table is usually never an issue, even for large parties.  I believe you can even have a private party or large celebration here because there is a make shift stage and podium of the West side of the restaurant.
Overall, their quality and customer service has improved. Unfortunately, their prices are higher here than other than their chinatown counterparts.  A usual $20/$25 meal was $30+ here.  I guess that is the trade off of saving gas money!  I mainly go here for dim sum, but would love to try their regular menu items!"}
{"text":"Eat weekends before 1pm or just go to changs on Decatur. I eat here lots always before 1 on weekends.  Food is outstanding. Than i broke my rule and went this week after 5 and one cart of crap from earlier. Char siu bao is  usually to die for and they microwaved it and  was  horrible beyond belief. 

East Ocean staff:

You can't microwave bread and try to save lunch hour food. Prep right and serve right or you will lose business and be forced to shut your doors. Just have dim sum cart hours then switch to menu after hours.  Your food is awesome during early rush.  Don't cheat to save money. Prep right."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! Exactly what you would expect for classic dim sum. The only reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because our dining experience was awkward when the whole staff took a break next to our table. I am fully aware that people need to take breaks and eat so I am in no where objecting towards that. It just would have been nice to have our drinks refilled or offer us more selection of food before everyone went on break. Or at least sit a few tables away from is so that their conversation wasn't louder than ours leaving us in an awkward silence. When we were done we waited a good 15 minutes for our bill, and when it got dropped off we waited another 15 minutes to cash out. It's a bummer that our experience was so awkward because the food was amazing and it tickled my craving for dim sum."}
{"text":"I was disappointed about the service. It took about 45 minutes for our food to get served, which is so unusual for Chinese rest. The food was not great, the lettuce wrap was the worst I've had so far. I will never come back to this place again."}
{"text":"We haven't been at East Ocean for about year,what a huge difference!The food was fresh and hot, there is bar,the place looks great!Definite come back again!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. I had better. Too overpriced for the taste. Very bland food. I'll stick to ChinaTown. And seemed like servers did not want to be here"}
{"text":"I like this place mainly because of its location, the best dim sum place probably still is in gold coast, but you can never get in there during weekends, it is always packed, the quality of  east ocean dim sum is close to the one in palms , but palms is too far from where I live . anyway I tried chicken feet last time , (the must try dim sum dish), but it was not good , tasted staled, like being heated many time. I love the barbecue pork , string beans, spare ribs, tasted very authentic. this probably is the only authentic chinese restaurant in henderson."}
{"text":"A must go place. Fresh delicious, hot, friendly, clean, good prices. What more do you want. Just go trust me best Dim Sim ever but bring friends it like a tapas Bar alot of food to share around the table. You can order from menu too."}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food. The manager and staff were so friendly. Definitely come back again for the next vegas trip."}
{"text":"***Strongly suggest reading before you go here!!!

My review today is solely based on the food and not the service because... what do you expect? You're in a Chinese restaurant surrounded by Mandarin speaking employees who even talk to you in Chinese... to me as long as the food is good you can talk to me in any language you want!


If you have been to Chang's Dim Sum on Tropicana and Decatur, you will love this place. Why? Because its the same chef, manager, servers, and exactly same menu!!! And I've always been a fan of their dim sum!!!

I went here this afternoon (Sunday) with my sister. It was their third or fourth day they were open and it was already packed. Since its still their 'soft' opening, they still have some kinks to work out so I knew not to go in with any expectations.... 

The food is so flavorful, the dumplings are so juicy, especially the seafood/ shrimp one. The BBQ pork buns are so moist with the perfect combination of meat and bread. Chow fun noodles (Dry), dim sum rolled chow fun noodles (dry), and Chinese broccoli was your standard dish that I recommend most people to order because you really can go wrong with soft rice noodles and fresh greens tossed in a fire hot wok with all the spices :)  My sister and I also ordered the spare ribs- Chinese dim sum style spare ribs are a bit greasy so be prepared to drink a lot of hot tea to balance it out. If you are adventurous or if you have alot of wrinkles on your face, try the chicken feet braised with sugar, soy, chilies, and jalapenos. If it's your first time, try to get over the 'chicken feet' look and take a bite, its sooo good. And because it has so much collagen packed inside, Chinese/ Korean people say its good for your wrinkles lol!!! 

My sister and I purposely ordered a ton of food so we can try everything and take it home. 

A tip I told the couple next to us and anyone else is... 1) its packed and busy so it might take a while for the waiter to take and bring out your drink order 2)once the dim sum cart comes try to take everything you would like to get because that same cart wont come back for a while as it has to make its way around the store 3)if you dont know what your looking at, but it looks and smells good just TRY IT!! Trust me asking the servers who only speak mandarin and asking them will get them irritated cause there are sooo much different dishes to explain, not just one lol 4)go in without any expectations that way, I'm sure you will be surprised!!!"}
{"text":"Great traditional dim sum with the steaming hot carts. The service was a bit slow. They need to pay better attention to customers because the food is great."}
{"text":"Te dim sum here is okay. I'm from Colorado, and I've tasted WAY better. There is only one cart, and it carries the same stuff. I'm used to dim sims having multiple carts with multiple choices. The shrimp is a bit odd... would not recommend getting those dishes. The price is also pretty expensive considering the amount and quality. The service is satisfactory, and the establishment is clean. Would not recommend if you're a dim sum enthusiast, it will not meet your expectations."}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday afternoon and ordered everything on their HH menu expect the pork 
1. Salt and pepper chicken, 5.99, 6pieces
2. Salt and pepper squid, 5.99
3. Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, 5.99
4. Beef chow fun (dry), 5.99
5. Yang Chow Fried Rice, 5.99
for $36.27

- Solid if you come here just for the Happy Hour food! 
- Salt and pepper chicken was just how I expected it. Tasted great. Loved the flavor. But it didn't match the squid. Squid seasoning was bland. 
- Chinese brocooli with oyster sauce had chicken which was a pleasant surprise. Great balance in the HH menu. Veggies! 
- Fried rice was a fail but nice compliment to the menu. 
- Beef chow fun was good! Nice recommendation.
- 5% off if you pay cash
- Service was confused. Just point. Point at napkin for more napkins. More tea? point at tea pot. 
- Tea charge fail. Some restaurants in cali do the same, so it's hit or miss. Tasted good. Leaf, not bagged. 
- Didn't bother trying the Dim Sum since OC/LA prices are so much better. Couldn't find it in my wallet to fork it up. HAHA. 
- Woman's bathroom has a very fragant soap! Exfoliate your hands! Coconut? Rocky! Nice!!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place is still open. I tried this place for the first time this weekend and I've never been soooo disappointed by dim sum. I had been craving some dim sum the whole week and since I was in this area I gave it a shot...a shot on the foot would've been a better experience than eating here.

The hostess was too pre-occupied with shenanigans so we stood around for minutes. The place was dead. Grade B, C and another C on the wall. I wanted to leave but my friend wasn't willing to go to Chinatown. He has never tried dim sum and it's very unfortunate to have his cherry popped at a place like this.

We got Cha Siu bao, flat noodles with beef, Hargao, 2 orders of siumai and BBQ pork. Everything was bland. The Hargao and siumai were fishy. The Cha Siu bao and flat noodles completely lacked meat. All dough/noodles. 

I taught my friend a Chinese phrase to describe this place and the food: bu hao! Their BCC grade probably means Beeyotch Can't Cook! I couldn't sleep that night due to a terrible stomach ache."}
{"text":"**Summary**
       - Dim Sum - This is a review of my dim sum experience where they cart around the dishes of food. This usually only occurs during lunch.
       - Taste - With the exception of the hai gao (Shrimp dumplings) everything was pretty good.
       - Authentic - This is as authentic as you can get down to the old Asian ladies who speak no English pushing the cart.
       - Service - Unfortunately, due to its authenticity, the service will seem sub par compared to most American places. Pretty much, if you don't flag someone down, they won't check on you.
       - Prices - The bulk of your items will be Group B Items. Their Group B Item prices are $3.25 unlike the $2.75 at Chang's and other places. With that said, all the other items prices are within par if not cheaper.
       - Ordering - As the carts come around, you just point to what you want and they'll give it to you and mark a letter (A, B, C, D, etc) corresponding to price of that item.
       - Newbies - If this is your first Dim Sum experience, I'd stick to the safer shrimp items (Shrimp Rice Roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mxMwo3zfJwVoCIayeNcA5w?select=PvtWU-UoVK2IPo3cr4nerA#gedf79LUUUUNNiA1ok5S5w), Hai Gao, etc) or common items (Shu Mai and buns). If you like that, you can be more daring on your subsequent visits.
       - Decor - The atmosphere is more open due to the high ceilings compared to most of the other dim sum places I've been to. It relieves the usual claustrophobic atmosphere I usually get.
       - My Favorite - My favorite dim sum dish has got to be the Shrimp Rice Roll. The sweet soy sauce they pour over it is just amazing.
**Price**
       - Hot Tea - $0.50/Person
       - Group A Items - Not sure. Didn't get any.
       - Group B Items - $3.25 - Most of the small plates
       - Group C Items - $3.95 - Can't remember what we ordered that was a C item.
       - Group D Items - $4.95 - Beef tripe stew
       - Group E Items - $6.50 - The large plates like those with Chinese broccoli or salt & pepper squid.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for Dim Sum and you're near the area. There are other dim sum places with the same food and slightly cheaper prices, but the decor at this place would tip me in its favor."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, it almost turned me off to the point of never wanting to step foot into this place again. A few months later, one of my best friend's mom wanted to do dim sum here and I had agreed to come with the hopes that they had worked out the kinks in their yum cha offerings.

We came here on a Tuesday and was shocked by the bustling crowd. Good sign that they the food was getting better and the turn over for fresh food would be quicker. A group of seven gorged ourselves silly. The selection has exponentially grown as well. We had ordered 10 different dishes that was not an option the last time we visited and even avoided most of the ones from the previous experience. The chicken feet are still high on my list. This time it was joined by a few more items. 

If there is a complaint, I just wish that they would improve on their desserts. The egg tarts are too loose and crumbled when I picked it up. If not for my cat like reflexes I would have had an embarrassing stain on the front of my trousers. The red bean sesame balls were quite thick and doughy. Pushed an already filling meal into uncomfortable territory."}
{"text":"I was surprised how busy this restaurant was on opening day, considering they had no signage saying they were open.

Anyway, this location has housed many Asian restaurants.  Hopefully East Ocean lasts a little longer.

I went in for lunch ordered 7 plates and paid $30 including tips.  The lunch selection wasn't huge, but their printed menu showed that they would have a very good selection for dinner and on the weekends.

I had:
Pork Siu Mai - flavorful without any wierd bits inside
Shrimp with Rice Noodle - the first plate was perfect, the second plate was a little dry, I think it had been in the steam cart for a while.
Chive and Shrimp Dumplings - Beautiful and delicate
Shrimp Har Gow - well prepared and fresh out of the steamer
Beef Short Ribs - a little too bony for my taste but an excellent flavor
Eggplant stuffed with shrimp - a huge portion, perfectly fried

They also had the normal selection of porridges, chicken feet, and sweets.  As noted by the table near me, they didn't have many vegetable options except chinese broccoli.   But again the menu shows that they have more that just wasn't available for lunch on a Thursday.

Everything was delivered hot, well prepared, and flavorful.  I definitely look forward to going again

Oh and did I mention it was clean, easy to get the attention of the servers and spacious?  I know it was opening day, but my big pet peeve is dim sum places that are dark and dirty (I'm looking at you Cathay House and Orchid!)."}
{"text":"Sure this place looked nice and had a huge open floor plan (perfect for dim sum), but the food just wasn't up to par. The service was quick and efficient. For dim sum we had the siu mai, Har gou, pork ribs in black bean sauce, bbq steamed buns, and fried shrimp balls. Not one thing was particularly good, the dumplings had all adhered to the bottom of the steamer they came in. When I attempted to try a siu mai I pulled the entire filling out if the rice paper wrapper because the wrapper was stuck to the tray. The fried shrimp ball wasn't crispy, rather chewy as if it had been cooked hours before and kept warm. The pork ribs were standard fare, as well as the pork buns. We also ordered honey walnut shrimp. Although the menu showed a price of $12.95, I was only charged $9.80 on the bill for it. Either way, it was a rip off. The shrimp had clearly been fried earlier and kept warm, then once we ordered it; slathered in mayo. They just tasted old and the portion (see my pic) was a joke! All in all it wasn't a horrific lunch, just nowhere near worth $40."}
{"text":"THEY SERVE SHARK FIN SOUP :-(

I was so happy to see that I have Dim Sum on my side of town.  But, when I went by for lunch and got a menu I was dissappointed to see that they serve SHARK FIN SOUP :-(

Tip: They have take-out, but in order to use your Debit/Credit it is a minimum purchase of $20.  If you going to take-out, go in with a couple people."}
{"text":"Their dim sum is great if you can get them fresh. There were couple of times that I got some old stuffs thats been sitting on cart. But dont expect great service from this place. At least the place is clean unlike Chang's on Decatur , and Kathy's house on Spring mt. They both were on dirty dining from channel 13...

Edited :  This place has gone down hill since last time I was there. No more dim sum carts. You will have to order off menu instead and the price on some items are just outrageous ( $9 for a la carte item ). They also reduced portions of dim sum."}
{"text":"With so many dim sum and Chinese eateries they all start to blend in and food is always pleasing - but the same. For some reason this place stands out and seems fancy without a huge jump in price. The restaurant itself is huge and clean. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. Food seemed to take a little longer to come out but when it comes out you know it's freshly made! Loved it and will def be back."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and have always enjoyed the food. I can't say most of the names of the dishes much less spell them so I apologize for this review. 

We usually order har gow, pork steamed bun, sticky bun, chow mein, pot stickers, shrimp rice noodle and sesame seed ball.  They now have a little menu with pictures so you can order that way though it doesn't have all the items they serve. 

They food comes out on carts fresh in their steam containers. The lady will pull up next to your table and uncover all the food so you can point out what you want. They will then stamp your card so they know how much to charge you."}
{"text":"Some of the best dim sum in town.  It's close by so that's a plus. The last time I was here they had everything we wanted and everything came by quickly. We had a great experience and the food was awesome. Can highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday night and it was not busy at all so we were seated right away. I have to say that the wait staff is so friendly that I feel badly for not enjoying the food. Maybe it was what we ordered which was the beef chow fun with gravy, peppered beef steak with mushroom, and chicken fried rice. 

One of my favorite Chinese dish of all time is the chow fun so i always order it whenever I'm at a Chinese restaurant. I actually prefer Cambodian style chow fun but I can only get that at Cambodian restaurants, of course. Anyway, the chow fun I had at this place lacked flavor. It was so bland that I thought maybe my taste buds were off but no, that wasn't the case. It was the food that was off. 

The peppered beef steak with mushroom was just OK and it was served at right above room temperature. The steam rice was warmer than the beef steak. The chicken fried rice was meh and once again there was no flavor to it.

I don't think I will be returning for dinner but maybe in the future, if I ever get up early enough, I will try their dim sum.

The reason for the three stars is for the wonderful staff and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"EDIT: Orchids garden is much better and more affordable. 

This review is for the Dim Sum they have during lunch. 

We ordered the Shu-Mai and the Ha-Gow and thought it was pretty good. I love their chili-bean sauce. It wasn't the best Dim Sum I had but it was still pretty decent. The best one is in China town in LA. 

The downside to this is that the price is pretty expensive compared to normal dim-sum. It cost us 3.50 per order when we went. 

In terms of service, I have to say that it was pretty amazing in terms of the typical Asian service that we have. They actually were attentive and refilled our waters. They were polite about asking us which Dim Sum we want and were not yelling at us like other places in CA.

In terms of atmosphere, it is actually very beautiful and feels more classy. The background in the back of the room is very clean and has nice large lighting of large pictures. 

Overall I enjoyed my experience here. The food, service, and atmosphere is amazing. The only downside is the price."}
{"text":"i was very disappointed! i came in for dimsum, granted it's a Sunday afternoon, i do expected that they are busy. When i was in there, the hostess seated us immediately, but after that, the service was SLOW, the food was NOT hot, waiting over 30 mins for hargow (shrimp dumpling) but never came, asked another waiter/waitress if they can bring us some hargow since there was only 2 people pushing the carts of steam dumplings in the restaurant that seat 250+ people!!! they told me i can not bring you hargow, you have to wait.... end up leaving still hungry and not happy!!! i don't think i will come back or recommended this place, i noticed there were 5 other tables seated around me experienced the same treatment, so much for \"Best Chinese restaurant in Vegas\""}
{"text":"Great ambiance, very clean (in comparison to most Chinese restaurants here in Vegas), authentic taste, average servers.

The food generally comes in little steamers/plate of threes or fours. The majority on the cart is from group B ($3.25) but please note that some of the larger plates are generally more expensive.

While most people come here for the Dim Sum, there is actually a menu. You can order items individually if you are too hungry or need something that isn't in the carts. 

The servers are nice enough but it's pretty average. They automatically refill tea (that costs extra) and water without asking which is a plus (but normality in Chinese restaurants). 

A bad point is that I often ended up sitting there with no food waiting for the food cart to come near my table; so try to not eat very fast!"}
{"text":"Glad to have \"dim sum\" on this side of town instead of having to drive all the way to Chinatown.  I believe the owner runs the Chang's restaurant on Decatur so he definitely has some experience under his belt.  

We ordered:  Siew Mai (a little bit chewy for me... I'm afraid to ask what else is in the stuffing besides pork... yikes!), har gow (shrimp was good but the dumplings must have been in the steamer too long because the wrappers on the bottom were all torned up), Feng Zhao (a.k.a. phoenix claws or chicken feet -- good sauce/quite tasty), tripe (yummy ginger sauce), Tan tart (custard tart-- yum!) and Lo Mai Gai (Lotus Leaf Wraps)... which I thought was the best of all the dishes.  The wrap came in a smaller size than what you would expect but it was stuffed with mushroom and shredded chicken.  

Service here is a notch better than what you'd get in Chinatown.  Server Ray was exceptional as he was very attentive -- unlike some of the others ... we would ask them for more napkins or hot sauces; they would nod like they understood -- but never came back to check on us, except for our \"buddy\" Ray.  It wasn't a language barrier either as I spoke Cantonese to them.  :-)

Anyway... I gave East Ocean a 3-star because quite frankly, this is \"as good as it gets\" here in Vegas.  I'm still in search of a quality dim sum place in this town so if anyone knows of one -- please do tell! (sigh)"}
{"text":"Came her on Sunday at about 11:15 am.  Our party was seated right away and the dim sum carts were all over us before we could really get settled in, so we ordered a few plates.  Most of the dim sum plates we got were pretty good, including pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, bbq pork buns, and egg custard.  Service wasn't anything unexpected for a Chinese restaurant-average.  Overall a pleasant experience with good food."}
{"text":"I've swore off this place so many times and then always come back because it's close by. Today was the last. 
It took 20 minutes and several request to get our drinks. The final time I asked., the server laughed and said, sorry, you don't want it. I looked and her and said no, I want what I ordered.
Then I ordered shrimp ball and the guy tried to give me some kind of honey bun. I kept saying that's not what I wanted. He insisted that was what I wanted and again I said no. I'm Chinese but don't look like it and I know what I ordered. While this was happening, another server tried to drop off soup. I look and said that's not ours. He again tries to give it to our table and I finally look at and him and said \"stop! We didn't order this!\". He left and then to the fried cart guy, I picked up the honey bun and handed it back and said \" this is not what I ordered!\". 
Their food is mediocre and service is horrible. Never again. I had to walk out because I could deal with incompetence and my husband and kids stayed behind to pay."}
{"text":"Reasonable dimsum pricing and a decent selection.  The calamari was good but the coating was falling off and a bit greasy.  The portion size was good.  Two of us without alcohol were out of there stuffed for about $40.00 which for dim sum is good.  East Ocean does everything at a solid level but I expected a bit more from a place that touts being the best on the outside of the restaurant.  I would have liked to see friendlier service, more explanation of what the dim sum items were, a bit less grease on the fried foods, and have the carts come by without having to be asked.  All in all it is a good solid meal if you like dim sum but if you are new to dim sum, be prepared to guess what you are eating."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get your dim sum fix in Henderson. Its no Southern California but the quality is there. I judge my dim sum based on the chicken feet. If its made right, then we got a go-to place. And surprise! The chicken feet were perfect. Full of flavor and perfect sweetness.

A plus for non Asians, most of the staff here speak English!"}
{"text":"The 11th Day of Christmas.

How cool is it to have dim sum for dinner and not have to go to Spring Mountain/Chinatown?  Pretty awesome, actually.  I met some friends the other night after work in Henderson and had my fill of char siu bao, pork shumai, and roasted duck with those delicious buns.  I started off with some egg drop soup that was just okay, but the other food items listed were great.  Service was fast and friendly and it warms my heart to know that East Ocean is conveniently located so that I can dine there before driving home to the other side of town."}
{"text":"East Ocean is my go-to place for dim sum in Henderson. It is always busy, and there are carts-a-plenty to choose from. 

The first thing I order is some water and hot tea. The waiters and waitresses are polite and helpful. I always order some chow mein, BBQ pork buns, shrimp shumai, shrimp balls, and sweet coconut buns. The hubby orders the fried rice, sticky bbq buns, and a vegetable plate I do not know the name of (but it is really good!).

The food here is fresh and the service is good. I have been here many times and have never had a bad lunch. If you are in Henderson on Eastern, check it out!"}
{"text":"Food: this place was just ok, but where else are you gonna get your dim sum fix in Henderson? We had har gow, bbq pork steam bun, rice in banana leaf, XLB, and lobo gao. 

Ambiance: large restaurant, cheesy pics of food on the wall and asian umbrellas hanging from the ceiling.

Service: very good. staff was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Simply the worst place for dim sum EVER! Staff seemed lost, food was sub par at best, and portions were small and not good, had to flag down a staff member for every little thing and then it took forever"}
{"text":"I like this place.  It is clean and open.  I have been to several places for dim sum and this is one of my favorites.  It is quiet and you don't feel so rushed.  Can actually enjoy some conversation (in between the food carts.)  The food choices are good and my favorite are the pineapple buns :)!!!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great dim sum! I had take out the other evening and they freshly made an order of dim sum for me and my partner.  It was delicious!  Have recommended this place to my whole family when they come into town!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the LV area recently and found East Ocean. They are amazing. Their dim sum is as good as it gets and their roast duck is probably the best I've ever had. I've been to the best in NY and San Francisco, this beats them easily. Thank you East Ocean for being here."}
{"text":"I'll give it to them. The place is clean. Restrooms are clean and that's it. The dim sum taste old or flavor way to overpowering. We got seated, handed water and waited ten minutes before I had to flag someone down and ask them how do we order. Then half way through our meal they all go on lunch so I had to bother them on their lunch to ask them to get us more food.  Never coming here again!!"}
{"text":"Came across this place bc its in my area & I was craving for some dim sum. I've been here once before & was just recently here (08/01/17). 

Let's start off with the customer service. All the employees were really friendly and nice. Always came to the table to make sure everything was ok & always offered to refill our drinks, etc... and that our food was on its way.

The food was average. I got the soy sauce chow mein (chef special) which was $9.25 it was ok. Nothing special but I was really craving for noodles so that satisfied my craving. I also got orange chicken something on their regular menu. It was fresh & yummy!! I really enjoyed it I give it a 8/10. From the dim sum menu I got sui mai, baked pork buns & shrimp and chive dumplings. These were all made to order so they were hot and fresh!! Taste wise would be 7/10. Tasted like average dim sum. 
Their dim sum menu is very limited. They didn't have much but they had the popular items I would say. 

Pricing - the dim sum was pricer than other dim sum places I've tried (for example orchid garden). The dim sum items were $3.50 each.... 

I spent a total of $40 on my whole bill. I would only recommend this place if you want dim sum around this area. I may or may not be coming back... but other than the limited dim sum menu & pricing, I would came back for the regular Chinese food because it was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this to open for a while - finally real Chinese food in the green valley area. Unfortunately their dim sum was a huge disappointment. 

We went around 11am on a Saturday. Decent sized menu but not a great selection of dim sum. We just got siu mai, hargow, char siu bao, shrimp w rice noodle, and some mushroom thing - think it was mushroom caps stuffed with pork and baked. 

Most of it was mediocre, but the hargow and shrimp rice noodle may have been made from spoiled shrimp. They were pretty small and had an off sour taste. Both dishes are basically just shrimp and rice noodles so the sour flavor couldn't have been anything but the shrimp. Fingers crossed that none of us get sick. 

The fried rice was pretty good, if a little pricey at $9. It had great curry flavor, not spicy but with a little bit of a kick. The egg was cooked all the way thru so there was no yolk to mix up with the rice, but I still liked it. 

I'm happy to have an option when I just don't feel like driving to Chinatown, but I definitely won't get their dim sum again. A huge pet peeve for me at Asian restaurants is places that don't mention that they charge for things that are generally free - rice or tea. I don't know anywhere else In town that charges for tea, but fyi its $2.50 for a pot here."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while.  We came for dinner...expecting normal dim sum as we had before for dinner here.  No precooked items on a cart.  All must be ordered.  Most items were over cooked and fried.  Took 40 minutes for our final items to arrive at the table.  We had potstickers that were crunchy.  Certainly not right.  The eggplant and shrimp had grease coming off of them.   And no, it wasn't the sauce they forgot to put on - had to ask for that.  They were out of a ton of things.  There were only two other tables seated...now I know why! Don't think we will be back.  :("}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE EVERYTHING! YUCK. OMG, where to begin....
Decided to eat here for a special occasion and was so disappointed. We arrived around 5:30pm, which apparently was early for this place. There were only two other tables with people, otherwise totally empty. We were seated at a rather large, awkward table when there was only 3 of us. The servers only brought out two dim sum carts, and the food was cold. The server noticed this just as I did, and she quickly grabbed it off the table, stamped our card, and said she would heat it up for us. WTF?! In your microwave, maybe? Eeew, not fresh. And that's not good with pork or seafood dishes! When she brought back it was not appetizing at all. We couldn't get water or drinks from any server. We picked at our food, decided it wasn't for us and waited for a server to return so we could pay the bill. Servers came and went and seemed deeply offended we didn't want any more disgusting dim sum creations. The attitude from the servers was awful. I decided to be proactive and take the bill to the register myself to pay. Honestly, they were lucky I even paid, it was so awful. When I paid the exact amount of the bill and nothing more so we could leave, the server got in my face and said \"Hey! You no leave a tip!\" I said that I absolutely would NOT be leaving a tip because I only tip on service and it was horrible. She was upset and said something to me that I can only assume was Chinese for fuck off. Classy. Anyway, we will not be coming back and happy to not ever recommend this place. It was really bad. Went across the street and had a great dinner at Grimaldi's pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is really nice and roomy. Very contemporary compared to the traditional Chinese restaurant. The food was pretty good, I would give it 5 stars but you get the same typical service at any other dim sum places... so 4 stars :) The ladies that push the cart aren't hasty or pushy but the server brings your water and is gone forever. No biggie to me actually, I'm use to it. Didnt see any roasted pork and the shrimp balls didn't have the flakey wonton breading. Spicy salty shrimp was not spicy, salty nor crispy like I'm use too. One bonus tho, the roasted duck wasn't too greasy. 

Great way to get the family together for brunch :)"}
{"text":"Been to this location several times it beats driving all the way down to Chinatown. 

Service is ok, but what do you expect from a Chinese restaurant. 

The fried rice is always delicious and the dim sum is always fresh, served All DAY, did you run out on certain items, it all depends on what time you go.

They make an awesome fried fish family portion.

The place is always clean

Pricey... but worth it"}
{"text":"Good Dim Sum clean place, don't go when busy waste of time slim pickings and takes forever, edit after 40 min only got one dumpling and a cup of tea with no food insight it was time to leave or so I thought but there was still a 10 min wait to pay so sad this place used to be so good but last 2 visits were so bad I won't be back"}
{"text":"If you don't want to drive to Chinatown this place has some decent dim sum. Also it is no longer called East Ocean it is Asian Palace"}
{"text":"Place is nice...modern look, clean.  

Auntie said that the food is bland. It is like a hit or miss. She said that the cooking is short in spices.  

Phoenix Talons had curry sauce.  I didn't care for it.  Shu Mai and Har Gar was tasty.
The servers were good.  They were attentive.

I like that we didn't have to drive far to China Town. It's a good place to go to if you live in Henderson/GV area.  It is convenient.  It will satisfy your dimsum cravings.  :o)"}
{"text":"This place used to be very good. I've been going here for 6 years. Unfortunately the last couple of years has gotten worse. I stopped coming here. The dimsum prices are expensive compared to other dimsum places. Food isn't as good as it used to be. Food cart takes forever to come around even when they are not busy. Trying to get the check to paying for the bill takes even longer!"}
{"text":"I really do like this place a lot mainly because it's just down the street from my house! Woohoo!! Finally, I can get my dim sum on without having to drive to China town or West Sahara (Orchid Garden). Overall, food is pretty solid and service is on par for a dim sum. 

Some of my favorite dishes include: the sesame balls with red bean, the calamari, shrimp noodle.... and pretty much everything else on the menu. Yes... I am a fatty :) While it may not compare to the dim sum restaurants that go by the name of Orchid Garden or Chang's but it does hold its own."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese restaurant in that service sucks but the food is good. It helps if you speak Chinese as the cart girls will get you hot and fresh dishes from the back if you ask if they have it, as opposed to what has been on a cart for a long time. They did not get me any beef balls though which was strange.

Their baked BBQ buns are the best I have ever had as they were from the back and they were freshly baked as the pork was oozing out the sides and the bread was warm and amazingly soft and melt in your mouth dreamy. Their leaf wrapped rice was nice and huge and their beef rolls were fantastic, just wish the sauce was a bit sweeter. Their egg tarts were great, nice and hot from the back. I ended up buying triple what I ordered so that I had a ton to eat the next day, which is what I always do with dishes that are good. 

I prefer this western style of decor with no tablecloths rather than the poorly lit, dirty old traditional chinese restaurants. Another table had 6 employees going over the bill as they claimed they did not eat so much, here is a hint, always watch them stamp what you ate and match it with your bill. They claimed that the cart girls overstamped and this cannot be proven as they always take your old dishes away. 

It took ages to get the bill and the girl I asked for takeout boxes never got me any so I got them from the cart girl. Time and time again, no matter what dim sum place I go to, the cart girls have better customer service skills then the waitstaff so ask them and they are less likely to forget about you as they keep coming around every once in a while. 

Also if you go for Dim Sum, never go late if you can avoid it, always go just before they open or else the food is not hot, same as a buffet, if you go late it's all cold or sold out. If they don't have what you want ask and they will make it for you if they have any left."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, my second time to East Ocean. Overall I like it but there is good and bad here. As soon as you are seated the carts start  arriving. Be prepared there are no prices listed for anything, they stamp your card with what you order. Some of the servers speak english and some do not. 

Both the fried rice and chow mein dishes we ordered were cold. Everything else we ordered was just warm, nothing hot. The honey walnut shrimp were very good as well as the shrimp shumai, bbq pork buns, pot stickers and shrimp balls. For dessert we had the custard which is so light and delicious. The custard is in a very light and flaky pastry cup. There are lots of choices on the frequently visiting carts so they have something for everyone. 

The lady working the front (I assume manager or owner) is very nice and helpful. She was checking on us and all the other customers to make sure they were enjoying everything. If the food was served hot it would definitely be 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place offers mediocre tasting dim sum without the traditional wait,  so proceed with caution!

Instead of driving to Chinatown or to Gold Coast for our typical dim sum option, we decided to settle for this place.

We went at 3pm were quickly seated in the empty, but large restaurant. Service was phenomenal and probably the best out of any single Asian restaurant that I've dined at.

We ordered the usual: shrimp rolls, hargow, shumai, baked pork buns, coconut bread and fried shrimp wontons.

Some of the foods tasted old, but we were well-prepared for that. We came at 3:00pm. For one of the dishes, they had to steam it fresh for us. However, I wasn't too thrilled about the seasoning and flavor of all of them. The dim sum just tasted average, causing me to use a lot of spicy sauce and soy sauce.

All in all, we were in and out within a reasonable time for a party of 2. We paid about $37 bucks with tax and tip. It was clean too and guess what?! My water was full at all times as they frequently checked up on us. 

Unfortunately, I will not come here again for dim sum."}
{"text":"My brother and I have eaten at East Ocean Dim Sum for the second last night. As we walked in we were immediately recognized at a past patron. They remember from first visit how we liked are food cooked   We prefer our vegetables cooked soft plus they remember that I liked a knife with my meals.  They took patience with my brother who is quite sick and explain all of his questions. The food was excellent and the food was excellent.  Yoke our waitress and Jenny (not sure of hostess name) was just outstanding and without any questions made us feel extremely welcome. As we left the Owner came over and thanked us and express concerned for my sick 

brother.  Explained to him to keep smiling and gang in there   As we open the door to leave she came over  to us and gave us a big hug and walked us to our car. If you like eating out give East Ocean Dim a chance you won't regret it. Me Keefer"}
{"text":"Consistent, fresh and delicious variety of dim sum dishes. There are a lot of dim sum places in town, but I recommend this place for this side of town. I've tried all their selections and not one was a poor choice."}
{"text":"Not the best dim sum I've ever had, but it's definitely a solid choice when you're in the Henderson area. I came here with coworkers today for lunch and I like that we have this option near work. 

Walking in, I was pleasantly surprised by how large the interior of the restaurant is. We were seated quickly and within five minutes we had a table full of goodies to enjoy. We tried quite a few things. I can never resist noodles in XO sauce and we ordered tripe, BBQ steam buns and an assortment of other things as well. We of course had to end our meal with egg custard as well. 

We had a dim sum newbie in the mix, so we tried to get lots of different things for her to try and it made the experience that much more fun. Service was good and refills on tea and waters were plentiful. Looking forward to adding this to my regular lunch rotation."}
