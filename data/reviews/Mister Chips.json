{"text":"Me and my husband ate in the restaurant and had the medium fish and chips with a pot of tea. The portions were small - usually I cannot finish a full portion but was still peckish after our meal. Also thought the fish was watery. Not too impressed with the staff either - not very friendly... We won't be going again."}
{"text":"We had a takeaway of fish, chips and mushy peas on Saturday, after looking at the quality and price of many of the other fish and chip shops in Whitby. They were the best fish and chips we have had for many years and very reasonably priced. Freshly cooked, beautiful white fish in a delicious batter, and 'proper' chips. Excellent."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to the restaurant, the quality of the food (plaice & chips, haddock & chips) was excellent however our visit was spoiled by having to wait outside a rope barrier (the restaurant was half-empty) whilst staff walked by for over 10 minutes ignoring us.


 Another disappointment was being refused slices of lemon for the 3 members of our party who ate the medium haddock - we were told 'you only get lemon with the large haddock'! Why?"}
{"text":"Amazing Cod"}
{"text":"We came upon Mr Chips in the hunt for a good chippie in Whitby, which seems to bursting with them. We bought a cod with chips to devour on our way back to the car. Sadly it did not live up to my expectations of one of the supposed top ten fish&chip shops of the UK. It wasn't bad but it was fantastic either. Everything was extremely soggy and greasy (not a bad thing if you are in need of greasy goodness but that wasn't the time for it), the fish a bit cold and the chips left us indifferent so we couldn't even finish them.  Perhaps we ordered the wrong thing but our group agreed that we had experienced better."}
{"text":"You can tell how good the fish and chips are by the way people are happy to queue at busy times.The batter and fish are absolutely yummy and we usually buy them out and try to sit near the harbour. Sometimes we drive up and sit near the abbey to eat them -heaven! They are freshly cooked that they lose nothing on the short drive.There are various specials which are cooked to order. You can buy hot and cold drinks.The cafe is a treat too and do a good fish platter. A year or two back we went to Whitby and headed for Mr. chips and they were closed for a refit. We were gutted but have made up for it since!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips. Had to wait about 10 minutes to get through the door but this is a testament to how fresh it was. The small and medium sized portions do appear to be roughly the same size, so save yourself the Â£1.90 difference! Excellent batter, very fresh tasting fish and great chips. They have some interesting sustainable fish options, too, which would probably be more popular if they weren't more expensive than Cod and Haddock.
It's good, simple, fish and chips. All you want from a place like this, really!
Recommended."}
{"text":"If in Whitby and we want Take Away Fish and chips we always now go to Mister Chips. The service (length of queue)is reasonable , the price similar to others and the fish is fresh, tasty and in good batter."}
{"text":"Nice little busy fish restaurant. Attentive young staff. Service was a tad slow but it is a busy day in Whitby. Nice clean seating area.. would recommend."}
