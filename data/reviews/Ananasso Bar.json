{"text":"Stayed at a little bed and breakfast that sent us to this cafe for a yummy breakfast! They were right... this place had everything we wanted! Cappuccino, yogurt and granola, then a stuffed pastry! Yummy to the end!"}
{"text":"Pour boire un verre rafraîchissant au milieu de la balade entre les Cinque Terre c'est idéal ! Terrasse avec vue magnifique.  En revanche prix du jus de citron et orange pressé cher !! 4 et quelques !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I hiked into Vernazza from Monterosso...and we located this bar along the waterfront. It had a great view of the \"harbor\" with chairs right outside the restaurant - we ordered a drink and sat down to rest up after our long hike.  They have clean toilets! :)"}
{"text":"Great place to lounge after a hike or people watch, right on bay.  The waiters hussle and are attentive even in all the chaos under their yellow umbrellas.  Loved the time there with small pizza, water and coffee for mate."}
{"text":"No better place to start your morning than here with a cappuccino, cornetto, and punk music on the stereo."}
{"text":"This was me and my girlfriend's absolute favourite place during our stay in Vernazza.   The staff was friendly, and the meny was good. However, The Ananasso Bar's strength is the location. It is situated in the middle of the square, just by the harbour, so one can enjoy their breakfast or maybe evening drinks here with a great ocean view.  My favourite drink here was the Bellini, made from fresh peaches.   I'd recommend this place to anyone visiting."}
{"text":"Great coffee and delicious cappuccino for a price you can't beat! We ordered at the bar and sat at a small table in the back for no extra charge.  Perfect for a quick breakfast or an evening drink.  Right on the piazza with great people (tourist) watching!"}
{"text":"We came here after a long hike and had a great time! We got an Aperol spritz and Basil spritz and both were very tasty. We were even brought out some complimentary nuts/chips/bread. The view is great the outdoor seating is nice, and drinks are delicious!"}
{"text":"Best bar/pub in Vernazza for sure. They have tables with umbrellas set up right along the edge of the harbour and a really great drink menu. We sat inside for about an hour just watching the 3 comical bartenders work efficiently and impressively all while engaging with customers and putting on a show. I especially loved the generous snack plate that they give you once you order a drink and sit down. It is seat-yourself outside so keep your eyes peeled for a table and be ready to snatch it as soon as someone gets up if you are there anytime during warmer weather."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for watching the sunset. Cheap local wine options. Looks like locals come to watch soccer games here."}
