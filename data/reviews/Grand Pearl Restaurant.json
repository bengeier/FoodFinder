{"text":"Average food and service, but the owner has super bad attitude.   1. She argued with you for every penny. 2. She gave attitude when I was asking extra soy sauce and hot sauce for take out dim sum. 3. She hanged up on my phone when I asked about Entertainment coupon (2 for 1 Entree) 4. She never smiled and I never feel welcomed!  I refuse to go there even thought I have the 2 for 1 coupon. I do not want to see the owner's face or give her business."}
{"text":"Not So Grand - Chinese restos have never been renowned for their ambiance & decor. It's actually neat that Grand Pearl is situated in an old Pizza Hut. After experiencing dinner there, they should've kept it as a pizza place. The Black Pepper Beef had meat that was tough like the raw hides I buy for my Mad Dawgs to chisel their teeth on. The Salt & Pepper Pork Chops were an aberration, more chops than pork, bones of pork caked in batter, all flour & no meat. The Princess Bride even commented that the green bean dish was comprised of a mixture of young, crispy, fresh beans, interspersed with ones that were evidently forgotten in the bottom of the veggie crisper. A Grand disappointment."}
{"text":"Family run restaurant with excellent food but poor service.  The dim sum is very good and is the fill in the form type service.  There is English descriptions.  I've tried the Peking duck in the evening and it is very good and a decent value.  Overall I do enjoy eating here just be prepared for slow service."}
{"text":"After the Pet Expo, my girlfriend and I decided to pick up dinner for our significant others who were hungrily waiting at home. Her and her hubby frequent this restaurant often so I didn't object when she suggested grabbing dinner here.   Once we glanced over the menu, we decided on the set Dinner For 3 (it sounded like a lot of food and it actually was!) It came with spring rolls, won ton soup, chicken fried rice and a choice of 3 pre-selected entrees (we got ginger beef, almond gai ding and upon asking we were allowed to get the salt and pepper squid for an extra $3 Yayyyy!) It was about a 30 min wait so we quickly went to the nearby Walmart and made it back just as they were bringing our nicely packaged food.  I was impressed that the soup and the ginger beef container were wrapped in plastic bags before being put into the main bag, I can't count how many times I've had soup or sauce seep onto my car seat!   The food smelled deeeeee-lish and I couldn't wait to dig in. The spring rolls were crispy (veggie filled) and the won tons in the soup were meaty and broth nicely flavored. The entrees were equally as good, there was a hearty serving of veggies (celery, carrots, baby corn and water chestnuts) with the almond gai ding (which came with nice chunks of chicken) and the ginger beef and S&P squid didn't disappoint.  I really enjoyed our meal, and I would definitely be back - maybe next time we'll dine in!"}
{"text":"Date: 9/3/2014  Time: 8:30pm  I love Chinese food and I travel all across North America.  I am a chinese connoisseur.  One of the worst dining experiences I have had in years.  Bottom Line - Just say no.  When walking in you are hit with a wall of fish smell.  Almost lost it.  First, had to use the washroom.  Dirty.  Door is propped open, could not shut it.  Soap was fine (yes I wash my hands afterwards), but the paper towels were not filled and the hand dryer was WEAK.  And a spare chair in the toilet area?  For what?  The hot tea came in a tea pot that hadn't been washed in weeks or months.  The lid was tied to the pot with fishing string.  Disgusting.  I ordered water with lemon and when I asked for a straw, the waiter gave me the look of disbelief and huffed off.  He returned and before I could do anything, he put the un-wrapped straw in my glass of water with his hands.  Gross.  I ordered sweet and sour chicken.  Out.  Lemon chicken.  Out.  No general tso chicken.  Every time the waiter suggested Crispy Chicken.  I have never had it.  After 3 times, I figured it out - I was having crispy chicken.  And I ordered Hot n Sour soup and chicken fried rice.  I tried to order and egg roll, but they only have spring rolls.  Crispy chicken was delivered first, no plate for me to put a smaller portion on and enjoy.  5 minutes later the chicken fried rice.  Still no plate.  I finally just ate over the fried rice plate.  The crispy chicken was presented rather blandly, half a chicken cut aggressively in what appeared to be random spots with a crispy skin.  I nibbled a bit of the pieces that I was able to identify as chicken breast, leg and something that looked like it was a good piece of meat.  I avoided the back and neck and the wings were not edible.  The chicken fried rice was good.  I asked for some sweet and sour sauce expecting him to say \"Out\".  Instead he looked at me again like I was an idiot and marched off.  Returned shortly with  small saucer of red sauce.  It was very tasty and significantly improved my chicken fried rice experience.  But there was only enough for a third of the plate.  I didn't dare ask for more.  The hot n sour soup - never arrived.  Waiter disappeared for 15 minutes.    Went to pay.  Lady at the cash register answered the phone and left me there for 10 minutes while she talked in Chinese.  Waiter returned and cashed me out.  $22 total.  Most of the food was left behind and my stomach started to hurt the minute I got to my hotel room.  Bottom Line - Just say no."}
{"text":"family operated. food taste above average. service kind of below average.  all the asian restaurant, service pretty much the same. good food, lack of service."}
{"text":"Service were always poor especially when busy. Female owner extremely rude to customers. I had seen twice customers returned and complaint about overcharging, so watch your check when paying. My last dinner there the Peking Duck was only half cooked with blood sipping and we got food poisoning afterwards, we had an argument with the female owner but she refused to do much and challenged us to contact the health department. We will never eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. They don't smile and they're so rude. It takes them 20 mins to get one cup of water. Food is okay, not the best. Definitely not coming back here."}
{"text":"Had dim sum at Grand Pearl.  We ordered:  Pork and Century Egg Congee - ordered the large size - so very good on a cold winter morning; ate it with the deep-fried Chinese doughnut (yow char kwei); Perfect combination! Har Kow (Steamed Shrimp Dumplings) - quite good and fresh, plump  Siu Mai (Steamed Pork and Shrimp Dumplings) - big and fresh Steamed Chicken on Rice HotPot - Delicious; the sauce had a nice sweetness and saltiness all at once; the rice was cooked with pieces of ginger - so fragrant! Deep fried taro spring rolls - So good!  Eat it with the worcestershire sauce Pan Fried Taro cake - not bad  Make sure to get some hot sauce (lat chiew cheung) to eat with your dim sum."}
{"text":"Food is above average and the service is slightly above average for a Chinese restaurant.  I find it hilarious that the chair in the toilet stall mentioned in Gary M.'s review from 2014 is still there.  I don't know what it's for, but there's no way I'm sitting on it."}
{"text":"Food was good. But had a hair placed in my food, most likely because I am Caucasian. When my Chinese friend pointed it out to the waiter he laughed hysterically, no doubtly lying, saying it wasn't placed there. Very rude, and very poor service. I was nice to them and didn't deserve it."}
{"text":"I'd have to say, the food taste here is decent.  They have one of the best deep fried salt-n-pepper squids around.  However, that's pretty much where to good things end.  Service - Terrible. Slow and they don't listen to what you want.  They try to up sell you on things.  I'm not buying  car here.  They are friendly though but only because they know they are getting paid.  Cleanliness - Disgusting.  Would it hurt to mop the floors and wash the walls/windows once in awhile?  Washroom?  I'm not even going to touch that one.  Just make sure you went before leaving the house.  Smell - As soon as you walk in you get a waft of fish smell that makes you wonder if it's rotting or frying (probably a bit of both).  It's a bit sad when you would rather eat the Pizza Hut (it used to be one).  I'd only go here if someone really wanted to go here and they were paying.  Oh and only if I was on my way home afterwards because you tend to get the sh1ts afterwards."}
