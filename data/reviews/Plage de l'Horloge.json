{"text":"Superbe plage en plein coeur du vieux-port de Montréal! Venez y admirer la vue sur le Vieux-Montréal, le centre-ville & le pont Jacques-Cartier.  Excellent endroit pour voir l'international des feux Loto-Québec de La Ronde. N'oubliez pas votre telephone intelligent ou votre radio FM pour la trame sonore.  N.B. en date du 4 aout 2012, le permis d'alcool n'a toujours pas été acquis :-\"}
{"text":"City BEACH in Montreal !!! And it is free by the way.  They have an area for getting your drink on.  They have chairs and umbrellas, throw in a free bathroom you can BYOB.  The sand is high grain, fine white sand that they truck in so it will get in everything so dress accordingly, ie, sandals.  I was there Friday afternoon in August when the weather was perfect and it was not crowded at all, people stopping by to sit and chat for a bit after work.  They just need water access and it will be complete"}
{"text":"It's a beach.  In a city.  Picture a small strip of sand, surrounded by parking lots.  If you find yourself there, then you might as well stop by - but otherwise, it's not the end of the world if you miss it.  Montreal has much better attractions.  Even within a five minute walk of here.  On that note, it makes a fine place to stop by while walking between attractions."}
{"text":"So, the place looks good. I mean you can't  go wrong when you have this amazing near the water location. But it's not my vibe. Super loud house music and the crowd directly from beach club or after hours."}
