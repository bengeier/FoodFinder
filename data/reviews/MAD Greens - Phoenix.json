{"text":"Only complaint is I was unable to tip them on CC cause it's \"company policy\" bit to accept tips. The sweetest guys :)"}
{"text":"Our first time there.  The food was fair and fresh.  Service, not so much.  Order was wrong, we had to ask about our drinks twice.  Not a good first impression."}
{"text":"Generous portions of healthy salads with lots of tasty ingredients.  Friendly staff who seem to enjoy working there."}
{"text":"My roommate and I were headed to the popular burrito/bowl bar for something familiar when we lucked upon something unexpectedly wonderful.   Mad Greens is a health conscience, heart tempting, salad, soup, and wrap spot with locations across the greater Phoenix area (as well as across the U.S. of A). We stopped by the 'too cool for school' N. 7th Ave. location situated in the trendy Roosevelt District.   It's unassuming exterior gives you no hint to the awesomeness that lies within. The industrial interior is clean and simple and the music selection (on the evening we were there) was totally on point. From its staff to its sustenance, Mad Greens is for the sophisticated palette in search of quick, convenient, and clean eating. We decided to try their newly introduced Hearty & Heartful Grain Bowls and we were not disappointed. I tried the Southwest Bowl, my roommate, the Tokyo Bowl and we were giddy with the results.. The variety of ingredients was refreshing and the flavors (not to be clicheic) \"Gave me LiFe'! Even their beverage selection was an upgrade from the average...HUH!  As a recent transplant and seasoned foodie, my goal is to seek out delightful dining spaces that provide tasty fodder for family and friends who visit. Some reviews suggest that the menu items are/were pricey but that was not my experience; each bite was worth its weight in gold. I also appreciated the opportunity to customize my selection; it made me feel as if I was part of the menu making process.  I would highly recommend this energizing eatery and encourage you to specifically visit the N 7th Ave. location.   Kudos!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food. Caesar salad is delicious and you can never go wrong. Can't wait to try some of the other options on the menu.. PS... Get the toffee cookie"}
{"text":"Just got aTokyo bowl and even though I said yes when asked if I want chicken, there is none in the bowl. Unless it's diced up too small to see. Still tastes good, just not what I wanted."}
{"text":"First time here. Really liked the place and the service was wonderful. I greatly appreciated that they ask if you want the dressing poured on light, medium or heavy. It was the first time in a long time I was able to enjoy a salad that wasn't swimming in dressing. The ingredients tasted fresh and the tofu was amazing. I will definitely be stopping in again."}
{"text":"Very good relatively healthy options in midtown.   Lots of salads, wraps, and paninis as well as several froofy iced tea options in addition to local sodas. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Love this... I got their Saim I am Salad and it was amazing... The people we were so friendly and I can't wait to go back to try some of their other stuff"}
{"text":"Food is ok. But got order wrong and just not very bright people working. Takes a lot longer than it should. And overpriced for what you get"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for lunch today and now we both have food poisoning. Thanks, Mad Greens!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! They easily cater to vegetarians and sometimes even remember my order when I visit. I would eat there every day if I could afford it. Yes, the parking lot is super crazy and sometimes hard to find a spot."}
{"text":"Came mid week after searching for healthier alternatives for lunch. Instantly I was attracted to the healthy menu.   Opted to make my own with spinach as my base with 4 toppings and my choice of honey mustard as my dressing. Also opted the mint juice.   The salad was filling and the dressing was light in taste but not weak. The juice was delightful.  Overall, 4 stars is accurate."}
{"text":"This place makes amazing salads! They are a little $$ but use good ingredients that aren't cheap - yummy white chicken  I've been 3 times and haven't been disappointed  in any salad I have gotten.  Not to mention their rice crispy treats to die for"}
{"text":"It's a freshly made salad with calorie counts displayed! What more could you ask for? They make it right in front of you and you can modify as you see fit as they make it."}
{"text":"This goes for ALL Mad Greens.  why Why WHYYYY must restaurants have salad dressing that include SUGAR in their ingredients?  All these restaurants that market themselves as \"healthy\"...and then load their offered foods with sugar, high fructose corn syrup...hydrogenated oils...YUCK.  People have no idea. I had to DIG to find the ingredients.    Update:  I am updating my review.  I was a bit harsh as I do want to support \"healthy\" concept fast food places in town.  You can customize all you want here....my frustrations are with some of their dressing options and having to dig into their website to find out exactly WHAT is in the dressing...and in most are \"sugar\".  It does not mention what KIND of sugar or how much sugar.  This is misleading in my opinion.  Many restaurants put sugar in their dressing and they end up being sugar sauce, which, on lettuce, is disgusting in my book and also dangerous to those avoiding sugar at all costs.  However, it's easy to avoid the risk by just getting oil and lemon juice or oil and vinegar...(although their vinegar might have \"sugar\" in it too).  The price of convenience and eating out."}
{"text":"I stopped here on a whim, and I'm so glad I did! Excellent customer service and a fantastic gigantic salad! They were so helpful! Highly recommended if you are trying to eat healthy! They also have a juice bar!"}
{"text":"Been eating from here at least once a week for close to a year. Was always good service & great food. Last 2 visits were terrible. Both occasions my order was made by a new(er) employee, who doused my salad in dressing when I asked for \"medium\". I'd hate to see what she'd do if someone asked for \"heavy\"... Today's salad was also missing the chicken - the primary protein source. So not only did I end up with a terrible tasting salad, but it was also missing one of the most important macronutrients! Thankfully there's a new location at Central & Camelback that's closer to home - just not on my way home from work. But I'll gladly go out of my way so that I'm not spending $10 on a salad that's gonna end up in the trash. I hate to say it, but I hope the employee doesn't last long. She belongs at the register or in the back, chopping ingredients."}
{"text":"Good menu for vegetarians and omnivores alike. Healthy, fresh, and delicious.   Lost one star because they would not warm up the cold meat that they serve on salad. Maybe it's just me but cold steak just isn't very good and they would not simply fire up the stove and throw a few ounces of meat on. I just walked next door and ate at my old standby, Chipotle.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place I really do. The food is delicious, even if a little more expensive due to healthier ingredients.  My family and I have walked here no less than 8 times. I'm dissapointed in service about 70% of time.  The last time I went I had one person in front of me and it took 15 mins for two wraps, which they were out of dressing . I  instantly regretted coming back in  Yet there are 6 employees all doing different things, yet not efficiently.  Other visits the servers spend time searching on the floor for who ordered what with a plate in hand. Its not from the lack of trying, but I see no real order or direction and it is impacting the service drastically for a place that's only semi busy.  This location has so far run out of on seperate occsssions :,kale for a juice, strawberries for a salad, and dressing.   I'll try a few more times because I love the healthy food options. But hope they tighten up the service and process.  *update* just got home with order, no dressing on side as requested for wrap. Bummer."}
{"text":"Omg the warm pita bread is AMAZING  stayed in PHX for the weekend and came here twice- so good!"}
{"text":"If you've been hoping for a healthy option to be added to the 7th & McDowell restaurant corner, this is it. Mad Greens has an extensive salad menu with lots of interesting ingredients and dressings. Some of my favorites are the Doc Holiday salad with chicken & miso sesame dressing, the Don Quixote, which has shrimp & a creamy ginger dressing, and the Soleri, which has unsweetened chocolate, figs, and a spicy prickly pear dressing--it sounds weird but trust me, it's worth a try.  You can also just do a custom salad & pick your own ingredients (or make some modifications to the standard menu options). I like being able to do a mix of greens (like 1/2 kale, 1/2 spinach) as well.  I haven't tried any of their sandwiches or wraps, but I've previously gotten the hummus trio and the Mint Cooler fresh juice and both were delicious.   I should mention that since I work out in the east valley, I've never been here during the (surely insane) central Phoenix weekday lunch rush. I've mostly gotten salads to-go in the evening on my way home from work, and I've never been in line for long.  I do think this place got off to a bit of a rocky start in the first few months is was open, but like other Yelpers have mentioned, management seems to be willing to correct any poor experience. My personal example is that about two months ago I was overcharged for my order and after I realized it, I was a bit annoyed and I submitted feedback on the website. I didn't expect to hear back at all, but the GM emailed me a few days later to say he appreciated the feedback and offered me a free salad on my next visit. Since then I've been here 4 or 5 times and it's been solid -- I'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and the staff as very friendly but when we got our food, my friends food they forgot to put chicken in and then I had a wrap and twice there were sharp bones in it! The first one wasnt a big deal, but two!?!! Be careful if you eat here. I didn't finish my food it was too risky. The chicken is hardly spread throughout the wrap and sits in a big clump and the bottom."}
{"text":"First time going in. Almost felt overwhelmed with options and customizing. I opted for the Ty Cobb salad with a lemonade. The salad was good and filling. The larger size was enough for 2. It came with southwestern chicken, I thought it was ok, but hubby liked it. The lemonade was refreshing! I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"Food was good. Staffer helped me with vegan options. Strange smell though. Maybe their cleaning products. We ate outside."}
{"text":"I go a few times a month. My favorite salad is the Mad Molly Brown. I've tried a couple of their Paninis, but gravitate back to the MMB. I haven't had any luck with the create your own salad. Do not attempt to go here when in a hurry unless you ordered ahead (parking is a bear and the line takes a bit). If they had someone come in and work with them on their assembly/ production line it would be fantastic. They are so inefficient!   So ... I'll keep ordering ahead and taking a friend to circle the parking lot while I run in and pick up :-)"}
{"text":"First time here, tried the Chicken Panini (Annie Oakley)and the sandwich had no flavor. They use good white meat pulled chicken with bacon and Avocado. They need to add an aioli spread or something."}
{"text":"Was a nice lunch. Super friendly, super clean and super quick. Got me a chicken salad and an herbal tea that both really hit the spot!   A lot of the staff are still new, since this place just replaced the old sushi joint. But awesome addition to this shopping corner!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to eat healthy and still have it tasty, this is the place to go. Found this gem walking into chipotle and made a quick decision. Glad I did."}
{"text":"The Siam I Am salad with tofu is tasty! I was hungry but ordered the regular size which was an adequate amount to satisfy me. Hoping they open in the West Valley (i.e., Goodyear)."}
{"text":"I love MAD Greens for a quick and healthy lunch! They have DELICIOUS salads with homemade dressings and unique toppings. You can build-your-own or indulge in one of their tasty creations. Today, I ordered a fresh pressed juice and it was the perfect pick-me-up! In addition to juices and salads, they have wraps, paninis, soups, and more. A little bit of everything to make everyone in your group happy! They also have a wonderful iced tea selection and all natural fountain sodas! If you're in the area and looking for an easy lunch, stop into MAD Greens, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had a great chicken buffalo wrap! Excellent service! They make you feel welcomed. Great clean environment."}
{"text":"This salad shop has turned into a regular for me, it's close to home and convenient but the salads are amazing. I refuse to eat chicken at 99% of the places I eat out at but this is actually really good. You can creat your own or choose from their selection. If you don't want something in the salad they will ask you what you want to replace it with so you still get your money's worth. Speaking of money, it's wildly over priced honestly but not stopping me from coming so that says something. I would have gone 5 stars if it weren't for the jab of knowing just how much the ingredients cost at Safeway. Convenience wins though!"}
{"text":"A bad way to spend $25.   Both salads we got were mediocre. I wouldn't have regretted my purchase as much, though, if the service wasn't so awful.   I came in shortly after they opened, and every employee made it known they had another task to do aside from help me. The entire time the girl with very short hair made my salad, she was having a side discussion with another employee about her house arrest belt she had to wear.   Yikes. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried out this place for the first time and my husband and I will definitely be back. It was very clean and the staff was very friendly.   We ordered the Spicy Bacon Bowl and it was delicious! It's a one size only bowl and it was a pretty large bowl to make you full.   Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch here the other day with a BOGO offer. We both had Mad Cuban sandwiches (Panini) which were reasonably good and served with tiny mixed greens salads. If you're into salads, those looked very good. Friendly staff and they give you one of those blinking light vibrator thingies to let you know when your order is ready."}
{"text":"This will definitely be one of my \"go to\" places when I am looking for a healthy option for lunch or dinner.  I enjoyed the strawberry cooler and a Mark Twain salad - pasta with feta, onions, red peppers and cucumbers tossed in a light vinaigrette.  Super friendly staff, clean restaurant, plenty of seating and high quality food."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is so fresh, healthy, and tasty. The soup selection is nice (4-6 per day) and they change.  The salads are killer. Why? Because you choose EXACTLY what you want.  This place is fast (provided you can find parking nearby, which is VERY difficult).   Oh and try the Horseradish Ranch. Lovely!"}
{"text":"Went in today for the first time and ordered a wrap. Not bad, but nothing to really brag about for $9. Good, healthy, quality food!"}
{"text":"tried mad greens this afternoon with my SO while staying in the area.  i had the da vinci salad (with a couple minor changes) and my husband ordered the mad cuban. salad greens were fresh and quantity was  generous; i asked for dressing on the side, which was done, but then the salad guy forgot to give me the dressing!  the ginger soy dressing was really good.  my husband's panini was good but cheese was not melted.  the avocado hummus was nothing to write home about.  iced tea was  brewed and tasted fine.  bathrooms were clean and so was the dining area but will probably try another salad place for satisfying green cravings."}
{"text":"I expected more for cost.  I ordered 1/2 Mad green side salad with 1/2 Annie Oakley panini.  Salad was ok, dressing tasted like slightly flavored mayonnaise. There was barely enough avocado in either salad or panini.  The panini was flavorful.  Again, not quite enough food for the buck but ok if you're in a mood for a fresh panini!"}
{"text":"I know I'm a little late on the is review... But my experience here was really sub par. First off I ordered plain chicken, since i wanted a vinegarette dressing. I got some Mexican type seasoned chicken... It was terrible with my dressing option. My biggest issue is that I had ordered a large salad, I received the small one. Since I was not provided a receipt, I had to go up and ask for one to see what I was actually charged for.  I saw several ppl leaving the counters with these huge salads. It cost my husband and I almost $30 to eat salads and sandwiches...neither of us were impressed, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Came to try for the first time, be aware they close at 9:00 not 10:00 like they have advertised here on Yelp.  Of course I get here and they are locked up.   This is obviously frustrating, guess I'll just stop by fry's and make my own salad."}
{"text":"Went in for a late lunch, Miguel was working and was extremely friendly and helpful especially considering he was having to work Christmas Eve. The Don Quixote and Cesar were excellent and Miguel really was great at helping us customize and get exactly what we wanted. Overall great salads at a fair price, definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Dropped in and ordered 3 salads to give them a try.   Siam I Am, Poncho Villa and Don Quixote.  Barf!  Barf!  Barf!  The Siam I Am must have had fish sauce in the dressing.  The Poncho Villa dressing was too spicy and the quinoa didn't help the salad.  The Don Quixote was the least barfy, but the dressing had some weird flavors.  At $10 per salad, I won't be wasting any more money there.  Also, the ingredients the servers use are sitting UNCOVERED out in the open before they do the assembly...  There is only a sneeze guard to protect from the public, not the workers..."}
{"text":"Here's a great story. My wife and I zoomed over to Chase field on Saturday, June 30th because I really wanted a D-backs gym bag. We didn't want to hang around the ball park for 2 hours until the game started so we decided to find someplace close to downtown where she could get a safe, gluten free meal. Mad Greens always pops up on gluten free choices so we went to 7th ave and McDowell for dinner.  I got the Mark Twain and my wife got the Southwest bowl. My entree was half pasta half greens and was totally delicious. Just the right amount of dressing and I substituted edamame for cucumber. The chicken in both of our dishes was great. Here's the fun part. The restaurant shares a back patio with 4-5 other restaurants. It was a touch too warm to eat outside but if you want a great little place and have indecisive eaters, try Mad Greens on 7th Ave!  Oh. PS. The fountain drinks are very unique.  I had root beer, but there are choices and some really great flavors.  Go give this place a try."}
{"text":"I decided since I was going to torment my body by drinking green on St. Patrick's Day in a couple weeks, I had better prepare my body for it by eating green; and the one place I knew I would get great portions for it would be at Mad Greens. This was one of two great locations in Downtown Phoenix; I opted for this location on 7th Ave just south of McDowell. Once inside, the staff were ready and waiting to get my order going for me; each salad is made-to-order and to my liking. You can either pick out a pre-determined variety, or even build your own salad! They also do wraps and other items, and they're all natural & healthy.   As quickly as I walked in, they were just as quick and happy to get it fixed & ready for me. I also got a drink, which was a Prickly Pear soda; not something you can get at a lot of places, and it was tasty!! Next time, I'll have to get my order for here, just so I can get a couple more fills.. =9  The only sticking point would be the price being a bit on the high side, but the quality is there."}
{"text":"If you've never heard of Mad Greens, picture Subway's concept of sandwich artistry and apply it to salad making. They have a menu if salads, sandwiches, and rice bowls. The salads are made to order, but are customizable. Prices range around $10-12 per meal at this place, a little on the pricey side for \"fast food\", but without the guilt and artery clogging grease.   Their salads have quirky names like Edgar Alan Poe and Doc Holliday (both delicious) and I highly recommend their Mad Spice (a blend of salt, pepper, crushed red peppers, and other secret spices). I purchased the Mad Spice seasoning and I use it on everything from avocado toast to pizza because it is that versatile. Currently on a rice bowl kick, which I enjoy the Buddha bowl with piri piri shrimp, but suggest going easy on the onions if you are going to be in anyone's personal space that same day.   Customer service is average-good, as they are almost always busy and trying to move the line quickly, but they get the job done. Mad Greens is overall a great place to pick up a quick, healthy meal. I just wish their prices were a bit more reasonable, but I guess that's the cost of convenient, fresh, healthy foods these days."}
{"text":"I love finding healthier options to eat, but I was disappointed at the menu choices. It's mostly salads, and I wasn't in the mood for that and everything else was just kinda boring sounding. I ordered the Annie Oakley panini and it was okay. Seriously nothing special. The wraps didn't sound very appetizing either. Maybe I'll come back when I'm in the mood for a salad?"}
{"text":"Completely underwhelmed. I paid $19 for two mediocre salads. Waaaaaay overpriced. I can get two full meals, two sides and two drinks for that at just about any other place nearby."}
{"text":"Two out of three times were not so great experiences. The two guys were new and seemed flustered. Long line piling behind me. One of the guys didn't wear gloves. The pita warmer wasn't working right away so Ariana stepped in and gave us a free drink for the inconvenience and kept checking on us. The other staff just looked at the ground like we weren't there and didn't want to know what and if there was an issue. The salads are great but very slow service. AND for a salad that came w meat, I asked for more veggies as an alternate, and they charge for anything more than two extra veggies you request! Doesn't make sense but ok! Poncho Villa salad rocks!  THANK YOU, Ariana, for being so helpful and kind!"}
{"text":"The hummus trio was really bland. It tasted like cardboard. I feel like hummus is pretty simple to make and add flavor to. Try the hummus at pita jungle instead if you want some with flavor."}
{"text":"Good salad for a fare price.  Quick and easy.   Fresh ingredients.   Nothing exceptional,  just good.  A nice alternative to the burger and fries world we live in."}
{"text":"Expensive salads, really prefer Salad N Go as they have a couple of salads I love and they're under $6. This place, after looking at the menu and talking to the gentleman behind the counter, didnt seem to have what I wanted. So I gave the Caesar a try with some Southwestern chicken. It was good, around $9 for a larger salad. Not sure if it was better than Salad N Go sadly. Service was good, very clean too. When I return I may try one of their wraps."}
{"text":"Ordered the salad and wrap. Don't get food from here unless you want to waste your money. For ten dollars you get a small flavorless salad with flavorless sauce and old lettuce. You'd be better off making your own salad"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here instead of five guys next door.  Great healthy choice.  Prices aren't bad, between 8.50 to 12.00 for most things.  They offer a variety of salads, paninis and wraps, with options.  They also have a juice bar.  I ordered the edgar allen poe.  Delicious.  My wife had the hummus trio and replaced the pita with spinach leaves.  Also delicious.  The hummus is very tasty...roasted garlic, spicy avocado, and roasted beet.  You can also order online and pick up at the register.  No wait. Definitely a great choice.  They also cater!  I wish they had one in my home town."}
{"text":"Nothing but positive comments , quick & friendly service, lots of food options, clean sitting areas, and I love that they have different kinds of drinks available other than your regular fountain drinks ! Ordered a salad which was fresh & delicious."}
{"text":"This place was so cute! It's in downtown Phoinex and it's so yummy! I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a fast healthy option! I had the BLT wrap and it was super good! My boyfriend had the cob salad and he added their special blend of spices and he loved it!! Such a cute atmosphere! It was so nice we were able to sit outside!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place.  It was clean, service was prompt and ingredients were fresh.  But flavor was severely lacking.  Loaded potato soup tasted of nothing besides potato...not even salt...salad dressing was bland.  Juices..we each got a detox drink & I'm a big fan of kale drinks usually, but this one was bad. Again it was bland and tasted more of celery than kale.  Couldn't even drink it.  :("}
{"text":"Had the Cuban panini and a bowl of chicken tortilla soup.    Priced a bit on the premium side at $10+  Food was middle of the road.  Nothing noteworthy at all.    Inside the establishment reminded me of a Chipotle.    Any more middle of the road and it would need stripes down the middle."}
{"text":"Our office had Madgreens catered just the other day. I think there wraps were amazing. BUT they have these Carmels with salt. You can actually taste the salt. I went back there today to buy some more. They have the best customer service! Rachel R helped me count my Carmels then because I bought so many gave me a discount without my asking! Talk about going the extra! I am addicted to the Carmels but will definitely be back to by more very soon to buy more they are delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience with fantastic healthy foods to choose from!!!  Salads Sandwiches Piannis Wraps... Made fresh and fast, the possibilities are endless and so are the flavors.  There organic cane sugar craft soda fountain is awesome and takes me back to my childhood.  Marley the Founder and his team were extremely welcoming with great recommendations which we greatly enjoyed!  This place is a definite must in my book.   PS You have to try the hummus trio"}
{"text":"The service here is always great. They ask if you want any substitutions with your meal and always have great suggestions.  I haven't tried many items but I always crave the Mark Twain! It's so good I can't get myself to order anything else.   I lied, the Dionysis (Greek Salad) is the salad version of Mark Twain (Greek Pasta Salad) and it's really great too!"}
{"text":"I'm always hesitant to order a salad at any type of dining establishment out of fear that I'm selecting the cheapest to make but most expensive to order item on the menu (aka the dumbest choice). I've been to this location about six times and each time I feel comfortable with the $9 I'm paying for a salad. I feel like the salads I've ordered have been worth the money spent. I have not experienced the 3 olive (tomato, onion, et cetera) rule employed by Subway and other \"make your own\" places - I hope this never changes!"}
{"text":"Manager Yuri needs training in customer service and how to read. I bought the promotional refill tumbler, excited because I only come here on my lunch breaks for the soda that has real sugar. I never purchase food here.  When I purchased the tumbler I asked to make sure the refills were 99 cents without a food purchase. I came in today, all excited to use my cup for the second time, and  Yuri tells me that she can't honor the refund without a meal purchase. I said, \"No, that's not what I was told when I purchased.\" I then asked for a refill on the tumbler if I wasn't going to be able to use it for my ENTIRE reason for purchasing.  I asked Yuri to show me where on the sign does it say that I have to purchase food on the tumbler's promotional sign.  She picked it up, read it out loud to everyone in the store, trying to prove her point, but started to lower her volume when she realized she was just proving my point.  No where did it say that I have to purchase food (I have posted the picture).   I asked for a refund. She refused, saying she just can't. Can't or won't? Offer customer service!  Yes, I got loud and frustrated and angry, who wouldn't. She proceeded to say \"I'm just telling you how it is.\"  In the middle of us arguing, police officers arrived. To my surprise, they actually facilitated and had Yuri write her name and store number and provide me with her higher ups information.  I have a call in now.   While I am taking a moment to complain, I will have to compliment the server with the purple hair.  She is always a delight and smiles and compliments me.    This is a big let down to someone who searches and searches for a cheap way to find beverages that don't contain hfcs."}
{"text":"Going into this place I thought it was going to be some nasty salad restaurant but I was pleasantly surprised to find they actually have really good food. I got the Mark Twain and absolutely loved it. All the workers are extremely friendly. The only thing I would change is some of the workers don't know what goes in certain salads and mess them up a tad. Other than that it was perfect, will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Keep in mind, this place recently opened so the few snags I mention will hopefully be addressed and adjusted...  Had the BLT wrap and Sam I Am salad this evening along with a fountain drink (see comments about the sodas they have!)  BLT wrap was average. I would say it was a bit shy on ingredients and too loosely wrapped. Most wraps I've had in the past from other establishments are packed full and tightly wrapped. For the money, I expected more. Employee seemed to struggle a bit with wrapping it.  Sam I Am Salad: I ordered a small salad with extra dressing. Got a large salad with hardly any dressing on it. Not sure where the disconnect was. Quinoa was really odd...soggy and stuck together in little balls and strands. Way too mushy.  Sodas: the soda fountain drinks they have rock!! All natural and creative - not the typical Coke or Pepsi products. Had the black cherry soda which was fabulous!  Staff: very friendly and helpful staff despite the wrap and salad snafu. Seems like the queue is a bit awkward when ordering and paying. People were backed up along the counter area.   Location: clean, modern and well designed with some community tables:   Perhaps a few more weeks of being open will help tighten up the menu and behind the counter service and food quality.   Good to see a healthy alternative to typical fast food joints in that area."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is perfect. Delicious. Fresh. Clean. Phoenix needed this place and we are so lucky to have it. Does the patio and amazing food get more perfect? Don't think so!"}
{"text":"I come here often for my Lunch break, and the food is fast, tasty, and healthy. The staff is always friendly and accommodating as well. It is a bit pricey however, and the parking lot is congested, but other than that I cannot recommend MAD Greens enough."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Very satisfying and filling.  I get the Pancho Villa with Piri Piri shrimp and add cilantro and crunchy garbanzo beans."}
{"text":"This location of MAD Greens is absolutely AMAZING!!! I work in the area so I eat here at least three times per week. Most of the staff members know me by now and I look forward to seeing them when I get my lunch. I have tried just about all of their salads off the menu and they are some of the BEST salads that I've had. The salads are all so tasty that I can't pick a favorite. All of their dishes are very healthy and tasty at the same time. The staff here is wonderful! They are super friendly, customer service oriented, and they take their time answering your questions just to make sure they make your salad just the way you want it. I am very pleased with the food, service, cleanliness of the location, and the staff! Thank you for opening this wonderful restaurant in my work area! :) You make my work week more enjoyable because I know that I will be eating very good! :) - Anabela"}
{"text":"Really? Was that supposed to be a \"fresh\" salad? I don't know what is used to prolong the \"appearance\" of fresh apples, but the apples I just ate had no flavor and a strange texture. Also, the salad was all of a sudden spicy, when this particular salad (I've had it before) never has been (and not spicy in a good way). For $13.00+ this salad was very disappointing and seemed like it's components were unnaturally trying to be kept fresh...but wierdly weren't. Dressing was not so great either. This salad was maybe worth $5.99 on a good day....where you have no other choices and you're starving."}
{"text":"Mad greens really hit the spot today! The Pancho Villa is where it's at. (Add avocado).  Crisp greens, chicken, pepita seeds, corn with a creamy cilantro dressing and quinoa. So good. I ordered the regular size salad and it was more than enough. It kept me fueled up for the rest of the day! I also guzzled the \"wake up\" juice. I was expecting more ginger for the wake up zinger. This juice was tasty but definitely on the sweet side. I'd definitely grab a bite here again if I loved or worked in the area."}
{"text":"This was a really amazing addition to the 7th Ave. and McDowell corner! It needed an option that wasn't full of fried and fatty foods, and this was it.  I have only been one time, and I can say my first experience was a solid A-!   Positives:  I ordered online (super convenient) for pick-up, and my salad was prepared fresh.  The food was top quality, and prepared just as I asked it to be.  The pick-up line was quick and efficient.  The salad was absolutely delicious, and the ingredients were great.  I did get a little grief about asking for my salad to be chopped, but the girl behind the counter reluctantly agreed and I appreciated the flexibility.    Negatives:  THE PRICE.  I paid $11.80 for a salad with spinach and romaine lettuce, mixed with citrus chicken, celery, carrots, edamame, red onion and miso sesame dressing and NO DRINK.  It was delicious, no doubt about it, but I don't know how I could justify eating an $11.80 salad very frequently, especially one that really is not very big, even for the large size. THE PARKING. There is next to no parking in the parking lot, and I had to circle around quite a few times before one of the 10 minute parking spots opened up.  If you're hoping to be in and out of the whole area very quickly, this might not be the location for you.    I will definitely come back, but I couldn't afford for it to be a regular spot."}
{"text":"Have gone to the N. Scottsdale by my work for the smoothies but never tried any food until tonight at this location. The parking here is pretty bad during rush hour but they had only one couple sitting inside so most were in the other restaurants.  Most of the salads sounded good and I went with the Siam Iam. I told the guy who took my order, to hold the onions and again the girl who was preparing it to hold the onions...You can guess it; they put onions in the salad.  I had maybe 4 small strips of pulled chicken in the whole salad and the ginger dressing is not a good match for it.  I told her to not put too much dressing and glad I did. It was almost $10 for the small size so I won't be getting that salad again but will try some other items."}
{"text":"The salad was good.  I got a Ty Cobb.   They need to step up their blue cheese game.   Not a single chunk of cheese."}
{"text":"This place was easily located on 7th Ave and McDowell. I was happy  I was able to park and go inside to pick up my meal. Being that downtown parking is hard to find. Their salad and drink choices where delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpful. This is official my favorite salad place."}
{"text":"I am wary of places like this as it always seems salad-based restaurants are doomed for failure for a variety of reasons.  I decided to give this place a try anyway and I was very pleasantly surprised.  I had their version of a ceasar salad and I was pleased with both the quantity and the quality.  The folks were nice, the salad was filling, and I will likely revisit this place to try something new!"}
{"text":"Service today was really bad. The order taker was just staring at me as she took my order and didn't ask the correct questions there seemed to be a lot of confusion. Service here has progressively declined since opening and they never quite seemed organized but it seems to have gone over the edge now.   Hope they get better soon!   Oh ya and the trash has two sorting holes for compost and recycle waste.... But only one can underneath!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Mad Greens a 3 star rating not because I had a bad experience, but because I don't frequent salad/\"healthy eating\" places so I can't picture myself coming coming here often. Since this place is so close to work then I would come here for a quick and easy lunch on a busy work day.    During my visit here I noticed that the place was super clean and they have ample seating. Customer service was also great and the minute I entered all of the staff greeted me. My order, which was the spicy Caesar wrap and a fountain drink, were good. The wrap was bigger than I expected and wasn't able to finish it in on sitting."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a healthier fast food option! I got the Mad Cesar salad and it was very good! There is a nice outdoor seating area that has shade covers. I will definitely come to this place again!"}
{"text":"Big fan of the healthy alternative for lunch in the midst of all the Fatty McFat-Fat restaurants down town for lunch. Awesome that they buy local as well.  Not the place for the \"Dollar Menu Dude\"; but the atmosphere and staff are always super chill.  I did have to let the cute lil manager know that he needs to run it by the marketing department, that the music is oddly diverse for the working professional. (This conversation was instigated when a cover of the Back Street Boys, I Want it That Way, came on) Yes a cover.  If we can take that outta rotation while I am eating my quinoa, I won't tease the manager next time. Let's keep it healthy for the ears too."}
{"text":"I've been to MAD Greens a few times. It is ok. 3 negatives for me:  1. Unclear naming of menu items 2. Over priced  3. Ok food I probably won't go back since there are similar fast casual restaurants nearby that offers better food/value."}
{"text":"I came here for their grand opening and was happy with my experience. The first time I tried MAD Greens was a few weeks prior at their Hilton Village Yelp Elite event, which was a good time. I knew I would order the Don Quixote salad because it is so delicious and it's one of the pricier salads on the menu because of the shrimp, so might as well get it for free, right? I waited about 45 minutes in line when I arrived at 11:20am, but it was worth it. The workers were great and the atmosphere was lively. I took my salad and mixed iced tea drink to work and had an excellent dinner. I love the variety of toppings to choose from and their MAD spice is the perfect addition to any salad, giving it an extra kick. I appreciate that their food is local and they use whatever is in season, ensuring optimal freshness. I look forward to coming back and using my bogo coupon!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I loved everything clean, great service, huge portions.  Good wad great loved the lemonade."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to get a quick salad with amazing topping combos. I love The Quixote Salad and would definitely recommend this to anyone who has a taste for spicy seasoning."}
{"text":"Really fresh salads and yummy garlic hummus.  My kids likes the grilled cheese and fruit cup.  We ordered a couple of the fresh juices, a little pricey for being made earlier in the day.  The hummus comes with pita bread if you like.  They also give the option for spicier salads with spicy avocado and mad spice.  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"The only good that comes out of it, is the coke that has real sugar instead of syrup and there ice. HA. I mean 10 bucks for a salad ? Sure it's good but the hype is way over dramatic. Your basically paying for the \"home made dressing\" which - just make one at home. Even if you don't know how to cook. The so called \"shift lead, lower manager\" whatever, her name is Yuri. And multiple times has she had an ugly , disgusting attitude. I get the whole bitch face thing but you can't blame it on that when your body language is saying your annoyed and what comes out of your mouth. Oh and rolling your eyes. It's not professional. It gets me how these people get to that position but there the rudest ones in the company. Everyone else there is NICE. I was so uncomfortable that normally I call someone out and ask if there okay, but it was so harsh you didn't even wanna deal with her. Someone needs to say something to her. Seriously the facial expressions & body language are ugly . The mouth , just shocking. When I told one of the girls that she is mean, she said \"ya she can be mean sometimes\" LOL like what?! She looks miserable working there. Anyways she is just rude."}
{"text":"Came here for their Grand Opening/Free Salad event earlier in the week.  I also attended their Yelp elite event a few days prior.  That's how much I liked this place.  Their juices are UNBELIEVABLE and the salads are delicious too.  Oh, and did I mention the tofu?  Probably some of the best I've ever had.  Pick a salad or make your own...everything is made to order and is super fresh.  Feel free to add or subtract ingredients or swap out the dressings/protein to suit your taste.   I also met one of the owners of the company (Marley) who is a really kind hearted, generous guy.  He loves his business and his employees and it shows.  The restaurant is immaculate and the employees are all really friendly.  They open at 7am so you can get your juice on for breakfast (Yum!).  Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Love MAD greens, great variety and create your own options!  Wish there was a location closer to us though.  Everything healthy is either Scottsdale, Tempe, or mid to downtown Phoenix, so annoying, we eat healthy near the I-17 and Greenway too!!!"}
{"text":"Very good! Laid back atmosphere ... Friendly staff. Seems pricey, but you get a lot and it's fresh ... Not just salads ... Plenty to choose from. They provide online ordering."}
{"text":"Great salad fast service great menu options great prices needs fresher romaine parking is another down side"}
{"text":"Tried MAD Greens for the first time today.  What a bummer after experiencing their competitor, Salad & Go... I appreciated the cleanliness of the store and the friendly employees...  I would give 5 stars for that, but I am SO bummed out that the lettuce is pre-packaged pre-cut lettuce. The flavor is SO much different when lettuce is not freshly cut at the store.  Trust me, I understand the labor cost associated with a change like this, but it would be to your company's benefit. Another positive -  the Caesar dressing is extremely robust and tasty."}
{"text":"Was kind of excited about this.  The menu looked good, it was nearby.  Decided to order some carry out.  I quickly decided I wanted to order the MAD Cuban Panini.  I love cuban sandwiches and figured it wouldn't be exactly right but worth trying.  My dining companion decided on the Marilyn Monroe Panini.  Online order.  Apparently this location only has 3 of the 5 listed paninis.  Marilyn was not among them.  Strike One.  Website could be better.  So the next choice was the Siam I Am Wrap.  I was about to order and she asked how many calories.  The handy calories link immediately showed how many, over 600 calories.  But it offered the opportunity to remove items.  Take out the peanuts and it is much more reasonable.  So go to order that.  First pain was that there were 20-eleven choices for different types of chicken, etc.  Almost punted but found the recommended defaults and chose them.  Then I clicked on the \"customize\" button and found that there was no choice to eliminate peanuts or anything else.  What was the point of the option on the calories page?  THE WEBSITE IS REALLY BAD.  She decided to do the cuban as well, really wanted to go somewhere else but knew I wanted to try the Cuban.  The parking lot was full of people trying to park.  My choices were to block traffic on 7th Avenue or park in front of somebody's house on the side street.  I chose the latter.  All those people in the parking lot must have been going to Chipotle or Five Guys because MAD Greens was pretty much empty.  My order was ready and they had gotten it right except for ignoring the bag of chips, but I caught that.  We tried the Hummus Trio.  The cut up pita pieces were a nice touch.  The three hummus varieties were pretty bland.  She was the beet fan but was not impressed.  The Cubans needed work.  I knew it used chicken instead of pork, which almost worked but there was too much chicken.  There was not enough pickle and I guess that a Cubano doesn't really work as a panini, the bread needed to be thinner.  The only real win was the bag of chips, Jalapeño Tortilla Chips, which were great."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 salads online for pickup, 10 minutes before I arrived. But when I went in to pick up the order, neither salad was ready & the one team member had a line of other customers. (There were 4 people working at the time.) Once the line was taken care of, I was told my order would be made momentarily. In all, I waited 25 minutes for an online order. Once home, both salads were made incorrectly, neither salad had avocado & the second salad was had NO chicken (which is ironic since the BOTH salads were supposed to come with avocado AND chicken). LESSON: If you go to Mad Greens, don't do an online order, you'll end up waiting in line anyway. And if you want to make sure your order is done right, make sure you pay attention while your order is made."}
{"text":"Second time we ordered from here.  Second time the order was wrong.  We wanted it to be good, and so we gave them a second try.  We didn't change the salad at all.  We didn't ask for anything special.  The Don Quixote is supposed to come with piri piri shrimp and a ginger dressing.  It came with chicken and balsamic vinegarette.  Then, to top it off, there is a phone number on a sticker on top of each salad.  It says to text a number with either \"Happy\" or \"Sad\"  But you guessed it, that doesn't work either.  I sent the response in the format requested and received a response back, \"Sorry, I don't recongnize that selection.  Text in \"Happy\" or \"Sad\"."}
{"text":"This is a really nice salad restaurant. The menu items are all pretty healthy. Everything is tasty. The staff is attentive & friendly and he prices are inexpensive. I also love that they have green juices without high sugar fruits, as well as sugary versions too. ;)"}
{"text":"So many options available! I loved my steak salad (can't remember the name of it). They were patient with me having never been before and made several suggestions to try and simplify the process.  I didn't try their soda fountain, but there look to be several different/cool flavors that I'll definitely return to try out.  The larger size was HUGE and I struggled to finish the whole thing, but when I set a goal, I usually follow through. ;)"}
{"text":"Came in here because I needed something quick but healthy. Got the Saim I Am salad, enjoyed it overall. Wish I hadn't had to spend 12 bucks on it. When he told me the total I kind of felt my lungs collapse into themselves. Was not expecting that price, but oh well. They gave me a coupon to fill out a survey to get $5 off my next order and so that'll have me back at least one more time.  The employees were pleasant. The boy that helped me made sure I wanted each on the salad before adding them, which I appreciated. They suggested I put the mad seasoning on my salad and while I don't like spicy stuff I sprinkled a little on my salad. It wasn't bad, but like I said I don't like spicy. Overall, not a bad experience over all. Price is the only thing that will keep me from coming."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since I just moved to the willo. I have two toddlers. Show up and got excited about all the tasty options! I order what I believe was called the Don Quixote salad. It sounded amazing! Then I go on and ask for a kids ham and cheese sandwich. She asked if I wanted the fruit or cookie and I said fruit but if she could add two fruit cups since I have two kids. And I said \"even if you have to charge me for it\" I wasn't expecting or wanting anything free. So she says \"I'm not sure if I can cause there's no charge button for it\" so I just couldn't understand why she couldn't add a fruit cup to my order and was hoping she would do something about it. But I thought ok I guess they will share it. Then I ask if they could add a condiment to the sandwich since she had said its only ham and cheese nothing else. She then again says \"sorry but there's no charge button for that either.\" Seriously!? She had told me it was half a sandwich. They can't spread a little mayo without charging me for it? Anyways I just couldn't continue with my order because as mentioned I wasn't even wanting anything for free, just hoping for a more customized order without being told there's no charge button for it. So we decided to simply cancel the order and walk over to chipotle. It was just easier. :/"}
{"text":"was there at 7 pm on 2/8. salads are decent. customer service sucked. waited forever for panini. brought number to counter to ask for food they had no clue what I ordered. what's the point in giving a number if it's not connected to an order? the child (worker) behind the counter asked me twice if I was eating in or out and then forgot to give me drink cups. no apology no sorry. won't go back."}
{"text":"At first glance the menu is overwhelming.. there are so many options for building your own salad. But hey, in America we love options!   Get carried away.. no matter what you order or build, the ingredients are fresh and tasteful. I went for the large, didnt finish it, and had leftovers for a snack later on.   Oh, ill be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients in a refreshing food concept (eat well, affordably and fast).  They make all their own dressings and were very helpful for the two allergies in our party.  Friendly service and tasty food!"}
{"text":"Delicious salads!!! Logan always remembers my order. I have become an addict. Can't wait until you open your Arrowhead location."}
{"text":"This was the first time trying Mad Greens and I had the Pomona. It was delicious; I ate every last bite! The service was great, the ingredients very fresh and a favorite among busy locals. I'll definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"I am a fan! They have a range of salad greens that are good and flavorful. Nice combination of juices. There hummus taste so good and the presentation is as mad! I love this place. It's right at the corner of 7th Ave and McDowell and around so many other food places."}
{"text":"Appreciated how Mad Greens gives the public a sampling of the food they provide at their Grand Openings! Another thing to love besides their service is the usage of local ingredients!   I got the Crazy Ivan which was a salad of baby greens, roasted peppers, pumpkin seeds, goat cheese, roasted beets and a miso sesame vinaigrette. I'm not a fan of beets so I had those left off, but also found they left off the goat cheese as well- bummer. The salad was delicious even without the goat cheese! Flavorful, light and the pumpkin seeds added a great crunch. The flavor profiles of their salads are well thought out. The greens of the day were also from Buckeye! The free drink that came with their free salad allowed you to choose from their Maine Root soda fountain or their flavored teas. I like Maine Root's mission and liked their Mexicane Cola in terms of flavor and sweetness factor, their Mango tea was fruity and sweetened with honey if you're looking for a non-soda option.   The service for their grand opening was spot on. There was a long line, but expected. Just a small hiccup in their assembly line which was apparent that they were still in training, but enjoyed how friendly, quick and informative the staff was here. So happy to have Mad Greens closer to where I live and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been here once and visited the Tempe location twice.  Since my most recent visit was here (and I only review franchises once), I thought I'd give Phoenix my shout-out.  First off, I really like the ideology behind MAD Greens (having hear it directly from the founders, I'm confident we're on the same page).  I like the fact that they focus on freshness and flavor.  I really like that they source what they can locally.  That's so commendable (though it really should just be standard practice...oh, capitalism/consumerism). In my visits, I've always found their food to be both flavorful and fresh.  MAD Greens makes dining out as a mixed dietary-needs couple very manageable.  Not only that, but there is no challenge in finding healthy options.  So, if you're looking for fresh vegetables and something for both the omnivore and vegetarian (or even vegan), then MAD Greens is a great choice.  As to service and price, we've never had any troubles with either.  I've always felt service was friendly and appropriate.  We've also never had any problems with our orders, though I'm confident that they would be easily resolved (especially with the very responsive management, evident on this yelp page).  As to cost, I feel it's fair.  For fresh food, you're going to pay slightly more, and that's the case here, too, Now, with that, I've always left full, and the bill hasn't hung as a regret in my mind.  Specific to this location, parking is an issue, but so it is for any place in this area.  It's a popular spot, so parking is also \"popular\" :)  Just don't give up -- you'll find a spot somewhere!  If you haven't tried it yet, give it a shot.  MAD Greens has my recommendation!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite salad places, or at least it used to be. Customer service truly makes a difference and the lady I had make my salad today had none. She made my friends order wrong, and mine. Both asked for it to go and she put mine in a bowl to dine in. I think I'm going to stick with the Tempe location."}
{"text":"I did it! Same day different location ...at work and home with hubby. I love the Don Quixote and we tried the hummus and pita. My honey had the Cuban with the soup and curry salad ... Awesome sides and big! I guess we will have leftovers. I was a little sad to find that the online choices are different and we had to order soup after the online order. Everything was ready. We want the green chili to rotate through!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to get juice! Very happy with my green juice, I added green apple and lemon to the detox juice. Tasted great!"}
{"text":"Sweet location. Super easy to find and awesome staff. I love when employees give me suggestions  on how to make my food taste that much better!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"They are great!  Love the food.  Hummus is better than some middle eastern places.  I'm not a salad person but wow Tried one of their salad and it was phenomenal :)  Hummus trio was something to try.  They forgot to not put bacon my sandwich but then gave me two sandwiches with no bacon to correct their mistake and I was embarrassed :&   A+  Great staff great people super clean.  Refreshing foood!!!!"}
{"text":"The food tastes good but, they really want you to open your wallet wide and some portions are somewhat skimpy if your hungry.  The staff didn't seem real friendly but, they like to collect a bundle of money for a simple meal.  Anyway, I liked the garden vegetable soup.  I might like to come back and try some more items.  I wish they had a few other convienient locations besides this one.  All of the others are real far away and through some of the worst traffic to get to.  In any case, I like that they have a natural soda selection with no GMO high fructose corn syrup and mercury added. The tea selection is pretty good.  This area is congested and it might be a battle to find parking if you stop here around lunch time."}
{"text":"This is a fast-casual type of restaurant. I've come several times for lunch and will continue to do so.   They have a bunch or pre-designed salads/bowls/wraps or you can freestyle it. Tons of options. I typically get a pre-designed salad and make a couple custom tweaks."}
{"text":"I figured I'd give this place a try and to my surprise, it was amazing! Fresh ingredients and your order is made on the spot. I decided to try the Annie Oakley Wrap with spicy bacon and instead of ranch, I had them put Cilantro Chili Lime dressing. My first bite and I was happy! Sometimes eating at healthy places the food might lack in flavor, but not at this place. I was pleasantly surprised! The crispy bacon, spicy spice, and the creaminess from the avocado - on point!"}
{"text":"Let me start with a disclaimer: the people who run mad greens contacted me about my review to allow me to come back and try another salad on them. Generally, I don't accept this; however, the people who run this restaurant were adamant. I think this is a good business move because it shows that they care about their customers, and it allows people to give them another shot without the risk of having another bad experience. I feel that mad greens is a company that stands behind their product as a result of this interaction, so way to go mad greens!   I went in last weekend to get my salad, and it was very good! The man behind the counter seemed to know what he was doing and he made my salad perfectly. The salad was large and fed me for two meals, staying fresh for several days. This definitely added value to the meal. In addition to the salad, I had the hummus trio, which came with delicious warm pita bread and three different types of hummus that were each very unique. There was a spicy avocado hummus, a beet hummus, and a garlic hummus. My favorite was the spicy avocado, I like that it was just spicy enough without losing that hummus flavor. I think next time I'd get a large order of that one.  I'm glad that I gave mad greens another chance, especially since they're so close to my house. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Mad GreensI choose either this location of the one on Central and Camelback, as I live between both.  Each salad is custom made with the freshest greens and meats available. If I order the large size, there is more than enough for two salads, so I bring half home for later. Have eaten three or four salads, and friends who have come with me have had sandwiches which they love.  Freshly squeezed juices are available bottled. A bit pricey but excellent quality...actually about the same  you would pay in upscale grocers.  Incredible selection of salad dressings. Really, must be twenty or so.  Everyone who works there is attentive, and seem to be happy in their positions.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"I always leave here disappointed for one reason or the other. Most often it's the taste of the salads. There's just something off about them. There  was a very odd mixup with my order, which would have cost me extra and was not what I ordered. I still dont quite understand how this happened, but it seems as though they changed the menu and have not updated them. Atleast that's what the employee said. It's understandable for things to fall through the cracks or get mixed up, but the employee making my bowl was upset about it and directed that towards me.....unacceptable customer service."}
{"text":"They get a little chaotic during the lunch rush but still get you through line pretty quick. I'm not a big salad person but they have really good rice bowls and good soda on the fountain. Definitely worth a try if you haven't been here already."}
{"text":"Went here the other night and ordered a Doc Holiday salad. The salad was absolutely delicious. I recommend it with tofu instead of chicken as their tofu is the best I have ever tasted. Everything was very fresh and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Great salad restaurant for a very reasonable price.  Excellent iced tea (including unflavored black tea) and real sugar soda choices. The staff is very friendly.  A great place to have as a quick go to place for lunch or dinner.  A great value and healthy."}
{"text":"Just order my first salad from this place online. I really appreciated their interactive allergen menu on their website. It gives you a ton of options to choose from for what you can't eat; and then let's you know what's safe/what can be modified/what you should steer clear from. I wish all food places addressed allergens this thoroughly, on behalf of someone who has many intolerances (but luckily no allergens) thank you so much for making my ordering experience as simple as possible. I went with a build my own option and it was very tasty. I knocked off one star because I had an issue with placing my order online and I think the salad is a little over priced. I'll definitely come back regardless of those two downsides though."}
{"text":"This was my first time so I've yet to formulate any definitive opinions on the food but One more visit and I'll have something worth reading but so far, I'm struggling with portion ratios and free-pouring liquid items ( e.g. Olive oil,lemon juice etc.) without forethought as to how it would affect the overall taste of a salad, if not done mindfully. Of course, I can recognize that this may be a communication error on my end but still- I will order the same salad with the same ingredients and see how it turns out. I think I like this place in the grand scheme of things. This corner definitely needed a salad joint of this caliber. Standby...."}
