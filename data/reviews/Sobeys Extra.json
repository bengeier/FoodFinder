{"text":"The only thing I don't enjoy about this place is the people in the parking lot.

Sobeys in da bomb. Their prepared food section is the best I've ever seen (and living in this area, y'all know I've tried Longos, the old Sobeys, the Superstore, and Weston Produce [RIP]), and its great when you just want to get in and get out. going to the Superstore is such a commitment, it's basically the IKEA of grocery stores. I also feel like a queen when I'm shopping at Sobeys.

BAD: no more club Sobeys :("}
{"text":"Just returned from Sobey's Extra unhappy.  The bakery clerk I dealt with was loud, rude and demeaning.  I've had this treatment at this store more than once but this time I decided to write my review with this in mind.  

The store itself rambles, all angles, which makes it difficult to navigate.  Usually, I visit the meat department and produce (but I can never find much in the produce area), bakery then I leave.   I am not sure what is in the rest of the store it's sort of out of the way.  

The pictures are accurate as they show how dark the store is."}
{"text":"Look out Whole Foods. Sobeys is not letting you into Canada without a specialty food and gourmet grub fight - and us consumers are going to be the sole benefactor of this new next level battle of the grocery giants with Jaime Oliver leading the charge for Sobeys!

The new Sobeys 'extra' concept is a total revamp, with a focus on specialty items and giving each item or genre of food on your grocery list it's own spot in the sun. This ain't your florescent lit-aisle after aisle- \"discount on fish fingers in aisle 3\"- grocery store anymore, it's a living breathing market filled with warm colours, soft lighting, expert displays and specialty EVERYTHING! 

Every aspect of the store has a tactile market feel that brings you in, gets you interacting with the store, it's shelves, displays and various specialty counters. Like the market your grandparents would have gone to, you'd interact and inspect each item before you purchase it. It's no different here. Except, Sobeys wants you to interact with the store itself. For example, sectioning off the dairy items into individual glass door-ed refrigerators which look slick and well polished - asking to be opened so you can grab your pick from behind it.

The flow of the store begs to be shopped, there is no more walking up and down aisles, in Sobeys 'extra' you're led to the next item on your list in a natural flow as you would at a Sunday farmers market.

Why have one counter for all deli when you can break it down into specialty counters, one for cheese and gourmet crackers, and one for deli meats. You can say goodbye to Starbucks, Tim Hortons and McDonalds in stores because at S.e. they're roasting their own beans in store in front of your eyes before they make you your cup of coffee! Amazing!

I also eluded earlier that Jamie Oliver has his stamp all over this place as Sobeys new spokesperson. You see his books, his gourmet items and recommendations everywhere, as if he was some sort of Grocery Dictator. Hail Leader! *Salutes with organic carrot*

These are a new breed of concept store and thus not everywhere, BUT, if you have a chance to visit Aurora (just off Hwy 404), north of Bayview and Wellington. I recommend that you do - It will blow your mind!"}
{"text":"Adore this place! Even greater than Longo's and the prices seem to be lower. The stock is fantastic but do not expect much if you are a gourmet who eats only Mediterranean food imported directly from Italy or Spain. Anyway, the choice of products is nice but the greatest thing... tadaam! they have started to sell beer! No more rush to the beer store or LCBO when you can find even polish Tatra among a huge selection of Canadian and European beers.
The stuff is always polite and helpful. Though the last time I was asked to show an ID though I'm 33 ))))"}
{"text":"Really like their ramen, it's made to order every time and the portion is huge. The closest next ramen restaurant is at least 30km south, and I must say Sobeys ramen is pretty good! Their other hot soups are pretty good too. 

Unfortunately this Sobeys location does not have much flower selection, like the Sobeys on Bathurst and Rutherford for example. 

The selection is great, many items i cannot find anywhere else are sold here. 
They sell beer at this location, very convenient for one stop shopping."}
{"text":"There aren't too many Sobey's near where I live but there is one close to my work.  I've been here a few times and I'm always impressed.  It's always clean and organized (but in fairness I am sure it doesn't get the same amount of traffic that Loblaws or Walmart does).

They have a huge prepared food section - hot meals, cold meals, sushi, soups etc. The selection is much better than Loblaws (but I like Longos fresh food selection - the hot stuff - better for taste).  

The produce always looks amazing - it makes you want to dive right in and get all those colourful fruits and veggies.  I saw a lot of organic options.  They have a lot of specialty items - this is more their focus - cheeses/delis/breads/produce than the \"normal\" grocery items.  

There is also a small bulk food section - candies/nuts/seeds etc.  I think bulk barn is still better for these types of options but this will do in a pinch if you need a small amount of something.  

This is more of a maze like concept for a store rather than just straight up and down aisle shopping - you can wander around getting a good feel for all it has to offer.  

I noticed also that they have pretty good sales - I'm not sure if they price match as I did find the produce a bit more expensive than other places I shop."}
{"text":"Five star for this location!

Bright, clean, organized, well stocked; all good things in my books. The layout of this grocer is more like a maze but it's fun as you navigate through. The produce is very inviting and colourful. Stacks of baskets for quick in & out'ers. 

The wellbeing section is decent too! Lots of holistic foods, organic goods and vitamins/supplements. I must've gone at the right time because hot damn there were some good sales on things! Keurig cups, cherries, organic cereal, cheese, etc. This Sobeys also carries the hummus (Fontaine Sant√©)  that I adore and love which seems to be a hard to find item in other stores. 

I also found the self checkout really easy to use. The voice over isn't annoying either and it reads you the price of the item as you scan. 

The only thing I'm not too fond of is their pepper wall. It's a great concept but not very practical. They fall if you want to select one from another row beneath. Although, it is appealing to the eyes, I'll give them that. What a sweet way to brush up on your Tetris skills."}
{"text":"I live literally a stones throw from this store.  Really, I have my pick of stores since Longo's and the great canadian superstore are close as well.  I was so happy when their sobeys reopened with a new image to keep the competitive edge.  Great products, fresh produce and meats.  What I love most is the cooking station.  Whenever I visit, I bee-line it for the chefs station.  On a daily basis they have a recipe for you to sample with the recipe print put  and all of the ingredients right there if you want to make it.  I have tried many and they have all been quick, easy and delicious.  I spoke with the manager once and complimented the station idea and Serge the chef who creates the recipes. He told me that it was an investment to bring a chef in, and he was chosen after a six month search.  The only thing I'm not thrilled with is the hot food station.  Tried it a couple of times and thought the food tasted like it had been out too long.  It may be that there is so much to choose from that they can't possibly move it fast enough.    It's still a good option if you are hungry.  Oh, the exception would be the pizza which was good.  All in all, my go to grocery store. :)"}
