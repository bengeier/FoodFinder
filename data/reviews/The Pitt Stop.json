{"text":"1st time to this place. Guy running the shop was nice, rib were well-sized and tender. Apricot sauce is awesome! All the other sauces were good. GF had a pork sandwich w/mashed sweet potatoes which were very good & the Italian vegetable salad which was also very tasty. I had the haluski & cole slaw, both of which were fantastic.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the cuban sandwich. It was definitely done the right way. It was very good and the pork was smoked to perfection. Its not really a good sit-down restaurant because it is small and only has a few tables. It is better to order out. The meat was great but the coleslaw I ordered was bland and too salty. Also, although we were the only people in the place it took us 45 minutes to get our food. I give it three stars because of my experience with the coleslaw, the wait time and also because I was expecting a larger sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times because I live right up the street. With the exception of the soap operas on TV, I love it.  The first time I was there I got the Jorge sauce on a Pittsburgh pulled pork and I haven't stopped. It's coleslaw and fries on the sandwich. The sauce is some of the best I've had.  Locals love this place. It's become my go-to for lunch."}
{"text":"Being a fan of BBQ, I was eager to try this place, since it was new to my neighborhood. The ribs are ok, but a little heavy on the smoke for my taste. Even with the sauce, you still get big smoke flavor, but some may like that. I tried the brisket sandwich once and it just wasn't good to me. There appeared to be no seasoning/rub or anything on it, it was definitely a little tough. I did like the loaded potato salad and the pasta salad. My favorite so far has been the pork belly sandwich. I'll give them another shot, maybe it was a bad day but to be successful and to sustain, he's going to have to produce great food EVERYDAY, not here and there..."}
{"text":"Super Bowl Sunday and we wanted to try Pitt Stop's BBQ for our small party. We placed a preorder on Grubhub, so they'd have it when they opened.  Hours later, our order is mysteriously cancelled and we only found out via email - apparently Pitt Stop cancelled our order with no notice or reason.  Not sure what happened, but we'll have to assume they were in over their heads on a busy day, and thought that cancelling customers' orders without notice was the way to deal with the extra business, which you would think a restaurant would want & be ready for.  It's unlikely we would give Pitt Stop another chance after this fiasco."}
{"text":"Little bbq joint on the main drag in Bellevue.  I often drive past and never stop - but today was different!     Being that I was pressed for time I noticed the sign that read \"Hot BBQ ready to go\".  I walked in and felt like I was interrupting something but wasn't.  The Patrons were locals no doubt and the radio was on real loud- maybe talk radio??  So walking up to the counter.. didn't seem like there was much - but typical choices.  I asked for a recommendation and the \"Pittsburgh Pulled Pork Sandwich\" was the recommendation so I ordered that.   It wasn't fast like I expected..  took about 10 minutes.  While waiting I noticed detailed printed menu on the counter top and was surprised at how much was offered.  It doesn't appear when you first walk in but there is so much more available such as kid's specials, tacos cheese fries, Cuban sandwich etc.    So my sandwich was ready .. it was in a small white foam container and as I picked it up I swear it weighted me down and was at least a pound!  Took it back to work and opened it up at my work station and opened up the lid.  Now this was sandwich.   Fresh cut fries and cole slaw were happy nestled in the pulled pork and even peeking out the sides and for $6.00 !!  That's a fantastic price for this sandwich.   One word describes this sandwich \"Epic\""}
{"text":"I had the cuban, it had bacon instead of ham but was really good.The pulled pork plate was a little too fatty, but their sauce selection made up for it. I will be back to try the brisket soon. Didn't try the wings but they have wing night on Wednesday."}
{"text":"Quiet little hole in the wall with great smoked ribs & a variety of interesting BBQ sauces! Wide variety of sides - the helushki was great! The fries, corn on the cob and Mac&cheese were ok. Brisket was moist but more smokey and well done than I like. We'll be back for the ribs and to try the pulled pork."}
{"text":"I finally got to try The Pitt Stop through their catering at my sister's wedding picnic. It was beautifully presented and everything was delicious! I could have eaten an entire tray of mac and cheese, but thankfully controlled myself a bit. Everyone gave positive feedback and asked about the food. I would definitely recommend trying it out and will absolutely go the next time I'm in the Pittsburgh area!"}
{"text":"Had the ribs, with side of mac chz and beans.   Ribs were dry and flavorless Mac and chz was old looking, dry and flavorless. Beans were from a can. I'm thinking Sysco. And equally terrible.  If all other restaurants in Bellevue burn down, and you've already tried cannibalism then go here and maybe a sandwich won't make you cry.  The bbq sauce was edible, hence the second star."}
{"text":"My first time ordering from here did not impress me. I ordered through Grub Hub:  - brisket plate w/ Mac & cheese and cole slaw  They forgot the Mac & Cheese, but did deliver it (30 minutes later) after I called. I wasn't a fan of the cole slaw and I pretty much love all Cole slaw. The brisket had a nice flavor, but way too much BBQ sauce on it.   Probably wouldn't order from here again. I'll wait for Double Wide to get my brisket!"}
{"text":"I really do need to spend more time in Bellevue with so many great little places like The Pitt Stop popping up.  Young Chef Rich Palmieri owns and operates this small operation right on Lincoln Avenue.  He keeps the menu simple and focuses on the quality with a few main dishes, some sandwiches and a rotating list of sides.   My Mom and I showed up for lunch one day after I had purchased a local Groupon-type deal for half off.  We both ordered main dishes after some debate.  I ordered the beef brisket platter with loaded potato salad and cole slaw as my sides with a corn muffin and a can of orange Fanta to wash it all down.  I had a difficult time deciding on my sauce but Rich was happy to let me try two with my meat.  I requested the honey bourbon because I didn't think I could go wrong there.  I also tried the apricot because I like a little sweet with my heat (and this one delivered).  The cole slaw was coarse and crunchy, just the way I like it with my BBQ.  The potato salad was also a hit.  What The Pitt Stop lacks in space and decor it more than makes up for in flavor using locally sourced meats.  It wouldn't be my first choice for BBQ in Pittsburgh but it's good and I can see how an updated review could easily add a 4th star.  I'd recommend takeout as there are only a few tables inside and there is not much atmosphere.  The menu may also not look all that exciting, but The Pitt Stop sticks to a few things and executes them well."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst \"pulled pork\" I have ever been served....basically boiled pork with no discernible smoke flavor, nor, for that matter, much pork flavor.  The chicken had a nice crisp skin, but, again, no smoke flavor whatsoever, and a rather bitter aftertaste.  The sides were bland, the sauces boring.  Do not eat here, even under threat of death."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed in the food quality. The Cuban sandwich that I ordered was completely flavorless. When I order wings, I like for them to be cooked a little harder and to have a slight crunch on the outside. The wings that we ordered from here also seemed as if they weren't the freshest.  Like a previous reviewer stated, don't order from here thinking that you're getting soul food, because you'll be sorely disappointed The pluses do include fast delivery and ordering available via Grub hub."}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday with my father for lunch.  We had noticed The Pitt Stop on our last foray into Bellevue and I was looking forward to trying some BBQ that was close to my home.  We walked into the restaurant and found a place to order in front or us, about 5 tables and a soda cooler.  The menu was behind the glass where you ordered and there was also a whiteboard that had the sides and BBQ sauces that were available listed.  After debating between the pulled pork sandwich and the brisket platter for lunch I ultimately decided on the platter. I ended up choosing sides of Mac and cheese and haluski and the honey bourbon BBQ sauce for my brisket.  My father ended up choosing the fish sandwich and haluski.    We then took a seat and about 15 minutes we heard \"order up\" and I went to the front to grab our food.  I started off by digging into the brisket which is usually my favorite BBQ meat.  Unfortunately about 1/3 of it was pure fat which on top of the smallish portion left me not too happy.  The BBQ sauce was equally disappointing as while I could taste a little sweetness to it, I didn't get much else.  After finishing that up I moved onto my Mac and cheese.  It was cold and consisted of a farfalle pasta in a cheese sauce.  It was an ok Mac and cheese which i think would have benefitted greatly from a cheesier sauce and being warm.  Last but not least was the haluski.  This easily ended up being the best part of the meal as it was piping hot, tasty and soaked in butter.   The bottom line for me is that I might head here again in the future but it wouldn't be my first choice.  My brisket and sauce were definitely underwhelming as was the Mac and cheese but I really enjoyed the haluski."}
{"text":"Had takeout from here for the first time tonight.  My husband and i were skeptical because lived in the south for a few years and it's a BBQ place in Bellevue...   We were blown away!  He had the brisket platter with mac and cheese and cornbread and I had the pulled pork platter with mac and cheese and fresh cut fries.  They also had a buffalo chicken mac n cheese and we decided to give that a try as well.    The buffalo mac was amazing.  Perfectly spicy and creamy... Super yum.    The honey bourbon sauce was very tasty... Spicy and sweet.  the cornbread was nice and warm and had good flavor.    Check this place out.  I haven't had good bbq like this since we were in Memphis."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I had the biggest craving for BBQ yesterday and found the Pit stop was nearby. I ordered the half chicken with loaded brisket fries a side of pasta salad and cornbread. My friend ordered the brisket with mac and cheese and loaded pork fries.  The good: the bourbon BBQ sauce was amazing. Just the right combination of tangy and smokey. The cornbread was perfection! And the brisket was just amazingly tender and moist.  The bad: unfortunately my chicken, though it fell right off the bone, was very dry. I mean...really, really dry. The fries were bitter as though they'd been overdone but were also pretty soggy(chalk it up to it being in takeout containers). The pasta salad had waaaaaaaay too much onion for my liking, combined with the salad supreme seasoning and it was just a very bitter experience.  Overall, I think it has potential. The flavors are there, maybe a little too much. I realize BBQ is bold flavors but unless they're perfected, the experience gets ruined. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again and if I get the BBQ craving again I'd try another place first honestly."}
{"text":"Delicious! Best BBQ I've had in Pittsburgh. My bf and I called in for a to go order. It was ready quickly and piping hot when we picked it up. He got the smoked ribs with red skin mashed potatoes and cornbread. The potatoes in particular were SO good. I got a Cuban with Mac and cheese and green beans. Everything we got was AMAZING. Will definitely be eating there again soon."}
{"text":"I got delivery from them. I ordered the wings, huluski and loaded French fries. All I have to say is Oh My Goodness!! Where has this place been my life? My husband and I are constantly on the look out for a good BBQ place and this place did not disappoint! The customer care was great too. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves flavor!"}
{"text":"New little BBQ place opened in Bellevue.   The menu has Ribs, Chicken, Pulled Pork and Shredded Beef and a few sandwiches and a salad.  Many sides and five or six sauces.   Had a plate of ribs that were nicely smoked, tender and easy to eat off the bone.  Ordered the mild sauce since we were told the Jorge (hot) sauce was very hot.  Ended up getting the hot sauce or the mild is very hot.  The sauce was OK, but hot and had a vinegar flavor. Had a side of Mac N Cheese (which was OK, nothing special), and cornbread.    The interior is painted bright yellow and has 4 tables.  All the tables were in use when we visited.    Facebook: www.facebook.com/pittstopbbq"}
{"text":"After parking the car several times to go to our usual desired restaurant in Bellevue, Grille 565, we had walked right past this little unassuming spot every time. It never looked occupied. And BBQ places in da burgh can be very hit or miss, and usually come and go before I ever think of stepping inside.  Then one day this week, a guerilla marketer slipped a menu into my mailbox and for the first time I was able to really see their full menu, and it was actually intriguing enough to decide to give it a try.  So on an unexpected Friday evening, after dropping my car off for inspection, we decided to give it a try...and I will thank whoever that guerilla marketer was.  It is very small, and totally unassuming. But the smoky aroma should be enough to draw in a passerby or two. They only have five or six tables, and by my tongue's estimation, this place should be full all the time, especially considering the other options currently available in the little hamlet of Bellevue. But for this late afternoon/early evening, we were the only two diners on site. And after having our meal, we found that just a little disappointing.   We scoped out the handwritten menu at the counter, and decided on sandwiches for the evening. I ordered the brisket Reuben (I've got to try everyone's Reuben at least once...I keep hoping to find that perfect New York Reuben in this burgh, and have yet to find it), and my better half ordered the Cuban. He ordered a side of asparagus, and I the slaw. We each grabbed a can of Coke product (thank goodness) and waited for the food. It took a little while, but this actually, in a place like this, tells me it's not being whipped out of a warmer pan, but is being made to order.  At first, for the price point, my eyes thought they were a little small when they arrived. A $10 Reuben and a $9 Cuban. However, upon biting into them, these 'little' sandwiches were VERY nicely stuffed, and with some pretty awesome flavor. I did not try a bite of the Cuban, so I can only go by my better half's opinion, which was that it was very good. But neither can he comment on my Reuben, because I didn't think to share a bite either.   As a NY Reuben, like all others in the burgh, it fails. BUT...this is not corned beef. It is a beautifully made beef brisket. However, I have to say, though I won't officially call it a 'Reuben', this was an absolutely delicious sandwich. When I chatted with the owner/chef, even he said he'd not had a real good Reuben since NY.   But if you're looking for a good facsimile with a twist, this would be the best one I've had in da burgh to date. And again, what looked 'small' was totally fulfilling. The slaw was unusual, but in a rather good way. It was not a knock off of every other slaw, but instead was unique. We couldn't pinpoint exactly what made up the sauce. It was creamy, a little mayo-ish, a tad dijon-ish, nice chunky cabbage...a tasty mystery. I'd choose it again as a side, absolutely.  After living in Miami, I was more than familiar with the 'Cuban', but didn't taste this one. However, in coordination with the 'small but stuffed' comment I made earlier, my better half commented on how 'stuffed' his was. It certainly looked good, and I might try it next time.  They have many other options to choose from, from racks of ribs, chicken, brisket, wings, and a variety of sauces and sides. Halushki, fries, asparagus. That's rather eclectic in itself. And the smokey aroma that fills the air on the small place really does entice.  I chatted a bit with the young chef (owner?), and asked about delivery and such, and I'm really looking forward to maybe ordering a pan of wings for delivery. I asked if I could try a couple of the sauces, and he was very kind to oblige. The 'Jorge' (which was highlighted with 'HOT'), had a pretty amazing tongue full of flavors going on. As one who loves TRUE 'hot'...though it had a small kick, it wasn't especially 'hot'...but the flavors that came out of one little taste were pretty amazing...my tongue first detected something slightly chocolatey, and the guy said it was actually hazelnut (a little Nutella action?). Then I tried the Garlic Chipotle, and was sold...this would be an awesome wing sauce. Next time I'm in a budget position, and lazy enough to not cook, wings with the garlic chipotle it will be! He told us that Wednesdays were their special 'wing night'. ...so maybe.  All in all...a very pleasant and delicious choice for the evening. I truly hope they get more business than they had while we were there. They certainly deserve it.   I know that Bellevue is hardly a 'destination' for diners, but this place, regardless of the other low rated reviews, just might be worth traveling to check out. These sandwiches were really damned good. The owner was very nice. The atmosphere was comfortable enough. I think there was a TV on, and gratefully, it wasn't blaring news or sports.   For a rare occasion...I actually tried a new place...and can say...'GO'!"}
{"text":"After hearing abut this place for a few months, I finally stopped by for lunch today. I got a pulled pork sandwich with sweet sauce, coleslaw, and Mac and cheese. Everything was hot and fresh, but the flavors were a bit blah. A lot of my pulled pork was burnt and inedible. Coleslaw was cut extra thick, which I personally didn't like. Staff was friendly! I'll likely give them another shot someday."}
{"text":"I ordered food at 10:37am, to be delivered at 3:45, as we had guests coming over. I was emailed around1:30 and informed that the order was canceled. No call, no explanation. I won't order from them again."}
