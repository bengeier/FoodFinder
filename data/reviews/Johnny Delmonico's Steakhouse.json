{"text":"We had our wedding reception, a dinner for 10 people, in the private dining room. The ambiance was warm and intimate for our group. The staff made the evening special by allowing us to pre-order appetizers and champagne that were ready and on the table when we arrived. Each of us ordered from the main menu and everyone was pleased with their dinners. The staff, especially our head waitress, Cynthia, were professional and attentive without being intrusive. What a wonderful evening to celebrate our marriage!"}
{"text":"I had not been here in quite awhile,  but i saw the happy hour deals and my wife and I decided to give it a try.  On the good side,  service was great,  the calamari appetizer was excellent and we enjoyed the discounted wine.  On the minus side,  my wife ordered her steak medium rare and emphasized the rare part and still received a mefium to medium well steak.  Very disappointing for a steak place.   I took a chance and had the thai pizza.  It had some nice flavors but was bone dry.  Just some tangy sauce would have made it.  So, disappointing for us.  I truly expected better."}
{"text":"I celebrated an anniversary recently at Johnny Delmonico's. We made a reservation on a Tuesday. Then, after some discussion, we showed up an hour early. They were very accommodating, but to be honest, we were the only ones in the restaurant anyway.  Our waitress came over right away and wished us a happy anniversary (which my date had mentioned on the phone) and made cocktail recommendations. (Maraschino Sidecar and Old Fashioned, both decent) She also brought us warm, fresh bread, which was welcome on this particularly cold night.  We placed our order with the waitress, who somehow talked us in to a few items that we didn't need, but she had mentioned them so casually, it made them sound like they were included, or just a slight up charge. (I should say that being pretty young still, we are generally pretty modest about money, but this was a really special occasion meal, so we splurged. And to be fair, we didn't ask directly how much they would cost. Still, we ended up spending more than we anticipated.)   The side Cesar salad I ended up ordering with my steak was $7, and was pretty lackluster to be honest. You can get a cheaper, larger, and far more flavorful Cesar at Ian's Pizza! My date also said yes to sautéed mushrooms on his steak which was another $7! Sautéed mushrooms and/or onions should not cost that much... Come on.  Anyway, we ordered a side of Mac and cheese, which was good enough, but the flavor sort of disappeared as I was eating my steak.  The steaks! They were phenomenal! I ordered the petite sirloin, blackened. The blackening seasoning was sooooooo good. Nicely crusted, without being too overbearing. And for the potato, I chose a crispy golden frisbee of house made hash-browns. Oh my gosh, it was amazing!  My date had the ribeye and garlic mashed potatoes. He always cleans his plate, but he ended up taking half of the meal home because of the size of it. He said it was cooked to his liking (medium rare). The garlic mashed potatoes were super smooth and tasty.  Overall, JD's could step up their game in certain areas, but where it counted (service, atmosphere, steaks) they hit the nail on the head. I can see going back for another special occasion, but being more aware of cost will certainly serve my wallet on our next visit."}
{"text":"Went for a private dinner, quite yummy. Nothing out of the ordinary but everything was solid, fairly traditional. Fried calamari with spicy peanut glaze was an unusual standout. Steaks cooked flawlessy, truffle skinny fries tasty, if not perhaps a touch too skinny. mac and cheese also delicious, but this seems par for the course in Madison. The only disappointment was the bordelaise sauce that was more just salty than flavorful, but then again most places don't make a stellar bordelaise.  Top notch service, staff were great. Great for a business dinner or when you want solid traditional food."}
{"text":"Arriving at this restaurant, my boyfriend and I thought that we were going to be in for a real treat.  The customer service was fabulous and it had a very classy style, just the type of place you would want to order gourmet, delicious food at.  Granted, we knew the prices were expensive, but we figured we would be paying for what we got.  The unfortunate thing about restaurants is regardless of the customer service and decor, the food is the point of going there.  If you are not going to get a steak (that ranges from $30-$50), this is not the place for you.  We ordered the strangest Asian calamari, let me tell you calamari was NEVER meant to be Asian.  Then, the \"soup of the day\" consisted of the strangest smell and taste--bad Mexican rice.    The menu is pretty disappointing and it seems that they do not understand what flavors go well together.  I even saw a seared Ahi Tuna dish topped with red chili peppers...talk about weird. The only reason I would give it two stars is because the service was IMPECCABLE.  Also, the ambience was very nice, perfect lighting and perfect decorations."}
{"text":"Scallops were perfectly prepared.  Steak on the brochette was slightly chewy, good flavor."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  Love the salmon and I haven't had a bad app here yet.  A great place to unwind and enjoy great food and drink."}
{"text":"After a bad experience at Mader's in Milwaukee, Delmonicos was a pleasant treat.  Not cheap but you get what you pay for.  Great manager and wait staff.  Filet was wonderful and my wife's Taste of Delmonico's was perfect.  Great job."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars because both dining experiences were fantastic! Incredible as that seems.. Service was actually the best I've received anywhere during our first visit - my birthday with 5 family members ages 23 - 85. Waitress was knowledgable, consistently professional (despite our silliness), most accommodating (swapping wines for my indecisive mother etc.), not hovering but ALWAYS there when needed.  Food did not disappoint anyone - seafood and steaks, soups and salads, and sporadic dessert (usually we're just-right full).  I will keep this restaurant on my GoTo list for \"special - comfortably elegant - spoiling\" nights out!"}
{"text":"Great dry aged NY strip with the perfect amount of seasoning. The bartender made some nice wine recommendations and provided fantastic service. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go for occasions downtown. Awesome service and they have a really cool drink menu! We usually stick with the filets and they have never disappointed. The Brussels sprout au gratin was surprisingly delicious. They also offer really great price fix menus on special occasions, we went on Valentine's Day and felt it was a good deal."}
{"text":"OK, every so often a restaurant just pisses me off. Welcome to Johnny Delmonico's. Where they don't know how to make a pepper steak, despite billing themselves as a steakhouse. Where the bartender can't make an old fashioned even after its been sent back twice, and despite old fashioneds being the national drink of Wisconsin.  This place is all tablecloths and pretense and hefty bills. Skip it. Seriously."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants. We've been here a few times and i was always a huge fan of their creamy mac n cheese.However, we went again just a few days ago after maybe a year of not going. The experience was extremely disappointing. My steak, which i had ordered medium rare was barely pink and kind of burned. I had a caesar salad which was different but it lacked in flavor. And most importantly the mac and cheese that I had been anticipating for forever was disgusting. It was dry, the shells were different and it didn't taste like anything. The mac and cheese was the only reason i liked this place, now I have absolutely no reason to go back. I can get a better steak anywhere else for a better price."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. The French onion soup was fantastic definitely a recommend. The steaks were done just write and the wait staff was great"}
{"text":"had our 31st wedding anniversary dinner there on Dec 21st, i had the tenderloin oscar style with brussel sprouts, it was unbelievable good you barely needed a knife to cut it, my husband had the dry age ribeye with hashbrowns cooked perfectly  our waiter was superb and polite, this is the perfect place for that special night out and would totally recomended it thank you for making that night special"}
{"text":"I've been to Delmonico's a few times for steaks, which are always solid. However, this place is also a good choice for a burger at the bar. Quality beef, big & juicy, cooked just right. I subbed blue cheese instead of the aged cheddar, and somehow they browned....(broiled?) the cheese to get a golden  crust, which was perfect. Also, homemade pickles & aioli. Fries were plump & crisp. Finished with what appeared to be a house-made cheesecake, clearly made with skill, and tasted great."}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate my anniversary since my partner a serious steak lover but wish we would had gone somewhere else. The ambiance is nice, dimly lit. The food quality was not worth the price. The crab cake appetizer was the best thing we had, super moist and full of flavor. I got the halibut because I don't eat red meat and my partner had a new york strip steak. We agreed both plates were bland, nothing special. The service was good even though they couldn't find our reservation I had made two days prior. If you go here you're paying for the experience and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Party of 5, on a Saturday.  No problem getting a table or changing the reservation.  Bartender was great.  Nice wine selection. Perfectly mixed drinks.  We were seated quickly.  Our waiter, Kerry, made our night.  He is a true professional.  His extra touches were noticed and appreciated. Calamari was ok - too sweet for my taste. He more than made up for the 4 of 5 steakes that were slightly over cooked and over seasoned. The mashed potatoes were average and the asparagus was overcooked.  However, the brussel sprouts were great.  We'd come back for Kerry.  Not so much for the food."}
{"text":"While the staff is very polite and attentive, the food is mediocre and over priced.  I would not reccomend this to anyone for any occasion."}
{"text":"One thing to definitely keep in mind is that there will be a good deal of food coming your way if you eat here.  They were very accommodating to a large party even as the numbers kept on changing both up and down. This is the third time I've eaten here and every time, the servers were polite, professional and courteous, not to mention knowledgeable about the menu.  For appetizers, we went seafood, selecting the scallops, shrimp cocktail and, by far my favorite, the calamari. It was well cooked, crisp and the sweet chili sauce complemented it beautifully! If I had to skip one thing, it would be the shrimp cocktail. As good as it was, it wasn't worth the price. The french onion soup was very good, I only wish it had more of that wonderfully melty cheese; I only got through half of the soup before I was out of that cheesy goodness.  You're at a steakhouse, so get a steak. To be perfectly honest, the 16 oz ribeye is more than anyone should eat in a given sitting but it's so good. Mine was perfectly mid-rare but one of my dining companions had her steak a bit too rare for her liking. A side of crispy hash browns, a full skillet's worth, pairs wonderfully with it, that is a meal in and of itself."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal last Friday evening. I sat at the Bar and chatted with the bartender who was both friendly and accommodating. I had the NY strip which was cooked perfectly along with fries and the vegetable special of the day-Chinese broccoli. All items were modified if necessary to be gluten free per my request. The price was pleasantly reasonable for a higher end steakhouse and seemed like a steal for the quality and experience. I will definitely be returning on my next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"Unfortunately Johnny D's has gone downhill. I have been going to this restaurant for the past four years and it has always been one of my favorites. However, I went there last Friday and it has gone completely downhill. Our dining experience was so bad that I will not be returning to eat there nor recommending it to other people. It's really a shame considering we had been loyal customers for years. Last Friday we ordered two filet mignons. One done medium well and one done medium. They came medium rare and rare. We weren't given and steak knives and we waited and waited to get our waitresses attention but she was nowhere to be found. Finally we asked the hostess if she could find her for us. The one steak came with a side of garlic, the other did not even though both dishes were the same thing. One steak came blue cheese crusted the other didn't, even though both were ordered with blue cheese. The garlic mashed potatoes were watery. We ordered a side of cream corn 'gratin'. What a disappointment. It tasted terrible and had no resemblance to a gratin whatsoever. Our waitress never stopped by our table to ask us how our food was. When I finally got her attention I told her we were disappointed in the corn gratin. She could have cared less. What a lousy way to celebrate a birthday dinner. Like I said we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I had this gosh-awful grilled chicken sandwich with limp greens and a gooey fried egg between focaccia for lunch here--don't remember how it was billed but this is all I can remember: Ack. It also reminded me of what we called an equally awful \"bad breath sandwich\" at a \"gourmet\" cafeteria next to a museum where I once worked. Anyway, friend had a grilled shrimp curry salad -- being a curry fan she said she couldn't taste any curry!   While the place is beautiful and I imagine some power lunches with lobbyists and legislators go on here, go elsewhere for lunch. Maybe it's a go here for dinner, based on the other reviews."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times, and have found the experience to be consistently positive and satisfying. Our four-tip split an app of bacon-wrapped scallops (five of them, oddly) which were done expertly. Two split wedge salads later (they were fine), four steaks all passed the test - even for the price. Sides were adequate - high marks for the fries, decent score for the hash browns, but the garlic mashed potatoes were sadly only average. Dessert of coffee and creme brulee capped it all off.  Ambiance was decent - there's only one non-bar area where windows are present - three four-tops and a couple two-tops. It can get cramped, but the noise level was appropriate for the proximity to our neighbors. Service has always shined in all our visits there, and this visit was no exception.  You'll probably get sticker shock if you hit the drinks as well as dinner (we had a round of Delmonico Old Fashioneds and a bottle of wine with dinner), but it's not like that's a surprise."}
{"text":"A fantastic and elegant establishment in the heart of madison.  The wine selections were varied and priced so that you can find something for every budget.  The cocktails were mixed to perfection.  The service was tremendous and accommodating.  My last visit to this location was a first date which was going very well.  The waitress was on top of her game, as she was attentive, and anticipated our every want.  Yet at the same time, she always waited for a break in the conversation to attend to us.  I highly recommend Johnny Delmonicos.  Every visit has been a time to remember."}
{"text":"Best fine dining steak house in Madison."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have great steak, great service, and a pretty nice wine list! Used to come here for often until we moved out of the city. Their staff is very friendly and it definitely helps having a reservation. They have some competition with Rare steakhouse!! Anyway, I would recommend coming here for a nice and romantic evening with your lover or even a nice evening with some of your loved ones. I'm sure they will not disappoint! There is nearby parking in the ramp across the street which is very convenient. They have a pretty nice bar here as well. Depending on who your waiter/waitress is you'll either have the best service ever of you'll end up having not so good service. Sometimes the waitstaff isn't really knowledgeable on the wines but will ask the bartender for advice. Depending on who you have as a waiter or waitress will serve an impact on your dining experience. Some are really attentive and friendly and some are not. But hey, I'm there to eat and not make friends. Having friendly staff is just a plus."}
{"text":"I've visited Johnny Delmonicos many times in the past couple of years. I'ved watched their menu evolve to what is today and always note improvement.  No, its not a primehouse like Rare, but they serve a solid Angus beef steak.   In the past years, the steaks have always been spot on.  Additions have been made like the bone-in tenderloin. While other places on the square do offer dry aged beef (somewhere around a 30 day dry age), I have noticed that Johnnys dry age steak has a lot more of the characteristic flavor (who also claims about a 30 day dry age).  Whenever I goto Johnnys with my girlfriend, she will get a non-beef option. This is probably where I have noticed the most improvement. So many great fish, chicken, pork, and lamb options that are perfectly cooked and uniquely spiced. These options have changed over time and continue to improve.  The sides are simple. A variety of potatoes and vegetable options. Cooked perfectly and given what is expected every time.  Service is always stellar. We always get the same waitress because she always does a outstanding job taking care of us."}
{"text":"Great downtown Madison restaurant. Although not a red meat eater, I know the crowd I was with really enjoyed their variety of rib-eye, and porter house steaks. Cynthia, our waitress, was superb. Always attentive. My salad was on the menu as a steak salad however Cynthia augmented with the most tender chicken. Nice flexibility. Prices in line with a good steakhouse. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hmm . . . .it's 8:00pm on a  Monday night and I find myself in Madison, WI -hungry, tired and looking for a place that is close by to my hotel to grab some dinner.  I am pointed toward Johnny's and low and behold- my entire evening turns around.  Great corner window seat to watch the happenings in downtown Madison? Check.  Very dirty martini served quickly WITH blue cheese olives?  Check.  A menu with alot of choices beyond steak AND fresh oysters?  Check.   Okay.  A few days in Madison is starting to look up.  We scoured the menu and finally decided on non beef entrees (daring in a steakhouse and that is pretty much what Johnny's is)- scallops for a colleague and seared ahi tuna for me. Delicious! Both come with this amazing salad with pine nuts, goat cheese and greens tossed with balsamic vinegar.  Terrific!  We stuck to mixed drinks but the wine list was also intriguing.  Other than a server that disappeared for lengths at a time and had to be hunted down- and a cracked martini glass (didn't want to waste a drop) this was a pretty good evening.  Dinner for two with drinks and dessert was about $100 which was cheap given the amount of food we had.  So the next time you see me and I am still going on and on about Johnny-no- I didn't meet a new man. Just a new place that will definitely go on my list to visit the next time I am in Madison."}
{"text":"I found Johnny Delmonicos to be a very positive experience. I went here for my birthday dinner yesterday. While I ate on the lighter side, by the end of my meal I was stuffed. Our waiter was very helpful in wine selections and overall a delightful person. To start, I ordered the Baked French Onion soup and I was actually a little surprised as I thought it wasn't that good. It was very thyme-y. I also ordered the mixed greens salad and it had a nice rich favor from the topped goat cheese. For my entree I ordered the scallops. The scallops were accompanied by pancetta, Fingerling potatoes and sweet aioli. They were very delicate and cooked perfectly. Although Johnny D's is known for their steak. I had a bite of the filet and it practically melted in my mouth. This place is a great choice for a date night or other special occasions."}
{"text":"Restaurant week at Johnny's was a nice dinner. In addition to the three course meal, we ordered a shrimp cocktail. This was the only disappointment of our meal, everything else was very good. That being said, i am not sure what the deal was...the shrimp just didn't taste the best/freshest for $22 (5 shrimp) and the cocktail sauce was a little bland.   My boyfriend and I shared a bottle of red wine they had on special for $40. I would say their drink menu has much variety and competitive (fair) pricing for downtown Madison.  Course 1: We both enjoyed the Caprese salad as an appetizer. I would recommend that. The mozzarella was fantastic.   Course 2: The NY strip and mashed potatoes were amazing! The steaks seemed to be cut in half for the restaurant week promotion, but still over 5 oz. Flavors were great.   Course 3: I had the chocolate torte - loved that! My boyfriend had the Creme Brulee. He also enjoyed. I would say Johnny Delmonico's dessert game is on point!   Overall, i would say i will be back...but probably not until i shuffle through the other upscale dining options in Madison. It was not a show stopping meal, but i would speak highly of this restaurant."}
{"text":"We went to Johnny Delmonico's for Restaurant Week and the food was quite lovely. The decor is cozy and our server was helpful but not intrusive, but actually could have been a bit more \"available\" at times. One of the people in our party has a dairy allergy and they were able to accommodate her without too much trouble and even had a dairy-free dessert option that was much appreciated. I had a mushroom appetizer, a beef entree and a bourbon pecan dessert. I wasn't blown away by any of them, but I'd happily eat them again. Athough the portions were on the smaller side, they were adequate/appropriate for the $25 price tag. All in all, one of the better Restaurant Week meals we've had in the past few years."}
{"text":"Everything blended in wonderfully with the mushrooms and the mash potato. We also had fries on the side that I did not care too much for. They were overly salty and a bit mushy. The Wisconsin's mac n cheese was pretty good. Service is a B."}
{"text":"Despite a scathing review a few weeks ago we decided to keep the reservation we had made for New Years Eve. Then a couple of days ago we were pleased to learn a new chef had been brought in from another restaurant.I wish I could say this was a great meal but it was not. The ambiance and the decor was lovely. Our server was a true professional. When we brought concerns to his  attention he immediately tried to make things right. Some highlights... The wedge salad, the chicken entree, my French Gimlet and the lobster bisque. The just okay....the steaks, the broccoli, the pie, the creme brulee and the bread. The bad...the garlic mashed potatoes which were touted by the waiter. They were dry, tasteless and cold. The hashbrowns were also cold. It should be noted that the potatoes were targeted in the bad review. The chocolate cake was unremarkable. The manager was open to feedback which was a good sign. I do love the location and the decor. I so hope the necessary changes area made. Food Fight must step up their game. They know how to make a restaurant pleasing to the eye and now they have to deliver to the palette. I know I am not only person that misses Firefly. I rue the day Texas Tubbs moved in. Eating out has become a luxury. Mediocrity is not acceptable.  Here's to a delicious New Year!"}
{"text":"I took my wife on a date night this past Friday and after much debate we finally landed on Johnny Delmonico's for our dinner location.  I had been before many years ago and was not too impressed but I was willing to try it again.  We arrived early and the atmosphere is what I expected and practically we were the only people in the restaurant (not a bad thing, we arrive at 5:00 when they opened).  We were seated immediately and welcomed by a very wonderful and pleasant wait staff.  I will give them very high remarks on service!  One of my favorite things in the world is bacon wrapped scallops and their appetizer did not disappoint.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and were absolutely delicious.   I only wish I had more of them.  However the main course was not so entertaining for me.  Both my wife and I ordered the surf & turf (pre-planned as it was what we were craving).  My wifes steak (6oz petite tenderloin) was ordered medium-well and was cooked that way but was charred on the outside a little too much.  Her lobster was cooked well.  Her garlic mashed potatoes were delicious but small in portion.  My steak (8oz tenderloin) was ordered medium and  was served medium well much to my displeasure and to me the steak lacked in flavor.  My lobster was undercooked and also lacked in flavor that a lobster should have. I would have liked a larger lobster tail over the whole lobster that was also small in size).  My double baked potato was wonderful. In addition the drawn butter for our lobsters was bland, served cool, and very disappointing.  Overall it was a good dining experience but, besides the scallop appetizer, lacked in flavor.  I was hoping for an amazing dining experience that would bring me back to Delmonico's on a more frequent basis but that is not the case."}
{"text":"We treated our neighbors to dinner here, expecting a killer steak experience. Unfortunately, our steaks were all over-cooked. We would have sent them back, however we were made to wait 45 minutes past our reservation, and it took 30 minutes before we could place our dinner order.  PRO: Super nice hostess/host/waiter. CON: Long wait, overcooked steak"}
{"text":"Calamari appetizer with a sweet and spicy sauce is a big deal for me. .. anytime I see it on a menu I order it.  This one came with peanuts and apparently you can't get it without the nuts ( sad face for those with allergies). I thought the Calamari was pretty good. ..personally I would have liked more sauce,  but it had a pretty good flavor and the nuts weren't to overbearing. Not the best I've ever had but not bad.   Ordered the Java crusted ribeye with a baked potato. The timing between my app and dinner entree was a little longer than it should have been.   My waiter warned me that the Java may be to much but I actually thought it was pretty subtle. ..I do like coffee flavored food though. The presentation of the baked potato was nice but it was a little underwhelming. ..no salted skin or anything ( yes, I eat the skin. ..lol). That's not a major problem but I added some pepper to give it a little something something.   I usually eat my steak medium well but the other reviews made me order it medium. I thought it was pretty spot on. The 16 oz was way to big for me to eat in 1 sitting but overall not bad. I would come back again. ... Just not rush back."}
{"text":"At first I was amazed by the decor and the extremely professional service at Johnny Delmonico's. When my plates were dropped in front of me, I gaped in awe. This is an extremely nice place. But the quality of the food didn't totally come through. once I had finished my meal, I was just thinking, meh.  Now, if you have a lot of money to spend, this place really is good to get a meal at. I just don't know if I would pick it over another fancy downtown steakhouse. The french onion soup I started with was excellent - the layer of fresh, perfectly melted Wisconsin cheese on top is really what did it. These guys also know the meaning of \"medium rare,\" unlike many Madison restaurants.   However, I should have just gotten the tenderloin by itself, rather than ordering it as part of a \"special.\" It was surrounded by a very creative group of ingredients, including caramelized red onions, sweet potato straws, grilled baby tomatoes, and an avocado aioli. Sounded great in theory, and it looked beautiful, but together all the ingredients just made an indistinguishable mash of vegetables. Nothing was especially fresh or well-prepared, except for the steak itself. I cut through a thick filet mignon like it was butter, and found a core containing a perfect shade of pink.  My mouth waters just thinking about the cut of tenderloin I got at Johnny Delmonico's. If you come here, spare yourself the expense of an overdone meal and just get what they're good at - a thick, juicy piece of steak."}
{"text":"8/24/13  This review and rating is about the bar and NOT their kitchen.  My wife and I stopped at Johnny Delmonico's to start our anniversary celebration.  We really enjoy their bar services. Stop in for a drink.  The space is great.  The bartenders know their stuff and are friendly.  I'm NOT a fan of their kitchen output and would not suggest dining there.  I haven't enjoyed their food on any occasion.  SORRY.   I do understand they have a new GM.  Perhaps things have changed at the BOH, but once bitten twice shy."}
{"text":"Man was I full after I ate at Johnny's. It was my first trip to this steakhouse, and I'd have to say it holds its own compared to the competition in the area.   I got that 10oz, NY Strip, Oscar style. That's right, I wasn't afraid to roll the dice and give it the oscar treatment. To quote the great Yngwie Malmsteen \"people always tell me that less is more.....how is this possible? More is More.\"   I also got the hashbrowns as my potato, and they were great.   The only reason this place didn't get 5/5 from me is because I ordered a sidecar, and it came in a martini glass. I mean I'm no expert, but it seems like a rocks glass would've been more appropriate. Maybe I'm being too critical, maybe I've been watching too much Mad Men lately, but it just rubbed me the wrong way."}
{"text":"We managed to snag reservations for an early New Year's Eve dinner.  This was our first visit and we'll be back!  The service was excellent and the food was delicious.  I ordered the lobster bisque as my starter, it was creamy and flavorful with just the right amount of lobster meat.   My husband had the Caesar salad and commented that it was a little heavy on the anchovy.  For our entrées, I ordered the filet with a side of scallops and hash browns, and my husband had the ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes, and we split a side of sautéed wild mushrooms.  Both our steaks were cooked perfectly and the mushrooms were an excellent complement (as were the scallops!). My serving of hash browns was huge but I finished it because they were so delicious...the perfect combination of crispy, buttery, and tender.  Yum!  I had the flourless chocolate torte for dessert and enjoyed it although it was very dense and rich.  Next time I'd follow my husband's lead and get the cheesecake...he let me have a bite and it was very good!  Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Typical MEDIOCRE Food Fight experience.  Great atmosphere, but the food is not of the quality one would expect from a restaurant that charges $$$ for a meal. Had the blue crab cake and the calamari to start, house salad and a ceaser salad--nothing remarkable about any of it.  Ran out of the halibut before 7pm on  a Tuesday so ended up eating the Ahi Tuna, nothing notable about except it for the shredded vegetables on top were difficult to eat. Petite tenderloin was cooked inconsistently. Should have been  med rare was cooked hard in some spots and fine in others.   Enormous baked potato was luke warm, and vegetables okay. Desert selection and drinks were fine. But the bottom line is there was nothing notable about the whole dinner.  If I am going to eat a meal like that I don't want to be left with a mediocre experience.  I really wonder if Food Fight management ever reads the reviews on there restaurants. I have eaten at many of them  including Ocean Grill, Monty's, Bluephies, Texas Tubs, Eldorado Grill, Market St. Diner, Fresco's and all are great atmosphere BUT very very mediocre food quality.   The exception is Cooper's Tavern. Food Fight restaurants remind  me of the movie \"Demolition Man\", when Sylvester Stallone and Sandra Bullock discuss in the post apocalyptic future, only one fast food chain has survived the \"fast food wars\": Taco Bell.  In other words it's all the same food. MEDICORE!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 1/2 portion of calamari (with the newsletter subscribers special) and the ribeye steak. The meal comes with warm bread.   Calamari was delicious! The bread was great too.   The steak with hash browns was cooked to perfection.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"On a recent business trip to Madison, I had the opportunity to experience Demonico's.  As it's a rare occasion to hit a nice steak joint, I was definitely excited and eager to get in the door and sample the menu.  We ended up ordering almost every app and a variety of sides, in addition to my main course - the Tenderloin (ordered medium-rare - of course!).    While the ambiance is typical higher-end steak place, i.e. dark, formal, and warm (by the way, this is all good) and the server was great, the food certainly fell short of all my expectations.  The mussels were in a sauce that felt too watered down, the tuna app was average, as were most of the sides.  My steak was over cooked and dry.  Johhny Delmonico's has all the makings of a great restaurant, but it maybe time to look for a better kitchen staff."}
{"text":"Great appitizer, bloody Mary and excellent seafood."}
{"text":"I love Johnny Delmonico's!  In the dozens of times that I have been there for lunch or dinner, I have never once received anything less than stellar service and an outstanding meal."}
{"text":"Dee. Lish. Us!   I'm in Madison for work, and have been working hard - so naturally I wanted to treat myself to a nice dinner and wine.   The place was pretty empty, but what do I care....   Just better service for ME.   I sat at the bar, and Carmen (the tender) was very friendly and helpful.  I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat or drink and she suggested a couple of things.     I ended up going with a bottle of Shiraz (bc that's my favorite) and although it was a brand I've never heard of Two Hands, but it too was a great bottle of wine.    Now the 8oz filet I ordered was grilled to perfection, and the garlic mashed potatoes were an excellent compliment.   Highly recommended for a special treat."}
{"text":"Update to my earlier review:  The GM of JDs reached out to me to try to rectify the poor experience with a gift card. Totally unexpected! However, it is great to know that this restaurant cares about their customer's experiences and realized that word of mouth is a powerful tool. Bravo! We'll give this restaurant another shot... :)"}
{"text":"Went to Johnny D's for a business dinner.  Saw mixed reviews from previous customers.  However, my visit was great.  The customer service was okay.  But, the food was excellent.  Calamari and bacon wrapped scallops with wedge salad were great for starters.  My main entree was the 16oz ribeye with a baked potato.  I have always said the best steak I ever have is the one I grill myself.  This chef proved me wrong.  I am here for the food, so no deduct for the mediocre service.  After the steak, there was no room for desert."}
{"text":"Took the wife for an early Valentines Day dinner on Saturday.   The knowledge of the staff on drinks, especially scotch whiskey, was amazing. Selection was just as amazing.  Had an old fashioned made with a 10yr Talisker. Best ever.  When I go to steak houses, I order roughly the same thing each time, as a fun way to compare joint to joint.  Steakhouse salad (iceberg wedge)was crisp, cold, and the Bleu had good flavor.  16 ounce ribeye, cooked medium well, with the Java crust. (Coffee rub, that doesn't add coffee flavor, but breaks down the proteins with the acidity of the espresso). Brussels Sprouts and mushrooms for a side, and hash browns as choice of potato. Brussels were crazy good, chopped up with exotic cheeses, mushrooms were a standard blend of shitaki, button, etc., and very good, hash browns were the best I've ever had, anywhere, breakfast lunch, or dinner.   The steak.  Ordered medium well, came over cooked, grey, and had to saw through with my knife.  Was utterly shocked. I mentioned to our waiter (Jamie), and a new one was cooked immediately.  The manager came and spoke with us, and thanked us for letting them fix it. Great service.  The second steak came out and it was wonderful.  Mistakes happen no matter who the chef is.  Might I suggest of ordering the Java crust, order one heat range below your normal.  I'm a medium-well person, and it ended up being well, with the java.  We didn't have dessert, were to full from the dinner and drinks.  Wife had the same thing, minus the java, and garlic mashed instead of browns.  Hers was perfect.  She enjoyed a lemon type martini, I had what was called the Manhattan Project (Awwwwesome!)  Bill came to $170, which put it in the mid to lower ballpark of steak places we've  been to, price-wise.   I'd rank the sides and drinks here top 2 of the places we've been.  The steak, probably 6th or 7th on the list below.  Flemings  Smith and Wollensky's  Joe's steak and crab David Burke's Del Frisco's  Ruth's Chris Phil Stefani's  Wonder Bar Johnnie's Italian And local houses   Very classy place, a definite score for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Good steakhouse with great sides. I prefer the Ribeye and that's all I've had..  Mashed potatoes and asparagus are very good and nice wine selection... weekends Better make a reservation."}
{"text":"Johnny Delmonico's is a classy establishment just off the Capitol square. Their interior reminds me of when Sean Connery and Harrison Ford were on the zeppelin in the movie, \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\". I would describe it as streamlined, intimate, and modern in the sense of Art Deco. The booths I saw were private and warm and the sound levels very quiet.  Supper was superb. I sat at the bar and began with a Silver Gimlet, which was a mixed masterfully at the bar. Gin, simple syrup, lime juice, and the right touch of mint. Excellent.  Oysters Delmonico followed as an appetizer. What a great choice. A very rich presentation of 6 oysters topped with finely cut spinach, finely diced smoked bacon, hollandaise and breadcrumbs, then toasted until broiled. The center of the plate holds one-half a lemon wrapped in cheesecloth. They were very good and I would certainly get them again. While they were a touch heavy on the hollandaise, I thought they had the perfect amount of bacon. So often you get a, \"more is better\" philosophy with bacon but here the chef knows that is not true. I would certainly order these again, and feel a man could do quite well to just order 3 of these and call it a bachelor's dinner. Word of advice to the diner: use the lemon. I didn't on my first two and I regret it, as the oysters went from good to great with the addition of the lemon.  The main was a 10 ounce New York Strip seared right in between medium and medium-rare, precisely what I requested. Great job back in the kitchen. It was lightly seasoned and plenty juicy despite a being very lean. When I asked about the potato options for an accompaniment and what the best choice was, the bartender James told me that the french fries were shoestring fries and drizzled with white truffle oil. They were cooked nicely and they did not short anyone on the drizzling...the fries were richly earthy; in fact, too much so for me! However, if you're a lover of truffles go with them. You won't be sorry.  Service was pleasant, competent and attentive, but fairly insincere. I've experienced this with Food Fight's restaurants, but never with Lettuce Entertain You operations in Chicago. Something for management to think about. Still, I'll take attentive and insincere over the other way around any day of the week.  Finally, there were two other things about the menu I wanted to compliment. First, the steaks are a wide variety of weights and cuts. I've never seen a 10 ounce strip on a menu before but it was wonderful to see it and allowed me to order a generous appetizer for myself. Also, their dessert menu was original, exciting, and wide-ranging. It had a bit of everything, and when I see that level of creativity in what is normally a realm of same-old, same-old options, I'm excited. I'll sample the next time I am there.  Go for for it - I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal, and there is a wide range of fish and fowl options if steak isn't your thing."}
{"text":"While I enjoyed my visit to Johnny Delmonico's, I can't give this restaurant anything beyond three stars because the food just wasn't that great. Our server was very pleasant and attentive, and we liked the classy/cozy atmosphere. Cocktails were tasty. Food, not so much.  -- Calamari app (recommended by server): Quite tasty with a different flavor than expected since it was sweet/spicy with an Asian vibe. But the texture was not good -- it was quite rubbery and overcooked.   -- Tuna au poivre dish: Maybe I made the mistake of ordering something non-steak at a steakhouse, but the tuna and cauliflower were the only edible items on my plate. The au poivre sauce was so over-peppered that my lips felt like they were burning because the sauce was pepper overload.  -- Creme brulee for dessert: Bland (not sweet at all) and over-torched. I don't want to eat creme brulee that's crunchy and burnt-tasting. Do you know how sad that is?  All in all, I enjoyed my time dining at Johnny Delmonico's, but I don't feel that I really got what I paid for, and I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"Went for our 25th wedding anniversary. Service was friendly but bad. The food came out cold. The scallops were cold and under cooked. The steak was done well instead of medium rare. I would not complain on this particular night however afterwards my wife told me hers was cold also."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here - only one so far - but it was so good it's worth sharing.   Truly nice environment. Comfortable, large tables. Nice linens and exceptional lighting. Food servers who are knowledgeable, professional and have an eye on detail. Exceptional food and execution. A wine list that goes beyond competence and delivers some challenges.   For me, the attention to details here are what makes dining at Delmonico's a rewarding experience.   To start, cocktails are well made - shaken to the appropriate stage - and not meager. Appetizers (I stayed in the seafood realm) were wonderful. Warm scallops, perfectly tender, wrapped in a thin round of crispy bacon. Crab cakes - though not of the Maryland substance - still delicious and married with a lovely mustard aioli.   Known for steaks, there are some rather standard choices that joyously expand in nightly specials to include bone-in options and a Porterhouse. Opt for the rib-eye. Excellent flavor. Juicy (meaning properly rested) and executed to temperature. Crispy skinned cod, moist without failing to cloying, mushroom saute and a (somewhat bland) carrot ginger puree. A bacon-infused mac and cheese that delivers on the cheese-creaminess so many others fall short of.   I dug the creme brulee - accomplished but not eye opening. The chocolate cake lacked something for me in the texture, but the cocoa flavor and the frosting all scored high.   Dining in a restaurant is more than just eating food. It's about service, it's about atmosphere, and - in the right hands - it's about inspiration. Delmonicos puts together a well rounded experience. Places like the Tornado club offer great to superior food - they should let their steaks rest longer - but the environment can be a bit too funky for a nice evening out, and the service can be a bit too junior varsity to really propel the overall experience into \"special\". No stumbles on that front here.   I will point out that the open room with high ceilings can get noisy fast, but it didn't detract from the experience for me. A pleasant \"event\" type memory of bigger city dining. Your mileage might vary."}
{"text":"Johnny Delmonico's fits the bill for a great steak or seafood dinner.  The vibe is classy, service is professional, and the food is dynamite.  My husband and I spent over two hours here and had wonderful service from both the bar and waitstaff.  I had a French Gimlet cocktail with dinner and I now have a favorite drink.  St. Germaine and Prosecco are the bomb.  For dinner, I had the 6 oz. tenderloin with a side of hashbrowns and my husband had the King Crab Leg.  Literally, it is just a single crab leg, but it is so monstrous he had enough to share with me. Delicious. My tenderloin was cooked a perfect medium rare and was right up there with a couple of the best steakhouses back home in Minneapolis.  I think our favorite part of the meal, however, was the side of warm creamy corn and potatoes.  Holy smokes, that stuff is addictive!  If Delmonico's had take-out, I would get that every time.  We skipped dessert but lingered for awhile over some port and brandy.  Our bill was under $150 for two people, which was reasonable for such a great night out.  Highly recommended for a special occasion, date night, or business dinner."}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated, simply because it's one of the only flashy-modern restaurant in town. It's the de facto nice place (read: prom) to eat in Madison. It's not horrible, but debatable if it's worth the price.  Their Martinis were pretty good - nice olives, but their old fashioneds were not good. Let's huddle on that one, guys.   I can't remember what apps we got, but they were decent. I was really not too impressed with their steaks; I found them to be soft and just meh. The scallops were delicious and had some great flavors - kudos for those. the desserts were forgettable and could be skipped without regret.  PS - this review is sponsored by Oliver :)"}
{"text":"Love the bar.  The bartender was awesome.  He really made our last stop for the night great! This was on 3/25/16."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed in Johnny Delmonico's steakous. The pumpkin soup was good, and our server was very attentive, but the tenderloin was far from the best one we have ever had.  We ordered the 8 oz tenderloins and were very disappointed in the lack of flavor and tenderness.  To make matters worse, we sent an e-mail to the manager, Craig Madigan and received no response, so we then sent a \"snail mail\" letter - again to no response.  Our son is a Freshman at UW and we will be visiting from Chicago very frequently.  However, we will make sure not to stop at Johnny Delmonicos again, but will be spreading the word about the poor management at this restaurant.   Also, it should be noted that this restaurant is not affiliated with the famous and delicious Delmonicos on Beaver Street, in the Wall Street are of Manhatten."}
{"text":"I went for a special occasion and it was a nice treat, we weren't disappointed.  The salad and soup was great, our steak was very good, and the dessert was good. Our server was attentive and helpful and we enjoyed how elegant and special the place made us feel.  Nevertheless, for the price that we paid, we should have been blown away by our food and that certainly didn't happen.  While we weren't disappointed, there are many other restaurants where I could get a much better steak for a lot less money- choose Tornado, Eldorado Grill, or Lombardinos instead."}
{"text":"Delmonico's in my mind is the best restaurant in Madison for those looking for a perfect meal in an elegant restaurant that maintains a personal feeling.  I've always felt welcome and treated as a special customer.  I actually ate there last night.  I had the 16 oz Ribeye with none of the optional rubs.  It was fantastic.  Our waitress recommended a wonderful red wine that was a perfect complimented the meal.  It was a little more crowded than usual due to Restaurant Week in Madison but it was still top notch.    Park in the ramp right next door.  Delmonico's will validate."}
{"text":"Great steaks, decent drinks, OK service, nice restaurant.   Their steaks are good. I don't think they're prime and they're not aged as long as Chicago steakhouses (14-21 instead of the usual 28-32 days), but they cook them right. My steak was ordered charred medium rare. It came out nicely charred and perhaps toward medium, but it was quite easy to cut and chew, and the extra heat melted more fat, making for an unusually un-grizzly ribeye. Strip is also nicely done, and due to its thickness a bit easier to cook to temperature.   Cod was fresh and perfectly cooked, on an unusual but not-as-overwhelming-as-it-sounds carrot/ginger puree. Not a huge plate but recommended for a light meal.   Hash browns were second tier to places like Tornado Room, Smoky's, or the Wonder Bar but did the trick of being salty, crispy, and absorbing steak grease.   Service was fine, about average for Madison. Prices very reasonable for a steakhouse -- $28-$35 for a steak with potato. Booths are much nicer and less trafficked than the tables."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, but in the end - I loved the service and the food was ok.   Basically I gave the food 3 starts, but my server Jamie got 5 stars so I compromised with a 4 star review.  My steak was good - I ordered it medium rare and it was a lot closer to rare - but hey, I am adventurous.  My garlic mashed potatoes were over salted - not to the point of inedible - but definitely noticeable.  The appetizer was a bacon wrapped scallop - the scallop was well cooked, but completely overpowered by the bacon.  Maybe just ill conceived?  Bacon should be used to wrap things otherwise devoid of flavor.  I got the soup of the day - which I would rate just OK...sort of one note.  On the positive side - the drinks were great - and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"First let me say that getting here is a challenge.  Downtown Madison is NOT easy to navigate. Add in multiple street closures...well it wasn't easy.  We lucked out, though. Found on street parking.  It was also UW graduation weekend.   We were early so managed to get seated without having a reservation.  Our server, Julio, was excellent.  Because it was graduation weekend, the menu was pre fixe.  And that was fine.  My sweet wife had a filet and I took Julio's recommendation and ordered a dry aged NY strip.  We supplemented with the hash browns and garlic mashed.  The hashbrowns were very good, the mashed had more garlic than we preferred.  But the steaks, the steaks, were excellent.  A restaurant with steakhouse in the name and a menu with premium pricing should have excellent steaks.  And they were.    Creme brulle for desert.  Also VERY tasty.  Why four stars and not five?  Well, in my head, five stars are reserved for \"blown away.\"  Johnny Delmonicos is excellent for sure.  Was I blown away?  Not on the visit.  Maybe the next."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic; Liz rolled up my napkin and placed it back on the table when I went to the bathroom and I just put it on my seat. She was attentive, but not intrusive. Our plates were removed as soon as we put the fork down from the last bite of appetizers. It might've appeared hurried, but we actually didn't mind it.  As for the food, nothing too extraordinary. We ordered the fried calamari with sweet chili sauce, which I have at home, so it kind of made us laugh that we chose that. Loved that the batter wasn't so thick, but covered the calamari just right. I had the 6 oz tenderloin, perfectly medium rare (drool) with garlic mashed potatoes. The potatoes were spread almost all over the plate, which was okay for presentation, but the taste was delicious. Definitely garlic, but not overpowering. I could probably eat bowl after bowl of those potatoes. Then again, I love carbs, so there you go. My fiancé had the 10 oz tenderloin, perfectly medium. He ordered hash browns, which made me laugh and made him go \"hmm\" but he said it was good. Sautéed garlic spinach and mushrooms were our other sides. Love! The mushrooms weren't mushy and limp, which is always a plus for me. Although, it did come out in less than 2 minutes after I added it to our order. So, hmm.   Oh, we liked the steaks. Again, nothing too extraordinary. Didn't make me dance in my chair like awesome food would normally have me do. But it wasn't terrible.   We had nice seats by the window and an easy exit when it was all said and done (it was Valentine's weekend, of course). Good place. I'd like to try their lunch menu sometime."}
{"text":"The Cedar Plank Salmon is by far THE best salmon I've ever had.  The C.A.B. burger is one of my top 3 favorite burgers (self-proclaimed burger critic here).  Best Lobster Mac & Cheese  I've ever had (doesn't have that strong seafood taste/flavor that a lot if seafood Mac & cheese dishes have).  Both the steak Cobb salad and strawberry chicken salad are amazing (and huge- definitely can split these)  I don't think there's a dish you could go wrong with here (except during restaurant week when they had a po-boy on the menu- was not impressed. But it was a po-boy sandwich so, you know, not that shocking)"}
{"text":"Classy vibe with decent service and appetizers but entrees were disappointing.  I ordered the lamb shank special which was tough and barely warm.  Meanwhile, my fellow guest's steak was overcooked and waiter agreed it had to be returned.  I'd go back for drinks but not for a meal."}
{"text":"Like the mashed potatoes and the ambience.  Enjoyed the white cloth dining. Steaks disappointed me for the prices"}
{"text":"We dined again at Johnny Delmonico's yesterday.  We are regulars.  This is the best restaurant in Madison.  Great steaks, but just as great seafood or chicken dishes.  Wine list and cocktail list is outstanding.  The decor and ambience are what restaurants used to be, and should be.  You can sit at a tablecloth-covered table with a candle, enjoy a great dinner, and actually have a conversation without shouting.  And an adult-oriented clientele.  No screaming, running kids.   The last two weeks we have been served by Mel, one of the newest additions to the staff.  She is outstanding, with a great personality and impeccable service."}
{"text":"I want here for my graduation dinner and the filet mignon was amazing. My family and boyfriend were extremely happy with their meals as well. The whole establishment including the employees are classy and truly make you feel like you are getting your money's worth. I'd highly recommend this for a special occasion or nice dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!  Food was great..  waiter was a little hard to find at times but we went during dairy show and restaurant was busy! The best place I've eaten since I've been coming to Madison!!!"}
{"text":"After living in Madison for the last 24 years, I finally found my way to Johnny Delmonico's for dinner. And what a good thing! Lisa W. was our server and she was perfection - very personable, but not overly chatty and she checked in with us in a way that was non-intrusive and well-timed.  I got the 16 oz. ribeye with a baked potato and my husband got the 14 oz. New York strip with the hash browns. We both ordered our steaks medium rare. His came out perfectly, but mine was much closer to medium as opposed to medium rare. However, the steak was tender and incredibly flavorful so I enjoyed it regardless. I tried his hash browns and WOW, they were the best I've ever had. Crispy outside and tender inside with a buttery quality yet not greasy and tons of flavor without being overly salty. So jealous! Good to know for next time. We also shared a side of the brussel sprouts with gruyere cheese & bacon. Um, yeah...........order this side and share it. It's incredible on its own or spread on a baked potato. Sweet and tender with the creamy bite of the cheese and the smoky saltiness of the bacon. It's win-win-win.  We were too full for dessert, but I had a couple Cosmopolitans that were very nice. Not quite as amazing as the ones at Lombardino's, but good all the same. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"A luxurious high-end steakhouse with Equally high prices and top flight service.  One measure for me on service is the water glass test and they passed with flying colors.  No fewer than 3 different people kept our water glasses filled to the top while our waiter did an excellent job taking care of our needs.  One of the things that stands out about Johnny D's for me was the food quality.   The filet that I had was not only cooked perfectly (no trying to guess what medium will mean) but it had just the right amount of seasoning and was a very high-quality cut.  The sides are a la carte and also quite good.  Certainly the most expensive steak house in Madison that I've visited (our group of 6 was almost $100 per person) but given the quality and service I wouldn't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Waited entirely too long for a meal. Mediocre steak. Waited even tho we had reservations. Will not be back. Piss poor service."}
{"text":"As always, had a great meal there. For wine we drank Wild Hog 2007 Cab which was amazing. Waiter suggested hash browns and they were great. Had a NY Strip that was excellent. I suggest au poivre. For dessert had the lava cake and it fed four."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse! I'd try the caesar salad with any filet and you cant go wrong!   Nice atmosphere and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We had a really good time here. The steaks were flawlessly cooked, succulent and juicy. The service was also very good, as was the view. A better pick than Flemings or Ruth's Chris on the West side."}
{"text":"Yawn. Everything was fresh and the tasted fine. But, this is a very ordinary place.  The menu, food, decor, service, and clientele was generic.  The tenderloin cooked medium rare had excellent texture but the taste was bland.  Garlic mash potatoes, salad, and appetizers were average.   Seems like this place draws a lot of business travelers and government workers (supported by WI tax payers).  I would opt for Tornado club who serves a much more flavorful piece of beef."}
{"text":"Facility and atmosphere is what one would expect of a quality steak house. Dinner last night was a split decision: my guest's entree (Trio) was very good. I ordered the large filet, blue rare. My steak was charred a bit much, inside done properly. This is the second time I've tried it and on both occasions the quality of the meat was very poor- flavorless and chewy. The Wonder Bar offers much higher quality, even the chain steakhouses do better.  I'd suggest Johnny seek a new source of proteins.   Service was very pleasant and timed properly."}
{"text":"Heard amazing things about this place. Selected this place to celebrate 40th birthday with a group of friends. The selection of quality beers is extremely limited. The atmosphere was quaint. The service was horrible. For such a small restaurant it took almost 3 hours there to have orders taken to being served. Steak was very good, however I cannot get past the horrible service to ever go back."}
{"text":"Johnny's has some absolutely melt-in-your-mouth steaks, OR, some very on-par steaks. It seems to be  hit or miss. I only come here on special occassions as it is quite expensive to make a regular habit of dining here. But the last time I went I had the filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly, it practically melted in my mouth! The wedge salad wasn't bad either, an entire 1/4 of the head of iceberg lettuce with some tangy french dressing! And topping it off was my Van Gogh espresso vodka on the rocks from the \"overpriced\" bar.... For the prices you pay I did expect a bit more."}
{"text":"I came to Johnny Delmonico's on a Wednesday night for a client dinner, and had a positive experience.  The food, service, and ambiance were all great.  I enjoyed my mixed greens salad and 6 oz tenderloin with the garlic mashed potatoes - all were quite tasty!  I was less happy with my cocktails - both the strawberry mule and the cilantro cooler (can't remember the precise name) were a bit too sweet for me.  The service was quite good.  My client mentioned to the waiter that I wasn't a fan of my strawberry mule cocktail, and the waiter promptly offered to replace it with something else.  Unfortunately, I didn't like my second cocktail either, but I didn't want to complain about it and come across as a difficult customer.  The food came out quickly and our waiter was very attentive.  The one piece of feedback I'd have for him is that it would have been helpful if he waited for natural breaks in our conversation to return, rather than interrupt - I know that's not easy to do, but it would have been nice.  I appreciated the fact that the restaurant called in advance to confirm my reservation and mentioned that they validate parking.  Overall, I had a very positive dining experience here, and think it's a great spot for a business dinner!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is amazing. The food is so good. many meats and sea food choices. Beer - AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Service. Attention to detail. Wine. Wonderfully sourced meat and perfectly seared steak. We enjoyed this meal AND the ambience so much. It was a great spot for a romantic date and exceeded our expectations for food. Even the salad was fresh and perfectly crisp. I hope to return soon and i hope we get the same sever! He was knowledgeable and very helpful. All the stars to this place!!!!"}
{"text":"My 2nd review for this restaurant:  the last 2 times here they have been out of stock of one of my favorite wines (Silver Oak). We then tried another and they were out of that also. We tries some ahi tuna and they were out of that too. Last time we were here they ran out of oysters. I had the Australian lamb and it was blah. Someone else had it and it was like chopping rubber. I've had a lot of lamb in my life and this wasn't very good. I think it was the way it was cooked and not the lamb. I've had some amazing steak and lobster here so I left it at a 3/5."}
{"text":"Really nice food and the service was great. I wish I could recall his name but he was best server I've had in my entire life, before and now! As usual it's a little expensive but beats tornado out of the water- that's for sure"}
{"text":"Go see Kerry! And the  the ribeye with Mac and cheese and hashBrowns. You will have the best food and the best advice. We even added on the crab legs. The warm bread will change your life!!"}
{"text":"I love going to Delmonico's whether it's for cocktails or dinner.  I don't get to go often but when I do I love it.  The atmosphere is wonderful and the service is great.  I love their steaks but never hesitate to go for the scallops either.  I always start with the shrimp and it's always good.  We generally end with the chocolates and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a review of my lunch experience.  I had lunch with two friends last week and JDS completely failed on both service and food.  From being seated to the time we got our check was one hour and fifteen minutes.  Really, for lunch?  In fact, one of my guests took about three bites, asked for a box and almost immediately had to take her lunch with her back to her office.  Oh I forgot, my other guest ordered a plain hamburger, well done, on just a bun.  This is how he always orders a hamburger, so he is always very clear with his order, he knows is not common.  Pretty easy, right?  Instead, he gets a cheeseburger with some lettuce.  Wrong!  I got a simple steak sandwich at a steak house, and it was just plain bad.  No flavor, absolutely no flavor.  There was one highlight, the french onion soup.  It was very good.  Overall, an incredibly disappointing experience all around.  I would be very reluctant to go back for lunch."}
{"text":"We went to Delcomicos for our anniversary and they made it very special. I'll start with the good, the petit filet with wild mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes- seriously melts in your mouth! Excellent flavors. The waitress recommended a limited time mushroom topper that was more of an earthy flavor, and honestly they were awful. Just not for me, I think they are an acquired taste. I mentioned it to the waitress and they were so nice to take it off. I didn't even ask for it, so I'm great fun for that. We also Tried the scallops which the flavor was there, but were slightly underdone. The only reason for not 5 stars was the scallops and the oysters.  The oysters just had no wow factor. For the price, they were just not very good. But we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"One of the few real steakhouses in the Madison area.  I started with the french onion soup which was very good.  Couldn't try any of the appetizers because I'm allergic to fish.  Went with the 14 oz. tenderloin for dinner and it was very good.  Always get my steaks medium and they cooked it right.  One knock on this place is that it's very expensive.  Good food but smaller portions.  Service is usually very good and friendly."}
{"text":"- Dirty martini with blue cheese olives -  Excellent! - Calamari - Excellent! - Caesar with added anchovies - Excellent! - French Onion Soup - Excellent! - Shrimp Cocktail - Excellent! - Garlic Mashed Potatoes - Excellent! - 16oz wet aged Ribeye. - Whomp whomp over cooked, cut as a wedge vs. even thickness so rare/med rare on one end (asked med rare) and well on other end. Server comped me a creme brulee."}
{"text":"So much to review! The private room had good lighting, a nice quietness that eased conversation and attentive servoce. All in all it made my makeup look fabulous and holiday earting sparkle. Lets face it, we dont go to company holiday parties to eat steak, we go to impress each other.  Cocktails! Above average by a little. Had a dark n stormy and a colorado bulldog. The waiter faked knowing those drinks Very Well.  Tomato soup with feta: balanced and right Risotto: cooked well but bland Mashed potatoes: Very Good Steak: decent quality but cooked Very Well.  Creme Brulee: eh ita ok. Not enough crackle and depth. Fairly cold. Dark chocolate torte: very dark chocolate. Too dense for my subjective taste.  The four stars are for service and atmosphere. The food is a 3 star for the price."}
{"text":"Delmonico's is a nice take on a steak house. It's not a super-special place, but the food is done right, the staff is attentive, and there are some surprises on the menu. I've had better, but there is certainly nothing to fault at this downtown Madison restaurant.  We had the calamari as a starter and holy moly was it good. It's served tossed with a spicy-sweet chili sauce and peanuts. Very tasty. I had the Caeser salad to start my meal and the 6 oz tenderloin diana. Overall, I'd rate the steak a 3-1/2 stars. Although it was cooked perfectly and was as tender as could be, I was not a fan of the Diane sauce. Something was a little strong in it - I don't know if was the mustard or the wine used to deglaze, but it wasn't to my taste. Still, I'd go back here again."}
{"text":"Great service and nice atmosphere.  I had the scallops which were good although a bit rich for my taste (nothing low fat about that dish).  Service was excellent. Our waiter was patient with our table (not everyone could decide on dinner selections quickly) and helpful.   We found a Ramey Syrah on the wine list that was both delicious and reasonable - something you don't find on a lot of steakhouse wine lists."}
{"text":"We went back to Johnny D's last night hoping for the same great experience we had the first time here.  Unfortunately, even though our really good waiter told us everything we ordered would be cooked to our precise specifications, that didn't turn out to be true.  The entrees are in the $25 to $45 range and you'd expect that the food would be served 'as ordered'.  My husband and our friend ordered steaks, medium rare.  They both were delivered steaks that were medium well to well.  I ordered the scallops but requested that they be cooked well.  I don't like my scallops all 'jiggly'.  They were delivered pan seared only and quite jiggly.  I should add that our fourth diner was very pleased with her Shichimi Togarashi-Crusted ahi Tuna.    Even the bill showed the scallops were ordered 'well' so it wasn't the waiters mistake.  I've got to think there was a new chef in the kitchen or they were overwhelmed with more orders than they could handle.  By the time we left the place was almost filled to capacity.  Maybe they were short staffed in the kitchen?   Last point of dissatisfaction was the drink my husband ordered towards the end of the meal.  He requested a rye manhattan.  What he got was a very large glass of ice with a very small pour of something pinkish looking.  It clearly was not a rye manhattan.  To add insult to injury, they charged $14.50 for this mystery drink.    Three of us should probably have sent our meals back (plus the rye manhattan!) but that's just not something we are comfortable doing.  I used to go out to eat with my maiden aunts and be embarrassed when they sent food back or complained about little things.  I decided back then that I would not do that.    Our waiter was terrific.  He explained each of the specials in a way that left you smacking your lips for each of them!  And the ambience is clubby, woody, really comfortable with a small intimate bar and a few booths and high tops in the bar area.  I'm sure when we are in the Madison area we will go back to Johnny D's.  It was just too good the first time to give up on!"}
{"text":"Great food. The only thing keeping the review from an all out five stars is that it's a pretty loud restaurant. I love this place (and it's in a great location). Great food. If you're g0ing, don't waste your time on anything but the steaks. That's not to say everything else isn't good; just that you go to Delmonico's for steak."}
{"text":"This place I picked by name and didn't read reviews or make a reservation.  I walked in alone and the hostess greeted me with a sweet smile and put me at the perfect table.  My water glass was immediately filled.  My waiter came over, I ordered a glass of Pinot noir and reviewed the menu.  I ordered a lobster tail and Brussels sprouts.  The lobster tail was tender and sweet, the butter warm and clarified and the Brussels sprouts were creamy and delicious.  The bill was only $45 plus tip.  Great meal at a great price.  Enjoyed every bite.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Madison.  When my wife and I are in the mood to splurge this is where we end up. Great wine menu, great service, amazing steaks!"}
{"text":"ok, FINALLY made it here... sure won't rush back. Nice decor, but ordinary. Service was GREAT, Adrienne our server was awesome. Apps- shrimp cocktail, tuna , sclalops in bacon... all YUMMY- tuna was GREAT! we were a party of 8- my steak( ribeye) was a big ole disappointment. - i have NEVER had a bad ribeye, and at a steak joint?? hmmm.....creamed spinach was bland and the creamed corn was AWFUL and NASTY! others loved their steaks... mine was flavorless. if i do go back, it will be for drinks and apps...  was so hoping for more from this place."}
{"text":"Dinner service: excellent, exactly what I'd expect from a classic steakhouse.  Restaurant week lunch: did not meet expectations.  Dinner focus is steak and seafood.  Steak was cooked to the correct temperature and all of the options are dry aged.  Roast sweet potatoes&beets  and the mac&cheese sides were. Service is on point and attentive, but not obsequious.  I'm not a wine expert by any means, but I enjoyed what we ordered and the server made appropriate recommendations.    There were some snafus during lunch service that should not occur at this type of establishment.  Soup was a possible appetizer for the set menu, yet the server didn't tell us the soup of the day until asked.  The server didn't describe what types of fruit were used for the sorbet when it was delivered to our table.  The mac&cheese noodles were slightly undercooked.  Something fell apart during the restaurant week lunch, but I would recommend to those looking for a Madison steakhouse."}
{"text":"Food and service top notch. We had the calamari and scallop appetizer. Shared a dinner salad and both had tenderloin. It was perfect. A little pricey and the wine list was awfully pricey but the food was amazing. Atmosphere was very nice. They do clear out early. It was 10pm on a Friday night and the place was empty."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse. We had the crab cakes and oysters for the appetizers.  Both were delicious! The crab cakes were big and had that nice crunchy texture on the outside that you look for.    For the entree, I had the 16 oz ribeye. It was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount t of seasoning. It was very tender and tasted great. Rounded that out with the creamed spinach and asparagus. Both were on point and exactly what you'd want for a side with your steak.   Service was great. Our waiter was friendly and timely. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Got the steak I ordered, asparagus was the size of a tree and grilled perfectly. Would take all 5 star reviews with a grain of salt, as it was actually a 4.99 because the French Onion Soup burnt the roof of my mouth. Rumor has it their mashed potatoes and the the teriyaki sauce they put their grilled salmon in are out of this world. Waiters/waitresses were out of this world"}
{"text":"Definitely lived up to our expectations.  Our steaks were perfect, the waiters suggestions were spot on. We had a fantastic evening with first class service & a 5 star meal."}
{"text":"Ok - So it IS the first night of Madison's Restaurant Week, but isn't this the reason restaurants entice people to try their wares. and hopefully, come back again?    Sadly, Johnny's fell short on too many fronts.  Reservations were made earlier in the week for a party of 5 at 5:30 pm, this was an intentional early reservation to beat the Restaurant Week crowd rush. When I arrive at 5:30 pm I'm told by the host that 3 of the 5 are already at the bar with drinks.  I check-in with the host only to find that our table is not ready, seriously, you just told me that my party is at the bar, and our table isn't ready?  And now we wait, and the apologizing begins.    We get seated closer to 6 pm. and the dining room is still not that busy.  Restaurant Week restaurants offer a Prix Fixe dinner menu for $25 - choice of App. Entre.Dessert.  More waiting, our server arrives and we order. More waiting,  Appetizers arrive.  More waiting and 2 rounds of bread baskets later.  Our server now comes back to our table realizing we all ordered the steak, but failed to ask how we wanted it done-1 med well, 4-med rare.  Minutes later, our entres arrive.  We take note that it is now 7:20 pm.  We finish the meal at 8:00 pm.  The food was a scaled back offering fom their standard menu, we all get that, and the food was fine.  Worth the price paid, however, it could not make up for such poor service, and an unwillingness to make up for it with anything but \"I'm sorry.\"  Here's a thought, offer a round of drinks, a gift certificate, a discounted bill, something to show you are trying to get us to return.  I will not be returning anytime soon, restaurant week or otherwise.  Johnny's must earn my business back, and saying, \"I'm sorry.\" will not bridge this divide.  I hear the Tornado Steakhouse is good."}
{"text":"I am a 46 year old life long resident of Madison.  My wife and I went to Johnny Delmonico's last Saturday night for the first time.  The only thing I can say, why did I wait so long.  Kerry was our server.  The service and atmosphere were exceptional, definitely in the top three in Madison.  Thank you Kerry.  I ordered a caesar salad, 16 oz ribeye, hash browns, creme brulee and two old fashions.  The salad, hash browns and creme brulee were all very good.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly (medium) and the old fashions were definitely among the best in the Madison area.  I can only thing of 2-3 places in the Madison area that make an old fashion as good or slightly better.  Everything arrived in an appropriate amount of time and the steak was hot off the grill.  A little time for the steak to rest and it was juicy and flavorful.  This will definitely be our new \"go to\" place in Madison."}
{"text":"We ate all the meat! Lisa W. took very good care of us, and everything arrived at the table in a very timely fashion. (Given that every other restaurant had an hour wait just to be seated, we were grateful to get anything. And we feasted!) The decor is cozy and we had a little 2-seat table tucked in by a bookcase, which made us feel like the only patrons in the place.  Started with the beer tartare, which had the right amount of chew and seasonings. My husband had the beef tenderloin medallions with seared scallops, which was artfully plated (and he quickly destroyed). I had the seared ahi tuna and a mixed green salad, which suited me perfectly. It ended up being a perfect way to spoil ourselves."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for our tenth anniversary, it was fantastic.  Food was great, service even better."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in Madison. The hospitality was superb as well. There is nothing bad about this place. I was carefully attended to and was able to experience fine dining at its finest! If you are ever in Madison,please go here!! Sit at the bar, have a drink and a steak and just relax yourself! 5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"My bf and I went here last week for our anniversary, and it was delicious.   We got bacon-wrapped scallops for an hors d'oeuvre, and I got the filet and he got rib-eye, each cooked medium-rare. I loved mine and he loved his, but I didn't care for the flavor of his steak. He got the garlic mashed potatoes and I got the double baked potato- which was huge!   The server forgot to give us steak knives and was quick to leave after serving us, and we did not get our steak knives until 5 minutes later when he came back to check on us.  For is mistake we received free desert-  a yummy chocolate mousse cake.   Also we were seated by the window and one seat was cold and the other had the heater cranking on our legs. I was too cold and he was too hot so we switched and were both happy.   The bread was also very tasty and our server gave us extra to bring home to make steak sandwiches with our leftovers."}
{"text":"I visited in late June 2014 and got the 10 oz. dry aged NY strip with hash browns.  The hash browns were meh, just typical hash browns to me.  I wish I would have gotten something else.  The steak on the other hand was very good.  It was a choice steak rather than prime, but the flavor of the dry aged steak more than made up for that.  10 oz. wasn't enough, but then I didn't want to pay for a larger cut.  I had a glass of a cab. sav. that wasn't on the menu and it was quite tasty.  I've had better wine, but this one paired well with the steak and that is what I was looking for.  For dessert I got the cheesecake with raspberries.  There wasn't much for raspberries (2) or sauce, but that was just fine for me as I like cheesecake in and of itself.  It was creamy, but a little light.  I prefer a dense and creamy cheese cake.  The dessert was still good."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  The steaks are awesome, and the calamari will ruin all other calamari for you it's so good!  BUT, this is definately a special occasion restaurant!  It's pretty expensive."}
