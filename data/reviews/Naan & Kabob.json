{"text":"Yesterday me and my wife tried this resturant we ordered two types of kabab with rice, the lamb meat was awful smelly nasty and the chicken meat was hard and the rice cold, the resturant was cold too. Don't recommond this place to onyone."}
{"text":"It was my first time in an afqan restaurant.The food was really tasty and i really enjoyed it. The price is reasonable and the place is cozy and clean. I put this restaurant in man favorite list."}
{"text":"The restaurant is spacious,  has a lot of windows for sunlight, and very clean with comfortable seating.  You can sit in booths, on benches with cushions,  or tables. I went here with my family and ordered three dishes to share: the chaplee kabob, chicken breast kabob, and the waziri tandoori kabob (a tandoori chicken kabob and shish kabob). Everything was seasoned well.  I found the shish kabob to be a bit too salty for me.  The chaplee was okay...i think the one at afghan kabob is better. The chicken has the texture of salted frozen chicken breast that you buy in bulk... It's a bit too rubbery but the flavour was on point.  The portions are huge and we had to take home pretty much an entire dish of chaplee. You'll be full without the rice because the naan is plentiful. The naan tastes very fresh and is delicious. Overall it's a nice place. Not spectacular."}
{"text":"I was surprised this place didn't seem to have more traffic. The food, service, and prices are decent. Perhaps the chaplee kabobs weren't the best I've had but still good."}
{"text":"Heard from an Afghani friend that this was one of her favourite Afghani spots in the area, so decided to check it out...  I got the 1/2 chicken plate and it was delicious. Spicy but delicious. And plenty too! Their naan was soft and tasty too.  Next time will definitely try something different   Great patio for sunny days"}
{"text":"I was greeted right away by a super friendly lady who walked me through the menu and gave me suggestions on what I could order. She told me what she had tried and what she liked on the menu. Great first impression. The place is clean and bright."}
{"text":"Delicious food, very nice atmosphere.  The waziri tandoor chicken was some of the best I've had anywhere.  The salad is an afterthought, but I didn't even care.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was descent. But there was no cutlery and paper towels and the lady at front desk was extremely rude. The waitress / front desk lady should be taught how to deal with customers else they may lose valued patrons."}
{"text":"I went to Naan&Kabab few times and I liked it every time. The ingredients always fresh, salads taste delicious with fresh ingredients. The meat is tender, and good quality. Rice is good. I love the milk pudding. The place is modern and nicely decorated with lively colors and clean,  in contrary with the other Afghan restaurants with dark colored vinyl chairs, greasy and brown tables and trays. The music they play is always goes very well with the atmosphere. Staff is very nice and always looking for ways to satisfy their customers. I totally recomend if you are looking for an Afghan kabab place."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things! This is my spot right here. Whenever I'm hungry and I don't know what to eat I always end up coming here. So many choices between tandoori dishes, barg kabob, wraps (naan wraps yummmmm). Also the portions are HUGE for a really good price ! You can't beat thatthe staff are also really friendly and the decor is super cute. LOVE!"}
{"text":"Pros: Nice interior and seating, big servings and delicious mantu, good service Cons: slightly pricey, food was a bit bland   After hearing many good things about this place, we decided to give it a try. It has a very good location and is easy to find. The interior is very nice and different from the usual casual afghani restaurants. We ordered two appetizers and two main dishes and it was a lot of food for us. The portions are very big. The food was a bit bland and not as tasty as we expected. The mantu was excellent and was the highlight of our meal interestingly.  I also ordered the mango shake but it tasted kind of funny, like it had been sitting in the freezer for too long"}
{"text":"Kebabs are juicy and moist, never burnt since I've been going always fresh and delish!  I'm there almost every week as its down the street from work, nice clean environment and the young staff is always happy and cheery, makes a difference in my mind. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I hate to say this but my experience for this restrauant was not good at All. Rude customer service and rude behavior of all staff. I know Yelp will remove this as its keeping my reviews deleted dont know why but i will tell people Whats good n whats bad!"}
{"text":"This place has been renovated, food quality and price is really good. One of my favorite spots in Mississauga for kebabs"}
{"text":"The sitting arrangement is casual. For sauce you have to ask them otherwise they will not give you with food. This happened to me as i asked them for the sauce and the guy there told me that if you need it you have to demand from us. Its really strange thing....Food is better"}
{"text":"Order here three times and all three times the food tasted like it was drenched in mayo. Not up to par with real Afghan food for an Afghan. Watan Kabob is a lot better."}
{"text":"Nice portions, service was quiet pleasant, but I do believe in always excelling in customer service as they forgot my part of my order. Decor was nice very raw meets country. Open spacious and easy access to kitchen self service. Portions were enough for sharing. Would go again as matter of fact just hope their AC works next time.  Their dessert Ferni needs work on."}
{"text":"We loved this little place.  The service was A+, although it is counter service, the staff are very attentive to check in regularly with you to see if you are happy.  We tried the Manti (small which was still quite big) based on the yelp recommendations and were not disappointed.  It was so good and spicy!  Also tried the tandoor chicken with rice and salad.  I was not crazy about the flavour of the rice but my husband loves it.  Fresh naan too."}
{"text":"The Tandoori Breast Kabobs are flavourful and Lamb Shank is amazing. The meat in Chopan Kabob was absolutely inedible and total waste of time and money. The staff should try being nice."}
{"text":"First time, tried Wazeeri Chicken and was delicious. It wasn't busy at all 7 pm Friday and service was great."}
{"text":"Awful service.. They forgot about my meal.. Reminded then after 30 min, 15 min later, no meal. I decided to cancel the order.. They didn't even say sorry for their mistake, awful"}
{"text":"Location is great -- lovely patio -- interior is beautiful - interior is big for big groups as well.  Food is delicious, freshly made and many options of meat/veggie!   One of those places that you just GO  They also do catering!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 stars on an overall bases when comparing to other Afgan place in the Mississauga.  First impression when getting in... Quite nice, clean and very different decor then other Afgan places. Take a menu and have a seat, once decided you will have to order and pay for it at the till and wait for the food. The thing I liked they have the buzzer system similar to Panara bread, which was a good addition compared to other Afgan restaurant as the other restaurant have a number system which they yell out.   Food wise the price is higher than the other place with portion similar to other place for dishes with 2 kabaabs. The naan is average and slightly harder as opposed to being soft but they do make that fresh. The menu is similiar to other Afgan place but some new stuff has been added to the list and guess what! I tried those.   My order included Sultani Kabob (1 skewer of Beef Tenderloin & 1 Shish Kabob) and Waziri Tandori Breast Kabob (1 skewer of Tandori Kabob & 1 Shish Kabob). The food was hot, rice was cooked nice and meat was well seasoned, juicy and tender.  The service is a little slow but its not too bad. There is enough seating and Parking.  For my Muslim bro and sis - They serve Halal meat and state it on their site as well."}
{"text":"best place in the wolrd. everything is so tasty and the best place inthe wolrd. its so yummy and delicious. no place can beat this. and i am so picky with food but this place everything is so yummy. love everything here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit here and it looks like they renovated the interior quite a bit. My family and I ordered the choppan kabob, beef tikka, tandoori chicken and lamb shank with rice. The food is fresh and tasty, especially the naan. You can choose to have your meal with or without rice/naan.  They informed me that they were out of choppan kabob after I placed my order and the rest of our tables food was ready, which was a bit of a bummer. They also forgot to give us our drinks. I didn't mind too much because it was quite busy inside.  Side note.. the ladies washroom is extremely dim lit."}
{"text":"My favourite afghan food place. Very clean and good service. One of the few places that services mantu. Stuffed afghan dumplings.  A must try. All the Main dishes are delicious and fresh. Decor is good and seating is ample. I really love all the food here and am never disappointed"}
{"text":"Alaa Ali, I had  very bad experience with my kids and wife. The cashier had to take my order twice. The order was for dinning in. She insisted that i told her that it is  take away, when the order was ready and packed.  The Sultani (3 orders) after 30 minuets is not cooked well. The meet was red from inside, we have to give it back to re-cook it for another 10 minutes.  I have 4 kids awating to eat. The meet was hard. The order is missing baloni, the same cashier told me that i didn't order it and the payment did not go through. When inisted that i paid for it, she asked for the receipt, to find out that she was saying nonsens. We are six and the white sauce was for 4. I have to go for the third time to ask for 2 more. The other 2 oders was Tandori and it was not bad. It was terrible experience for me and my kids.   I do not recommnd the quality of food and service. This was on Monday 13 October 2014."}
{"text":"Considering I'm Afghan and grew up eating afghan food, this place is good. The food is fresh, friendly service and the staff speak English . They are getting  because I'm tired of all afghan restaurants that have the same \"naan, kabob and rice\" and not so tasty bolani -flat bread with potato filling. Our cuisine has more to offer! Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"After reading all the good reviews we decided to try this place out. I called in a take order, we ordered 1 Sultani kabob ( 1 skewer of tenderloin and 1 Skewer Sheesh Kabob,with Salad and Naan, and Choppan kabob ( 3 Lamb Loin Chops, with Salad and Naan, also ordered 3 Bolanee (home-made lightly pan fried naan, stuffed with potatoes, green onions and herbs, served with a side of homemade yogurt) I always order this item if an afghan restaurant has it on their menu. ( 1 order of Bolanee could be shared by 4 people )    Okay now comes to the quality and taste of the food; I have to say it was good, fresh, flavorful, the meat was cooked well and on the well side as well, but not over cooked The Bolanee was awesome but little bit spicy, if you are okay with little bit of chili flakes you should be fine.  Customer service could better, that being said it was not bad per say but odd. I asked over the phone ( as it was a take out order ) could I please get some extra hot sauce?, the reply I got was \"it comes with your order\", I know its comes with my order, but I wanted extra, really did not get an answer. So I was like Ok I'll just ask when I get there, I did ask how long would it take? The girl taking the order said 15 minutes. She did not ask my name or phone number nor did she give me an order number, I found out later why she did not ask any information. they make their customers repeat their whole orders.   So I get there 15-20 minutes, a girl working at the cash asked what did I ordered, so i had to repeated my whole order, paid, and I asked again can I please get some extra hot sauce, she replied, \"ask the back when you pick up your food\" to me that is not a providing a good customer service, all she had to say was I'll let them know, write notes, tell the expeditor, tell the cook, find my bag and set it aside. You could do tons of things to make a customer  dinning in or take out or pick up very happy, but in their case the girl did not seem to care.  Then I went the back, took a sit, and waited for 5-10, I asked for the \"hot sauce\" again to the back of the house, and they obliged, at last one guy came from the back with my food, and says the food was ready all this time but......( he never finished his sentence ) I am not sure what that meant, they forgot to pack my order?  At this point I am hungry, all I want is to grab my food and get out, so while I am grabbing my bags the guy states, \"always check your order\", No buddy! That is your job, as I am the customer, I should be confident that I would get my order correctly. it is kind of expected when you go to a good establishment.  Sorry guys' customer service is huge to me, that being said the girl at the back (expeditor) was really polite, and a gentleman working the grill came to the front was also polite and courteous     I will give them a second chance and see if they can wow me"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to go to Bamiyan Kabob because all my friends rave about it and I even had one friend visiting from Texas take it back with her because it's THAT good. The only problem is, Bamiyan doesn't have any proper vegetarian options so I've never bothered to visit.  When I heard about Naan and Kabob and saw they did have something I could have, I knew I had to check it out immediately. Luckily, this new location had just opened and it was conveniently located near Bloor-Yonge station. I went on a weekday right after work and it was actually surprisingly busy in there at that time. How it works is, you order at the front, grab a buzzer, find a seat and then when your buzzer buzzes, you grab your food from the counter. It's a mix between a sit down restaurant and a fast food establishment because there are servers who come by your table to refill water and make sure everything is ok.  I got the paneer kabob (legit vegetarian option) and it came with naan, rice, salad and two sauces. I'm honestly kind of upset how much I liked the food. I can't believe I've been missing out for all these years. As soon as I started eating, I knew I'd be able to eat this on a weekly basis. Flew to the top of my list. I could go on and on and on. It's simple and it's flavourful and it's affordable. Also, Naan and Kabob's namesake product, the naan, was soft and chewy. It wasn't like Indian Naan which can sometimes be a little oily or buttery. This naan didn't have any butter on it and it was fluffy and came out hot. It went really well with all the food and can also be enjoyed plain.  They offer many different items on their menu including mains, appetizers, desserts. The flatbreads also looked good, might get one of those next time (maybe tomorrow.. writing this review is making me hungry...)"}
{"text":"Came here during the week for a quick dinner, I definitely recommend getting the upgrade to the qabli rice. I got one of the larger combos with 2 skewers, I didn't like what they had on the menu so I made my own. I got the barg with an extra tandoori breast skewer with qabli rice, omg it was so hot, fresh, and they made it much quicker than Bamiyan. I also got their mantu, this is one of the few Afghan restaurants to offer it (only reason I came here). Some people think it's fried but it's actually boiled dumplings with lentils on top. I really enjoyed it as the boiled dough texture does not bother me. Everyone seems to be comparing it to Watan so I'll have to try there next! This place is obviously better than Bamiyan, they are doing so well they are opening one near Markham & Sheppard and have one in Scarborough Town Centre as well."}
{"text":"We go to naan and kabob often, probably once every three months. The food is incredible and so is the service, however the cleanliness of the restaurant is sometimes questionable. There have been times where we have had fruit flies and other bugs around our table, of course this could be due to the fact that the restaurant also has an outdoor patio.   Regardless of the matter, we continue to come back because we enjoy the food and service so much. All dishes are really good but if this is your first time going I would recommend getting the mantu!  Lastly, the decor is very beautiful, trendy and chic!"}
{"text":"Naan and Kabob has some of the best Afghan food I've tasted, and it makes it so much better that the prices are more than affordable. Very friendly staff (and the girls are very pretty), and the overall atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"Amazing Afghan food! I placed an order through uber eats. The food came within 30 minutes and was still nice and hot! The mantu was delicious. The Bolani was good just wish it was pan fried and a bit more crispy. Potion sizes are more than generous..enough for 2 meals. I'll definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"If they don't add the garlic sauce, the meat will not go down your throat. First and the last time for me."}
{"text":"I was so sad when I saw this place burned down to ashes. So happy they're renovating and reopening. Food is excellent, priced well and service is prompt and courteous. Highly recommend you pay a visit once they reopen.  Best items: the bread, their mantu (dumplings) and bolanee, the waziri kebab!"}
{"text":"My first Afghan experience was at Watan Kabob, which is not far from here. Both are good, but I think N&K is slightly better because their menu selection is better.   We came as a party of 4. We had Waziri, Sultani, Qabli Palau, and Mantu for appetizer. 3 mains + 1 app was enough for 4 people. Actually...more than enough. Each dish had a salad, lots of rice, and a nice portion of meat. The kabob dishes come with bread. The kabob dishes were more or less what I expected. I live near Yonge/Finch which has quite a few Iranian restaurants so I'm used to eating kabobs. Afghan seasoning is different from Iranian. Both are delicious. And the beef tenderloin pieces were large and VERY tender. Same for the chicken breast pieces.  I was very happy with the Qabli Palau and the Mantu as these are new dishes to me. Mantu was unique, but not so mindblowingly good that I'd crave them. I'd recommend them as it's a unique dish that you won't find easily. With the Qabli Palau You get veal AND curry chicken (which is different from Indian curry). The carrots are slightly sweetened and soft so they go well with the rice.   It's very close to a 5 stars. To me, price-value has to be there for me to give a place 5 stars. This doesn't mean expensive is automatically bad in my books. It just means food need to be expensive for a good reason. I've given good ratings to some expensive places before. N&K I find just a little expensive, especially when I have so many Iranian restaurants in my area as a benchmark. Iranian food and Afghan food use essentially the same raw ingredients except for seasoning. N&K needs to shave $1-2 off to be on par with the Iranian counterparts. You probably don't think $1-2 is a lot. To me, it is a ton because I eat out a lot. $1-2 per dish translates to 10-25% after taxes. It's like an extra meal every week when you eat out almost every day.   By the way, like most middle eastern eateries, there's practically no service, and you don't pay tip. You order your food, get a pager, and get your food when it's ready. There's no one to serve you.   Recommended. It's definitely a contender if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken kofta meal through feedback. I didn't dine in so the interior and atmosphere of the restaurant isn't taken into consideration when I'm reviewing this restaurant. The portion sizes were great and the food was pretty good, but I've definitely had better elsewhere."}
{"text":"EDIT: changed from 1 star to 3 stars. Mo came by asking how things were and I told him how disappointed I was with the whole meal and experience. He told me he would remake the whole meal to make things better.  Was really impressed every single piece of meat was so juicy. The large meat didn't break apart when we cut it. The naan was fresh, you could honestly smell the difference. The fries were piping hot when they came out too. Also gave us a mango lassi on the side. Would consider coming again if they get it right on the first try.  Previous review: This place is very disappointing. Was really looking forward to naan and the one we were given was stale and smelled like it was going bad. Not only that it was also very burnt and stiff.   To add on that, our friends got a platter of fries and it was practically still frozen when it came out. They brought out the fries and it was still cold in the centre and a lot more salty. Do not come if you can avoid it."}
{"text":"It was good food and the portion was a good size. Price wasnt too bad either (12$ for chicken classic) but the reason i only give it 3 stars is because it wasnt anything too special honestly, theres better out there. And i know this is afghan food but they didnt have fries or ketchup on the menu so that disappointed me big time. Because seriously, Who doesnt have ketchup in a restaurant?"}
{"text":"Have driven by many times through this location and wondered, how they would be. Got a Groupon and decided to give it a try for their breakfast menu.   Nice set up in front and looks quite good and does not looks an ethnic restaurant.   Ordered a Moroccan Scramble , a Desi Thali, a Foole and  a Vegetarian Western and mango shake and thick salty butter milk type drink.   The Moroccan came with Foole spread on top of the eggs and toast and a tiny salad and a wedge of avocado. The Foole elevated the eggs and was good.   The Desi Thali came with a paratha and a Channa (chickpea) bowl and a bowl of spiced potatoes in a thick gravy, and some side olives and pickle. The chickpeas was good and potatoes were OK. The olives and pickle did not go with thaali and the paratha not quite good - too greasy and crispy and quite small. Not quite worth $10+ price  The Foole came with a naan. The Foole (mixed beans - spiced) was the best. Nicely spiced and flavoured. The naan quite good as well.   We asked for a Vegetarian Western Omelette and it came a chunk of beef. When pointed, the server and cashier apologized and was quickly replaced. The Western was good and came with roasted potatoes and toast. The potatoes looked red and spicy but we're not   The mango shake was perfect and the buttermilk very salty for our liking   Did not look like a place for coffee so skipped. Very limited options for vegetarians for meals and breakfast pricey if not for Groupon."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Wednesday night. The atmosphere is modern and casual, which I really like! You place your order at a line in the front, and are given a buzzer that'll notify you when it's time to pick up your food on a tray. You can also ask for a jug of water from the front for your table.   I got the waziri tandori platter (without the extra rice), which included a chicken tandori kabob, a beef kofta kabob, salad, naan, and two sauces. All the food tasted great except the naan, which was a bit underwhelming (but not bad by any means). I'd definitely be back when I'm in the mood for a casual bite!"}
{"text":"My experience here was the worst ever in Mississauga. I am new to Mississauga, just moved from Toronto so I'm trying new places. But as soon as I stepped in this place I knew it was probably not a good decision I made. We enter, and out of three people working in the front, none said hi even though we all could clearly saw us. They literally kept ignoring us pretending they never saw anyone coming in. So we say hi and no one answers. Obviously we have to talk to them as we need to place the order but they were very rude. That alone was enough for me to say I will never return. The food was okay. Absolutely nothing special. The rice was undercooked as well. The place was full of flies. Very dark as well. Also, they kept switching their music. Every single song being played was skipped half way through. The songs were all arabic, I don't understand Arabic anyways, but it was literally annoying. Never going back nor recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"Nice new kabob place centrally located. Most kabob places in Mississauga are in the east end.   I had the 1/2 chicken it came with naan, rice and salad. They had a grand opening special of 20% off.  I cant remember the total but the food was good. the chicken was nice and spicy with lots of flavor.   I would defiantly come back."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly nice. Great place to go with your coworkers for lunch. Foods great!"}
{"text":"So for those that wonder about eating 'Afghan food' have zero fear there is no better place to eat that Naan Kabob!   I suppose to be fair I haven't been able to move past the Grilled Chicken because it's that good...in fact it's amazing I can't get enough   Essentially this spot has become my favorite Friday...Saturday and some times Sunday spot. the amount of food you get for $9.99 is borderline highway robbery   You get freshly baked bread, small salad, and seasoned rice with two chicken kabobs considering that McDonald's is pretty much 10 bucks for a big mac combo you are much better off eating freshly prepared food that will fill you for hours on end - please note I eat enough to feed a small country   I can't speak to other middle eastern places personally but I don't think I am interested in trying simply because the service is excellent the staff are friendly and they are able to satisfy the hungriest of eaters...namely me  viva naan kabob!"}
{"text":"After seeing the Scarborough location on Restaurant Takeover,  I was inclined to try the newly opened Mississauga location.    Likes:  -Clean -friendly staff -meat was well seasoned and tender -buzzer system similar to Panera bread  Dislike: -portion was smaller than other Afghan places -naan was crispy as opposed to soft. -naan came 3-5 minutes after the meat (i had finished 1/2 my meal by then).  I ordered the Waziri combo without rice and the taste was very good, however it didn't have any \"kick\" to it or not enough of a charcoaled meat flavour.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure a lot of people would love this, but it just felt boring and too safe to me.    Also, I didn't like the fact that the naan bread came a few minutes after the entree.  I was eating alone and starving so I had eaten 1/2 my meal by then.  It kind of ruined the experience.  I love to dig into bread before I have my meal.  Verdict: It's worth a try if you are not as adventurous to try Bamiyan or Pamier, or if you want to bring a first timer to Afghan food."}
{"text":"When we lived in Mississauga we had dinner here at least once a week.  Their Tandoori chicken is perfectly seasoned and the rice is awesome.  Side salad and naan bread and it's a perfect dinner.   They now serve breakfast Saturdays and Sundays 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.  We're hoping to drop by on a weekend to check it out.  They also have table service now which is great.  You still order and pay at the front but they bring the food to your table now.  We love this restaurant.  It's a must for a quick and healthy dinner in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Chicken breast kebabs and tandoori chicken was very good.  Choppen, beef kafta and  chapli kebabs were chewy and fatty.  Naan and firnee were good but pricy.  Food is mild and quantity ok.  Overall good."}
{"text":"Ok I'm giving this place a 4.5 stars due to reasons though Watan is still my most fav place to eat Afghani food(taste wise)but this place this-location has it all.  I was having my biweekly craving for Afghani food and decided to go to my ever faithful Watan but the lines were so long and I wasn't quite in the mood to wait so instead we decided to try Naan & Kabob even though the ratings were just OK, however we gave it a shot.I was overall so pleased with my experience and do plan on coming back again.  This place has such an open and welcoming feel to it and the patio is absolutely adorable.I loved the casual decor and little details they have which most Afghan quick eat restaurants lack.  So you walk in grab a menu and sit where ever you like.Then you go back to the counter place your order/pay and let the cashier know your table number.Soon the food is served at your table again unlike many Aghan quick eat restaurant.I liked their concept!  The other thing I liked was there's a counter by the kitchen which has paper plates,cutlery, water and cups so we don't need to stand in line or beg/bother the staff for them.  Now coming to the food.So the food was fresh and hot.The meats were flavorful and juicy.The naan was standard.The only thing I didn't like was their white sauce it tasted more like mayo and was thick I guess I like the runny tangy white sauce.They also carry hot sauce you just need to ask them.  The service was absolutely top notch that night, food came out within 10 mins of placing the order and the girls were friendly and fast.I didn't use the restroom but my husband did and said it was clean."}
{"text":"This place really left a deep satisfying impression on me. I'm really glad that I discovered this place and was able to sit down and have a really delicious dinner.  This place delightfully straddles the line between a more formal sit-down restaurant or an upscale casual restaurant. The service was quite smooth and the servers were so kind and attentive.   They brought a bottle of water to our table and even helped us take away our plates/cutlery/trays at the end of the meal. You keep your buzzer near you so you know when to go to the counter when the food is ready. Warning that the buzzer will definitely get your attention and there was not person that I saw (including myself) that was startled by it. Haha.  The restaurant is wonderfully decorated inside with some nice artwork on the wall, some cozy and comfy booths, and tables mixed with chairs/backless tools. It feels homey and like you are sitting in your own living room.  The menu offers a lot of different tastes of Afghan street food and I really took my time going through the menu. They offer appetizers, salads, small plates, big plates, and group platters to satisfy everyone's hunger levels. I wanted to try everything but kept it sensible in the end. It proved a wise decision.  I love the gaminess of lamb so when I came across their signature bone-in lamb shank, I felt like it was calling to me. BOOM.  We got a mango smoothie and I was overly curious about the doogh (traditional mint yogurt drink). The mango smoothie was not overly sweet and was the right viscosity. The doogh is definitely an acquired taste with the tartness of the yogurt hitting your tastebuds and then the menthol flavours following afterwards. I think both drinks would be effective in subduing the extra spicy flavours of the Afghani hot sauce.  The lamb shank oozes value for money in my eyes. Maybe it was the particular piece that was on my plate but it was very generous for an up-scale casual place. The meat really falls off the bone with not a lot of effort from your utensils while the seasoning is solid and complement the lamb flavours. I can tell you that I picked that shank clean to the bone.  The long grain brown rice tossed with the fried sweet carrot strips and juicy sultana raisins was delightful in its own right. We had a great time marvelling at how much just carrots and sultanas can enhance a side of rice.  We haven't even gotten to the side of delicious chicken curry that comes with the meal or the fresh naan in the basket next to it! It's almost not needed yet it is!  I was heading towards a serious food coma after helping to finish my partner's waziri plate of tandori chicken and ground beef skewer. That plate was pretty delicious too but the brown rice with no sultanas and carrots just wasn't the same.  This place is just down a short way from the Yonge-Bloor station south exit and I can see myself coming here again and again in the future. I might never get past ordering the lamb shank dinner lol."}
{"text":"Went by after picking up a  friend near by and seeing that a few fellow yelper friends had given them a good rating and I always drive by on my way somewhere else.  We ordered the chicken breast and beef kabob plates. I love that they have a choice of with or without rice and with an actual price difference. Especially for lunch when you don't want a super heavy meal.   Lunch was under $10 which is always a plus. We went and sat down with our buzzer and after about 5 mins our server came by to inform us the buzzer wasn't working and that our food is ready on the counter near the back. Happy he came by to let us know, but wish we knew the food wasn't picked up at the front.   The decor really screams Food Network (since they were on restaurant Takeover), a huge difference from other afghan restaurants in Mississauga. It's nice and refreshing. The only issue we had was that we sat by the window to get enjoy the sunny day. After sitting down, we saw that the floor under the table was littered with rice. For the 45 minutes we were there, no visible cleaning was being done so not sure what their schedule is for that.   Our food was delicious, the chicken wasn't dry and was perfectly seasoned. There were 5 or 6 pieces that came with the meal, so worth it. I love the hot sauce they have on the table, except when it popped open onto my friend's hand but we used their fresh and warm bread to sop it up. Wish the salad wasn't iceberg but the sauce that came on it was really good and garlicky. I also appreciate the extra tomato salsa on the side, definitely a balanced meal.   Another plus is that they have an patio in the back. Next time I'll try their home made ice cream :)"}
{"text":"A friend yelped this place out while we were nearby and this place has some great Afghani food. I don't often frequent Mississauga so I can't compare it to other establishments here but this place is comparable to the places I have tried in Markham/Scarborough.  I did not expect this place to look as modern and fresh as it did so I was impressed with that. It's a very clean place as well. There's plenty of things on the menu to try with some more unique offerings compared to your standard kabob place.  The food is fresh and delicious. Everything was piping hot when it arrived, you actually have to wait a while before taking a bite! The tandoori chicken breast seasoned perfectly and was tender and juicy. The meats were grilled perfectly. Value was okay, I felt there could have been slightly larger portions, especially comparing to other places. For example, there could have been more salad and tomatoes.   Customer service could have been better. Water and naan took a while too long to come despite our table being one of two tables."}
{"text":"When I found the place, and found out they serve Afghan food, I was anxious and looking forward to trying it.  The place looks really cool, very modern and trendy. The staff was pretty friendly. I don't like when the wait staff handles food, especially without gloves. :( I tried the chicken kebab, one of the easiest to make, and usually tastes pretty good.  The kebab was pretty mediocre. I didn't like the fact it was stuffed with more lettuce and very little chicken."}
{"text":"Ok.  It was my first visit. Nice staff at cash. Ordering process was kinda slow.  The place attracts a Nice crowd.   The line to order my have been ow but there were plenty of tables. I decided to go for the Chapli Kebab, salad, bread with and extra piece of Shish Kebab.  It came out to just under 15 bucks. They gave me a pager and off I went to find a table. About 15 mins went by and the pager went off.  That wait wasn't too bad but I was extremely hungry.   The Chapli can only be described as yuck. They grounded up the rubber cuts, spiced it up and pan seared it. I eaten a lot of Chapli from many diff restaurants. This Chapli takes last place.  Each bite of the Chapli had bouncy bites of chili infused rubber Lol. The Shish Kebab was delicious but very small. Come on now. You want people coming back for more eats? Up the meat portion size. Kudos to the Mildly spicy salsa.  But why the extra salad dressing?   Oh well. I don't think I will be going back. Take care people of Yelp."}
{"text":"My BF's mom brought us home some lunch from here today and I was pleasantly surprised.  We had the beef kabobs, spicy chicken (not sure of the exact name) combo with rice, salad, and bread to share.  I really enjoyed the freshness of the meal and the ability to combine the dishes into an awesome naan sandwich thingy.  Creamy sauce on the salad and on the side was tasty. Chicken was nicely spicy, beef was flavourful. I loved the rice, which was spiced and tender. Salad was crisp and fresh.  We will definitely return to try the in store experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav places to get some lunch at. The Kebobs are fresh and juicy the rich is rich in flavor and the salad is just right."}
{"text":"I love Afghani food and places like N + K are why.   You order off of takeout menus and pay before you sit down. You'll get a buzzer and that's when you know to go up and get your food.   I usually get the boneless chicken breast kebab with rice.  I've always found this quick service restaurant to be clean and inviting, with a great ambience (fun decals).   The food has always been flavourful and I absolutely love their naan -they bring it fresh and warm."}
{"text":"Very lovely atmosphere, it's well designed.  The food is good, not as good as Bamiyan though. However, the place looks a lot nicer so this wins for me."}
{"text":"Have never been more impressed with tandoori chicken or lamb shank. Lamb shank came with side of curry -- talk about 10/10 value meal! Everything was super fresh and the portions were very generous, too. Coming back for the group platter soon!"}
{"text":"Stumbling across Naan & Kabob last night was one of the best things that could of possibly happened. This place is located right across from a Value Village and in between two other restaurants. This place is basically an Afghani restaurant which specializes in \"Street Food\". This was my first time eating Afghani food and even though the pictures looked incredible I still didn't fully know what to expect. This place looks absolutely awesome, the walls are black and on top of being super clean, it looks very modern inside. The staff was super friendly during our visit even when the place was packed from front to back. I ordered the Waziri Tandori kabob meal with white rice. This meal was absolutely amazing, it had both Tandori chicken and a shish kabob as well and both were some of the best things I've had in recent memory. I also ordered a side of naan and it was a good as it gets. Eating at a place like this makes me want to try so many more things. I will 100% be coming back here in the future, highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I got the ground chicken skewers rice plate. It also comes with bread, tomatoe salad and iceberg lettuce salad.  The plate had many different spices on it.  I found most of the dish to be too dry.  Cost is $9.99 and $1 extra for rice.  Portion size was larger than most places. Next time I would pass on the rice and try out a different meat skewer."}
{"text":"Naan & Kabob is an Afghan restaurant.  It reminds me of a upscale fast food place.  We wanted to try something different.  You order at the counter and they give you a buzzer. While waiting in line a guy in line told us not to get the wrap, the platter is better.  He said the wrap had a lot of lettuce.   I ordered the N & K Grill plate with rice for $16.99.  It was a huge portion.  It also came with naan bread.  This could feed two people.  You get two sauces: one mild spicy and the other is garlic Tzatziki.  The plate consisted of two salads:  green and the other tomato.  The classic chicken and the rice was good.  The Tandori chicken and the Shish kabob was a tad dry.  I had to take the naan bread home couldn't finish it all.  May come back to try the lamb shank."}
{"text":"Nice decor, lovely staff, and good-looking food.  Unfortunately, I've had to wait 35 minutes for my food so I can't comment on that yet.  Staff has been very polite and apologetic. But I now wait five minutes more (they just started my order--there are only three other customers).    Well, food arrived and it's delicious. Chicken Tandoori platter--full of flavor and spice, nicely complimented by the rice, a refreshing chopped tomatoes, and salad.  Naan bread is great.  The baklava treat is just ok.  So bottom line--this relatively new addition to Downtown is still working out some kinks.  But worth a try."}
{"text":"In the mood for traditional Afghan food thus Naan was close to the hotel. It's a fast food style place where you pay/order and get a buzzer; seating is on you, might add I settled on the second floor. Ordered the NK (mix grill) which was good and the chicken curry which was not spicy and the chick was pretty dry tasting....maybe it was the white meat....recommend using dark thigh meat. The rice could have been better and with more flavor, in Nan Kebob defense I'm comparing the rice to a local spot I go to....the counter guy was nice enough to give me extra hot + white sauce and they give you bread as well. Give it a shot if you want some quick eats, understand they have multiple locations."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and there's nothing like it around here. Delicious food, amazing service, beautiful interior. I would eat here 3 times a day if I could. Very reasonably priced for what you get."}
{"text":"A very nice and clean place with a nice interior design.  Munir, the gentlemen at the cashier was kind and friendly.   The food is frech and very tasty.  An unfortunate thing is you cannot leave tips when paying by card. For such an excellent service, there should be an option.  10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"Naan & Kebab is THE best afghani place in GTA! The meat is juicy, tender and cooked to perfection, rice are perfectly seasoned and words cannot describe how delicious their soft fresh naan is! Highly recommend this gem of a place if you want some great naan & kebab!"}
{"text":"went here today, it was spacious, clean. we grabbed a window seat. I got the minty yogurt thing (never had it, so i was surprised by the taste, it tasted like watery version of a sauce lol. maybe don't order this if you're not used to it). I got a kebob platter and lamb shank w/ curry on the side to share. I loved everything! I loved the rice, the meats were tender and juicy, and mostly i loved that reddish sauce they gave you on the side that i initially dipped the meat in and eventually mixed into the rice. anyway, sorry if the review reads as ignorant, as i never really had this cuisine before, but I really enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. Just had dinner there and the kabobs were outrageously delicious. Staff are very friendly, warm and very helpful. Would certainly go back on my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I usually get the lamb shank plate which the picture doesn't do justice. The lamb is extremely tender and it even comes with a side of chicken curry which is just unbeatable value. I've also tried their other meat plates which are also quite delicious but nothing comes close to the lamb!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh, delicious, and authentic Afghan street food, I highly recommend @naanandkabob  This place serves absolutely mouthwateringly tasty shish kabob, paneer kabob, chaplee, waziri, and tandori all marinated with a rich blend of spices and herbs for a juicy, tender, and succulent taste. As well, their mantu (dumplings filled with sauteed onions and ground beef drizzled with seasoned yogurt) and bolanee (naan stuffed with potatoes, green onions, and herbs) make for savory appetizers that are a must try! Naan and Kabob truly does a tremendous job at bringing out the rich Afghan culture that can be savoured through the taste of any of their dishes. - #naanandkabob  For photos, check out my Insta! @tacobelle._"}
{"text":"Good service. I tried the specialty and I liked it. The carrots, rice, raisins mixed with a bit of hot sauce made a nice combination.   The lamb was cooked nicely, even if the portion was small.   I liked the hot sauce and the ticket curry soup was a nice touch. I was filled after thus meal and would go back. As a bonus the girl at the front desk was very helpful and provided us with a lot of valuable information about the menu."}
{"text":"While sitting in the plaza parking lot, trying to decide where to eat, I spotted the Naan & Kabob sign.  (Their Scarborough location was featured on an episode of \"Restaurant Takeover\".  However, the last time I was actually in the area, I was stuffed from eating at another nearby restaurant.  It's strange though 'cause I always have room for Patisserie Royale...which is their neighbour!  Ha ha.)  Recognising one of the owners who was featured on the show, I asked when they opened.  He said 2 weeks ago.  The location seems to be fitting are there are quite a few kabob places in 'ssauga now, including:  Watan, Bamiyan, Pamier, Afghan Kebob, and the list goes on.  No menu is posted.  Instead, they have takeout menus to order off of.  After I ordered and was given my buzzer, I asked owner when you pay, he said, \"Whenever you want\".  So they're either relaxed people OR they're still trying to figure things out.  I ordered their Tandori Breast Kabob w/ salad - $8.99 and WOW.  Taste was fresher and spicier than my usual place, Watan.  There is also attention to plating, as per what they were taught via the Food Network show.  Portions are a tad smaller than Watan.  Order came with a naan which was fluffy, best when eaten warm.  My friend had the Mantu (dumplings) - $6.99 and they were quite good too!  I also tried their \"Tealicious\" blend of tea which was very nice.  I tasted vanilla, cardamom, and some citrus peels.  It was a relaxing blend for all you tea lovers!  Atmosphere:  They definitely carried over most design aspects from their Scarborough location.  And since they just opened, it as nice 'n quiet.  Not as bustlin' as Watan, up the street, so that was a nice change!"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. Food has exotic taste and the service is quick. Ambience is also nice. Try the bread, baked on premise."}
{"text":"I thought the food was pretty good, but as there is a lot of competition for afghan food in the area, its tough out there (bamiyan, watan, etc.)  I got the tandoori waziri combo (tandoori kebab and ground beef kebab). It was pretty good but i feel like the tandoori kebab is better at bamiyan and watan, but it definitely isnt bad.  I also had the bolanee (potato stuffed roti is the best way i can describe it) which i thought was definitely worth trying and pretty comparable to what i had at the other afghan restaurants."}
{"text":"Better than Paramount! Love the tandoori chicken- juicy, tender, and luscious. Portions were so filling I left in a full-on food coma. Would definitely return for the group platter!!!"}
{"text":"I saw this newly decorated restaurant on yonge street. The food looks good in the photos so I decided to try it today. We ordered lamb rice, mixed naan and milk pudding! I have to say that the food, service and environment all deserve the five star! Especially it is my first time to have sweet carrot and raisins on top of my rice! Milk pudding especially stood out with the thick texture!"}
{"text":"I came by several months ago whilst in the area and on my lunch break. They had a lunch special for under $12 that included protein, rice and salad. The kebabs were tender, juicy and flavourful and the salad was filling. The amount of rice provided was excessive considering you get freshly baked bread with your order. The people working behind the counter were kind and generous. The establishment was very clean and spacious."}
{"text":"This our family's best place to dine. We live the food here and we eat till we explode !!"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised to see so many negative comments about this place. This is my favourite kabob place in Mississauga.  This restaurant is spacious and clean. I really like the decor too. I have never been disappointed with my food here. I usually order the chicken kebob with salad and naan and every time it's perfectly spiced and cooked. The chicken is always so tender and juicy. Maybe their other dishes are not as good? I guess I better stick to the chicken then! Anyway, I will keep coming back to Naan & Kabob. I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"N&K nailed it! Their food is delicious, the meat is super juicy, the price point is great, and the portions are generous.   I live around the corner and have been back for take out a number of times. My favourite dish so far is their kofta, but all of the kabobs are fantastic as well! I always upgrade to the rice with raisins in it.   The interior is fine - modern, clean, nothing special. Would I come here for a sit-down, romantic date night? Probably not, but I have been back numerous times for delicious takeout, and I always (always!) grab a mango drink for the walk home!"}
{"text":"Wow! First, the interior is so much more beautiful than the locations in Scarborough. The patio and very sleek interior makes it very comfortable to be in. You feel like you are getting the real dine in experience vs a casual dinner spot.   The service was really good and the food is actually very consistent with the other locations (from what I found)   I personally loved the Kabli rice (rice with raisins and carrots) as well as the sultani Kabob. I also tried the chickpeas and loved the flavour it had.   The one thing I wouldn't recommend is the mango smoothie. I personally love the mango smoothie from bamiyan as it is more cold, light and filled with a rich mango flavour. In comparison this one is very heavy and has a strong taste is yogurt."}
{"text":"Delicious plates. Good portions and good prices. The bread is freshly made in the restaurant. Strongly recommended. The prices are around 9 to 12 dollars. It is a self-service restaurant so save on tip!"}
{"text":"aww oh yeah! a new very good eastern food place with very tasty fresh ingredients and generous Portions. nice staff, very clean and nicely decorated place. when i started to be fed up of the basic falafel shawarma places, the cheap alibabas, expensive and not good paramount or just ok ghazale, this new spot is really great! let s hope it remains that nice, good, quality, still quiet and clean as it is now."}
{"text":"I love the food here so tasty and really welcoming staff!!! I came here for food and chicken and wow!! So fresh and good!!!"}
{"text":"Another busy restaurant. Good food reasonably priced. Ample parking available, a must go!"}
{"text":"I got their N&K Grill and Firni.  I'm not a big fan of non-fried chicken, but it was actually really good and tender. I would prefer it if it had a bit more flavour, but it went well with the sauce and rice they served it with. Their Shish Kabob was also nice as well.  I wasn't a big fan of their naan or why they served naan on top of a pretty filling and complete dish. And I didn't really like the naan that much either (probably a personal preference).  I also brought a Persian friend and he later told me that him and his dad changed their go-to place for kabon/chicken plates since they used to leave downtown so satisfy their cravings.  Their Firni was also pretty good. It was creamy and it wasn't too sweet (I hate it when places add too much sugar)."}
{"text":"I am so delighted that I came here to eat. How it works is there are small menus on the counter that you can read to figure out what you'd like. Then you order it at the counter and they give you a buzzer. When your food is ready you bring the buzzer up to the counter and they hand over your food.  The menu had a large selection of different types of kabobs. I went with the tandoori chicken. When it was ready the portion is WAY bigger than you're expecting. It was enough for two meals for me and it was only around $10. Already that was amazing. So what you get is a kabob over a bed of rice. There is also a salad on your plate and tomatoes. We also ordered a side of naan. The chicken was absolutely delicious. It was spicy but just the right amount and very enjoyable. I am not a huge fan of Afghani food, as this was my first time eating it.  I loved the environment of this restaurant as well. It did get super busy while we were in there, and I think they may have had a party going on. There was also outdoor seating.  I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Came to Ontario not knowing Afghans existed. Left knowing that this place made the best Afghan food I've ever had. The kabobs were heavenly. Excellent customer service and ample seating at this location. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and atmosphere. Had the waziri tandori. Was tender and very delicious."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Took take-out and had it within 5 minutes after take-out. Wrap was served cold. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chaplee (beef dish) while my friend ordered the chicken curry. Plates average around 10 to 16 dollars. Comes with rice and salad. Good portion for the price. The Chaplee wasn't spicy as advertised but it was well flavoured and moist.   Try the mango smoothie! Not sugary like most drinks. It was smooth and refreshing."}
{"text":"Walked into this stylish little place with moderate expectations, and was literally PUNCHED IN THE FACE WITH HOW AWESOME THE FOOD WAS!  I am not kidding.  Ordered the Mantu Dumplings appetizer and couldn't believe how good these little buggers were: spiced ground beef in dumplings, covered in a lentil sauce with herb yogurt.  I wanted to lick the plate.  Next we had the Qabuli Palau which is apparently a signature dish.  Nice pilaf of rice with carrots and raisins (I'm not really a guy into sweet stuff with my rice but...)  with small steaks of veal that were so tender I've changed how I feel about veal.  Seriously.  It also came with a tasty chicken curry on the side.  We didn't even eat the spicy wrap we bought, we were too full.  2 thumbs up!  D"}
