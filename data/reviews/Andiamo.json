{"text":"Amazing!

This small restaurant in Montreal had the most charming staff and extremely well cooked seafood. I highly recommend the fish bar. You can select an assortment of fish, mussels, clams, octopus, choosing just a few or a bit of everything. The chef cooks each perfectly then brings out several sauces to complement your options. I have to say, the flavor was so good I didn't add much in the way of sauce. I also didn't add any salt, which for me is unheard of. (I went with my mother who is not a fan of salty foods and she said it was perfectly cooked too, so I promise it's not too salty.)

The server added fresh lemon zest, and was generous in pouring the wine. Not to mention the entire staff was friendly, entertaining, attentive, and welcoming. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was excited about trying Andiamo, but was disappointed. The waitstaff was extremely friendly and the drinks were delicious, but the food was not great. I am from the coast and I suppose I've just had better seafood. I had the fish bar and my boyfriend had the scallops. Everything was salty and much of my fish was overcooked and rubbery. We were only in Montreal a few days and I wish we chose someplace else to experience better food."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was lovely. I had the \"braised endive tatin pie stuffed with fêta over beet caramel\" for an appetizer and it was both delicious and interesting-- the best thing I had in my two-day trip to Montreal. For the entree I had the \"grilled mediterranean sea bass filet, eggplant and zucchini caviar, virgin olive oil with infused with fennel\", which was also very good-- I thought the fish was good (but I'm not at all a fish expert), and the eggplant and zucchini were perfect with it. The desserts were cute, relatively inexpensive, little cups of different things (chocolate panna cotta with caramel is what I chose, but they had about five choices). If you get an appetizer, the \"Table d'hôte\" deal is quite reasonable. All in all, I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Assez abordable. J'ai bien aimé  la salade de pieuvres et le plat de pétoncles au citron et risotto aux champignons. Portions généreuses.

Avant de commander, on nous sert des olives, pain chaud aux herbes (avec beurre et huile), etc...

Bon service..un belle surprise!"}
{"text":"We went here because of the fish buffet but ended up just going ala carte instead.  Vicki had the calamari to start and it was very good.  I had the mixed greens which were also solid.  

For mains, she had the shrimp and chorizo which was more of a salad than a casserole (it wasnt clear on the menu). She liked it but not as much given expectations.  I had the sea bass which was an excellent piece of fish with two delicious polenta cakes.  I was just happy I avoided eating both of them.

They have nice small desserts in a few ounce cups so we both had the strawberry salad which was a nice refresher.  

For wine we had an Italian Pinot Noir that was solid."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, courteous waitstaff, and most importantly, very tasty. Price was great, too: two dinners, two appetizers and a soda for under $60. I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves excellent fish. Fresh, done just right, tasty, beautifully presented! Service was great too, with courteous, fast and attentive waiters."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Montreal.  Great food, nicely presented with professional, friendly service.  Reasonably priced meals."}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because I don't want readers to expect perfection- but we loved our dining experience here. Tons of seafood on the menu, excellent appetizers, and very nice service. Our only complaint is that the wine list does not have an affordable option- nothing under $40. Entrees start at $20 and go up to $40 for their all you can eat fish bar. One friend got the fish bar- you go up and choose from 10 or more fresh selections of seafood and shellfish and they grill or steam your selection and bring it out with the other plates. Sides were delicious and served family style. This is off the beaten path so it wasn't too crowded or loud. The chairs were super comfy. There are lots of cute enjoyable touches like the way they serve bread and dessert- definitely worth dining there if you are looking for great seafood!"}
{"text":"Chef Ferrer is always a sure bet... Food is flavourful. 

The fish is of good quality, but nothing high end is offered on the menu. It's a fish place and they only have very small shrimp, no scallops, no chillean bass... That's the biggest criticism I have about the menu.

I had the fish bar (à volonté)... the sides were excellent!

The high point of this place is the truly exceptionnal service. The staff was very nice.

All in all, I would go back to spend a nice quite evening with my husband."}
{"text":"Bon. J'y suis déjà allé pour le souper et j'avais été plutôt satisfait.

J'y retourne pour un lunch et ouch! Prix très élevés, trop élevés pour ce qu'on a. Je prends la formule du midi, avec le pavé de morue sauce vierge sur légumineuses et c'est certainement santé, mais insipide. Assaisonnement introuvable. La portion est minimale. La bisque de saumon est correcte. 30$ plus boissons, café, taxes et service. Ça fait un lunch cher pour ça. Enfin. J'étais peut-être de mauvais poil."}
{"text":"Try to go there from Wednesday to saturday night for the all you can eat fish bar! Absolutely love the concept! You can personally choose your fish from the counter.  They simply grill it to have the real and fresh flavour of the fish and provide you with lemon.  It is the best way to compare the taste and texture from one fish to another.  The service is also stellar, they know their differences between their fish and the wine list is interesting! A definite go for a seafood and fish lover!"}
