{"text":"Very pleasant experience. Surprised it wasn't more crowded. Their mini cheeseburgers were simply amazing."}
{"text":"Been there many, many times now. The food is consistent, hot and fresh every time. Made to order.

LOVE the strawberry shake. Vanilla Ice cream and strawberries blended together, then topped with whipped cream. What's not to love? Have yet to find a better one in town. 

Plain cheese burger with grilled onions and mushrooms added is a winner and now my favorite. It's like a juicy steak on a bun, only a burger. You get the idea.

What are you waiting for? Give Bing's a try."}
{"text":"Had the beacon burger, was a good burger. They ask you what you want on your burger from there choices on the menu. Fries were different,  unpeeled and a little soft. I would go back, but in not 100% sold on this place. Do sent look like there are many choices,  but is very clean. Took a little long to get my order, but employees were very nice. I would say this is a place that you might like."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying, amazing food here!
The burgers are absolutely incredible!  The fries and rings are real good too. Everything is prepared to order, so you might have to wait a bit but man is it worth it!! 
Bing is super nice and her workers are real pleasant and professional also. My wife and I eat here every Friday or Saturday. I highly recommend this place. I promise you won't be dissapointed.

{"text":"All I can say is after giving up on most take out food, this was the best burger I've had from a restaurant ever!! Hands down the service was great and food delicious. This will be the only place for now on I go for burgers and dogs. And to remarks that they are kinda slow that's because the cook you food fresh and make it with care. Love it thank you."}
{"text":"There are a lot of burger shops these days and most of them taste plastic and fake. This was a nice surprise to actually have a burger that was seasoned by some one who cares and cooked better than I could at home! Well done bings burgers! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Bing's ALWAYS provides a very tasty meal!  My wife and I have definitely put it in our \"restaurant rotation\"  Green chile cheese burger is great, fries are great, too!"}
{"text":"The other day I gave someone a burger from a local diner and it looked so good that I have had a craving for one like ever since.  I didn't want any of the local commercial chain burgers.  I wanted something with fresh meat and condiments that tasted home made and then I got an ad for Bing's Burgers, not to be confused for Bing's Burgers in Cottonwood.  I decided that this looked just like what I was craving.  My wife and I just tried it and it was perfect.  She had a patty melt and agreed that hers was just the way that she liked them too.  Bing the cook makes your way - there are so many things to add to a burger here, but I wanted a classic one like at home.  It does take a little bit longer than any fast food burger but as noted before this one was cooked with lots of care.  I cannot wait to try an authentic Chicago Dog next time with Vienna dogs, green relish and sport peppers."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much obsessed with this place! I'm always on the look out for great mom and pop shops and Bing's is my new favorite. The staff and owner are super friendly and accommodating. The burgers are fantastic and you can tell everything is fresh. I especially love the Teriyaki chicken sandwich. I added grilled onions and fresh jalapeno and it was out of this world good."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!  Great small business with awesome burgers and chicken sandwiches.  Outstanding service.  Support local business and eat a burger here.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"On the way to Sonic... saw Bings and tried it. Excellent fresh-made-to-order burgers! A large fry was more than enough for 2 - fresh & crispy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We come at least once a week.  The food is very fresh and the fries are to die for.   Come on down and support the little guys instead of the big franchise."}
{"text":"Fabulous burgers made fresh to order.  Generous portions.  Friendly staff and clean restaurant.  Love this neighborhood shop!"}
{"text":"The burgers were fresh and awesome! We enjoy our good share of burgers, and this is our go-to joint now. The patty and toppings were so fresh--the lettuce tasted like it came straight from the garden. My husband and I went and appreciated the way you \"build\" your burger, choosing from a list exactly what you'd like on it. I ordered the Green Chile Burger (YUM!) and he ordered the Bing Burger with bacon and the \"Chef's special bacon sauce.\" Good overall selection of toppings and condiments.
It was totally filling and the fries were exactly what I like at a burger joint--thick cut, crispy on the outside and cooked perfectly (no mush).
We also got a chocolate shake which tasted like it was freshly spun from real ice cream. My husband said he didn't want it to end.
Also a very friendly staff and clean place. We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Was on my way to Sonic and decided to try Bing's, I'm glad I did. Excellent cheeseburger with fried egg on top and LOTS of tasty fries. You can custom order for burgers: bacon, cheese variety, fried egg, condiments, toppings, etc. Best burger I've had away from my patio in months, very fresh...and quick. The fries were large cut and crispy. I spent about the same as I would have at Sonic, but the food was much better. Clean restaurant with about 8 tables. The menu board is a little small, but the food is great."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious. Great wings, delicious garlic fries, fresh salad and mouth watering burgers. My family and I ordered up a storm and shared all the great food. Would definitely come back. The staff was friendly and the prices are great. I am visiting from California and wish I was staying longer just so I could come back another 3 times before hopping home. This is a simple looking restaurant that hides a treasure of delicious food. I love finding these hidden gems!!"}
{"text":"Lunched it here today.  Burgers are are good... eh... better than good.  The meat is certainly a couple notches up from say, In & Out.  Which I like.  The bun is high quality as well.  I ordered the Green Chile Burger.  I was very happy with it.  My family both go Cheese burgers and they loved them.  I was surprised by the Fries... they are not up to the standards of the other food.  Bland.  

The service was good and the staff was friendly.  Not sure how long it's been here, but Yelp brought me today.  Constructive criticism?  Slightly up the scheme, change the colors and bring in some more images etc... for the walls.  Up the menu look and feel and brand it!  

Parting shot?  You already have the hard part down... good food!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Overrated. Nothing special. Burgers were average. I prefer this place over the chains."}
{"text":"I was disappointed they were out of the bacon sauce. However, I very much enjoyed the burger. I like how you can add your own toppings. They were generous with the bacon and other toppings.  The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The onion rings were crisp and flavorful, so many times the batter is bland."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries! Their fries actually taste like potatoes. Three of us went there today.  I had the green chile burger.  If you like green chile, this is the burger for you.  There is a list of about 10 different things you can also add to your burger (olives, lettuce, tomato, onions, etc....) . Burgers are huge and lots of fries.  The onions rings are crispy.  We left stuffed.  About $30 for 3 people.  Not bad considering the quality of the food.  Staff is friendly also.  Only negative is that they use Hunts ketchup.  Return factor is 100%"}
{"text":"Excellent new place, great burgers, friendly staff.  I liked the fries, but they were a little on the salty side.  We all liked our burgers.  Good variety of toppings, including a homemade bacon condiment, made with saut√©ed onions and chicken stock.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a mom and pop burger joint not far from my home. Everything is fresh and made to order! The special bacon sauce is pretty epic! The food can take a little longer but you can't rush perfection! Can't wait to return and try their chicken sandwich!"}
{"text":"So you are hungry huh? Thinkin about getting a burger? Maybe some fries with that burger? Want an extra burger for free when you buy 1 burger? Want an egg on that burger? Some cheese on that too? If you answered no to any of those questions, get out of this planet forever.

Ill see you at Bings."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff. Great tasting food. I ordered cheeseburger combo and it might as well have been homemade it was that good. Fries are thick cut real home style fries. Veggies on burger were very fresh. Restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"Quality homemade burger and a generous portion of hand cut fries. Comparable to Five Guys."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here you need to eat here! I am thinking this place is a secret. It's in a strip mall tucked behind the Discount Tire at Warner and Cooper Roads. I highly recommend the burgers and fries here. This good eats place is nothing fancy just a mom and pop burger joint, but my food is always tast. The fries are perfect every time, never greasy. So delicious!  This is one of my Friday lunch hang outs. I don't know of a better burger except off my grill. Why isn't this place packed?"}
{"text":"Good burgers made to order. Love this place,. Always a pleasure to go there. Good food by very nice people"}
{"text":"This is the classic mom and pop burger joint. The burger was delicious and the fries were a perfect match. Fresh meat, freshly made from hand formed patty seasoned well with salt and pepper. This is my husbands new favorite local burger joint. 

*Fries did not have skin on them as other posts mentioned."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast food, this is definitely not it. Our order of 3 burgers took about 15 minutes to get. This was not a big deal to us, but just want to make it clear this isn't a fast food joint (not by my standards, at least).  

The burgers are nice and large, perfectly cooked, and delicious.  Fries were a little too seasoned for me, but I like my fries pretty plain and where I don't have to wipe salt off my fingers after every bite.  This is really the only reason I didn't go with the 5 stars.

The menu is pretty plain. From what I could tell you can either get a hamburger or a hot dog. You can add whatever toppings you'd like to either. However, I didn't spend much time perusing the menu, as we were looking for Burgers to begin with.

If you're going at night, be aware that they have a temporary sign/banner that is covering a neon sign. At night time, you can't read the Bing's Burger sign at all. All you can see is the neon sign underneath which is says Fresh Days. Anyways, just go to the far east side of the complex and it's in the corner suite next to the church. If you take the driveway off of Cooper that goes between Discount Tires and Bahama Bucks, go straight all the way back and you'll run in to it. Don't drive around aimlessly looking for it like someone else on Yelp may or may not have done.  ;)

Definitely worth a stop here."}
{"text":"Good burger, greasy fries.  My wife and I stopped in here the other day for lunch.  We both had the Green Chili Burger and Fries.  The burger was good as were the green chilis and the pepper jack cheese.  There were plenty of fries, but they had no salt and were a bit greasy.  I like my fries a little crunchy and was a little disappointed by the lack of flavor and soft fries.  Over all a nice little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Gilbert! Or anywhere for that matter!  Ask for the secret French fries!"}
{"text":"Kind of suspicious of these reviews. Finally tried this place after such a long time seeing them as the most highly rated place nearby- and we have a LOT of great places to eat nearby. I've never seen a soul near this place and couldn't understand how they have so many positive reviews and are always so empty? But I'm feeling adventurous so we try it even though I was pretty sure these reviews can't be legit.

I was right. There's no way. The place was a ghost town...a clean, cheerfully painted ghost town. I've never eaten in a completely empty restaurant before- I hope I never do again. Awkward.

The food was just ok. Nothing I can imagine anyone would give five stars to...it's not BAD...but really it wasn't good either.

The service was excellent and the place was clean and efficient...but I'm really about the food and the food here isn't really great. From now on I'll stick to my Yelp instincts and avoid suspiciously rated places like this."}
{"text":"Great fresh juicy burger with every imaginable  topping.  French fries hot, and crunchy on outside and creamy inside.  Everything was perfect!!  Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the egg, bacon cheese burger. Very tasty. The tomatoes and lettuce were fresh and the burger was delicious. My wife had the Chicago dog and loved it. We split a basket of fries and they were great as well. Think crispy In-N-Out style fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"Should have paid more attention to the negative reviews on here and stayed away!  Way over priced! My husband had a single 1/4 lb with cheese, bacon, mayo, lettuce and tomato; order of onion rings and a chocolate shake. I had the 1/4 lb combo with cheese, tomato and lettuce; onion rings and a Coke.  The patties were thin and tasteless, the tomatoes were not ripe at all and the bun was smashed. The onion rings were fried hard, Sonic has way better! 
The grand total with tax was $29.56!! His shake was $4.99. I thought the cashier rang us up incorrectly, nope! We get two 6 oz sirloin STEAK dinners at Texas Roadhouse for $22! Or go to Zinburger for a great $10 burger. I don't  see how this place stays open; Saturday night at 7:30 and only 4 other people in the entire restaurant. Must be because they are do overpriced. We usually support locally owned restaurants but this is one that needs to close. Sorry."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff with a clean environment. Food is cooked to order and not sitting under a lamp. Lots of choices for food. I went with a cheeseburger add bacon....SO MUCH FLAVOR. Do yourselves a favor and try this place."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night, it was just 3 of us. The place was dead but it took almost 30 minutes to get 3 burger combo meals. A group that orders after us actually got their food first. The burgers were a little over cooked but had good flavor. We all got cheese fries, which the actual fries were good, but the cheese tasted like cheap canned nacho cheese. Unfortunately we would probably not go back."}
{"text":"Have not been here for a few months so we decided to give it a go.  We ordered two burgers, a BLT, fries and a coke.  I asked about coupons and I was told that with the coupon, if you ordered a burger, fries and a shake, the second burger was free.  We added a shake onto our order and the girl rang us up.  $34.59. OMG!  I asked about the discount and I was told by the order that, \"I'm paying for quality.\"  Never did get the discount.

I'm more disappointed about the discount.  Why offer a coupon if you won't honor it?  Mike's Burgers, 1 mile away, offers the same quality of food as Bing's Burgers with a greater selection, and will honor a coupon whether you have it or not.  They understand that in the end, it's all about keeping the customer happy so they will continue to return.

I will not eat here again.  They are overpriced and while the food is good, it's not exceptional and not worth a premium price.  It's still just a burger."}
{"text":"Just paid $30 for 3 burger meals at this place. It was DEAD on a Saturday at lunch, should have known what to expect... Cool, greasy, limpy fries, decent burgers, and a less than friendly employee. We won't be going back:("}
{"text":"Bing has the best burgers in all of AZ!!! High quality fresh made burgers with the perfect combination of spices!  Highly recommend the bacon sauce!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this restaurant for 10 years since Blimpie closed. I had zero idea that this burger restaurant had opened. I decided to search on Yelp for anything that might be new in the Ray Cooper area. I saw this with many positive recommendations and stopped in. I ordered two burgers, fries and onion rings. The lady (Owner) was nice and the food was prompt, fresh and good. Place appears to be very clean. My wife and I ate at home and we were both pleased. I will return and I highly recommend this location for a meal. I even received a free ice cream for spending over $8.00 I think it's still a best kept secret. The one thing this place needs is more cars in the parking lot."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Mom n pop burger shop. Staff was very respectful. I got the cheese burger combo. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Soooo I would have given them 5 stars if the place was easier to locate, better signage, better service...but then again if all of those things were perfect, there would be a line to get food...so whatever. 

It's a mom and pop shop with burgers and fries. Eat here if that is what you want. The burger was fresh and tasty.  Nothing incredibly special."}
{"text":"Very good and the portions are big. clean and friendly. Reasonable price for homemade burgers and fries. fresh ingredients. will return. my kids loved it."}
{"text":"The burger was very tasty and the onion rings were ok. They forgot the jalapenos in my burger. The menu said they had natural hamburger but when I asked if it was grass fed beef she said no. The bathroom was in need of professional cleaning. The building in general needed some touch up maintenance."}
{"text":"The real deal in cheeseburgers, fries and onion rings. Real food- if you love great burgers you're going to love Bings"}
{"text":"awesome burger and wings 
a must try 
I'm super happy
get exactly what you want 
price is on point too 
you will be pleasantly surprised"}
{"text":"Good place. I had the bacon cheeseburger with bacon.  Ordered the onion rings instead of the fries and that was the right choice. Nice staff. Burgers were good quality and they deep fry the bacon so it is delicious and crispy."}
{"text":"Went at 11AM Monday. The place is really clean. Was able to pick something out of the menu within a few seconds. Got the green chili burger with onions,lettuce and mayo. Took it to go. 

The burger looks homemade and was a good portion of meat to bun ratio. 
The burger itself was really good. It was flavorful, green chili really popped and accompanied the lettuce and onions. Felt nothing like a burger from a chain joint which I liked. The fries were different, they reminded me of a hybrid between onion straws and mcdonald fries. The fries were half crispy and half normal. It also retained skin which gave it a darker appearance. I rated 4 because of the fries being too crispy and dark. The burger, quality, level of service, and taste was a 5."}
{"text":"Been here twice now.  Super friendly service, and the burgers are amazing!!!!  My favorite is the bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg.  Delicious! I will certainly be visiting more often for the lunch."}
{"text":"C was done with rehearsal and wanted a burger. I quickly checked Yelp and found this place.  It was 11:30 on a Saturday and the place was empty. The entire time we were there 2 separate people came in and picked up food to-go. 
The place was clean I will say that. But the negatives are just overwhelming.

I want to say that when I visit places like this I am simply amazed. It takes guts and money to open and run a restaurant. Why, why do it if you're not going to do the best you can? Why waste your time? Why not do something else that will make you happy? This business is TOUGH. Doing just an OK job is not worth the time. And please understand, I love mom and pop joints. I respect them and frequent them as much as I can. I've been in and around the hospitality business since 1980 when I opened my own catering business while going to ASU.
I'm here trying to instill good values on my son C and help him understand that yes, he can do whatever he wants when he gets older, BUT, whatever he chooses to do, he has to give it his all. No \"half in, half out\" attitude. 

There was one lady working when we got there. By the time we left another young girl showed up but other than saying \"good bye\" we had no interaction with her. Do you see the pic of this place with the little kid looking to the side and no one in the place? That's how it is. A Saturday lunch time and NO ONE sat there but C and I.

C ordered the Kids Cheeseburger ($5.49). The patty was overcooked. Plus the patty was this tiny little thing that looked completely silly sitting on the bun. The fries? Straight out of the freezer. Institutional bagged frozen fries. Really? How hard is it to prep potatoes? Cut em, wash em, par cook em, freeze em, fry em to order. Well, this is what you do when you CARE about the product you're selling. As I said above. Why do this if you're not going to give it your best? Also, with the kids meal comes a cookie. Ah, well that's what the menu said. What C got was a BlowPop. Again, how hard is it to buy a tub of Toll House dough and bake some cookies every day? This meal should have been $2.99 and that's being generous.

I ordered the Cheeseburger Combo ($9.59). Wow, where to start. The patty had way to much black pepper applied. Salt level was fine. The temp was OK. The bun was nothing special as well. I've already commented on the fries. All in all this combo should have been $5.99 if that.

Also, the lady that rang up our order also cooked it. We were sitting at our table so I didn't get to see if she washed her hands after handling my money but I hope so. I would also like to add that while we were there and as we left, C kept asking me why someone would sell such lousy food? 

Clean facility. Lousy Kids meal. Below average Cheeseburger. Lousy Fries. Prices way to high for what you get. 1 Star."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try since I had an appointment nearby a little later. I was a little leery when I walked in because the place was empty. I ordered a double cheese burger combo and it came to a little more than $11.  The place was clean and the staff was friendly and attentive.  The burger is made to order, so you'll tell them which toppings and condiments you want. The food was served fast, but I would hope so since I was the only one here. The burger was hot and juicy, but it tasted as though the cook was heavy-handed with the pepper.  It didn't ruin it, but it was a little more than I prefer.  The fries were hot and crispy, just the way I like them. Overall, it was a good experience and I would come here again."}
{"text":"Nice people.  

$10.50 for double burger, fries and soda.  Food was meh...nothing special.  

This place ended up on a list of 10 best burger places in the valley.  I've now been to two of the places on that list.  Both were meh.  So either the list (I believe it was in the Republic) is wildly wrong or the state of burger restaurants in the valley is pretty sad."}
