{"text":"It's an average pizza joint. Nothing spectacular. Nothing horrible.  Decent option in this small town for pickup or delivery."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious !!!! We didn't take the specials - but made our own. Didn't like that the goat cheese, and chicken equaled 2 toppings but it was still highly worth it. Very yummy"}
{"text":"So I found myself up in Beeton recently to do a job, details not important here, suffice to say I worked up a hearty appetite by the time the colorful storefront caught my eye from the main road across the way.   Quality slices here with generous toppings, they even got pulled pork. Total came out to $10 total for 2 slices + 2 cans a pop, second slice was a meat lovers.  I felt full and refreshed by the time I got back to doin what I was doin up in Beeton...none of your business what I was doin up there anyway, we're talkin pizza here m'kay."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Regardless of the fact that this place is a 5 minute walk from my house, I've grown to love New Orleans Pizza. I ordered from here many times in the last month and continue to be satisfied after each order. All my friends rave with me in agreement about its tastiness. We usually order an extra large meat lovers, feeding about 6 comfortably. It comes to $22.59 taxes in, making me a very happy camper. They aren't light on the toppings and my best guess would say a regular order of cheese is a double order elsewhere. They aren't skimpy on the meat either.  As long as New Orleans Pizza is in business, I'll keep ordering!"}
