{"text":"I didn't feel like this place lived up to the expectations. I was more excited to come here but was let down. It took them too long to serve us our apps and mains. Our apps took about half an hour while our mains took about an hour to come. People came in, ate and left before we even got our food. The food itself was okay. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles - the chicken was way too fatty and the waffles just tasted, odd. Let's just say I've had better southern food."}
{"text":"The decor is outstanding.  The bourbon sour tasted like it had a coconut base.  Not very appealing.  The $5.00 at 5 appetizers were okay.  Not great.  The sevice was so inattentive that we decided not to order main courses and went to another restaurant for dinner.  I really was hoping for a better experience.  Roux is kind of expensive too."}
{"text":"Went to Roux for New Years Eve, where they had a four course prix-fixe menu for the dinner service.  For the mains, my wife had a potato cannelloni and I had beef tenderloin with crab fritter.  Both were excellent.  Despite the place being completely full, the kitchen seemed completely in control, and the wait staff were very attentive.  We have visited his neighbourhood eatery many times, and particularly enjoy their \"happy hour\" menu where they have drinks and dishes available for $5."}
{"text":"Fab food and great vibes definitely going to try the brinch. We were lucky enough to find a table as we went early the place filled up so next time will make reservations"}
{"text":"I was there for Saturday brunch with four others at our table. It was not very busy, and there were two servers on duty. Wish I could have been more positive, but like the Junction Eatery before it, Roux falls down in its service and ill-trained staff. Four out of five dishes arrived fifteen minutes before my sister got her food, with no explanation or apologies from the servers. We had a child with us who ordered the granola & yoghurt, which came in a very tall tippy glass, so we asked for a dish to go under it to catch the spills . The dish she brought was about half an inch wider than the glass, so useless for the purpose. One table would get coffee refills, but then the server would return without checking on the other tables. I ordered the brisket hash and couldn't remember if it rested on potatoes, or some other veggie. Neither could my server. The french toast was a disappointment, as was the bisquit (bit stale), but the croissant was delicious and the pulled pork benedict and the cheesy grits were excellent. Mixed feelings, but will probably try again."}
{"text":"Food is bad. Service is sub-par. Arrived at 1:15pm for a reservation. The restaurant is small and the ambiance was pleasant. We ordered our food pretty quickly but didn't get it until 2:25pm. There was only one other table of 8 who have not received their food at the time we ordered and a total of two other tables that had already received their food. 4 tables total in the entire restaurant. There were two cooks in the kitchen. It shouldn't take one hour to serve two tables brunch food. We're talking eggs, burgers, fried chicken. It was clear where the kitchen messed up. A single patron walked in after we ordered and he ordered, got his food, finished it and paid the bill within 45 minutes. We still had to wait for our food for another 10 mins after this guy left the restaurant. Same thing happened with another couple that sat at the bar. They came after this one patron and also paid their bill before we even got our food. Not once did the waitress come check on us. Food finally arrives, and waitress misunderstood one order so that one had to be redone.  The food was bad. I like my fries salty. When I mean salty, I don't even need to taste one and I will always add salt to my fries. The fries that came though we're even waaaaayyy too salty for me. I felt so bad for the rest of my group who like their fries normally salted. It was like bathing your tongue in a pile of salt. Inedible. Did the waitress come check up on us? Nope! The scone that was served to me was crispy and burnt. The waffles were also burnt. Maybe because the cook was too busy trying to hide in a blind spot to eat instead of pay attention to the waffle maker. It's really unfortunate because I like the decor of this restaurant and its in a good neighbourhood. Unfortunately, they don't take their food seriously and the staff lacks any skill or professionalism. When the restaurant has an open kitchen with a mirror on one side of the wall so that guests can see all the action going on, the cooking staff needs to stay professional and clean. When I caught sight of one cook eating away and not washing his hands after only to continue prepping, I wasn't super disgusted like most people would be, but it was a clear sign that this restaurant has no intention to maintain proper kitchen etiquette. I did not tell the rest of my party what I saw because they were already angry enough at the wait time.  rate 1 star. Give me fries that are edible and I might bump up to two stars."}
{"text":"We've eaten here maybe 10 times now. Great brunch and try the oysters when they have them. Most dished are done with a Cajun flair. Definitely a top notch neighbourhood restaurant. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Celebrated my sons birthday here, food and service was excellent. Jambalaya, flat iron steak and yardbird with waffles all superb. Started things off with oysters, and southern trio was also great. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just don't. Seriously. Don't. But, really. Don't.   Service was sub-par, and that's being generous.   ???"}
{"text":"I have had brunch there twice and ate every morsel on my plate both times. This last weekend I had the pulled pork eggs bennie... ridiculously delicious.  When our server came to ask how we were doing, I was speechless, in a state of bliss eating my unbelievably yummy meal!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to patronizing Roux, hoping it would be our new local go-to.  Not off to a great start as the table service was very slow: 20 minutes to get our drinks, 40 minutes for food and 45 minutes for cutlery to eat said food. We had heard their chicken and waffles were good, and were excited to give them a try.  Sadly, the waffles were over-cooked; the chicken had broken bones and no meat, just gristle. The cheddar grits were under cooked and the apple and cashew salad had no cashews and the apple was mushy and flavorless..  As a final insult, the chicken and waffles, which were left untouched, remained on the bill. Overall a disappointing brunch experience, we certainly won't be returning for any of their meal services."}
{"text":"Brisket hash for brunch!  New name and new industrial decor.  Same great brunch!  My favorite breakfast in the city.  Will have to go back and try out the new oyster menu.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at Roux since it donned the name. I've been in previously since the renovation but only for drinks    The new decor/atmosphere feels more casual yet also more upscale than before. It isn't just the room that's had a makeover; the waitstaff, while never subpar, are well dressed, polite and very professional.   The only thing that hasn't changed is the quality of the menu.   The food here has always been top quality. Derrick (owner and chef) has always provided specialty food and delicious dinners for a reasonable price with a generous portion.   Tonight was no surprise.   I ordered the Flatiron Steak. I usually like my steaks rare, however our waiter recommended I try this particular steak medium-rare because it's thinner than most and might be chewy at rare. I took his advice and was quite pleased in the end. It was exceptionally tender and served on a bed of spinach.   I have to apologise. I hadn't used yelp in quite some time and this review was unpublished. This review is approximately 1.5 years old as of now."}
{"text":"Came by to sample the food, but impressed with what they did with the decor. This new bar looks interesting, and will write a more detailed review in the coming weeks."}
{"text":"Great, yummy, sublime, top of the line food. Nice quaint space with nice touches. Definitely a must go if visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Here for brunch a couple weekends ago. Having worked in the restaurant industry for years, I can tell right off the bat when a restaurant is set up badly for the servers. This is one of them. Mind you, they were trying. Atleast one of them. Our server who seemed to be newer did a great job with us-the other larger woman stood behind the counter talking loudly while ours was running around. Our server was unable to answer some of our questions about the food. This place has a kitchen that allows you to look right in- reassuring to see the cooks making our dishes with care. The food was outstanding which is what will bring us back in the end. Highly recommend the Chicken and Waffles."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some oysters and clam chowder with a couple friends, service and atmosphere were great, prices were reasonable especially considering the quality of food. Will definitely come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I'm a long time resident of the neighbourhood and my wife and I are long-time dedicated customers of Derrick's, from the time he opened Junction Eatery, the predecessor to Roux.  I am easily found on Flickr (rhh), and my blog is easily found as well (see my profile for the link) - so too is the website for my law practice. I've posted dozens of pictures of the food at Junction Eatery and am now working my way through the Roux menu as well. And on my blog I've written extensively about Derrick's food.  We are huge fans. We're committed fans of several other restaurants in our neighbourhood, too. The Junction has seen a marvellous renaissance in the last 5-10 years and our community feels a lot of gratitude to the restauranteurs and other business people who have gambled on us. We feel a lot of loyalty to Derrick, his partner, and his staff - but we wouldn't if they didn't earn our patronage every time we go.  I've said it several times - Derrick has one of the best burgers in Toronto. His huevos rancheros are outstanding - it's one of my favourite breakfasts in Toronto. He has a well-practiced and creative eye for the plate. And he has southern and french food down pat. The po-boy is by any reasonable standard, an insanely delicious sandwich. Last, the value for your dollar at Roux is just outstanding - your buck goes a lot farther here than at many other better known places.  As I said, I am easily found on the web. If you want specifics, please contact me directly - I'm happy to tell you more."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with a reservation. Service was horrendous. If you can't handle a full restaurant on a Saturday night, just close the doors now there is no point is trying. It took 30 minutes and asking 3 times to get a glass of water. Both tables on either side were literally monitoring when a waiting came with water so they could all get some before he disappeared again. Bad service is tolerable if the food is great, but food was adequate at best. With great restaurants like playa cabana and Nodo less than 2 min away handling packed houses every night, there is no excuse for bad service on a Saturday night. With better options in the area, will not return"}
{"text":"I love the decor,  the music,  and the oyster bar! Friendly staff,  amazing chef and really good food. My favourite is the Junction Burger made fresh as well as the brunch options."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I went out to dinner last night at Roux. We're both big fans of southern food, and since we also live in the Junction, we were pretty excited about it.  The service was ok, it took a long time to get even a greeting from our server. The table next to us was seated 20 minutes after we were and we all finished our meals at the same time, if that gives you an impression. However, they couldn't have been more concerned or gracious when I had to send back my meal.  I don't generally send back meals. I usually just eat it and never go back, But this was inedible. I ordered the fried chicken with rustic mash and spicy slaw. The slaw was ok. The \"rustic\" mash was peeled white potatos that were boiled then half-ass mashed with big hard chunks in them. They were not seasoned. Just potatoes.  The chicken was the reason I had to send it back. I'm a big fried chicken girl, and never in my life have I had anything as fatty as that. The meat was two thighs and a drumstick, which are interesting choices for a $16 meal. There was nearly no meat to be found, and what was there was surrounded by globs of fat. It was gross. The breading was very sweet too, which I found strange.   My server came back to the table and suggested that I order something else, because the chef said it was all that fatty. So I got the mussels. They were ok."}
{"text":"Love this new spot! Very small, intimate interior with great food. Go in Tues-Friday from 5pm to 7pm for their $5 at 5 deals. Great oysters and mussels at reasonable prices and mill street beer on tap. Gluten-free friendly!"}
{"text":"You can tell food is prepared with the best and freshest ingredients! Great atmosphere, interesting menu!"}
{"text":"Well pretty average southern fare here, backed up with HIGH prices, not a great combo. Fresh oysters were great, but that only require proper refrigeration.  The colossus caesar with a sausage and fritter on top was a bit a of showstopper, but sadly the fritter was underseasoned and not quite cooked through.  Fried chicken was crunchy, but again underseasoned and JUST cooked.  Dishes have hope here, but simple mistakes with seasoning and rushed cooking are not really acceptable at these prices.  We found services was average, despite other review. I'm guessing the owner has taken his eye off the kitchen and it shows.  3 stars as this fare is not common in Toronto. In the south this place would get 2 stars."}
{"text":"Our first experience at Roux was excellent. Unfortunately the next and last time was terrible. We had to wait for an hour for our starters. Our server finally told us 50 minutes into the wait that the kitchen had made a mistake. When our starters arrived they looked rushed, with poor presentation and nothing like we had previously (it was the same dish). Our main course took another 40 minutes and by this time, we were just ready to leave. We asked for a discount on the food and were told by the manager that the policy prohibits her from offering a discount. After 10 minutes of explaining our discontent, the manager and the servers seemed like they did not care that we were unhappy. After such a bad experience, we will not return."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, when it was the Junction Eatery and Roux.  Derrick is a master in the kitchen and I've never been disappointed in any meal there.   If you're there for brunch, get the waffles. You will not be disappointed! And his Huevos Rancheros? SO MUCH BETTER THAN Cool Hand of a Girl's."}
{"text":"I wish zero stars was an option. I came for brunch on Saturday with a group of 6.The restaurant is small to begin with and it wasn't busy, so there was no reason that we had to wait almost an hour for our food. We also didn't get our food until we followed up with our server and when we received it, it was lukewarm. So was the food ready but she just didn't know? But then why didn't the kitchen staff say anything? I ordered the pulled pork grilled cheese and you could literally kill someone with the toast. It was ROCK HARD. My friend also tasted like old fries that were refried to be reheated. The waitress missed one of my friend's orders so she had to wait even longer to receiver her food, and this is after there was a gap between the first 3 dishes served and the next 2. When we asked for the bill, the added 18% gratuity. That didn't sit well with me so I went to speak with the manager. It was almost as if she saw it coming because she was quick to say she would remove it. I don't even think she apologized and neither did the server. Worst dining experience ever. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the brunch here, haven't tried dinner yet but am very interested.  Staff are friendly and food is delicious.  Try the pulled pork eggs Benny or brisket hash and eggs and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst service I have ever received.  Took 20 min to get 2 drinks.  The service was horrible.  Food was sitting out for 10 minutes before being served.  Front end service was terrible!!!! Heard the manager complain to another employee about a customer.  The bartender stopped making my drink to attend to another customer who was waiting for water for about 20 minutes !!! If you value your time stay clear from this place !  Stay far far far away from this place!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Roux twice now, and can say quite confidently that I have enjoyed the oysters, food and beverages both times.  My most recent venture there was for brunch. I had the eggs and brisket hash, and my sister had the frittata. Both meals were beautifully prepared, arrived quickly, and were consumed to an embarrassingly plate-licking degree :)  My previous experience there for dinner was in a group with a vegan who had additional dietary restrictions. Seeing predominantly meat-based offerings, and feeling sentenced to ordering yet another restaurant salad, he inquired with our server as to whether his particular limitations could be accommodated. The chef made him a custom vegan plate (not on the menu) that featured 10 different types of vegetables, all prepared in unique and deliciously-spiced ways, and only charged $14 for it!  Beyond this, the cocktail list is short but well-curated, and the overall pricing for the food and beverages is quite reasonable (it's cheaper than Indie Ale House, that's for sure!)  I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped into Roux for the first time last night for a snack and was really disappointed. Had the \"Roux platter\" that consisted of dry rubbed ribs, smoked chicken and andouille sausage. Everything tasted like smoke and dryness and nothing, if that makes sense. You'd get it if you had the dish - but I wouldn't recommend it. All I wanted to eat was the mashed potato side but there was zero seasoning in those too - not a damn grain of salt to be found. And I'm the kind of person who complains/is probably too sensitive about over-salted dishes.  Unfortunate; was really looking forward to trying this place since moving into the area. Will give them one more shot for the fried chicken and hope this was just an off night."}
{"text":"My mother and I had a great brunch here the other weekend and will definitely be coming back for more! Great price point compared to Toronto standards, the service was friendly and not pushy in any way and, more importantly, the food was exactly what you'd hope for when you come in hungry for brunch. The chicken and waffles was especially worth eating again!"}
{"text":"Interesting fresh take on southern french food. Great service and cocktails. Have visited 5+ times. Beautiful ambiance, delicious small meals and perfect for a date or out for a casual lunch. Lively but moody. A must visit. Oyster bar is a must see."}
{"text":"Met friends for dinner here last night - restaurant was busy and we were glad we had a reservation.  Our drink orders were taken immediately and we should have clued in when the server wanted our dinner order immediately.  After ordering, we waited 75 minuted for our entrees to be served - and we had to ask for them!  Our attentive server disappeared!  When the entrees were served, my much anticipated pork chop was lukewarm, the veg was lukewarm and the jalapeno cornbread was too dry to be edible - no butter to be seen.  My husband's fried chicken was hot and tasty, but the grits were undercooked and very toothy.  Our friends ordered the fried chicken as well and  the jamabalya  and were happy with their orders.  Again, no attention from the server so I ate my disappointing dinner.  When the server came to clear the plates, and we did complain, they stepped up with a round of free drinks and removed my entree from the bill.   There are other restaurants that serve similar food - I will go there instead of coming back to Roux - very disappointed"}
{"text":"We had an AMAZING dinner here for my birthday last night. I would highly recommend Roux for dinner!  We were a party of seven that was initially six. (One thing I will note is that when I called to change our reservation, they didn't pick up the phone or call me back. However, they sat us right away even though we were early and just looking to have a drink at the bar, and accommodated our seventh person, so it wasn't a problem.) The floorspace is small, but they fit us in, and we definitely didn't feel cramped.  The service was awesome. Everyone we spoke to was polite and friendly.  The food and drinks were also phenomenal. I had the house cabernet and a lot of my friends had the house chardonnay, and both were excellent table wines; some people had the Mill St. Organic on tap and mentioned to me that it was amazing. Our water glasses were never empty and we got our drinks about as quickly as possible every time.  I can't speak to the oysters myself, but my friends who like them said they were great. I did try the goat cheese popover, and it was excellent. A friend got the sliders and loved them, and another got the ceviche and said it was great.  We were warned that the food wouldn't come out quickly, but since we were a larger party we'd expected that, and while it wasn't fast, we didn't feel like we waited a really long time either. For my part, the chicken and waffles were AMAZING - the chicken was fresh out of the fryer and perfectly seasoned, the waffles were light and fluffy, and the bourbon syrup with berries was unbelievably food (and not very bourbon-y, which I appreciated - it's more a hint of flavour). I tried the catfish, which was lovely, and the steak, which was amazing too.  For dessert, they had coffee chocolate cheesecake, which had the most amazing chocolate crumble crust I've ever tasted.  We loved Roux and we'll definitely be back! They have a happy hour from 4-7 with $5 \"apps and taps\" - I don't think it's every day, but it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Better than expected! Eggs Benny surprisingly light with an interesting hollandaise sauce that was really good."}
{"text":"A group of 6 came here for brunch and it took almost an hour for us to get our food. The restaurant wasn't even busy either and when our food came, it was only luke warm and they forgot one of our orders. Our friend who didnt receive her food had to wait another 15 mins. Terrible service and terrible food overall. The salmon popover that I ordered was super dry and flavourless. They even had the audacity to add an 18% auto gratuity to our table. At least the manager removed that after we flagged it to her. I would never go back here or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Food took well over an hour to arrive - were told that it would be a delay because so busy.  Were brought some white bread slices (Wonder bread) with oil and vinegar 45 mins in. Portions were tiny (2 small pieces of candied pecans in kale salad), 2 tablespoons of creme brule for desert, about 3 tablespoons of rice with the Jambalaya."}
{"text":"Roux is probably a bit better than three stars, but the service needs help to get there. In the wide-open race for \"Best Restaurant in the Junction\", Roux does well enough to enter the race, but not enough to separate from others, such as The Hole in the Wall that has (very surprisingly) similarly priced and possibly better food. Here are a few notes from my experience.  1. The Mac n Cheese is much bally-hooed, but really just penne pasta in a cream sauce. If you must, order the 5$ side and not the 15$ meal. 2. The scallops were good. However, the \"creamy\" grits were as coarse and chunky as any grits i have ever had. Also, the dish had unpitted olives. munch with caution. 3. The service is below average. Like many small restaurants, they are probably working with a small staff. However, if you are paying 50$ for a meal, you should be able to get water refills or general acknowledgement without being a young female. 4. The bar seats are uncomfortable. Half overlook the kitchen, while the rest overlook the bar. 5. There is usually one specialty cocktail. otherwise, beer, wine, and two mix drinks (gin and tonic, etc) are the alcohol options. The wine list is limited. The white wine list features wines clustered in a narrow price range -37-48$.  in conclusion, you can have a decent meal here, but don't expect to be blown away. Service doesn't deliver the experience that invites a quick return."}
{"text":"Four of us went for Saturday brunch. Service was extraordinarily slow - particularly when you consider that it seats about 20 and three were cooking (45 - 60 min). Great food would have been a good compensation. This was not the case. It was just OK.   I had chicken and waffles. Waffles were hard and small. Why skimp on waffles? Chicken was a partially deboned wing and a small leg. Nothing else on the plate. Flavour was passible. Left hungry - after brunch?  The others fared a bit better saying their meals were - OK to good. In ordering, a special request was completely missed. Replacement meal was, however, prepared quickly.  Honestly, the best thing was the ambiance.   I will not return."}
{"text":"Roux is bad in so many ways. It's actually embarrassing. I wish I had read the other reviews before tonight as I would have avoided it. I'm not going to get into too many details as I don't want to relive the experience. Suffice to say that our party of 8 tonight suffered through an excruciating dinner. Extremely slow service - drinks took anywhere from 15-30 minutes to arrive after being ordered. Food was similarly slow to hit the table. The sporadic times that the server came by to check on us she was often in a state of shock because she clearly forgot that we had actually ordered food and drinks and then dash off to either check on it or to finally ring in the order.  Eventually the food did come, but I wish it hadn't. I don't understand how a restaurant can serve food that comes out lukewarm or cold, yet looks like it was under a heat lamp all night. Dry as hell, yet cold. Mind-boggling. On top of that, the only taste profile is SALTY.   I'd like to say this similarly salty review is due to excess sodium from our meal. Unfortunately it's just the result of bad food, bad service, and an overall bad night as a result."}
{"text":"Seeing the other reviews on here are very surprising to me. I've been to Roux five times now, twice for dinner, three times for lunch. meals have taken a reasonable amount of time, no longer than one should expect a meal to take. Staff has been very attentive. And the food has been EXCELLENT. Delicious, very rich, and always juicy. I've had an excellent Boston Blue fish n chips, as well as their pan fried catfish. And their brunch hash is absolutely amazing, very flavourful, loaded with coriander and cooked perfectly.  I honestly have yet to have a bad experience here. The one thing that wasn't to my taste was their bran waffles with their fried chicken, but boy was the chicken delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 1 star because the food was the only decent thing about the whole experience. We went here last month and the service was awful ! I arrived before my friends and asked for a table and the lady who did not so much greet me told me it was a 45 minute wait or I could sit outside. So I said okay I'll go outside and then she said alright and walked away (I thought she was going to grab menus and lead me outside) but she went to go serve a table.   I sat outside for 10 minutes and no one came out to see if I needed anything or if any other guests had arrived. After my friends had arrived (going on 20 minutes) a guy came out twice to check on other tables (even passed ours and said nothing). In all fairness he may have thought we had been served, but no menus or drinks on the table should have been a clue ? After 30 minutes when we really should have left we flagged him down and he apologized and said he would go grab the server.  Of course our server was the lady who told me I could sit outside and walked away. We ordered drinks and had to wait to order food because she finally brought menus at this point. After that it went more downhill, along with another 25 minute wait for our food, it all came at different times so we couldn't even enjoy our meal together. Also one of the sides I had personally ordered just never came!  At this point we had been there for an hour and a half and we had to go inside to ask for the bill. There was only about 6 people in the restaurant at this time and it would have been nice to be told that there was inside seating available after asking for it in the first place. Moral of the story there is great places in the city with southern food with fabulous service. Sadly this place does not offer both and not being able to support a local business really sucks."}
{"text":"Made a reservation here a couple of weeks ago for two people. My friend really wanted to join so we thought we could go and wait for a table to open for 3. We would have been open to waiting as the menu looked great. However, the server who was working that night didn't even give us that option. She simply turned to us and said \"yeah that's not going to work.\" No apologies or anything, not even an offer for us to wait around for a while.   We were really upset by this and asked where else in the area we could go, she answered \"no idea\" and walked away. We ended up going to indie ale house and had a phenomenal experience. It was packed with a line up but we were given the option to wait! What a difference good service can make."}
{"text":"We dropped into Roux for brunch on the long weekend.  I was totally expecting it to be packed and a line out the door but it was relatively quiet with only one other table of patrons.  They didn't have a high chair for the little one which was fine as we just kept her in the stroller.  Brunch menu looked fantastic so we went with the poached eggs on hash ($11) and the pulled pork quesadilla ($10).  The eggs didn't come with toast or any sides so I also ordered a croissant ($3).  They have some great local brews on tap so we went with Junction Brewery's Conductor's Ale ($6).  The eggs and hash were coated in this fantastic mushroom gravy.  Just yum.  And I was surprised by the pork in the quesadilla.  It had a really nice smokey flavour to it and wasn't just dosed in a super sweet BBQ sauce.    Service was friendly and love the decor of Roux, especially the cool bar seats.  Will be back for another brunch/dinner/drinks.  This new-ish Junction restaurant is a bit East of Junction proper (aka East of Keele on Dundas) so maybe that's why the hoards haven't descended on it yet."}
{"text":"Firstly I have no idea how a restaurant named Roux doesn't appear to use Roux to construct its Gumbo. They could, in fact, but if so it's so uncharacteristically thin, I would not call it Gumbo.  In addition to a very material amount of the volume of the Gumbo consisting of inedible bone, it was one of the blandest soups I've had in my life and I'm including Campbell soup cans. I did not grow up pampered, so I'm not fancy. But oh, boy. The Gumbo I made on my first attempt was at least 3X better. I truly didn't want to finish it, but I had no other food in the house and had little food all day.  The collard greens were again bland and over-salted and under-cooked.  Roux killed the baby Jesus.  0 Stars for food, but 3 stars for very friendly, lively, attentive and competent staff. Not sure about the other reviews but the people I talked to on my delivery order were a pleasure to talk to."}
{"text":"Went back to Roux to take friends who never tried their chicken and waffles which are delicious.  Apps came very quick and quite the abundance only if you order the items that are on the slab. Otherwise I have found that their apps are quite small to share :(  The main course came and did not fail delicious and quite the abundance of food Drinks are extremely overpriced and VERY water downed. I ordered a cocktail that cost 11 and literally came in a shot glass was very disappointed with the drinks last night. It wasn't just mine it was for the rest of my guests. All of us got water downed drinks and in very small glasses."}
{"text":"You always here about how tough the restaurant industry is. At least 1/3 make it and there are many reasons why they fail...this place fails for all the right reasons. Ambiance - fail. Food quality - fail. Say no more!"}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic brunch at roux!! Awesome decor and friendly causal service!  So many great options on the menu will be back soon!"}
