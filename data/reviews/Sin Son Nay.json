{"text":"\"I haven't been this excited to be on Van Buren since I moved here in 2001,\" I told Terry T as we were approaching Sin Son Nay on Easter Sunday. 

We stopped by to visit a couple earlier that afternoon and the husband mentioned this place and their fantastic goat meat. Well, I love goat. And being Easter, there weren't a plethora of places readily available so we decided to give it a shot. Huge reward.

It's a blink-and-you-miss-it location, although the setting sun and unfamiliar location possibly contributed to that. Walking in took me back to a taqueria I ate at in Nogales: an enclosed carport-type structure with asphalt and concrete floors, simple tables, and neutral d√©cor outside the hand painted seafood on the walls. But the highlight of this place are the tacos (at least that's what we ate). The berria and cabeza tacos--I ordered two of each--were moist, flavorful and perfectly seasoned. Terry ordered a side of rice and beans, both of which were terrific...especially the refried beans. I think they used lard in them, I HOPE they used lard in them. I really like lard.

Additional menu items I'd like to try are their ceviche and caldo [even though I'm not a huge fan of soup--it takes up far too much valuable retail space in my stomach with all the broth].

My four tacos and TT's three were wonderfully filling. My hands smelled like the meat I just devoured and that was an additional treat. All three salsas they brought to the table were great, and a fresh addition to the assorted hot sauces on each table. I'll definitely be back with my more adventurous friends."}
