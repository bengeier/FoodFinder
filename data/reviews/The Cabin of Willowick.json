{"text":"This is my favorite local restaurant. I absolutely love their scampi.  They are huge!  This is a nice place to go for good service and great food."}
{"text":"Best burger and fries I've ever had in Ohio. And the dragon roll was just as good as what you might get in Japan -- and beautifully presented. This restaurant should be on the top of your list if you're looking for great food in one of the most comfortable settings around. I am looking forward to checking out more items on the menu and the happy hour!"}
{"text":"The Cabin has a quaint and cozy atmosphere. It literally feels as though you are inside a log cabin in the middle of wine country or upscale ski resort. We were there for dinner on a Saturday night, which also came with fantastic live entertainment! The food was a bit underwhelming, as well as the service. Come to The Cabin for ambiance and character more than the menu."}
{"text":"A group of six of us visited the restaurant for dinner on a Saturday night.  The restaurant was not very busy, so our group was seated quickly.  Our waitress was attentive, but not intrusive, very nice.

The setting is special since it is one of the oldest buildings in Lake County.  It is nicely decorated and not very noisy.

I had the bacon wrapped filet.  It was nicely plated with green beans and mashed potatoes.  I  asked for it to be cooked medium and it was.  The others ordered the trout, salmon and the black cod special.  All the dishes looked very good and my companions seemed to enjoy their meals.

The only thing I would say that is negative was the pricing.  While everything was good the prices were a bit expensive for the local.  So, if you want to celebrate something special this might be a good place to visit."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 4 at 7:30 on a Saturday night. The food was outstanding, especially the prime rib and the pork chop. Sadly the band starts at 8. While they were really good, they were also excessively amped. We couldn't hear ourselves think. My phone showed it to be 80 decibels and we were in the back room. A vacuum cleaner at close range is 70. I will never take that late a booking again. They need to let diners dine, keep the sound down till 9. Totally spoiled the experience for anyone who wanted a conversation over dinner."}
{"text":"Best Steak I've had in ages. Absolutely delicious !! Cant wait to return."}
{"text":"We were really excited there was a sushi joint near us! We ordered via Uber Eats tonight and disappointed is an understatement. We ordered a wedge salad, 2 philly rolls, 1 dragon roll and 1 spider roll for a total of $54.99 ($4.99 for delivery).  It was definitely expensive, but it was date night and the reviews were good, so we figured we would go for it! It was a mistake. The wedge salad was the only redeeming factor (which is why we gave 2 stars), and the sushi was, in a word, gross. The philly rolls were bland and the dragon and spider rolls tasted off - to the point we threw them out, 25 dollars wasted. Maybe it's good for the other food, but be weary of the sushi!"}
{"text":"We visited the Cabin for the first time to celebrate my birthday. My husband was a bit hesitant to try a new restaurant for a special day, but we decided to go out of our comfort zone a bit. We were very happily surprised. Everything we had was outstanding! We shared sushi as an appetizer and could have made a meal on it. It was delicious! Our server warned us to not eat too much of the delicious bread and save room for dinner. When our entrees came we saw why - they were outstanding and HUGE portions. I ordered the scallops which were perfectly done. They were over a lobster risotto that actually had chunks of lobster in it. My husband ordered a scampi special and his was equally done to perfection. We knew that dessert was in our future, so ended up with a plenty to take home. We ordered the bread pudding for dessert, and once again we were raving about how delicious it was. This ended up to be a fabulous choice and worth the drive on a very stormy evening. (we live in Cleveland Heights) Our server was excellent and made the evening even more fun and special."}
{"text":"Very Nice atmosphere and people food, coulda been better VERY pricy but overall, a pretty nice restaurant"}
{"text":"I ate there for lunch today. It was a big group, 11 people. 
They had a holiday menu and that's it. No starters no salads (a LA carte), just the specials.  
I do not eat pork or beef, and they had only one chicken item on the menu. I requested that they make me something  vegetarian and they did. Pasta with veggies.  It was decent tasting - but lacked seasoning (per my taste).  No cheese in it either. The garnish (sprig of thyme) was casually thrown on the plate.  Not really edible since the herb was still on the stem.
I also had cream if mushroom soup. It was good. I did get couple small lumps of flour. But taste was good.
Dessert (tiramisu) was not fresh. The top was cracking up... Like when cheese sits in the fridge for too long. I have had better from grocery stores.
I would give them below average on decor. Really there is no decor. Just a log cabin with randomly placed old looking carpenter tools.
Service was below average also. We asked for bread, she never brought until 15 mins later.  After food came out, she never came back until after we were finished.
Not going back. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Good food, decent service, friendly staff. 

Overpriced, the tables are child height with matching chairs, the floor is uneven, and, oh yeah, it's way overpriced.

I did enjoy feeling young though...so there's that. In my late 30s, so I'll call that a win...albeit an expensive one. 

Would go again in a bind."}
{"text":"A restaurant that's been around for a long time and I'm glad I finally made my way in. I was going to give this four stars because the food did take longer than it should have but it did not disappoint. We sat on the lounge side where they offer a happy hour and we got a sushi roll and a cheese and chorizo french fry appetizer. Both were only five dollars a piece and were fantastic. For entrées we both ordered the prime rib dinner and substituted the green beans for the Latin style corn. Was one of the best prime ribs I've had and the corn and baked potato were both cooked perfect. The server was nice but like I said the food did take a little bit long especially considering we were the only ones there. (Came as they just opened) The prices were very reasonable and I love the cozy log cabin ambience. I look forward to coming back and getting the prime rib again."}
{"text":"Zero stars this place is junk and way over priced. 34$ for a steak that was thin cooked wrong and full of gristle. Better steak at Applebee's thats how bad it was"}
{"text":"Interesting steakhouse...NY strip was out of this world, couldn't believe how amazing the meat was (medium rare please). Why is it interesting? It's a cabin in the middle of nowhere (sorry Willowick) and there's a LED sign outside in case you want to aggravate your untreated glaucoma.

My wife and I had some incredible cous-cous, NY strip and...ah dammit those 2 cabernets are kicking in I'll remember what she had tomm.

The lamb stew was another stunner. I was expecting molecular porrtion of lamb tossed in water and potatoes Holy Grail style, but no, this was actual real size lamb cubes, wonderfully tender ( I think I may have heard a baby lamb baaing in my head...more )

Some co-workers or mine went for lunch recently, and I always pass this place on Lake Shore. Dare I say this is a hidden gem in plain sight!"}
{"text":"Last night, we dined at the Cabin for the second time in six months.  We love this place- what a gem. 

First, the people. This is a restaurant that makes everyone feel like a friend, from the servers to the owners. The service is prompt, professional, and friendly. The last time we were there, the owner gave us a tour of the patio, even though it was before patio season (note- with tall brick walls, umbrellas, and white lights strung across, it's a great patio).  We truly felt welcome both visits.

The food. Wow. My husband is a huge fan (and is very critical of) steak. In our last visit, he had the 12 ounce steak, and in this visit, he had the filet. He put it on par with XO Woodmere, Flemings, etc. In other words, great quality, at a lower price. It was accompanied by fries, sautéed mushrooms, and green beans- a hearty portion. 

Salmon. My first time, I had the salmon. It's been a few months, but it was perfectly done- crispy/flavorful on the outside, buttery tender on the inside.

The sushi. Wow. It's as good as any sushi house I have been to. My husband's Rainbow roll was a thing of beauty, with hearty and fresh cuts of fish. I loved my shrimp tempura and crab rolls so much, I made them my dinner (since I'm pregnant, I'm limited). Excellent.

Dessert- my husband had the chocolate cake- which was spongy, mousse-y, and out of this world. My birthday sorbet was a treat. 

All in all, you can get a meal of similar quality as many of the higher end places in Cleveland without the hassle and without the hype. The Cabin is a bit rustic, but for us, it adds to the charm. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So, I've been wanting to stop at \"The Cabin\" for quite a while, and frankly, it was okay, but I think I'll enjoy it more when I'm older...much older. (Mainly, because being in my 40's, I think my wife and I were the youngest people there besides the waitresses:) 

The prices are about what you'd expect for a place with well-dressed waiter/waitresses, nice crystal and a higher-class vibe. I have to say, the food was good. We both had the Chicken Parmigiana and it was very well done. The house salad even had something I never thought I'd enjoy; blue cheese. I usually hate that, but this was actually very tasty. My tastebuds were blown:)

The menu, I have to admit, is a tad limited; it reminds of a an old steak house that your grandparents would go out to when you were a kid. A bit formal, but simple fare, and, as you can expect, the decor is...cabin-ish. The place was not what I'd expected, especially for a place with a man-sized carved wooden bear out front. 

Now, did I get my money's worth; frankly, it could have been a little better. I mean, the service was GREAT, but the food was...okay. I'm a big one for getting what you pay for, so I think, for what we paid, I think it could have been a little more, but this place has been there a long while, so I think they're doing something right.

So, if you'd like to take your lady (or gent) out for a nice evening of some semi-formal dining with a little old-fashioned steak house flavor, give The Cabin a try, just leave the termites at home;)"}
{"text":"Went here for Thanksgiving. I thought it was very good. I can't recall the name of the dish I got, but it was chicken cooked with a lemon white wine butter sauce, very good. Everyone liked their dish. The lobster bisque was popular."}
{"text":"The shrimp was not deveined.  The bartender (Doug) was inattentive or deaf and rude.  I guess I didn't buy enough to get good service. The staff and service was rude, at best.   Only the entertainment was good, but I'll see them again when they play at the Willowick Lounge again.   I've never been treated so badly at a restaurant.  When I left I was crying .  I discreetly went into the empty dining room away from the lounge to complain about the bartender Doug and I was admonished by at least 4 people and ordered toelsewhere leave!  I cried while driving home.  I was the designated driver and I don't drink alcohol.   But, I believe the staff does while on duty.   When I was a bartender we couldn't drink while on duty. 

I only went there to see the band,  Dust My Broom,  but I will see them elsewhere.   Never again at The Cabin! 

I posted nice pictures of The Cabin from the outside and videos of the band on Facebook page.  

I was posting nice things and giving them free publicity.

You can view my facebook page at Joanne Littlejo Winfield 

I'm now going to pray for them.  They really hurt my feelings and I was being nice. 

Bye, 

JoJo"}
{"text":"Sushi here is just ok. I wouldn't go for sushi, but the atmosphere is wonderful. Charming dining rooms, bar and the patio is lovely on a summer evening. The food is always tasty. A little pricy but the portions are usually good."}
{"text":"It's a bit difficult to gauge this place from the outside, given its rustic appearance and unique location as a  on a street practically littered with strip malls and bars. Once you walk through the doors you feel as though you just stepped into the confines of a gaming lodge in the middle of the forest. The decor is welcoming, with wood trim everywhere and a nicely lit interior.

 I sat at the bar and opted for the salmon, which came with a delicious loaf of complimentary bread and homemade butter! The salmon arrived a short time later and it was simply phenomenal, perfectly cooked, expertly seasoned, and wonderfully delicious. I can't believe I drove past this place hundreds of times and never took the time to try it - I'm certainly glad I did!!"}
{"text":"My experience at the cabin was very disappointing and I do not plan on ever going back. They charge upscale prices for items that borderline on fast food quality. I ordered the tilapia and it tasted like nothing. It literally had no taste. 

In addition the waitress came over with the desert tray, left it at another table, and then disappeared without showing us the deserts. She did not return for 20 minutes and my family and I were left wondering when we were going to be given the check. It was an awkward experience to say the least. 

On the positive side the decor inside is nice."}
{"text":"This was not my first time at the The Cabin, but this is my first review.  I can't believe I haven't written a review previously!.  This is truly a hidden gem. I have visited several times for dinner and Happy Hour.  My husband and I visited this past Saturday, to celebrate our anniversary.  I easily made a reservation through Open Table (gotta get those points!) This was my husband's first visit and he enjoyed it.  We started with 2 glasses of wine.  We followed with iceberg wedge salads.  The salads were fresh, generously portioned and tasty!  Lettuce, bacon (yum!), red onions, tomato and bleu cheese dressing.  He ordered the pork chops and I ordered the lobster stuffed lobster.  He received 2 thick-cut bone-in pork chops, grilled to perfection, and nicely seasoned.  The chops were accompanied by au gratin potatoes, brussel sprouts, which were cooked just right, and tossed with bacon.  The lobster stuffed lobster was ok, probably wouldn't order it again, but glad that I tried it.  The lobster had been steamed or boiled perhaps, then split and stuffed.  The stuffing was a bit dry, and didn't have a lot of flavor.  The lobster tail meat was scrumptious, cooked perfectly.  The claw meat was a little bit dry and hard to eat.  I think that the 1/2 lobster was placed under a broiler, to brown the stuffing, which dried out the claw meat.  My entree was accompanied by green beans and au gratin potatoes.  Although I was pretty full, I couldn't resist ordering one of my favorite desserts, at The Cabin, grilled cheesecake!   A generous square of cheesecake, crust and all, sandwiched between 2 squares of homemade bread pudding, grilled on each side and accompanied by the most delicious caramel sauce.  This visit, the bread pudding was a little bit dry, but the overall dessert was still pretty tasty.  I love this little hidden gem of a restaurant and my husband and I will return.....very soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  I have been there on three occasions and have not been disappointed.  The ginger beef with rice noodles is out of this world delicious and the pork chops with collard greens is to die for GOOOOD!  This restaurant is a hidden gem. A little pricey but worth EVERY penny!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a steak. The portion is huge and the price is less than expected compared to a chain. The steak is better than all the main steakhouse chains. We came for half priced sushi nighy (thursday) and we're impressed with the quality."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for several years and was looking for a place to dine on my birthday because I wanted a steak ;-) Decided on the Cabin. This was a very delightful evening and I wish I could remember the waitresses name because she was outstanding. Met the chef and the new managers. This was the first day they had \"Martini Madness\" so most martinis were $5.00 so how can you go wrong, we through back quite a few. It's the Wednesday promotion and from the looks of the place, it works. Place was packed. Older crowd so I fit right in. I can certainly recommend this restaurant.

Food was very good, done to perfection. 

We dined on steak, prime rib, perch and pizza. No complaints. Party of five."}
{"text":"Nice establishment friendly server. prompt service and attention. Food came in a timely fashion.Just stopped in for happy hour nice bar selection. Sushi was a surprise  but tasty and elegantly done. Neat for a nice romantic dinner tor two. Reminds you of a cabin in Colorado  with all the trimmings."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough wonderful things about Terri and her staff. We hosted a 90th surprise birthday party for my mother in law at the Cabin of Willowick. We are from Cincinnati so began the planning process over the phone. Terri was so accommodating and helpful. She opened early so we had plenty of time to get in and decorate, do table arrangements, and set up the cake. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. The food was amazing. The wait staff was awesome. There are 2 fireplaces in the venue which both had fires burning in them while we were there. It was a very cozy, wonderful atmosphere for such a special occasion. I HIGHLY recommend checking it out for your next special event. Thank you again Terri and staff - we really appreciate all of you!"}
{"text":"Lunch break on a Friday lead me here. To start off the concept and design of the interior and exterior was really cool. I mean who doesn't  enjoy a nice log cabin. This inside was just as cool however it was a bit dark.(lacking light) perhaps to blend with the theme with the cabin. 

In any case during this trip I kept is fairly safe and offer the cheese  burger  lunch special for $5 plus fries. Overall the burger was ok. Nothing amazing however the fires were the star for me. The fries with some added malt vinegar were awesome. Fried crispy and still tender on the inside. This was the savior of the meal in my opinion. If I'm in the are I'd stop in again to try some of the other items on the menu.(which read pretty good) But I don't think I'd go out my way to visit here to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night to see a band. First the people at the front were not friendly and we were told \"there were no tables\" we went to the bar and fended for ourselves to get a seat. It seemed like we were really putting people out to help us. The bar area was undersized and drinks were pretty expensive. I got mussels for and appetizer many of them were unopened and some of them did not taste right (I felt sick after eating them on through the following Monday). We waited for an hour for our entrees. I got pretzel crusted walleye which was seriously underwhelming. People I was with had a couple pasta dishes they really liked. For the money there are probably hundreds of places you can go in northeast Ohio that would be better."}
{"text":"I have not been to the Cabin since my confirmation dinner in 8th grade, so needless to say it's been a few years. I heard through the grapevine there is new ownership,  they have changed and updated things. It did not disappoint.

Our service was attentive but not oversolicitous, the owner came around and said hello and thanked us for coming. Our starters were the French onion soup and grilled Caesar salad, generous portions and both were delicious. I had the brisket,which was cooked to perfection and so tender,  the green beans were cooked just right and the brussel sprouts had just the right amount of bacon flavor. My friends' salmon was delicious and came with kale which she said was outstanding. Unfortunately,  we both were behaving and sticking to our diets, but had the waitress share the dessert menu with us. It sounded amazing and all homemade on premise, from chocolate cake, to a lemon tart or a bread pudding that came with a twist. Next time only appetizers, vino and dessert! 

I have to say I was impressed, will return and thought the prices were comparable with anything with this selection of quality food and service in the area. Ample parking which is a bonus. Well worth a night out in snowy CLE."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!!  We went to celebrate my husband 25th anniversary at his job.  We had our rehearsal dinner here 5 plus years ago.  After reading recent reviews we were wondering what went wrong with this place.  Our experience tonight was great.  We both got french onion soup.  Honestly the best I've ever had.  I got the seared ahi tuna dinner and it was outstanding.  My husband got one of the specials, roast duck and he love it.  We will be back.  I disagree with all the negative reviews.  I do have to say the restaurant wasn't busy like it used to be.  The prices are a bit high for the area but honestly our dinner tonight was worth every penny."}
{"text":"With new owners and a new chef, this is a must experience high end restaurant. We had a fabulous dinner on Thursday night. The menu has a nice selection of meats, poultry and seafood. I had prime rib and my husband had the filet. We both said at the same time \"this just melts in your mouth.\" Perfectly seasoned and cooked. After the table next to us received their dessert we needed to try it too... AMAZING fried cheese cake w a strawberry sauce drizzled over top. Again this is a MUST experience. The manager Terry stopped at every table making sure service and food were above expectations. I definitely recommend this high end restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were visiting our old hometown, CLE, from South Carolina so we thought we would try The Cabin of Willowick.  The Cabin was one our favorites long ago so we were curious what is was like now.

We were excited to find a wonderful new decor, and a great menu. On arrival we were greeted by their GM Teri and our server was fantastic.
Chef Carmen prepared a swordfish special that was remarkable.  We go to seafood restaurants in Charleston SC and this presentation was the best I've had in years.  My wife's dinner salad was excellent and we finished the evening with a wonderful multi layer chocolate cake that featured chocolate mousse between the layers and a rich fudge frosting. Simply outstanding!

Chef Carmen and his team are nearing the end of their first year in business and if this visit is any reflection, they will thrive here for years to come.  If you live in the area or if you're just visiting give the Cabin a try. You will be thoroughly impressed and enjoy every delicious bite!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for my birthday dinner. We loved everything we had. First we started with Pesto Chicken Soup, The bread was excellent artisan bread piping hot from the oven, Mom had the NY strip and I had the pork chop dinner. Everything was delicious and ample serving size. We were happily surprised that the veges which came with our meal were a good full serving size not a foo foo pricey restaurant size. The pork chops glaze was just the right amount of sweetness and a large meal. It is two pork chops cook to perfection. 
The happy hour menu looked interesting and I wish there were s few drink specials. But we had a great meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience thanks to the great staff and owner of this landmark restaurant."}
{"text":"This was the go to place for the moneyed crowd when I was growing up. It has burned down and been rebuilt since then, but it is still good. Our party ordered the ice burg lettuce wedge salad and the chop salad. Both were enjoyed. We also ordered the shrimp scampi, grilled veal medallions, and the sea scallops. Everyone really appreciated their meal. All the food was well prepared, and the vegetables were fresh and cooked to perfection. The only thing that wasn't top notch where the \"french fries\", ordered in lieu of a baked potato for one entree.  Too thick to be thoroughly crispy, this was the one item not quite to our dinner's taste. Mixed drinks were strong (better be for the price) and house wine was good. This was a rather pricy meal (I'd give $$$$), but worth it on the special occasion."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really cute and cozy. We came during lunch and apparently it was very busy although there were only three other tables. 

The waitress was nice but also took very long to grab our orders. The food was ok I ordered a chicken sandwich with fries. Unfortunately the service was soooo slow that we could not really enjoy it.  They really need to hire more people during lunch times. Do not come for lunch if your on a time restriction. 

We came with an hour of time and still no sense of urgency even when you tell them you have to go. :("}
{"text":"Other than the wine and the beautiful layout of the restaurant I would never go back! The waitress MaryEllen we had was very nice and professional but the menu was very small and did not have much of a variety of anything. For the prices they charge for entrees to not even give you a salad with it and to charge half price (which the minimum would be $4 extra for a house salad) seems to be much more upscale than they can provide. Seeing what people around me ordered and hearing conversations of \"locals\" that come there it is pretty much a steakhouse and nothing more that people come for."}
{"text":"I love steak! I would even go to say it's my favorite food. This is the best steak I have had in a long time. I usually find myself at your chain places like Texas road house, outback or sometimes Applebee's. But this time we decided to try a local steakhouse. My husband and I we both got the new york strip steak! I thought it was fairly priced $29. You got au gratin potatoes, green beans, maitre d'hotel butter topped the steak. Now I don't know if they allow side substitutions because I was ok with the sides they had. 

Don't forget to check in they offer a dessert with an entree purchase. Also it's on the Yelp cash back list of restaurants so don't forget to link your credit card. This place has daily specials M-F and happy hour from 5-7pm."}
{"text":"It was our first visit and it was fantastic! I had the shrimp and grits and it was not the typical dish (that usually includes chorizo) it was served with collard greens and fried green tomatoes! The shrimp were a very nice size and the green tomatoes were cooked just right! My husband had the Scampi's and they were EXCELLENT! They have an o.k. wine list..The dessert was also just as tasty! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food. Service is good, nothing spectacular. Once we were asked what the occasion was, as if we need one to be foodies (lol). Pricey and may really benefit from lowering prices because the food is not comparable to other restaurants at this price point."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday with another couple.  It was unimpressive.  
Stuffed mushrooms- boring
Calamari - small portion, decent taste
scampi- this was surprisingly good
lobster tails-HUGE disappointment, even by OH standards
sirloin-no flavor.  I had to use A1 in order to eat it.
Service: excellent- waitress was great.
 WE WERE THE ONLY PATRONS.  The entire place was empty save ONE person at the bar.  The building itself it actually very nice.

Dinner for four was over $200....NEVER again.  Better food can be at at TGIFridays; and, for the price they charge here....it's a downright swindle."}
{"text":"The new owner stepped up the game on food. Total transformation on food. The cowboy steak is amazing. Juicy, tender. Coffee cream pie is my favorite. We been back few times since."}
{"text":"Celebrated our anniversary. Pick The Cabin last minute . Had the bacon filet and the lobster tails.  Excellent !!!Best martinis, Doug is a master!Marilyn was the perfect waitress. So glad we went. The new menu has wonderful choices. We will be back for burgers and sushi."}
{"text":"Love this place! Whenever I am visiting home I enjoy stopping by for a great martini and fantastic food! Best place in the area!"}
{"text":"During my visit to The Cabin of Willowick of was informed the \"Prime Rib\" was not a steak, its \"Prime Rib\". This was a great place, awesome service and great food. Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"So this is essentially like my neighborhood bar, it is in walking distance of my house. The staff have been together forever and they remember everyone. This has actually gotten my mom in trouble because we snuck off for a drink, she returned with my dad and they accidently told her!!!! Haha
But really great ladies. I always sit at the bar, we love the bartenders  happy hour is the best. You seriously can't beat it, $5 full size burgers and Cubans that are epic. They also have super cheap lpaded chorizo fries my boyfriend loves. My absolute favorite is the happy hour fried green tomatoes. Those my instant go to. 
Another pleasant surprise is how great their sushi is. With a place named \"The cabin\" you would think upscale comfort food or bbq, but their sushi is always good. The vegan sushi roll really needs to leave out the carrot though, I don't like my sushi THAT crunchy, it makes the rest of the roll fall apart around it. Every other roll is on point. Oh and it's half price on Thursday, even for carry out!! I frequent the take out option because it's so close to home, how could I not?? 
Of you ever have the opportunity to do their holiday menus I suggest it, mothers day or thanksgiving were both amazing. 
But onto my favorite part, the desserts. I have finally tried every single dessert and I have yet to be disappointed. My favorite is probably their GIGANTIC chocolate cake, for that price you get like a quarter of the cake and it's so rich and amazing. My least favorite is the lemon custard dish, I do enjoy fresh fruit desserts but the sugar crust thing on it is just a weird texture for me, but just crush it up and try it if you love fruity dishes as well. 
I've only ever tried one item I didn't love...the crab cakes. With so many more amazing options just try something else. Their French onion soup is great. Literally anything else is a great choice. 
Seriously stop in and support a great family owned neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Went to the Cabin for the clambake. Great food. Great pace - Never are rushed, which we appreciate. They never disappoint."}
{"text":"We had a great time at the Cabin this weekend! We dined next to the fireplace on a cold snowy night so that was very much welcomed. 

I ordered the filet with mashed potatoes and the steak was perfect.  I'm glad I ate the mashed potatoes as I was clearly over served in the bar later :)

We ended up dancing the night away to some live music with a lovely male/female duo who played many of the oldies. I hung out with a group of ladies who were all 65 yrs and older so yeah, I don't mind Motown in my 30's :)

Take your Mom and Dad or uncle who still enjoys live music for some good times on  Friday nights at the Cabin.

If you are in your 20s or 30s, don't expect to find a date here."}
