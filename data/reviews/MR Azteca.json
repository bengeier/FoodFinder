{"text":"Service was fast and very warm. Tacos were great. We had some kind of sandwich with beef inside as well. That was tasteless though and the cook didnt spread the red bean on the bread and didnt even cut it through..(I had to ask for a knife to do it myself) Maybe because he was in a rush because it was the last part of the soccer game but anywa I would have liked my sandwich not to suffer from it."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I wanted Mexican food and came across this place on yelp. I'm so happy we tried it out. Authentic Mexican food! Definitely will be back for their 1$ taco night."}
{"text":"We've been on the hunt for a good taco place in montreal for a couple of years now and basically settled with matraca and taco Tijuana because we couldn't find anything better. But both places are a bit overpriced and limited in other ways as well.   Azteca, on the other hand was perfect! Four tacos for $5 and you can mix and match. (That's half the price of the other two places and tacos were delicious!) Plus they have other specials depending on the day (e.g., $1 tacos), and offer other food (like enchiladas, burritos, tortas and quesadillas) but we might always come here on Fridays because the special that day is mole enchilada (emmoladas)! I cannot tell you how much I love that rich, sweet, chocolatey/spicy sauce on my enchiladas and the portion was huge. Total for a very filling dinner for two with tax and tip was about $30. Nice interior, too.   Seems to be a local favourite because it was quite busy. I'm surprised there are not more rave reviews!"}
{"text":"Bien ordinaire, mauvais service, bruyant avec écran géant avec vidéos non nécessaire, bouffe très très ordinaire, je déconseille cet endroit."}
{"text":"We went during their 1$ taco night. While nothing was bad, nothing was great. I did find it better than the other 1$ taco place Ive been to (Impactaco) Was disappointed to see their Tacos al Pastor didnt contain any pineapple! My favorite was the Lengua (tongue) although it was lacking in flavor. I ate 8 tacos in about 5 minutes and was not completely full. At 1$ you cant go wrong but Ive had better so giving it 4 stars. Would I go back? Maybe not cause its far from my place, but if I was in the area I would. But honestly Im tired of all these taco places opening up years after tacos were already trendy!"}
{"text":"Tiny little place but perfect for a small snack like on Mondays and Tuesday $1 taco night"}
{"text":"I dare you to find better, more authentic tacos in Mtl. Because seriously, this place is it!  I was told by latino friends, this is where Montreal-Mexicans go for their taco fix. So I obviously went in with very high expectations. And I was not disappointed.   The tacos are packed with flavour, spice and all that yummy taco goodness. Don't go in expecting those big fat American tacos, these are the typical small soft shell tacos that come with cilantro, lime and onion.  I personally recommend the:  Carnitas / Al pastor / Chorizo   I also tried their lamb soup, which I was told was very legit, but to be honest not my cup of tea.   All to say, this place rocks and is where it's at for tacos in montreal."}
{"text":"3.5 service un peu lent mais le staff est très courtois et sympathique. Ai-je mentionné le spécial 1$ tacos les mardis et mercredis? Oui oui vous avez bien lu 1$! Les tacos sont très bons et authentiques. Par contre, le flan était bof, il était coagulé."}
{"text":"Very nice people and service. Excellent burritos, tacos and an amazing Sunday special (I had pozole, which was amazing)."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with some friends. I had the beef Torta sandwich with cheese, it was really filling and delicious. We had a great time, friendly waitresses, good food, cheap prices what's not to like."}
{"text":"Okay first things first... I'm from California, so I'd like to think of myself as relatively knowledgable when it comes to tacos. And the one thing I have noticed off the bat here in Montreal is that places only use one tortilla for their tacos. Whyyyy?!?? Back in Cali (and of course, MEXICO), taquerias and taco stands alike make their tacos with two tortillas. This adds reinforcement and prevents the tacos--which are typically filled with lots of meat and drippings and sauce--from falling apart. Or, if you're like some of my friends, you can split the tortillas up and make two, less-filled and easier to manage tacos. It's practical.   Anyways, so MR Azteca. The restaurant itself is super charming. Friendly service, an ambiance that reminds me of the Mexican joints in Los Angeles. I went for the \"3 for $10\" taco deal (it was a Friday), and ordered the steak, chorizo, and pork taco. Also ordered a coffee (I was sleepy), which came with a little touch of cinnamon, which was nice. In about 5 minutes my plate of tacos arrived, and like I've noticed with other taco spots, the tacos had one tortilla. So I was like okay, maybe this is a Montreal thing. I proceeded to dress my tacos (lime squeeze, dab of red sauce, dab of green sauce) and I picked up the first one (the steak I think). Not bad. It had some cactus is there which was interesting. Five bites and gone. Next up, the pork. Picked it up, and it starts the fall apart cause why? There was only ONE TORTILLA. Sigh. Well, I did my best to salvage the situation, which meant me looking somewhat like a hungry pitbull at dinnertime, but whatever. I'm pretty sure I enjoyed the taco. Third taco wasn't so bad, probably because I was extra careful this time.   I'd say this place was good enough to try again, but maybe be extra careful with how I handle the tacos. Or maybe I'll just try the tamales. But what's the fun in that?"}
{"text":"I've been trying out several restaurants serving tacos lately and this place serves some of the best tacos in town. I ordered the pasteur and marinated porc tacos both are definitely a 10/10. The porc is tender and tasty, and the pasteur exceeds what I expect from a standard pasteur taco.  I might not have the most precise words to describe Mexican food but if you are a fan of tacos, then this is the place to be!  The location is about 5minutes walk from Jean-Talon metro in a nice small cozy place.   For sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was craving Mexican food then came across this place.  Pigged out on their $1 tacos (had Mexican Beef, Beef Tongue, & Chorizo Sausage) before & after our meal. The taco are small; 2 bites they are done but tasty. They provided 2 hot sauces; one a green lime chilly (mild) & a red chilly (hot) both really good.   Also had a dish with fried black beans with Chorizo on top of a soft tortilla. This was amazingly tasty.   The food & drinks (Orchada) were very good. The only complaint is the service was kind of slow. Especially after we finished our dishes, I waited quite some time before I ended up waving down a waitress for more water & tacos.   3.5 Star rating would be more accurate than a 4-Star."}
{"text":"Their tacos are so good! I recommend the marinated carnitas or barbacoa! If you wish to try this place, go on a wednesday when tacos are 1$ each. Also, their servcie is really friendly and the place has a nice mexican atmosphere to it! Recommend 100%!"}
{"text":"Soooo delicious and well-priced! I wish it was closer to home.  We sat on the patio and started with a pitcher of hibiscus tea - so refreshing! I had the enchiladas, husband had some tacos, someone else in the group had the birria soup. Everything was amazing! Service was very friendly and prompt.   There is nothing not to like about this place!"}
{"text":"OK, OK, OK... I agree that a restaurant should receive 5 stars because it is hitting it out of the park on a multitude of factors: food presentation, the ambiance of the restaurant, the friendliness of the staff and, of course, the food. I am giving Mr. Azteca 5 stars because the tacos are so authentic and wonderful, who really cares about the other factors? Over the last several weeks, my husband and I have come here at least once a week with our girls for dinner. Not only are the tacos wonderful, the guacamole is marvelous, too! Our whole family eats here for less than $20 on Tuesdays' and/or Wednesdays' $1 taco nights. The service is really fast and very friendly and the restaurant is very kid-friendly. We are fans of the marinated beef and chorizo tacos. One caveat: the red salsa is unreasonably spicy. Therefore, we ask for only the ''salsa verde'' with our order; which I think you will find is still quite spicy.  Now, we are making plans to come back one week-end morning for their breakfast/brunch specials.  Thank you, Mr. Azteca, for bringing some wonderfully-delicious and extremely reasonably-priced Mexican authenticity to Villeray!  By the way, Mr. Azteca was cash only, but as of today, the restaurant accepts Interact, too."}
{"text":"Dos tacos pourfavor!  I woke up with a craving... and that craving was for some real tacos. Not oldel paso but the real stuff.  This place is located right under Jean Talon and well hidden, once found you know you're at a Mexican restaurant. Tacos come in 2.. and with that you can have a variety of them. I took the beef and chorizo taco.  1 word was delicious!:)  As much as I wanted to try other thing my stomach couldn't handle it.   But this place is a must to try with friends or family!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"C'est tres tres good. 4 tacos for $6, I had 2 marinated beef and 2 pork based on the super lovely waitresses recommendations. They were so juicy, so lovingly flavoured, so damn good. I slathered them with the green hot sauce which was definitely spicy but not like crying crazy hot and full of flavour.   The room is bright and clean with Aztec art and TVs playing Mexican music videos. There is a fridge with sodas including a whole collection of the Jarritos including the tamarind one I love.   The service throughout was so friendly and helpful and charming. You could definitely make more headway here if you spoke Spanish, but between English and French and Smiling everyone made themselves understood.  Can't wait to go back, so good!!"}
{"text":"Nous avons essayé le \"take-out\" un samedi soir de tempête. Seulement 2 autres clientes à 18:30 dans le restaurant.   Tout était délicieux! Nous avons commandé les \"flautas\", tacos boeuf, tacos porc et la guacamole et chips en entrée.  Les serveuses au comptoir étaient bien gentilles.  Seul hic, ils acceptent les cartes de crédit mais encouragent \"fortement\" toute autre forme de paiement! ;) Ils mentionnent: \"ok pour cette fois-ci\"."}
{"text":"We tried Mr. Azteca in advance of our daughters 1st birthday party and loved the food.  Being from Texas, having lived in California, and after spending time in Mexico, I feel I know the difference between Tex-Mex, Cal-Mex, and true Mexican food, and what is good and bad in all types.  This is the real deal and I can't stress enough how amazing the food is.    Aside from that, Rosina, the owner, was amazing to work with, in getting my catering order together and was even fantastic with corralling and helping with my toddlers while meeting for my order.    If you want awesome REAL Mexican food in Montreal and want a true family-run restaurant, this is your place!"}
{"text":"One of our Mexicain friends brought over tacos during the summer from Azteca and we devour them instantly. I was surprised at how simple details like the chopped onions and cilantro made such an important difference. Ever since we have gone to the small restaurant on Saint Hubert that has grown in size and notoriety. With dollar tacos on Tuesdays and Wednesdays it seals the deal. The best tacos in Montréal. My favorite El Pastor. I haven't eaten anything else as yet."}
{"text":"Les tacos à 1$ ne valent pas le détour, servis sans accompagnements, très peu garnis... Il y a des restos mex bien meilleurs!"}
{"text":"Très bonne cuisine mexicaine ! -Burrito biftef servi avec riz et haricots noirs pour 8dollars : tout etait bon (un peu huileux mais super tasty). -Enchillada poulet pour 12dollars  Un large choix pour des prix pas du tout excessif. Enfin une bonne alternative à El Rey del Taco où je suis décue depuis quelques temps.   Bref courez y ! (Mais pas à trop nombreux, la salle est petite!)"}
{"text":"Best place to eat tacos !!!!!! We went to El Rey del Taco and it was okey but when we tried here we marked it as our favourite... nice environment, food and staff :)"}
