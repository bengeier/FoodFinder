{"text":"I ordered the large mixed (chicken and beef) shawarma and this thing was almost as big as my arm! It was humongous and good value too. I added the hot sauce and it has quite the kick to it. I'm a big eater and I couldn't finish it. It was delicious and I will be back. The other thing I liked about this place was that it stock a lot of ethnic drinks from the Middle East. I'll be sure to try one next time."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have been to. The portions are not very big like other places but the flavour and makes it perfect, we met the owner and the service was excellent, we will go back a lot for sure if we are in the area,

I will recommend to management to get lamb as well.

Overall great experience"}
{"text":"Awesome place....had the chicken Shawarma wrap and it definitely the best I've had in Calgary. Service friendly and place is nice bright and clean."}
{"text":"Gave this outlet another shot today after the last visit and we didn't regret it. 

The best part about the dishes here is that all the components that form the plates go together so well; from the garlic potatoes to the creamy hummus together with the well marinated beef and chicken. Got the salad this time instead of corn and it was great.

They had complimentary baklava and lollipops for the kids too, kudos to Izo and his team. A great addition!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food was very good for the price. The portion was a little small but overall good value for money. Friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"Terrible service and even worse food. It looks and tastes like something made in a high school cafeteria. Filled mostly with rice and you have to pay for everything as an add on. The bald gentleman serving us was beyond rude. I will never return. If you want real shawarma at an amazing price with everything included head to shawarma place in Forrest lawn. It's incredible and the staff are so nice."}
{"text":"Tried the beef shawarma; was good. Well cooked, the pita seemed a bit thinner than in other places, but it actually enhanced the flavour and was a bit crispy coming off the grill. Downside of the experience was the customer service. Not sure if it was a cultural thing, but the young man serving me kept trying to say things that I suspect was just him trying to be funny but just came off as awkward and weird. I went to order and he said \"have the falafel, come on.\" I've never had falafel in my life and knew I wanted the shawarma. He acted disappointed, and then made additional comments to poke fun at my choice of drink, and then my choice of toppings. I usually have a sense of humour about stuff like that, but this was done deadpan and didn't seem like a 'joking' manner, enough to make me feel uncomfortable - as if I had done something wrong in ordering what I wanted. This was also my first time in the restaurant, and while I have been to donair/shawarma places before, it is still sufficiently outside my own cultural upbringing that I'm not 100 percent comfortable in ordering from the menu - so the strange attempts at humour intensified my discomfort. I may try them again in future if I'm in the neighbourhood but definitely didn't like this experience."}
{"text":"The first time I went here I was really impressed. Portion size was really good, tasted delicious and I was impressed with the quality of the service and the care that went into making my food. The next time I went I brought my boyfriend. I found the serving size smaller although I ordered the exact same thing And my boyfriend thought the garlic spread tasted a little off. He had concerns that it was sitting out and not refrigerated. I went yesterday ordered a large donair and got the same portion as the medium I had ordered the week before. While at home I thought it tasted a bit funny and upon inspection noticed the donair meat was not cooked through and was pretty much raw in the middle. I feel really disappointed because I feel like that is something that could have been avoided if the guy making my donair had been more focused on providing a good product to the paying customer over preparing his own lunch. I have now felt sick for 2 days and will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"I ordered from this restaurant off of Uber Eats and received the wrong order. When I called to tell them this and get what I ordered, they insisted that I had my order wrong, despite the fact that I was looking at my order while I talked to them on the phone. They told me it \"wasn't their problem\" and refused to give me my money back."}
{"text":"Definitely one of a kind in Calgary. A great place to drop by and pick up some take out. Dining in can be a bit hard as there aren't many tables and if you do get one it gets pretty hot with the kitchen right in front of you.

The shawarma wraps are great and filled with fresh ingredients. This restaurant has a distinct flavour that you can't find elsewhere in Calgary. Prices are comparable to other places in the city. 

Definitely A+ and would recommend friends try it out!"}
{"text":"This place has in my opinion the best shawarma I ever had. No other place offers so many toppings.
A must try!!!"}
{"text":"Paid extra $3.50 for more beef is worth the money ...I ordered need donair plantter with drink total of $20 ... the beef didn't look at the picture ... I got all the little pieces of beef almost like grounded beef ... still taste delicious tho ! And excellent bake potato:"}
{"text":"Donair was ok. They said to get the chicken as it was made in house. Not rushing back."}
{"text":"Waited for this place to open for about a month. Was pretty disappointed. Order the mixed wrap (only 1 size to chose from). It was the most expensive wrap and I was questioning WHERE the meat was. Now if I'm paying 14$ for a wrap ..I think u shouldn't have to look for the meat.  
Meat was bland and no flavour.  Also the meat was NOT crispy.  Overall I wouldn't suggest this place. Shawarma king on 14st by 17ave sw is by fair the best for donairs and shawarma. Or cedars deli."}
{"text":"I did not see any previous review referred to by CL below from 6 days ago so I assume CL was referring to my photos that I uploaded here about 9 days ago. This store is definitely open, our family dined at this new Macleod location on March 18."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite ever go-to middle-eastern food in town! Their food is absolutely delicious, hot and fresh every single time. I recently discovered this eatery and have been going frequently ever since, it's no wonder that they are busy! The food is made right in front of you and all the toppings and sauces are homemade and fresh to the taste. The staff are great and very friendly, definitely a place to go try! Keep up the great work and delicious food."}
{"text":"Excellent falafels!!  The wraps are nice and light and flavourful.  And the falafels are wonderfully crispy!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma and it was delicious.
I'll be back for sure to try the donair meat.  I would 
have like having cheese as an option.

A"}
{"text":"Great food and I especially like this location as the staff are really friendly and the girl at the cashier is super cute :)"}
{"text":"Me and my family like this shop. They have 3 branches that i know of and we always go to jerusalem shawarma almost every weekend. Our favorite is family for 3 or 4. There are plenty of food with that order and tasty. Today i went to the one near to royal oak by placing order thru phone and then pick up to take away at 910 pm. I've ordered the for family of 5. Go in, pay and take away. Rush home since there since i have a surprise guest from BC just arrived and need something quick to eat. 
Unfortunately arrived home, the one that being packed do not have the salad. They have totally miss my salad. My mistake as well do not check it before i left the restaurant."}
{"text":"Re-visited shortly after this original post once I noticed after months, it was actually open.   However I did revisit, and was not impressed. I really wasn't. No place designated or setup as the start of the ordering line. Infact I stood for about 5 minutes infront of the ingredients table without being acknowledged by the staff.  Food (beef donair) wasn't impressionable with reasonable portions but nothing extraordinary. 

I'll be going back  today to try one more time. Those that have a 5 star review for this place and its their sole review, I'd be seriously skeptical, after confirming and reporting another reviewer for this place as the actual owners. Every owner is going to give his restaurant 5 stars, guaranteed. 

But I'll give this place a second try and review after."}
{"text":"I'm from the US and came here for dinner and it was AMAZINGGGG. Fast service, big portions, authentic. If you like Mediterranean food, go here!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Always fresh and always consistent. Friendly staff. Their lunch hours can have a bit of a line up, but that doesn't affect the quality of the food at all. Our go-to place for shish tawouk, kafta and shawarma platters and sandwiches. Their fatoush salad is the best I've ever had at a middle eastern style restaurant -  it's not drowning in lemon juice. Hoummous is super and the garlic sauce is very authentic. Enjoy your food!"}
{"text":"Fresh, fabulous and fast! That is all you need to know. Oh, and, the platters are out of this world! I'll never get enough of the dreamy garlic cloud which is nestled beside the delectable spiced potatoes! Sigh!"}
{"text":"Great food and greatCustomer service.They messed up my order and when they realized they apologized and returned our money."}
{"text":"The Country Hills Jerusalem Shawarma is much better to the 16th Avenue Jerusalem Shawarma in both service and the thoroughness of how the meat is cooked.  If you want a good experience, go to the Country Hills location. 

The service here is poor, as the cashier expects a tip after you have placed your order.  The guys behind the counter load up on lettuce or purple cabbage as a filler for your shawarma. I've had their top three meat dishes, and been disappointed each and every time here.  I feel they under cook their meat in order to meet the demand of their customers, making the next day unkind after eating at Jerusalem Shawarma.  

I've eaten at the 16th Avenue Jerusalem Shawarma three times now, and like baseball, three strikes and you're out!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal, owner is nice and great food. His falafel and shawarmas and delicious. They have their specials on a daily basis posted outside. You will love their offerings."}
{"text":"Excellent value , food is fresh and flavorful.  Not very salty.  Decor is warm and inviting.  Staff is generous."}
{"text":"Unbelievably tasty middle eastern/Mediterranean Cuisine.  The warm and friendly staff make it wonderful.  Some of the best food in all of Calgary!"}
{"text":"Wish there was a rating less than one star because that is what their customer service deserved. It was an absolute joke the way we were treated.

We decided to go for a nice dinner because the food had been great the times I had been there before. It wasn't too busy when we got there so we decided to dine in. About halfway through our meal, a man who worked there came over and put a reserved sign on our table and gave us a shrug as if to say 'get out.' We were confused but didn't pay much attention to it. Fast forward to 2 minutes later, a family comes in and stands in front of our table eyeing us down and trying to intimidate us to leave. Meanwhile, we still have over half of out meals left. The man who worked there then came back and asked us if we wanted tea. We were confused but accepted his offer. He then proceeds to say \"yeah i'll give it to you if you move tables.\" He continued to try to bribe us to move, if we wouldn't, we would be removed. There were numerous empty tables across the restaurant and the group waiting was only a party of 4. Naturally we were a little shaken up and were there first so you can imagine how upset we were.

Because of this, I will NEVER return to this restaurant. As well as I will let everyone know about my experience. I was a frequent customer and I hope this was worth losing my buisness. 

Foods great, Service is depressing."}
{"text":"I have been all over the city looking for a decent Donair place. I was not disappointed! This place is awesome! I would give 6 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"VERDICT:

The crunchy wrap on the outside traps in all the juices for a hands clean and juicy experience, also adds in nice texture that is pleasing to the senses. The chicken is juicy and very tender and seasoned quite well. They gave out baklava for free which was a huge bonus. The sauce is decent, it is simply present, it adds to the flavours but does NOT make you want to cry, although it invokes a couple tear drops. It is smaller in portion size which may be more sensible but less of an experience. I cannot speak for the beef, however. Additionally, they include red pickled thing inside which I am indifferent to. There is less material inside but it is definitely a symphony -- Beethovens ninth donair perhaps -- in the mouth. The service is very fast and very kind, they know you by name and are very personable. 

All in all, I would rate this place a 4.8 falafels out of 5."}
{"text":"Yum! A local favourite for me. I really haven't had a bad meal here. The crew working are very friendly and very efficient. My personal favourite is the chicken.

We've also ordered the family portions here. They are large and well priced. 

In order of hungriness and number of people you need to feed, this is what I'd recommend.
- Lunch portion = small wrap
- Dinner portion = large wrap
- Really hungry portion - Shawarma plate
- Two people with small appetites/lunch portion - Shawarma plate
- Two or more hungry people - start looking at their family sized dishes.

All very good. It's too bad I live so close, I think my pants are getting tighter! ;)"}
{"text":"Great food.  Very generous portions.  Great value.  Lots of locations to choose from.  Friendly staff.  Quick service.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this spot. Apparently I've waited too long lol. I got the chicken shawarma plate (my standard) and it was fantastic. Huge portion, two meals for me :). 
The location has parking. It is extremely clean inside. The staff were great, friendly and efficient!!! Can't wait to try more !!"}
{"text":"Warning! This place is addictive. D food s so good - wish they had a 24h drive thru. Really good deal when u go for d combo. U get a free pop. Get d turkish pop drinks. Pineapple s really good."}
{"text":"This place is great! The guys are always so friendly and welcoming. For a while, they handed out free baklava, which was awesome to nibble on while waiting for my shawarma to be ready. Everything is made super fresh with delicious ingredients and sauces. I go back a few times a month!"}
{"text":"One of the best in the city.  Great service.  Very fresh food.   Clean.  Great variety.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was jonesing for a meatless meal and thought ld check out this place. First, l found their prices expensive. But their portions are quite large.  A falafel platter cost me 14$ and it had 6 freshly made falafels, some dolmades, a salad that was a fattoush salad that was decent.  I did not dine in although there was a few tables there.  I like the open concept kitchen as you can watch them prepare your food for you but l will likely not return because l thought their prices were too steep and l know if other places that are just as good and more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"New location that recently opened in The Royal Oak Park complex (right by Planet organic and the Shell gas station)

I arrived after lunch and there was a bit of a line up for ordering/take out. Worth the wait. They don't have allot of tables inside for staying in and all were full. I would say they have less than 10 tables for dine in. 

I ordered the beef shawarma plate to go which came with plenty of food. Everything tasted delicious. The plate came with beef, Greek salad, pita bread and hummus. I didn't end up finishing it all since I was stuffed but it was all fresh and really good. Price was reasonable, I believe $13.00 for the plate and it was plenty of food.

All staff were friendly and place was nice and clean. Will defiantly be back again."}
{"text":"I love a good falafel and/or shwarma!  And this place does not disappoint.  They don't use a typical pita which can be quite heavy.  Instead they use dough they make themselves that is so thin and crispy.  My mouth is watering just reliving the moment!!  Staff is super friendly and location is very clean.  I was stuffed with the medium, can't imagine eating a large.  Will definitely be back to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice shawarma place, nothing fancy or mindblowing, but I like the fact that there are a lot of extras and ingredients that you can add to your sandwich / shawarma, and the sesame and mango sauces are very tasty. Also good price - 2 shawarmas for 9,99$."}
{"text":"Best Sharma in Calgary, hummus is smooth and the potato and garlic sauce are where its at, service is good, clean definitely worth dropping by if craving Sharma"}
{"text":"I enjoyed their Royal Oak location so much that I had to try out the 16th Ave location too. Same delicious food and even better seating and atmosphere. Was very busy Saturday lunchtime but still served quickly. Chicken shish again!"}
{"text":"I've traveled in Turkey, Jordan and Palestine but this is the best I've had. The first thing you notice as you come through the door is the delicious aroma, then the clean interior. We had the bbq chicken (Shish Tawouk) which came with nicely seasoned rice, potatoes, salad and the appropriate sauces. It was served on a ceramic platter! Five stars! I will be back."}
{"text":"I've tried everything on their menu. This place is simply amazing, probably my favourite way to spend money for food. The Staff are sweethearts always a good attitude, the restaurant is always fully staffed making service fast and efficient. The food is clean, fresh and healthy. Other donair places are questionable. Their presentation is beautiful every single time and they don't cheap out on filling your plate. Every Time I go I have a constant smile on my face because it's a bunch of friendly hard working people who aren't being cheap and giving you fresh, tasty home style food at a great cost. I highly highly recommend this store and can easily give this the title of best Mediterranean food in this city. I wish them tons of luck and success because they deserve it with this master piece."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and decided to stop by here and I'm glad I did, this place is fantastic, everyone is friendly and genuine. The decor is modern and clean. I had the Shawarma plate and it's one of the best I've ever had. The rice was was flavourable, vegetables fresh, the chicken had good taste and the quantity was just perfect, reasonable prices. Check them out and enjoy the food!!"}
{"text":"i found Jerusalem to be a step above most of the other shawarma type places. Walked by many times thinking another run-of-the mill place, until, as a spur of the moment thing, I popped in with a friend and we were both really pleasantly surprised. Very fresh! very reasonable pricing and decent portions! and pleasant staff. Simple, but very clean. A few tables and a counter space for seating. Recommend in a pinch, even though there is another shawarma place 2 or so blocks away, no comparison."}
{"text":"This is my new place. Great deals and the flavours are outstanding! More choice on sandwiches than most other places - and super friendly guys. Can't go anywhere else now!"}
{"text":"It's a place for a quick meal with full of protein. The size is really large. I like the rice and the sour cream. The price is a little bit high, but considering the size, it's fine. They have limited park place. So be careful of that if you drive a car."}
{"text":"Not only have I eaten at this place numerous times, but we often order their platters for work related events. The food is always delicious, fresh, and filling. Service has always been very friendly and polite. This is one of my favourite places in Calgary to eat. Here's a tip: sometimes I find their small pita too much for what I'm hungry for, so I order a kids size-I'm not sure if it's on the menu but it is a little bit smaller if you're hungry but maybe not hangry :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Shawarma!!!! I had enjoyed shawarma and falafels for almost 20 years.... but the combination of ingredients they put in here just takes it to a new level of enjoyment!!! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. The falafel is amazing, I get it on the mixed platter every time, and I'm a hardcore meat eater. My mouth is watering right now thinking about it. The service is fast and friendly. You can't beat the value on the portion size or quality of the food. One of my favourite places to eat."}
{"text":"Legit my fav Shawarma/middle eastern restaurant in Calgary. Its so clean, the food is good and fresh. The staff are friendly, its like a well oiled machine in there. I've been there a few times now and just had to write a review, it doesn't get any better than here. Its reasonably priced as well. And the basboosa is to die for. I'm looking forward to my next shawarma craving lol maybe tonight. Who knows! Love this place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I actually love this restaurant - food is fantastic but they need to pair with a delivery service like skip the dishes there is not enough room to eat there and we have children - we want the convenience of ordering in - you loose a lot of business with this policy. Also the policy for delivery changes every time I call  - free if $100 or $10 if at least 6 orders? Regardless families want to order not pick up."}
{"text":"Amazingly Awesome!! The food is amazing and so tastey. My taste buds had a party in my mouth its so good. You can see the rotisserie so you know everything is fresh. The staff are super friendly, inviting, and laid back. We came in 20 mins to close and we were going to take our food to go so not to hold them up from closing and they invited us to stay and told us to take our time and enjoy. We also got samples of their bac lava and it was so good (not too sweet or sticky).  We will be regulars here and bring friends with us as we just moved into the area. 
Well done.  Love the food and customer service."}
{"text":"They offer all the sauces for a perfect donair and the meat is hot and seasoned well. The regular one is HUGE, the only reason it's not 5 stars is the pita being a little too chewy."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times for their Chicken Shawarma wraps. They are generous with their fillings and the chicken has a nice level of spice. The only downside is the price point which is a little steep for a shawarma but this place is clean, quick and convenient so we will keep coming back. We also like the little baklava sample they always seem to have by the cash register."}
{"text":"Nice place, visited with the family and tried many plates from the menu, plus the samosa. I loved the garlic sauce and the fact that they have it added by default."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place! I stopped at the Macleod tr. Location after previously being underwhelmed by the cedars nearby.
They are a little more expensive than the average but portions far bigger than average and I thought the quality was quite good as well. I had a falafel plate which I could barely finish and couple others with me had the shawarma. They did half pita on top of a much larger and triangle shaped flatbread. The generous toppings exceed the pita and you end up with a pretty stuff wrap that's mostly real filling and not too much bread.

I will be back to get the Donair next time. The potatoes with it as a combo were awesome but waaaay too much for one person."}
{"text":"My friend has been telling me to try the NW location for years but it's totally out of the way for me. Finally tried this location, and now I'm wondering where it's been all my life in Calgary! I've been twice now. Everything is so fresh and delicious. The flavours are different than other Schwarma and donair places in Calgary. I read an article about it in the Calgary Herald and apparently they marinate their own meat, where as most other places get their meat from the same place. 

We tried their Chicken Schwarma plate, beef donair and a couple falafel which were crisp on the outside, tender on the inside and tasty. The portions are huge and again super super fresh!"}
{"text":"Great place to pick up good food if you are in Royal Oak. Portions are big, food tasty and service great."}
{"text":"Wow. Outstanding food. Slightly pricey, but totally worth it. I've tried most things on the menu and it's all excellent. I especially love how they consistently manage to beautifully toast the outside of their wraps. The only draw-back is this place is often packed with customers."}
{"text":"Truly exceptional beef donairs just like the other locations for this chain. Haven't tried anything else on the menu despite countless visits"}
{"text":"Can't wait to pick up kabobs tons of garlic... etc. etc...   pick up guys is a great idea for when you don't feel like going out!"}
{"text":"How this place only has 3 stars is beyond me. It is by far the best shawarma I have ever had in Calgary! I had the chicken shawarma plate - there is so much food I couldn't finish it: chicken, hummus, rice, potatoes and salad. The chicken is deliciously moist and juicy. The potatoes are perfectly crispy and seasoned. I don't tolerate garlic well, so would skip the garlic sauce on the potatoes next time. But the hummus! I am literally thinking about it daily. No other hummus could compare to this. It is so smooth and creamy and yummy that it's like buttercream. Like Buttah!!! For real! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have a had Shawarma from many places in Calgary and now, having tried Jerusalem Shawarma, they are going to be one of my go-to's!

The portions are large, a platter is more than needed for a single person. On this visit, I shared a mixed Shawarma platter with additional sides of stuffed vine leaves and falafel. The mixed platter comes with beef, chicken, rice, potatoes, fattoush salad, hummus and pita.

I found the meats wonderfully spiced and well complimented by the lightly dressed fattoush salad. The falafel were fantastic, with a lovely crunchy exterior. I found the vine leaves a little oily, but the flavour of the seasoned rice instead was great. 

Service was friendly and quick. I had to wait a few minutes for my food, but the delay was due to the fact that they were fresh frying the falafel, which I didn't mind at all."}
{"text":"Second location just opened.   They seem to be a little stumbling but I'm sure they will get thier rhythm down just like at the NW location. 

It certainly is the same place as the NW delicious and fresh.   I could eat this shawarma all day.   Now that it's closer to home I'm sure I'll be a repeat offender.

Thank you Jerusalem Shawarma for expanding your delicious flavors upon the rest of Calgary."}
{"text":"Just like the country hills location.
Everything about it makes myh mouth water.
Chicken shawarma reminds me of what you get In  the middle East.
They are super nice guys, and gals.
Always a smile.  A hello and som e chit chat."}
{"text":"I have dreams of the falafel wrap. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's one of the best things I've ever eaten! And at such a good price. I usually get the medium size and I have a hard time finishing it because it's so filling. 

  This place is vegan friendly, inexpensive, and absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"If you want a good schwarma this is the place to go. Price wise not bad. The only downside is that consistency varies especially with portion sizes. Friendly people.
Overall a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"First time trying out this fantastic restaurant. Big portion of the chicken shawarma plate and the flavour is so tasty. Staffs are all friendly. We even got 4 free baklavas for purchasing 4 shawarma plates. Prices are reasonable as well. We will definitely come back. Cant wait to try their shawarma wrap"}
{"text":"Very difficult to order on uber eats. Ordered a chicken plate and got a whole lunch of toppings i did not want."}
{"text":"When I go to a shawarma place I look for 3 things: delicious falafel, overflowing plates and unique flavours. I'm very happy to report that Jerusalem Shawarma checks all those boxes and exceeds every expectation.

Jerusalem Shawarma features one of the best falafel platters I've ever had. Not only is the falafel itself fresh delicious but the enormous platter it comes on features savoury potatoes, a unique and tasty salad, heaping piles of rice and hummus drizzled with very flavourful olive oil. 

The staff is friendly and accommodating despite some pretty big rushes at times. They never hesitate to offer you some extra pita, another spoonful of their tasty garlic and sesame sauces, or a to-go box if you can't handle all the food in one sitting. 

A vegetarian truly can't go wrong here and aside from some stinky breath after eating, there's nothing that I don't love about Jerusalem Shawarma."}
{"text":"The best! Go there right now and get the chicken shawarma plate 13.95. Prob enough food to feed two people and it is the best. Always busy but fast and friendly. The restaurant is clean and decor is really charming. I can't say enough positive things about this restaurant."}
{"text":"I usually go to Beirut on Fairview but they were closed, so I decided to try this place out. I would give it a 1.5. The shawarma was decent but it was over priced in my opinion. I ordered a chicken shawarma and a small box of 5 baklava which ended up costing $21 after tip! The baklava was SOGGY!!!! It was disgusting to bite into and all 5 pieces were absolutely drenched in the sweet sauce which made it taste disgustingly sweet. Honestly the most disgusting thing I've bought from a food vendor. Really sad that they had that out to sell. It's honestly not worth my money to go back, there are much better shawarma places for a better price."}
{"text":"I have tried Jerusalem a few times now and I really like the portions, the taste and it's fast. They are always fully staffed and are super friendly. Only thing is when the debit and visa machine asks you to tip, you feel obligated and I like too, but you do need to be serviced to tip, I felt that I have to help myself to drinks, and be called to pick up the food and to throw away my own trash, so what am I tipping for? Other than that, the food is fantastic and the garlic sauce is great, I like the shish tawook and kabob platter, comes with rice, potatoes, hummus, salad, and pita. Best Value for about $15, I will definitely make this my go to when I'm super hungry and craving Lebanese food."}
{"text":"Hooked on Hummus, that's what my family tells me, I have craving for their Hummus, the rest of the food is great, but the hummus is like no other, it's fabulous! I have tried nearly everything on the menu and it's all great, I like getting the platters as it's a huge meal and under $20, talk about value for the portion. Staff are very friendly and as I can see, they know their regulars. I go to the SW location but I see they have expanded all over, popular by demand."}
{"text":"Great falafel sandwich. Not super authentic but hit the spot. Was the size of a massive burrito. Falafel was freshly fried but the laffa was grossly missing the stretchiness of high gluten flour. But again, hit the spot. $10+ was a bit rich."}
{"text":"Delicious, visited multiple times while on vacation. Best shawarma I've ever had, really wish they had this chain open back in Florida, I'd be a frequent customer."}
{"text":"nice israeli food and  Shawarma has all diffident kinds of vegetable and meat inside. also source is tasty. rice box is also good."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma wrap and really enjoyed it! The owner suggested having rice in it, and it was quite good! You can smell what's been cooking as soon as you walk in... The shawarma roasting, and all the spices... It's lovely. The staff is friendly, and welcoming, and the service is fast. It isn't the kind of place where you'd sit for very long though - more of a place to have a quick bite or get take out. Prices are reasonable, and portions are generous. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"An unexpected find in Bloorwest village where the restaurants could use more variety.

There's already 2 other falafel joints on this strip, but this one stands out. Best value (2 dinner plates for $16, 2 sandwiches for $10) and by far the most toppings for no additional charge. Go over to Ali babas across the street and you'll see what I mean. They even have a sour mango sauce that really balances the flavours. 

Service is slightly on the slow side as they seem to cook the chicken in batches, which isn't a bad thing if you're looking for fresh. The rice on the other hand was undeniably stale (I'm thinking reheated from lunch?)

4 stars because despite its flaws it's better than 90% of falafel places in the city!"}
{"text":"Best falafel wrap I've had in Calgary. The portion was huge, service friendly and efficient and the wrap itself was crunchy and delicious. The owners are from Jerusalem and obviously know their stuff. Lovely. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their platters. My favourites are the Shish Taouk (grilled chicken breast) and the falafel platter. These platters are worth the wait.  The grilled chicken takes longer to make since it takes longer to cook the meat.  This place takes a bit longer to prepare the food but the wait is worth it. I've also called in advance for pickup and they had the food ready when I arrived. I've tried the donair before and I still prefer the donairs at Jimmy's."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, huge portions, fresh ingredients, and unique style of shawarmas. Delicious meats, falafels and hummus. Always busy and lots of patrons from their community so you can tell it's authentic. Love it!"}
{"text":"First time trying a Shawarma wrap. I had the mixed chicken and beef which was filled so full with meat and all the fixings I was unsure they'd be able to wrap it all up!!  It was expertly wrapped and crunchy on the outside (a nice surprise) with a wonderful combination of flavours on the inside. The sauces were the perfect compliment to the meat - I had only a small amount of the spicy sauce but will get  a bit more of that one next time. I also added extra hummus (stolen from my hubby's beef plate which was also very tasty) to almost every bite as it was delicious!!  So creamy and full of flavour!!  Mmmmmmm. We will definitely be back. Everyone behind the counter was friendly and helpful making the overall experience even better!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars and beyond! I  shouldn't admit how many times my boyfriend and I have eaten here but we can't get enough. The owner told us recently that we're their best customer...it's that much.  In my defense, they have a special for 2 falafel for under $7.  It's by far the best deal around! I can say without a doubt I've eaten more than 100 falafel wraps from here and it's still my go-to place, so take that as you may. Recommend, recommend, recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was good, nice ambiance and has pretty good amount of seating we went after7 pm so still busy but slowing down, no line up! 
My beef donate was not great! I found no real flavours throughout all I could taste was spiciness of donair meat, I got hummus on the side which when added gave a bit more flavour. Different kind of wrap used pretty thin It seemed to be okay but I prefer the pita!! I prefer Jimmy's hands down and so does my husband, so we will drive few extra blocks to go there! But glad I tried it.
Oh my son liked his!"}
{"text":"Well my aunt decided to take our cousin and I here for supper after I was telling her about the great reviews....well lets just say they did not disappoint  Even though it was really busy we were able to get a table.  It did not take long from the time we ordered to the time we received our food....omg were the portions huge and the taste was divine.  The food was so delicious and fresh....can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"They are the most friendly staff! So personable and caring and fun while they prepare your meals

The place is ALWAYS packed so it's hard to get a seat. People are pretty mindful though and turn tables over quickly.

The price is great and the serving sizes are way too large for this gal, but great for feeding a man tummy!

The food is delicious! Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"This was by far the most amazing food I have ever had. Everything was so fresh and flavorful. Even the presentation was incredible - I can't wait to go back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Review: dinner.

We needed a restaurant that had dairy free options and this place was highly recommended so we decided to see what the fuss was about.

Bottomline: absolutely phenomenal food. They've nailed every aspect of each dish and best of all, they offer dairy free options.

Atmosphere: this restaurant was extremely busy when we went on a Saturday night. We knew we've hit the jackpot when there was a lineup outside the restaurant in minus weather. If there is a choice, go early to avoid waiting in line. The restaurant is Subway style so you can customize your plate however you like. Service is quick and friendly.

Food: their menu is fairly small so I've had the opportunity to try most of their dishes. And I've gotta say you can't go wrong with any of them. The only critic worth mentioning is their falafels being a tad bit dry. Otherwise, meats are seasoned perfectly, sides are flavorful, salads are fresh, and sauces are light but tasty. Everything just works so well together.

Value: Very good price for the quality and quantity of food offered here. Expect to go home a happily full customer."}
{"text":"The hummus is so addictive , it should be illegal.
I can eat it with a spoon ! ( and I have )"}
{"text":"Best shawarma place in Calgary. These guys have two locations in Calgary, both are very consistent in providing the best shawarmas ever! Their Chicken Shawarma Platters are a must try. Their shawarmas taste fresh as ever. The guys who work here are always cheerful and are very passionate about the food they serve."}
{"text":"The food here is so good and the staff are friendly too. I go here often, probably every other week. I actually crave it. I've tried the shwarmas which most people get and it's decent but the shish tawouk (chicken kebab) platter is where it's at! You have to wait a little longer for it to be made because they grill the chicken for you when you order. The chicken is marinated ahead of time which gives it a really nice flavour. They give you so much rice and not enough potatoes; wish it was half and half. The garlic potatoes are delicious! Overall it's a lot of food and actually too much for me to eat in one meal but I enjoy eating the leftovers the next day!"}
{"text":"There are soooo many shawarma places in Calgary, but Jerusalem Shawarma is by far the best. Their pita is refreshingly thin and fresh. But the best part is the people who run the shop. They are kind, genuine and just hands-down lovely. 
Then, add to that the fact that they routinely donate food to causes helping Syrian refugees. 
I won't buy donairs or shawarma anyplace else. 
Thank you Jerusalem Shawarma!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a mixed shawarma from Jerusalem Shawarma. The place is very clean and nice looking. The cooks there were very polite and let me pick my own toppings as the shawarma was made. 

The 13$ price was more than fair because the shawarma tasted amazing!!! I enjoyed burping it up for the next hour after finishing. And unlike most shawarmas this one was pretty sturdy. It didn't start to get messy until the very end. 

I will definitely be back for seconds!"}
{"text":"Consistent. Super clean. Friendly staff. Large portions. Good quality food. Fast. Healthy. Free baklava. 

Chicken shawarma plate is my go to.

Watch out for the garlic sauce. It's amazing but it'll *%#× your breath right up.

Always busy so you may have to take yours to go.

Of all the locations I've tried, I think this one is the best."}
{"text":"Best shawarma / donair / donor / gyro in my life. And I'm not young when it comes to spinning meat!

Everything is very clean, fresh and seemed healthy. Perhaps organic? The hummus was fantastic and freshly made. Creamiest, tastiest hummus ever. Organic chick peas, perhaps? It was that good. No, let me amend that statement. It was better than that good. I've had organic hummus that tasted like ass compared to this place. Am I being hyperbolic? Sure. Does this place deserve it? Absolutely. Will they achieve world peace with they're pitas and falafels. Okay, that's going too far. But if any food could end all wars forever, well... you get my point. ;-)"}
{"text":"Good food and value.  Nice design and friendly staff.  They have great family platters that are huge and excellent value for the price."}
{"text":"Delicious shawarmas and Mediterranean food! I loved everything I had there! And the portions were not small at all ! I can eat there every week if I'm around the area as for me this is one of the best Mediterranean food places in the city!! I recommend this place 100%!!"}
{"text":"I terms of overall quality this place is 3-stars, pretty standard, and not any different than the many other shawarma places around the city. The extra star though is given for the construction of their wraps and the decor.

This place looks like somewhere you'd actually want to sit down and eat. They've spent some money and put some thought into the decor. Unlike many other similar restaurants in the city that have that sterile cafeteria feel to them and maybe even have questionable cleanliness, here there's nice booths and tables.

For the construction of the wrap there's an extra layer of flat bread. They have a large, very thin, outer wrap that covers the \"guts\" in an impenetrable blanket that won't let any sauce escape onto your pants. Perfect if you're grabbing a wrap to go."}
{"text":"Good food, I've had the beef shawarma and chicken shawarma and the plate versions. $15 for the plate. Food is great but for $15, the portions are small."}
{"text":"Lots of free toppings, and unlike other places the owner proudly encourages that you try his toppings which are specific to  his culture and taste very good. Nice amount of chicken and good flavour."}
{"text":"I come here all the time because their food are perfect compared to any donair place or kebob place I've been. Great tasting plates and shawarma. Worth your money too."}
{"text":"The best food for a quick, filling and healthier choice to eat. Each time I come to Calgary I go here. You got to because it's just so tasty and delicious and clean. Friendly staff and pretty seating. Easy to get it to go as well. Mmmm shawarma"}
{"text":"I find the business worst in customer service. I entered the Shawnessy location at 947 and only thing employees wanted to do was leave and they said you will get good at Mcleaod outlet. K drive to Mclead and was there at 10 pm sharp and the manager said they not going to deliver. Only thing I witnessed was that employees used me as ping pong ball to get out of businesses sooner than later. Not again."}
{"text":"We normally go to the Country Hills location, but we were in the area and remembered that a new shop opened up here. There is nothing we can say wrong about this place. Had the medium Falafel Wrap & Beef Shawarma Wrap. Filling was perfect and plentiful. Taste, awesome! Service was also spot on, from taking your order to paying. Another nice gesture was when we were leaving, they acknowledged our departure with a Thank you and good bye! We will definitely make a trip back. Thank you for the service & meal!"}
{"text":"Oh boy!  Jerusalem Shawarma is now in the NW in Royal Oak.  It's located right beside Planet Organics Market.  Parking space is limited.  The restaurant is much smaller than the 16 Ave NW location.  There are 5 booths for a max of 4 people and a bigger booth that seats about 6 people in the corner.  

As you enter the restaurant, you see the open kitchen where the food is prepared.  I was a bit confused as to what to do at first.  Here's what you do: you order first as you go in, then pay at the end.  We ordered the Falalfel Wrap (9\") - enough to feed 2 people!  It was declicious and warm and their falafel is a lovely green colour!  The tahini sauce ties the whole warp together with the crunchy fresh vegetables.  We also ordered the Beef Shawarma Plate - comes with beef shawarma, hummus, fatouch salad(our choice), garlic potatoes that are out of this world with that garlic sauce, and a bed of rice.  Big platter for big stomachs!  Enough to feed 2 people.  We decided to add on a small falafel appy (6 falafel balls) with tahini sauce.  So warm and yummy!

People are streaming in and out of the restaurant, either to stay to eat or most of them were take-outs.  Check out their menu; they even have family-sized platters to feed up to 5 people!!  

Very polite and considerate customer service.  Don't forget the free baklava by the cashier.  Yes, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food in a nice little cafeteria-style restaurant.  There are a few parking spots. Just be mindful when you order, the portions are huge!  

We ordered:
- Chicken Shawarma Plate
- Beef Donair Plate
Both of the plates were loaded with basmati rice, salad, garlic potatoes with sour cream, load of chicken or donair meat all over the plate with tahini sauce and hot sauce.
- Falafel Wrap - Medium - was quite a large portion.  I can only imagine what the Large might be! I love the falafel is so fresh.  It's interesting to watch them do the wrap.  They put vegetables, falafel, tahnini sauce, hot sauce, on a pita but they wrap up with another thin saje bread and all toasted up.  Very, very tasty!
- Chicken Sharwarma Wrap - Medium - ditto as above.  Delicious wrap!
- Samosas - beef and chicken - quite tasty with a hint of heat.

There were also free samples of date squares. Not too sweet, just nice.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"WOW. I love this place. Fresh and tasty. My daughter said it's the first place she has seen where there is more food than in the menu photos. Such good food for the price.
We are coming back net time we go to the movies."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars.  

I have always had a soft spot for Jerusalem Shawarma, since they opened their first location in Country hills I have visited each location as they opened and although they are all pretty consistent this one holds a special place in my heart.  Royal Oak is a close second.  I have stopped going in to the country hills landing location because it is just too small and seldom find seating during the rush, the staff there with exception to the tall manager there are not on their game and find the portions there are actually smaller.  They don't cram the same amount of meat as the other locations do in it their wraps here.   I will drive out of my way to 16th Ave. to get my shawarma fix.

Centrally located, same group of guys running it and same top notch quality food. Every. Single. Time.  They are so generous and always have the platters flowing abundantly, easily enough food to serve 2 people.  Yes, the skewers do take 15-20 min longer than the meats on the spit but you can call in and pre-order!  There were one or two instances where there was some miscommunication with the phone order vs. when I got there but they took care of things efficiently and the free baklava always helps :)  The guys there know us now and always remember us and our order, some friendly conversation and and good vibes is always welcome.  

Love the hummus, love the potatoes, love the garlic sauce.  Yes, there may be slight differences in the food from location to location but generally overall, this one remains the most consistent among the other locations, word on the street is they may have a south location in the works. 

The only negative and reason they don't get a 5 star was bc the music was really loud and top 40,  (some traditional Arabic music would be more suited here), garlic sauce although good has been tweaked and not as pungent as it once was and their fatoush dressing needs to be adjusted, it does not taste like a traditional fatoush but it's still pretty good and for about $14, its the best lunch value out there."}
{"text":"1. The restaurant is nice and clean...flip side the floor is very slippery needs to be very careful

2. The portions are big. Which is good...thf price ranges from 10 to 17 bucks Canadian.

3. When you order make sure you say wrap or platter. My friend wanted a wrap and got a platter. Hence the 3 stars

4. The garlic sauce that comes with the potatoes are so good...if your not a garlic fun ....then u won't like it. But if you are....heaven!"}
{"text":"OMG! It is so good. It is fantastic, it is the best in the city! 
And even after a night in the fridge it still tastes good. Also try their pakhlava, it is authentic, you will love it. 
The only minus in this place is that it is quite small. If it is lunch hour there will be no tables and you will have to take out."}
