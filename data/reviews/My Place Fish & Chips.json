{"text":"I love this place, it really reminds me old school real fish and chips! The batter is simply nostalgic, the fries are fresh cut, gravy is good and the place keeps it real! The decor is not so great up it is what it is!"}
{"text":"We went after Good Friday mass, usually,  a very time for any fish and chips place.  Despite being busy the food and service were exceptional. I had the haddock platter,  great price $15.00 it included two scallops,  4 shrimp a large piece of haddock and chips. Make sure you get the gravy it's a perfect pairing...  Great place"}
{"text":"I'm very picky with fish and chips, however this place is amazing!!!!!! The fish is very crispy, not oily and tastes very fresh. I work around the corner, so it's great place for a nice meal for lunch.  Can easily do lunch with a drink for well under $15!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in North York. Not greasy at all. Service is quick and polite. Nice comfort food."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips place! Really friendly owners and staff but the seats inside and such are a little outdated. Will still definitely go and how much your getting for what you pay is fantastic !"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after finding out my fave hakka restaurant next door closed down.  Seemed like a cute mom & pop shop, but someone should've warned me of the misery that was going to happen from the food.  I contracted severe food poisoning & stomach flu from ordering the Halibut and chips.  It was the combination of the cooking oil and the fish itself (was not fresh & had a weird aftertaste).  I left the restaurant with the same odd aftertaste in my mouth from the oil.  When I got home I started feeling nauseous and immediately threw up again with a combination of poop smoothie. The following 4 days involved flushing out whatever was left of my meal & remaining toxins that were in my body.  I ended up wasting my weekend & had to wfh in order to recover from this ordeal.  Save yourself from spending your next few days on a toilet seat & pick another place to eat."}
{"text":"Good fish and chips, I always get their lunch special.  Grouper fish and chips for $6.25 as of March 29th 2018.  The decor is a little old but their food is always solid.  Their halibut and chips is also good but costs more at $11.50"}
{"text":"Pleasant owners and reasonable pricing (lower than most other fish and chips spots in the area). Batter is a bit on the thicker side, and doesn't quite have that satisfying crisp shatter that I'd hoped for.  Some of my fries were still a bit raw on the inside.  But we also came in at 20 minutes to closing time, so I can't really blame them as the fryer was probably no longer as hot.  Lunch specials featuring cheaper, white fish such as grouper seem to be really good deals, so I might come back and try those sometime!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at My Place dozens of times over the years, but it's been quite a while since I've been there. This is for no other reason than convenience, as I've relatively recently relocated, and so this isn't any longer as close by as it used to be. Feeling nostalgic though, a couple of friends and I decided we had to make the drive to get our fish and chips fix, and I'm very glad we did.  First off, the staff here are great. The same family has been running this place for years, and even though it's been quite some time since we'd been here, they greeted us like long lost friends, and made every effort to make us feel welcome.  The food itself is still really good. In all honesty, I'd say my fish was a tiny bit over cooked, but it was still delicious, and it still had the same light and flaky batter I remember. And the fries were just how I like them. Thick cut, and cooked perfectly.  I'm not a tartar sauce user, but one of my friends loves the stuff, and since last time we were here the staff have started making their own. They still carry the packaged stuff, so anyone can use whatever their preference is, but try both if that's your thing. Apparently they are both very different.  The only thing I find a little difficult about coming here is the parking. Nothing to do with the restaurant, but frustrating nonetheless. They're located in a busy little plaza, with 4 other restaurants, a salon, a bank, and a few other businesses. And for all of them there are only about 70 parking spaces. Be patient and you'll get a spot; but it can take some time and a good eye."}
{"text":"was in the mood for fish n chips.  came across this place since we happen to be in the area.  At the time of our visit, the staff on hand were quite attentive.  Seems to also be a tad cheaper than other fish n chip restos.  Wife and I shared a chef salad and the Haddock Platter.  We were satisfied with our meal.  I enjoyed the shrimps and scallops, wife really liked the haddock.  Our only irk, was the tartar sauce we in packets and not made in house or at least bottled.  Worth it for repeat visits."}
{"text":"A place close to work...perfect when I need Fish and Chips.  Place is own by Asians and price is same as others.  A halibut and chips with pop is roughly $12.00 something.  To me, it's really A-OK.  Nothing special but close to work.  A little stingy on tartar sauce.  They serve them in packets and start with 2 per person.  Constantly asking for more cause they give 1 per person.  They serve Canadian beers (Bud, Canadian, and etc).  There's sweets at cashier for additional cost.  It's a family business that mother, father, daughter, and son that manages place.  Kitchen is open concept.  Small parking lot because it's a rundown plaza."}
{"text":"Lunch special is $5.75 for Alaskan whitefish+chips, which is less than half the price of their standard haddock/halibut and chips. It's not very good, as the whitefish is thin and not firm. You taste more of the batter than the fish. You get what you pay for.  But the halibut+chips ($12.50) is very good. It's only a dollar more than the haddock+chips, and it's definitely worth the premium. Batter leans on the salty side, and I prefer the more neutral batter at Len Duckworth's. But the halibut is of a nice thickness and keeps its distinct flavor. Don't slather it with tartar sauce or malt vinegar."}
{"text":"This place knows how to make their fish and chips!! Ive been to this place 3 times now and it just keeps getting better!! Got the family pack with 4 halibut, fries and gravy. Just writing this review makes me want to go back. Great place!"}
{"text":"My third time here  Great food, great service, old school diner feel Makes me feel at home."}
{"text":"Really a great place for fish and chips. The batter is crispy but not oily. The fish is perfectly seasoned and the flesh has a great consistency. The fries are fine but I really preferred their onion rings. They were also crunchy and flavorful.  The ambience feels very cosy and the decorations will transport you to the U.K. This is a small restaurant managed by a friendly staff. If you're searching for a local fish and chips place, you'll be hard pressed to find better."}
{"text":"The *BEST* Halibut dinner in Toronto! I've been coming to this place for probably as long as they've been around, EXCELLENT food, service, prices friendly atmosphere  Also excellent Haddock, atlantic whitefish, everything on the menu Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on a monday weekday. it is an older quaint family restaurant. the interior looks much like. so i went for their lunch special fish and chips. since this was their specialty. it is a good deal, as it is around 6 bucks after tax. The restaurant interior is one of old school diner style, so there is some comfort in that  The Fish for this restuarant is not bad. however the sheer volume of oil for the fried fish and chips. is intense. I think overall the taste is fine, except that afterwards i think it was just too much oil to take in. so i would suggest anyone to get a napkin or something and place it over the fish first to suck up the oil. overall the the taste is pretty decent.   The fries that came with the place. was not very flavourful. it was bland, i suppose the point was that it was to match the fish since the fish is very much oily and heavy tasting.   Overall, for the price it was a decent meal, and the portions was good. it was not the best fish and chips i have ever found, but if your around the area and have a craving it could be a good place to go since it is affordable."}
{"text":"Got the lunch special, grouper + fries for $5.50. Got a huge portion but the fish had a very soft and mushy texture just like basa. However, the waitress confirms the fish is grouper."}
{"text":"4 stars go to the halibut and chips I had the other day.  Lightly battered and evenly coated to perfection; devoured alone.  Chips were ok.   I truly respect the fact that they have the option  for fish and few chips.  Smaller portions should be an option on every menu!  This place has a very homey type of feel.    The red wine I tried could have been a little better. That's all."}
{"text":"Consistent and delicious fried halibut with tartar sauce.  I am not a fan of the old school styled fries though but they are fresh :)"}
{"text":"We use to come to this place on a regular basis but haven't been in quite a while.  First off there appears to be a change in ownership or at least in operations.  We had both the halibut and haddock with chips. The good - the batter and the chips were crispy - not overly oily. The bad - the portion of halibut was thin and small compared to other places. The haddock was larger and better value at a buck less. Both fish though were over cooked and dry.  What I did find was an unpleasant 'herb' after taste to the meal - almost like I had eaten parsley even though there was none in the meal.  All in all not a pleasant meal."}
{"text":"I am a semi regular at this location. Yesterday was my last visit. It was not good. So bad that i asked if there was new ownership as i didn't recognize anyone there(weird). I was told that it's under same ownership. Well when the cat's away the mice will play. My fish was full of brown veins and tasted very fishy. We are talking about Halibut here people. My batter was thick unlike the fish and super greasy. Sorry to tell you , I wont be back."}
{"text":"Light crispy batter with flaky fish and old school type French fries. You can't go wrong./"}
{"text":"It's crispy and juicy!  My lunch special had more batter than fish. I would give it 4 stars if the thickness of the fish was a little more generous.   For $5.50 + tax, you can't complain too much."}
{"text":"Easily the best fish and chips in Toronto. Thin crispy batter over perfectly cooked haddock or halibut. The scallops and shrimp are amazing as well. This is a family run business with family business hours-closed at 9pm, and Sundays. Open for lunches with beer and wine licence. Typical suburban decor with  lots of tables where you can watch the chef work his magic. Clean and fast service anytime, and take out is available in under 15 minutes. My absolute favourite go to fish and chip shop in the city."}
{"text":"Our favourite fish & chips shop in north Scarborough. Pricing is on par with other fish & chip places, but you know it's good value when all the pensioners hang out there!  Tip 1: Eat in store. It's always better than after travel time getting home as a take-away.  Tip 2: Try the Scottish bread they have for sale from time to time."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch of fish and chips at reasonable price. I agree that they should have bottles of tartar sauce as the packets are a pain. i dropped my digital camera there and they were kind enough to hold it and return when I called them to ask if it was found."}
{"text":"Greasy overcooked fish Seriously tartar sauce from a package? Where's the lemon slice"}
{"text":"This place seems like a family-run business - which I can usually get behind!  The menu has 3 types of fish, shrimp, and scallops. Maybe a few other things, but bottom line is super yummy. Waitress/server/owner(?) was really friendly and willing to explain the fish options.  Great price and you can opt for a fewer amount of chips."}
{"text":"This place serves fish and chips.   When you walk in,  you'll see a lot of old memorabilias.   I heard that it used to be run by a white family and they retired so now a chinese family runs this place.     If you want to try this place at a reasonable price,  you must get their lunch special.   The batter is perfectly crusted and it comes with fries.   They will also give you packets of tartar sauce to use when you eat your filet.  The place is old but that's the charm of it.   You are transformed into being on a seaside nova scotia restaurant in the heart of toronto.   You will find a lot of old seniors here eating their fish and chips."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with great fish and chips. The halibut and haddock are perfectly cooked, with a very nice light flakey batter.  Only confusing and what i think is unnecessary is that there is a $.30 different between fish and chips and fish and few chips.  Kind of unnecessary in my opinion.  Also, if this place made their own tartar sauce it'd get 5 stars.  Sadly, it hands them out it the small packets.  Sort of ruins a great piece of breaded fish.  Please, please make your own tartar sauce.  It couldn't be that difficult"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended and so I was keen to try it.  I finally made it in for lunch today.  This is a great family run business and the owners were very courteous and friendly.   Service was excellent as well.   I ordered the haddock and black pudding and I have to say both were delicious. The batter was light and crispy. The haddock was tasty and so was the black pudding. Portion sizes were also decent - I walked away feeling very full.   This was a great experience - yummy food in a family friendly atmosphere. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Wow, these guys know what is what and that what is fish and chips.   Went there on good Friday and of course there was a long lineup. Waited for pickup for about 40 min, which is normal for good Friday. It was still worth the wait. Staff was very happy and busy and tried to make everyone happy even though there was a lot of everyones.   Will come here again, and again."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars This review is mainly for the lunch special. I got it for take-out and when I opened my paper bag of fish and chips, I was pleasantly surprised at 2 large pieces of fish and lots of chips (fries). The first few bites were absolutely amazing. Salty, crispy, batter...MMM MMM goooood. However, after I've finished about 3/4 of my first piece of fish, I got kind of sick of eating batter. There really wasn't very much fish; it was a thin fillet with a thick shell of batter. Then again, you're only paying a little over $6 so at that price, it's alright. No substitutions allowed for the lunch special.   Ambiance: 3 stars Diner layout. Simple and maybe ever so slightly dingy? Old-fashioned in a cute way. Mixed feelings about the place to be honest.  Service: 3 stars Got take-out but the the waitress/cashier & cooks were very nice."}
{"text":"I'll be the first to admit - I don't visit fish & chips places very often because of the deep fried nature but now, when I have a craving this is THE spot to visit.  In fact, I've been to this restaurant more times this year (5 times) than I've been to any fish & chips my whole life.    The batter on the fish is nice and light, crunchy and the oil is CLEAN.  The fish comes out a perfect golden light yellow colour and one bite into it releases all the hidden flavours of the fish.    They serve haddock and halibut and both are excellent choices and not super greasy.  The chips are old style french fries and serves its purpose as the super sidekick to the fish."}
{"text":"EEEKKK. I have a second opinion about the 4 star food everyone seem to rave about.  Halibut is usually the most expensive type of fish most places offer so you would expect to pay top dollars for quality (even if its only 12$) . I was really happy when they placed 2 pieces of fried fish on my plate. But soon disappointed when I discovered 70% of each piece is batter and fish itself merely thicker than a piece of paper.   I am disappointed knowing this is supposed to be a fish and chips chain.."}
{"text":"Food 4/5 - ok Fish&Chips Price 5/5 - $5.50 for lunch Service 5/5 - friendly, quick, respectful, cards taking. Location 5/5 - near 401  Will be back!"}
{"text":"You know it's gonna be good when you walk in and most of the clientele are Irish pensioners. They wouldn't spend a dime on bad food.  Family run business, the mother of the joint is friendly, helpful and honest. We tried to combo up a meal, and she recommended a different combo that was cheaper, but had what we wanted.  The food (of course!) - oddly enough, they do tartar sauce in those little packets. Why? Maybe they just don't have the manpower and time to make their own. But the chips are the nice, fat French fries that go so well wi vinegar (malt or not, your choice). The fish!! I got the halibut and the best part about a good fish & chips joint is when you know that their oil hasn't been used for 6 months without changing, the batter is light and there isn't a greasy aftertaste. That's exactly how my fish turned out - light and crispy, thinly battered... It's moderate pricing for what you get, but it's definitely my staple fish & chips joint."}
{"text":"My fave fish and chips place!  I've tried tried a couple of places in Toronto but this one for me has been the best.  The crowd here generally is seniors.  Food and service is great.  I always get halibut for fish and chips.  They make it nice and crispy, tastes fresh, and not too oily.  The chips r fresh and filling.  Halibut fish sandwich is good too.  My friends enjoyed the food too when I take them.  I wish they would have bottles of tar tar sauce instead of packets.  Oh well, at least they don't charge extra for tartar sauce, unlike a lot of other retarded places."}
{"text":"I was in that area for a meeting and came across this place. Fairly good review on YELP.  My assessment: Not good, not bad. The price is cheap though. 2 pieces of halibut on top of a bunch of ok chips. Tartar sauce came from individual packages. This is a no, no in my book. I suspect the current owners are merely using the recipes that were passed to them from the previous owner."}
{"text":"This place is amazing with their $5.50 lunch special that includes fish and chips!!! It was definitely worth it! No regret after eating the fully battered fish and a basket of fries. I don't think I have any negative things to say about this chain. Take out takes a while to make so I would recommend ordering through the phone. As well as they have a wall full of tapestry that is great to read!"}
{"text":"This place is an old Scottish themed fish and chips restaurant, the owners are Chinese, they bought the place from the previous owner about 10 years ago. They service is really nice and the owner is always happy to explain about the difference between the fish. I always get halibut and haddock mixed up, I like the less Fisher tasting one. They have two sizes for the fish and that makes it easier for us to tell which fish we are eatting, apparently I like the longer fillet :) so so this makes it so much easier for me to order the fish I like. The meal comes with a nice little garden salad :) it's refreshing compared to the coleslaw must places give, additionally, they only have tartar sauce packet, but I'm not complaining. I always get the fish I like here, no confusion and I always Lester something new :) they have this weird soda that was import, it's like fanta but not quite the same, the owner suggested in misread of my standard coke with my meal and it was really good :) always love the surprise here. Dinner is quite busy, tables are always mostly full and there is alot of people getting take out. They have a lunch special for Alaska fish fillet, I tried it once, it wasn't as good as the haddock, it was alot more watery but the price difference is like 1/2 so you can see why the fish wasn't as good :) but i still enjoyed it :) it's a great place to go for fish and chips :) no confusion and great service!"}
