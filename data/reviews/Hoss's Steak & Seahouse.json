{"text":"I not been at a Hoss for many years so when I saw one near hotel my trip to Pittsburg I decided to eat there. The food was typical of these kind restaurant. Service was OK. This location wasn't as clean as I think it should be."}
{"text":"We would go to the one in Moon Township often !!!   We even had a Family Gathering there food and service was always good !!  Maybe one day it will return to the airport area  !!!"}
{"text":"This was not a very good dining experience at all.  For starters all of the lettuce on the salad bar was swimming in a pool of water, so I asked our waiter if they had other lettuce.  When the other lettuce was presented it also was saturated.  The entr√©es were lack luster. It was too bad because we have enjoyed meals at other Hoss's locations before."}
{"text":"Annnnd its closed. These five stars are for the memories and the hope one day they will bring it out of the cryogenic restaurant vault and give it life again."}
