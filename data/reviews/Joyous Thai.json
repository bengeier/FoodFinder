{"text":"Relatively new place in Royal York plaza.  Mix of Chinese and Thai food on the menu.  Food is a step above standard Chinese or Thai take out.  Dining room is large but usually not busy.  We have ordered several times from here and enjoyed the food.  Staff is friendly and service is usually prompt.  We prefer this place to the other local Asian food options in the area."}
{"text":"awful! got the pad thai and cold rolls. cold rolls were ok but not great. pad thai was flavorless and disgusting. noodles were bright orange...?"}
{"text":"Spacious dining area.  Decent job with service (bringing us water, helping with putting our items in takeout containers, etc.) The crispy beef was delicious. My green curry chicken had undercooked chicken. This is utterly unacceptable."}
{"text":"I came here for take out because hubby wanted something quick that wasn't pizza.  So, ya.  I ordered golden curry chicken and pad thai.  The pad thai was ok, but really red, not so authentic and a bit ketchup-y.  I had take out but the sit down restaurant looked pretty reasonable and clean. The staff wasn't so attentive but it might have been because there weren't many people there, so sometimes you need more people to get your groove on.  I digress.  The golden curry was also ok.  It's a nice change from pizza, but it's not the best thai food i ever had."}
{"text":"I was so excited about this place then so disappointed!  Everything was way overpriced for poor quality food. Singapore noodles was watery!! What a waste of space. Wait staff was NOT friendly even though only 1 table was occupied. Should have known better."}
{"text":"I ordered a bunch of food from Joyous Thai from uber eats and honestly, it was pretty good; it's good that home made from mom feeling when you eat it.  My friend and I got the deep fried calamari which had some spicy/salty toppings on it which is typical for asians, red curry with chicken + vegetables which was creamy and delish. We also got shrimp rolls which he liked, but as a south East Asian gal, i know these aren't the real deal; these were slightly burnt and just too thick for my liking. The mango chicken was deep fried pieces of chicken with mangoes, veggies and a sauce. We also got coconut rice to go along with our food and I was pretty excited about this ahaha- so simple but so good!  All the portions were large- had them for leftovers the next day and still good!! Good food and worth it's price."}
{"text":"I ordered the coconut rice and coconut cashew veggies through Ubereats and everything was delicious. This is my first time ordering from here and I was happy with the food. I'd try them out again."}
