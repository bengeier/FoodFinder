{"text":"Ahhh Man..I hate doing this but I think it warrants a post. 

Me as I am ordering: :D 
Me as I look and taste my order: D:

I ordered the Pad Thai and there were barely any noodles, tofu or sauce. It has no flavor and the noodles were cold :( What made it even worse is I paid $10 for this when I could have paid that amount for the top Thai Restaurants in Calgary (shout out to White Elephant and Juree's WOOT WOOT).

I wouldn't recommend Yummi Yogis due to the quality and cost."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for a general audience, 4 for vegetarians. A gluten free menu today with two salads, fancy drinks, and desserts. The taco salad had a hemp heart \"meat\" with a good texture, but could have used a some more spices like cumin to give it a more Mexican feel. The salad had a nice variety of carefully cut fresh veg, and was topped with pretty edible flowers. The baked tortilla strips had a good crunch without being heavy.  A bit more yoghurt would have been appreciated. If you're looking for a nicely presented salad, Yummi Yogis does a pretty good job.  More seasoning and the addition to the menu of a vegetarian or vegan main that isn't a salad (even just a hearty soup) would probably bump this up to 4 stars, based on their sincere effort to make healthy food attractive and tasty too."}
{"text":"So this food truck is composed of rich healthy eats.  I scrumptiously had their pulled pork and noodle dish.  The drink could be a bit stronger but I probably just like extra spice.  Calgary needs more healthy healthy food truck options this is a great choice if in your area.  May not operate in winter"}
{"text":"Pick something. Anything. The whole menu will blow your mind with how delicious and lovingly crafted their food is. The Almond Pad Thai is a home run."}
{"text":"Yummi Yogis is a refreshing alternative to the health conscious in a sea of food truck options that are available. Their friendly staff emits \"hippie like vibes\" and they offer generous portions that you might be able to share with a partner if you're looking for a light snack. I would strongly recommend their almond based pad thai!"}
