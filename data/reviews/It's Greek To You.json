{"text":"I've been here for lunch a couple of times and have gotten the greek salad with both chicken/gyro meat.  Everything's been really fresh both times. The portions are also quite large. It's definitely a breath of fresh air compared to the other chinese/fast food places down stairs."}
{"text":"We recently had lunch there. Ordered the greek salad with chicken. The meat was very dry, the salad felt \"old\"... I wondered how one can mess up a greek salad so badly."}
{"text":"Worst food I've had in a while and it definitely is not an even slightly decent representation of Greek food. I ordered the Spanakopita with a Greek salad. Spanakopita is supposed to be crispy and this one was not. It was soggy. I've also never seen Spanakopita stuffed with rice. this is really cheap of this restaurant. They stuff it with rice to make it seem fuller. The Spinach also tasted old. The salad was average but the Feta cheese on it was not a good quality at all. This place lacks variety and quality. I know it's a fast food Greek place but it's not very cheap either so they should either cut down the price or serve better quality that's actually edible. Also, they should clean the dining area better, it kind of smells funky and look grimy. Avoid eating here!!"}
{"text":"Came here out of convenience as I was staying at a hotel connected to the mall. I love Greek food but this was one of the worst. I ordered the falafel plate and besides the falafel being dry and over seasoned the plate had ONE....ONE falafel on it. There was nobody there at noon on a Tuesday. Pass on this place!  There are so many Mediterranean spots nearby. I should have gone elsewhere. In a positive note: the service was very good and staff was friendly. I wish it could have have better with the food...a lot better."}
{"text":"This is located on the 2nd floor of Tower city.  I had a chicken gyro combo that came with fries and a salad. The salad was ok but I had a few pieces that were brown. Just picked those out and moved along. The fries were fresh cut and he had just pulled them out of the fryer, literally dumped it in the container. Would have been nice to have them drained an extra minute because my salad deep fryer oil on it. The chicken gyro was so good! 100% ate that and threw out the rest.  7.99 for that so pretty decent. Would have given a 5, but the fries and salad kinda ruined it. The guys that work there are great as well. Friendly and the tables and floor were cleaned!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today.  I ordered the Chicken Philly Wrap and it was pretty good!  The wrap was large, but it didn't have a lot of meat.  I had a side of pasta salad and that was okay.  They have a lot of vegetarian dishes for you rabbits out there.    This restaurant is located upstairs the food court in the crumbling, vibrating, Tower City food court.  Buses driving over my head while I'm eating is very unnerving."}
{"text":"Ten of us arrived unannounced, and the counter people were ready. The menu items were on display which helped us choose quickly.  The gyro meat was perfect with the cucumber-yogurt sauce. The salads were huge. We were served quickly, and everyone liked their lunch. Tables, booths and stools along the window gave seating to everyone, and for some, a view of the river. This place was perfect for us. Was not the typical mall food court or bar food. Much better. Lunch can be had for under $10."}
{"text":"After being accosted by the Chinese food samples downstairs, we headed upstairs to a quiet oasis of Greek food.   We ordered a gyro and falafal and split the fries.  The falafal wasn't too try, was homemade tasting and had good flavor.  The gyro was stuffed with meat.  I also (after recently having some HORRIBLE taziki sauce lately), was very pleased with the cucumber flavor of their taziki/gyro sauce.  The owner was chatty, discussing with people behind me on how he has a family franchise.  I can understand why, they were quick, didn't skimp, and in general provided very good food court food."}
