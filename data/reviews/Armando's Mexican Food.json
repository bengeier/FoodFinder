{"text":"Great food and very affordable prices!  Had the carnitas burrito and rolled tacos.  Everything was fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"There was a big black bug on top of my wife's rolled tacos. Very disappointed and won't be using this location again."}
{"text":"Super slow drive thru and they don't answer the phone for call ahead service! Always filthy tables"}
{"text":"Luis is the best cook ever! Love the food here. The resturant is always clean and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"2 tacos over $7.00 Taste was fair But cheap corn tortillas made them to messy to enjoy.. Place is filthy.. After a couple visits no more...!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here since it has opened, and I think it's one of the best drive through Mexican food you can get. If you don't mind a little mix up every so often and people not being able to repeat back everything you just ordered (which I don't) you're good. Overall it's a great place to get some quick authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Since there were no reviews and the place just opened, we went there ready for anything. It isn't a sit down, you order at a counter like a fast food place and they bring the food to you.   I'm giving it two stars because it is clean. It is so new it isn't decorated on the walls but that doesn't affect my rating.   The service was OK but the problem is the food. One of us had the soft carne asado tacos (they give you 2) for $8 and the carne was dry. The flavor was OK but the value wasn't there. The refried beans were horrible and the rice was dry. The other person couldn't resist the urge to try the chile relle√±o burrito-yes, that's right, a burrito. It was a much better value than the tacos (tab was under five bucks including tax) and was a lot better than the carne asado tacos. We wished they chopped up the chile into bite size pieces because a bite brought out this large pepper and it was hard to eat gracefully-it looked like someone was smoking a pepper cigar. The burrito was filling but the $8 tacos left us hungry.  The kicker is that they have a drive-up window and they do make the food to order. We were half way through our meal when a red truck drove up to the drive-up. We finished and left and the truck was still there. I wouldn't want to order when there was anyone in front of me in the drive-up.  For the money, go to Rubio's (a chain). There was no condiment bar like they have at Rubio's and the value is better there.  They better get the kinks out or it will be another flash in the pan."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and thought I would give this place a try. Not to bad. I ate here twice before writing this review. My first time I had the one of my favorite dishes, the cabeza tacos. They were nothing special. No extra tortilla, most places give you two per taco to soak up the juice. These just fell apart, but I did not really mind that much. Cabeza I a fatty meat which I love but the fat on these seemed under cooked but the meat itself was cooked fine (How they accomplished this is a mystery to me) At least they serve cabeza because not all mexican food places serve it. The second time I had the rolled tacos with guacamole. These were average but their guacamole was better than some places, there was actually some pieces of avocado in there and not just some \"guacamole sauce\" like you find at Filibertos. I would still recommend this place if you are looking for average fast food Mexican."}
{"text":"Well... still in the drive thru (25 min) and still no food... not joking 25 minutes.... so just remember the drive through window is for those who chose to dine in the car. Update... Oh... and my order was wrong. (Management can check the camera 4/22/17 from 5:36pm to 6:08pm)"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Armando's given I live north of it and there is little to no taquerias to be found.  It is a very solid taqueria-style experience.  As noted, the location and exterior are a little sketchy, but inside it is much nicer and cleaner than one would expect.  The service is fairly friendly and they are quick enough to have a drive-thru.  As for the food, the focus is on burritos, tacos and tortas.  They also do plates, sides and soups.  I can tell you that for the most part, I have done the burritos.  In fact, I've had one of every kind on the menu (and there are quite a few).  As for the lunch/dinner burritos, my favorites are the chicken and green chile (also the cheapest at about $3.50).  No rice with these, just meat and lots of it.  The green chile, by the way, is a carnitas burrito with some salsa verde.  Again, both are very good.  Additionally, I do like the shrimp and adobada burritos. A little more money, but still tasty.  Lastly, it may not be for everyone, but the cabeza burrito is very good as well.  If I had to say the one that maybe isn't as great as the others, it would be the California burrito.  Just not as tasty as some you might find.  All of the breakfast burritos are pretty good as well.  They do the eggs on the flattop, so they are very cooked.  Some say overcooked or burnt, however, I think they work well.  Surprisingly, my favorite is the A La Mexicana, which is just eggs, peppers, onions, and tomatoes.  No meat in this one.  All are pretty good burritos though.  Definitely worth a try.  As for the rest of the menu, I've had the carne asada tacos, rolled tacos and a couple of the tortas.  The carne asada tacos are not the best I've had.  In fact, I'd say they are just ok.  The rolled tacos are tasty enough.  The tortas are good as well and worth a try as well.  Again, this place is not the absolute best or most authentic taqueria you will find, but it is more than serviceable and quite good at some things.  I have also visited the South Phoenix location on 7th Street and it is and tastes a lot the same.  Give it a try.  Will guarantee you like something and not spend a ton."}
{"text":"They serve Pepsi.  Got horribly sick about 30 minutes after I finished my meal."}
{"text":"Check your food before you leave the drive-up!!! I've been going to this restaurant regularly for over 5 years and can count on one hand how many times they have gotten my order right.  This is the only restaurant I've ever frequented that I have to literally open up the bag, pull out by burrito, unwrap it, and peel open the tortilla to MAKE SURE it is what right!  Unfortunately, they make it wrong 90% of the time and end up having to make it again.  You would think a small business would get tired of throwing away food because it was made incorrectly, but you would be WRONG.  On one occasion I didn't  check it before driving home and found out it was wrong so I drove all the way back to have it made correctly;  they made it again and STILL SCREWED UP MY ORDER!   The food is very good and a decent value.  However, the frustration of dozens and dozens of screwed up orders, coupled with a very dangerous location where you are approached by panhandlers WHILE WAITING IN YOUR CAR in the drive-up, has left me as an ex-customer of Armandos.  Never again will they screw up burrito!  Is it really rocket science to make a frickin' burrito with ONLY CARNE ASADA AND CHEESE AND NOTHING ELSE???"}
{"text":"Love that this place is close by my work! I always come for the rolled tacos! I like to get it with some tomatoes on the side and also you can never forget to ask for the spicy carrots!"}
{"text":"\"Oh god. No, not again. Please, lord, if you stop making butt pee come out of my backside as a result of eating Armando's, I will build several churches in your honor, I'll give up porn, I will abstain from using obscenities on yelp, I'll even stop lusting after that Ducati Monster I really want.\"  This was the conversation I was having with the almighty about three hours after ingesting a carne asada burro from Armando's.   As far as my GI tract is concerned, Armando's is 9/11, Sandy Hook, the siege on the Branch Davidians in Waco and the lower Oakland Roller Derby finals all rolled into one horrid saga that has me seriously wondering if something isn't on fire in my bathroom.  No, that's just the hairs on my bum burning off.  For years after the 9/11 attacks Americans chanted \"never again\" like kool-aid sipping cultists. Armando's was my 9/11, and from here on I am saying \"NEVER AGAIN!!!\" to these sorts of poop inducing acts of terror perpetrated by evil and despicable men hell bent on getting me to purge the undigested red meat in my colon. If they never got it from John Wayne, I can never let Armando's take mine from me!  NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see Sonoran hot dog on the menu.  I was disappointed that it was drenched in everything and didn't taste good.  I usually get the California burrito and Adobada (similar or the same as Al Pastor) at every taqueria.  This location has flame broiled tasting carne asada and adobada, which I think is great compared to the usual grill fry.  There is fat on the meat, which some will not appreciate, but I truly prefer compared to the super lean of other taquerias.  The red and green condiment sauces actually has flavor and texture compared to the Armando's on Deer Valley.  The DV location is very very watered down.  There's one problem at this location that has been consistent since it opened.  The WAIT.  I've been here about 10 times since it opened at different days of the week and different times of the day.  Even as the only customer in the drive-thru, my usual order of 1 California burrito, 1 Adobada burrito,1  Cheese quesadilla, 1/2 order Super Nachos, 1 Chicken chimichanga always takes 25 minutes.  Last night I ordered the usual over the phone at 6pm and she asked how long will you be here, and I told her about 10 minutes since I only live over the hill in Tramonto.  She said OK.  I didn't get the food until 6:50pm.  Wow what a dinner rush.  It would've been nice if she said it will take 45 minutes.  It's great that I do not have to drive to the DV location anymore.  And I think Roberto's in Anthem is overrated and slightly overpriced since it was on Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives - except it was the 7th Ave location at the Shell gas station."}
{"text":"3 happy breakfast burrito customers. The Mando was a meat extravaganza, and my veggie version--potato, egg, and cheese--was huge and delicious.  Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"Armando's is the perfect place to go to for a late night meal...  It's fast and it's cheap, and at 2 in the morning it's great to chow down on some nachos, or rolled tacos and guacamole.. Yum!   My only suggestion would be to sweep out all those weird car gangs in the parking lot, who just hang out.... It just doesn't look safe, nor attractive..  I will be back, as its the only place around there with good food that's open late at night.."}
{"text":"I'll give two stars only because my son likes the tacos. Other than that this place is so disquietingly gross.  Dirty floor. Dirty tables. Dirty bathrooms. Dirty everything. Based on their location I would expect so much more: this place won't last because people don't like to eat in dirty restaurants."}
{"text":"Great little place for Mexican food. Always clean, the food is good to great depending on your choice. Prices are reasonable and if you want more salsa just ask with no upcharge.  Great service and I have never experienced a long wait either. Really glad they are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is great. They will make it to order. The veggie burro with fajita veggie is the best."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!! I ordered a Ranchero Breakfast burrito which is supposed to have steak, rice, beans, and eggs. I get home to eat and there is not any steak in the burrito."}
{"text":"This restaurant has big lit up sign that says drive thru open 24 HRS yet 3 days in A row at 5:30 AM You cant get any service there. All the lights are on and you can see A guy inside, but he wont respond to anything. One of the days he walked past the drive thru window and seen me there and told me they are closed. TURN YOUR FREAKIN SIGN OFF AND CHANGE YOUR ADVERTISING SO PEOPLE DONT WASTE THERE TIME THERE AND CAN GO SOME WHERE THATS OPEN AND WANTS BUSINESS. This is the store at 22nd AVE and Deer Valley RD in PHX"}
{"text":"Bean and cheese burrito was awful. The beans tasted like the canned beans you buy at the supermarket.  Overpriced food.  Try Filiberto's instead. Some of them have daily specials running monday thru friday."}
{"text":"Get the \"Armandos Breakfast Burrito\". This thing is really tasty. Its one of those burritos that is good at any time of the day. The other entrees are just ok. Its really the burritos that keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Filabertos has been closed for awhile now so I decided to try the nearby Armandos. To my surprise I was disappointed. I have been to this location twice and both times took forever. I used the drive thru and went inside the store. The second visit they lost my ticket and had to ask my order again. I had the carne asada quesadilla which was very dry and the chorizo breakfast burrito was just okay (the only reason this got 3 stars instead of 2). I will probably give it one more shot."}
{"text":"The Carne Asada Fries here definitely hit the spot when washed down with a little Horchata omnombom"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. It's the best of the fast Mexican joints by far"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to give Armando's Mexican food a one star. I ordered a pretty large order to bring home the family on Friday night. The wife wanted to try to be tacos. When I got home she open them up and asked me if I got them without meat. LOL what are you talking about she open them up and I'll be dug around you can see in the picture that the amount of meeting was very insignificant. Talk about cutting back on food costs. If you charge an extra $.50 per taco on top of your price that's already normal and comparable to all the other establishments of this type then do so. So as my wife Finished  she got up and told me he was hungry! Lol I called and asked the gal at Armando's if they had forgotten to put the meat in because it was very minimal. She had told me that that is the normal anatomy they always put. So I said OK have a nice day. She was very kind. However I am very disappointed. All of the burritos that we ordered we're pretty small except for the bean burrito. That's probably because it cost the least amount to make. So again I am pretty disappointed and Armando's at seven Street and Carefree highway. I would rather call Plaza Bonita to for El enchanting dos and do carry out next time!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was absolutely terrible. Our food was a complete mess when we arrived home to eat it. The sauce for the enchiladas was pouring into the bag and as a result the enchiladas had little to no sauce, meanwhile the bad held more sauce than the enchiladas. The food was very average to mediocre and a complete mess."}
{"text":"Not bad for Mexican fast food. The burrito with \"everything\" in it (and the kitchen sink) are decent. My only gripe was the long wait when we went through the drive-through. We only had one car in front of us and waited forever for our turn, then when we ordered (3 burritos), we were asked to pull over to a parking space and waited forever again!"}
{"text":"I love there food. Cure for any hangover and grat for late night beer munchies. But today the service was horrible! We waited 25 - 30 mins for 2 burritos! Everyone seemed to get there food before us. The burritos were really good tho."}
{"text":"Bland tasteless chimichanga. Pass on this one. Prices are ok but you get what you pay for. I can't think of any thing else to say about this place but Yelp wants longer reviews so here we are."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving this five stars is the rating should be commensurate with the type of restaurant.  This is a fast food restaurant basically, although they do have booths inside, it is a counter pick up.    The Green sauce is really good, tortillas homemade. I was super surprised at 'customer service is terrible here' because I live off of Central and Carefree Highway and pull through here all the time at different hours.  We come on Taco Tuesdays ($1 tacos), and so I'd rate those a 4, but my kids love them, they're a little sparse.  The green chili beef burrito is excellent, and they are constantly busy but extremely fast, so again surprised to hear otherwise.  I've been to all the Mexican foods in the area, and this is actually one of the best even fast food considered.    Their breakfast burritos with bacon, egg, cheese and potato I also highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Normally I love this place and get food here on a regular basis but I stopped off on my way home from a late night and wanted some food. It was only 11:45pm on a Wednesday night, went to the drive thru, waited like 4 minutes, no response. Drove around to the window, no response. Went and knocked on the door, the two guys in the kitchen ignored us. Don't claim to be 24 hours if you aren't going to actually serve customers 24 hours. Ended up ordering a pizza. My money will be spent elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"I feel like the quality has gone down. At least on the carne asada. It's tasted bland. My shrimp tacos were tasty though."}
{"text":"Ok so went to Armando's for the first time recently and got a delicious ham, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito and coffee for $4! My friends got grilled chicken and veggie burritos also very cheap and also pretty tasty for the price. However there were a few negatives about Armando's that definetly stuck out. First, when I went into the bathroom there were two cockroaches crawling around (big deal breaker). Second the food is clearly not the most healthy or made with the freshest ingredients (however that wasn't exactly expected). The service was ok in that; it was fast and we got whatever sides and salsa we wanted at no extra charge. Overall if there weren't any roaches and it would have been cleaner and better maintained would have given Armando's four stars for it's convenience."}
{"text":"When I stayed in North Phoenix for two weeks of training class this was the only authentic Mexican food I could find in the area. I was surprised that in Phoenix there would not be more Mexican food choices (I meant good ones) but I went back here several times for lunch. The food is a great value. The atmosphere is one of fast food as you order at the counter and pick it up when your number is called. But really good, anything I tried. And the tons of Mexicans that eat there all the time will back me up I'm sure."}
{"text":"The worst place ever. I ordered 3 rolled tacos when I took a bite out of 1 of them I realized they were cold. I brought them back in and they reheated all 3 of them including the one I took a bite out of. That was the first and last time I'll go there. If the manager reads this it's the guy with the red and black cap on."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall... Love their Armando's breakfast burrito. Large portions for the price. I hope they don't get too popular."}
{"text":"Armando's you are now a big suckfest. I used to love you...no more. About a year and a half ago I used to come here frequently with a coworker. The food was always unhealthy as hell, but delicious.   I moved jobs, so I hadn't been here in a while. I decided to go back for lunch today, and relive some of that old deliciousness. Didn't happen.  I know this place is a dive, so I didn't expect the moon, but my service and food sucked!  I walked up to the counter to order, no one else was waiting which was great. I stood there for over 5 minutes, and neither of the two women working even spoke to me. One looked at me and went back to the drive through window. She gave one car their food, then another one pulled up and she gave them their food. Then brand new car pulled up, and she gets on the intercom to take their order. I was there before that 3rd motherf*!@ing car! The other girl only comes up to the counter, after a guy eating at his table comes up to a counter for a refill, which she gets him, and still doesn't help me. By the way, his friend came up later to get a refill, and they tried to charge him for it. When he told them his friend did have to pay for his refill, they just told him he did have to pay. They were both drinking soda...how shitty and lame.  I honestly could have overlooked all this bullshit if the food was like it used to be. It wasn't. I ordered a chicken, bean, and cheese burrito and an iced tea. The burrito had no cheese, almost no beans, and huge chunks of super dry, flavorless chicken. The only good thing about it was the tortilla. I threw out most of the chicken, and mainly ate the tortilla. I basically paid $5 for a tortilla.   If I wanted gross food, I would have done the cooking! The reason I eat out is because I want food that is better than what I could make. I will never be back to Armando's, not even if they beg me, which I'm pretty sure they won't. Besa mi culo Armando's!"}
{"text":"Went to this place and was definitely surprised with my experience, my California burrito was hot and tasted great and the fish tacos were very good."}
{"text":"It sounded like Bastard Noise or Merzbow was blasting through the speakers of the drive thru menu.  Same menu as you'd find at any other 24 hour Mexican joint.  I only look at the burro section.  No 'Can i help you?' or 'Can I take your order?'.  Nothing like that.  I just go for it.  \"I'll have two breakfast burros; egg, potato and cheese.  And a bean and cheese burrito.\"  Noise distorts out through the speaker.  I get the hint that it's rhythmically broken up into syllables.    \"Hello?\".  More noise.  Fuck it.  I pull forward.  The lady comes to the drive-thru window and repeats my order back to me.  She's basically got everything right.  The tip jar is a styrofoam cup taped rather shoddily to the drive-thru window.  She's not really sexy or young or anything but she's pretty.  I put a quarter in the tip jar cup thingy.  Our burros were $10.11.  It takes about three to four minutes for the burros to be wrapped, bagged and given to us.  My kids are pretty stoked.  The red salsa is pretty great as well.    Then it's on to Greyhound Park as we cruise Van Buren and sight see on our way to the flea market.  Saturday is beautiful.  Note:  If you're at the drive thru window, don't look down.  It's full of old gum, straw wrappers, cigarette butts, gross spilled milk.  Trust me.  Eyes forward.  You're good."}
{"text":"Great taco Tuesday!!! Love the burritos and my kids love the carne asada fries!!! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"After living by this restaurant for a over a year I decided to give it a try tonight.  It has been raved as a great to place to eat by a local entertainer and I figured I would give it a shot.  Service was slow through the drive thru.  I ordered a chicken quesadilla and the girl forgot what I ordered by the time I got to the window.   As for the quesadilla the chicken was a little dry and not nearly enough cheese.   I would prefer next time they cut the quesadilla.  I got it home and it was just folded in a Styrofoam box.   Del Taco and Taco Bell at least cut theirs."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today, craving a green chile burrito. No cars in front of me or behind me in drive-thru, but I had a semi-long wait. I was ok with that since most restaurants of the like make it fresh and it's worth it. Burrito was a great size for the price, the green chile sauce was okay. But the meat was dry and stringy and not saturated/infused with green chile as if it had been marinating all day, like it should. Maybe this is just not their winner and I'll try something different another time probably, especially since it's so close to my work."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Better than the other huge franchise in the valley. The cashier is so sweet and the food is always great. I hesitated going for awhile, because from the street it's not that impressive and if you're from here you know that getting good food here is a crap shoot. But I was running late one day so gave it a shot. The carne asada burrito is so good and the rolled taco supreme is just beyond words. Tricky to eat, but amazing. Wasn't crazy about their milk cake though, it was soggy, like it had been frozen and defrosted"}
{"text":"Hey! This is pretty good stuff. Fast and tastes less greasy than the other \"Ricos\". I love the grande nachos!!! A lot!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best chimichanga's I have had ever... plus the food was fast and cheap!!  Very happy with my lunch"}
{"text":"Okay I just stopped through and the carne asada burrito was $6.60. The most expensive carne asada in the valley or drive around town all day and I eat carne asada burritos with all my deliveries and inspections. Wasn't that great but for $6.60 he should get chips and salsa and a drink probably. Oh and it was stuck in my teeth and very hard to chew I would rank this a 5 out of 10"}
{"text":"We love Armando's on DV so when we moved up here we were excited. Food is decent, however, customer service and wait is horrible. I asked for a soft taco and the cashier told me \"no\" and had to ask the cook what I was talking about... really? I had to explain I just wanted a soft tortilla and to not throw it in the deep fryer... She got very frustrated with me. It's a Mexican place, a soft taco shouldn't be a brain buster! :("}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite here while before heading to the Waterpark.  It was very clean inside, and the man behind the counter was great. Interesting mix of people seeming to be on break for lunch from surround business area.  V casual and easy spot to grab and bounce.  The burrito was MAAAAD soggy at the end, and ended up looking like catfood even though it was so so so delicious while consuming it. C'est la vie. Hot box it and before you go here it's even better."}
{"text":"This is a great fast food Mexican place. I would say it is similar to Filiberto's. They have a drive thru which is always super convenient. I ordered the #1, cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, rice, and beans. The beans are delicious, taco has good flavor, and I love the cheese enchilada (sauce is yummy). The rice is just \"ok\" for me. Red hot sauce is awesome. I put it on the rice to add some flavor. Overall it was good.   ***Update*** Sadly I am beginning to not feel very well. Major stomach ache now."}
{"text":"I eat here every once in a while, the breakfast burritos are amazing and always hit the spot. The customer service is lacking in some area but the food is good, the portions are large and the price is low. Great for a quick pitstop before work."}
{"text":"Breakfast at Armando's is awesome.  I always get the steak, egg and cheese burrito. Recently had lunch for the first time and had the Chicken Enchilada plate with red sauce and it was awesome.  The girls that work there are always nice and friendly.  I just wish they had a beer license."}
{"text":"Basic, generic Mexican kind-of-fast food restaurant, but like many of its brethren in that genre of eatery, it serves decent-quality stick-to-the-ribs fare. I do like the fact that they have a drive-in that's open way late at night, so that I can still get a tasty and substantial  dinner after a very late night at work."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and I must say the food is really good. They haven't messed up my order once and it always years fresh and hot! The drive thru can be a bit of a wait, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Best place ever! Only place I'll go to in Arizona for Mexican food! Tried other places and nothing compares to this place. Awesome employees as well! :)"}
{"text":"Great place, food is always good. The carne Asada fries are awesome and prices are way lower than filiberto's"}
{"text":"Out of all the little Mexican joints in the valley, this one takes the cake. Their food is so damn good it's atrocious. It is cheap,  they take their time, and they have a full service condiment bar with the best Green Sauce EVER. Sober or not, their food is most excellent!"}
{"text":"Update: Years since original review in 2011. Still eat here. Ratio of burned to not-burned food has decreased, but not enough to merit the 5th star.  I eat here often.  Good food at a decent price. Hit or miss though on the quality. I hate it when they burn the taco shell or tortillas and I don't find out until I get home. It doesn't happen all the time, but enough to make me comment. Glad I didn't leave a review the day that happened. I'd give them 5 stars if it never happened again."}
{"text":"This place totally not a satisfying place. I mean... I've tried it more than once and yet they still keep messing up. Specially the lady at the counter, she is very rude and seems she doesn't enjoy her job. I mean; if this isn't the right job for you, perhaps you should move on and let others be a better employee. The place looks quite clean but the smell just doesn't feel right. You are more than free to try this place out but I warn you.. hold your breath while you are there."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick fix to a taco craving my friend & I had.. We venture a few miles away from my loft to go get our fix fixed..  Umm ...  I don't think so... Chips & salsa? More like a styro to-go box filled w unsalted chips & pico de gallo over the chips?! Who does that?! Taco.. 2stars.... I always get a chicken taco, if I can get the meat in shredded form.. I'm weird about my meat! But this is more like ground chicken..& they placed it in the styro to go box next to the cheese enchilada I ordered to go with..so the taco became a part of the smothered enchilada mess.... Yep... Drowned in lukewarm red enchilada sauce... That enchilada... I couldn't finish... The cheese was not melted inside.  Ok.. Should I have complained..(as a very advising yelper once scolded me for).. Probably! But in truth.. The girl behind the counter had rubbed me wrong already... By telling me I looked 'tire'... & secondly by having a host issue with her credit card machine... Asking me to pay cash... Whatever.  I'm harsh? Possibly... 2stars... & that's a compliment."}
{"text":"Easy off and back on the freeway when you need to get your midnight burrito fix on this place fits the bill and does not cost you an arm and a leg"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Would not return. Hot sauce is flavorless and not even slightly hot. Tacos were very small. Dead bugs right behind my seat (on the window sill) chips cost $2-something extra..restaurant was clean though."}
{"text":"We love this place! The rellenos are great, the pollo asado is great, the fish tacos are wonderful ... it's clean and organized, and the best part? DRIVE THRU!!!  My husband is crazy about the Sonoran Dog. I think he'd eat it every day if he could. The salsa's homemade too. The only thing we didn't care for was the choco flan. Perhaps we should've eaten it at room temp, but it didn't taste at all like flan."}
{"text":"Being in the mood for a breakfast burrito I searched on Yelp for some reviews and found this place. It had a couple mixed reviews but I have to agree with the majority that this place seems pretty good. I can't give an extensive review since I've only had the breakfast burrito so far but I give it a big YUM review.   It's a good size burrito and I do like the tortilla they used too. The salsa is hot enough to add that kick but not over the top...it leaves that nice hot tingle on your lips after eating. My only suggestion is the eggs were a little too done so they sort of had a burnt flavor, however, perhaps that flavor gave it a little extra something... in any case, I'm sure I'll be trying this place again soon."}
{"text":"Ate here this morning, bf and I both got bacon and egg burritos. As I am eating mine I notice an awful taste, but my bf didnt so I thought I was crazy. I ate maybe half before I wanted to gag. So my bf tried mine and noticed that awful taste too. It tasted like it was rotten, and like a dirty dish rag and vomit.  Like their fridge broke and the food rotted in there all night. Only thing different about our burritos is that I used red sauce and he used green sauce. 6 hours later, I start vomiting and have been since. This is the only thing I have eaten today.  I am not thrilled.  I am never eating here again. Lesson learned. They need to be inspected before they make others sick as well. If I could give less than 1 star,  I'd give them zero."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a while so thought I'd try them again, this time for breakfast at 8:30AM on a Saturday.  Ordered the Mexican breakfast and it was listed as coming with rice & beans on the drive through sign but I never received them.  Have you ever been burned at a drive through, only to find out the dissappointment when you open the bag and are too far down the road to turn around?  Well, this was one of those times of getting burned - in more than one sense.  I received a breakfast burrito that was scorched.   I mean this in the most literal sense, the exterior of the burrito was speckled with black marks the size of a dime.  It was so badly burned that I could smell it even before I opened the wrapping. The smell permeated my car. This is the scent that only occurs when oil has been heated too hot, well above scorching levels.  But the burning affect doesn't stop at the exterior of the tortilla.  Oh no. Inside the eggs had been cooked the same way - scorched from too much heat.   It's obvious Armandos is cooking with their oil way too hot and the food ends up smelly with black specs inside and out.    Funny, the green peppers inside were raw.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HEALTH INSPECTION RECORD  Inspected Date Major Violations  Score Purpose Award  1/10/2011                 4                       49        ROUTINE INSPECTION  NO AWARD"}
{"text":"My final review of this place. I figured I'd give it one more shot.   cold bland taco's, cold boring beef enchiladas. watery bland \"red sauce\". Watery tomatillo salsa.  I'm done. never again."}
{"text":"I have an emotional connection to this restaurant so I may be a little biased. This is the Mexican fast food that my parents would take me to when I was younger...whatever but I LOVE ARMANDO'S. Armando is always reliable on a late night or really, any time at all. I haven't had a majority of the menu, but for basics like the bean and cheese, chips with cheese and guac, rolled tacos with cheese and guac are delicious when you're craving such things. I also absolutely love their veggie burrito (without lettuce) and the Armando's breakfast burrito. Sometimes it can be hit or miss, usually involving too much unmelted cheese, but I can't help but love it. I will always root for Armando's over any other late night Mexican. Even when I lived in Tempe I would drive out to Armando's. My friends agree that it is the best amongst the Mexican fast food. I've never had a problem with service, even over the 4324328940 times i've been there. They always give plenty of napkins and sauces which is always necessary when eating Armando's. Go there! Don't let the Fili B's in the same complex defeat Armando's!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Armando's is amazing! I stop in before work to get their breakfast burritos and they are the best around."}
{"text":"If you're craving mexican and its late at nite, this is def the place to go! Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Not very good. I have steak burrito and it tastes like it was a can of corn beef hash. The texture was the same too. Also the place was very loud for 10 am. Tv was on loud with a drama show. And the blender was going. And the other tv was loud with sports"}
{"text":"Love this place! The Deer Valley location is 2 minutes from my job and it's a good go to for breakfast. I always order the egg and bacon burrito and I'm always super satisfied. I don't even know how many eggs or how much bacon they put in it. All I know is it's fabulously delicious.   The restaurant itself is a hole in the wall, not a place you would go for a sit down dinner or on a date. The drive through is convenient and it's obvious the food is made fresh to order because you'll sit there and wait for your good forever. But it's worth it! Freshly made food combined with 24/7 hours and super cheap prices makes this a good alternative to your 'traditional' fast food breakfast. I can get much more food here for the same (or less) than what I would pay at McDonald's across the street for a satisfying meal.  The employees are all very friendly, which is awesome."}
{"text":"Went here for first time for taco Tuesday night. Bought  several beef and several chicken. Some were good others had very little meat in them very inconsistent . Will try again hope the quality control gets better"}
{"text":"Armandos...our new go-to Mexican joint!!  The Muchacaka burrito and the Huevos Ranchero burrito were simply delicious!  The manager checked with me prior to leaving on a take away order to make sure everything was in order......excellent excellent customer service.  I have read some of the negative reviews on Armando's and I am left scratching my head especially by the 1 star review on 4/1/2011......A very mindless and naive review....if your going to rip someones business then take the time to tell them what needs to be worked on.  The hot sauce is very tasty, very spicy and is fairly vinegary which was a refreshing change.  The flour tortillas are the kind that are a bit translucent from all that great lard used in the making of......"}
{"text":"In previous Yelps, I have mourned that the closest Filiberto's for my chile relleno fix is a goodly 30-40 minute drive from Cave Creek.   I mourn no more.  We discovered Armando's when it was featured in Carefree-Cave Creek Chamber of Commerce newsletter---DH found it and asked if I knew there was a little Mexican place along Carefree Highway?  And, you know, it kind of sounded \"Filiberto-ish\"? Nope, did not.  So we had driven up to Cottonwood on an errand and it just so happened we hit 7th and CH right at dinner time and we just wanted some take-home so we could go home and put up our feet and eat and drink wine.    We went inside.  Brightly lit---typical \"---berto's\" decor (you know, Filiberto's, Roberto's, Edberto's, Sueberto's...) with about a half dozen people at the tables.  And, just like every \"Berto's\" I have been in---spotlessly clean!  I LOVE that!!!!  Just about the same menu too!  So, what do you think I ordered?  Yeppers---#11...chile rellenos-no-rice-extra beans-green chile sauce.  (Sometimes I am sooo boring!)  DH got the carne asada burrito-no rice-extra beans-red sauce.  We took them home, and because it's SO CLOSE to our house, our meals were still really warm when we sat down.  What can I say---delish.  Freshly prepared, nicely fried (no old grease flavor!), filled with gooey cheese and a generous portion.  I was in heaven.  The green chile sauce really had flavor---it was actually not on par with Filiberto's---it was better!  DH really liked his carne asada burrito---he said it was great flavor, tasted very fresh.  The beans were good.  So, this is now our go-to Mexican carry-out---I'll probably be in there at least once a week.  If DH and I have any caveats, it was that we wish we could get different beans.  It would be nice if they offered Borracho beans (I'll give them my recipe!) or black or pinto beans----refried beans are just kind of---refried beans.  But very tasty, nonetheless---have you ever had the ones that have that weird lardy-taste?  These do not!  And the lady who waited on us---Latina, forty-ish, dark hair pulled back in a knot---is very nice.  And someone complained about a wait---I didn't time it, but I can pretty much guarantee we did not wait over 7 minutes for our meals, which I think is acceptable for something that is made-to-order.  You want Mexican in three minutes, go to Taco Hell,  where everything is pre-prepared  and has been sitting on the steam table for six hours.  Philistines!  So I am a happy camper.  And I can quit sending Filiberto's headquarters emails asking for a store up further north!"}
{"text":"This is a good Mexican-Food restaurant. The carne asada burrito was very good. The salsa and spice also tasted good. The decor wasn't super cool, but the food makes up for it. Affordable and tasty. Good job."}
{"text":"First time in, I tried chicken enchiladas.  Meh.  I tried again tonight.  There was a little left-over dark meat in there....but overall, it tasted like a Chinese egg roll with lots of hot peppers."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite for lunch with a co worker.  I had their daily special of two tostadas which comes with a side of beans and rice. The tostadas were huge! It was nice light meal that filled me up just right. I also tried their pineapple soda since their fountain wasn't working. It was interesting but too sweet for my taste.  Not bad for a fast food place."}
{"text":"Great!  fast breakfast lunch dinnerMexican food. Muy Saboso! I've grown-up in the southwest and know good Mexican food when I find it. This place used to be called Armando's but has recently changed hands, however the food is just downright tasty.The green sauce and red sauce are flavorful and just hot enough.anything with chicken is juicy and tender. The beans are cooked to perfection in. I haven't tried the breakfast Barito selections yet. They do have green chilies from New Mexico which is a real plus in Arizonaso give this place a shot when you're working late at night and you need to get a quick fix in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Stay away from Filiberto's unless it's the one on Dobson and Main.  Actually, that one might even suck now because of the dregs of society getting off and on buses and the light rail racket.    This place, in contrast, is great.  Great service, great portions.  All-around best quick Mexican food joint around.  I risk a bunch of idiots showing up at this place by writing favorably about it but so be it.  If you want your rolled tacos to actually have meat in them, get a dozen of them here."}
{"text":"I love this place.   The best Mexican food at a good price! We always get carne Asada dishes."}
{"text":"I can only speak on their b.fast burritos and their mini tacos. They are the most authentic in the area. If you're the type looking for an enchilada, there are better options not too far. The place is always clean, plates are well proportioned and price is right."}
{"text":"This place is better, the beans are made with oil and are just delicious. The rice was moist and flavorful, not to mention the awesome salsa bar they have going on inside. The specials are marked on a board by the counter as you come in. I remember when we used to sneak in burritos in the Harkins Theater just across the way. This is one of the better fast food Mexican restaurants to get you late night fix and they are open 24 hours..."}
{"text":"When I see a restaurant with a 4 star rating on Yelp, I expect the food to be good. The food at Alberto's was mediocre at best. To make matters worse, my wife found a hair on her plate. Eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"Armando's is SO good... way better than any of the other drive through options in the area.  They have out-of-this-world breakfast burritos (I usually get the Armando's Special; eggs, potatoes, bacon, cheese)...and they're HUGE.  I usually eat half in the morning and half later for a snack.   For lunch; don't pass up the carne asada tacos; delicious.   Everything is really well priced, too - pass up the chains and give Armando's a shot.  It's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Awful! I went through the drive-thru and ordered two chicken enchiladas w/rice & beans. I got home, opened the box and took a couple bites & got no chicken, so I cut the enchiladas open and it had 95% onions & peppers and 5% chicken! I love Mexican food, but this is the worst I've ever had! On a positive note, the rice & beans were good."}
{"text":"Coffee drinkers Looking for breakfast or brunch with coffee?  Don't come here.  They do not serve COFFEE!!!    Who has breakfast and doesn't served coffee  McDonald's, Jack in the box and Taco are around the corner."}
{"text":"Been her 2 times recently since my goto Burrito shop has been horrible. (FREDRICOS- ON CAVECREEK AND 101) Armandos has amazing food and good service, go check it out! Huge burritos for cheap!"}
{"text":"Their carne asada fries are amazing!!! The food and service were really good and the facility was quite clean. Great place for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of authentic Mexican fare so I thought I'd try this place on Taco Tuesday. Hands down the worst tacos I've ever had. The beef was tasteless - not bad tasting, just completely lacking in any seasoning or flavor, and as dry as a new mop head. The \"shells were fresh and hot - and greasy and chewy, not crispy. I had half of one taco and decided that $3 was a small loss for terrible terrible tacos, so I dumped the remaining 2-1/2 and headed off down the road. Maybe you'll have better luck with other dishes. Avoid the so-called tacos."}
{"text":"We have now eaten here twice and enjoyed it both times. The first time we did the drive thru. I ordered the fish taco combo and the hub's had the chimichanga. Both entrees were IOUs and came with some great refried beans. It also had rice which we were surprised was rather bland. The order also came with their red and green salsa. Today we are inside the restaurant. We found it very attractive and very clean. I ordered the port tamales, which were delish, and my husband has the carnitas, also very tasty. We both had the combos but I asked that omit the rice. Hub's had the rice and beans. There is a side bar, near the drinks dispenser, that has their salsas, pico de Gallo and some yummy marinated sliced carrots. Just the right amount of spice. We will definitely be coming back to try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"Clean facilities with great food and service. Love that I can call ahead and they will have it ready for us to pick up."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Armando's today. Food was hot, carne asada was not super juicy but was the way I like it so if your used to a greasy burrito this is not for you. Food was over all reasonable."}
{"text":"I come here once a week as I work swing shift and fast food is slim pickings at around 1130pm at night in this part of Phoenix. Also since I've been frequent here for the past 2 years I've gotten to know the front cashier lady who is very nice and also found out that the best cook they have online is the one that works the late night hours. Been here at all times of day and found out that everything from taste of food and service is much better late night. I would recommend their shrimp burrito, fish tacos, carne asada burrito and their al pastor(grilled marinated pork) nachos. It's not the healthiest of choice but for the quality and quantity they give it definitely outweighs the price. So if four looking for a late night craving of Mexican food with a great selection of aguas frescas(horchata, tamarindo, pina, etc.) look no further! Btw, they have a 24hr operation and drive thru. Given 3 stars cause of location, lack of cleanliness, and lack of consistency as mentioned earlier regarding am staff versus the stellar pm staff. I know sounds like I'm asking for the stars but I should keep it in perspective it is a whole in the wall diner with great tasting food."}
{"text":"Love this place! Carne Asada burros are fabulous. My wife likes the taco salad.  I read on another review that there was a language barrier. I couldn't disagree more they are always  very friendly and remember that my wife and I love the hot carrots so they always include more at no charge without us asking. We've never had a problem communicating and its always clean when we come in and dine."}
{"text":"We have only been through the drive thru so I have no idea what it is like inside... BUT their food is bomb. Such a great bean burro! They are also always very nice :)"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never reviewed or checked in here before. We go all the time and its boyfriends favorite burrito place.  I always get the adobada and he gets a variety of things including the rolled tacos which are always good. The breakfast burritos are great too.  The people are always super fast and nice and its cheap!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place late at night for years.  They never disappoint me.  They are friendly, fast, and the food is made to order.    I really enjoy their tasty carna asda tacos, their massive carna asda fries and their two huge beef burrito platter.  YUM!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved to New River and we've eaten at Armando's a half dozen times. The food is prepared quickly and everything we've tried so far has been delicious. Very large portions and reasonable prices make this place a winner."}
{"text":"This place has amazing burritos for a fair price  I will stop and get food here often. The workers here are straight from Mexico are limited in how they communicate. Honestly, i got a breakfast burrito last night  and found an old lug nut in it that mustve of fallen off of the grill acidently or something but it didnt change how amazing the burrito was. I really like this place, though my rating is soley based off of taste,portion size, and price."}
{"text":"We slept late this past Saturday and wanted burritos for breakfast.  I was feeling to lazy to go to the store for the essentials and then cook and clean up; so we decided to try Armando's on Carefree Highway.  I headed out the door w/ the orders and the $$.    Armando's is on the south side of Carefree Highway at 7th street, behind the Discount Tire; it's at the west end of the strip mall.  When I went inside, the place was neat, clean, and empty!?!?  I know it was a little later in the morning, but I was still surprised that I was the only one there.  The young lady at the counter greeted me w/ a smile and was pleasant and helpful w/ the order.   I ordered a chorizo and egg burrito, a \"Mando's\" burrito for my wife; and as usual, a bean and cheese burrito for Jr.  I also ordered a side of rice.  Before I knew it, I had my food and was heading for home.  The chorizo/egg burrito was good.  The tortilla was soft and it was stuffed w/ a nice mixture of the spicy sausage and egg.  My wife enjoyed the \"Mando's\" burrito; it had egg, potato, bacon, and cheese.  Once again, the tortilla was fresh and soft.  Jr. liked the bean and cheesed burrito, but it was a little to big for him.  I had a small sample of it, and must say the beans were good.  The side of rice was very good.  The rice had a lot of flavor, and was moist w/out being sticky.   I can't find my receipt, but I want to say the entire bill was about $13, and we were all full and happy w/ our breakfasts.    I am giving Armando's 3 stars, since the only meal I have had here was breakfast.  We will try it soon for lunch or dinner; and if it's just as good as breakfast, I'll up it to 4 stars.  I'm glad that Armando's is in the area; it is a welcome addition."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican! Especially the breakfast burritos (my favorite is the machaca)"}
{"text":"I do not want to bash this place because the food was OK, but as other reviewers have said you do not see the value here as opposed to other taco shops.  The place is pretty clean, that being said on my experience there was not a clean booth to be found, we retrived napkins, wetted them, and cleaned our own table.  The temperature inside the restaurant would have been too cold in the summer, I do not think they had the heat on, probably a function of keeping the bills down.  In addition to their keeping the bills down the portions are rather small, there is no salsa bar with fill your own salsas (Other Armando's have this), and the $2 upcharge on the rice and beans is barely worth it, only a taste of each.  Given the limited choices in the area I think this will be a burrito to go stop going forward."}
{"text":"Love their potato, egg, and cheese breakfast burritos! Filling and super huge."}
{"text":"I had the beef taco plate with a Mexican coke. Very good, will go back next time I am in the area"}
{"text":"Just moved here and this place came highly recommended by a friend. We ordered 2 Armando's breakfast burritos and a carne asada quesadilla. We get our order and notice there's only 1 little bag of carrots. We ask for another because we ordered for 3 people. The woman said it was an additional dollar per bag of carrots. Umm...WHAT?! So if you order 3 items (like we did) everyone is supposed to share a teeny tiny bag of pickled carrots?! I paid it because I didn't want to share my damn carrots, but damn!! Never again.  The food was nothing special. The breakfast burrito was like a home burrito and the quesadilla was 1 flour tortilla, a little bit of cheese and meat. No sour cream, no pico de gallo...nothing. This place isn't cheap either."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, have had breakfast burritos, tacos, combo plates, horchatas.  It's always great.  Well seasoned."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast burritos and chorizo platter. Also try the tacos, rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole. I wish the carnitas was actual shredded pork but it is more of a cut up pork chop. No complaints overall although I have had a french fry end up in my burrito once. Would also be nice if they packaged the food separately. If you get a combo that includes enchiladas they put the other item (taco, burrito, etc.) on top of the enchilada. Makes it a bit messy and would prefer the other item be wrapped separately.   Staff is friendly and the food comes out pretty quick."}
{"text":"Just an egg and cheese breakfast burrito, came with random grills scraps.  Just nasty.  Egg tasted like it was cooked with engine oil."}
{"text":"Love the Carne Asada Burritos!  We've tried a few other good items, but I always come back to the Carne Asada Burrito.  I do notice that there is some slight variation in the taste, depending on what time of day and who's cooking, but it's very minor.   Very good food!"}
{"text":"Their number 9 chimichanga meal is absolutely amazing. It's one of the only things I get. I have also has their nacho fries and those too are great. Good food overall and one of my favorite Mexican joints in the area.."}
{"text":"It's a fair meal when your nearby.  A little more authentic than the fast fast food mexican.   Service is a bit somber.  They keep it fairly clean (someone has been mopping the floor both visits).  My cheese enchilada on my first visit was not melted (that may be how they make them here?).  Chicken enchiladas were decent."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite fast Mexican food. It seems like they have stopped deep frying their own shells and are using premade crunchy shells. Whatever the case my lunch was unusually bland today...and the \"crunchy\" taco shells were gross."}
{"text":"A no frills Mexican  taqueria with delicious food. I like the fact that they serve breakfast all day.The staff is super friendly and their prices are very reasonable.  I've tried a multitude of their dishes on separate visits, from the breakfast plates and burritos. They also have a  salsa and pico de gallo bar. The menu is very large and has everything you could possibly dream of in terms of Mexican food without making a hole in your wallet.  This morning, I had their egg, bacon and cheese burrito and it was scrumptious.!   Their bathrooms are super clean,which is a plus in my book and last but not least, there is always Mexican music playing which gives the restaurant a nice ambiance and little feeling of being in Mexico!  Supposedly, this location is open 24 hours and also has a drive thru. Highly recommended if you are looking for a quality meal without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"UhMediocre Mexican food it taste ok i use to get  California burrito on my lunch break  but i stopped cause depending on who's was working they would charge me different"}
{"text":"Salsa was bland. Taco shell was almost inedibly hard and the shell under my tostada tasted like deep fried plastic. Couldn't take more than one bite. Would not visit again. Also, no ac and it's hot!!"}
{"text":"This is just like Filiberto's. Fast-food mexican food. It's really good and taste pretty authentic to me. My hubby and I stopped in for a quick bite to eat and we went there because he heard it was good from his co-workers. I'm a huge critic of mexican rice and beans and this place has it down. I got the lunch special of the day which was 2 bean tostadas with beans and rice. It was sooo much food and I was so stuffed!  Next time I will get something smaller. You can't beat all that food for $5! They have a good salsa bar with all the fixings!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The rice and beans are really good. Breakfast is so good. Love the tacos and tostada. It is nice that they are just down the street."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food on the go. I get my lunches from here every now and again.  Very satisfactory food, but the drive-through speaker is kinda scary."}
{"text":"So........I'm pretty much \"anti burrito\" in the state of AZ, because I haven't found anything that can compare to the burritos you can get in San Diego.  I've had a few here in AZ, and they just don't compare.  The other day though, I was craving a burrito.  7:45 AM, a breakfast burrito it is.......  I went through the drive through here at Armando's and got myself a steak, egg and cheese burrito, and added potatoes.  My total was $7.03 (little bit high for a breakfast burrito, but it was worth it), paid the nice drive through lady my money, and took my burrito to work.  Here is how it was................  Breakfast Burrito-  I unwrapped this thing and saw a beautiful charred tortilla that looked delicious!  I took a bite into this thing and knew right away that I had found a winner!  The layering of this thing was perfect!  Every square inch of this burrito had bites of potato, egg and steak.  It may have been the best layered breakfast burrito I have ever seen.  A lot of times, you get the egg folded in and strips of steak and huge chunks of potatoes.  Not in this one!  This had perfectly scrambled and mixed up fluffy eggs, little tiny pieces of steak, soft potatoes and bites of that heavenly tortilla all the way down.  The only complaint I have is the skimpness of the cheese.  Seemed like it was melted onto the tortilla while it was griddled, but it was really skimp.  Could hardly taste any of it.  The other ingredients made it up for it though.  They also have killer salsas here!  The red one was just spicy enough, and the real star of the show was the green tomatillo based salsa verde.  It was DELICIOUS!  Some of the best green salsa I have ever had.  Great taste, little flecks of cilantro and onions in it.  Damn fine salsa!    Overall, it was a very, very good breakfast burrito.  A little bit high on price ($7.03), but it was a good sized burrito and the flavors were great!  I'll be back once a breakfast burrito craving hits!"}
{"text":"An excellent knock-off of the ___berto's taquerias. Or is it the other way around? In any case, this location is the best of the bunch, including any Filiberto's (though for the best Filiberto's-proper, go to the location at 19th Ave & Thunderbird).  The adobada and carne asada are particularly good here. And I once witnessed an altercation in the parking lot that concluded after one of the participants fired his pistol into the air.  The carne asada burrito was particular great that night."}
{"text":"Not bad for a 24 hour mexican place.  Their refried beans were delicious. The street tacos (carne asada) were okay.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  Ill probably come back here simply because it's very close and open 24 hours.  The drive thru took a long time but hopefully that was a fluke."}
{"text":"First time coming here. I have been on a fish taco kick lately and noticed they served them so decided to try them out. I read some bad reviews so was skeptical but came anyway and I'm glad I did. I went through the drive-thru, service was quick, the woman who took my order and handed me my food was very pleasant and nice, the rice and beans portions were perfect. The tacos tasted fantastic. The only thing I'd change would be the size of the fish, it was on the small side or maybe add in a third taco, but other than that this place is great. Armando's will become a regular lunch stop for me!"}
{"text":"Customer service is terrible here and the drive thru???? Forget it! It takes an eon to get through!! If you do make it to the window without leaving because it takes so long, they don't even acknowledge you once you're there, but they'll stare at you while your parked there waiting. It would be a bit more polite to at least acknowledge your customers while they are waiting.   The food lacks the flavor. Get lots of salsa to spice it up. Skip taco Tuesday's, they are not worth it. If you're looking for Mexican flavor, head elsewhere.   The price here is right where it should be. Cheap food and if you've got the time and just hungry, then it'll pass, but I can't say you'll put up with it too often for what it lacks in taste."}
{"text":"where do I start?  Here goes.  Rolled tacos--hard, half rolled, SALTY-did I mention hard, like break your teeth hard? chicken burrito-go up the street to  El Cerrito-they make it right. This was a gluey, wet, super-duper salty mess with a sour flavor. The bean burrito? weak, floppy, and kinda bland. AND they charge 65 cents for cheese, then barely give you any.  This place is TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"This used to be my local haunt for a decent and fast carne asada burrito for an insanely good price. Well, I went in a couple days ago and everything was all good until I saw the cook microwave the tortilla for my burrito! I'm sorry but anyone with a stitch of cooking knowledge knows that if you microwave a tortilla to heat it up it becomes almost instantly stale. How much effort does it take to throw it on the plancha and heat it up for 10 seconds?!?! That made me so mad. The carne asada has gone downhill a bit from where it used to be and is on the dry side, but still had OKAY flavor. The pico was nearly all onion which doesn't bother me since I love onions. With all this being said, This place used to be decent for being your typical phoenix mexican fast food joint but I think those days may have vanished. Unfortunate, I really hope they pick up their game again."}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast burritos in town. The tortillas they use have a good authentic Mexican taste unlike any other Mexican place I've been . I always enjoy the hash brown burrito."}
{"text":"This spot is great for late night food or Mexican food in the neighborhood or something not chipotle. I like the nachos or street tacos. They've recently started charging to use debit or credit for your purchase. That's a buzzkill"}
