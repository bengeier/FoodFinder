{"text":"I really can't say enough good things about the food here! Try the duck confit - tender meat with a thin crispy coating. Absolutely delicious.

All they need to do is redesign the layout of the restaurant and it would be a perfect 5 star!!!"}
{"text":"Bought the travelzoo coupon for $49. The food was okay. My final bill with two glass of wine came out to be an extra $45. By the end of the night my dinner cost $94!!! Not worth it for a cafe like atmosphere. If you want to take a date and is going to spend $94go to the Keg instead because the food is better and the atmosphere is better. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"I've gone now a couple of times to Absolute, and I've enjoyed my time there. The food is good for the price. I ordered the roasted chicken sandwich, available on their brunch menu, and it was delicious. The staff is nice and deferential. The place is a bit dark, and it could be a bit lighter, but I'm not that big on aesthetics. Basically, we're going here again."}
{"text":"Came here because we had a promo deal. The outside and interior are nothing special but the food is AMAZING. Major compliments to the chef. I'd highly recommend if you're ever in the Yonge/St.Clair area and looking for a great meal."}
{"text":"I've spent a lot of time in the Yonge/St. Clair neighbourhood but never noticed this restaurant until last week, as it is tucked into one of the buildings on the south side.  Boy, am I glad I discovered it!

The food was excellent and service was very attentive.  We ordered the braised lamb shank special and atlantic salmon as our entrees and both were prepared perfectly.  We also enjoyed the wild shrimp and crab cake appetizer.

On the way out, we noticed Absolute also offers brunch so we'd like to try that in the near future as well!"}
{"text":"Was in the area with my mother and we stopped in for lunch because the menu looked good.  We got the Steak Frites and the Croque Monsieur - both were FANTASTIC.  The Steak was cooked perfectly and the fries were delicious.  Came with a delicious gravy, great veggies and aoili with a bit of a bite for the fries. My mother loved the Croque Monsieur - fantastic sandwich (brie, yummy ham, beautiful brioche) and the generous salad that came with it was also great. 

The prices were VERY reasonable for the quality  of the food you get and the waitress was lovely and attentive.  I would definitely return again and highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant after a long day of apartment moving. We were hungry and had their dinner specials. The portions were a good size and service was friendly and prompt. We also had dessert which was satisfying. Good value for money. Would return here again!"}
{"text":"I come from a family of pretty picky particular eaters.  Mom and I share an affinity towards French cuisine (I love my foie and she loves a good baguette); dad almost never has to look at the menu (his default is always steak); and my sister is a little all over the map.

Being dad's birthday, I tried to find a place that balanced everyone's needs and that is how I stumbled upon Absolute Restaurant & Cafe, which describes itself as a modern French bistro.  It is located on the ground floor of an office building.  The décor is that of your traditional French bistro with a dessert counter displaying the offerings du jour.

On this particular Saturday night, they had one server who also doubled as the bar man.  Pretty slim staffing for one of the busier nights for dinner service.  I applaud him for his ability to multi-task as he single-handedly runs the restaurant for the night, save for the kitchen staff and General Manager.

Their wine list is sufficient with a special section for \"Premium Reds\" which include a Cabernet Sauvignon from Sonoma Valley.  We order a Chilean Malbec from the regular list to compare notes and all agreed that it was better.  But then again, we may have been comparing apples to oranges.  The Cab Sauv was just too tannic for our palates.

Highlights of the evening included Steamed P.E.I. Mussels in a tomato and white wine sauce which had us sopping up the juice with slices of baguette from the bread basket; Veal Liver which was juicy and tender and the Seared Scallops on a bed of red beet risotto.

Desserts were lacklustre and most likely not made in house as they are displayed cafeteria style in a refrigerated case.  Perhaps the most foul of the lot was the Lemon Meringue Pie which was so artificial it may have been made with a pudding mix and a can of whipped cream; the Tiramisu Trifle is more like a Jell-O with its overuse of gelatin.  The Triple Chocolate Cake did its job - you can't go wrong with chocolate.  The best dessert was the Blueberry Cheesecake which got a thumbs up from everyone with its fresh, dairy flavour and fruity topping.  Do order their Cappuccino if you decide to have dessert.

We had purchased a Groupon for 4 for $69 (2 appetizers, 4 mains, 4 desserts) which is still available here.  There's also a Buytopia deal for a 3-course prix fixe dinner including a glass of wine or beer.  That deal can be viewed here.

All in all, a satisfactory dinner.  I couldn't say with ABSOLUTE-tion that I would return for a meal unless I were in the area; but I wouldn't abhor the idea either.  Nothing really wowed us but the quiet car ride home meant that nothing was terribly bad either.  Yes, we, as a family tend to rant if we've had a particularly bad dinner experience."}
{"text":"For the price-point, quality and service, this is as good as it gets for a neighbourhood restaurant! 
We were there for dinner after searching for a spot close to where we'd be attending a concert - a couple of miles from so many restaurants in Yorkville. The food was delicious, wine list more than adequate. The menu was varied and the presentation was lovely. We had starter salads which were fresh and plentiful and offered delicious and different tastes. One of us had chicken, the other salmon, and both found them cooked to perfection. The dessert menu had several tasty offerings and we loved our pecan tart and chocolate truffle cake. The meal was a super value.... and the tipping point to the fifth star was the superb and knowledgeable service offered to us by our server, and the friendliness of the chef as we left. We will be back, and are recommending it to all our friends."}
{"text":"We went to Absolute on a Travelzoo vouture..... and really we got the feeling we were eating \"voucher\" rather than paying full fare for the dinner. We arrived and were promptly given glasses of Prosecco as per the deal. If we poured both together they would not have equalled one glass. We were choosing what we were going to order and (the restaurant was maybe 20% filled) a woman walked over and tried to set plated down at our table. We said the food was not ours.. she attempted to place them with an other couple before finally finding the right customers. We ordered the shrimp/crab cakes and they were good. However, serving them on a salad plate with salad forks took something away from the dish., I had the lamb shank and my partner had chicken. The chicken was adequate .. t he lamb totally overcooked and the saffron risotto tasteless. Deserts came with our dinner and the slice of berry tart was as small as the glass of prosecco. When the bill came there was a 15% gratuity added. That really was inappropriate. My suggestion.... stay home and order in."}
{"text":"I came to know about this restaurant through a Travelzoo deal.  The food was amazing, the service not so much.  

Included in the deal, we ordered a crab and shrimp cake as appetizer, a seared wild scallop and a duck confit as entrees, and 2 desserts.  The crab and shrimp cakes were full of flavour and cooked just right.  I could tell they were freshly made in house.  The scallops entree was the better of the 2 entrees.  The scallops were very fresh, delicious and seared to perfection, and the risotto tasted delicate.  I loved this dish.  The duck confit was tender and flavourful.  The sweet potato pudding contrasted the rich flavour of the duck.  My only issue was that the meat was a little over-cooked.  We ordered a creme brulé and a white/dark chocolate cake as desserts.  I am a sucker of traditional, rich, unhealthy creme brulé.  The Absolute version was more contemporary and had more egg white in proportion, so I didn't like it as much.  However, if you prefer a lighter creme brulé, you will like this one.  The chocolate cake was rich but nothing special.

There were 2 servers for a Friday evening.  We advised the female greeter that we had a reservation, but she ignored it and led us to a table directly across the kitchen entrance.  This was not the type of seating I expected when I had an advanced reservation.  As there were many vacant tables, there was no reason to seat us there at all.  We requested a change of table, and it was immediately accommodated.  Then came the wait to order.  We spent a good 10 minutes to decide what to order, and we waited another 10 minutes for a male waiter to come around to take our orders.  I quickly realized that there was only 1 waiter for the evening, so the service was slow.

All in all, I love the food at Absolute.  The chef cares about what comes out from the kitchen.  The food is delicious, fresh and well presented.  Though we used a coupon deal, I noted that the regular prices were very reasonable.  For example, the seared scallop entree costs $22 regular.  I figured that the same dish of similar quality of ingredients and cooking skill would likely cost close to $30 downtown.  I wish the service would reflect better on the restaurant, but it alone does not detour myself from coming again when I am in the hood."}
{"text":"Great food! Ordered the shrimp and crab cake. The wild scallops was huge and cooked perfectly! My friends orders the fish and it looked delicious. Dessert was great too- loved the pecan pie!  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"New Croque Monsieur is fantastic. Fresh baked Brioche toasted and full of ham and Brie. Yum! If you make it for breakfast their espresso French toast is also a treat.  Very busy and can wait. Quite a bit for your food, so best to go early."}
{"text":"This restaurant moved into the 'hood where I work recently and I have to admit I was hesitant to try it since I wasn't crazy about what was there before.

I had lunch there today and ordered the burger and fries.  It was a very delicious burger.  It didn't seemed to be processed and the bun was soft.  The fries were good too ... crisp and salty.  The aoili had a bit of a bite (I was okay with that).  It is a great value for just $10!

My colleagues had chicken and they said it was good too.

The servers were friendly.

Our only negative concern is that it seemed to take a lot time for the food to come out.

I'll be back!"}
