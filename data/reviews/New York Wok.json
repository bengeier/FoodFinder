{"text":"I ordered delivery from here, got an order of General Tso's Chicken extra spicy, pork lo mein, house egg foo yung, and crab puffs.  The General Tso's tasted very slightly burnt. I'm pretty sure it's the extra chilis. If you skip the extra spicy, it might be fine. It also came with a couple florets of broccoli. That was new.  The crab puffs were solid, but quite greasy - No surprise and not a problem."}
{"text":"Breing raised in the NYC area, I have got to say this place is one of the best around. The New York City style food  cannot compare to any of these places. The prices are just at the right price for the quality of the food . General tso's chicken is BOMB!!!! JUST LIKE NY STYLE. Now here is the reason its at 4 stars.... How does the menu say \"minimum $12\" but charge an additional $2 for delivery ??? Overall great food and friendly people."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this restaurant the orange chicken was awesome the hot and sour soup was a little spice to it But it was really good and they delivered all the way to 39th Ave. and Northern."}
{"text":"Great food.  Now, friendly family.  No MSG which I love and healthy selection too.  Our favorite Chinese delivery for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered General Tso's Chicken and Vegetable Lo Mein.  Both were flavorful and deliciously spicey."}
{"text":"We have loved this place for several years but I think it must of changed hands!!  This place is no longer New York style!!  The fried dumplings, egg rolls, and the crash puffs are frozen and the main course let a real bad aftertaste and the fried rice was actually plain brown rice!!  Very sad that the food is no longer made with love -  we asked when placing the order if there were new owners when we placed our order because they didn't recognize the numbers from the menu and they said no. After receiving our dinner, we called them back and they admitted they just took it over and insisted they advised us otherwise!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, tasty food, and clean restaurant!   Thanks to our awesome server John. He knows his stuff so don't be afraid to ask for recommendations.   Enjoyed: chow fun and honey walnut shrimp"}
{"text":"We used to love this place and would order once a week. It was family owned and the young girl answering the phone already knew our order. This was our first try after it was sold in April and we will not be back. Nothing we ordered was worth eating, the sauce was horrible and we were given chicken when we ordered shrimp. I called to speak with a manager who of course was not in and was met with little apologies and no resolution. If anyone knows where the original owners went I would love to know."}
{"text":"Closed since mid Oct . . .Message still says \"Will be back Oct 27\" We did get sick one time from the food, but otherwise it was so good we kept coming back. Closest thing to NY Chinese Food I've found since moving here in 1999."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would!  Apparently after April 5 it has new owners and new COOKS, because the food use to be great and now it taste HORRIBLE!!!  Everything is drowning in some sort of sauce which seems to be a universal one, gross!  Also, no one there speaks English either, which is very convenient when one calls to complain.   You've been warned!!!"}
{"text":"This awesome foodery has new owners. Being from Philly where there is a real Chinatown with tons of restaurants and stores, etc, we know good Chinese food. Used BeyondMenu to place our order for pick up.  Efficient, quick and owner called to ensure accuracy or special requests.  The food is awesome.  Veggie Egg foo Young, Veggie Mu Shu, Won Ton soup, Chow Mein, Lo Mein and ribs.  The food was fresh, veggies cooked just right and very very flavorful. Will do it again and again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the food, but sadly I couldn't. The crab angels hardly even taste like real crab puffs. Not only that, but I ordered a shrimp dish and it hardly had any shrimp in it. Fried rice was mediocre. Would not return unless I had no choice."}
{"text":"Small sitting area but for take out, no complaints. Children working the desk area no adults to be found, great size portions though for the price..."}
{"text":"So. Over all the food was good. Even though they didn't know the difference between chow and lo mein noodles. When we called back to rectify it, the person who answered clarified it it with ease. Although, even after she said as such, and stated the lo main was chow mein. Backpeddled and self corroded herself to say the lo was chow, completely diametric to what she just said. Competency of the order should be OVER clarified to whom ever answers."}
{"text":"First time here but I have to say I am not a fan! The spring rolls were cold but I don't believe they would have been any better if they were hot! The only thing I enjoyed were the crab angels! Certainly nothing was good enough to call Chinese food! Clearly Americanized! Will not return! For a suggestion of delicious Chinese I would say New Asian Kitchen is delicious!"}
{"text":"We tried this place last night for the 1st time. I got my favorite, Orange Chicken. When going to pick up the food, I was impressed by the clean smell of the place. Although nothing fancy, it works well for a pick up/take out establishment. The prices are a little cheaper than a few others we've tried in the area. The food ranked right up there with a really nice dine-in establishment. While the portions were a little smaller than other places, they worked!! A woman could still make two meals out of the dish, for those who try to watch their weight. Bottom line, we got the combo option with pork fried rice and an egg roll. The egg rolls really stand out. They taste much better than those sold at other restaurants. We have found our place for Chinese Food:-)... We'll Be Back!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place a zero! The food was awful they put the sauce for the sweet and sour sauce on the side? Which I don't know why, I ordered the fried rice they gave me white rice, the rice was flavorless the soy sauce couldn't even make it good. Would def never go back unless they made some major changes! DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT BLAND FOOD. I didn't think I could ever say that about any Chinese food place in my life. The staff were pretty friendly and understanding but they need to get the old cooks back the food is awful,terrible,horrible, bland."}
{"text":"When this place came under new management, I was disappointed.  The food was nowhere near as great as it used to be.  It was terrible. Time passed and they started to get more positive reviews so I decided to give them another try.  Order: Crab rangoon, fried dumplings, pork eggroll. Eggroll was the biggest I've ever seen!  Didn't have cabbage filling like I'm used to.  Seemed to be more of a green lettuce type filling. Crab puffs had good flavor. Fried dumplings were small but the filling had decent flavor."}
{"text":"In a word...AVOID!   Food was very bland and tasted like it had actually been made in a wok in New York and shipped via bike messenger to Arizona.  Egg rolls and rangoons were stale and had almost no filling.  Boneless spareribs were black around edges, extremely hard and had almost no flavor.  Fried rice was over cooked, and was little more than white rice with a bit of soy sauce.    Although the dumplings appeared homemade, they were very bland, and shriveled like they may have been reheated.  They were not even folded like a proper Chinese dumpling but simply folded in half.  Food at local cheap ($5) Chinese buffets are far better than anything I got from here.  I have noticed that the reviews for this place used to be excellent, at least until the last few months.  This usually indicates new owners, cutbacks or a staff that just doesn't care anymore."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get some lunch but it looked a little dirty so I decided to go elsewhere. Good thing I did because after checking the health ratings I am surprised they're still open- a 27!?!? Really? That is freaking scary! No recent award either."}
{"text":"Their lo-mein and crab angels were delicious. The orange chicken on the other hand was quite possibly the worst kind I've ever had at any chinese place. They are tiny cut up pieces of chicken, breaded, and drenched in the most sugary orange sauce I have ever tasted, I mean literally I didn't even taste ANY chicken, it was just the orange flavor. It's so sweet that I didn't even want my soda and grabbed a water bottle.  With that being said I think I would come back to this place but definitely wouldn't get the orange chicken again, perhaps I'll try the boneless spare ribs next time."}
{"text":"We had a delivery dinner last night. It did take a while for it to be delivered. The food was of poor quality. My Sweet n Sour Chicken was very dry and brittle. My Husbands Cho Pou Chicken was stringy and dry. The egg rolls were dry and tasteless.  The NEW MANAGEMENT (OWNERS) Need to take lessons from the PREVIOUS OWNERS when the quality of food was much-much better. The delivery time was more prompt.   CJD'A-Teague"}
{"text":"I am from New York!!  I've eaten authentic Chinese food in Chinatown in NYC and have had the best throughout........so this is an amazing surprise for me!!  I ordered Moo Shu Pork Combo, BBQ spare ribs appetizer and they delivered quickly, food was still hot!  The order takers were smart and fast!!  The driver found me and didn't get lost!!  And  the taste is Delicious!!  I look forward to making this my regular Chinese Delivery place...............Thank you NY WOK!!!!  I highly recommend!!  Ann F."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast, I know good Chinese food and to find that here is next to impossible. I'm used to joke in the wall sketchy Chinese restaurants being the best but this one exceeded all my expectations, the food was excellent and the portions for a dinner were huge. I just wish I was in delivery range! Either way I will be eating here a lot more for sure!!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with other review was sooooo good for delivery prior to new management... then not so great... egg roles come free with combo.. there small, there mushy don't order them.. My mushoo didn't have plum sauce... my chow fun, was chow mein... the angel puff things are good... nice enough people and service  but I miss the old food"}
{"text":"Having come from Philly, I am fussy about Chinese style food. I believe that chow mein is a VEGETABLE dish, not a noodle dish.   Won-ton soup has firm, not mushy wontons Mu-shu pork had the right balance of flavors. Chicken chow mein was just right, with a good balance of vegetables.  It is a bit of a drive, but worth it!!!"}
{"text":"First time coming here, food was amazing. Fried rice lacked a tiny and I mean tiny bit of flavor but it was still pretty good. We got the Mongolian beef combo and the sweet and sour chicken. They were absolutely good. The girl working there was very helpful with recommending things and had a nice personality. Eat In or carry out you get the same wonderful service, of what I observed when I was waiting for my to go order.  My number one go to place when I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"Great place. Very friendly staff. Ordered carry out at 9pm not knowing they actually closed at 9 and they stayed open till 920 for me. Got the orange chicken dark meat with the fried rice. The amount of food they give you was ridiculous. I had enough for two meals and then some. Chicken was tasty and so were the egg rolls and cheese wonton. The fried rice could have been better though. This is probably my go to spot for Chinese since its on my way home from work and also for 8 dollars I have food for two nights."}
{"text":"New York Wok offers pretty good General Tso's Chicken, Orange Chicken and Sesame Chicken. The Cantonese chef does a great job serving up crispy chicken with flavorful sauce. The char siu fried rice was mediocre, so I recommend ordering the entrees with steamed rice. Take-out Chinese."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC originally, it should be illegal for a place like this to be allowed to use my city's name. Instead how 'bout they change it to Pittsburgh because the food really is the Pitts (no offense to all you from Pittsburgh, sorry.)"}
{"text":"Nothing good to say about this place. 2nd time here to give it a 2nd chance. Fried rice is flavorless and microwaved. The egg drop soup was so terrible. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is not what it used to be. I have been going to this Chinese carry out for over ten years. Just recently, it has been taken over by new management and new recipes. When I ordered the orange chicken, I barely got any chicken. All I tasted was the overcooked batter that they fried it in. There was nothing special about the fried rice and the food taste bland. I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon. The original family that owned this place needs to come back!"}
{"text":"Great staff. Great service. Great food. This hole in the wall has some great plates as well as lunch specials. Crab puffs and the honey walnut shrimp were phenomenal. Whether you are dining in or taking out, ot feels homey inside. Staff can tell you about the food and make awesome recommendations! My go to when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Terrible... Tasted like bad frozen food and only made my stomach toss and turn the rest of the night. Will never order here again."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Lunch specials are priced very well.  We like it. We will be back. We did a take out today."}
{"text":"Ate here once and it was just a big greasy mess. Never going back."}
{"text":"This place is really good and the price is great too. I am really picky when it comes to eating Chinese food. I know most places hate me because I take out stuff and add stuff and get a lil extra this or that. By the end of ordering I am sure the person on the other end has already spit in my food for being so difficult lol. This place though the people are soooo nice and they always get my order right no matter how difficult i make it I love it. The delivery people are very nice too and the amount of food you get for the price is awesome.  I really like that I can get it delivered since I am sick a lot and can't get out so this place is my go to place for delivery. My favorite dish I have had is the Schezwan beef and the fried shrimp. If you are looking for a good delivery place in Glendale I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it negative stars!!! Use to love this place....now its worse than horrible.... No flavor... No spice....holy grease....and last but not least holy tummy ache...... Won't ever go back......sad sad sad"}
{"text":"So sad. Ate there a couple weeks ago after it was sold. I won't be back. Now I need to find a GOOD Chinese restaurant around here again. They had been my favorite, now they just suck."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout today from here.  The delivery driver was prompt but that wasn't the problem.  The driver stunk like stale cigarette smoke so bad i almost gagged.  You could smell it on him a few feet away.  He handed me my food and left.  As I was walking to the kitchen the smell still lingered.  i realized it was the bag the food was in, it smelled disgusting.  I took the food out and began plating it.  I began to smell the smoke again and realized my food completely stunk like the cigarette smoke.  It was foul, everything stunk like it.  He obviously was chain smoking with the windows up while bringing my food.  That has to be one of the grossest things I've ever dealt with food wise.  On top of that when I called, the lady informed me there are no refunds and that nobody else had a problem with him smoking in the car while he delivered food.  My first experience with New York Wok will absolutely be my last."}
{"text":"The young guy that works/owns this place is excellent.  Great personality, helpful, friendly, and an asset.  However, tonight I met the older lady.  And this is what went down.  On a $18+ order, included were 2 eggrolls, I ordered online and requested extra mustard packets.  She gave 2.  I asked her for more and she told me it's a 1 packet per eggroll policy.  I said I usually have 4 packets per eggroll.  She told me that was far too many.  She said this one time she would give me 2 more, but that's it.  Are you kidding me?  A penny packet of hot mustard is limited?  She didn't even give me an option to BUY more!!!???  This place changes hands so many times maybe because the owners haven't a damn clue about customer service and what MATTERS.  You want to deal and argue and make $$$$ profit $$$$ above all else and you wind up arguing with a valuable REGULAR over a one cent packet of mustard.  This is outright insane.  She should never be allowed to deal with customers again.  I'm done with this mom and pop nonsense.  Get your act together!!!  If you have  no business owning a business, don't own a business!  Clueless.  So absurd.    I want a remedy."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago, therefore I have high expectations when it comes to Chinese food. So far this is the best place I have found out here. The Carb Rangoon were pretty much just cream cheese and no crab, their chicken in the fried rice was rubbery and I didn't end up eating it. Their prok egg rolls are great though! We also did not get any fortune cookies in our to go bag. It was a little pricier than it was worth in all honesty. Still on the hunt for a \"good\" chinese place in AZ"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food around! Family owned with a comfortable atmosphere. Johnathan is such a star waiter, very friendly and helpful, very attentive to our needs. He recommended the orange peel beef which was delicious. We also liked the crab wontons, vegetable fried rice, and walnut shrimp. The Thai tea was the perfect amount of sweet, too. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"We were surprised and impressed of this little Chinese Kitchen. The food was absolutely delicious and service was so quick and nice. Highly recommend this place for everyone who likes Chinese food. Thank you . Helena K"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I get their hot and sour soup at least 4 times a week! And there pepper steak is bomb!!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from these guys a few times, the food isn't too bad but they screwed up an order in the past and told us they would credit it. When trying to redeem the credit the person over the phone fought tooth and nail against us. She insisted to have the manager call us back. Basically completely refusing to comp one entree that was screwed up in the past. Never ordering here again. (Not to mention the first time was curry chicken without the onions, there were onions and it sure didn't taste like chicken or anything relatively close)"}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall take out joint. You could eat in, if you want, but there is little ambiance and only 4 tables.   I'm incredibly particular and after walking into another Chinese restaurant down the street that was dirty and super stinky, I was scrutinizing this place. It's clean, in fact, it's super clean- at least on the surface. I did smell some backed up drain or something, but ... well, semantics I tell you.  I ordered the garlic shrimp combo. Oh my goodness. It was really good.I actually don't even like Chinese food all that much, but I thoroughly enjoyed it all. I'm really happy I popped in.  Plus the family running the place was very nice. They're children ran the cash register, while mom and pop cooked the food... They're living the American dream. That's what it's about. I will visit again."}
{"text":"New York Wok is great. We order from here almost weekly. Not a single complaint, ever. Veggie Lo mein and hot and sour soup are delicious."}
{"text":"Did not like this place at all.  Saw all the positive reviews so we ordered delivery.  I live 3 miles away and it took almost an hour.  Mongolian Beef was very bland and we ended up throwing most of the meal out.  Beef was chewy and coated in a slimy corn starch substance that tasted like paste.  Shrimp with lobster sauce was more like egg drop soup with shrimp in it.  Shrimp were large and cooked properly, but flavor of the rest of the dish was off.  Eggrolls were crisp and hot, but the crab puffs were soggy and greasy.  I might have ordered the wrong dishes on the wrong night, but doubt I will order from here again."}
{"text":"Flavor is there but the portions you get for the cost isn't proportionate. The large teriyaki chicken could feed 1 person full but wouldn't really be satisfying enough for two people. It's also a little strange to have such young children working the front desk. I mean that girl maybe was 13 and the boy maybe 9-10. Probably won't come back...."}
{"text":"I quite like this place a lot.  Haven't been in, but have had delivery several times, and it's very very good.  I'd recommend it in a moments notice.  I get the kung pao chicken and it's always good.  I also get vegetable fried rice, and it's so delightful.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch today.  It is located in the Albertsons Center where I sometimes shop and I had seen it getting ready.  This location used to have a water store in it.  Nothing really special about this place.  It is geared for takeout as there are only 4 tables.  They could add 2 more if they wanted.  Food was ok.  The pork fried rice had bean sprouts and onions in it which seemed different to me.  I had the General Tso's chicken lunch special which came with pork fried rice and my choice of a soda or soup ($5.75), I chose hot and sour soup.  It seems to be a family run business.  The person at the counter was having a rough time understanding much English and had to be helped several times.  Minimum credit/debit order is $8 so if you are by yourself getting a lunch special you better have cash.  I only took a picture of the back of the menu, inside is over 100 more items.  They are open until 10 PM which could come in handy sometimes."}
{"text":"I ordered food from this worthless establishment last night and when the idiot finally got to my door he starts yelling at me saying that I gave him the wrong address. After a couple of minutes of this mindless delivery guy arguing with me I show him a piece of mail to finally shut him up and get my food. Then he complains to me that I didn't tip him!! Umm hello!!?! You come to my house yelling at me when you are clearly wrong then expect a tip!? I don't think so. Then I call the place to complain to management about their deliver guy and they didn't care at all about what happened. The food was horrible and the service doesn't even deserve to be called service. If I wanted to be yelled at by an Asian man I'd  join a karate class. This was the worst place I've ever paid money to in my life. A complete waste of time and money"}
{"text":"We have been ordering takeout for the past 4 yrs on New Year Eve, this is our way of celebrating the coming of the new year, food has always been excellent and we are looking forward to this New Years  dinner,,"}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of hole in the wall \"Chinese Food\" restaurants, but this one is definitely better than most. Portions were good for the price and everything was actually pretty good.  There were a few reviews saying that the it was \"bland\" or the consistency of the food was bad. Sorry to say this, but it isn't a Panda Express with doughy-breaded meats and blasphemous proportions of sauces and salts. In all honesty, the food was really good. There was no overabundance of sauce or salt, and everything flavored just right. Some of the dishes only come off as \"bland\" if you eat some of the richer flavored foods first. For example: the egg drop soup. I order the Sesame Seed Chicken and after eating that, the soup tasted bland until I cleaned my pallet where I was greeted by a nice light soup.  In addition I tried their Wonton Soup, General Tso's Chicken, Orange Chicken, and Home-made Egg Roll all of which were equally as good as the next. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant for those who want to eat good hole in the wall food.   P.S. Just a tip, for hole in the wall restaurants either ask what their specialty is, what is ordered the most, or what the employees like to eat. Those tend to be what the restaurant is best at making and thus the best tasting."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food at this little hole in the wall, mom-n-pop joint.  Fresh ingredients and great flavor.  Will definitely be back, best option is take out!"}
{"text":"After trying several other Chinese restaurants in Glendale and convinced there were no good ones on this side of town - we took a chance and tried this last night. It was excellent! I'm not sure if the bad reviews are old or the people just don't have taste buds but this is great food comparable or better than any I've tried in large city Chinatowns."}
{"text":"Worst Orange Chicken ever. Oil  that it was cooked in was bad and you could taste it. Chicken was small and dried out.  Just horrible.  Don't waste your $$. Owner does not really care when I told him. Staff seem friendly. Who ever is cooking this monstrosity should retire or get fired.  I was hopeful because this place was close by. My first visit and last. No  glasses for your soda no ice and cheap plates and utensils. Really only take out kind of place.  Not my idea of anything good."}
{"text":"This place has changed hands, and it isn't necessarily for the good. The food feels more greasy and heavy, and the chicken dishes that I didn't ask for the sauce on the side were swimming in it. The sesame chicken has a strong, not fully pleasant taste. The pork fried rice is lacking in any vegetables other than an enormous amount of green onions. The pork eggrolls had no crisp to the vegetables inside. I'm regretting my order and cannot recommend the new take on this place."}
{"text":"NY Wok is my new go to place for Chinese food.  After my old place kept getting complaints from the health dept, and trying a few other places I just didn't care for, I saw this one when I'd be going to and from the supermarket, so gave them a try.  First thing I noticed was how clean the place was.  Not much of a place to eat in, but you could if you wanted to....I prefer take out, just wanted to actually see the place first.  Their hot & sour soup is wonderful and they are the first ones I call when I feel a head cold coming on.  Clears it right up!  Their orange chicken is very good, the egg foo yong, the lo mein, the crab ragoons - everything we tried has been delicious.  They deliver and I know it's coming from a place that takes pride in their appearance, keeps the place clean, and the delivery, service, and most importantly, the food is always great.."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery for the first time from this restaurant last week and it was great!  You can do all of your ordering online which I thought was super helpful - and - they delivered until 10pm!!.   We had the sweet and sour chicken (5/5), chicken with cashew nuts (5/5), curry chicken with onions (4/5) and spring rolls (3/5).  The rice came with each of the main dishes and was delicious!  The curry did not taste milky-ish as I have become accustomed to and enjoy, but instead was on the watery side and had a lot of bell pepper flavor. Overall good and I will definitely be back in person!"}
{"text":"highly recommended, came within 30 mins, the food is hot and smells delicious, taste even better"}
{"text":"sad face they changed owners. no more ny chinese food. this was my favorite low key stop ."}
{"text":"Moving from NY 2 years ago was a big change, didn't realize how big untill I tried the pizza and chinese here. This is the first place that actually knows what duck sauce is.... must be honest what got my attention at first was the name of the place.... food is really good for a take out chinese food... delivery is quick... prices are decent... overall good place to try!!!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent And very welcoming sadly you get what you paid for. The service didn't compensate for the greasy overly sweet chicken. The spring rolls were very good, but the egg roll didn't compare. It was chicken, shrimp, and pork which should never be put together. They definitely proved right to that statement. In conclusion to this review I recommend to not spend your $10 on this place, but look to Panda Express for better tasting food."}
{"text":"**updated review with new management** we looked forward to our weekly Chinese night meal from our favorite place. Sadly disappointed!! The Mongolian beef had way too much pepper it was barely eaten. The garlic chicken was WAY over seasoned with garlic. The egg rolls that used to be the best ever are now only stuffed with what looks like cabbage and carrots. The shrimp with lobster sauce is now a brown sauce that is mainly huge chunks of green bell peppers. The rice that comes with the combination meals tastes just like unseasoned white rice. It has egg and peas but absolutely NO flavor at all. Now, after all of that the ONLY thing I did like was the crab puff. Sad sad day. Now I gotta find something else to eat for dinner."}
{"text":"I love the crab Angels :)  and the sweet & sour sauce is totally different than what I've tried before"}
{"text":"Have not been back here since the new owners took over & based on the reviews I'm glad I haven't. If anyone wants a new chinese place, check out Grand Dargon on 47th Ave & Dunlap!!!!"}
{"text":"So we waited until the Re-Birth of New York Wok under New Management   Restaurant layout. .. Has more seating and they stream lined the counter. Moved the soda fridge by kitchen.   So we had the order and waited, and waited  Food was hot....... And then the wheels fall off! I love the food here and I have Lost that Loving Feelings   My order of Kung Pao Two. ... About the strangest,  light on sauce, heavy on fishy Shrimp! Uncoated Chicken. TOO DAMN MANY VEGETABLES! !  My sons order General Tso Chicken NOTHOT. .. WAS HOT. ... GREASY, STRANG  CONSISTENCY. .  THEY HAVE COMBINATION. ..hot to fet them is a Ancient Chinese Secret.   My wife asked if the Sweet and Sour Shrimp was heavily coated... They  brought out a very nice Butterflied Shrimp with a perfect amount of a tasty Tempora coating.   I have to say today was a sad, sad, sad day.  I thought long and hard and decided. .Its time for ua to Cook Chinese. I have several recipes and only need a few things. Thanks to a strong Asian Restaurant Supply selection of places to buy.  I am sure we will find our Happy Asian Place.  Thanks for the poor food and inspiration to cook it My Damn Self.  Ni Hoa, Hop Chung Mao"}
{"text":"We ordered here for lunch and I thought the food was really good.  Probbaly the best Chinese food I've had since I've lived in Arizona.  I had the General Tso's chicken and it was very flavorful and just a tad spicy. It was also very tender.  The meal came with rice and broccoli, which I enjoyed.  The portion of chicken was pretty generous considering the whole meal cost  $6 with a soda.  Ordering on the phone was a bit difficult due to the language barrier, but that just makes the food all that more authentic."}
{"text":"The other food that i ordered but neglected to mention was my moms and she ended up getting food poisioning ..save your money! your wallet and stomach will thank you"}
{"text":"Best American Chinese joint in the area. Orange chicken is bomb."}
{"text":"We search and search and search for good, inexpensive chinese food, and I think we have finally found it.  So far, the food has been great.  Not TERRIBLY impressed with the shrimp Mei Fun, but I think it's just because it wasn't what we were expecting.  The Singapore Noodles are AMAZING, egg rolls are great, and they have the best hot and sour soup (which has no meat) of any of the local places around here.  I understand the critics who say the food is bland - because most places put so much cloying, thick, syrupy gook on all of the food, one can't experience the freshness of the vegetables, and the simplistic cooking style that should go into these dishes.  They get it just right, in my book at this place.  YUM.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came home from work and there was a take out menu on my door. I ordered orange beef walnut chicken and the crab puffs and i got a free liter of soda to be delivered. The orange beef had a fluffier batter than i have had before. It was fresh and tasted good the walnut shrimp was good sized and tasted great. The crab puffs were some of the best i have had. Opted for lo mein and it was lo mein. Ive lived in the neighborhood for 24 years the 2nd best orange beef i have ever had is no longer available, out of business. This was different but really good. They get five stars because it was take out. They dilevered freshness, flavor and promptness as best as one would expect, especially for the.neighborhood. if you want the.best chinese food you have ever experiemced this isnt the place but if you want some really good take out or delivery i dont think you can go wrong.  I cant comment on dine in. I think i found my new chinese delivery place and look forward to train new dishes."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Seemed kinda average. Deep fry anything and it'll have flavor."}
{"text":"Yay! I've finally got a local Chinese joint again. After a hit and miss journey New York Wok has become my go-to spot for Chinese American delivery.  It's all been very good here, but I'm a freak for their egg rolls, mei fun and chow fun. If you haven't had mei or chow fun before you have to try it here. However their most killer-est dish is the roast pork lo mein. I'm typically disappointed by pork dishes from AZ Chinese restaurants; regardless of the dish the pork is usually bland and/or dry. That's not the case here, the pork is seasoned and roasted well. Spicy beef it a close runner up to the pork lo mein (and is really done justice by a night in the fridge), so be sure to hit some up as well.  I've only taken out or had delivery to date, so I can't speak to the wait staff but the counter and delivery service has always been prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Food tasted like shit there cooks should take lessons on cooking Chinese food or do u call it that order a shirmp dish only got 3 maybe 4 anyways who ever brought da place is gonna lose it due to very bad food do us all a favor and sell da place stop taking people hard earn money"}
{"text":"Best Chinese takeout in the area, hands down. They also deliver which is a plus for those lazy Sundays when I don't wanna leave the couch. Their food is always hot and fresh. All their appetizers are awesome. I recommend their egg rolls, spring rolls and steamed dumplings. Good lord, that's some good stuff! All their noodle dishes are delicious! I prefer skinny noodles so I get the Mei Fun, which are the thin, clear noodles. My husband likes the Shrimp Lo Mein, which is the thicker noodle. They are NOT skimpy on shrimp either. In fact, that reminds me.... Word of caution: portions are HUGE! So consider that when ordering because we always wind up with leftovers, which isn't a bad thing. As long as they're around, I'm coming here for my Chinese food."}
{"text":"This restaurant has changed hands yet again but this time, not for the better. This was our favorite place for Chinese food but now I think I need to find a new place. The crab angels were bland but had an odd fishy taste, not a sweet cream cheese/crab flavor like they used to have. The egg rolls were small and lacked flavor. The sweet and sour chicken was soggy because it was swimming in sauce. I loved that they used to keep the chicken and sauce separate so my chicken would stay hot and crispy. Also, the sweet and sour sauce had a strange flavor to it. The dumplings also weren't as good as they used to be. Definitely disappointed in the change this time!"}
{"text":"I have never been to the actual location I just order delivery.  The first time I ordered I was surprised at how quickly they got to my house.  The food was very hot and seemed fresh.  The food was good and my husband loved the homemade hot mustard.  He always gets the barbecue spare ribs and enjoys every last bite along with the fried dumplings with plum sauce.  I honestly think if I wasn't around he would just drink the plum sauce.  I get anything chicken and I do the combos.  I have had the sweet and sour, General Tso's, Sesame, and orange chicken.  All of the combos come with pork fried rice and the dinner ones come with an egg roll while the lunch comes with your choice of egg roll, soda, or soup.  My daughter gets the vegetable soup and eats every bite, I have had the wonton which is good and the egg drop.  My husband had the hot and sour and really enjoyed it.  Whenever we are short on money and high on hunger we order out from here.  It is really one of the best delivery Chinese places in this area."}
{"text":"I actually really liked this place, surprisingly enough. AZ lacks any good Chinese restaurants but this was not too bad. They have new owners and managers so maybe some of the bad reviews do not relate anymore?   The girl who works here is wonderful. I ambled in early one morning and just wanted some spicy soup because I was sick. I spent a while in the restaurant chatting with my new friend who was very helpful and knowledgeable about food.  The lunch special was cheap and pretty good. I love their homemade hot mustard. ( It is hot!)"}
