{"text":"Was here a while ago, ordered the pho dac biet and took way to long to arrive,also tea IS NOT FREE, after waiting about 15 mins the pho broth was tasteless all I could taste was msg,msg,msg,MSG!!! It was basically water and salt this is definitely not authentic pho   Also another thing I didn't like was that pho only comes in 1 size I know most people can't finish a large but that's the only size they have...you gotta have size options! There are other places to get good pho but this is not the place"}
{"text":"New in everything but the Pho is still traditional, made with care and of high quality ingredients.  The soup base is piping hot and a lingering umami feeling in your mouth proves lot of substances are used in achieving this.  I like the one size bowl pricing and the bowl portion size is very large and consists of perfectly cooked al dente rice noodles. And side plate of bean sprouts are not swimming in water.   All said, the only thing needs improvement is that the soup is top up a bit too much making the ingredients appear drowning a bit.   Lucky Easterners now need not venture out to Spadina or Ossington to have a Pho fix anymore!"}
{"text":"Just ate lunch here. Ordered the house special...tastes great. Really like the broth. Fair price. Would come back."}
{"text":"Service - Extremely attentive and kind. We made a few customizations and discussed allergies and they were very polite.  Price and Quality - Great considering the price. The soup isn't salty and the meat amount is good.  Tea - really good quality Jasmine tea for free and not waterdowned piss like other asian restaurants."}
{"text":"Do you love Salt and MSG? Come for all you can eat MSG. The soup quality is bad and they are cheap. I usually never write reviews but this is the worst restaurant I've ever been to that I have to spend 5 minutes to warm you guys.  1. I called them asking for extra sauce and they give me what other pho places usually give at the minimum, 2 mini containers of sauce.  2. The iced coffee has absolutely no sugar in it. Usually iced coffee in a Vietnamese restaurant has condensed milk in it. McDonald's iced coffee is a much better option.  3. The broth is full of msg. I was only able to sip a quarter of the given soup until my lips felt numb/uncomfortable.  4. I don't know why the noodles wouldn't break up. They were in chunks so I decided to heat it up on my stovetop and it still wouldn't break no matter how long I cooked them for.  I ordered Ubereats from here and I highly warn you all not to come here."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly , amazing food and great service !! The spring rolls are a must have and the spicy seafood pho is breathtaking."}
{"text":"The friendly staff is no more and the chef is gone also...there is a grim looking lady now who doesn't reply to greetings and generally acts like I do not exist which is all the cues I need to seek my lunch elsewhere...its a shame since when it first opened it was by far the best Vietnamese on the strip... When will business owners learn that without consistency and good service they have no business at all?"}
{"text":"Good portions, good flavor, and good service. We love the various pho, and have tried a few of the appetizers. They're good, but might be what's dragging down the reviews. The pho is flavorful and tasty."}
{"text":"Found this gem on yelp! Came here on a Sunday night and it was a bit quiet! Found out they just opened just about a month ago! We ordered the fresh rolls! Yummy yummy! Also got the beef balls pho! It's a huge bowl! Pretty good as well! The owner is super nice and welcoming! Would definitely go back! :)"}
{"text":"Well, I'm impressed with this new pho joint. Broth was a little salty,  but other than that on point.  Only one size, so bring your appetite or get a to go box. Our favorite place sold across the street, and im still under the weather, so we tried this place. We were not sorry, as this now under new owners. The old place lacked warmth, great job on the renos.   On point pho and super fresh salad rolls, perfect lunch."}
{"text":"Such an unauthentic Vietnamese restaurant. The service was extremely slow and their Vietnamese iced coffee (ca phe sua da) tasted watered down... The food was not great either. Tasted very plain... Please cater to your customers better rather than ignoring them... I asked 5x for my coffee... and got it near the end of my meal. I couldn't even finish my vermicelli because of how disappointing it tasted. Sorry but please check out other pho competitors and step it up."}
{"text":"I've only ordered from this place off of Uber Eats but wow....... am I in love. I get the beef ball pho with extra beef balls and is it ever yummy. SO good. I also order the pork rolls... once again- YUM. The first time I had them I was drooling. Last but not least I had the avocado smoothie, and oh my Lord is it ever perfect. Not too sweet, just the right amount of creamy. I've made it a habit to order at least 2 with every order.  Not only am I obsessed and impressed with their food, but I am also impressed with their consistency! Everything I order always tastes as delicious as it did the last time and it just leaves me wanting more. I've ordered from this place well over 10x now, and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Was not impressed by their pho dac biet. It was very mediocre. Their menu is surprisingly small for a Vietnamese restaurant. The worst part is I left this restaurant super thirsty and I basically had to drink litres of water afterwards, there may be lots of msg in their soup."}
{"text":"We were sad to discover Pho House - the former restaurant at that location - was no longer there.  We decided to give the new Pho East a try as we wanted to find good pho in the east of Toronto. Once we were seated and given menus, we were pretty much abandoned. We had to grab the waitresses' attention to take our order of our \"regular\" Pho Chin. Our verdict?  Way, way, way too salty with an unpleasant aftertaste.  Served warm, not hot, so the added bean sprouts stayed crispy.  And there's only one size bowl served, so plan accordingly.  To clarify, though, tea is free (other reviewers said it's extra and it is not).  And guess what we found out when we left?.. Pho House (the previous restaurant) moved just across the street!!!   I won't return to Pho East, but glad to know Pho House has reopened!!!"}
{"text":"Really slow service, creepy vibe from the male owner towards my gf. Honestly food is okay but hard to enjoy in such a bizarre atmosphere.   Portions are small. Grilled chicken with rice is the same size as a kids meal at Swiss chalet honestly."}
{"text":"Will not being going back. This is not a Vietnamese restaurant despite the name. Food was Chinese style and very mediocre. Prices are not a bargain either. Tried the grilled beef bun which comes with a fried roll. The filling in the spring roll was very paste like and mushy so it was hard to tell what was in it. It was not tasty at all. The beef was not sliced properly and was all different sizes with some that would need a knife to cut up. There was no fresh mint or coriander and the vegetables were mainly shredded iceberg lettuce. The accompanying sauce was missing the chili component and was vinegary. Some of the vermicelli was cut up into small pieces!. What!? I have never seen that before. Other dishes included shrimp and rice...shrimp was dry....where was the sauce? The kids liked the General Tso chicken and rice but why was this even on the menu?"}
{"text":"Really poorly done... we had pho and bun and both were less than mediocre. I don't know how they think it's ok when they are surrounded by other much better pho places. One size only, pricey, and overall the taste was inferior to competition. Both the kitchen and service seemed pretty inexperienced."}
{"text":"pho east open in the location that use to be pho house.  pho house moved across the street. From the outside and inside, its probably the best looking pho restaurant in east chinatown.  that is where it all goes down south. Tea is not free, i was wondering why they didn't bring me tea when i first arrived.  chopsticks, spoons, tissue was not readily available like the other restaurants where it is so convenient just to grab your own.  pho noodles was only 1 size... me and the kids ate the same size... i wanted extra large, they wanted small, we both got large... how was the pho? nothing really special, especially not special enough to make me pay for tea... no beef balls in the beef noodle special. overall disappointed.  Staff was friendly, but with so many pho places offering more, if they don't change, they will struggle because the locals will not come."}
{"text":"Well, noodle and meat were ok, and a generous meat portion for sure! Staff is friendly. Place is very clean.  My main problem was the broth.... too salty and homogenous, not flavoured otherwise enough, to the point that I wondered whether it came from a can and I doubted it was home-made... also, only one size (large) for the bowls of pho (or you can take the small kiddies one, which comes with a small cha gio with it on the side). total = 2.5/5."}
