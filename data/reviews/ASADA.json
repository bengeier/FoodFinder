{"text":"Finally this place is opened, it was worth the wait. I've been here 3 times in the last week. Their homemade salsas, Jamaica, and Carne Asada Fries are . I would recommend."}
{"text":"So... I was a bit turned off by this place when I first arrived. I went through the entrance that is near the bar and it smelled like cigarettes, right away I was skeptical. Then I look through the menu and see that the items are limited. Not what I was expecting at all. However, the food and customer service made up for the two bad points in the beginning. This was my husband's second time coming here and he really likes it. I'm a little more picky and pay attention to everything. So when I say they earned their five stars, they've earned them. The food was delicious, and the employees were very attentive and accommodating. The wait to get our food was a little longer then we'd like, but that is what happens when you arrive 4 minutes after opening, so I won't use that against them.   Tip: Use the door on the side of the building. Otherwise you'll be greeted with a potent cigarette smell."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly greeted by the waitress. The place was empty. Maybe with time it will get more business. I ordered the 4 taco plate with 4 different meats and they were all EXCELLENT! My wife got the carne asada burrito which was also very good. For a place really hidden from the Street, it's worth looking For! We will most definitely go back there soon. Also, the green sauce is great but the red was pretty hot... not for me but be ready... haha!"}
{"text":"Very good fresh food. Not greasy. Nice family owed place. Check it out, you won't be disappointed. And to respond to another review. Robertos... I don't know what your talking about"}
{"text":"Just left this place.. and the service was great! The young man was so nice and even though I ordered my carne asada nachos to go he still brought my daughter and I some chips and salsa and water. The carne asada has such a good flavor and the nachos are so good!  I live around the corner from this place and I'll be coming back for sure. Can't wait to try more items off the menu!"}
{"text":"Small place, small menu, but the service is great and the food even better you won't leave hungry GIVE IT A TRY #smallbusiness"}
{"text":"Food and service was great, the server and the chef had great customer service we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Badly located next to a gaming business. My coworker and I decided to check out this place during our lunch since we work and live in the area. We were greeted by the strong smell of smoke coming from the business next door. Next we enter the restaurant,  for a Mexican place... it does not give the Mexican vibe nor the alternative rock music playing in the background. The food took forever to get to us, there was only 1 other table to serve, since we were on our lunch time we decided to get the easiest thing, burritos and tacos. Like i said it took forever. Once the food arrived I bit into My burrito and instead of tasting the food I tasted something weird, I smelled my burrito and I got the smell of gas... YES GAS!!!! I felt wmbarrassed for the business, we both boxes to go so that theg wouldnt noticed we didn't eat the food, but we tossed it afterwards. I will not be going back here, I rather go to Roberto and get me some whitewash Mexican food until a real Mexican places emerges"}
{"text":"This place is really good! I got the pollo asado and my husband got the carne asada tacos. Both were delicious. Highly recommend the pollo asado! The servers are really nice. They frequently came to our table to ask about napkins, drink refills and if we needed anything else. It's definitely a family owned restaurant. The chef came out asked how the food was and to make sure we were happy. Highly recommend!! We will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Their carne asada is on point and delicious! Prices are also reasonable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Off to a great start for this to be a new location. Very close to my home, I would suggest going a little lighter in the salt content but still really great and such a great portion for the price !!! I love it! Very friendly staff. Wish the music wasn't as loud but I think they're on their way to something GREAT"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the carne asada nachos and the pollo asado platter (which takes a little longer to cook) but it's worth the wait! The chicken was SOO good. Will definitely come back to order take out again. Super nice owners and staff also!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband got the asada tacos with rice and beans and they were great!! The green salsa was great, we are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food on this side of town. My wife and I go here at least twice a week, the portion sizes are great for the price and their chicken is amazing. Fast and friendly service, you can either dine in or take out."}
{"text":"First of all GREAT SERVICE ,... felt like I was eating at moms with her good Mexican traditional food. Well portioned food at a low price ,.. highly highly recommend this restaurant. I have a New Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"this place is great.  food great. customer service great.  today was my second time.  I will def be back!"}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint!  From the chips/salsa to the ASADA tacos, everything was legit!  The horchata was on point too!  Staff was friendly, place was clean and the prices were great!  Will definitely be coming back...with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Tacos were good, rice and beans I didn't like.  Not a fan of the seats. I bigger person and it's not comfortable.  They close to my house so if I need tacos to go, I would go back"}
{"text":"The food was excellent the prices are right  They need to put signage in windows by front door !  The seats are hard plastic hard to sit through lunch"}
{"text":"After seeing the Yelp reviews I figured I'd give this place a try. I ordered carne asada fries, and they were \"okayish\" (yes I said it). If I could provide them with any feedback, it would be to prepare all the fries fresh, because they aren't good cold. At least not to me. The host that took my order didn't effectively communicate with me, especially considering it was my first visit. Anytime I visit a new restaurant, I always inform them that its a first time visit. I highly doubt I will ever come back. But I am still on the hunt for some awesome carne asada fries!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican authentic food!! Big portions!! I highly recommend this place!! We'll be coming g here a lot!!"}
{"text":"This place is a really good like hole in the wall restaurant. You go in and it doesn't look like your average restaurant lol like seriously it's very plain and there's just tables and chairs and two TVs. But the food and service was amazing, and that's all that matters. We came on a Saturday afternoon, there was only one couple dining there when we arrived. Not busy at all, service and food was fast.   The food came with a complimentary chips and salsa and the red salsa was absolutely delicious. We both ordered taco plates. I got birria and Asada. The freaking birria was so amazing omg it was so juicy and tender. Best birria taco I ever had. But they only have it on the weekends so if you really want to try it come on the weekend. The taco plates come with 4 tacos and rice and beans. We both got all rice. The food was delicious period. And the prices are great honestly. Oh and their Jamaica is bomb!!!   It's been really hard to find good tacos since I moved to Vegas from Cali and this place really hit the spot."}
{"text":"My brother took me here when I was visiting out of town, raving about how good this place was. It didn't disappoint! I ordered a burrito with carnitas. It was delicous and flavorful without being heavy. I left feeling full without feeling like I'd just eaten a bunch of grease. Plus the service was GREAT. Water glasses refilled quickly (we're weak so we needed it hahaha), the food came out fast and the guy who served us remembered my brother from a previous time he came in. If I lived here, I'd definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Got the asada and chicken tacos and they were pretty good. If you live on the north side and don't wanna drive far for some yummy tacos, come here."}
{"text":"We have been here 2 times since reading the good reviews on a local magazine. They serve to Salsas a green and red the red being the hotter both very flavorful the first time here I had four different tacos all were extremely good last visit just a couple of days ago I had the ribs in green sauce which were very tasty. They do serve black beans so if you are not a fan you can have salad or vegetables in their place. We were served quickly buy a very friendly server just as we were our first visit our sun is local and he said he will bring his two kids back. I would ignore the negative reviews you see here because it doesn't match our two visits this restaurant is a keeper."}
{"text":"first of all it's not hard to find. the clear signs and two doors(one pointing to lola's) is easy to understand? i don't know why so many people are knocking stars for it being hard to find?  the inside decor is a little strange. you can tell they're working on it. i don't think they should go with the sit down feel. counter ordering would be better. they're trying to offset the high prices.   currently waiting at ten minutes for five tacos. i decided to try this place for taco tuesday. 4 other people here  the chips and salsa are decent. the red sauce is insanely salty however. i wanted an appetizer but they're all near ten bucks. to be a roberto's competitor in a low income area. they need a lot of help.   the tacos: i got three beef and two chicken  beef: felt like fatty pieces of meat. very chewy. i'd say a 7/10  chicken; great. light tasting. seasoned well. with some green sauce makes a great combo  overall i'd say it's a solid 3.9 with room to improve. definitely a good start.  probably wouldn't come here on any other day but tuesday. ditch the sit down feel and make it a more casual spot."}
{"text":"Nothing but the best. Came from the bay area to visit my family and she been coming here and let me tell you they are a bomb.  Love it. You have to try it."}
{"text":"Be carful what you order at this restaurant- The carne asada plate is ridiculous with the meat chopped up and little rice with beans for $15.00 plus tax. I can't believe at that they do not give tortillas. WOW!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open for awhile. I kept driving past it after the gym. Great quality good, excellent green salsa!"}
{"text":"Service was great, and you gotta try the Asada Fries! They were amazing, even some avocado sprinkled on there too. Definitely getting more here."}
{"text":"This family run small business makes a bomb carne asada, as the name of the restaurant would imply. We stopped here on our way back from Exotic Drives and got a burrito. Their carne asada is definitely a cut above (no gristle, great quality). Horchata was nice too."}
{"text":"Good service. Good food. Was a bit skeptical since we came on new years eve and we were the only ones there but it was great."}
{"text":"We went for Taco Tuesday, and let me tell you, these tacos are the bomb.  Generous portions for a taco night and full of flavor and fresh ingredients.  My wife and I both loved their salsa, green and red.  The green salsa is some of the best I've ever tasted.  I only deduct one star for their atmosphere, they need some help with the layout and seating in their restaurant.  But the food?  Delicious!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best little Mexican place around nothing fancy at all. The food was great , great flavor in it the service was good 1 person as server and prices were good. Had the carne asada burrito it was so delicious it was real food. I will be back that's for sure that's why I give it 5 stars*****"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this establishment. Waitress was very friendly and very inviting. We went for carnitas tacos and the salmon. The carnitas were very moist and tasty. The salmon fillet was a big serving and a ton of vegis. Usually it is the rice that makes or breaks a mexican restaurant for me. Theirs was very very good! Only a couple minutes from my house so I will be definatly a repeat customer. Interested in trying their torta."}
{"text":"so yummy! they are such nice staff and the food is cooked to perfection! I have loved everything we have tried!"}
{"text":"The food was ok.  Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad but it wasn't the best Mexican food I ever had.  Service was a little slow....  staff seem to favor the Latino customers more which was very evident even to the kids. Would I come back?  Maybe but I would go out of my way to"}
{"text":"Come on folks ... friendly greeting, but the deco doesn't say \"Mexican here\". Your sign blends in with the business next door - change the neon to Blue or Green; you have a blank canvas next to the register, how about a nice big menu!; and get decorations that speak to customers to \"sit down, relax and be amazed at our food\". Took our order home and the wife loved hers and mine was not that great. I expected better after seeing some of the previous reviews. Will give them another try though."}
{"text":"GOOD Was a little apprehensive due to it being next to a bar...but totally unfounded.  The place is clean and the service is great!  I usually judge a Mexican place by the salsa...and they are totally on point.  Green was my favorite...the red creeps up on you after.    The order of tacos comes with 3 and not skimpy with the carne asada.  The price point is really good for the quality.  Very tasty...you can tell it's marinated well before being cooked to order.  BAD Could do better at advertising that it is totally separate from the bar...its a stand alone from bar...deceiving due to its shared entrance.  I think that's what puts most from coming into place....just saying.    All in all a great place to stop in for a quick bite...not many good Mexican restaurants in the area....well worth the stop in...will be back for the burrito"}
{"text":"Walked in and smelled like a hard boiled egg cracked and nexus there was 6 of us ... the waiter is obviously a child and while we waited for our food ... we had chips and salsa and then when our food came out we had to ask for utensils and napkins and ketchup and more salsa and refills . Here's a pic of the shrimp cocktail and no retried beans or pinto only black beans . My cocktail taste like ketchup and no lime or lemon juice . We all agreed it took way too long for our food. And we all agreed we're Not coming back here again ... I left my cocktail alone the shrimp is clean but the sauce is like thick ketchup."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time... I enjoyed it very much,,, will definitely return..  Bye Bye Robertos,, I have had a enough of the slop you fuckers serve... Try it,, Corner of Losee and Centennial Pwky."}
{"text":"This was an good ASADA burrito.  It was small in comparison to other ASADA burritos I've gotten elsewhere but still a good value.  Wish it was slightly bigger.  Their chipotle hot sauce was super good!"}
{"text":"My official rating: 3.5. I'm rounding up for Yelp.  Pulling up, the entrances confused me. There are two- one is shared with Lola's and reeks of cigarette smoke. The other is more to the left and takes you directly inside the barren venue.  It's kinda weird when you walk in. We actually weren't sure it was even open because one of the neon signs wasn't lit and there was no one in the place. All the way in the very back, a kind gal popped out from the kitchen and handed us menus. TACO TUESDAY SPECIAL! $1 tacos! I'm there.  I order 4 to go- 2 adobada, 1 asada and 1 chicharron. An asada burrito enchilada style was ordered by my partner in crime. They gave us a couple of extra salsas, limes and radish. Thank you for that! The green salsa is the truth.  The burrito was huge and was stuffed with meat, beans, pico, and rice. The flavor was reported as good but it was awesome that they were able to do it enchilada style. My tacos were good, too. I didn't care for the chicharron but I think it's because I had gotten it to go and it turned soggy in transit. The flavor was great. I'll give that a try next time in house. The adobada and asada were also very good.   This spot is kinda hidden in the corner of the plaza in the back. You might miss it if you're not looking for it because their official sign isn't up. The food is good and I'll be back for another taco Tuesday for sure."}
{"text":"Just passing through and found this place. I'm from LA so I have high standards for Mexican food. This place definitely fits into my book for a good burrito and great service."}
{"text":"This place is great !! First time here , service was Great. The menu is simple , but the food is excellent. The Carne Asada plate was huge and everything tasted wonderful.  The chips were fresh and homemade, as well as the Salsa.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We got the 4 taco plate. Carna asada was our favorite. Thee green salsa was amazing. Well definitely be going back."}
{"text":"So I basically been craving good Mexican food for a while since relocating from Cali. The young guy inside was very sweet and helpful but doesn't pay attention to details. They made my food twice good thing I'm the type of person to check my food before leaving . This places has a lot of potential however since my order was changed twice for Missing items  and incorrect meat. The rice and beans was extremely cold. Also certain bites of the rice was hard. The meat was very tender and juicy. I wish it had more seasoning even after utilizing the lime it was still under seasoned. They did however give me a extra taco for the inconvenience .  I would try this place again because I definitely see the potential. I will give it another try in a few more months I'm assuming maybe there's a few kinks because it's a newer place. Also you don't get greeted to the best smell they are in the same entrance as Lo-Lo's and it reeks of cigarettes . However once inside the restaurant it is fairly Clean."}
{"text":"All I have to say is this- F**k ROBERTOS! And just go to this spot! Their Asada is soooo good, it's the best carne asada I've had!! Seriously."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fresh, flavorful, clean, and excellent service. We tried the carne asada tacos and chicken tacos. Both meals came with rice and black beans. The tacos were all yummy but I favored the carne asada! Our son had a kids mini cheeseburger meal with fries and all of it was made fresh and was also very good. Chips and salsa were also on point. The red sauce is a bit spicy for me, but the green was perfect. We finally have a delicious restaurant in the neighborhood. Eat there! It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Best tacos de birria in town... The flavors are there... The location is always clean."}
{"text":"My husband and I live in the neighborhood, literally walking distance. We've been meaning to try this new place since it opened. We were on our way to Roberto's for taco Wednesday but saw the ASADA lights and decided to try it out and boy was that a great decision! My husband is a burrito man and order the asada burrito, 2 asada tacos and I ordered the chile verde plate. The server was friendly and when we ordered horchata and he went to the kitchen and realized it was not going to be ready right away (yes they make it fresh!) offered us another agua fresa no charge until the horchata was ready. The food came out and did not disappoint! The place is new and isn't fancily decorated but I'm there for the food not the paintings on the wall so for us it's not a problem. Bye Roberto's! Hello ASADA!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. We live so close and I was excited to get another Mexican place here. We stopped in about 5:30 on a week night. There was no one else in the restaurant. We ordered two meals to go. The wait was at least 30 minutes. The guy who took our order did bring us chips and salsa after we were waiting about 20 minutes. But still. My tacos were good. Lots of flavor but not worth the price or the wait. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food for a great price. There should be a line out the door for this place. If you live in the area and aren't eating here, you have to question why."}
{"text":"I moved up the street from this place last month, and have been wanted by to stop in.  I had to run an errand today, and looked them up on here to see if it was worth a visit. I try to support the mom and pop places, and I'm glad I stopped after reading the reviews.    Ordered carne asada nachos. REALLY GOOD. Huge portion.  I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Pretty decent tacos , it's a brand new place that in my personal opinion needs some more work with the menu , no desserts for example."}
{"text":"When we first walked in the restaurant, it was very clean and EMPTY and it was 5pm. Some of the staff was sitting around talking but as soon as we walked in they scampered to the back. The young lady who helped us was very nice and friendly. Fast service But the food was horrible. We ordered the carne asada fries. Fries soggy, very little meat and it was very dry,"}
