{"text":"A very nice little pizza restaurant. Quite cheap and suitable for students. The downside is cash only but it is worth it"}
{"text":"Very unassuming place from the outside, it was right across the street from where I was staying, on a Saturday there was a huge line around 7pm, thought maybe it was a bar. Looked it up and to my delight a very well rated italian resto!

Ordered takeout, eggplant parm/vegie lasagna/white pizza. Their white pizza looked amazing, got great reviews, so i went with that. Walked into the place and was instantly hit with the sweet sweet smell of an AMAZING Italian food kitchen. You only get that smell at primo places, I was happy before even getting my food.

Tip #1 -  this place is CASH ONLY. Maybe I missed it, but I don't recall seeing this on their website nor menu, But their is an ATM there.

The food is AMAZING, everything tasted great, was so damn delicious. The pizza is the unique offering -  IMO I think they use a shortening in their dough which gives the crust a semi semi puff pastry texture/flavor. It was really unique and appreciated, and especially on the white pie it went very well.

I would come from anywhere in the city to eat here, but if you're staying at the Trylon appts across the street this is a big plus being so close.

Great job Amelia's, please open another location in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Was known as Amelio's. Business has closed his door for a few time and reopened"}
{"text":"Very delicious pizza, nice atmosphere. Definitely should try pizza florentine."}
{"text":"I am EXTREMELY surprised this place hasn't more reviews. It's probably one of Montreal's best Pizza spot! Located in the Mile-End, this place will satisfy your taste buds. The price/quality ratio is quite decent and everything on the menu is AMAZING. If you can, have a Pizza and Pasta and share or if your alone, it's fine just take the rest to go and it tastes even better the next day ;) Oh and for the complicated ones like me, no worries you can also make your own Pizza :)


Pro's:
- Bring your own wine
- They serve you a nice house salad with your order (Making you feel less guilty for the delicious cheesyness you will end up having)
- The small pizza could easily be shared for 2 


Con's: 
- Cash only
- Kind of small, if your claustrophobic... but still very cosy setting.
- Closed on Sunday's"}
{"text":"Been coming here for almost 20 years and that's not about to stop!

Used to come here with my girlfriend, and now come with my wife and kids.

Same menu, same atmosphere.

Sometimes things shouldn't change and this place is a fine example."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  We ordered several small pizzas and shared for the table. Along with two bottles of byob red wine and the salads that come with dinner, we had a great meal."}
{"text":"Amelia's looks like a neighbourhood place to get a slice of pizza but I found it wholly lackluster. The pizza has an incredibly thick crust that doesn't have a lot of flavour. I love a good Hawaiian pizza but this one came with maraschino cherries inside the pineapple slices?? 

The service was very mediocre and they didn't take cards which meant I had to get cash out from the atm located awkwardly in the middle of their restaurant. Paying $20 for a personal sized pizza with minimal flavour and toppings is not my idea of a good meal. Would not recommend for people who are pizza lovers and for those who enjoy bold flavours."}
{"text":"worth the visit,  good typical italian dish at an affortable price close to the downtown area"}
{"text":"You could easily walk pass this restaurant without noticing its existence unless you were looking for it, because it barely has a sign and is located in half basement. Even so, this place is well known and mostly full as it has limited tables and seats. No reservation and cash only, but they serve excellent pizza. I especially enjoyed their chicken BBQ gourmet pizza, which was a little on the sweet side. Gourmet pizza are only served in one size, large enough for two unless you are famish. And if you have leftover, they will be happy to put them in a box, why waste an excellent food when you can finish the rest at home. Definitely worth a visit or just order to go, expect to wait though."}
{"text":"Amelio's has reopened as Amelia's and my life is complete! When asked what my favourite casual restaurant/meal is, the answer is, hands down, Amelia's. To the person who posted that this was possibly the best pizza in all of the province, I'd like to offer that it is probably the best on the continent. The pizza is the best, period. It's served hot (and that isn't as obvious as it sounds), the vegetables are fresh, and the side salad is crisp, with a tangy vinaigrette. If you opt for the subs, the vegetarian sub is chock full of fresh fare, not the stock green peppers and lettuce but rather eggplant and zucchini. As for their tomato sauce, I'm sure it's illegal. Whatever the secret ingredient is, it's kept me loyal since I discovered the place (as Amelio's) in 1994. Only caveat: I wish they were open on Sundays and Mondays! They don't take plastic, but there's a cash machine on the premises. They also serve Dr. Pepper in a can...the only way to drink soda! I wish I could give Amelia's SIX stars!"}
{"text":"I used to work as a waitress at this restaurant's original incarnation (Amelio's est. 1985) in 2003 when I was at university so I can you that not only is the food DELICIOUS, this is a lovely family restaurant that treats its staff very well. 

I thought they'd closed down so I was ecstatic when my boyfriend found out they reopened as Amelia's with the daughter at the helm, how wonderful to see this awesome family business continue past its 30th year! I love supporting local companies and this is the real deal.

Now on to the food! There's a reason that every crop of McGill students learns of Amelia's and quickly sees it as a staple. Not only are the prices reasonable, it's BYO and group-friendly for before a big night out. It was not uncommon when I worked there for groups of 8 to show up with a couple of boxes of wine and have a great time before hitting the night life. Now I happen to prefer a better quality to drink myself, but love that this joint is casual enough to cater to that crowd and nice enough to suit my needs as a young professional as well. 

The white pizza (5-cheese) is a MUST. I highly recommend sharing one small, medium or large with your table as it's a little intense to eat alone but absolutely TO DIE FOR. You must try it as nature intended, but a great hack from my waitressing days is to ask them to add tomato slices & garlic for even more flavour. Just adding mushrooms is another fav. 

The Florentine pizza with artichoke hearts and spinach is also amazing, and often gets overshadowed by the white but very subtle and delicious flavors. Only available as a small, so bear that in mind! The vegetarian is delicious and has a sauce base that includes eggplant. The Reuben pizza is basically a smoked meat sandwich in a pizza, complete with sauerkraut and mustard on the side - definitely not for the faint of heart but we'll worth it if you love meat and want the adventure. If you're a first-timer I'd definitely suggest splitting that with a more standard pizza,  though. Or the White :)

You really can't go wrong with the pizzas, and any small can be done in whole wheat dough which is great if you wanna be a bit healthier. They aren't intended to be Italian-style thin crust pizzas so do be aware of that. The crust is fluffy, buttery, almost pastry-like (I believe they use Crisco shortening in the dough) so expect more of a New York style slice. I almost never eat crusts from pizzas but I always finish theirs, they're so good!! 

The little salads that come with each order are lovely and give you that valuable extra greenery before say, eating 5 melted cheese on dough!! And their subs and pastas are great too, but the pizzas really do shine here. 

If you get dessert, the cheesecake was always my favourite, and all desserts are made in-house.

Note that it's cash only, so come prepared! One of my fav things to do is get dinner here before catching a rep film at Cinema Du Parc. They stop taking customers at 9 (but you can be seated until 9 and stay until 10) so plan accordingly.

You will have an awesome meal, promise :)"}
{"text":"Delivery order to Parc and Mont-Royal here. Made an order after everybody had talked about the old Amelio's that this place was. After 1:40 hrs since the phone call, I had to call in and cancel the order. Apparently, the delivery guy was \"on his way\" for 45 min. For a typically 6-7 min drive, that's far too much. On this night, Parc avenue was closed for a marathon, and hence I would totally understand being a bit late. But, being in that traffic earlier, it shouldn't have added no more than 10 min to the drive. It was completely unacceptable. Since no money was exchanged, it was a painless cancellation order, though."}
{"text":"Good spot if you like American style (thick) pizza. Had the penne arrabbiata which was very average (and full of olives, which is not typical) but the half sausage and half mushrooms pizza was very good. Had the cheesy garlic bread as well as a starter, which was good but the cheese wasn't broiled enough. The tiramisu for dessert was yummy. Also very convenient that this place is BYOB. Ca$h only.

{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago and it was seriously the best meal I've had in 2018 so far! 

I've had my eye on Amelia's for a few months now and finally dropped in for a dinner date on a Friday night. We arrived around 7 and waited around 15 minutes to be seated. Once seated, we were warmly greeted by our waitress and were given an ice bucket for our wine (BYOB!). I knew beforehand that I wanted the famous white cheese pizza and hubby created some concoction of his own. Within minutes, we were given the side salads which were delicious and a welcome balance to the carb/fat overload that was to come. Despite the restaurant being jam packed, service was quick and we got our pizzas in no time.

Honestly, I have never tasted a pizza SO amazing in my life (well maybe except for the stuffed pizza in Chicago..) - the crust was buttery and flakey and just soooooo good you wanted to die and live inside it. The cheese mix was phenomenal... and by some stroke of genius, they managed to make this pizza not so heavy that you felt gross afterwards. So so so soooo good!

20 stars overall! Amazing food, ambiance and prices! Will 1000% be back and if you haven't been yet, I'm not sure what you're waiting for! Go! Now!! And bring me a slice back with you :D"}
{"text":"REVIEW FROM 2013/ AMELIOS: POSITIVE  Best pizza in Montreal, hands down!. Title says it all. Try the 5 cheese pizza, you won't regret it - one of the best things I've ever eaten! The pasta is very good too. Waiting for a table seems to be the biggest \"problem\" at Amelios so go early since they don't take reservations, won't seat a group until everyone has arrived and since they close early! Cash only."}
{"text":"The Ruben pizza was really pretty awesome. I would eat this again any day. We ordered the club pizza as well, but it left a little to be wanted and didn't disappear as quickly.  I would give a 3.5 if I could, but take points away for being cash only."}
{"text":"I got a small white (five cheese) pizza on a whole wheat dough. I would say a little more salt would be better! The salad before the pizza was amazing. And it is really different from other pizza places. The environment is cozy and the service is nice. But remember it's cash only."}
{"text":"La pizza est très ordinaire, niveau fast-food, pas pizzeria (mais avec les prix d'une bonne pizzeria !). 

Les ingrédients sont de qualité très moyenne, la pâte est trop épaisse. Les serveuses sont sympathiques mais parlent à peine français. 

Notre pizza a été amenée sur un plat brûlant, en équilibre sur un support glissant. Elle est évidemment tombée, et ils n'ont rien offert pour se faire pardonner (en en a perdu un tier).

Bref, c'est cher, pas très bon et géré par un pingre (pas de cartes de crédit, en 2015 ? Hello !!!).

À éviter."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY

Had the onion soup and mushroom pizza. Was really delicious. The mushroom pizza didn't have nearly enough mushrooms, but it was just too good to care. Their cheese is out of this world. Would come back any time."}
{"text":"5 slices on 5! 
They deserve around of applause due to having the best pizza in Montreal!
-quality Ingredients 
-unique 
If you're a pizza fan and are fed up with that cardboard crust and cheap cheese then give them a ring! The white pizza (Blanca) is out of this world (my personal fav) The amount of cheese they put on this lovely pie is super and they mix it with cheese of course, I can see why it's the most popular.
The Reuben is so unique I've yet to have anything like this i was craving smoked meat and boy did they deliver plus they give to types of sauces mustard and a sweet mayo which is hard to beat.
You will be extremely full but you will be overly satisfied."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have EVER had hands down! Visited from toronto for the Rogers Cup and we had to eat here every day because the pizza was soo good! You can also bring your own bottle of wine! Loved the ambience/ whole experience/ sweetest waiters/ and you get a delicious salad included as an appetizer!!!!! 

Note: cash only"}
{"text":"The pizza is quite good, prices are reasonable and looks like this low key but crowded place has been around forever. Will definitely go back for lunch"}
{"text":"Adorable family/neighbourhood restaurant. It's super cosy and inviting. You descend these little stairs and you're welcomed by the lovely smell of pasta and pizza.

Looking at their menu, I love that they offer you the choice of spinach vs white pasta. It's such a change because you usually never get to choose.

I ordered the spinach pasta with meat sauce and my friend ordered the lasagna. We shared both and it was so delicious! Their lasagna is so cheesy, warm, comforting, and filling. Their spaghetti tastes fresh and the meat sauce is so well made. 

I don't like that they are cash only but at least the ATM fees are just 1.95$.

A great place for a date, a friend lunch/dinner, a family meal, or a solo adventure!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service~ prices are reasonable. white pizza was quite good especially its crusts really delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a genuinely cozy warm spot that has great inexpensive italian food ..Amelia's pizzeria is a must go to place. This place definately deserves 5 stars. Service was super friendly and warm. The resto itself is small but great for a date night, family supper night or friends supper. Decor is lovely and feels homey. Now for the food..I must say there pizza was truly delicious!  Sauce and ingredients were fresh and tasty. This resto is also a byow which makes the whole experience awesome!  Most important...leave room for dessert....they have one of the best tiramisu's in the city!  Truly delicious and irresistible!!! Great for sharing! Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend, best friend and I have been staying nearby on vacation, and when hunger struck we thought we'd take the opportunity to get some non-NY pizza. You know, in the name of science.
Well while at Amelia's the smells wafting around us inspired an order of vegetarian lasagna in addition to a medium mushroom pizza. Again, for science.
Though we remain loyal to the greasy, ubiquitous goodness of NYC pizza, we've got to give it to Amelia's for creating a cozy environment with friendly service and very tasty food. We'll be using this data for future studies."}
{"text":"This place still rocks!  They were closed for a while and came back with a new name, Amilia's instead of Amilio's, but the pizza is as wonderful as ever and every meal still includes a complementary green salad.  Miam!  You should disregard the comment from 5/12/2015: THEY ARE STILL A BYOB RESTO.   :-)"}
{"text":"DROOL! Their food is literally dripping in ooey-gooey cheese goodness. We went tonight for #Pizzafestmtl. For my full review, please visit: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2017/10/05/cheese-lovers-rejoice/"}
{"text":"We walked a lot to get here. Our pizza was very tasty, cheesy, hot, and all about it made me enjoy it. Our waitress was very nice and we got seated right away! Maybe we were lucky, but it was definitely worth the walk from Old Montreal!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly impressed by this Italian restaurant. I went here a while back with my husband and some friends. Our waiter was very accommodating and i could feel that genuinely wanted to serve us well and make sure we have a good time. 

I ordered the lasagne, and was left astounded by how perfect it was. There was flavor, texture and a whole lot of cheese (yay!)

They also served us a little simple salad before our main course which I happened to try (I normally skip salads when I have a heavy main course coming). I enjoyed every bit of it and infact recreate the same at home often. 

I'm already excited to go there again and I would be lying if I say I didn't already decide what I want the next time I visit, the same night I dined here. 

Kudos to this place and the staff! Highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give Amelia's five stars is because of the main dish I ordered :(
I got the cheese Ravioli with tomato sauce. I was so excited because I love ravioli, but this dish left me hungry for a lot more flavor. 

It was so disappointing to eat this last because everything I received beforehand was so yummy!

I also ordered the French onion soup as a side (about $6.75)-- Wow wow WOW!! Amazing. You might not even need a main dish after this soup. 

Then, I had no idea but when you order a pasta dish (or probably any dish) you also get fresh hot bread with a side salad! 

The soup, bread and salad were my favorite parts.

ALSOOOOO, this is a BYOW restaurant, so do that. 
It makes the experience even more fun. 
Overall though, we were seated quickly and our waitress was very attentive to our needs. I was so happy we found this little Italian restaurant (-:"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and this place hits the spot! The lasagna is heavenly, the atmosphere is so comforting- it's like coming home. This place truly feels family run. Everything is cheesy with generous portions. Bring your own wine  Closed on Sundays. Cash only, but they have an ATM."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré l'endroit. C'était cozy, pas très bruyant.

La pizza était super bonne, c'est un excellent rapport qualité-prix!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok at best. $30 for a large pie and $15 for a pasta is slightly (or very) over priced. Then they hit you with cash only when the bring you a receipt... and that where the trouble really begins. 
We left enough for the bill and a small tip, considering that was all the Canadian cash we had on us (didn't want to pay to use their cash machine and give them more undeserved money). We definitely covered more than the bill. As we were leaving the restaurant, the waitress runs after us and says we didn't leave enough. We get in and it seems the money disappeared. It was clear that money was lost/stolen and they tried to take it out on us. When we refused to pay, the owner told us that this will be taken out on the waitress. I couldn't let that happen and they wouldn't exchange US money with me. I ended up giving the waitress $20 US seeing as the owner was willing to take it out on her and I felt bad. But that was really bad treatment of their customers and their staff. 
As we were leaving someone else who witnessed the story said that the same thing happened to them before. It seems that since they only accept cash they skim a bit off the top and then tell you that you didn't leave enough. 
I would suggest staying far away from this place. The food is half decent but they are willing to steal from their customers and fight with you after."}
{"text":"All your meals start off with a fresh salad with a heavenly dressing (it has cheese in it yum). And then they bring you fresh warm bread (even more yum). 

GO FOR THE PIZZA

This is why I have given the 4 star review. Their pizza is amazing, fresh and just such a treat - the portion are perfect too. Their pasta is nothing to give 4 stars over so just skip that part of the menu. 

Amelias is perfect for a date, or anything really. The atmosphere is warm and incredibly friendly. Just a heads up though - it's cash only!"}
{"text":"Fun, unpretentious, and full of locals. Bring your own bottle of wine, and relax to a delicious, home style meal."}
{"text":"I visited Amelia's in late July with my husband and his family. We ordered two large pizzas for our group; the vegetarian and the five cheese. The service was timely (we were after all their only customers at the time) and our waiter was friendly and attentive. The pizzas however were just OKAY.

It's not that they weren't good, but rather Amelia's slightly greasy pizzas stand at the border between fast food and proper restaurant food. They're good, but as I chewed through the fat, the fluffy crust and the cheese, I couldn't help but feel the same way as when I order a pizza from Pizza Pizza; doubtful of my dietary choices, and wondering if I might have gotten a better deal in terms of quality for the price elsewhere (the answer is \"yes\", especially if you are hungry for real Italian pizza). 

Amelia's serves American pizza. That's alright, so long you don't expect high quality food. It's good, but not great. I wouldn't backpedal if I was invited for dinner, but I will avoid going back again by myself."}
{"text":"Very cozy little operation. There are nine small tables, always see a line in busy hours. 

I had French onion soup and all dressed medium pizza. I noticed others having five cheese. I think it's their specialty. My friend knowing my taste told me it is too heavy for both of us. So I avoided it and kept wondering is it good? I like their bread, perfectly toasted. The French onion soup was one of the best. The pizza had too much sauce inside so that the dough was too wet to my taste. They offer complimentary salad. Yummy. 

This place is BYOW. Very good."}
{"text":"We were looking for Italian-style pizza - thin, doughy crust, a sweet, ripe tomato sauce, plenty of fresh bufala mozzarella - and sadly, this was not it. 

Don't get me wrong - it's good pizza, but more Canadian style: thick, almost shortcrust pastry crust, with heavy, cheddary cheese on top of the toppings, and lots of sweetness. 

I can't say it was my style, though. If you like thick pizza, perhaps it's for you!

We did get a nice, generous side-salad as part of the meal cost though - that was very nice. 

I do feel like this place (considering that it's in, or near, the McGill ghetto) is more for students! And for students, it's very good."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I tried in montreal and I would recommend it for everyone but beware... the owner is one of these cranky guys that doesn't smile to anything ..not even to kittens and puppies. Stay away from him"}
{"text":"This was a very Yammy Pizza ! I went with 3 friends we ordered 2 large pizza's and we couldnt finish them although they were super good. The price might be slightly high (about 15 $ for a small one or 25 for a large one) but the quality is worth it and as a starter you get a free salad that is nicely seasoned and really helps you to start your meal on the right foot. Also the atmosphere is very nice. Overall not cheap but a great choice for a bussniess or friend gathering meal."}
{"text":"**NOTE: CASH ONLY!!**

Came here for the pizza which did not disappoint.  It can be busy during the dinner rush so be mindful as the place isn't huge (you may feel a bit cramped in some tables).  However the pizza itself was stellar!

The 4 of us got a large Ruben pizza, and two 10\" pizzas (Vegetarian and a gourmet artichoke pizza).  The Ruben pizza was actually quite good (I've had some pretty mediocre ruben pizzas unfortunately) with a nice salty flavor.  It also came with a side of Russian dressing and mustard to help enhance the flavor.  Prepare your palate for a sodium overload though if this is the only thing you're eating!!  The vegetarian pizza was also delicious and helped offset the salt from the Ruben and had a wide assortment of vegetables on it.  

My friends like the artichoke pizza (I was beyond stuffed at this point so I didn't partake) and they also really enjoyed it be told me that the sauce was while delicious, incredibly rich (we had to take half of it home).  

The crust was light and buttery and was definitely good enough to eat on it's own!"}
