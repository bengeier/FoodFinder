{"text":"I love their vegan protein shakes! Chocolate Thunder is amazing. I'm not vegan but whey protein gives me an upset stomach. Their vegan protein is a five plant-source blend so the amino acid spectrum is excellent unlike just using brown rice or yellow pea. Their protein powder is also powerfully detoxifying. I know all of this because this place is right inside Partell Pharmacy and staffed by knowledgeable health coaches. They know a lot about supplements and helped me find a couple of awesome products that I really like. They have the protein powders and the greens powders, chocolate is my favorite, right there at the store. The health coaches will even give you their protein shake recipes. They also have metabolic assessments they can do and have health, wellness, and nutritional programs. I have also tried their Clean Green. It's a great way to get a lot of healthy greens with very little sugar. This is a truly healthy drink without all of the super sweetness and sugar overload found in most fruit-based smoothies. I don't eat nearly enough greens so having a Clean Green often keeps me feeling healthy and detoxified. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Samantha is soooo kind! Food is amazing. I definitely stop in every week during work and grab a smoothie, salad, or sandwich! Yum yum yum :)"}
{"text":"Found this wonderful little place by accident going into the pharmacy. I ordered the turkey/avocado wrap & was pleasantly surprised; was delicious & their homemade honey mustard is fantastic too. 
The atmosphere is pleasant, it's immaculate clean & servers friendly & knowledgable.
Give them a try. I'll be back"}
{"text":"This juice bar wellness cafe has some if the tastiest and healthiest juice drinks and smoothies I have tried.  I love the two refreshing green recipes and the Mocha Love or Chocolate Thunder protein  smoothies with a boost of MCT and Expresso powder will power you for hours. The health coaches and adjacent  Partell specialty Pharmacy are cool and incredibly knowledgable and helpful people on most any topic of health and wellness. A must stop!!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to Whole Foods for a smoothie and my little Spirit guided me to this hidden gem instead! I just love the internal guidance system (and yelp lol) for always bringing me exactly what I am wanting. It is kinda hard to find, but it is inside the \"Partell Pharmacy.\" The service is absolutely amazing. I love knowing someone friendly and bright is making my food cuz it always tastes better! Smoothie is delicious and the vanilla protein shake is full of goodness. They also have great looking wraps and vegetarian options! I will definitely be back when I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I just love this new juice bar! So glad you guys are open and have extended your days and time! Juices and smoothies are delish! Can not wait for you to start serving food! I am a flight attendant and you are right on my way to the airport! Plan to stop by every time I head to work... Get a healthy jump start to my trips! Thank you guys your place is awesome! Not to mention the beautiful,  friendly and knowledgable staff behind the bar! Thank you for making my road to life more healthy!"}
{"text":"I work around this area, so I'm always trying new things. I've been eye balling the Green Regime for a minute now just wasn't really sure what to expect. I decided to give it a shot today and ordered the spicy chicken in a wrap and my god this thing is fucking good. Every bite is so fresh and flavorful. Doesn't get you all bloated like most food places around here would. I'm definitely going to be coming back here more often! I haven't even tried the protein shakes yet and they look super good!"}
{"text":"Wandered over for lunch today and was offered a veggie wrap with home-made hummus, avocado, pepper jack cheese and a delicious cilantro sauce. The hummus had a nice bite to it but not too garlicky. I usually cringe when people offer me hummus (vegetarians staple, apparently) but the promise of home-made was too tempting to pass up. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great service, a hidden gem inside Partells pharmacy, love the wheat grass juice. Smoothies are Delicious, everything is made fresh.  A great value.  I highly recommend, open 9 to 6, skip the coffee and go green you will get an all day energy boost."}
{"text":"I love coming here for their fresh juices and sandwiches they have a full variety you could take it to go or you can sit down and eat.    Great customer service and whenever I'm in the area I make it a point to stop by"}
{"text":"Love that this is here. Hard to find healthy choices in Las Vegas. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES!
Nice assortment of juices and smoothies.
Friendly people, great service.
Hard to find,in Partell pharmacy near the Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"The company I work for had their health fair today so we ordered lunch from this place, it was very good, the service was great and the price was right! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Sam and Wendy are two amazing women. they cater to Paleo Diet and sugar-free needs and not only is there food tasty and delicious but it is reasonably priced and the presentation is beautiful. I always stop in to the green regime when I am going to the pharmacy to pick up a protein packed Shake or a green drink and the best paleo ranch dressing you will ever have in your life and will not be able to stop craving once you try it.  I also enjoy enjoy visiting with Sam and our wonderful fun conversations every time I'm in there picking up my green drink and ranch dressing.  see you again next time ladies!"}
{"text":"Great service..always friendly..delicious food and smoothies!!! If you haven't been you need to try it ..lots of good healthy choices of drinks..sandwhiches are very tasty..i haven't had anything i don't like..and there is 3 locations to serve you..love it!!!"}
{"text":"This food is so deliciously amazing. The flavor of the sauces, that are made fresh daily by the way, are so amazing and to top it off they are all healthy!! If you do the Paleo thing this is the place to go. You will not be disappointed. The smoothies the wraps, the salads and sandwhiches, you can't go wrong with any of them, they all are very tasty. Give them a try at least once! Another amazing thing is you can have the food order for delivery from most of the delivery services, Grubub, Postnets, Uber and others. Love this place and love the owners, they are amazing People!! Healthy food that taste great!!!"}
{"text":"So what led me here was the fact that I told my co-workers we need to eat healthier...I've been mainly going to Bowlology...anyway, about The Green Regime...I believe there's only 1 location and there's not a clear sign outside, you actually will have to enter a pharmacy called Partell Special Pharmacy.  I ordered a Chocolate Peanut Butter Paradise Smoothie. Tasted good, while my co-workers ordered wraps. No complaints at all. This was our first time here, but we will definitely go back. Sam, who you see pictured helped and was very nice. Overall it was a great experience. There's places to sit inside and outside. If you want something besides Jamba Juice and places like that, I'd give The Green Regime a try!..."}
{"text":"The chocolate thunderdome (I think that's what it was called) was a great drink. Normally protein drinks like that are chalky or bland. This had a great flavor and I could drink it casually! That cannot be said often!
Great staff, Camille and Charles were very nice. I'd like to go again and try more of their products!"}
{"text":"They're located inside the Partell Pharmacy so it can be somewhat hard to find, but they do have a sign outside the door. They provide a variety of different shakes and some times will have samples on the counter for you to try. I'm a sucker for their Chocolate Thunder shake. I docked a star because the drinks are pricey. Their employees are friendly and the service is great. They provide interesting nutritional books to read while you wait for your drink."}
{"text":"This place is great! Each time I come here I always order the Mocha Love! Lotsa Love! Healthy drinks and wraps!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and customer service are beyond amazing. The ingredients are as fresh as it gets and you can taste and feel the difference. I'm so hooked and will be a forever loyal customer."}
{"text":"Just have to say how much I love this place.  I like that I am able to call in my order and Sam has it ready for me when I arrive. I take great comfort in knowing that I am putting something healthy and nourishing in my body rather than eating crap. Must try the Bulletproof coffee!!! It has all of the ingredients you need to get your day started right."}
{"text":"I couldn't find this place for like 10 minutes. Why? There isn't a sign. It's in a pharmacy. Definitely fits the mood and the setting. It's so clean and quiet. Just like every other juice bar, it's healthy. They don't have many choices, but honestly they have just enough choices. They have one with berries, they have one with non-berry fruits, they have just vegetables, they have a chocolate and a vanilla drink. 
I can't really comment on other things about this establishment. There isn't much to it. It has a purpose and definitely serves their purpose well. It's a simple juice bar/cafe. What else do you really expect? There aren't many in the area to begin with. So if you're in the area, just go; especially if you don't already juice at home.

{"text":"Healthy grab-and-go lunch and snack spot, located inside Partell Pharmacy next door to Patisserie Manon. I've been to their other location and was underwhelmed, but this location has the service and food nailed- plus they're right by my work!

When you enter, you are greeted. Signage displays daily specials and new items. Sandwiches, salads, and protein boxes are in a refrigerator to grab and go. You can also call in your order ahead of time. Juices and protein shakes are made to order, sandwiches can be heated upon request, and there's a small dine-in area.

The buffalo chicken and chipotle chicken wraps and salads are among my go-to items, and the house-made dressings are flavorful. I usually don't do the beverages here, but the Vanilla Powerhouse protein shake is freaking delicious with a 4:1 protein to carb ratio. 

TIPS: Check in for your 15% Yelp discount!"}
{"text":"Truly amazing healthy protein drinks. This is a new location inside Partell on West Charleston. The owner is amazing! I am not one to drink a green smoothie but hers is amazing!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this juice place and was so glad I did! Best smoothies I've ever had without all the added sugar and junk that's bad for you. High quality fruits and veggies with a great friendly staff.  I grabbed myself a yummy South Beach Berry smoothie while waiting for my prescription at Partell Pharmacy. This little hidden gem is right inside the building, right next to the pharmacy. Definitely will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Got the turkey wrap added avocado on a whole wheat wrap w/honey mustard on the side. Pretty tasty. 

Will definitely return again. 

Would have given 5 stars. It's hard to watch people make the food without wearing gloves. Mine was made in the back. But watched the employee touch all over the sandwich made in the front without gloves. That was the first thing I had noticed when I walked in."}
{"text":"Green Regime markets itself as a \"wellness cafe\", and is fittingly located inside of the Partell Pharmacy. Space is open, bright, and clean, and there are some samples available. Menu offers a limited selection of juices, smoothies, protein shakes, and sandwich/wrap/salad options. Pricing is average to high: $8+ for a 16 oz juice, nearly $10 for a protein shake. 

Service was friendly. Items are made to order, so call ahead if you're in a hurry. Some outdoor seating is available. The two green juices are just okay- Clean Green has an overwhelming parsley flavor that I did not care for, while the Green Quencher was extremely gritty.

NOTE: Closed weekends! Don't forget to check in on the app for 10% off."}
{"text":"Wendy makes this place absolutely awesome! The cafe is clean, the food can be paleo, and if she has the stuff for it she can make you anything! She makes you feel welcome, and likes Star Wars (score)! She is what I love about small businesses!"}
{"text":"I just came in for a green juice but the menu looks terrific. The cafe is INSIDE Partell so it's real hard to find."}
{"text":"This was the 1st time we ate here and the food was great. Hard to find a healthy place to eat on the eastside. The owner Sam was very friendly and answered all our question about the menu. They are inside Partell Pharmacy just in case you can't find it."}
{"text":"They great juices and smoothies... All of which are much healthier than what you'd find at a typical smoothie joint. It is located inside Partell Pharmacy, so it's a little out of the way if you're not looking for it. The staff is super friendly and informative. The staff has been trained correctly and knows what they're talking about. The product is made from the best/highest quality ingredients. 

Try em out. You'll find something right for you."}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot excellent food and service!  All made to order.  We got the lunch special and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is awful, assuming you can actually find it.  They advertise on Groupon and Restaurant but they don't mention they don't even have their own store, they are actually inside a pharmacy.  They advertise that they close at \"6:00pm\" but good luck getting any food after 5:00pm since the person there is in such a hurry to book it out of there they clean their grille.  To make things even worse if you go there with your \"deal\" from Groupon or Restaurant (unless you're drinking 5 smoothies by yourself) then you can't even use up the mandatory $30.   Big waste of time, hard to find, sketchy hours, no thanks I own a blender."}
{"text":"Great food and healthy drinks. My first day going vegetarian and Samantha recommended me a delicious vegetarian wrap and thirst clenching ice tea. Definitely great lunch spot."}
{"text":"My massage therapist recommended that I stop by the Green Regime and get a Green Drink to assist my body in the healing process. So I walked in and met Samantha, owner/operator. Samantha was so helpful and explained what and how each ingredient helped our body. I decided on the Green Drink as it assisted with anti-inflamatory issues as well as energy. I would strongly recommend stopping by regularly and doing something good for yourself. it's good and good for you! Thanks, Samantha!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious - what a gem!  NOTE:  It is inside of the Partell Pharmacy.  Okay, on to how awesome this place is - the food is delicious!  So healthy and fresh - just what Vegas needs.  My husband and I got wraps and they were so good!  The owner is super friendly, was totally accommodating for my difficult order, and loved our puppy.  He loved her too!  Definitely check this place out!  Next time we are in Vegas, we will be back."}
{"text":"Super friendly, good food! Chipotle chicken wrap was pretty good, the cilantro lime sauce was actually yummy, thanks Sam!"}
{"text":"I have had mostly good experiences here and can say the food is exceptional. I appreciate the care they take in handling their customers and making sure everyone is satisfied."}
{"text":"I ordered the chocolate thunder and my friend ordered the Mocha Lover. Both of us enjoyed our drinks, I thought $9.50 for a 24oz was a little bit high but not terrible. I asked the  guy at the counter how many grams of sugar the drink had. His response was \"I have no idea\". This just isn't a good way to respond to a customer, ever. 

It took a while to find the store as its inside a pharmacy and the sign is tiny. The sign out front says \"grand opening\" on it, so I asked the guy at the counter how long they've been open and he said 5 months. I said, you know you're sign says grand opening, right? His response was something like \"well that sign wasn't my idea\". It seems like they need some training for their employees."}
{"text":"I work around the corner from the green regime & my CO workers recommend the wellness cafe for lunch. The office already had  a take out menu so I called and ordered a ranch chicken wrap. By the time I drove to the cafe my order was ready and the server was very pleasant. I will definitely go back to the green Regine for lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome food and drink items! Very healthy! With a mix of things they aren't as much! Very sweet woman owns and runs it! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"So I stumbled upon this place because I'm always looking for healthy delicious eats. I have a background in health education but have not always followed my own advice. LOL! Anyways, Samantha (Sam) is awesome!! She takes her time with each individual and I love that. So if you're in a hurry, call in your order. If not, just come in and give her a smile and get some good energy. Thanks for everything! I'll definitely be back. Love always, Genevieve"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here at the Green Regime.  I'm from out of town looking for my juice fix and the staff was friendly helpful!

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great healthy option while staying in Vegas! It was busy in the little place but we were helped generously. Loved all the attention to detail with sauces and flavors."}
{"text":"The homemade buffalo sauce is addictive! Quaint little shop so close to the Airport and the owner/operator is amazing and so friendly! It's a gem hidden in a pharmacy but it's worth the stop! Vegan shakes, paleo friendly. All around fresh awesome food. You better hurry in because they are only open 9:00am to 5:00 pm Monday-Friday. I believe they are on Uber Eats so order your office lunch and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great that you can get a healthy protein drink after a workout. I love also that they are in the Partell pharmacy."}
{"text":"This place has got some really good smoothies, wraps, and sandwiches. If your looking for some healthy eats try this place is out. The owner Sam is really friendly too and she is generous with the portions!"}
{"text":"Visiting the area, and wanted something healthy close to the airport as I was leaving town. The lady behind the counter was surly and grumpy, like she has a pebble in her shoe and blames the customers for it. I ordered a juice and a sandwich and it came to $20+. That would be expensive but ok if both were stellar. However, the sandwich was made with GOOD ingredients and a terrific sauce BUT ungenerous in portions--absolute bare minimum amount that could cover the bread.  For $9 you should get a BIG generous sandwich. It felt like a lady with a stone in her shoe made it--not a happy sandwich. The juice...just bizarre. I got a large in a cup around 8\" tall. Of that, literally 7 inches is frothy pulp with less than 1\" of actual juice. I commented on it and the woman growled \"I don't do cold pressed juice.\" I juice at home, and know it does NOT require a cold-press to make juice that doesn't end up as sludge and pulp. You need good harp blades and screens to strain most of that out---a little bit is to be expected but not 95% pulp and sludge. 
Anyway, I threw away more than 1/2 the juice...I mean if a lame chain like Jamba Juice can make juice that's 3x better than what seemed to be a locally owned little joint, that's just sad.
Someone needs to tell the owners that the lady (manager?) they have serving customers needs either antidepressants or another job....and to strain their juice better...and add some more meat and cheese to their sandwiches. Otherwise I'll lay my bets that by the next time I come to Vegas they'll be out of business."}
{"text":"Wow, what a hidden gem. This place is located inside of a pharmacy. We had a bit of trouble finding it but we're glad we did. They serve up all kinds of salads, wraps, sandwiches, & smoothies that will wow your tastebuds but also promote health and wellness. 

We tried the Chipotle chicken salad and the buffalo chicken wrap. The owner is very friendly and will answer any questions you may have. She makes a homemade type of aioli sauce for the wrap and a sweet, citrusy salad dressing for the salad. She puts all the sauces on the side so the diner can decide the portion size of the sauce and/or dressing. We live a bit far from this place but we will definitely be back when we're in the area again. Yummy!"}
{"text":"The Green Regime is part of a pharmacy. It looks a little weird from the outside, not your typical smoothie place... Once you are on the side, it looks more like a smoothie place, though. Kinda weird, but ok.

I went in 1 hour and 10 minutes before closing. Nobody was there. After 3-4 minutes, a head appeared from the kitchen. The woman told us that she couldn't make any food because she 'just turned the grill off'. She was adamant that because she was closing soon, she couldn't do any food.

Apparently, a wrap requires a grill (news to me!) or at least, a wrap requires more than 1 hour and 10 minutes to make? I hope not!

We all left. If somebody cannot be bothered to work within the last HOUR of their shift, they obviously cannot put that effort into doing their job. Who knows what food or drink items we would end up with... Probably would have skimped on ingredients so that she could go home early.

If you want a pricely smoothie inside a pharmacy, sure, go here.

Bottom line, is that there are much better places with better atmosphere and staff that do their jobs. 1/10."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I get a shake from here about once a week and it is delicious. The service is always fantastic."}
{"text":"This is a must try if you haven't been here! The first time I went i was impressed by the food and customer service. Everything is very fresh and i'm looking forward to exploring the entire menu. 

TIP:
If you're in a hurry you can always call in your order for pick up. :)"}
{"text":"This place made my time in Vegas amazing. And I will continue to order from here again. This was another place I learned about by searching \"pressed juice\" on Postmates. And I am so glad I was connected with it. 

I could eat their roast turkey spinach wrap every day forever. And that is exactly what I did here. I ordered it and a green juice every day. It was perfect. It came and felt clean, organized, made with care. Portion size was great and food was delicious. I just cannot speak highly enough. I am so, so happy I found this place. When I return I will order again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love the quality and uniqueness of the selection. Love the owners. The Green Regime has been a staple to my nutrition goals for a couple of years now and I am grateful that there is a local small business where I can stop in and grab something quick and nutritious on the go M-Sat. Give it a try. I love the Chocolate Thunder and the Beach Body and my son and husband love the PB & Chocolate Thunder. Plus, I am obsessed with the greens they use here. Call ahead if you're in a big hurry."}
{"text":"Oh YUM!  I work nearby and have gotten to know Sam a bit as I try to eat healthy & support small business.  She has such a knack for sauces!  The BBQ wrap is amazing!  I ordered one yesterday!  Big chunks of chicken & avocado and I never would have put peppercinis in there but they were delicious & perfectly spicy!  Here's the best part - it was so large I put half away for today's lunch!  Be sure to stop by and let her know your tastes & dietary needs, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Chocolate Thunderdome...MmmmmM  These smoothies are so tasty and less sugary than the chain Smoothie places. It's located inside the Phartell Pharmacy. Both of the employees are so friendly and energetic. It was fun to hang out with them while enjoying the smoothie. :)"}
{"text":"It is hidden inside the pharmacy , I'm sure a lot of business is gone because of it . Either way it is an amazing place."}
{"text":"We were hosting a fitness week at our high rise condo tower and enlisted The Green Regime to come out and blend to order their smoothies for our residents. From start to finish Wendy was a ton of help and had everything setup and ready to go for after the fitness class. 

I personally ordered the Vanilla smoothie and thought it was fabulous. I also tried the Tropical and the Clean Green, both were really great healthy options. What I like most about these drinks is that the sugar content is low compared to other chain smoothie shops. These drinks were FRESH and good for you. 

All of the residents gave very positive feedback about the drinks they received and were very excited to have them onsite. Will definitely use them again in the future."}
{"text":"I work near them and was looking for a new healthy lunch option.  The reviews inspired us to give the Green Regime a try.  Located inside the Partell Pharmacy, the place was very clean and modern.  The service was very nice and the food was exceptional.  Our juice orders were great and the wraps and sandwiches were excellent. My buddy said the egg salad sandwich was the best he had ever had.  For three people the cost was $38 with blends."}
{"text":"Great menu, great service.  With so many generic and shitty restaurants in Vegas it great when a small business such as this one actually cares by making quality food with great ingredients and creative healthy menu items. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing juices the clean green and the peanut butter thunder are super nutritious and filling! And Wendy is such a sweetheart! Fan forever!"}
{"text":"I was going on my lunch break and wanted something on the healthier side. So I figured I try the Green Regime. 
It is a little weird it is in a pharmacy place but it is quite and clean.
I ordered the Totally Tropical Fruit Blend. I'm not a big fan of oranges but it also had mangoes, bananas, flax seeds and coconut shreds and coconut water. So I thought. Why not? It is so light and refreshing! And you can barely taste the Orange! Owner said it has been a popular one. And I can see why 
For lunch I got the Chipotle Chicken Wrap. She gave me a side of a honey lime cilantro sauce. And OMG!! The wrap alone is great but add the sauce!!! Lord have mercy!! 
Definitely will be back and glad I can order in advance and then swing by and pick it up. 
They do have delivery service through grubhub and other delivery service's."}
{"text":"Wendy, the owner, is the sweetest! She was so accommodating regarding my special juice order. She went above and beyond to offer me options to get my juice order just perfect, letting me sample it, & even straining the extra pulp. They use Organic Produce whenever possible. I will be back! Hours are M-F, 9am-6pm. Located inside the Partell Pharmacy (Eastern & Russell, beside Psychic Eye book shop). So happy I found this hidden gem! :)"}
{"text":"Nice lady - great customer service. She tended to my needs! I'm feeling really sick today and she made sure she gave me what I needed to hopefully best this cold sooner than later. All natural, mostly organic."}
{"text":"Great find inside the Partell Pharmacy! Sam is the gracious owner and her creations are excellent. We picked up Beach Body Berry fruit blend and Clean Green blend to drink, along with two Hummus Protein Boxes for our trip to Red Rock. 
The drinks are made fresh with whole food ingredients, the lunch boxes are made fresh. A stop well worth making. 
Bonus- I had a sample of her Chocolate Peanut Butter Thunder drink - taste like a dessert but ssshhh, it's healthy.  She also makes her own almond butter!"}
{"text":"Great little juice bar near airport. Love that they use a vitamix to liquefy so I got the pulp! Not organic but the owner strives for a quality product."}
{"text":"This place is great! 

Not only is the person behind the counter knowledgeable and aware of the benefits from the food they offer, they also have really really great healthy options. 

From wraps to sandwiches the paired with healthy juices and smoothies - this place put together some awesome combinations of options

Eating plant based is hard sometimes, especially where not everyone have truly embraced it. The Green Regime is a great solution to that as well as I feel a heavy contender with the surrounding options. Definitely recommend this establishment for the healthier side of things in your life! 

Will be frequenting this restaurant as well it is just minutes from the business area near the airport which already is complicated if you're looking for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb diggity! Just met Sam the owner, and this chick knows all things blended! Ordered the Clean Green and the Totally Tropical - all I can say is #YUM! This cafe is certainly a hidden gem (inside Partell pharmacy at Eastern & Russel). The Green Regime is going to become a regular spot for me. Anytime I need a juice/smoothie fix or any tasty lunch! Do yourself a favor and check it out. Say hi to Sam. And have some damned delicious food and drinks!"}
{"text":"I eat here fairly often. Always fresh, made to order, delicious food. Huge portions!! The cilantro lime dressing is unmatched in taste. The owner, Sam, is so friendly and fun every time I see her. Great interaction and she always informs me of specials or new recipes she is coming up with. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's 3:52 and they're closed. I was interested to se what kind of food they have but they don't have anything available right now. It's also very hard to find. It's inside of a pharmacy with no visible sign for The Green Regime."}
{"text":"First time experience-So, I'm sitting here sipping my Espresso Powerhouse AND taking bites of my Buffalo chicken salad....I'M IN LOVE!  The ladies were so kind and had no problems fulfilling my Paleo modification requests.  Their Paleo and clean options are welcoming to those looking for quick HEALTHY meal choices on the go!  Thanks ladies!"}
