{"text":"Coffee was good. Not crazy about the layout. Small cream and coffee center that you can hardly reach and the batista was in a bad mood. Probably will not be going back."}
{"text":"30 minutes for breakfast. Older, thin, dark brown/reddish haired waitress seemed to only be able handle one table at a time. She had blinders on the rest on her tables needs. Didn't look up to glance around at her other tables. Didn't refill coffee. We had to physically get up and track her down to ask for the check. Grease stain on the wall of our booth. Food was so so."}
{"text":"This cafe is very spacious, with a nice cozy fire place and great decor.  Everything I have tried there has been delicious.  I strongly recommend the Three Cheese Panini, and the Spicy Potato Soup (which I wish they would have regularly on the menu!).  You can't beat the prices, and I love that you can order breakfast all day every day."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Very clean, welcoming atmosphere. Everyone seems happy to be there. Amazing food. I ordered multiple plates of eggs, bacon, sausage and French toast.   Perk-Cup is a wonderful restaurant. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for both a hearty breakfast or a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I do like this place and would return again but, noticed a few unpleasant things during my visits.  One of the waitresses stood by the waitress station with her hands in her pocket, while the other waitresses were working.  Looked very unprofessional. Then I wanted to switch the meat that came with my food to fruit.  I didn't like the meat that came with the food. The waitress looked at me strange and said \"We don't do substitutions.  I guess I can just switch it out for you\" the place was nice but they need more people skills!"}
{"text":"Visited again a few weeks ago and it was just as enjoyable as our first visit.  I believe that Kim was our waitress this time.  She was very attentive and the food was excellent.  Our experiences have been all-around great."}
{"text":"We work at MetroPet Veterinary Clinic just down the road in Berea.  We eat at Perk Cup Cafe weekly, if not more often.  The food is consistently excellent.  Prices are very reasonable, and all of the servers are really nice.  We will continue to be regulars as long as Perk Cup is there.  You make our lunchtime relaxing and we love you!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a Sunday for their brunch.  I loved the variety of food offered, and the quality exceeded my expectations.  The staff was very accommodating (I had a baby in tow), offering to carry my diaper bag to table and holding the doors for me as I left.  The only thing keeping this from a 5, is the wait was longer than I would tolerate which is a result from a high demand for tables that they just don't have.  Hopefully, this is just a growing pain. Nonetheless, I will be back and recommend this to anyone entertaining the idea of trying out."}
{"text":"Nice diner for breakfast or lunch. Good prices and really good food. They have a drive through for take out that makes it super fast for work lunches. Service is OK, bit it depends on your server (like everywhere). Nice atmosphere and seating options.  EDIT:  They changed their menu and raised there prices, removing some of their signature dishes (or at least the ones that everyone that I know regularly ordered).  They got rid of all of my favorites, and raised the price of their breakfasts by more than $1, taking them from a good price to overpriced.  I still go there because the food is good and it's close to work, but it's not as automatic a choice as it once was."}
{"text":"The breakfast choices are fantastic and full of variety. They have a rewards system that actually is rewarding. The service there can sometime be a little inconsistent, but I keep coming back for the food. I'm glad I do, because each time I come the service gets better and better. Another thing I like is when you're near finishing your meal you can ask for a refill of you coffee to go, which they will gladly do at no extra charge."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here for breakfast frequently.  The food is good overall.  The eggs are always cooked well, pancakes and baked items are very good, and there is a decent variety of items.  The egg bakes are very good as well.  However, the service is horrible.  Waitresses are arguing in front of you, complaining about how busy they are, and it takes forever to get seated and get your food.  Also, it can sometimes be challenging to get a smile out of anyone.    It will take 45-1 hour from walking in the door to getting your food."}
{"text":"I've been here many times for breakfast. I will not go back. They don't sell newspapers. I ask for one every time I go there.... they don't get the hint. Also, I want real butter with my toast and they don't have it. And they act 'put out' when I ask for it. Tired of being treated like a villain when show I in interest in ingredients. Also servers have to many nose rings and tatoos to stimulate my appetite. Sorry but I'll go to a chain restaurant next time. At least I can expect bad, unhealthy food there."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! My friend and I went there for brunch. We got the breakfast bakers, which were pretty good. I also got a caramel frappe, which I loved (although, it took a while to make). It took quite some time to get seated because the hostess skipped over our name, but she apologized profusely. Our server, Elissa, was spectacular, but it took a long time to get refills on water. That was my only complaint."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and very well priced. I got two big pancakes, sausage patties, and eggs for about $6. It was a lot of food and it was excellent.  It tasted great and I'm excited to come back and try one of their specialty dishes. They definitely nailed the basics."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. The place looks new and clean. The staff were courteous and friendly. My omelette was delicious. The only downside is the wait time for the table and food."}
{"text":"Could not have been any better!!   Terry preparing the omelette and waffles literally tripped over himself to help us and explain the Sunday brunch etc.  Recently moved to Berea and this was our second visit.  Both visit everyone was very polite and helpful.  This is on our list of new hangouts.  Waitress (Kim) very efficient and kind as well.  Very welcoming place.  Definitely being added to our list of new hangouts.  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere, but make sure allow for a long meal. They screwed up our name on the wait list, wait time was not what we were told, excessive wait time to place order, had to ask for ordered drinks 2 times, excessive wait time for food (25 mins), then it took another 20-25 mins to pay the bill.  Breakfast was good, but not worth all the screw ups and no apologies!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in the area.  We have been coming here since 2011, we bring friends and visitors.  First, it's a nice location with lots of parking, in a new plaza next to the train tracks. The restaurant is large, very clean and includes a fireplace with chairs, as well as an outdoor patio.  I recently stopped in to have a baker for breakfast. It's a baked breakfast dish, straight out of the oven in a ceramic pot to your table. Eggs, potatoes, and a variety of meats, vegetables and then topped with cheese. I had the VegetaBle baker and it was delicious. It came with rye toast, which was buttered.  My wife had pancakes with blackberry brandy. She asked for the side order version as the normal portions are rather large. The side portion included two large pancakes with a warm blackberry sauce that looked and tasted homemade.  All costs are very reasonable, my dish was 6.99 my wife's was less than that.  As a final perk, when leaving they asked if we wanted another coffee to go. Who has ever done that before?"}
{"text":"Their drink menu is great. It's clean and well decorated. Their buffet on the weekend is very good. The service is generally very slow for the number of tables they have at a time. Overall a very average dining establishment. I wish they had more vegan options."}
{"text":"This review will most likely echo the thoughts of the other reviews for this place. Overall, good food, lousy service.  Saturday mornings are always busy at diners and brunch places, but Perk-Cup felt empty of staff to clear tables and seat patrons. This was an overall theme to the dining experience which was filled with long waits for food, and to pick up the check (i was given my check mid meal...and am still waiting currently to be cashed out...almost 7 minutes now). The Garden Vegetable Baker was a good size portion of eggs, veggies, cheese, and hash brown with a side of toast.  If you're work on your patience, please visit. I certainly had plenty of time to practice my mindfulness of waiting, as well as check emails and social media. Speed up the service and this place will be great."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but every time I go there it gets worse and worse with every visit.  Recently I went to get breakfast after church and after a 15 minute wait for a table which was expected I noticed other tables were crossed off their \"wait list\" that came in after us.  I get it that they would like to sit 4 people at a 4 person table but I really do not want to wait until one of their little 2 person tables opens up so we can be jammed into it.  Once again, I get it... I do not expect to be put at a 6 or 8 person table because that would be weird for 2 people.  After being seated we waited 5-10 minutes for a waitress to stop and take our drink order which she brought promptly back but would return to take our breakfast order.  Fast forward 25-30 minutes (I eventually put a timer on my phone as I was getting aggravated) another waitress stopped by and told us that there must have been a mix up.  We ordered 4 over easy eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and toast.  Fast forward a second time for another 30 minutes; we have not been checked on, I ran out of coffee, and the table seated at the same time we were had received their food, ate, and were signing their bill.  After the strenuous feat of flagging down the waitress that took our order but was not her table, we asked for a bill for the coffee and told her we were leaving because we had a prior obligation we needed to attend.  She seamed very put off that after spending over an hour to attempt to order 4 eggs (only half cooked so it should have been easier), a couple strips of bacon, hashbrowns, and toast; she told us \"its fine, don't worry about the coffee bill\".  And no apology offered.  But seriously...  This is average breakfast food.  4 eggs, a couple strips of bacon, hashbrowns, and toast???  Why didn't that just take it off of the buffet?  We could see giant piles of this in their roasters.  But then again it would have been $15 per person if it came from the buffet.  This is the first time we have ever walked out of a restaurant without eating."}
{"text":"Stoped in on a Wednesday morning around 9:00, after a visit to my doctor's office.  Noticed all the cars in the parking lot and knew there wasn't an outbreak of malaria nearby, so I assumed they were here for some other reason.  Glad I came in.  The service was a bit slow getting seated and then getting my order placed, but to reiterate, just a BIT slow.  The place was pretty crowded and the lag in service wasn't due to people not caring.  I wanted something light and simple, so I asked for 2 eggs over medium, ham steak, coffee and water.  The food came right out (brought by a different person than the one that took my order- good teamwork!) and was exactly what I expected.  There is also a nice 'lounge' area with a couple of leather chairs on either side of a fireplace.  Nice alternative to a Starbucks. Would not hesitate to come back again.  After I paid, waitress asked if I wanted a cup of coffee to go. 4 stars just went to 5!"}
{"text":"This place is one of those little neighborhood spots in a very unassuming strip mall tucked back off of Bagley Rd.  Nothing to get too excited about here, just average breakfast and lunch fare that you can get anywhere.  Had the Chicken BLT Wrap and Kettle Chips.  Mom had the Eggplant Parmesan Sandwich and Kettle Chips.  The sandwich was served on some generic hamburger bun, instead of something like Ciabatta Bread.  This is not a place I would actually say lets drive out there, but a place you stop because your hungry, just passing by, and it's convenient."}
{"text":"A bit of a \"hidden gem\" in a nondescript strip mall in Berea, just on the other side of the viaduct.  This place has a nice assortment of both breakfast and lunch dishes...I have had both and can attest to the quality and freshness of the food served.  My favorite menu item there is there club sandwich with fresh turkey, bacon and all the fixings.  Also, don't forget to try their \"loaded\" potato salad...a unique take on a traditional side dish.  Have also been there late-night for coffee and dessert.  They have a nice double-sided fireplace with comfy lounge chairs to hang out, etc.  Will definitely return once I move my office back to Olmsted Falls."}
{"text":"Solid coffee shop.  Reasonable prices.  Friendly staff.  Daily specials.  Plenty of seating and free wi-fi.  I actually think this place would be more popular if it were smaller (it sounds strange to say that), because it feels a little bit too open to me.  Kind of a mix between a Panera and a Starbucks.  Absolutely worth a visit.    When I was there, they brought around samples of some delicious gluten-free cookies.  What a bonus!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, this is so much more than a coffee house! This gem is a fantastic restaurant,  that also has a coffee house section. The menu is diverse, with breakfast, sandwiches, wraps, through dinner entrées including a braised short rib dinner. Again, not coffee house selections by any stretch of the imagination.  There were 4 of us dining this evening, and we all had something different, so we got a nice cross section of samples. All of the food was excellent! I had the bbq ribs with the Dr. Pepper  bbq sauce, and they were great.  Tasty, and fall of the bone tender. My wife had chicken parm, which was juicy and very flavorful. My friend had the Pork chop dinner, with an apricot chutney served with risotto. The chop was juicy, and the risotto was perfect, which is rare for most restaurants.  The side dishes were perfect, i had green beans almondine, and they were prepared perfect. Not just green beans with almonds on them, but actually prepared like a fine dining restaurant would with toasted almonds and sautéed beans. I was impressed. This was my first visit, but our friends have been there several times and have raved about the food each time. The atmosphere is simple and un-assuming, very casual, and family friendly.  Because of the high quality of the food, I consider this place an excellent value. (Braised short rib dinner for under  $18!)  Everything is homemade, and fresh, and you can really taste the difference. Oh, the deserts were equally as good! Did I  mention that they serve coffee there also..........  Food Giants rating system;  5* = Freakin' Great. 4* = Really Darn Good.  3* = sure, why not, 2*= it's better than starving, 1* = A hungry homeless person, after one bite,  wouldn't eat this, even if you gave it to them for free. (Although you should still offer it to them) No Stars = Ptomaine Tillie's foodborne pathogen Diner. (Yes the P is silent in Ptomaine)  Food Quality: ***** Portion Size:  ***** Service:          *** Menu:             **** Uniqueness:   *** Atmosphere:  *** Cleanliness:   ***** Value:             ******  Its great to be able to patronize an independent small business, that offers great food at a good value. Please support these types of businesses."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced, management is super unfriendly, not happy about the food either. If you are in Berea you're better off going literally anywhere else. Takes forever to get recognized when you walk in and when you sit down you're not even greeted for another 15 minutes, and as a waitress myself, that makes me cringe. Would not send friends this way. Only to maybe grab a cup of coffee through the drive through so you don't have to go inside and actually receive the bad service."}
{"text":"I went here today to take a couple work clients out to lunch. I'm from Dublin Ohio but these clients are from the area and picked the location.  The building itself looks brand new inside and out. The place is very clean and big. I noticed that they have a party room also.  They serve all day breakfast and have wonderful smelling coffee!   I had the short rib sandwich, the guys had a fish sandwich and quesadilla. Everything looked fresh. My sandwich was outstanding! The meat was juicy and very tender. The sauce was also very good.  I would go back here in a heart beat. My Cleveland office is about a mile away from it and rest assure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times, mostly because it's like five minutes away.  The food is pretty much average, though I do like the Farmer's Market English muffin sandwich.  After today, we will probably not be going back.  Though it really wasn't that busy, it took just over half an hour to get served.  Dishes were coming out of the kitchen about eight minutes apart, and when ours was finally brought out, we asked the waitress if there was only one cook in the kitchen, and she said, no, there were two, but one of them was new.  Poor planning on their part means we were sitting there hungry for way too long.  It is very clean and bright, but very wide open and not very cozy.  The food is passable, so if you don't mind mediocre food and slow service, this is the place for you.  Also, they only offer a limited menu on Sunday mornings, since they have the breakfast buffet then, so we haven't gone back there on a Sunday since we found that out........and now we won't be going back there at all."}
{"text":"1st off, I do like this joint.  Sunday brunch in my area is non-existent so I came for the buffet.  Waitress was not around to greet me so I took off to get my breakfast, because she didn't greet me I didn't get to find out that becasue of my age I could have gotten my meal for $10.99 instead of $12.99, I'm older than 55.  I should have forgotten to leave her a gratuity. Sausage, bacon, hash brown bake were good, biscut-gravy and scrambled eggs  not so much.  Over by the omlette station they have waffels, those were a great way to end the meal.  Next time I'll have the chef make me an omlette. If you can eat both breakfast and lunch at the same time, they offer ribs and mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I like this place. It has a nice atmosphere, good coffee and great breakfast I haven't been in for lunch yet, but plan on it soon.   I have had breakfast there 3 time so far each time it was really good! Food was always hot and had good flavor. The only bad thing I could say is that the service was a bite on the slow side, but they busy each time I was in there.   It is nice to see a locally owned small business doing things the right way."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a local cozy place to grab some breakfast or coffee this is a great choice. I love the fireplace and kids books available. I go here often with my young kids and a friend. The service is a little slow so I have to keep that in mind when we go there. My kids love all of the breakfast options and I enjoy the warm drinks and variety of food. Be sure to ask your server about the daily specials and find out what bakery item is recommended."}
{"text":"Waitresses bus tables and do not wash hands. Love the food but saw this way too many times."}
{"text":"Tucked away behind a bridge in an awkward business plaza or something sits this cute little cafe. Came in on a Sunday where they apparently have a limited menu and a $12 brunch buffet.  We decided to go with the buffet and walked away feeling money well spent. The food quality in this clean establishment was above part and we'll prepared. Standing behind the active station was a friendly older gentleman preparing your perfectly put together omelet. Tip the man please because he deserves it and seems like he couldn't be happier to put together your omelet.  For the waffles they offer homemade peach and blackberry compote to dress over your waffle. Can't speak for the peach, but the blackberry was delicious. Tasted fresh and not too sweet.  Happy we found this place, and hope you will too."}
{"text":"Our family favorite ...Sunday breakfast buffet is amazing! So much great, hot food. The selection is too much. Lol . Made to order omelettes are perfect! Customer service is outstanding!  Kim our server is the best! She is very attentive and caring."}
{"text":"Same story as last visit. This is more of a cafe than a restaurant at dinner time... pretty empty, lacking specials/promos, and servers are not perky.  My silverware were both dirty, and the tables are kinda small.. barely fit our plates, glasses, condiments.  Food is tasty though. Wrap w/ chips a bit small for $.  Oh just remembered they gave me wrong wrap and salad dressing too.  Seems that they're just going through the motions. :("}
{"text":"This is an interesting little place. Great coffee, fabulous food, and friendly staff. Very unassuming. It's like a breakfast nook and a coffee house had a baby that was perkcup.  Cozy fire in the winter makes for a nice atmosphere.  Dee is my favorite waitress. Please make / sell more jazzy Java. Order the 'sweet and savory' and drown it in syrup.   Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"We have been going to the cafe since it opened,  The food is great, the waitresses are very and know the menu.  I love the homemade soups !!"}
{"text":"We went today for Father's Day brunch and had reservations. I have a 2 year old and requested a high hair. Well we got there and had to wait over 10 min and then they didn't have a high chair for my daughter. I think they only have 2 in the whole place. We literally  stood there for a good 5 min waiting before we finally sat down and our waitress finally came over and asked if we needed anything and I said yes we need a highchair and they were still supposedly looking for one. She brought over another chair and I looked at her and I said my daughter is 2 that is not going to work. She did apologize but offered us no other alternative. We were finally offered coffee and some beverages a good 10 minutes after we got there. Our service overall was subpar. My daughter had to sit on my husband's lap or my lap because we never did get a highchair!!!! After over an hour I did see that I highchair finally became available and they never even offered to see if we needed it at that point! It overall seem like they were overstaffed and completely unprepared for the amount of people although I know that they've had Father's Day and Mother's Day brunch is before so it's not like they didn't know that this amount of people were going to be there! The food was okay I'm just really upset by the customer service."}
{"text":"So ...anxious to try this place as I love a good breakfast spot. Service at first was prompt, we were seared right away 9:30 on a Saturday morning the place was almost full. I ordered eggs Benedict , and biscuits and gravy. My wife got bourbon peach French toast. First off ( in my best Donald Trump voice) the portions were YUGE!!. Sadly the eggs Benedict was a flavorless mess. It was not played well, just kind of slopped all over the plate with a watery absolutely flavorless yellow something I would not even recognize as hollandaise sauce on top. The biscuit gravy was delicious but when brought out had that not so nice under the  heat lamp  too long crust on it. Had our server ever come back around to say, refill our coffee, or ask about our food I would have returned it. The biscuits were obviously store bought mush. My wife's only response was meh. Obviously canned peaches and just okay. One and done."}
{"text":"A really nice breakfast place that's out of the way. It's perfect for a breakfast date with your significant other. The service was fast. Definitely get there by 9am on Sunday, because it gets pretty busy. I definitely recommend going there whether it's for brunch with your girlfriends, your family or with your significant other."}
{"text":"Went here after a run in the park. Great breakfast and great services. I was also impressed by the proportions for the price. Will be back for the baked breakfast bowls!!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting the area and decided to try a local restaurant. We went on a Sunday around noon and stumbled upon their Sunday brunch buffet. The omelet station is well stocked with a good variety of meats and vegetables. The gentleman cooking them is very personable. The Belgian waffles came with a choice of blueberry or apple cinnamon toppings, and both were delicious. They also offered various breakfast meats and sides as well.  The coffee bar portion of the establishment made a great addition to the meal. The only negative in any way comes from the service. While very friendly, it was an extremely relaxed atmosphere of \"We'll get to you when we want.\"  In spite of the service issue, my wife and I will definitely be back whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"Average food, lousy service.  The hostess was very monotone. She sat on her shift and stood up to greet me with no personality . I requested a specific table by the front door but was told that was the \"owners\" table. Odd they need their own specific table and would take away from paying customers, but hey it's not my establishment. Hostess sat me at the next table over.   The server was nice, but slow. I felt like I waited forever to get things. The food was average. Not bad, but not spectacular either.   When it came time to pay my server disappeared completely. I couldn't find her and needed to get back to work. After 10 minutes went by with my credit card just sitting on the table I flagged down another server. Asked her if she could cash me out. Of course she couldn't, but would find my server. Waited another 2 minutes are so to be cashed out."}
{"text":"Perk Cup Cafe recently opened its doors (about 3 months now) in a tucked away newly opened strip of shops in Berea, OH.   Their offering is primarily the breakfast, brunch, & lunch crowd.  The interior is very well planned out, spacious, complete with rearrangable tables as well as a fireplace with a nook for more cozy seating.    Check out the pictures I uploaded. They even boast a drive-through, which does not yet seem to be open.  Although touting to be a breakfast stop, Perk Cup Cafe by no means is a grab-and-go place.  The service is relatively slow, although not impolite.  The slowness is clearly evident from the ordering process through the table service.  So my conclusion of Perk Cup is to either go for a sit-down breakfast, brunch or lunch time.  Due to its recent opening, lunch time is not very busy during the weekdays.  Food menu at Perk Cup, offers breakfast sandwiches, other standard breakfast items like Granola, Yoghurt.  the coffee selection are the standard 4 or 5 flavors for a breakfast stop.  For lunch crowd the items choices include Salads to light standard cold or panini sandwiches.  The food items and quality are nothing to 'write home about', they are the standard tasting.  Perk Cup does not seem to offer any niche or specialty items when it comes to food.   If you are located in or visiting Berea,  and need a spacious and un-crowded place for a breakfast or lunch meeting, Perk Cup might just be a good consideration."}
{"text":"Just went by here with my husband on our way home. We were expecting a coffee shop, but it feels more like a diner. The food that we've had so far is great! (Eggs benedict and the caprice flat bread) The iced vanilla latte is also pretty good.   It definitely does not have the atmosphere of a cafe, but this is likely because it is so large! Might need to come back when it is a little busier to see how it is then."}
{"text":"The food has always been priced reasonable and taste fantastic. Dinner prices could be a little more expensive but the quality makes it worthwhile."}
{"text":"Perk-Cup is definitely a convenient spot to drop by if you want something different or healthy without getting out of your car. However, I didn't have the best experience. I ordered my food in advance and arrived when they told me my food would be ready. When I first arrived at the drive up, I was food was still being prepared- that's fine; I didn't mind waiting a few minutes. I ended up waiting 10+ minutes at the window. Because or the issue, I was given a free cookie.   All of this to say, the food isn't bad but I wouldn't bet on your food being ready when you get there!"}
{"text":"No vegetarian soup selection?  Water was awful...unfiltered Berea water.  Undrinkable.  Hot chocolate served in a cheapie styrofoam cup worthy of McDonalds.  Quesidillas was good, but need a soup or something...oh, no vegetarian soups. Popular place...service a bit slow. Baker was served on a plate way to small...tasted good.  Meh, I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Looking for an affordable breakfast in Berea that doesn't disappoint on taste? This is your place. We go here often with my dad and step mom and they love it too. Not only is the food a hit, but the service is good too. I I love you how they feature area artists' work on their walls, too. I would have given five stars, but I'm not a huge fan of how the dining area is situated. It's a little crammed in my opinion."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick soy latte and a caramel brownie w graham cracker crust. Place was packed (Saturday around 11:20am).  Soy latte was solid and the brownie was delicious (which it shoulda been for $6) Will be back when we visit again"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I never really know what to make of Perk-Cup Cafe. Is it a restaurant (the place is packed on Saturdays and Sundays for brunch, and they offer full menus for breakfast, lunch, and dinner), a bakery (the windows case is packed with cakes, cookies, and other bakery delights), or a cafe (a variety of coffee drinks are available)?   The thing is, I guess that's where Perk-Cup falls a little short for me; it seems to have a bit of an identity crisis. In fairness, I have only been there (albeit on a number of different occasions) for breakfast on a Saturday or Sunday, and I have never opted for the brunch buffet, electing rather to order off their menu.   The food is always really good. Fresh eggs, fresh ingredients, and some of the best pancakes you've had in a very long time unless you're making them yourself; yes they're that good.   The service is ok. They're generally nice enough but there also seems to be a systemic problem somewhere behind the scenes, as it always feels as though you are on the cusp of utter chaos, like they're just barely hanging on. It's just a bit disorganized and it makes one feel a bit uneasy.   On the coffee side of the house, let's just say you've had better coffee at a lesser place I'm sure. I'd either take the \"Cafe\" out of the name, or find a new coffee vendor and/or barista. It's not horrible mind you, but it's not anything to write home about either.   The bakery case is always full of sweet treats, although I question their freshness. I've never actually eaten any of there bakery items, and they all look really good, but I wonder how long a quarter of a cake could have been sitting there when I come in on a Saturday or Sunday morning. How quickly could they have sold 3/4 of a cake by 9 am? See what I mean? But again, in fairness, I've never actually tried anything from their bakery so I may be way off.   Like I said, I've been to Perk-Cup a number of times for breakfast, and I will go a number more times. I've always enjoyed my breakfast there. But with a couple of tweeks, I bet this place could really be something!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Service was very sloooow, and place was empty with ample employees.   I saw other similar reviews, hopefully ownership can solve this."}
{"text":"The home town go to for breakfast, great food and great prices.  The servers are friendly and it feels like home.  Try the waffles and blackberry Bourbon sauce."}
{"text":"Good food and very spotty service. We often hit them up on weekends after soccer or other stuff since they're so close to home, have good food, and nice coffee drinks.   If they weren't so close we'd probably hardly show up because of the service. But they're close enough and the food is consistently good.  Burgers are really good but they will charge you for simple toppings like red onion (???!!) and everything on the breakfast side is yummy. Tasty coffee drinks too."}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon this place by chance. Wow! What a gem. very nice feel to the place. Very open and clean. Good quality food. I had a piece of home made pecan pie and it was excellent along with good coffee. Menu looked really good but didn't stay to eat more."}
{"text":"Still haven't eaten the food here but I wanted to give their mocha another try since I didn't want Starbucks or Dunkin.  I got a iced caffe mocha & it was really good this time! It was also even cheaper than the last time. I guess the prices depends on who's doing the coffee.   This place has been redeemed, totally coming back here again to get my coffee fix."}
{"text":"Very good!  I'm only giving it 3 stars because I've only been there twice, for breakfast. I'm not sure how other items on the menu are, but if they're anything like breakfast, they're going to taste great! Very clean, especially the bathrooms, which is important to me in a restaurant. The overall look of the place is cozy and inviting. They stay pretty steady on weekends from what I've seen. I love that this place is pretty close to home, yummy food, reasonable priced and great wait staff."}
{"text":"Really nice out of the way place with a great breakfast menu with fresh ingredients and a coffee bar.  You might think it is coffee only but good food as well."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch, everyone ordered the buffet. They had an omelet station, pierogies, chicken paprikash and all the regular stuff.   Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Coffee was good.   We will come back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Not a ton of options on the menu, and I've only eaten breakfast here. Their coffee is amazing, and the hash brown are extra crispy-which I love!"}
{"text":"Have been a patron at this restaurant since it opened, and recently have become unimpressed with the current establishment. Don't get me wrong- the food is great and one of the best breakfast/brunch/lunch spots in Berea. Have never had a bad meal here and probably never will. However, the service has deteriorated over the years. When it first opened, my mother and I used to go there for breakfast on the weekend and could get in and out in 45 minutes. Now, we're lucky if we get in and out in a hour and half to two hours. Our drink orders always come right away but we end up waiting at least a half hour for our food. In fact, attempted to eat lunch there today and today's experience took the cake for bad service. There was a party going on in the back room, but our waitress did not notify us of this fact until she came back 35 minutes after we ordered to apologize for slow service because of the party. We then asked her how much longer it would be and when she told us we would STILL have to wait another 10 to 15 minutes, we left. A party should not slow service down to that extreme, and if it does the owners should reevaluate how the kitchen runs because obviously something is amiss. Even the half hour wait on a slow day is an indicator that something needs to be done to improve efficiency.  Disregarding service, the food my mother and I have eaten here over the years has always been great. For breakfast, I usually get \"The Berea\" with scrambled eggs, bacon, and a biscuit and she either orders that or pancakes. Their \"Turkey, Bacon, Cheddar\" wrap is also an excellent option for lunch. I really do love the food here and that's why I was very upset when my mother and I had but no choice to leave without food today because the service was so poor. Overall, if you order take-out you do not wait nearly as long for the food, so if in the area and you want to experience the fantastic breakfast offered by Perk-cUp, I suggest ordering it to-go to save yourself the service headache. Food is deserving of all 5 stars, but their service is only deserving of 1. Great eats, but make sure to get it to-go."}
{"text":"Nice lunch spot, clean and spacious, and I always like a place with a cozy fireplace.  Had a decent but not huge selection on their lunch menu, including sandwiches, wraps, salads, as well as the daily lunch specials, which included a soup of the day, quesadilla of the day, and two quiches.  Also a number of specialty coffees.  You place your order at the counter, and the meal is brought out to your table. Overall, a very satisfactory place for a workday lunch.  I wasn't there for breakfast, but the breakfast menu looked good, with choices listed including waffles, omelets, hot oatmeal, and eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Over weight locals and their fat kids flock to the Sunday brunch.  But unless you like gorging on all you can eat bacon and sausage patties while sitting in a dance hall I'd just hit a Bob Evans.  Oh, the coffee was extra at the brunch.   Just an overpriced Golden Coral Sunday Brunch.  I don't know what's on their menu cause they never gave us a menu.  I was happy to see others going up for a third plateful, since I never got close to shoving $12.99 worth of bacon into my mouth, at least someone was getting my money's worth."}
{"text":"Glad to find a local restaurant for breakfast that is not a chain. I had read the reviews and was looking forward to standard American fare, eggs, hashbrowns, bacon.  The food was average. Hashbrowns had a little too much oil, toast was not done enough. Eggs were good, bacon was cooked properly but the flavor was not my favorite.  Normally with breakfast like that, coffee or tea is included. Not here. $1.89. Plus my first cup of hot water was not even warm enough to brew the tea. Our server didn't look like she was too thrilled to bring me some more hot water. Plus, I had to reuse the teabag I had tried the first time which is probably what made the tea so devoid of flavor."}
{"text":"They have brunch!! Next time we'll plan better!  We just came in for a mid-morning snack & tea/coffee - the Sunday brunch looks fabulous, with omelet bar all for $12.99! $5.99 for kids!"}
{"text":"Nice place that has definitley improved over the years.French toast with bourbon peaches is SO good. They now serve dinner."}
{"text":"Our first time here.  Had to wait about 10 minutes. Sat at a table and told us our server would be there soon . We waited another 10-15 minutes before I asked for a server. The person I asked did take our order and was going to bring us water and coffee, another 12 min goes by and I ask another server for coffee and water.  She brought it one minute. Our server brought my hubbies food another 15 min. Eggs undercooked and French toast without syrup and Never brought him his toast. Over charged us for the meal, which she did correct.  First and last time there.  If you are with a bigger party you get service. A party if 5 who were seated after us,received their food before we did! I do not recommend their buffet.  One day we my try another day.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for brunch. Each time I'm a bit amazed at how good the food really is for a small town place tucked in near the train tracks.  I went a la carte on my last visit and ordered a pancake, sausage patties, hash browns, and a side of fruit. I figured they would all be super small side portions, but boy was I wrong. They were very generous with the plating and I couldn't finish all of my food.   The pancake was delicious and looked so tempting that my friend had to sneak a taste too and agreed. It was a fluffy disc the size of a large plate with a dollop of whipped butter on the top. It's probably a dish you can recall from memory of a past experience, but this pancake still exceeded my expectations. The maple syrup mixed in with the melted butter to create a wonderful balance of decadent sweetness.  If you're looking to order a dish straight off the menu, I would recommend the Spanish Omelette. Cheesy eggs and meat together with a little bit of spice. What's not to love? A note to spice wimps that the dish is not too hot on the scale.   Let there be a warning that service is fairly slow here. If you're someone that often needs a refill of coffee or water, this probably isn't the place for you.   Most servers are friendly at least, but one of the women that runs food orders is not only not helpful, but is rude and dismissive. I tried to politely ask about the side of fruit that I ordered and was missing from the table, and she rudely said the other woman would bring it and walked away. My server then came out, but there was still no side of fruit. I had to kindly ask again for my order. My server quickly fixed this issue, but the other woman had the first opportunity to correct the order and dismissed me.   All in all, I deducted a star for service, but it's a place I'd go to again if I was in the area. At least I know that I'll get a pretty good meal if nothing else."}
{"text":"So much more than a coffee cafe. Super friendly staff, nice atmosphere,  and great food at a great price.  Everything we've ever tried has been delicious!  They use top quality ingredients and it shows. Open,  clean,  and inviting with a fireplace."}
{"text":"This is a great casual place to grab food. While it's not fine dining, it's perfect for what it is.  Atmosphere: bright and open are the best two words to describe this spot. It's nice because the tables aren't clustered together, and the combination of lights and windows give plenty of light.  Service: servers are friendly. Mom and pop diner feel for sure.   Food: I've tried several dishes here; gf quesadillas, salads, but mostly breakfast. Everything was always good. I can't say I've fantasized about the food here after I've eaten, but I've never had any complaints either.  Overall a good diner spot."}
{"text":"I must say that this place is the first restaurant recommended to us by a voice synthesized computer (we asked 'Siri', the artificial intelligence voice resident on our iPhone 5, to recommend some breakfast places {they serve lunch/dinner too}, and one of the places 'she' mentioned was Perk-Cup Cafe)!  We definitely 'owe her one'!  We were looking for a new place to try for breakfast, and let me tell you, this excellent cafe/restaurant does NOT dissapoint!   Breakfast (which is served all day) choices are plentiful, and my wife was thrilled with her delicious 'Miss Vicki' breakfast bake, which is a combination of layered sun dried tomato pesto, provolone, italian sausage, hash browns, and scrambled eggs.  I had a cheddar cheese omelet with red onions (with rye toast), and a pancake side.  Both were scrumptious!  The interior is very nice and modern, with a huge 'open air' layout that looks like a combination diner / hip cafe, complete with fireplace, armchairs lounge area, high chairs and a long bar table lining the windows, and conventional dining tables and booths.  And a pastry counter to test your will-power on the way in or out!  VERY nice!  On a side note, the restrooms are immaculate clean, and they even have a drive-thru pickup window too, as well as free Wi-Fi!  The staff is very professional and friendly too.  My only regret is that we didn't discover this gem sooner!  Needless to say, HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"Well I was really in the mood to try a new breakfast place and this one had some good reviews.  The service was good and the waitress we had was very friendly. As for the menu, it was pretty basic next to the restaurants we've been going to lately. Sometimes that's exactly what you need. I had the sweet and savory platter with scrambled eggs, sausage, and plain buttermilk pancakes. Very good and satisfied my breakfast craving. I did find the fact that they have breakfast sandwiches pretty unique and even though I didn't get one personally, I heard the Jo Jo was delightful.   Now for the stuff I didn't care for... There was a guy doing construction work near the bathroom the whole time we were there. So instead of a music ambiance, we had power tools. Why they scheduled that during business hours is beyond me and if I hadn't had a six person party coming from all different directions to get together, I would have left. It's really distracting trying to talk to people when that's going on. Also the tea I had wasn't very good. I realize it's not their fault when all they have is bagged tea but I do appreciate a larger selection if that's what you're going to serve.  The food and service was ok, nothing to write home about but definitely good for the plain breakfast mood when you're sick of Bob Evans. Honestly, there could have been a very good reason for the construction work even though they didn't bother to explain. It could have been an off day and I wouldn't mind giving this place a second chance in the future."}
{"text":"Giving them 5 stars - Food is fine.. no complaints. I have found service at Perk Cup is best when served by Kim M. or Stacey. These two will make your dining experience very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Let me say that the food here is really good but the service is slow and at times chaotic. Do not go if you are in a hurry. Servers run around like chickens with their heads cut off. They have no order or process for what they do which is a shame because the food is worth it. I like that you can create your own egg bake. I have gotten different combos and it's nice to be able to have it the way you want it.  I'm not a coffee drinker but i am told tje coffee is really good."}
{"text":"Second time here and 1st trying the Sunday brunch buffet. We arrived around noon and it was busy, but there appeared to be many open tables so we put our name in thinking it would go fast. About 1/2 later and 25 or so \"I'm hungry's\" from the kids, our name was called. We told the lady who sat us that we wanted the buffet and she mumbled someone would be with us soon to get our order. Finally after about 5 minutes I sent my wife and kids up to get food and waited to \"place our order\" for buffets. The waitress came by and was sweet as pie and took our drink order and explained what was on the buffet. Looking around, she was the ONLY waitress who had a smile on her face and looked like she wanted to be alive that day. Onto the food... they have a great spread including made-to-order omelets, fresh waffles, bacon, sausage, french toast, potatoes, biscuits and sausage gravy, fruit, muffins and dessert. The older gentleman who was making the eggs and waffles was amazing and put on a show for my daughter who wanted to go back up for seconds on her omelet. The eggs were fluffy and he didn't skimp on the ingredients. The waffles were to die for and the gravy for the biscuits was very tasty. I didn't care much for the potatoes or bacon/sausage but overall it was a very good meal for $14.95 per person  ($6.99 for kids) but the service was just ok. Like I said, we had a great waitress and the omelet guy was friendly, but the greeters, the ladies serving coffee at the front desk and the rest of the wait staff didn't seem to want any part of customers. We may try this again because I love a good, tasty breakfast buffet, but with other options it won't be our go-to place. Yet."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for meetings especially if you need to meet somewhere near the airport. I love the entire beverage menu worth chai tea lattes being my personal favorite. I also really like he biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"We came here because this is the only breakfast place within 10 minutes of the airport, where our friend was staying. I was expecting an empty place, but surprisingly, a lot of people there on a Sunday morning at 9:45am.   Food wise, it is your standard breakfast fare. Lunch was also served in the early morning as well. My bf got the chicken salad - had a bite, our clinic cafeteria made better chicken salad sandwiches with more flavor. It came with a side of chips. Nothing special, not worth paying $8 for it. I ordered the Sweet and Savory platter. Three small slices of bacon - on the plus side, they were not very greasy. Two eggs over easy - eggs were well done, but they are just eggs... Didn't appreciate the french toast and the eggs on the same plate, since it just made the egg yolk run over to the french toast, ketchup mixed with maple syrup, etc. Had the extra blackberry brandy sauce on the side for the french toast. I think the maple syrup tasted better. The sauce was on the sour side, not what I was expecting...   Service... now this is where they get bumped from 3 stars down to 2. The whole place was full, so it was fine waiting 10-15 minutes for a table. However, when we got down to ordering, we ended up waiting almost 30 min for our food. This is very very simple and standard food. I cannot comprehend how 2 dishes of 2 eggs, bacon, french toast, and a chicken salad wrap could have taken that long... even if there was a whole dining room full. Should still have not taken that long. We did not get checked on once during our meal, except for like 1 minute after we got the food, before we even started eating, the waitress came by to ask us how we liked the food. After that, it took us 10 minutes to get a waitress to bring us our checks, and then another 10 minutes for them to bring the credit cards back. Overall, what should have been a 1 hour long breakfast got extended out to 2 hours. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Stop in here today and wished I lived closer,  such a wonderful place.  Great coffee and delicious food."}
{"text":"Good food but took an hour and half just to get seated and eat breakfast. Service was slow and they were understaffed."}
{"text":"The Brunch on Sunday is excellent! The staff is very friendly and helpful. I especially enjoyed the thick bacon!! It was real bacon. The omelette station had a good variety of toppings too. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food was OK. Definitely reasonable, cheap prices and large portions. I ordered an omelette and a pancake which were both decent. Unfortunately, the service was not so good. I was greeted by someone who was hesitant to seat me. She informed me that their credit card machine was broken so I had to pay in cash.. No big deal. My server Jen was terrible though. She looked miserable and was sitting down at a table most of the time. She dropped my water off and didn't come back to take my food order. I waited for almost 10 minutes before waving down another server to take my order. Instead of that server coming over, she yelled to someone else \"isn't that Jen's table?\" And I had to wait until they could get Jen to come back to my table. After I completed my meal, I asked Jen for my check to which she replied \"I don't know what I can do about that, our computers are down so I don't know how to get you your check.\" I waited for over 30 minutes and still had yet to receive my check. Jen hadn't come back to my table since to keep my updated. She has horrible service, horrible personality and a terrible attitude.   Don't waste your time here. You can get a better breakfast experience at almost any other breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with the husband and we both loved our meals! I had eggs Benedict  (added spinach) and he had the Sweet and Savory. Holandaise was delicious, bacon was perfect. The server was sweet and attentive and the place is very cute, even has a two sided fireplace to have a drink and a snack by."}
{"text":"Stopped for our first time visit to cafe. We went for breakfast and liked that it was a really bright and clean cafe.  The prices were reasonable for breakfast.  $5.99 sausage gravy and biscuits. $1.29 for two eggs added on.  $7.98 for 2 pancakes, 3 strips of bacon and 2 eggs. Husband's sausage gravy tasted homemade with lots of sausage chunks.  Bacon was crispy as requested.  Only food complaint was the pancakes.  They were so tough that it was hard to cut them.  When I brought it to the servers attention, she told me that was how they make them, that their pancakes are dense, not fluffy.  When I said that I could barely cut them, she offered to have them make another batch and they could try cooking them less time.  The replacements were a little better but still pretty tough. (Note to cafe:  maybe the pancake batter needs refreshed with baking powder or stirred less?  This should result in a better pancake.)  I opted for the blackberry topping over the Mrs. Butterworth's syrup.  Great choice, topping had lots of blackberries.  Now for my Tea Rant:  Hot tea drinkers will get this.  Two things ruin a hot tea experience.  First is contaminated water.  Water is contaminated when they use containers that previously held coffee, resulting in coffee tasting tea. Perk-cUp Cafe does NOT have contaminated tea water, but they hit on my other hot tea nerve.  The second is tea refills.  We were charged the same price for both coffee and tea, $1.89 each.  Husband got his hot coffee and even a refill pot was placed on the table for his convenience.  I got a tea bag and carafe of hot water.  When server offered a refill, she wanted to charge me another $1.89 for a second tea bag. What? Husband gets a whole pot of coffee on the table? Coffee is way more expensive than tea.  Anyway, she did give me a 2nd tea bag, this time, only because I had a problem with the pancakes.  (another note to cafe:  Rethink the policy of charging for a 2nd tea bag.  Do you charge for refills on pop or iced tea?)  End Rant. I like supporting locally owned restaurants and will most likely return for lunch sometime.  The menu offered many different sandwiches, salads, and soups.  If I went for breakfast though, I would skip the pancakes."}
{"text":"On July 10, 2015, my family and I were looking for a new place to eat breakfast. I found the perk-cup cafe online and thought it would be great to try a new place for breakfast. The place was pretty empty and we still waited for a seat...it took a long time for our waitress to even make an initial visit. We have two daughters and the one is two years old so things can get hectic at times. Our two year old daughter had peed herself in her pull-up diaper. The seat got wet so I quickly rushed to the bathroom and retrieved paper towels. While I cleaned the seat and placed our daughter on paper towels the waitress finally showed up and asked what we needed for drink. Meanwhile my wife said to save from any further embarrassment we should wait after we place the order to take her to the car to change her. Thinking it should be quick for the waitress to return with our drinks and to take our order we started to get uncomfortable when she took a while. Our thought was that she noticed the accident and was talking about it to the other staff. When she returned to our table it was very awkward when she rudely asked about the accident and said \"I wouldn't want to sit in that seat after that.\" Instead of asking if we needed help or even being understanding that two year olds can have accidents, she decided to make us feel terrible about the entire incident. She was more consigned about the chair than offering to assist with this embarrassing moment. The mess was cleaned off of the vinyl chair and I had placed paper towels until my wife went to the car for another pull-up diaper. I then asked for the manager and she was also the owner, at first she sided with the waitress. After hearing my side she said that she will talk to the waitress about the incident. My wife and I took vacation to relax and not experience any stressful or unnecessary drama. We are both educated professionals and also manage people for a living, after seeing so many infractions on this visit, it was determined that we will not be visiting this establishment ever again. After reading other negative  postings and one about their two year old child that had to sit on his father's lap for breakfast due to lack of service, obviously this place is not a family friendly restaurant. What a let down. We did however went to another restaurant in downtown Olmsted falls, the waitress was delighted to assist our family! She was very polite and gave attention to our kids! What a difference it was and we were generous with the a 40% gratuity tip. We are people that usually give compliments to assure good service and it takes a lot for us to give negative feedback. Please reconsider this place if you are looking for breakfast as a family with kids. Business need to realize that all the customer wants is good service and to be understood when needing assistance. I really hope the staff and owner gets training in customer service."}
{"text":"Two coworkers and I met for brunch here as a last minute decision. One of the girls (who was coming with her baby) literally lived right around the corner and our plan was to head to Great Northern after so we decided to check this place out and boy were we glad we did!   Doesn't look like much on the outside, but he place is adorable. It has a bunch of tables with waiter service and then has some couches with a double fireplace where you can catch up with friends and just have coffee if you're not looking for anything sit-down. The decor is super cute, too. Very coffee-shop-esque.   For being a Wednesday morning, there were definitely a lot of tables full of people. We started off with some coffee, which was good. The breakfast menu is pretty big!! It was so hard to decide what to get, but I settled on a breakfast bake that had artichokes, tomatoes, spinach, hash browns, scrambled eggs, and cheese. It was delicious! It was baked in a ramekin so it stayed steaming hot during my entire meal which was nice. I got a biscuit instead of the toast. The biscuit was ok, a bit dry and could have used some more salt. My friends enjoyed their meals, as well.  The waitress was super friendly and came by often to refill coffee or make sure we didn't need anything else. Another employee (manager?) kept coming by as well, which was nice in the beginning but began to get pretty annoying. She kept interrupting conversation to talk to us about the baby or her childbirth experience.... we do NOT want to hear that during our meal. And like I said, while it was fine the first few times, the number of times she came over was just a bit much.  Overall, the food was great, the prices were very reasonable (9 dollars for my meal? I can def do that... she didn't charge us for any of our coffee which was nice), and the service was good. I will def come back here.   PS for those who live nearby, they have a drive thru if you prefer to grab your coffee and go!"}
