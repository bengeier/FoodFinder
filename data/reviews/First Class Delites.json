{"text":"This is a very local establishment. I am an obese Canadian male, I do not often earn respectful treatment as I have let myself go physically. I am close to 300 lbs. and could easily be well beyond that mark if I would allow myself to eat here more often. I love their freshly made chicken roti, pan fried and served with a dry curry (no sauce) for $6.75 including tax. I  could eat six of them at one sitting and need to stop myself at just one. Super friendly owners treat me as if I was their long lost, Caucasian, son. The food is terrific. Just don't expect anything fancy."}
{"text":"I gotta say this restaurant is my favorite!
\"Mom\" has had this restaurant for yrs here & I've been coming here & enjoying their chicken soup & red beans soup forever.
Their jerk chicken is to die for but I do luv moms\" curry goat & rice with a fresh crisp salad. To go or stay in its up to you.I know 1 visit here that you'll be back everytime & youll be greeted with a beautiful smile ;)"}
{"text":"One of the best Jerk chicken meals over had in awhile.
Staff and customers friendly and conversational.
Bible channel in the background. Great experience, looks a bit like a bar inside. Nothing special interior wise, who cares, great food."}
{"text":"After much extensive research, the results are in. First Class has the best jerk chicken in Toronto. Period."}
