{"text":"I go to this place on an almost regular basis, and I love it. It is a great place to sit and chill and look at cool artwork. It has a good hipster vibe, and a very good, reasonably priced drink menu. The only thing that I am not really a fan of is the live music, because some of the acts can be dodgy. Apart from that, it's pretty cool place to hang and be."}
{"text":"- nice space -- spacious, many tables, urban-ey feel to decor, and dog friendly! - tea was good -- loose leaf, decent selection, which is more than most cafes can say - food was okay -- got chicken salad sandwich with side of grapes. taste was good, croissant was a little stale (tasted a couple days old. maybe could have been masked if it was toasted), grapes were soft. - wifi was spotty. connection was good/fast, but would get kicked off once every few minutes. could re-connect right away with no problem, but annoying nonetheless. - barista's super friendly.  I want to give them a 4 because I liked the space and baristas so much, but since reliable internet service is the reason I go to cafes, I have to give a 3."}
{"text":"I've tried this coffee shop by both going in and using the drive through. The inside has an awesome atmosphere perfect for getting out of the house and focusing on some work. Also, the most important factor, the product is great. The coffee is tasty, large, and gets the job done. They also have a fantastic range of loose teas which they keep jarred so you can really check it out.   Basically, skip Starbucks and give this local coffee shop a try you won't go back."}
{"text":"Have not been at night but based off a traditional coffee shop, it's not conducive to studying. Food items seem interesting although I have not tried any."}
{"text":"After the customer service at my favorite coffee shop went to crap, I decided to try this place. I was pleased with the service. The place is very spacious, which I like. I would recommend trying this place if you haven't yet. The only flaw I have with this place, which isn't a big deal, is the hours that they close, I wish they were open a little bit later."}
{"text":"This place is very cute.  It could be more comfortable by adding more power plugs extensions and sun shades as  drapes doesn't really help with sun glare as thoroughly as it should.   Cashier/barista (in training, I'm guessing) had her eyes glued on her cellphone,  took her co-worker to call her to help me out.  I witnessed a customer ordered sandwich to the other cashier, it was forgotten to be made. Drink was good and be made excellent if it were less watery (forgiven, as she's still in training).  Will still comeback, as the people are nice and it isn't too loud."}
{"text":"If you want to jazz up your coffee or enjoy a simple coffee, check this place out! Also if possible, stay and enjoy the cozy atmosphere and open mic night! Great local musicians + great coffee = amazing night!"}
{"text":"Oh talebu a great drive through coffee. Great selections and variety. They have a great website  that displays their menu to look beforehand. Great place!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and ordered Iced Latte. It tasted really weird, like there was alcohol or something in it."}
{"text":"Took literally 27 minutes for them to make a smoothie which turned out not to be a smoothie. Mine was delayed, in part, because they made a caramel ice coffee \"on accident\" (their words), which they then offered to anyone who was willing to drink something that had been sitting on the bar for 15 minutes.  I was in favor of a $15 minimum wage but these people ruined it for everyone else."}
{"text":"I definitely do not recommend this coffee shop. My friend ordered a decaf chai and ended up with a drink that was more like a vanilla steamer. The muffin I got was rock hard and stale. Their coffee is less than average and the service was slow. This one man (the owner?) yelled across the counter at a coworker and the whole atmosphere was unprofessional and really rather awkward. Save your money and your time."}
{"text":"i love the atmosphere here. It reminds me a little of Seattle. The coffee is great and it is cheaper than you know who. And the service is fast. Also have open mic nights!!"}
{"text":"I frequent non-corporate coffee shops, and this one is one of my faves. Nice, open atmosphere, updated tables and chairs (finally), several couches to chill out on. I like this place during the day for coffee/tea/food, and at night for the wine/beer/food and entertainment. Great place to try if you are looking for a new place to hang out at."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Great fresh coffee and the baristas at very knowledgable and ask questions about how you specifically like your coffee. The place Is very roomy and inviting. They also serve wine and local craft beer. I will continue to come back as often as I can."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I go almost every week day! The baristas are extremely nice and the place is spacious. They also have a selection of drafts and wines that I have yet to try, but that will change soon hopefully!"}
{"text":"Their awesome during the week. But their weekend crew has huge inconsistencies in how the drinks taste. Give the weekend crew some retraining! They always forget to give me my stamp card back too!"}
{"text":"Loving this place since I moved to the are, even though I always mistakenly pronounce the name \"tableau\".   The dive through is always very fast; girls that work here really love when murph (my boxer) sits in front seat with me so hey can pet her while drinks are made. They also have dog treats and water bowls for your four legged friends"}
{"text":"I love how big and comfy this coffee shop is. The food and the drinks were good, but I was surprised at the lack of baked offerings late in the afternoon/evening-ish. I was in the mood for coffee and dessert on a different visit and the bakery trays were empty. It won't stop me from going back because they are very friendly and I enjoy the non-corporate vibe."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I have to say that the coffee is some of the best around. The customer service is great! The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. They have live music and a clean atmosphere. The reason for a 4 star review is because the breakfast sandwiches could definitely be better. I'm not going to write an in depth negative review about it because they have other breakfast options that I can work with AND the pros def outweigh the cons :) This is one of my new favorite spots for coffee, chess and a good chat!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's all about atmosphere for me and Talebu is somewhere I can come to get work done as well as enjoy a glass of wine with a friend or two. Mattie is usually the one working when I come in and I absolutely love her personality and she always takes care of me! I definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I've been going there for months now and I simply can't find anything wrong with the place. The staff is always friendly, the drinks are consistently delicious, and so far, everyone whom I have referred loves this place too.   My favorite drink is the Mexican Mocha. At first I thought the title was interesting, and asked about it. It has some additional spices that give it its extra zing such as nutmeg and cinnamon. Cold or hot, this drink is awesome. One of my friends is lactose intolerant and she likes that they have almond milk as a choice.   Lastly they have a rewards/punch card. Buy 10 drinks and get one free. Oh and Saturdays are double punch days! Can't go wrong with that! And its not like Starbucks where one purchase (regardless of amount) is a star, at Talebu they give you a mark PER DRINK. Its just too good!!  Love this coffee house!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Spacious, fun atmosphere, good coffee & good selection.    You have the option to hang out inside on comfy couches listening to good trendy music while checking out the art displays for sale on the walls.  Or enjoy the weather outside on their large patio.  If you are in a hurry, you even have the convenient option of a drive-thru!  I would definitely recommend making the trip inside if you can though and check out their delicious selection of pastries and sweets.  (They also have a small menu of other foods also, although I'm not as impressed with these.)  I have yet to make it to an open mic night but really want to one of these days soon. Especially after they get their liquor license and I can enjoy a drink after dinner.   My only complaint so far is that it seems like their prices might have increased recently.  But in all fairness, I don't ask for receipts typically so perhaps they could have always been the same cost and my memory is just failing.."}
{"text":"Talebu is a newer place, and I am a fan. I have tried the sandwiches, smoothies & a decaf caramella latte.The sandwiches and smoothies are really good, the sandwiches come with fresh fruit. I have tried the turkey sandwich that has pesto on it, and it was so good and really reasonably priced. They also have a couple breakfast sandwiches, I can't remember the name of it but the sandwich I got had pesto on it (can you tell I'm a fan of pesto?) and it was the perfect egg sandwich to wake me up. I've tried a few different smoothies here, but my favorite so far has to be the Starburst. It actually tastes like a starburst, imagine that ;). I am pregnant so I have yet to experience there real coffee, so for now I can only get the decaf carmella latte but you bet your booty I will be trying one of those delicious looking caffeinated beverages once I have this baby. The carmella latte is a tad too sweet for me so that is my only complaint. I do love that they have a drive thru, it makes it extremely convenient for 8 month pregnant women like me who really don't want to get out of our car and have to be in this disgusting heat. The employees have all been really friendly, especially who I'm assuming is the owner. They also have a whole punch card for there drinks, awesome! I believe they do double stamps on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Really liked the place when I was there last week. I tried that Mexican mocha but it was honestly a bit too spicy (in a cinnamon and nutmeg sort of way) for my taste. I like that they have board games and such all around the place, comfortable seating, and live music!  I'll definitely be back, I'll order something different, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"I Love this place!!! Coffee, wine bar, tea, food, live music, art, how much better can it get!? The staff is always very friendly and accommodating! I can literally spend all day studying in this place. They have free WiFi and their products are incredible!! some of the best coffee and teas around. Their sandwiches are so yummy! A huge plus is that they are open late! Not a single complaint so far."}
{"text":"Having just moved down from CO and looking for alternatives to Starbucks, I found this place and I will be back.  It's a big place, bigger than I usually like because it takes a lot of people to make it feel cozy.  That aside, the staff was very fast and friendly and my muffin was good, not great.  I would prefer a bolder roast for the coffee, but again, not bad.  Maybe my favorite thing about Tableu is the music soundtrack, a great blend of inspiring, not depressing songs from different genres and eras.  You won't hear hip-hop here, thank God!  Overall, a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I waited over 20 minutes for a sandwich. When I went to ask about it, I could plainly hear the girl say, \"I forgot it.\"   She apologized and said she forgot it because she was washing dishes. When she handed it to me I took one look at it and realized I had made a mistake. There was more bread than filling in my sandwich. And that's NOT due to the fact that the bread was fluffy, in fact the opposite. The smoothie I ordered tasted watered down. This is right around the corner from me but I doubt I'll be coming back. I don't ask for a lot when I go get coffee or a sandwich. So when even the simplest of requests is a problem - I can't in good consciousness support that business."}
{"text":"We decided to try this out with some friends who recommended it. They were closed two hours early on a Saturday night. The employees had called the owner and told him it was dead could be shut down early. There were 25 people sitting outside because it was open mic night so they were having an impromptu music session outside because they couldn't get in. There were six people still inside.  Two other couples besides ourselves walked up while we were standing there trying to decide what to do next. There was no way they weren't too busy. The owner needs to take a more active role. If we can't depend on the place to be open when it says it will then we can't depend on being able to go there."}
{"text":"Love this place! I give complex orders & they never make my frappe wrong! So friendly & just as fast as Starbucks! Great place to go if you want to support local businesses!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Talebu for several months now and I've never been disappointed. I love supporting this locally owned business - and there's no stuffy attitudes. The quality of the beans are outstanding and never bitter, DELICIOUS! I've held a couple staff meetings there and it's a great environment for one or many to gather."}
{"text":"I've had quite a few hot coffee drinks throughout the winter and same as the iced, they've all been delicious! Scones are tasty too. White mocha and Mexican mocha are my favorites! The staff is super friendly and they have free WiFi with abundant indoor and outdoor seating. Love supporting local coffee shops and even better when they serve GREAT coffee!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, with it being (presumably) local owned, but, eh. I went this morning, drive thru was empty but they only had one lady working (who was very sweet, apologetic about the wait and friendly!) , so the service was suuuuper slow, I was in the drive thru for 10 mins before ordering, luckily I was early for work so I had time, and I'd heard amazing things about their coffee so I figured it would be worth it. I ordered a flavored iced latte but it was pretty much tasteless, like sugar water, so not worth $5. Also perplexed by the fact the drive thru doesn't have a menu from a business perspective."}
{"text":"UPDATE!!!! THE OWNER CONTACTED ME BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE MY REVIEW. HE CALLED ME NAMES AND TOLD ME I WAS A PYSCHO! AS IF HE THOUGHT THAT WAS GONNA GO WELL FOR HIM.... I could give this Place 0 stars I would. They ARE NEVER OPEN ON TIME. It is 7am on Sunday. They were supposed to open at 6:30 am and the coffee shop is totally dark. And this isn't just a once in awhile thing. It happens ALL THE TIME! I've tried for over a year to give this place the benefit of the doubt, but everything has gone down hill. The quality of the food is ok if you like a frozen bagel that's still mostly frozen on your drive to work. Or maybe getting on 3/4 of a cup of coffee is cool with you, but not me!! So basically, don't waste your time, if there's even anyone there during business hours....."}
{"text":"I love this coffe shop, always friendly service, always delicious coffee that isn't over priced (I've been to sozo coffee and gotten their toddy, it wasn't tasty and it was way over priced) highly recommend anything here!"}
{"text":"I noticed this independent coffee shop while shopping in the area. The decor is minimalist, open, and light. The double expresso was good, as was the iced coffee. It was lunchtime, so I had the very reasonably priced and tasty spinach salad with fresh sliced strawberries, crumbled feta cheese and candied walnuts. The employees were knowledgable, friendly and service was quick. I noticed their tea is loose leaf. I resisted the pastry case, with a small but very tempting selection.   Definitely worth repeat visits."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the quiet  atmosphere here mid  morning a few times with my bestie.   The coffee was pretty good, nothing spectacular.   I would really like to go try the wine bar atmosphere...  I love the art on the walls. The service was kinda what you'd expect. Nothing bad,  but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Don't buy the $12 for $15 voucher. They won't accept it :( I was told that it is not in their system and they can't take it, so hopefully I get my money back for it. Disappointed. I do love this place though, atmosphere and food are great :) just don't buy that voucher"}
{"text":"I hate writing this review. I really do. I used to love this place, but it's gone downhill. I ordered a Mexican mocha and a kids hot chocolate. The hot chocolate tastes like hot water. Where's the chocolate? The Mexican mocha tasted like watered down black coffee with a hint of cinnamon. I don't know if they changed what they are using, but I'm not thrilled with the quality of my drinks. To top it off, the girl working the window had no personality and no manners. Handed me my drinks and stared at me. No smiling. No thank you. So I drove off in the most awkward situation possible. I'll give it one more shot, but I think I'll probably start looking for someplace new."}
{"text":"A new fave! Great Mexican mocha.  How have we never been here?! Great quiet  atmosphere for a Sunday morning. Surprisingly not busy."}
{"text":"its a cute, locally owned coffee shop that popped up fairly recently in the chandler area. the space is pretty huge and apparently hosts local musical talent from time to time. i also noticed that they give free refills when you are drinking in house. definitely a place i'll continue to frequent. P.S. - they are dog friendly too!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice coffee shop the mood is nice and cosy, barista was friendly and it was a nice relaxed environment. It is a good place if you want to hang out with your friends or read a book or work or study. Their outdoor seating is nice and i am definitely going back to this place to study. I loved it this will be my go to place !!"}
{"text":"Loved coming here. But recently the prices have increased quite a bit. Starbucks is actually almost $1.50 cheaper for the drink I get now. And my espresso was cold today not even luke warm, COLD, and they used almond milk instead of the coconut milk I requested. Not a hard order: espresso with coconut milk and raw sugar. Sadly I will probably be going to Starbucks down the street where the drinks are hot and less expensive (crazy)."}
{"text":"What a cool find, stopped in after dinner and was pleased to find live music, coffee, tea and a full bar too!  There are some sofas to relax on as well as tables, there is also a patio and a drive thru.    The drink options are plenty, ranging from coffees to smoothies to tea.  I chose the Mexican Coffee which was really tasty.  Another person in our group got a frozen drink called the Grasshopper which was like a liquid thin mint, YUMMM.  We found out it was open mic night and there was a lot of people waiting to perform. There were some great performances too.  We originally sat at a table and we were in the mood to chat which got us some pretty harsh looks so we moved outside to the patio.    Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee house with great music,   I had a beer, a snack and listened to some amazing talent.   Been there 3 times now!"}
{"text":"I love this place, best coffee in chandler! Not only is the coffee amazing but the owner and staff are just as wonderful!"}
{"text":"I love local coffee shops and especially ones that stay open in the evenings.  I am always looking for a place to hang out and study or just chill and Talebu has been just that for me since it opened.  I appreciate their open room and the atmosphere and would recommend this place to anyone looking to meet with others or just hang out and read a book.  At times, the music does get loud but I've never complained to the workers so I don't know if they would lower the volume for me but I don't mind and I think they'd take note of it if I did complain.   The owner appears to work hard and truly care about not only her shop but the workers and patrons which is always a good thing! I have ordered both hot specialty coffee drinks and their smoothies and enjoyed both.    Thank you Talebu!"}
{"text":"Love the space and the coffee! I got the divinity mocha with coconut milk (they have many options for the who are lactose intolerant, vegan etc.) and it was a little sweet, but very yummy. My husband got the mexican mocha and it was amazing! Who can say no to cinnamon and chocolate? :) We didnt order food, but the menu items look great and healthy so we will definitely be back to try them. I was also very impressed with the customer service-we were greeted immediately upon coming in and told we could have any drink we wanted made, not just what was on the menu. We were also invited to come back for live music that night, which we will definitely be back for soon. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"This place is very cosy, comfortable, the staff are extremely nice and the coffee is great.  Nice place to study or work with slow ambient music playing in the background."}
{"text":"Good coffee, bumbling service -- nobody got the food that they ordered.  Went for breakfast and coffee.  My group ordered 3 coffees and 2 breakfast sandwiches- forgot what they were called but they had eggs, Apple and Brie.  Got our coffees and sat down at a table.  After about 10 minutes of being there, someone came and told us that they didn't have the apples to make the sandwiches that were ordered.  Why it took 10 minutes to tell us that, I'm not sure.  My sister said she'll take the talebu sandwich (eggs pesto and spinach) instead and her husband said he'll just have the sandwich he ordered without the apples.  She said, \"oh I thought you guys only ordered/paid for one.\"  My sister said no, we ordered two.  She said let me check.  Then walked away saying \"okay one talebu sandwich\".  We said \"no, two:  one talebu and one Apple without the apples.\"  She said something about shed have to check if two were ordered and walked away (???)   A while later she comes with two identical sandwiches:  eggs and ham on a croissant (no Brie) and plops them on the table then rushes off.    The sandwiches were neither the talebu nor the one they ordered without the apples.  my sister and her husband ate them anyways and we left.  They looked like Burger King croissanwiches but less greasy.  Pretty crappy experience!  0 stars for the breakfast and service.  Two stars because the coffee is good with lots of variety, they have a drive through and the overall atmosphere is nice.  But don't order food!"}
{"text":"Went here for a concert/music event thing.   It was nice. Coffee is good. I had some of their beer and it was good. The only downside was that I felt it was all overpriced, but oh well.   It was all pretty good, worthy of 3 stars. Nothing to call my mother in law about."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this coffee shop by chance and so glad I did. This place is a hidden treasure. Tea was exceptionally good and muffin was homemade. Only wished I lived closure because this place is better than Starbucks."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop to visit when I need to get out of my office & a change of scenery is in order. My husband and I also enjoy going there on a Saturday or Sunday morning, getting a coffee and sitting and reading or chatting. I haven't been there at night yet to get wine or appetizers but I'm sure it's great too. The coffee is delicious and the prices are pretty typical. The girls there are consistently friendly and gracious. I'll go pick a table and if my drink is ready before I head back up to the counter, they walk it out to you. Just a nice touch I think. They also have a punch card, something Dunkin' Donuts doesn't have which is another nice benefit.   They have outlets along each wall so you can plug in a computer or laptop. They play music but not too loudly or obnoxiously."}
{"text":"Live music, lots of comfortable seating, and coffee drinks that are more than the standard Starbucks kind. I.e. I got the strawberry blonde mocha and it was phenomenal! It tasted like there was real strawberries in it! I also love the fact that they have a wine bar with ( what looks like) decently good wine selections. The punch card offering free drinks and specials will make me want to come back here"}
{"text":"I've lived around the corner from this place for quite some time and decided to give it a try a few months ago.  At first I was really impressed.  The drive-thru staff were very nice and always gave my dogs bones.  Despite my initial shock to a 24oz iced coffee costing almost $5 I was happy with the quality of the coffee.  They even had the FiveStars reward program.  Then it started going down hill.    The next few times I came by things got frustrating.  The drive-thru is EXTREMELY slow.  If you are headed to work, make sure you allot 15 min or more to get your coffee.  While I haven't experienced them not being open on time, they are never ready when they do open.  They are still turning things on and stocking what they need for the day which makes the process even longer.  The reward program is also rarely working, so despite being there 3 times a week for 2 months and spending $6 each visit, I haven't earned any rewards.  I ventured out one day and ordered a scone.  It was terrible.  The orange and cranberry flavor were good but I would be willing to bet it had been sitting in their case for several days.  It was as dry as sawdust.    The final straw was this morning.  I ordered my usual 32oz iced coffee with a splash of cream which is always $6.04.  Today it was $6.42 so I asked why the change.  I was told that the owner probably raised the price.  As she read it back she mentioned a charge for the \"splash\" of cream in my coffee.  I was never told there was a charge for a drop of cream.  Who does that??  I was informed it was because their cream was $8 a bottle.  That's not my problem and in my opinion just a cost the coffee shop should incur and not pass on to their customers.  I mentioned to the very nice lady at the drive-thru, that although the coffee is good, it's not twice as expensive as anywhere else good despite it being \"gourmet.\"  My advice would be to find another local coffee shop with good coffee and pay half as much."}
{"text":"In love with their Mexican mocha mudslide and the mudslide made with Kahula and amaretto. Either one you choose, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Fast wifi, mocha frapp is very tasty! Huge space. Great for groups and lots of comfortable seating. When looking around for a place to sit and work on your laptop midday this is a 10 star place. Inside is rather quiet and chill during the day. They do though seem to have quite a few people patronize the drive thru which is good. I would hate to see this place close due to lack of business. I've been telling everyone I know about Talebu."}
{"text":"The 3 stars are for the ambiance only. It's a nice big place with plenty of tables and cozy couches. Nice place to read or get some studying done. It was dead while i was there.   I ordered a latte. I'm not sure how or why you would water down a latte but I somehow ended up with a cup of hot water with a bit of coffee flavoring and a splash of milk. And it tastes like sink water. Un drinkable. I also spent my visit swatting at flies. Inside.  If I return I'll be drinking wine."}
{"text":"I got a DELICIOUS sandwich and a Mexican mocha cold brew at Talebu today, and sat and studied for hours! The atmosphere midday is perfect for work- its quiet and well-lit, with many seating options. I sat at the bar where there are numerous outlets, and enjoyed my sandwich with coconut oil baked chips and a fresh cookie! The baristas were helpful and kind. I can't wait to come back for fun- their wine bar and beer selection look like a perfect happy hour treat, and there's a stage just waiting for an acoustic set!"}
{"text":"Awwww MAN!!!!!  The open Mic'ers will miss you guys! Thanks for letting us all play!!"}
{"text":"Came here for my first time today, I was so glad to find a coffee spot that wasn't Starbucks nearby my house in Chandler.  I love this place! The interior is very loft-like which I totally dig. The staff was friendly and welcoming.  I ordered a Twister Mocha Latte, iced and with coconut milk - DELICIOUS.  I'm looking forward to trying the other interesting lattes on their menu.  PS. Did I mention they also have a wine bar?!?! You'll probably find me there after a stressful day of working remotely :]"}
{"text":"Talebu is where I spend ALL of my time. Seriously all of it. I spent 6 hours there yesterday. Every day after school, the kids of the CPA debate team come and do work over there. The regular baristas are nice and super happy and polite. Recently, however, I've had some concerns.   They hired some new baristas and they simply don't make the drinks well. Yesterday I had a Green Tea Frappe that tasted like it was watered down and near flavorless from the moment I got it. It would probably be wise for them to learn how to make the drinks before they're sold to customers.   Hopefully these baristas learn soon because I want to be there and enjoy my drink again XD not have to bear it just to support the place I love to be."}
{"text":"Usually really good.   Today I had the worst coffee I've ever had.   Tasted bitter and burnt.   Might be a while before I can go back."}
{"text":"Cool venue. Dark, open, with a stage and a bar. Latte was excellent, top notch. The iced chai was problematic. Too much cream, not enough ice, and it tasted like it was made hot with chai powder and then poured over ice. It had the consistency of melted ice cream. I'd definitely go back, but no more chai."}
{"text":"Sure, it wasn't 110 degrees like outside but it was 86 degrees inside the place according to the gage by the restrooms. I know. I know. Small business + big building = expensive air conditioning. But it was uncomfortable to sit in. No wonder this place was practically empty. Thank goodness I ordered a cold smoothie because the ceiling fans barely did anything to help cool down. I had a Peach Berry Blast. Good flavor and good size (24oz) for $4.15. Also, tried a slice of the Lemon Marscapone cake. It was good but mostly unmemorable. I probably won't be back unless it is winter or to try the drive-thru."}
{"text":"5 stars should be easy to attain for a coffee joint, but Talebu simply does not deserve even 2 stars, so I have downgraded it. First off, we go in at 3pm for a quick coffee. It was 2 minutes before the guy at the counter stopped counting the till before he said \"hey\". The. Another minute before the coffee girl took our order. We were the only two in the whole place. Anyways, again the coffee was not that good, the atmosphere... Meh, and the service, also just not that good. This will be my final review of Talebu and my final stop in for a coffee. Save your time and go to where you at least you know you are going to get a good cup of joe."}
{"text":"This is a cute little coffee place.  I love their lattes and they are so quick to make exactly what you want and super helpful.  I usually get some pastries when I go in for breakfast, their cinnamon rolls are really good, haven't been a huge fan of the muffins.   I would be interested in trying this place out on a Friday or Saturday night for the open mic night or other events they have going on to see it really busy, but either way I'll be back I'm when I need my latte fix. Definitely better than your everyday Starbucks drink!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  Totally chill atmosphere, loungy and comfy for a weekend morning coffee. Great coffee and good food (a couple egg/croissant choices and a few pastries). Definitely beats the Starbucks convertor belt and makes you want to kick back and slow down."}
{"text":"Really nice place to relax and have a drink with a friend ! Very friendly and nice service ! The place is really nice and comforting and the coffee is excellent with really good taste would recommend to any coffee lovers !"}
{"text":"Nice place with modern flair, and excellent hours.  This place is right near where I work so I was very excited to give it a try.  It just doesn't do it for me.  Another review said their espresso drink tasted more like a steamer, and I had the same experience.  I tried the carmella latte, and it was pretty much all syrup, very little espresso.  I couldn't finish it because it was so sweet.  Service was also very slow.  I think if they can work on the product a bit more, this place could be great."}
{"text":"Unfortunately wi-fi does not work. Although it may be a temporary issue, I had to change my plan to study. BTW, Mexican mocha is good. Interior design would be better. No idea for the wines but several coffee options. More charging options would be effective to come here again. I could not see enough charging sockets."}
{"text":"Great spot! A colleague suggested we meet here to collaborate on some work outside of the office. Plenty of tables. Very good wi-fi. But most of all, awesome coffee and superb service!"}
{"text":"I got home late Sunday evening, spent the weekend at the hospital with my daughter while she had her baby, and so when I got home I felt like I needed to spend some bonding time with my son and see if he was hungry and like most 17 year olds with a bottomless pit he was and said he would like Subway, so I told him lets go walk and get it, we don't live too far away and he likes to chat while we walk. I know, you're like dude this review is supposed to be for Talebu,,but wait for it,,,,,  We walked around the corner and saw these twinkling lights and a lit up patio area, and my son was like lets go investigate, so we did, and when he saw it was a coffee shop he about jumped for joy,,,he loves local coffee shops.  We walked in and he said I love the feel of the place, this will be my new hang out, we walked up to the counter and placed out order, then sat down at a chair, where he challenge me to a game of chess, but with the lack of sleep I knew if I did I was doomed.  We found out that Talebu has open mic night on Thursday nights and live music Friday and Saturday nights, and my son was told there was no age limit so even he can listen to the tunes. You betcha we will be there forsure!  I ordered a Caramel Frap, omg it was delicious! It tasted like a combo of caramel and butterscotch very yummy!    Glad to have found ya Talebu, you can bet we will be back!"}
{"text":"Got the Mexican mocha and the chunky monkey with banana, absolutely the best coffee I've tasted in Arizona.  Hands down.  We r definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop! I love stopping by and grabbing a mocha and a muffin. I appreciate the wifi and love that they are friendly to service animals."}
{"text":"Great little place. They've got a variety of different coffee and tea flavors, which is awesome, and plenty of variety. Their tea is great, and so is their coffee. Great deco. Loved the wall art and the whole feel of the place. Also, it was very comfortable and open, with couches and a nice atmosphere. Very friendly, laidback, and helpful workers. They've also got tables where you can play chess, which I thought was a kind of cool touch. Would definitely suggest it to anyone looking for a place to kick back and hang out for a while with some great coffee!"}
{"text":"This place is a complete disaster. There was no menu for the drive thru. After the young girl took our order, which seemed hard enough for her, the guy actually making our drinks had to ask us all again what we ordered. It took way too long for drive thru, probably 10 minutes. Then my Americano came hot when I asked for it iced - so the guy just pours it into a plastic cup with some ice. Now my drink is watered down because he was too lazy to remake it AND it's still warm. As a former barista I'm disgusted and will never be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Good coffee and espresso, super spacious and large tables with enough plugs for laptops! They also play good music and they hold painting classes and open mic nights!"}
{"text":"This place has so many homemade coffee selections I absolutely love it the Mexican mocha is my favorite over ice!! Definitely recommended it. I can't wait to go back and try more"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE local businesses!  And I am such a sucker for coffee shops.  They are so cute!  The best part about this coffee shop is the fact that it has a drive-thru.  To the owner who decided to add this perk--thank you!!  You are so smart!  Best drink?  Mexican mocha.  Love it! I get mine with almond milk and it tastes SO good!  I'll be frequenting this place more and more!"}
{"text":"So happy I've found a new coffee shop in the neighborhood! I love the cushy seating areas and the selection of coffee drinks. I can't wait to try their loose-leaf teas!   Friendly staff.  Live music. Excellent wine selection. Drive-thru!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I sent my daughter in law breakfast from Talebu through GrubHub. It was her birthday and I asked that the delivery person wish her a happy birthday. I'm so impressed that the staff took the time to decorate the container of her croissant and her coffee cup!! She said the food and drink were outstanding!! What a great experience in every way! Thank you for making both our days!!"}
{"text":"We held a private event to celebrate a birthday. Taren was wonderful meeting with us and going over all the details. She went out of her way to make sure we had decor that matched our theme and provided vegan food options. Talebu had the perfect vibe we were looking for and everyone had a wonderful time. I highly recommend having a private event at Talebu. The service was exceptional."}
{"text":"This is a must for all of you coffee fanatics.Talebu is a large space with lots of seating,and even has a wine bar.The drinks are stellar and the service couldn't be better.I like to take my dog with me in the car when we get our \"fix\" through the drive-thru window.See you there!"}
{"text":"This place is off the chain! Clean, plenty of seating, board games and fairly good beverages. My boyfriend and I LOVE this place. And he does not even drink coffee (likes to come for the chess boards). Anyone looking to get the HELL away from Starbucks; come here!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop :) Service is always wonderful. Their cold brew provides quite a kick for me to jumpstart my studying!! Their selection of teas are also badass. I like their peppermint green tea a lot. If I'm cramming for a final, I start off with a cold brew and at midpoint switch to the tea and it really keeps me focused for the whole day. I really love that I can zip through the drive-through too if I just want a quick drink while out on errands, especially in this Phoenix summer heat.   I usually come here on Sundays and from time to time they'll have cool local events at their venue. Sometimes they'll have local kids' recitals or live music or little art festivals. I like that they provide a space for these sorts of events. Doesn't affect me too much, I just sit at the bar facing away from everything and put in my headphones so I'm not disturbed at all. There are  outlets in the bar itself so it is very convenient.   One minor thing: I wish they opened til later on Sundays!! They close at 6pm unfortunately :P"}
{"text":"This place is only minutes away from my house been here before in the past and just went back again it's great! The girls were welcoming especially emily on of the baristas very accommodating and welcoming I'll be stopping here for my vanilla chai fix"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee place!! Try the mocha latte with peppermint and coconut milk... Sooo good! I have yet to try the drive thru because I just love the sitting area. They have punch cards for a free drink after you buy 10. What coffee place (that is good) does that? Plus they have a large dairy free milk selection. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Updated tables and seats with backs.   Usually fairly quiet during the morning and day. Nice atmosphere. Will be spending more time working here now that they have new tables."}
{"text":"I live in the area and visit this place frequently. There are many great things about this establishment such as; I like the free wifi, comfortable setting, friendly staff, awesome tea they sell for self brewing and their hot coffee/lattes! They have some light food options such as oatmeal and bagels which is nice as well.  The reason I cannot give 5 stars is the cold coffee never turns out great in my opinion. I love iced lattes and blended coffee on a hot summer morning however  whether I order iced or blended Coffee It always lacks the strong caffeine and tastes of pure ice and sweetness. The same cold beverage never tastes the same- no consistency with making the drinks so I started trying the hot drinks and found I do love the hot carmella latte.  The drive thru has no menu, which makes it hard if you're not a regular, and sometimes can take a little longer."}
{"text":"Coffee, wine, live music on a Friday- what more do you need?  I appreciate their good selection of sugar free add ins.  Got a sugar free mocha americano with heavy whipping cream. Yummmm and decent keto option.  Hubs got a dirty pumpkin pie chai.  He said is was fantastic. Really loved the vibe of this place.  Open mic night had some great performers and a supportive crown.  I will definitely be back during the week to work since they have free WiFi as well."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place two weekends ago after grocery shopping next door. Desperately needed a pick-me-up after a non-stop month of family and friends in town.   When corporate coffee (coughcoughSTARBUCKScough) frequents every corner in the Valley, it's always great to support local business!   Nice, open atmosphere, no cookie-cutter décor in sight. That's refreshing! This reminds me of a toned-down version of a coffee shop I used spend a lot of time at in Colorado. Homegirl Extraordinaire Missy F. will know exactly which one. ;)    Very friendly barista that didn't hesitate to chat with me about how my day was going, etc. Also told me about Open Mic Night Thursday and Live Music Friday. All ages . . . will definitely have to check this out, and bring my teenage sister!  She also gave me a coupon for a beverage if I came back on Friday when a band was there.   Normally, I just get an iced toddy or Americano when I go out. Not so keen on frou-frou \"coffee\" beverages, but the barista convinced me to try a Mexican Mocha.   While it tasted great, it was rather watered-down. I love a coffee that punches me in the face, not a half-assed attempt at waking me up.    Tip: Don't forget the check-in offer. $1 off any 24oz espresso bar drink!   Will I be back? Most likely. It's a new business; have to give it a chance, will definitely experiment with some of their other beverages and come back when I need a change of work venue.   Happy to have fresh, local business right down the street from my house! Looking forward to seeing this place grow!"}
{"text":"Been to almost all the local coffee shops and this is still my favorite. My new favorite thing here now is the 32oz iced loose leaf tea. Even better when they leave the bag in!  Orange / cinnamon is probably my favorite, but I like to mix it up. Many great flavors. The coffee here great too. The only thing I wish they had more of are outlets. The table on the back right as you walk in, over by the bathrooms area, has an outlet. That is the only table that has one right there."}
{"text":"BEST coffee, LOVELY (and roomy) atmosphere, FRIENDLY people, FOOD AND FUN!  This place is awesome.  You can relax to work or study with coffee by day, and sip wine and listen to live music by night!  There's also a drive-thru, in case you're in a hurry and need that pick-me-up!  My experience here was nothing short of delicious.  The staff was fantastic.  I definitely recommend this become your new hangout!"}
{"text":"3-18-13 Visited this place for the first time today with my daughter. I found them on groupon. I ordered an iced Mexican mocha, never heard of that drink and decided to try it out. It was pretty good, different, but good. I also ordered my daughter a mini chocolate pie. She liked it a lot. Very cute place, I wish it was cozier inside though (very open, modern and artsy). Its kind of tucked away around the corner but still easy to find. Can't wait to try another drink next time, it is a nice change from Starbucks. Update 3-19-13 tried their version of the white chocolate mocha and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"I went to this place a good amount before I decided it was worth the drive to Lux central and Be coffee in Phoenix. This place has so much potential to have better ambiance. Their decorations and lighting could use a huge makeover. Coffee and food are good. Service the last couple times I went was slow but they are always kind..."}
{"text":"Was looking for a coffee shop to get some work done that IS NOT Starbucks and stumbled upon this gem. So happy to find a place in Chandler that has a decent setting. Great chairs and couches fostering a comfortable environment to enjoy coffee. If the caffeine doesn't wake you up, the barista will. This guy is on point and spewing with energy. Super friendly staff, the coffee was alright but because they understand how to design a cafe, 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my go to coffee spot!   I discovered this little gem when I was driving to work one day. I happened to glance over and saw an open sign that led to a drive thru coffee. Hello! I drove up to the window and was greeted by the nicest barista! It took me a second to navigate the menu but they're really good about customizing orders so I was able to get just what I wanted. They have lots of hot/cold options as well as different teas and smoothies so there's always something different to try.  Another added bonus: If you are active military/veteran they'll give you a whopping 20% discount. Thank you Talebu for your generosity."}
{"text":"Coffee is still good but service was awful the last time I visited. We waited at the counter for a bit then a girl playing on her phone nearby let us know she wasn't on the clock, but someone else would be with us soon. Um... ok. We saw a girl in the kitchen working on some sandwiches and a guy behind the bar chatting with some people. The girl was at least working on something, the bartender was just lounging and chatting and never even flinched at the line beginning to form at the coffee counter. Maybe he was off the clock too? A guy finally took our order with no apology for the wait or even a greeting. Just \"can I get you something?\" When the drinks were finally done they came in crappy styrofoam cups. We wasted 15-20 min of our day. Too many other good coffee options in the area to return to one that just doesn't care."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place!  One:  they have a wide variety of adventurous flavors to tease the taste buds.  So far I've had the Mexican Mocha as a frap and iced.  I also tried the strawberry blonde - which does have espresso.  My favorite go-to is the chunky monkey and recently that with peanut butter.  These are all kind of dessert-like.  I had their soy vanilla iced latte.  I still have more to explore here.  Two:  What a great place to either study, gossip with friends, chit chat, etc.  I've seen them have a bottle and brush event here before.  They also have a stage for live music at certain times of the day.  I like how the place has couches and home furniture and decorative pieces throughout.  Three:  wine bar available.  Just in case.  Four:  They also have smoothies and food items.  Five:  drive through.  Six:  pleasant employees.   Seven:  More bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"love this place! so many seating options, comfy sofas, high top tables, a bar and more. coffee was great and they serve sandwiches, pastries and wine. staff was awesome and place is dog friendly. also has an outdoor pato thats covered plus a drive thru window and free wifi. there is live music some nights too."}
{"text":"LOVE the atmosphere. More coffee shops need to have this atmosphere. As for the coffee, I feel it is ok. I prefer a stronger brew and feel they can refine the end product of their drinks. I've had a blueberry muffin from here twice, and I though they were decent. Nothing to \"wow\" me, but better than I've had elsewhere. Keep going, Talebu...I enjoy having you in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The drive thru is so convenient. One of the best iced lattes in the area!  These guys definitely know their espresso! Reasonable prices and friendly service. This is my go to coffee place before work in the morning, for my midday coffee on my days off, and my any day afternoon pick me up! Perfect cold beverages for the summer heat!"}
{"text":"I see great things for this coffee shop. First off, I am a big fan of non-corporate coffee shops that make it feel welcoming to hang out and enjoy their space. And this place has plenty of it... SPACE, that is. I was tempted to simply go through the drive-thru to sample their coffee, but I had to check out the interior of the store. They have a relaxed vibe, interesting art displayed on the walls, and the coffee is delicious. I am intrigued by their dessert-like offerings (the cheesecake in a cup looks deeee-vine!), but I tend to restrain myself from the sweets if I am strong enough.  This place gets an extra star for the inclusion of a drive-thru window. I haven't found that in most coffeeshops I frequent around Phoenix. The proximity to my home will make this my on-the-fly must-have-caffeine destination. I can only hope that I will check out the evening entertainment here and continue to patronize an original coffee venue that is doing things right. Good on you, Talebu!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here, they have a string trio playing and they sound fantastic!  The coffee is also excellent. A very nice way to spend a Saturday evening!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this coffee shop!  I've been once so far and plan to go back.  We are both in grad school and need to find a place to study outside of the house!  :)  The coffee is good and the staff is nice.  The place is clean, including the bathroom.    There are cushy couches and tables for picking your spot.  They do have live music there on the weekends...   Only draw back is - if you go later in the afternoon you are there during the DJ's sound test, which can be a bit distracting.    I hope to go back to study and possibly for wine or beer in the evening. :)"}
{"text":"I love the coffees, teas and occasional glass of wine at Talebu.  The place has a great vibe with big couches to relax and chill with your friends.  It really is worth a visit.  The staff there is awesome, super friendly and great with suggestions.  The only downside is their sandwiches, either lower the price or add more filling.  The last one I got there I literally could not tell anything was in between the bread until I opened it up.  Disappointing because I am so sure they could do better.  If they improve their sandwiches I'll definitely add another star."}
{"text":"Super happy they offer coconut milk! Got a Vanilla Latte w/ that and it was wonderful :) Cute place, i just wish they could work on their customer service! :("}
{"text":"It's hard to say anything about an owner that is so cheap and greedy. Their coffee is good; their sandwiches are good also but they use these kids who perform music and give them one beverage of their choice for 2 hours work. As an accomplished musician having played with Grammy winners, I would have played there for almost nothing but I'm sure as hell not playing there for the beverage of my choice. Taren Burke, you should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a week ago. Not only was my vanilla/mocha latte delicious, I was greeted and served by two very sweet young ladies. Since it was my first time and I didn't know what to get, they were so nice in helping me figure it out. They made me a custom latte!! They won a forever customer!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since the last visit. No vegan pastries. They do have a laid back area inside and regular live entertainment. Very helpful. Check'em out! Peace"}
{"text":"Love this place! Who know you could get a cup of coffee, glass of wine and craft beer in the same place? Great selection too! Love the live music. Just the right volume to enjoy the music and still have a conversation! Thanks."}
{"text":"Bye bye Talebu...after coming here since they first opened I have always been a devoted fan! The drive thru service has been so awesome. After being gone for a month or so I came back and my 24 Oz mexican mocha that once cost me approximately 5 dollars was now 7 dollars!! That is CRAZY! So today is my last drink..I cannot in good conscience ever pay that amount."}
{"text":"This coffee shop has those coffee that fulfills my day. Not only because of the coffee taste, but also the fact that I supported a local business.   It was life changing when I met their Mexican mocha, and I stick to it. It's just that coffee.   If you are down for some coffee adventure and liked the idea of supporting local businesses, this is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff is so friendly and they have the tastiest coffee!!! They have a drive thru and also do band nights!! Check them out!"}
{"text":"Hold on to your credit card!  I purchased a 16 oz mocha.  Total was$4.19.  Receipt was sent to me via email.  I noticed the \"sweet darling\" behind the counter added $1.00 tip without my permission.  Really?  I complained to management and they apologized.  Did not refund the $1.00 though.  Place was empty with no customers.  Maybe this explains why!  I won't be back!  Very poor first impression for me."}
{"text":"I really like the quality of the staff. The first one I came here I was unimpressed so I stopped going. I met a friend here once real quick before they went on a big trip and I was impressed. I came back again for a study session. Very chill. The coffee was great. I had a dirty chai ice and I was pleasantly surprised that it was a powder and it tasted this. I am designating this my after work and weekend study spot and if I really start to love it I may just add that extra star!  I recently went to their open mic night (every Friday) and it was t my crowd, but they were supportive of me either way. Great people great drinks."}
{"text":"Great coffee and it's nice to have a glass of wine and beer for a selection too. Open mic music on Fridays, plenty of comfortable seating, indoors and outside.  Friendly staff and a crowd of usual suspects make it a pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"Coffee:  The most important meal of the day.  Today's \"meal\" was one I wish I passed up.  Mexican Mocha is always superb and the Grasshopper Frapp is great but something about today's order just killed mine and Mr. W's stomach.  Could it be food poisoning? Spoiled milk?  Uncleaned utensils?  How?  WHY!?  Talebu is a dark angsty spot in the daytime with amazing music and even has a swanky wine bar with SanTan on tap.  I've never had their food so I can't speak much on that.  Their pastries aren't as extensive as some of the other coffee shops.  There are a lot of couches for you to relax on, a chess table for those of you who love chess, and even open-mic nights on Thursdays.  High-tops and regular tables litter the area so there's plenty of seating.  The coffee selection seems a bit on the weaker end so if you want something that's strong and punches you in the teeth, Talebu might not be the place for that.  Such a pity but an all-day tummyache where medicine isn't helping is a no go for me.  It was a good run, Talebu."}
{"text":"Probably won't be back. It was fine but nothing special, super expensive and super short wine pores for the price. I had the caprese salad, it was good but kind of boring. Can't imagine people going back to drink alcohol with those prices and no happy hour. Didn't try the coffee so maybe that's good?!"}
{"text":"A fun place to go with a few friends; good coffee, good wine selection, good happy hour prices. Great (looking--haven't tried) pastries and deserts. Atmosphere is very much like a warehouse feel, plenty of seating space...but music is far too loud to get work done. This is more a place to socialize."}
{"text":"I'm not one for trying every new coffee shop that pops up, but it was convenient to pop in and check this pace out. The ambiance is nice, though a bit sparse, and they have the typical \"art\" on the walls and mandatory performance space. The reason I've giving four stars is because I don't like to order on-the-menu, and the woman was very receptive to my questions and requests. At Starbucks I'll get a look of frustration as the baristas try to figure out how to type my order into their registers and charge me for it, but this woman simply listened, put something in, and asked me questions as she made the drink. It made it feel like she was truly customizing it to my tastes.  I guess if I'd used the drive-thru or simply ordered a drink from the menu I might have a more generic or bad experience, but this was one time that watching and explaining what I liked truly paid off for me."}
{"text":"After having an unpleasant experience with messing up my coffee I couldn't help but go back for their delicious campana sandwich and their frappes ( I live 6 mins away) I have good experiences when I visit especially with Kaiya ( sorry I butchered your name) She is the only employee that stands out just because she is genuinely very sweet and pleasant to talk to. I'm sure there are boatloads of other regulars that can arrest to that. Her sweetness needs to rub off on the other employees!"}
