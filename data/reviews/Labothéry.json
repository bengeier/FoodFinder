{"text":"Went here for the first time and had such a fun experience. If it's your first time there someone usually helps you out pick whether you want a fruit tea or milk tea and how much sugar you would like either reg, brown sugar or maple syrup.  They even notice your flavors that you choose and will even tell you which ones go best together. It's a bit on the pricey side since they charge per flavor and topping. I got two toppings, two flavors and soy milk so it added up to about $8 for milk tea and there's only one size just letting you know. The whole experience was great and worth the wait and am willing to go back again!!"}
{"text":"If you want to get experience for making your own bubble tea, you can go to this place. 

 I went there on Sunday, it was really busy and such a long lineup (almost wait for 30mins to choose it). the staff was helpful tho. 

But, it is enough for going there once. Just for experience. Cute and smart idea :) 

Plus, My bubble tea was not good as i expected.."}
{"text":"Yes, the lineup is ridiculous. If you're a bubble tea afficionada though it is worth it. Myriads of selection with syrups, powders, teas, milk and toppings. Why didn't someone come up with this self-create experience sooner?! Staff here are quite knowledgeable...they will tell you if you're heading in the wrong direction"}
{"text":"I've come here twice since opening and have gotten both a fruit tea and a milk tea. i've tried a bunch of places in downtown and love bubble tea but the tea here was not very good. Every addition of sugar/etc cost an extra couple of dollars and each of my orders (just the basic tubes, 1 topping) ended up costing $7-8 which is much more than even other premium places like the Alley or Onezo. The tapioca here is too firm for my liking and you are unable to customize sugar on the syrups. It takes too much of the magic away for me as I can see the sugar syrup/power I'm putting into my tea. I love this concept but I disliked the execution."}
{"text":"Interesting concept, but ultimately dull and poor quality ingredients and flavours. Stick with better choices like the Alley"}
{"text":"Really good tapioca you can choose however much you want to put in your bubble tea also if you're going to get sweet syringes get the green tea it's so good I wish we had one closer to my house. Sometimes there is a long wait so don't go at lunchtime don't go in the evening either because it gets pretty busy"}
{"text":"This was definitely an interesting take to having bubble tea. I enjoyed the whole interactive process of creating your own beverage with a huge selection of options! Something I did regret though was adding the raspberry powder in spite of the warnings I did get from the \"Scientists\" (they warned me three times that it doesn't mix well, which I should have taken into consideration because it was VERY true). The whole process would determine the cost based on what you chose to add into your beverage, and they mix it for you too which was pretty nifty. I especially love how they call customers \"Doctor\", which definitely made the experience more immersive. I would definitely go again, I'd just be sure to avoid the raspberry powder and try one of the juice based bubble teas!"}
{"text":"Really cool new bobble tea concept 
You can create your own drink and add something else than just tapioca. If it's your first time they help you with the mix flavors so you don't fuck up. 

The only thing is that if you get too exited your drink would probably be around 7 dollars or even 10. 

The space is big although I don't like the big sharing tables lol"}
{"text":"Interesting concept! As a scientist myself, I was really intrigued and interested by the syringes, test tubes, Petri dishes, and other lab-themed items in the store. I enjoyed everything about the joint - except the wait. Granted, the store just opened, so there was probably a longer line and more people than there should've been, but it still took much longer than it should've. And to me, the fix is simple - just add another cash register! The one cashier was completely swamped and flustered it seemed, so adding another would help indefinitely. 

Other than that, the staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable - they prevented me and my friends from mixing bad flavors, and always seemed nice. The drink itself was nothing spectacular, but definitely acceptable. Take the wait time with a grain of salt, because the process is definitely something you should try once or so."}
{"text":"You really are just paying for the cool experience. But if you're looking for some good bubble tea do not go here. It's average at best. I got taro+white chocolate milk tea with brown sugar pearls. It tasted so watered down and the tapioca was so rubbery and you really do not get a normal size portion of tapioca because they are pre-portioned in these Petri dish-like containers. I like the concept as the staff are wearing lab coats and the whole DIY bubble tea is cool and they call you doctor when your order is ready BUT the bubble tea is just not good. 7$ for watered down milk tea and rubbery tapioca, a serious let down. 1 star for the service and another star for the concept. However, I'm willing to give it another chance and try out the fruit tea...

Update: I've tried the fruit tea and it wasn't too bad, I got a mixture of mango and passion fruit with popping passion fruit pearls. The only thing I will say about it is that you can't adjust the sweetness level. I recommend the fruit teas, the milk teas are just not good at all. My 2-star rating will remain, if anything I will give it a 2.5. This will not be my go to bubble tea place. I'll stick to my sharetea and tenren!"}
{"text":"The concept behind this store is interesting and definitely makes it unique. It makes the bubble tea creation process more interactive; however, at the end of the day it is fairly gimmicky. Might not be a good idea if you're very indecisive! 

You start by choosing if you want:
 1) hot or cold
2) milk based or syrup based - which flavours you want
3) sugar levels - maple ($1 extra), brown, or regular 
4) milk (evaporated or fresh)
5) toppings (boba, jellies, tapioca)
6) tea (green, black, oolong)

To select the flavour and sugar level you select the tube that you want, and when you're ready you give it all to the staff or \"scientists\" will combine everything together for you. 

I got the red bean, sesame with \"original\" (they recommend you get it). When I asked what tea would work well, they suggested a green tea. Even though I wouldn't come back for the experience, I did think that this was a really good combination! It had a really strong fragrance, and the flavours blended really well (my friends couldn't figure out what was inside when they tried it). 

There's not a lot of seating either, it's pretty minimalistic. Also, there's a durian flavour, and at one point it was extremely pungent (and slightly nauseating.)"}
{"text":"A superb novel idea for bubble tea! This place calls for all wanna-be chemists to interact with a beloved beverage. The options here are quite amazing with either hot or cold fresh or milka tea. The bases are either black, green or oolong tea. There are jellies, red beans, pearls and tapioca. The choice of sugars go from 10-30mL with either maple syrup, white or brown sugar. You can select to even have a slushie!

Yet with endless options, decision-making can be difficult especially considering the establishment has a line up with a tray system. It takes a LONG time to get through the line. However, it tastes great and there is a quick turnaround in the bubble tea coming out. One flaw is that it is rather cramped and people will line up outside and around the few tables at the location. Additionally, without much guidance from staff beyond \"choose two flavours\" can led to some unpleasant beverage experiences. I went with my boyfriend who definitely selected his ingredients better than I had. So alas! 

It's fun to go to but will I go again? Probably not but hey! You never know and who doesn't love to be called a Doctor on their bubble tea cup?!"}
{"text":"The tea was surprisingly good! Better then what I was expecting after reading the reviews for the place. 

The guy was really helpful and made great suggestions that saved my tea. Originally I went to the register with one syrup but he told us that it would taste watery so he gave me a syrup from the back that they didn't have on display. It tasted amazing! 

Mango and passion fruit is what I ended up choosing for both the strips and boba/pearls. The mix of boba and pearls was amazing because of there different textures. The place was really nice and they had lots of instagramable spots that made for great photos!! 

Overall loved it. Four stars only because it was a bit super sweet but that's the only thing I would change."}
{"text":"I had the chance to finally try out this bubble tea and it didn't entirely live up to my expectations. It was cool and all to pick what flavours you want and act like a scientist when picking up your ingredients that were served in syringes and test tubes. The price for the bubble tea can really add up if you add extra vials and extra syringes so beware of that. The employees there also really pushed the idea of grabbing another vial to make the bubble tea creamy and it kind of felt as if they were trying to scam us and rip us off. The one thing that disappointed me was how we weren't physically allowed to make the bubble tea which makes sense but it would have been super cool to completely make the bubble tea. My bubble tea ended up costing $7. It's a great place to go once but maybe not all the time."}
{"text":"I went here on a Wednesday late afternoon.  Taste wise, this is objective because everyone makes their own so majority of this review is based on cleanliness, service and quality. Great location, aesthetically pleasing & such welcoming staff! Knowledgeable and helpful staff are there if you need further explaining and assistance. I chose matcha sesame soy milk bubble tea. Their tapioca tastes soo good, similar to chatime. As a group we ordered 3 different kinds of bubble all of which tasted great!! I definitely recommend trying their brown sugar boba for those with a sweet tooth! So yummy! they have a unique array of flavours for both milk and black/green tea options hot and cold. I paid 7.25$ (they only have one size) and the coolest part is they have a partnership with khiels! I got a couple of free samples. This place is worth the try but don't know if I would come here often- pricey and a lot of thinking just for a bubble tea."}
{"text":"The bubble tea is pretty good and the whole idea of you creating your own unique bubble tea is pretty different and not something you see often. It is a bit time consuming the process so if you're looking for bubble tea, you're better off going elsewhere. However, if you haven't been before, it is definitely good to check out and I feel like its one of those places where you go to once for the experience and not go back. It can also be on the pricier side as well"}
{"text":"Love the concept and the cashier is so nice!! Although the half sugar tastes like no sugar and brown sugar boba wasn't what I expected it to be, I asked the cashier to  remake it  to a sweeter drink with regular tapioca -- which they did. 4/5 stars for u! Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"In the world today of customizing everything to your liking, Labothery came on the coat tails of that trend, bridging chemistry and make your own into the world of bubble tea.

They have really friendly staff members to help you with whatever questions you needed, especially since it is really confusing. You essentially choose what flavours you want, the tubes of powder if you're getting a milk drink, and the syringes if you're getting a fresh tea. It is especially confusing if you're getting the milk drink because in addition to the flavours (i got matcha and red bean), you need a base flavour and a jar of evaporated milk. Then it gets to the fun part of choosing toppings. They have everything from the classic pearls, to coffee jelly. I indulged in some of their bobas - the yogurt flavour namely. My bill was about $7 in the end, a steep price when it comes to customizability I guess. My conclusion? Gimmicky, but never again. The milk tea ended up really watery, which was such a disappointment. My friend that got the fresh tea (combination of rose and peach) that actually tasted a lot better, and was of a much lower price point too. If you do want to give the place a try, definitely stay with the fresh teas, as the milk teas really do not turn out as a well.

In addition, the environmentalist in me is actually really concerned about places like this. We know bubble tea places aren't the most eco-friendly with the straws, the single used cups, and the plastic topping. This place has the addition plastic of the syringes (that seemed to be single use), and the Petri dishes, that all seem like extra waste. Hopefully they  recycle some of this, or put in some implementation of a reduction of it. 

Overall, gimmicky, fun, worth a try, but that's about it."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go to if you're already in the DT area. Its simple to understand and the workers there try and help you and give suggestions as well. I thought it was going to be more interactive than just placing your ingredients on a tray and getting them to make it for you. I got the fresh tea even tho I generally like milk tea more, just because I didn't find that they had a lot of variety in powders for the milk tea. I was def happy with my drink but I dont think it's worth the hype much. It's a fairly small place but they do have seating which is nice."}
{"text":"Just like any other Bubble tea place, but it's all about the hype right! Nonetheless it was a fun experience and the whole theme was cool."}
{"text":"This place was on my list of must visits after seeing the video on blogTO. Layout of the store is really cool. Clear but also A LOT of instructions/rules on the walls. Picking out flavors to mix and match is a little confusing and overwhelming when there's a line behind you, but the friendly scientists are super helpful! I really wanted the sesame because that's such an uncommon bbt flavor. The girl recommended matcha with it and to add the original tube for \"extra creamy\" flavor. THOSE 2 FLAVORS GO SO WELL TOGETHER. Ordered it with a green tea base. Seriously guys...the experience is super unique, but the drinks are also really tasty. Quite pricy but worth it in my opinion. There's no other places with concepts like this. Definitely recommend as a must go, even just once!"}
{"text":"Location/Service
- Along Bay street, near College intersection. Street parking available, I believe there's also paid parking as well
- Located below one of the condo building. The sign is pretty bright, so it's not hard to miss
- Decor setup is similar to an actual lab, large space with metal tables/chairs, large chalkboard. I also like their paintings on the wall
- Also offer a picture section where you can wear a lab coat 
- Staff were pretty friendly and does offer recommendations based on what you selected to make sure you don't overdo your drink

Drink
- I will give props to their concept. You're like an experimental scientist, choosing a syringe/test tube of flavors (interesting ones like Durian, Rose), sugar level (Maple Syrup as an option), petri dish topics (tapioca, aloe vera, etc) and tea base (which I chose Oolong for this drink)
- It's very personalized and they write your name on the bottle, referring you as a \"Doctor\"
- But the drink itself was mediocre. I think bubble tea in Toronto now has changed more to focus really on the actual tea, its origin and taste - which I do not find it here at all. It's more like regular tea I can buy from the supermarket
- The drink at the end came to around $6.50. Do be careful and not to overload on the flavors/toppings, cause they do add up

Overall this place is okay. It recently opened so there's a lot of waiting (waited for an hour at 8:30pm, and they close at 9pm). If you're creative or feeling adventurous, it's a nice experience - but I'm not sure if it gives that addictive feeling like other chains that would make you want to comeback."}
{"text":"Excellent, Unique Experience. Excellent Service.

This bubble tea \"lab\" has gained some hype over social media so I decided to check it out. The place smells like a bubble tea palace. You can put anything you want and however much you want. The staff help out those who are stumped on what to get and they give their personal recommendations. Price-wise, my entire bill came out to about $7.25 +tax, meaning I put too many things in my bubble tea, so my advice is to keep it sweet and simple! Overall, an excellent experience to bring your friends, fellow students, or guests from out of town."}
{"text":"New concept bubble tea shop where you perform your own alchemy by choosing which flavours and toppings to mix together with. It's a pretty neat idea but in reality (as a first time visitor) it was quite a confusing experience.

Overall store design was simple and uniform. A few long tables on one side for seating and the line-up lab on the other. I would say the seating was a bit weird - unless you don't mind sharing a table with another group, each table was larger than usual bubble tea places.

When I first entered the shop and lined up for their bubble tea, there were instructional signage and \"tips\" on the wall. However, those tips were confusing if you don't know the process or how the lab flows. Thankfully, the staff there acting as the scientist were there to teach. The staff asked us if we are first timers and if we are, they guided us on our choices eg. Milk base or non-milk base, fruity or not, and then gradually there is a mini cabinet where you can choose the toppings. 

Cute thing is that during the line-up, it reminded me of back when I was still in school getting lunch using a cafeteria tray. And lastly, you get to pick the type of tea going with all the flavours.

I enjoyed the experience but personally, it was about the gimmick than the actual bubble tea. Relative to other places, I found their drinks more expensive. I also always stick to either less sugar or no sugar, but at Labothery you are not able to adjust the sugar levels."}
{"text":"Another place that I checked out because of a BlogTO feature - long story short, I would only recommend going here once for the aesthetic but not multiple times thereafter! 

This is basically a lab-themed bubble tea shop where you pick your own flavors and toppings. You pick a hot or cold drink, flavor profile, sugar (white/brown/maple syrup - 10/20/30%), milk, and tapioca vs jelly (different flavors). I'll give them credit for trying a new concept in a city where aesthetic is everything, but they still need to iron a lot of wrinkles out. Honestly it's pretty confusing what flavors you can/can't combine, and the guy at the front explaining can't keep up with the volumes of customers. Essentially you can't combine the syrup flavors (cold drink) with the powder flavors (hot drinks) and can pick up to 1 or 2 flavors depending on if you get a hot or cold drink. I went with two other people, and we all tried different flavors but came to the same conclusion - the flavors do not mix well at all! My matcha coconut milk tea didn't come out as expected at all, and my friends said the same for their drinks. 

Price wise, this place is ridiculously expensive. I get it - you're paying for the novelty of the concept but charging $3.25 for a cup, $1 per flavor, $0.5-1 for milk, and $1 per topping means that each drink comes out to around $7-8. The only thing that's free is the sugar, and even that costs extra if you want maple syrup instead of white/brown sugar. There are much better bubble tea places in the city that don't break the bank!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I come here quite often, living around the corner. The price is reasonable (my drinks usually end up around 6$ with double toppings) and I get to be creative with what I want.

Some of the combos I've tried are:
1) Rose Lychee fresh green tea with lychee popping boba and lychee peals
2) Mango Rose fresh green tea with mango popping boba and mango pearls
3) Guava Rose fresh green tea with mango popping boba and lychee pearls

You can obviously see a trend of my tastes, with the rose, but it's very tasty! I would highly recommend their fruit pearls, I'm fairly sure they make their own so they have great flavour and texture! The milk teas are also very good there too but I tend to avoid dairy when I can.

I wouldn't recommend coming here if there's a line, but when its empty I would say go and get creative. There's so many flavours to choose from, just have a general sense of what would taste well together and you're golden. I would say from my experience from about 12-3 Monday-Friday it's fairly quiet, and random times on weekends.

Also the staff there is very nice, helping you choose something tasty if you need help. Also the reward stamp card is very worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is more for pictures, the idea is that you can combine your own flavours of bubble tea. I feel like most bubble tea places like Chatime have a huge menu anyways and I usually go for a simply roasted milk tea. I also don't like the quantity of toppings that come in the petri dishes (very little) for such a large bubble tea. I also don't like that you have to pick Large. The menu/pricing is also unclear... each bubble tea will end up costing you $6.50 or more. Something to note is that the flavours that they have change everyday, I do appreciate the variety of pearls they have. Definitely somewhere I'd visit once then go back to Chatime. 

PS you don't actually make the bubble tea, you only pick out the flavours and give it to the cashier, then you have to wait"}
{"text":"The 1st drink I made was a basic cold tea with 2 rose flavoured syringes, no sugar, and additional tapioca. The 2nd was a cold tea with 1 rose syringe, 1 passion fruit syringe, no sugar, and lychee jelly. 

Both drinks were solid! The flavours were intense and tasty. If you're choosing flavoured syringes for a fresh tea drink, definitely skip the sugar since the syrup is already sweetened.

However, the downside is that there didn't seem to be a lot of toppings in each \"petri dish\" (I know that sounds weird but when you go, you'll know what I mean by that, haha).

Both drinks came out to $13 exactly. While a bit pricier than other bubble tea spots in the area, you get the added benefit of experimenting with your drink."}
{"text":"Checked out this cute lab-themed bubble tea shop and it was pretty cool. The interior was spacious with plenty of seating. 

It took me a while to decide on which flavour to try and finally settled on making a unique combination with durian and banana flavoured bubble tea powder with maple syrup. It was pretty tasty and adding evaporated milk made the drink a bit creamier. It is an interesting concept but can get pretty pricey if you add too many toppings. Overall it was a great experience and would likely go again to make some crazy combinations."}
{"text":"The concept is simple yet fun. You pick your own flavours both syrup or milk powder with flavour, sugar levels, toppings, milks, and your tea base. Pick hot or cold and then you pay they make and you enjoy. 

The fun is in the details. The fun little syringes labelled with flavour syrups, the almost like urine sample cups of soy or condensed milk, the Petri dishes of jellies and pearls. It all come together on a surgical tray and then even call you doctor as they call up your drink by whatever name you give. The servers are all dressed up as lab assistants and are all really helpful and cheery. 

The overall flavour is going to be your own creation for better or worse, so you can't blame them for it being too sweet, and they will warn you if you pick a syrup base that adding sugar isn't necessary. The same might now be said about the jellies or pearls (popping bobas) but if you've ever had froyo you're familiar with the sweet juices that fish out of these. 

The surprise for me are the flavours. They have ginger syrup which taste and has the kick of ginger. Rose, Guava, kiwi and winter melting which aren't always the standard flavours. Soy milk was also a pleasant surprise as most people know that most Asian BBT places don't have non dairy options for you. 

The overall price varies when depending how much you load up but for $7.05 I got two flavours syrups two toppings and a large size cup. Fair price by my regards. I would say the one drawback is that this place can make you easily lose track of how the cost adds up by the time you get to the cashier, but I mean if you have a pretty solid drink, isn't you're own creation pricelsss anyways. 

Hard to find fault with this place. I will say though the syringes and Petri dishes can get sticky if the person before you mishandled them or spilled."}
{"text":"Fun experience! Lineup and wait was long bc the place is still new, but honestly my friends and I didn't notice bc we were so busy looking at all the flavours and trying to think of our combinations. My bubble tea didn't come out great bc of my choice of flavours (white chocolate and raspberry milk tea), it tasted kinda floral and I'm not a fan of floral. But overall good experience, me friends and I agreed that we would definitely try again and experiment with other flavours too."}
{"text":"Crafting bubble tea like a mad scientist, yes please! This spot opened up a couple weeks ago, and after the hype on blogTO and seeing friends visiting through social media, I wanted to give it a try.  They offer hot and cold make-your-own bubble tea. My boyfriend and I came to visit on a Wednesday around 5pm, there was a line, and from entering to leaving, it took us about 30 mins. This place stands apart from other bubble tea spots because of your ability to fully customize your order, from temperature, type of tea, and flavours to addition of milk, sugar type and amount, and toppings. A little pricier than your average bubble tea (mine came to $7.50), but the experience was cool. My flavour combo was great and I love that they have soy milk! Would highly recommend to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place was cool! It's an interesting concept and though I thought it was the ideal ig spot, if I'm being honest I'd only go there once. The bubble tea was Okay, likely cause I made it myself and it was quite expensive. If you want to make a really good bubble tea like they serve at other spots you have to add a lot of extras. Let me explain, tapioca, flavours, lychee, etc. are all add ons and cost you extra to add to your drink. If you want your drink to be super flavorful you'll be paying a lot in add ons. The tapioca extras are very small so you have go pick up a few of them if you want a good amount of tapioca in your drink. Overall it was a good experience but I wouldn't make this my go to spot for bubble tea."}
{"text":"I went into this thinking I would creat something crazy with a lot of different options. The order in creating your own drinks are actually very basic and easy. It's more of a fun hands on way of drinking bubble tea.....in my opinion bring a date! It's a great ice breaker place with good music playing. My brother and I loved the clean simple layout and were singing along to the trendy music. I would definitely come back to try a more adventurous flavour."}
{"text":"Cool but sorta broken concept. 

The entire set up is cafeteria style where you pick and choose exactly what you want to go in your beverage sort of making this a very personal type of concept.

After going thru what's what and if I can put this with that. I chose matcha and coconut powder base, 60% sugar with milk and in a slushy format. It didn't turn out the way I would've wanted it to, the flavours were very muted and although my drink was green it didn't have a matcha taste AT ALL. My girlfriend got a peach mango green tea with mango boba and it was actually pretty good. The total for the two drinks was $13 tax in which is a little more expensive than competitors down the street.

until they change how they have their tapioca laid out I would recommend AGAINST getting it as a topping because it's just hard and chewy when it is left out the way it is. 

The staff were friendly guiding thru the steps with unfamiliar customers. They have 2-3 baristas working making the line more bearable considering it moved in a decent pace. 

The tea-shop is not crammed at all and is easy to navigate thru as it is vey spaced out.

Overall I would give another chance but coming here would not be my first opinion so who knows when that is going to happenS ."}

{"text":"Pretty cool concept! You can basically make any type of tea you want - you can choose between milk tea, fresh tea, or slush and whether you want a syrup or powder flavor... so may options! I tried the banana and white chocolate powder milk tea and it was great, although the banana was a little overpowering. You also get to choose your type of toppings - boba, tapioca etc., and level of sweetness. From all the reviews it seemed that people were saying to go with two evaporated milks, however the staff member said that that would probably be too much, so I went with one and it was good enough

The staff there are all really helpful and give good advice of flavor combinations, especially if you can't make up your mind - it can be overwhelming!

Also be prepared to wait a long time - the line-up is from the counter all the way to the door and it took us about an hour to get to the front to start ordering! Its a really unique place and would recommend coming at least one time for the experience."}
{"text":"I came here in a trip from New York super excited to try this place from seeing it on a video from social media. The concept is super cute and all, but sadly it was a let down. You walk in and immediately you see syringes with flavored syrups, test tubes of flavored milk tea powder, and syringes of sugar. I have to admit I was pretty excited, but all I really wanted was a plain milk tea. They did have someone standing there talking to customers and giving suggestions, but if there's a line forming behind you, it's hard to not feel pressured to take what you think you need and go. The worker was super nice, I told her I wanted just a plain milk tea. She told me to grab two original test tubes of powder and sugar, she suggested the highest level of sugar and I told her I usually don't take my drinks sweet and asked if the tea has a strong tea flavor so I settled for the syringe of 20ml? Of sugar with it. They had a fridge of different flavored popping bobas, aloe, jelly, and tapioca. I chose to have black tea as my base. I paid about $6? I think. This place follows through with the whole lab theme as they call customers doctor to pick up their drink.

Excited to finally take a sip of my drink, I was super disappointed. There was no tea taste, and little trace of sugar. I'm usually fine with no sugar if the tea flavor was strong, but at this point I felt like I was just drinking milk powdered flavored water. I took a few sips and tossed it out. My other friends had a better experience but wasn't amaze with their drinks either. 

I would suggest maybe a list or menu of suggested or popular combinations, the process can be overwhelming because there are so many choices of everything and it's hard to think about what will go well together. The workers were nice and patient. The place has a lot of space and minimalistic detail. The products themselves are just lacking."}
{"text":"Bubble tea on a next level thing. 

Was quite excited to visit and just the thought of handpicking all the ingredients made it worth the while.

This place has such a cute and unique take on a scientists (in little lab coats) concocting delicious bubble teas at will.  

Interesting theme and it just makes so much sense. 

I truly like the idea how there is someone at the front who is ready to explain all the flavors and combinations all the while providing you with excellent recommendations. 

You literally walk in, take a metal tray and choose items from little test tubes, syringes and petri dishes. 

There are so many flavors to choose, types of sugars, and flavored boba to choose from - like NOTHING I have seen before.

I wish they had more locations as this is a perfect way to ensure accuracy and perfect boba everytime."}
{"text":"Came here with a mission. My dude was grumpy the whole time because of the hour-long wait to smack a few tubes and syringes on a metallic tray. 

So they run this place with a lab theme, all the way to calling your name Starbucks-esque with the prefix \"Dr\", like \"Dr. Michelle\". So that was cute. The staff had lab coats and were helping customers decide which tubes/syringes they wanted. They kept the place pretty well-stocked even in the busy hour of 6pm on a Saturday. 

So here's how it works. You grab a hot or cold cup. Syringes hold syrups, and test tubes hold powders. You canNOT mix syringes and tubes together. Syrups are for tea bases (oolong, black, green), and powders are for milk tea. Hot drinks require just one tube or one syringe. Cold drinks require two. 

So you make your selection, put it on a metal tray, and then you move down the line. You can even select regular sugar, brown sugar, or maple syrup sugar (that's +$1). 

Price chart is in the pics.

You add toppings at the end, and they have a whole lot of different ones!! They have jellies and pearls of different flavours.

Taste was mad fresh and I loved it. I loved how my dude described it as looking \"radioactive\". 

My combo was: oolong tea base with peach and lychee syrups, green apple jelly and yogurt pearls.

GET PEARLS. Pearls pop when you bite into them and you literally get an explosion of flavour. 

So why 3*? Because you don't actually get to inject syrups into your drink. You hand off your tray to the staff and they make it for you, then they call you up when your drink is ready. Also, my drink cost $7. Yikes."}
{"text":"Concept was ok, and atmosphere was ok too. But taste was just normal. Interesting place btw."}
{"text":"I like it because: 
- Unique concept of getting your bubble tea fix compared to other bbt stores
- Huge variety of flavours, toppings, sugar and milk.
- Beautiful before and after - Insta-worthy.

I don't like it because: 
- For cold drinks, they \"recommend\" you to get 2 syringes or 2 test tubes. I didn't want to pay much as each syringe you get is +$1 but I was told that I have to get 2 otherwise the flavour won't be strong enough so I got 2 and it tasted too sweet for me. The next time, I wanted to get 1 only again and was told the same thing. I then explained that I found it too sweet so I'd prefer to take 1, she recommended me to get 2, and for the 2nd one, to ask the cashier that I want only half or a quater (??) What's the point of paying another $1 if I'll be using only a fraction of it? I might just get the sugar for free.
- Expensive. For a cold drink, the average price is $5.75 + tax (with 1 topping)."}
{"text":"There is definitely novelty in the concept but aside from that there isn't much. Bubble teas here are highly personalizable but also come with a hefty cost of $7+ for a drink with toppings and milk. 

The taste is very average and powder/syrup based and the re-use of the test tubes and petri dishes (for boba storage) isnt exactly the most sterile practice. 

Prices hover around $5-$8 for a bubble tea depending on how much milk/topping and syrup you wish to add."}
{"text":"They have amazing customer service. An intoxicated man came in and harassed the baristas with crude comments yet they kept their composure and were polite to him the entire time. They tried to help him get a tea and treated him well and didn't disturb the customers with the situation. I'm glad they have such great baristas handle such a tough situation. The tea's good too."}
{"text":"The idea and concept is actually a great experience. The tea itself was average, nothing special. Toppings are normal."}
{"text":"All hype, no substance. 

The gimmicky concept is fun in the same way building your own furniture has a certain charm.

Their drinks, especially milk drinks, carries 0 flavour, and tastes like sewer water (i have tried all the different tea bases). 
Their syrup drinks are over sugary and reminiscent?  of koolaid, very over powering.

On top of their awful drinks, confusing rules, their base price for their drinks (based on their rules for building? your own) come to $7. I will happily skip the $2 extra and just select my own flavours from a regular menu, to have a decent tasting drink from the many other bubble tea places like One Zo, Bubble Republic, Long Tea, Kekou Gelato(surprisingly!) instead of this trash water you want to throw out after 3 sips."}
{"text":"Novel concept of customizing your own drink! Staff was informative in explaining how it works, and the entire theme was fun for the inner nerd! Decor was amazing too, and we didnt have to wait at all! Fun part of it all was staff calling your name for the drink \"Dr. XXXXX!\" 

Drinks:
1. Red grapefruit+passion fruit, lychee boba in black tea
2. Mango+ kumquat, banana pearls in slushee
*Both of the drinks costed ~$14 and tasted really good

Downside:
1. Prices should have been slightly more transparent, e.g. on the white wall to the right when you first enter
2. Can include more topping choices, however this is a new shop, so hopefully they might have even more to add on to in the future"}
{"text":"i'm amazed with the new concept. 
i love mix and match!! I tried the durian X banana and it's actually very nice. For those who like durian should have a try!
will definitely go back to try more combination."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Place is pretty lively with a lab like theme. Decent amount of seating but there is quite a line up. Probably took 20 minutes for the entire process.

There are several rules that complicate the buying process but this is science, so we have to use our brain. 

I did white chocolate, seasame and original with honey pearls, evaporated milk and maple sugar. I think was pretty good but based on the number of combination, you can get some wacky tasting bubble tea.

I would be back but i dont think I'd be a regular. Too far from me and I like simple."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is completely over hyped. Sure, it's fun to pick your own ingredients and the whole laboratory theme is pretty cool. But in terms of the actual drink you're getting -- mediocre at best.

I made the \"fresh tea\" with mango and lychee syrup and added brown sugar tapioca. The tea itself literally tasted like some average 2010 syrupy artificial bubble tea from tea shop 168. The tapioca was a really weird texture. It wasn't round, it was kinda flattened like an oval shape and oddly firm? It tasted the way tapioca gets when it's a few days old and not fresh anymore. 

Overall I was disappointed by the drink I got. Even though it was a pretty decent cup it wasn't worth $6.50 at all. The bubble tea itself was honestly below average and anyone who hypes this place up clearly doesn't know their bubble tea"}
{"text":"Meh. I knew it was going to be overrated after being heavily featured in online videos, yet I was still slightly disappointed.

First off, the establishment is MUCH smaller than I thought. Not to mention the line to get a bubble tea is a lot longer than typical chains (Chatime, Coco) due to the customization aspect. 

Be careful when picking your flavours. I picked the bare minimum for a fruit juice based drink, and the price came to around $7 after tax. However, the price can easily rack up to $9+ with the more flavours you add. Also, do not get the boba. Not sure if it was supposed to pop in your mouth (which is what I assumed) but it turned out hard and difficult to chew.

I'm glad I went as I wanted to try out this place, but I definitely will not be coming back as it is extremely overhyped."}
{"text":"To be honest, this is the kind of place I'd only go once. The taste is very subpar, and you can literally see the artificial powders and syrups you are putting into your drink. The novelty is pretty cool, and of course after seeing the hype I had to try.

Come for the instagram photos and unique experience. Skip if you enjoy high quality bubble tea drinks."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED this place! What a unique concept. Staff was friendly and helpful. The Bubble Tea tasted awesome. I'd definitely recommend this place and come back again."}
{"text":"Overall cool concept, wide range of flavor selections, but the tapiocas were way to hard/undercooked."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place. The lab theme certainly attracts people fond of sharing novelties on social media (like me). However, I think this shop needs more commitment to the theme.

We were lucky to hit an off-peak hour at around 2pm on a Wednesday, but do expect a bit of a line. When you walk in, you take a cup, pick milk or fruit tea, and select your flavours, all held in vials. You can then add sugar (held in syringes), as well as toppings (stored in petri dishes). This is where the lab theme stops, as you just hand a staff your tray of ingredients and wait for your drink. I assumed that we would be physically making our own bubble tea, or customized lab concoction. For $6-$7 per drink, I would have loved to see this extension of the interactive aspect.

I picked milk tea with honeydew and coconut, as well as 30% sugar and tapioca. The coconut was recommended by one of the attendants, but I don't know how well it meshed with the honeydew. I had heard from friends that their drinks were very sweet, but I think this only applies to the fruit teas. There was a sign recommending evaporated milk with milk teas, so there was an extra 50c added there, making my total to be over $7. 

My boyfriend got a mango/lychee fruit tea with lychee pearls. The cashier seemed to be new, and forgot to charge my boyfriend for his toppings. Right before he paid, another staff caught the error, so his total ended up being $6.50. 

The quality is just below or on-par with other stores such as Chatime. I love the idea, but not sure if it's worth the premium price."}
{"text":"These new bubble tea shops opening up every minute really takes a toll on my bank account. And my health. Nonetheless, I obviously had to try this place out because build-your-own anything is super trendy and when you slap a cute lab theme on it you can be sure I'm on board. 

After a ridiculous amount of time in line (understandable since a certain city's blog made a post about it ), my friends and I got to the flava station. I won't delve too much into the process of creating your drink, but you pay for each ingredient you pick with some certain limits and restrictions.

I combined matcha and raspberry powder for my milk tea and was told twice that it was a risky combination. Little did they know I like living life on the edge. After waiting an hour in line, paying ~$7 for my drink, telling myself \"ignore the haters, you have great taste and this drink is gonna be revolutionary\" and receiving my finished concoction, all I could say was \"WOW! This is bland! I'm disappointed!\" Not a hint of matcha, but that might be because it was overpowered by the not-raspberry raspberry flavour. I did try my friend's and it, too didn't blow my socks off. Would I come back to try another combination? Nah. I really did want to like this place, but there's better quality bubble tea without the gimmicks, so I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Underwhelming to say the least. The line was extremely long and it was a bit confusing at first. I think the menu should better explain the process of what order things are picked out rather than having to wait on an employee to explain. It also would have been nice if they had a list recommended combinations. I ended up getting a mango lychee drink which was yummy, but for the price that I paid - nearly $7 - it was not worth it."}
{"text":"I recently discovered Labothery when visiting Toronto. If you're into bubble tea, then this place was awesome! I love the laboratory concept of creating your own bubble tea drink, where the workers are dressed in lab coats and the ingredients are in petri dishes! 

It definitely was a unique experience, and lived up to the hype!"}
{"text":"RATING (3.5)
Atheistically reallly cute! -- Other wise the wait is too long. Along with waiting in a long slow moving line, there were only 2 people making drinks with a line that almost went out the door.

Taste: it was ok, I didn't have any high expectations but compared to Chatime... not the best. I made a black milk tea and added 66% sugar, I should have added more. I usually only get 30% sugar at Chatime. My friend got a coconut milk tea with the same amount of sugar and it tasted like plain coconut milk. 

Would recommend if you want to go for the experience, if you have a bubble tea craving I suggest you go somewhere else to satisfy it. 

Overall cute (they call you Doctor LOL)"}
{"text":"Went here while in the area and as expected, there was a massive line. To echo what other reviewers have stated, if you would like to experience creating your own bubble tea, then this is the place for you. We went here once to try it out, but would go to other bubble tea places to satisfy our cravings as we felt it was nothing more than a gimmick. 

I decided to create a cold mango and lychee bubble tea with pineapple jelly while my fiancé had a rose and lychee bubble tea with passion fruit jelly. Both teas were good but nothing special. The prices ($6.50 each) for the bubble tea coupled with the wait time and taste is not worth it but it was nice to experience just one time."}
{"text":"Was really stoked when I first heard of this place that you can create your own bubble tea! Since I am avid bubble tea enthusiast and love trying new places this place as was like a god send to finally be able to create your own drink without having to own a franchise or store of your own. 

After reading alot of other reviews I feel like other Yelper's are giving this place some skewed overview on what the actual business concept is suppose to be. Yes, the concept is to create your own concoction of bubble tea anyhow you wish with different kinds of flavors, powders and toppings. However, I feel that others compare this place too harshly to other bubble tea business which are obviously on a different level of taste, quality and authenticity. When people say this place make drinks tastes terrible and not strong enough or whatever, my reply is why can't y'all just enjoy the \"experience\" instead of comparing how your drink isn't up to par with other bubble teas places around the city. If your looking for a \"quality bubble tea\" then best to just go to a Chatime any other chain if you strongly feel this place isn't any good. 

Aside from all that, I actually enjoyed this place and it was pretty fun. I created myself a passion fruit, grape green tea =). The parts in picking and choosing your own flavors was really cool to see all the different flavors in syringes and lab tubes which was pretty unique and creative. The drink it self was a bit sweeter than what I normally have but the taste was there. Could really taste the grape that was mixed in with it as well as the passion fruit. Drink cost was around $5 something so average pricing. I came on a Wednesday and it was still pretty busy nearing 6 pm. Line was a bit long around 15 min wait time. Overall, fun experience and would come again to try other mixtures."}
{"text":"The bespoke bubble tea spot! Wow! I'm so impressed by the concept for one thing. It's definitely a fun way to make your own tea depending on your sweet tooth and what you're craving. They have some limited seating inside, and they have lab jackets to put on for the pic. 

They have so many flavors to choose from and mix and match, from powder to syrup, from different jellies or tapioca balls to popping balls. This place has it all for a fun way to get your bubble tea.

Shoutout to the friendly and very patient staff to explain to each customer how it works, providing suggestions for the best tasting outcome, or even just making you feel welcome. I love this place!"}
{"text":"This new spin on bubble tea is definitely interesting! Where it falls short is the speedy service on a line up that extends all around the walls to the entrance door of the shop. Having said that, Labothery is still an experience you want to try out at least once!

Syringes are for tea while Test Tubes are for milk tea. Prices may be a bit too much than the normal bubble tea standards but you are trading price for novelty experience + various flavour profiles + something new!

Overall, I recommend coming here with a friend or group. Don't come alone because you'll be the odd one out."}
{"text":"This bubble tea place is really cute and innovative. I saw the syringes and test tubes online and of course I fell in love and decided to venture in here, but it's really just all hype. 

We came on a weekday afternoon, and there was no lineup, so we could take our time deciding what to pick. The staff is pretty helpful in the choosing process so that we wouldn't end up with a terrible combination. The whole place is themed, which I love! Even the tables were the type used in examinations. 

We both picked fruity, cold drinks. So I did a double syringe of rose syrup (cold drinks required 2 syringes), green tea base, and picked up lychee boba, and it cost $6.50... which is really expensive for a rather generic bubble tea order. The drink tasted okay too, nothing special, and would have been acceptable if it was under $5 like CoCo or the Alley. 

You really just come here for the experience of mixing your bubble tea. I would say it's fun to come in once, but I wouldn't make it my go-to bbt joint."}
{"text":"Since it seemed like such a fun idea, we really wanted to like this, but it wasn't the innovative experience we wanted it to be. It wasn't straight forward enough how the customer was suppose to choose their drink combinations and how things were priced. The instructions on the wall conflicted with what the cashier/mixer later recommended in terms of how much syrup to use. As for pricing, it turned out that you started with an empty cup at $3.25 and everything else you added costed extra. It can get pretty expensive, like $15, for just a simple drink. Note that the petri dishes they use for ingredients were unsealed. Once you've chosen everything they squirt and pour everything together for you. The premium is due to the fact that they have to pay the staff to clean and put everything into syringes and petri dishes... so once you've realized that and get over the gimmick, the traditional bubble tea model wins with the better efficiency, taste, and at half the pricing. Also, they likely forgot to use green tea to make my drink as there wasn't any hint of it in my guava lychee green tea with aloe!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the places you try for the experience. They really stay true to the theme, all the way down to the part where they stick the title of Dr. in front of your name on the cup. There are some fun to be had with that. 

The base price of the drink seems reasonable, but all the syrups/flavors/toppings come at an additional cost and final result is a pretty expensive drink. My drink got a pass, but my friends drink were modified after the store employee strongly recommended additional milk and additional flavour powders to my friends. They both went with the milk tea based drinks and felt the flavors were not strong enough.

I tried the yogurt pearl in my fresh tea drink, but it was very underwhelming, especially in combination with the tapioca. The tapioca were on the hard side, probably because it's been sitting in a dish for a while, while the pearls popped very easily so it just felt like more liquid with no additional texture."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Labothery after someone in my Yelp Facebook group let us in on the secret about this place.  It looks like they recently launched and they offer your typical powder and syrup bubble tea, but everything is made to look like you are picking samples from a scientist's laboratory.  The staff are dressed in white lab coats and it looks like they are mixing secret chemicals together to concoct your drink.

The lab is quite spacious with barstool type seating.  Upon entering you are supposed to pick up a small metal tray and start by deciding whether you want a cold or hot drink.  Then you pick different ingredients, which are packaged in little tubes or syringes for your drink.

I found that the staff were not so helpful in making recommendations for the drinks and as this place gets busier, I can see that it will be difficult to ensure that the line-ups of indecisive but intrigued customers can be moved quickly.  Instructions on what can be picked are uncleared and it's only when we got to the counter that they told us that some of the ingredients chosen would not go well together.  All of the flavours are quite standard.  They have tapioca and bobas in little petri dishes.  Oh yeah, and the milk toppings are in pee cups... yup the pee cups that doctors give you to pee in.  Good laugh at that one!"}
{"text":"I am truly a bubble tea fanatic and this place merely met my standards. The concept of building your own bubble tea in a science lab is very intriguing and I felt a strong urge to stop by here and make a unique drink. 

The employee recommended 2 flavour vials plus an \"original\" vial for a more milky taste. However, I found that my drink was waaaayy too powdery and left my mouth dry after each sip. I blended white chocolate, matcha and original together, totalling $7.65 but I could not even finish half of the drink. Moreover, there is not enough tapioca to sustain the entirety of the drink and you will often get sips of the bubble tea without any toppings. 

Other than that, the location is very close to Eaton Centre making it very accessible and the decorations were very welcoming.

If I were to come back, I would recommend getting a fruit tea, not adding original into the milk tea and try to stray away from insane combinations."}
{"text":"I was drawn in by Labothéry's Instagram fame. I found the boba shop through some digging on the app and was enticed by its concept. It seemed cute, nerdy, and tasty so I decided to give it a try.

The layout of the restaurant is very minimal, a corner in which the lab techs make the boba, another corner in which the bathrooms and balloon decor lies, and a side of tables. There's a very large, underutilized space between the door and the ordering corner. 

I waited in line for maybe 15-20 minutes before getting to the counter. The girl at the tubes and syringes station was very helpful in suggesting what flavors to chose when customizing your boba experience. I went with pomegranate and mango under her suggestion. The milk teas were in powdered form in test tubes while the regular teas were syrup flavors in syringes. I picked up two syringes. Since we did not get milk tea, we did not need to select how much sugar we needed. However this was probably my favorite part of the line up, being aware of how much sugar you're putting into your drink. Further down the line there were Petri dishes with different boba flavors or jelly additives. There was tapioca on the side, as always.

When we finally reached checkout, we were surprised at how much everything added up. $3.25 for the base $1 for every syringe or test tube and $.50 for each topping. Our total came out to be $6.20, a large price for a novelty experience. Oh well, they wrote my name as Dr._____ on my cup and called it out about 15 minutes later.

After all that waiting, I picked up my cup eager to see what my drink would taste like. And it was disappointing. Nothing too special about the flavors or toppings, nothing to rave about except how cool the syringes and test tube stand looked in a photo. Well played, Labothéry. Overall, I won't be returning for the bubble tea, but it was definitely an Instagram worthy experience."}
{"text":"I went in expecting an interesting experience, with test tubes and syringes. Seemed kind of a cool idea.
But the biggest drawback was the slow service. Making bubble tea which is a simple process took ridiculously long.

In their desire to make it cool, they compromised on the speed of service. Which ended up ruining the whole experience.

The taste was also pretty average."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea store experience but worst bubble tea I've ever had. But I did appreciate the concept and thoroughness in staying true to the lab theme.

I got a milk tea and chose white chocolate and red bean powder bases. The white chocolate flavour was subtle and I couldn't taste the red bean at all. I also added brown sugar tapioca and it had a weird hard jelly texture. I felt like it took pretty long for them to blend up my creation and the drink was a disappointment after the fun and hype of it all.

Or maybe their bubble tea is fine and I'm just a really sucky bubble tea scientist."}
{"text":"Fun experience and cool to get to make and customize your own bubble tea drinks! The line up was long and things took long to make. Lots of assortment of flavours and variety! Price is a bit high, compared to other bubble tea places."}
{"text":"An absolutely cool crossover of bubble tea and a science lab!

Located at NE corner of Bay Street / Gerrard Street West, Labothéry is a laboratory-themed tea café where YOU are in control of what goes into your bubble tea drink!

Labothéry does not have a menu, so you can create your own concoction with a wide selection of flavours and toppings. The options are truly endless! So \"get ready to unleash your inner chemist\" :D

The coolest part of the experience was picking out the ingredients, where they are packaged in the forms of test tubes, syringes, petri dishes! Gets me all excited lol.

The 'lab scientists' working there were very friendly and will give you advice on which flavours or toppings would go well together in your drink. 

You can create your own milk tea, fresh tea or slush once you have your base flavours, sweetness level, and toppings in your tray. The 'lab' barista will 'mix' them together, and will address you by Dr. (insert your name here) when your drink is ready ^^

I instantly fell in love with my creation! I made a cold drink (there is only one size for cups) with Guava and Lychee syrup, green tea, no extra added sugar, plus aloe and tapioca!

My partner made an ambitious hot creation with banana powder, black tea, 10ml sugar, evaporated milk, and tapioca lol. That was a fun mix ^^ It turns out not that bad actually, but maybe just needs another syringe of sugar OR perhaps another test tube of white chocolate would definitely do the trick! #innerchemistcomesout lol

Congratulations again on your Grand Opening yesterday! Thank you so much for the VIP card and starting me on the stamp card. Keep up the great work :) I will be back to DIY more creations!"}
{"text":"Four stars instead of five because the line is ridiculous. They should have more than one cashier to speed up the line. Also because my drink came out to $8.20. You start out at 3.25 & it builds with whatever u add including flavors; 3.25 is what I pay for regular bubble tea as is, the base shouldn't be that expensive. ALSO, if you do a milk tea THEY FORCE YOU TO BUT EVAP MILK. WHY WOULDNT THAT JUST COME WITH IT IF ITA NECESSARY??! Stupid...
This concept of being able to mix your own bubble tea is amazing, so smart making it interactive. I mixed taro and white chocolate. It was amazing. The variety of different boba is amazing. The honey and tapioca go very well together. I wouldn't come back here though, way too expensive."}
{"text":"Kind of gimmicky and definitely over priced, but it's definitely a must visit at least once. This is the kind of place that I would take visitors to Toronto, just because the concept of being a \"Lab\" and having test tubes and such is a pretty unique way of serving bubble tea. 

While initially there seems to be a lot of choices to mix different flavors together, realistically, not many flavors do taste well together, so that limits your choices (Apparently Durian doesn't mix well with anything!!). I think it's fun but not really worth it and doesn't top other Toronto bubble tea spots."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend because we were both interested in the build your own drink concept. The interior is certainly very fun, and it's nice to look at all the Petri dishes and lab tubes. However, the drink itself is not tasty, and extremely expensive to boot. I got the black sesame + matcha powder (their recommendation) with honey popping bobba, and the overall quality was just off. 

The owner and employees however seem extremely friendly. I was very indecisive and the owner pqtiently made several suggestions. It's a fun concept, but at the end of the day I'm here for high quality, good tasting bubble tea, which is why I'll go to any of the nearby Gong Cha or Coco or Chatime.

If you're still intrigued by the lab coats and atmosphere, try it once, just keep your expectations low and watch out with all the pricey combos!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of the whole Labothèry thing. The people working there pretend to be scientists by wearing white coats. It's self service which is fun. U can choose ur own ingredients by taking a flavoured powdeeed injection or a test tube and then mix in ur fav sweeter and ur choice of diary. Even though it was fun making my own drink I feel it was highly expensive for a casual bubble tea place. I know places that sell bubble tea for just 4$. And I paid extra for soy milk cuz I wanted my drink to be creamier but it was still very watery. The taste wasn't as rich as other places I know. The process is fun but the drink... not so much."}
{"text":"finally had the chance to come try this place out after all the hype. very impressed with my drink (lychee peach green tea with strawberry and lychee pearls) the price was around $7 i believe. there are many flavours to choose from and you can get either milk tea or regular tea or slush. the flavours are very accurate so you should be careful with the flavours you choose as some combinations might taste a little weird. there are a lot of toppings to choose from but for the pearl and boba, they are different. pearl is the ones that pop juices into your mouth and boba is the chewy tapioca. the place is also pretty big with wifi haha. i came around 5:45 on a friday night and it wasn't that busy. the workers are also super nice and helped us out with ordering. i would come back to try other flavour combinations since you probably can't get some combinations else where."}
{"text":"Interesting new concept for bubble tea. I am not a huge bubble tea lover but I wanted to give it a shot. It was fun to go once but probably won't be back. I went a few days after they opened so it was still fairly new and the workers were getting the hang of chatting with their customers and helping them out. It was a bit intimidating not knowing what to do at first but the staff helped us out. 

It would be really great if they had some sample menus or a recommendation list for those who don't really know what they want. 

Great interior concept with the whole lab theme. Good seating area too!"}
{"text":"Having seen this on blogto, I was eager to try it out. 

I came on a Sunday afternoon and there was a minimal crowd. I think the hype for this place really died down because I remember there being large crowds before. Anywho the staff were quite friendly and walked me through the process of crafting my bubble tea. 

You choose up to 2 syringes ($1 each), as many toppings as you want ($0.50 each), and a base tea ($3.5-4). The theme is really unique in a sense that it is a lab complete with the syringes and Petri dishes for toppings. They also call your name as \"Dr. (Insert your name)\" when your order is ready. 

I decided on grapefruit and rose as my base syrups, with honey boba for toppings (honey filled gels) and green tea base. The drink was light and refreshing, but didn't taste any more different than other bubble tea places. 

The drink also took some time to make as the queue in line does build up as they explain to customers what to do. Also, there's not too much seating (all the 4 tables were taken when I went). 

It's definitely a cool spot to experience, so try it out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Labothery was so aggressively average that I didn't even sit down after I got my drink.

It is definitely an IG hype and is pretty cute.  The idea is that you go into the \"lab\" and create your own drink.  They have everything in test tubes and little petri dishes.  
1. You choose hot/cold
2. You choose milk tea or fruit flavored - which you grab by the tubes (powder or syrup)
3. You choose your sweetness
4. You choose your toppings

Each of these add up and you get your total at the end.  Your name will be called \"Dr. Lo\" when your drink is ready.

Concept is pretty novel and the workers were working as hard as they can but omg the line was so long and the bubbletea was so average.

It's a novelty thing which I'm glad I tried out but won't come again."}
{"text":"Super weird taste, great ideas for selling their milk tea, but it tastes really awful. Not recommended."}
{"text":"What's unique experience! It can be a little overwhelming with how crazy busy this place is and if you've never had bubble tea (like me) the entire time in line I was trying to do research on flavors and kinds. 

I ended up with a fresh brewed tea and used pomegranate and lychee flavors with lychee boba. It was delicious but I typically do unsweetened teas and this was over the top sweet. Still the flavors were very good. 

If I could I would have done a milk tea where I could control a bit of the sweetness more. 

The directions are straight forward so that's nice and there's someone at each station to answer questions so it did help a lot. 

This is a very unique and pretty inexpensive experience if you're in Toronto and are wanting to try bubble tea with a complete experience this is the place to go. 

Be prepared to wait because I never saw this place without a line out the door."}
{"text":"Yes, I bought the gimmick. How can I not? Picked the safest flavours I could. I didnt find the durian flavor or I would have totally gone for that. Its a cute concept but definitely too pricey to be a regular hangout spot. 

I think this was a one and done kind of deal. Its pretty cool but too expensive. You should def try thia place if you havent already."}
{"text":"Don't know why I can't choose one flavor powder and one original powder, if you choose the original one if have to be the extra powder, but two flavor one is way too heavy and sweet, taste bad"}
{"text":"Although the theme of the place is cute, underneath all of the lab decorations it is just a regular boba shop. The drinks and flavors were all very good but the wait time was simply too long for my liking. However, all the staff were really friendly and even gave me reccomendations for different flavors! I would reccomend if You are into bubble tea but I wouldn't expect anything out of this world."}
{"text":"This place was so busy! This is a brilliant idea that lets the consumer create their drink! Great idea, great place, great product. It's awesome."}
{"text":"Labothery is the latest  hot spot for slush and bubble tea. The name says it all and the experience is a  pleasant surprise. What I will say is you can customize your bubble teas any way you want. Use your discretion when customizing as too many flavours or too many non matching  will ruin the overall taste.  Currently I am trying out the  slushes and bubble teas with the rose flavoured paired with other matching flavours. Some of these are rose and lychee w lychee pearls. Rose and  passion fruit   with passion fruit pearls and jellies.  The slushes taste really good and  are quite eye pleasing .The options are limitless. Think before you order and all will be well."}
{"text":"There's a plethora of bbt places in the downtown core, but obviously what sets this place apart is the ability to customize. No, i'm not talking about % of sugar, or % of ice you can add, but your entire drink. You can mix flavors you would not be able to do so at another franchise, and add as many toppings as you'd like (from what they offer). The science lab theme of this place is also unique and makes it really cute. As a science graduate myself, the syringes, petri dishes, test tubes, sample jars etc was funny to me, but I'm sure it adds to the experience for others. 
You start off with a sterile tray, picking either a hot/cold cup for your drink. They also instruct you on how many test tube (of tea flavors) to add to your drink (2x for cold drinks, 1x for hot). You move on to a slew of test tube tray racks, where you can choose which tea flavor you'd like. The choices range from fruity flavors (peach etc) to milk tea powders (durian, red bean etc). You can also choose your level of sweetness with various types of sugar too (regular sugar syrup, brown sugar etc). Around the corner, you'll get to choose your toppings (boba - the ones that explode in your mouth, pearls - what they described as harder than tapoica, jelly etc) in petri dishes. They also have evaporated milk as an option, which they recommended based off your customized drink to enhance the flavor and add some creaminess. 
Finally, when you get to the register, you have an option of a 3 different tea bases. I found it a cute touch how each of the cups have \"DR.\" printed on them, where they write your name on it (so they call you as \"DR. _____\"). 

My friends and I all chose a milk tea, which we all agreed was not as spectacular as we would have expected. However, I've heard that their customized fruity teas are really enjoyable, so I'm looking forward to going back and giving those a try. I usually get a small size at any bbt place I go to, but unfortunately at this place they only offer 1 size."}
{"text":"Super cool concept and layout. The bubble tea wasn't that special, but the experience of customizing it was great. The staff was really accommodating and provided helpful suggestions. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went last night to check it out and the line was quite long. Waited 30 min before I got my drink. It's a little expensive for bubbletea but the flavours were good and the experience/ decor is interesting 
It's $3.25 for a cup, $1/flavour, $0.50/topping and you get a choice of oolong, black and green tea.

One thing I didn't like was customer service. They were quite slow with the drinks and the cashier made me second guess my order. I get she was trying to help but asking \"are you sure you want this?\" Right before I pay is not helpful.

Flavours were pretty good but don't think I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool.  You get to choose the base for your drink, and all the little details that go into making bubble tea.  To be quiet honest, the line wasn't totally worth the wait.  I mean I did want to try something new, the options were a little intimidating because well what do I  know about mixing flavors for drinks.

Maybe I'm just boring, but I'd rather just go to a regular bubble tea place and pick a flavor from the menu.

It was an experience.  I'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"SUPER FUN EXPERIENCE ! I kept my creation pretty tame at a Rose Lychee Green tea with Aloe vera. Overall, the flavours came through and it tasted nice.

//THE ATMOSPHERE//
Labothéry uses the concept of being your own 'scientist' and formulating your own drink. There's a wall with instructions as well as an employee behind the test tube flavour rack who will help you along your bubble tea making adventure :) 

I loved all the details since it really made you feel like you're in a laboratory! From the lab bench-like tables, toppings in Petri dishes, test tubes, lab coat wearing employees, and they even call you 'Dr. [insert name]'! 

//OVERALL THOUGHTS//
It can get very expensive depending on the amount of add-ons and flavours you put in. But I'd say it's worth it to check out at least once just to get this unique science-meets-bubble tea experience!"}
{"text":"Labothery manages to provide a plethora of choices in a way that doesn't overwhelm you. You only have two base choices: milk or tea (green, black, or oolong). I ordered a black tea based drink (since I am lactose intolerant), with rose and lychee syrups.

Pros: 1) I love their dedication to the science theme! When they call your name they will add \"doctor\" to the beginning. 2) They have a person (in a lab coat) specially dedicated to helping you with their unique process. 3) There's also a variety of cool flavours (wintermelon, durian, grape, kumquat). 

Cons: 1) You can't change the sugar level for tea drinks (but you can for milk drinks). The flavored syrups are already infused with sugar, and it was too sweet for my taste. 2) I added tapioca pearls (for $1.50) and my drink was $6.50, which is pricey... 3) I waited 20 min in line, maybe there should be 2 checkouts? 4) there are no lactose free milk tea base options, since the powders are already mixed with milk powder.  

It was fun to try out but I'm not sure if I'll be back since my lactose intolerance limits me to tea based drinks, and the syrups are too sweet."}
{"text":"OMG!!! LOVE THIS PLACE. Huge line up but I don't even care, it's hype for a reason. So cute, love everything about it, even comes with a stamp card. Workers are so sweet and cute too, very helpful!

I'm living for everything about this place. Definitely will be taking everyone I know here.

(tbh it's kinda overpriced $8 for like a medium.. but the concept of it DEFINTELY makes up for it!) Obsessed.

The whole aes is so cute. The lab coats, the balloon photo area, the chalk board. LOVE."}
{"text":"Innovative idea and great tasty drinks.  The prices are fair too.  My go to drink is Mango green tea with mango jelly."}
