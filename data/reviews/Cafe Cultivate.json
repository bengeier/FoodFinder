{"text":"Not sure what cafe could hold a candle to Cafe Cultivate. The food is organic, portion sizes were great, coffee is local, and the owners are extremely friendly and caring of those who visit. They have teas, coffee, and lemonade as well as tasty grab and go delights. My favorite was the smoked clubber and the vegan honey mustard wrap. You must try there spicy-sweet pickles. They are delightful and addictive. My favorite drink was the iced dirty chi latte. The environment is full of hospitality and great smells. Stop in sometime. You surely won't be disappointed in doing so."}
{"text":"As my wife and I walked out of our gym after a midday workout, I saw a sign on the curb across the driveway that Cafe Cultivate, \"Is now open.\" So, being a bit hungry, we walked over to check it out. The place had been open one week!   Before we walked in, we noticed three tall poles on the quiet outdoor patio with herbs and greens growing out of them. We were warmly greeted by co-owner Gregory Bryan who told us his wife, Chef Juli Bryan, uses the fresh-grown produce in the food she and her staff prepare in the kitchen. Impressive!   We ordered the Smoked Clubber made from mesquite smoked turkey, Black Forest ham, extra crispy bacon, tomato, red onion, greens, Vermont yellow cheddar, and a perfect Mediterra Farm bread. The sandwich came with a chef-made cookie, the kind of bonus we love!   The sandwich was really special, one of the best tasting club sandwiches in memory. Since we split this fine creation, we got an extra bonus cookie, one on each of our plates! That's generosity we love!   Cafe Create is located in the Ability 360 complex at 5031 E Washington Street in Phoenix. The modern complex is only about six years old, with ample and free parking right across the driveway from the cafe. After your cafe visit, check out Ability 360, one of the most extraordinary places of its kind in the U. S.   Try Cafe Create with its full coffee bar, enticing breakfast and lunch menus, and impressive-looking options for catering services. You'll be as delighted as we were!  We're looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and delicious food, combined with a great Café mission and values makes it easy to get behind Café Cultivate. Gregory and Julie are two of the nicest people you'll meet and are very passionate about everything they do which shows from the moment you walk in to Café Cultivate."}
{"text":"Haven't found a better coffee shop to study than this place! Since they serve some of the best food I've ever had at a cafe I'm able to stay for a long time and actually get some work done without having to leave to get something to eat. Staff is pretty awesome and super welcoming, they don't mind me hanging out for hours almost everyday! Food is really good and I know they use natural ingredients, even grow most of their own greens out on the patio. Would recommend this place to anyone no matter the occasion!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for healthy food that tastes great, look no further.  The cafe is located in the Ability 360 building, so don't be surprised if you don't spot them from the street.  Everything is fresh and natural.  Service is outstanding.  Prices are a bit high, but worth it if natural foods appeal to you."}
{"text":"I typically work from home but on Tuesdays, I make the trek into the office. It used to be tough but now, since Cafe Cultivate opened on the first floor, I know my lunch will be delish and the service will be outstanding. Sometimes I can even motivate myself to get to work on time just by thinking about the yummy breakfast burritos. I honestly cannot say enough wonderful things about this place. Greg & Julie are so friendly accommodating and inclusive. Now that they've added the sweet-spicy pickIes as a side, I may need to come into the office more frequently..."}
{"text":"Every time I got to this cafe, I get the caramel latte with extra shots of espresso. It is the best latte with amazing caramel flavor I have ever tasted. My taste buds were exploding with love. I love holding my meetings there, for the coffee. I always look at the menu and all the food items always sound so good. I shall get something to eat next time!!!   Of course I'll be back time and time again."}

{"text":"Cafe Cultivate is absolutely delicious! If you're looking for something fresh, healthy, and tasty, this is the place. As a vegetarian, I always seem to have issues with finding filling food that isn't just carbs, but this place serves no issue for me in that matter. It actually feels and tastes like you're eating fresh real, food without any additives you normally have these days. The coffee bar has an excellent variety of specialty drinks that you can go no wrong in ordering. Even better - the owners, Gregory and Juli are such warm and inviting people. Definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"This is already my favorite lunch spot! I'll be trying EVERYTHING on the menu, but may have a hard time picking my favorite...oh well, the struggle is real and well worth it.  Nice job, Gregory and Julie... especially like the posts on the wall. Comfy vibe and a real nice feel to hang out and just chill."}
