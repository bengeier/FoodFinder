{"text":"Great place to go for vegan. A lovely special lady friend and I went to Pero on the weekend in search of animal-free sustenance. Neither of us had ever had Ethiopian food, but our waiter (who we believe was actually the proprietor) took pains to explain each dish to us. He recommended that we order the vegetarian platter, which is fully vegan, not to mention delicious.   Excellent food, interesting surroundings (numerous intriguing paintings and prints, as well as unique artifacts and tables) and wonderful service all mean that we'll definitely be back. Thank you Pero for a great night!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Pero with my mother and we were very impressed. The atmosphere and the decor were lovely and the service was excellent! I am a big fan of Ethiopian food and  have tried both Nazareth and Lalibela in Toronto. I found the quality of the food at Pero to be superior to both those restaurants. I would strongly recommend trying Pero, especially for those unfamiliar with Ethiopian cuisine.  I only have two concerns to note about the restaurant. The first was that some of the dishes were only lukewarm. The second was the price. I am a regular at a number of Ethiopian restaurants in Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto and I found the price point at Pero to be quite high in comparison. I also was not impressed that I was charged extra for additional injera as it is required to eat the meal and not enough was served with the dish.   Altogether, the food and service were excellent but the price, had we not had a Living Social deal, was excessive."}
{"text":"Really impressed by their service! Our waitress was extremely attentive and approachable. When we asked how it was best to order for a table of 6, she made excellent suggestions. The food was really good, not oily, good variety. Injera extremely fresh and they quickly brought out more when asked. Plenty of water and napkins and a hand bath after the meal. The food is well priced for the type of establishment about $15 per person + tax and tip. Drinks are on the expensive side but only when compared to other Ethiopian restaurants, otherwise it's the going rate for Toronto. Decor was lovely and the establishment very clean. Would definitely recommend for large groups and/or first-timers. Go with Lailibela groupon or Nazareth if you're going to eat Ethiopian weekly but go to Pero for a \"nicer\" date or large group dinner experience. If you're big eaters (I.e all guys), order an extra dish for every 3 people and you'll be well stuffed."}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon for this restaurant and was very glad we did. This is a wonderful restaurant with very friendly staff and great food! Restaurant is tastefully decorated creating a nice quiet and relaxing atmosphere to enjoy great Ethiopian food. I will definitely go back there again.  There is a great little tent in the back that would accommodate about 8 people. If you love Ethiopian food or are curious about Ethiopian food I would strongly recommend Pero."}
{"text":"Fantastic set up with very nice decoration. Quite and lovely place. Food is mind blowing and Pero himself is very friendly and respectful and greets every customer whenever he is there. I come to this restaurant all the way from Hamilton and Brampton. 100% recommended."}
{"text":"I was looking for a late night place(11pm-ish) to grab a bite and stumbled across this little gem. This place had a sexy ambiance, low lights, red walls, candles, great photography on the wall, live music AND a fully stocked bar (SCORE!).  The vibe was chilled out and most people seemed to be leaning back and enjoying their drinks and the music. We ordered a mixed combination platter of 3 vegetarian dishes, the beef tibs and another spicy lamb curry.    The food came out in the perfect amount of time to allow for some good conversation. The yellow lentils were smooth and went really well with the injera. The green/brown lentils were a little bland in comparison, and I wasn't a fan of the texture. The beef tibs were a bit more sour from other places I have tried it in and were SUPERB. The lamb curry was quite similar to the tibs, and spicier but not overwhelmingly so and was my favourite.The injera(crepe-like spongey flatbread) is served cold not warm as opposed to other places, but I didnt mind that.   I found myself stuffing my face with the delicious curry-soaked injera on the platter that it was served on, after polishing off everything else. Also, the servers were attentive and helpful and spoke english fluently. Always a plus!  Another thing which I liked about this place was the crowd was quite mixed and not just \"i-am-here-for-my-first-ethiopean-experience\". Also, people were enjoying drinks, not coffee service which at most other restaurant comes coupled with a rather headache-inducing incense, and was a welcome relief from the reason that keeps me from having Ethiopean less often.  This is definitely my favourite Ethiopean place in the city, and quickly becoming my go-to spot for a more intimate dinner with a date(leaning in over the live music definitely adds to the more \"date-y\" experience) or to catch up with a friend or two.   Prices are around $30 for the combination platter, enough to feed 3-4 people. Great music is free (atleast on the Sunday night that I happened to be there)"}
{"text":"Why oh why is this place rated so high!? Probably by people that don't eat Ethiopian food often.   I've had Ethiopian food in most of the city, east ... west, and south + other cities in Canada and the US. This place has by far been one of the worst places. Here is why:  There are a ton of better places in the neighbourhood. The food we ordered was bland, and chunky. The beef and chicken (how my partner described it) was chewy and old. The veggie choices were sub-par, and nothing special.   The mint tea was not a tea at all ... it was 2 leaves of mint submersed in medium-hot water, which didn't do anything, because it wasn't crushed, and had no actual tea leaves. So really it was a tasteless mint infusion (yes, I am a big fan of teas/infusions and this was sinful + expensive).   One other comment: I found beef in my veggie dishes. Yes, imagine if you are a vegetarian, and order a shared platter (I asked if the items were separated so that I wasn't forced to eat meat, was told absolutely), then as I was eating my lentils, I picked up a piece of beef. No, it wasn't put there by me or my partner, it was there when the platter arrived.   SO, save yourself the trip, and try a different place. The chef came up and said hi to us, which was nice, but it by far did not help the food aspect."}
{"text":"Pero Lounge is a family restaurant and elegant lounge combined in one. The food is delicious and hospitality exceptional. Pero, the owner, is very warm and attentive to his customers and detail.   One of his top dishes \"Chiro\" is authentically prepared by a chef from a tribal region of Eritrea with the perfect combination of spices and ingredients. Calamari, an off-menu item available on request, is generously flavoured in a pungunt tomato-spicy gravy. The aromatic house-brewed coffee is freshly roasted and served in a beautiful Eritrean pot.   Lovely Eritrean pottery and art decorate the dim- and candle-lit restaurant. At night the lounge comes alive with live music. The basement has a stage and may be booked for occasions and special functions.   You must check it out yourself to experience the true flavour of Pero Lounge!"}
{"text":"I found a groupon for this restaurant a while back and decided to get it because I have never had Ethiopian food before and I am glad I did it. My date and I enjoyed eating the tasty food here. The staff were also very helpful explaining and suggesting dishes for us to pick. The waitress even taught us a bit about the Ethiopian eating culture when asked and my date and I had a lot of fun feeding each other by hand. The environment in the restaurant also isn't so loud that we have to yell to hear each other and could just talk normally, which is nice. Overall this place is alright to visit."}
{"text":"I went there for birthday and it is very exciting as this is my first time having African food. Service is good and bartender treated me a birthday shot. We got a booth at the back of the restaurant, which is very comfortable. However, they do charge $20 for bringing in birthday cakes, which I find a little bit expensive. Food is not too spicy, and price is acceptable. Overall, we all had a good time and very interesting experience."}
{"text":"Great food, ambient, quiet atmosphere.  I enjoyed my grilled Lamb Cha Cha.  It is a bit chewy, however that's how I preferred it rather than the fatty juice normally I would have had it in most the restaurant.  The vegetables with the dish are very flavourful.  Before the meals started, there was a coffee ceremony to awaken our senses.This was my first time trying Ethiopian cuisine, it was quite a pleasant experience with a very hospitality owner who often came by our table greeting us.   We were there as a group of six, he also accommodated us in a VIP tent seating.  However, I would like to use utensils in the next visit and I would hope they would reselect their beer choices on the menu, since Canadian really love Beer and I like mine dark or Red,  With Yelp Check In 10%."}
{"text":"with its dim lighting and immersive decor, Pero is definitely a date spot. and since last night was Thursday and we had a Groupon, it became OUR date spot.  although ours is not a Nazareth household - lining up with a bunch of clueless hipsters for mediocre food is not our bag - we eat Ethiopian about twice a month, generally at Lalibela or African Place. we've now visited all the restaurants on the Bloor St W strip.   so trust when I say that the food here is fresher, and more creative, and more varied than any of the other Ethiopian places in the neighborhood.   it's also about four times the price.  the decor is fancier, there are two cool party tent areas for groups at the front and back, there's live music, there's lovely scented water for handwashing, and the service is outstanding. the owner Mr Pero himself was very gracious and informative about the food, assuming that we were unfamiliar, and suggested an interesting appetizer that we were glad we tried.   so you are getting something extra for your money.  however that extra is quality, not quantity. the veggie combo is about half the size of the same dish at any other restaurant we've visited. there was a mushroom version of tibs which was cool. the presentation was lovely. but if I hadn't had a Groupon I probably wouldn't have gone in. there is just too much good cheap food around this 'hood to spring for less for more, if you follow my meaning.  IMPORTANT NOTE: while many Ethiopian restaurants advertise that their injera is gluten-free, Mr Pero was kind enough to inform us (after we'd cleaned our plates) that his is only 70% gluten free. so if this is an issue for you, be aware."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this gem of a restaurant.   I was introduced to Pero at a Friend's birthday party and have been back many times. I have recently turned Vegan and love that I can still enjoy MANY delicious items on their menu.   The owner is super nice and makes sure that his guests are well taken care of and happy. The ambiance and price point are perfect for a great night out.   I always leave WAY too full because the food is so amazing so if you're going out after, maybe take it light (if you can contain yourself).  Thank you Pero for being so awesome. xo"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The staff was super friendly we got the peros platter and the owner gave 6 vegetable dishes instead of 3 plus chicken and beef. So so delicious and huge portions we just loved it! And our friend who is vegan also had a vegetarian platter she enjoyed her food too. Would definitely come back. Such good food and great staff!!!"}
{"text":"We had an Amazing experience at Pero's. It was a cozy, warm atmosphere with authentic food. Peri actually came to our table to recommend food, discuss eating etiquette and welcoming us. He added a little extra to our combo platter. I highly recommend Pero's for an authentic Ethiopian experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"Nous devons y retourner car pour l'instant nous n'avons pu y déguster que quelques petites amuses-gueules lors d'une excellente soirée privée. Piqué par la curiosité, le rendez-vous est pris : donc à bientôt !"}
{"text":"Amazing Ethiopian food! Probably the best Ethiopian I've had. Great atmosphere and very attentive waitstaff."}
{"text":"I've been to Pero twice and both times were delicious except the second time, my friends and I got severe food poisoning. It incapacitated all of us and one of us even had to go to the doctor :(. Wish I had better news and hopefully they deal with this ASAP."}
{"text":"Dinner   Ambience: 3.5/5   Food: 3/5  Service: 3/5 (Friendly) Value: 3/5  Repeat: Nope."}
{"text":"Went here on groupon with our friends. My boyfriend and I got the meat platter for two and our friends got the veggie platter (which was also vegan). Food is delicious and unique. The bread is a bit sour and very soft, I loved the flavour. The platter is huge and we could not finish it all. We also got drinks (caesars and other cocktails) which were average. Don't recommend ordering spicy drinks with this food, it's on the spicy side for sure! If you like to try new food, this is the place to go. Ethiopian food is amazing! Will be back very soon!  Update: went in for the second time and this time we also got the coffee. Oh my goodness!! It was the best coffee I have had in my life! And only for $6! While she was preparing the coffee the waitress brought us the roasted sizzling coffee beans which smelled amazing! It is served in a traditional metal container which conserves heat.  They serve popcorn with the coffee which go surprisingly well together."}
{"text":"Pero is a lovely, romantic little thing that I hesitate to describe as a \"restaurant and lounge\"... the restaurant thing, my taste buds attest, they've got down, and there is definitely a vibe befitting late night drinks in their cozy setting (complete with drapes, dim lighting, and ambient music)... but my picture of lounges involves overpriced cocktails and a nightclub feel, whereas Pero lies somewhere between a jazz cafe and an intimate resto for cute couples (made cute simply by the fact that they are in this setting).  My friend and I shared a veg platter and a nice bottle of African shiraz. The food was flavourful and very tasty, and, me being a messy and enthusiastic eater, I loved the way it's all to be eaten Ethiopian-style, sans cutlery, with your bare hands (the owner even told me flatteringly that I eat like I've been to Africa! Messy eaters rejoice!). Super cute feature: they give you a bowl of lemon water with actual rose petals after the meal to wash your hands. D'aw.  Prices are quite reasonable (~$30 can feed two people, and wine bottles start at ~$30 also), and the service is super sweet. And I hear they've opened the downstairs for live music, which I'm quite excited for based on their taste (in decor and in music). Of note, they are 100% veg*n-friendly, but also equally carnivore-friendly.   Overall, there really wasn't one aspect that I felt was wanting - 4 stars for the food, and the added star for the amazing ambiance and lovely service. I will definitely be back, perhaps on a night with live music (Fri-Sun)."}
{"text":"Simply put, delicious! We came with a Groupon with our toddler, and even though he was screaming a bit, the staff there were very accommodating.  It also helped that we were there before 6pm on a Saturday, so we were the only ones there at the time.  The service was good, and the food was as well.  We had the Pero's platter for two, and my favourite was the beef.  The lentils were a bit too spicy for my wife, and was on my upper range as well.  Decor is nice & cultural, with some soft relaxing music in the background.  My wife kept saying that she's looking forward to coming back, and I am as well!"}
{"text":"I visited Pero's with a Groupon on a weekday night dinner around 5:30pm. The restaurant was completely empty except for us, which worried me slightly but I didn't think too much into it.  We ordered the Pero's Platter which comes with 2 meat dishes and 3 veggie dishes. The base includes a layer of the sour bread, injera and then the dishes are placed on top and are separated with more rolls of injera. There was also a salad right in the center of the platter. You're meant to just use the bread to scoop up the dishes into your mouth. The quantity of food for 2 people was quite large, and we couldn't finish everything. I also would've liked to have picked the dishes we were receiving! I saw in the menu they had a lot of different dishes and ordering the platter just seemed like a lucky draw.   In terms of flavour, I wasn't blown away. Because of the style of eating and the way the dishes looked similar to Indian food, I think I assumed that there would be more flavour and punch but instead most of the food was pretty bland. This could also be due to the fact that I'm Indian myself and I usually prefer food to have more flavour and spice in general.   The whole vibe of the place was cool though, there was comfy seating, curtains and candles everywhere, very lounge-y and home-y.   Unfortunately, I wouldn't visit again. Although I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it enough to go back. Would recommend to friends though as a cool place to try for the experience, very unique!"}
{"text":"Should I say that we were lucky that our friends canceled our dinner plan? Lol, The show must go on, right?  So, we decided to go to another restaurant and have something a bit healthier tonight.  We decided to have Ethiopian food and wanted to try a place that we have never been before.  I chose Pero based on Yelp reviews. I also purchased a deal from GROUPON for $17 for a PLATTER for two people.  You can choose between Vegetarian (Vegan) or Meat (Pero) options.  It was 47%off from the regular price $32.   AMBIANCE (4 stars) It was a nice restaurant.  You can smell herbs when you just walk in the place.  The smell wasn't too strong.  It went well with the atmosphere and music.  It made us feel very relaxed.   FOOD (4 stars) It was a HUGE platter for two people!  Check my picture!  I'm normally a big woman, but the platter could hide all of my body!  Should I be happy? Lol, We got PERO PLATTER which came with two portions of CHICKEN TIBSI and BEEF TIBSI, and three choices of vegetarian items.   We chose -TIMITIMO TSEBHI (Lentil stew with spices and herbs).  Our waitress suggested us to have this one if we like spicy.  And we love it! - SHERO WITH MUSHROOMS (Chickpeas sauce with sautéed mushrooms).  This one was very tasty. - HAMLI (Green salad with garlic and ginger).  It was sour, but it was nice to have some fresh vegetable to go with the platter.   We also added on THE GORED GORED, served medium rare.  My husband said that they were a bit hard to chew even though it was medium-rare. Maybe other people like it but I didn't think it was the right food for him lol.     After finished all food which we couldn't finish lol. We packed the rest home and ordered the TRADITIONAL COFFEE which was infused with ginger and served with POPCORN.  We had Ethiopian coffee with popcorn before at another restaurant and we like it.  This time we didn't regret it either.  I could smell and taste GINGER from my coffee right away when I was sipping it.     DRINK (4 stars) We ordered the  1/2 liter of TRAPICHE CABERNET SAUVIGNON.  It was $28.  It is cheaper if you get a whole bottle which is $36.  However, we knew we couldn't finish it, so we ordered only  1/2 liter.   PRICE (4 stars) It is the average price.  Maybe a higher than some Ethiopian restaurants.  However, the platter for two people was massive.  If you get a deal from Groupon, you will get almost 50% off from the regular price for the platter for two people.  It's a very good deal.  I was lucky because I got 20% off from the normal deal ($17).  So, I paid $13 for the platter! AND I got 10% discount off from the food from Yelp CHECK-IN!     OVERALL  Good deal from Groupon and Yelp. Nice place. Satisfied!"}
{"text":"OMG this is one of my favourite place to eat. It is so comfortable and cozy, and the food is DELICIOUS. The owner caters to you and is a very nice guy. As an African, I always seem to find East African restaurants OK and not a place to take my western friends.  However Pero's has became that place where I take all of my western friends to, and they all loved it.  I went last week with a friend, and as usual Pero never disappoints. I had the pero's platter for two, I believe it is like $34 dollars, very decent prize for a huge plate; we also tried your majesty....to die for..Yummy.  I recommend this place to anyone, and if you are a group of 3 or more ask to be seated at the back where the couches are; very comfortable.  Thanks Pero & Staff for a lovely experience every time I go to eat.   Love Amal"}
{"text":"A very quiet place with a romantic ambiance, mellow music and quite a few nooks with different decoration styles: they have a spot at the front with couches and cushions that can fit a group of 10 people or so, there are nicely decorated tables with a separator between each and there is a \"tent\" at the back with more cushions and couches - usually a spot for bday parties.  I think it's a great spot for dates and hangouts with friends. I never saw it being busy (at most there was another group of people dining at the same time with us).  I love the food, but as mentioned in few other review the prices are not cheap and it wouldn't be my go-to place on a regular basis."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here with a deal about 6 months ago (I meant to write a review for this place). As I recall, their service was exceptional! We came in without a reservation and it was super busy so they placed us at the bar which we were fine with. 5-10 minutes later, the server comes over to offer us a table instead. All the staff were welcoming, smiley and friendly - they seemed to care to make an impression which is always appreciated.  I can't recall now the dishes name but we ordered an appetizer and 3 meat dishes. We were amazed by the taste - so flavorful and each dish was thoroughly enjoyed. It was our first time in an Ethiopian restaurant so we had no idea how it worked but the server was patient and friendly in explaining to us that there will be no cutlery, just hands! How exciting!   When the meal was over, a bowl of water with flowers came to our tables to dip our fingers in.  It was just a delightful experience - great food, attentive staff. We've come back since with my boyfriends parents (during that visit they gave us complimentary tea after dinner) and plan to come again in the new years!   I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ordered a variety of tasty dishes;  sat back and enjoyed the evening in a nice subdued atmosphere."}
{"text":"I only came here for the weekly music events before the renovations and new management, but since it's been done up I'll have to say I'm sort of the regular and it's all for the food.  I was told they import the spice and spice mixes and it really shows.  Perfect amount of tang and spice to the meet without being overbearing, great variety of dishes and the presentation seems very genuine to me.  Every single person I've brought here has left raving about the food of this hidden gem.  Since the renovations the atmosphere seems (as far as I can tell) very ethnic, and there is luxurious tent at the back replete with couches, a large LCD screen, privacy curtains and footstools if you want to stretch out.  The service here is decent and I've seen the owner personally check up on his guests every time I've been there.  Good service, great food, and an ambiance that takes you somewhere.  It was a good find and I'm going to keep impressing my friends and colleagues by bringing them to Pero R&L."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best Ethiopian restaurant in Toronto.   The restaurant is clean, the ingredients are fresh, and the food is consistently delicious.   I have never been disappointed.   I will happily pay a little more for good service and to avoid finding a hair in my food (unlike the experience I had with the cheaper Ethiopian option down the street)."}
{"text":"A daily deal for a vegetarian platter for 2 enticed us to visit Pero but good food and service would bring me back to Pero.  It was very quiet while we were there. We were the only diners for the most part, other than a few men at the bar. Our server, who I believe is the owner, was very attentive and answered all our questions. He talked us into ordering an appetizing of 'ethiopian sushi' that consisted of injera with spicy lentil pastes inside, rolled up and cut. It was good but very filling, as injera tends to be so make sure you're adeqately hungry before ordering this.  We followed with a veggie platter that was smaller than the standard veg for 2 platter at Nazareth, that we are so used to, but also tasted much fresher. The wats were brightly coloured, something you don't see at Nazareth. We polished it off quickly, though I do remember some pieces of the eating injera being dry on the outside, as if they had been pre-rolled and then sat out, loosing some moisture. Wasn't a big deal though. I don't remember being charge extra for additional injera, otherwise I would consider this a sticking point.  Overall the service was excellent. I like that they have a lot of veg options on their menu and there's this nice little coffee ceremony area that they said is for weekend use and for large groups. The drawbacks here are it's not very busy and I think this is due to the prices. $30 for a veggie platter for 2 vs. the $8 at Nazareth is pretty steep. Yes, quality is a factor but I think $15 per person for what is essentially a lentil dinner just doesn't make sense.  They seem to be trying to go for the fine dining approach and the owner posts a lot of photos of chairs with fancy covers on them, but truly this is not what the ethiopian dining crowd is looking for in Toronto. People want good food and affordability, not frills. That's why Nazareth has a line-up out the door on a Thursday evening and this place only has a few guys at the bar. I'd like to support Pero because the food is good but $15 is more than I want to spend on one dish on my average night."}
{"text":"A great first encounter and experience with Ethiopian food. I went on a Wednesday night and it didn't get busy til around 8pm. I shared a fish and Pero platter with my boyfriend. Delicious and satisfying, it was gluten-free and also kosher. The service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I sat waiting for my dining buddy in a cushioned warm comfy tent. The ambience and warm colours at Pero are immediately comforting and inviting. I was relaxed right after work.  The waitress was very attentive and filled my water glass more times than I can count.   The owner, Pero himself, came out and greeted me! I asked him a million questions about Eritrean culture and he patiently sat with me and explained the rich religious diversity of Ethiopia.  We ordered the Pero platter as I hadn't been here before. It was the right type of tasting menu for people new to the food. 2 meats and 3 veges on a bed of yeasty injera. It was a lot of food. Go hungry! Beef tibs- I will be getting this on it's own next time. Delicately flavored cubes of beef which were al dente to my liking. The sauce soaked the injera right through and I thourougly enjoyed the soppy injera.  Chicken tibs- tibs is just better when beef! Collard greens- tasted like collard greens. Very fresh, not necessarily something I would order again simply because I liked the mushroom vege better. Mushrooms- mushrooms and jalapeños in Berber sauce... I kept eating this! That a mushroom could be made so much more.. Split peas- this was a paste similar to hummus. It was well flavored, I'm just not a fan of pasty lentils.  Injera- perfect.  Pero came by a couple of times to initiate us with the roasting coffee bean smoke. I felt communal, like I was part of the ceremony itself. Again, in Pero fashion, he went over all my questions around why we were served popcorn with coffee? ( that's what his mother did!- good enough for me)  Would I go back? For sure- to meet Pero again and to have a bowl of beef tibs.. All by myself!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to grab a late meal on a Sunday night and my frantic Google/Yelp searched yielded this place.  We were not disappointed by the quality of the food, but it was a little pricey and (perhaps it was just the night) it was dead (we were the only people in the place).  The live music we had heard so much about was not to be seen/heard.  A group of people wandered in looking for the same thing and were turned away (must've been an off night).  Nonetheless, we quite enjoyed our food (the owner even came out and explained the meal) and would probably return given the chance."}
{"text":"Found a Groupon for this place a few weeks ago and decided to try something new.  We didn't really know what to expect when we first walked through the curtain covered entrance. We were greeted by a rush of lovely smelling spices and a very nicely decorated, dimly lit room. Very nice ambiance.  Our waitress was friendly and polite, and recommended a really tasty appetizer.  The vegetarian platter was delicious. It was a very interesting experience overall, since neither of us had ever tried Ethiopian food. The owner gave us tips on how to eat the food and interesting combinations of sauces to try. He was very helpful and we would've been lost without his advice. The spicy red lentils tasted the best.  There was actually no need to add the appetizer, as the platter was already enough food to fill your stomach, but it was worth it because it was good.   We were served freshly roasted coffee and lightly buttered popcorn after our meal. The coffee was really tasty.  Overall: Beautiful atmosphere, delicious food, great service."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and decor. The upstairs is very quiet and feels homie, and you don't hear any noise from downstairs, which is good.  The service was ok. Our waitress was very nice, but the other waitress didn't know anything, and on anything we asked for she'd  reply: ' I'll ask the manager', even if it was a simple question. FYI they don't know about the 10 % discount that is on their Yelp page.  The food was good, but nothing too extraordinary. The menu is pretty small, so we did the platter and the shrimp. Chicken and mushrooms got my vote, although some of the dishes in the platter I didn't like at all. Very interesting concept with eating with your hand, I think it was the best part."}
{"text":"Pero's has ambience, excellent food and a wide selection of drinks. To top it all the owner Pero has a charming personality that compliments the place with his great choice of music that goes really well with the place. I highly recommend Pero's to anyone wanting to have a pleasant time out!!"}
{"text":"Ethiopian cuisine has been on my list of foods to try for the longest time. Now that I have crossed it off, I can say that it is totally worth it! Note: for those who are new to Ethiopian food, cutlery is not required; instead, you use super fluffy injera bread to scoop up the various meats and stews. It'll get pretty messy, but that's just part of the fun (and you'll get a bowl of warm rose water at the end of the meal to clean your hands).  We started with the veggie roll - a chickpea mixture rolled up in injera bread - and my boyfriend and I both loved it. The waiter (owner?) recommended it to us, saying that it was a popular choice, and I can definitely see why; the seasoning in the chickpea stew made it wonderfully flavourful and it paired nicely with the impossibly soft injera bread.   For our main course, we opted for the Pero's platter, which includes beef tibsi, chicken tibsi, and your choice of 3 vegetarian dishes - we got the timitimo tsebhi (lentil stew), hamli (collard greens), and flaxseed stew. My boyfriend said that he actually preferred the vegetarian dishes over the meats and we both agreed that the flaxseed stew was our favourite - highly recommend!   We ended the meal with some traditional Ethiopian coffee (served with popcorn) and it really is a very unique coffee experience - much darker and richer - so it's worth a try if you've never had it before. Overall, the great food and romantic ambiance made for a very enjoyable meal.  (P.S. Check in on Yelp to get 10% off on your first visit)"}
{"text":"Still the best African restaurant I've ever tasted, and one of the best restaurants that I've ever tasted in the world ( real talk people!!). First place I go to when I come to Toronto and the last place I go before I leave. Get the pero platter, the cha cha cha (grilled meat) to go on top of it, and finish it off with some authentic popcorn and coffee. Pero, the owner, will take great care of all his guest."}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious dinner on Friday, January 27 with a couple of girlfriends. We were greeted by the owner himself and what a pleasant man! Staff were nice and attentive throughout the night. Nice, cosy, comfortable and eclectic atmosphere decked out with images, niknaks and paintings from and inspired the homeland.  FOOD was incredible! We had the Collard Greens & Split Pea and Veggie Rolls for the appetizers. Beautifully presented and very delicious. For our main dishes, we had Beef Tibsi and Fish Goulash. I'm not a huge spicy eater and the awaze and berbere were mixed in other spices to create more of a flavour than just heat. Servers explained how to eat the dishes which was greatly appreciated, being our first time eating Ethiopian food. For dessert, we all shared the Coffee Cake, Chocolate Cake and Cheesecake. All were very good and not too sweet. Portion sizes of all dishes were perfect. Highly recommend this place and will be returning to try other items on the menu. Thank you Pero!"}
{"text":"Love the Ethiopian food here and the live jazz music. The shrimp was delightful immersed in spices unknown but a great combination and not too hot. Plenty of injera underneath as well as extra rolls. The sautéed mushrooms were great too. The ambiance is nice and conducive to conversation with the live music downstairs. Been coming here for years and the recent renovations really improved the place."}
{"text":"Food was great and our kids are from Ethiopia so we eat it whenever we have the opportunity. Beautiful atmosphere but it would have fit to have Ethiopian music streaming instead of jazz. Five stars for food quality but the service was extremely slow. We waited about 40 minutes for our food and it was not that busy at 9 pm. Attentive when we needed water refilled; additional drinks but not particularly friendly. My family would definitely go back if we aren't tight for time."}
{"text":"I had been to an Ethiopian restaurant only once before (Ethiopiques) and even though I found it interesting, I wasn't sure whether to give this type of resraurants another try. However, after some other plans fell through we decided to go to Pero and and I must say it was a very good decision.   The food was great. We had the Shiro deep as apperizer and I got The Gigolo as main course. Both came with injera bread and were rich in flavour with spices.  The owner came to chat with us shortly after we were done to check how we liked everything and told us a bit about the dishes. Very nice man.  The setting is a lot more cosy, a bit up-scale but with home-y feeling."}
{"text":"This place was an amazing little experience run by the enigmatic Chef Pero.   I don't know much about Ethiopian food, but I enjoyed every bite of what was presented before me. The lamb was amazing and disappeared quickly as I and my fellow diners discovered how delicious it was. They also offered to make the bread with just fermented teff flour, a more authentic recipe that also happened to be gluten free.  The evening was capped off when we watched Pero set fire to the bar in honour of a friend's birthday. In return, she sang a famous opera excerpt before a stunned and hushed audience. Sure, this was a one-off experience, but looking around the restaurant I can see that Pero has made his place a staple of the Ethiopian community here in Toronto.   I may not live in Toronto, but I am already looking forward to coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Horrible service from the beginning to end. We had a group of 15 and was celebrating a birthday. Reservations and cake being brought in was told to the restaurant prior. We were told we could have the tent booth prior but when we arrived we were seated elsewhere and they were hesitant to give the booth to our group.   Upon the extremely slow service and annoyed waiters of having anything to do with our table, we were told a $15 cork fee was going to be applied for bringing in a cake. 10mins later we were told it's now 30$ because it's $15 per 6 people. None of this mentioned before and confused with the changing fees, we still waited about 20mins for plates to be brought out for the cake. Upon paying for our bill we were now told we were given a discount of $20 for the cork fee.  With slow and rude and absent service, the food was mediocre. I would not come back here and everyone at the table agreed.   They also do groupons which is to encourage new customers to try and come back again so I don't understand why they would lack in such bad service.   The owner came by once and was polite but that was about it. 1/5 star."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and it has been excellent each time.   One of my favourite Ethiopian spots in the city, and some of the best lentils I've had.   While they do offer meat, Pero has excellent vegetable dishes - definitely a must-have.   A great thing about Ethiopian food is that you eat with your hands - and when eating with friends, it can act as an immensely personal experience.   I can't say enough about this place. Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Most people have never tried Ethiopian food before they should start right here.  Great service even better when the owner Pero is in the house. He takes pride in his work and takes time to explain the Eritrean delicacies. The injira might be strange for some at first but when you start eating and tasting those flavours wow delicious. I recommend getting the platter! This place is also great for vegetarians because let's face it there's not a whole lot of options for vegetarians out there.  Service is always lovely. Finishing off with the traditional coffee and popcorn is always a delight. Try it!"}
{"text":"We went as a group of 5 and had reserved the tent. It was all of ours first time trying Ethiopian food and the owner made sure we were well informed and recommended dishes for us as well - it was all DELICIOUS. A great first experience, would definitely be open to trying more meals here."}
{"text":"Really lovely peaceful tasteful atmosphere. My mum and I shared the veggie platter. Generally good, but some dishes were a touch bland. Very friendly staff, the chef came out and brought a scoop of our favorite dish to entice us to finish our injera. Ginger tea was nice, made with fresh ginger, and the wine was very reasonably priced. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"With a live band that speaks to your soul and food that satisfies the taste buds, Pero's serves up a platter of soul food that will do more than just fill you up!   Pero's is a north african restaurant/lounge located on Bloor Street in between Ossington and Christie.  The dim lighting and collection of African art work on the walls add to the amazingly chilled out ambience that this place already emits.    The food is pretty standard Ethiopian cuisine: flavourful meat stews and a wonderful collection of vegetarian dishes served on these giant platters so that they can be shared among a family or a group of friends.  While you can be the odd one out and try to fork and a knife this meal, I recommend getting the full experience by rolling up those sleeves, grabbing a crepe like roti and going to work with your hands.    While the food is on par with other Ethiopian hot spots in the city, the music is really what brings you back to this place.  On a friday or saturday night, you can come in and experience some live R & B and soul...but to get the full feel of this place, i recommend coming out on a sunday night.  Drawn in by the fusion of the African hand drums and a live soul band, herds of people come in with their famillies and friends to support Pero's on a sunday night.  Good food and great music that will get you high on life in no time...and if that doesn't work...they got a pretty decent bar that might do the trick!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Decor was purposeful immersed by cultural or Safariist's deeply rooted  from the Horn of Africa. They served food & roasted coffee culturally . It was exotic experience! entertainment primarily multi nation was great. My best Safariist  experience. Vegetarian  combo my #1 choice. Dero/Derho or the \"Majesty\" #1 Meat product for me."}
{"text":"First off,  the whole place has been renovated and its much more intimate and authentic looking.  It would probably be a good idea for them to post it on their website instead of the 360 view which they have on the website.  The pictures would do more justice.  The food is quite delicious.  It does not really take too many chances, offers pretty standard Ethiopian fare with quality being the front running factor.  The host or General Manager is probably worth just the visit.  Very hospitable, makes you feel like you are in is home and is very knowledgeable on the food and the culture.  They will be rebuilding the downstairs lounge which already looks quite impressive to match the intimate and more modern look of the upstairs dining area.  Thank you Pero(Also the General Manager's name we found out) for the beautiful experience.  I will definitely be back and would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for something different in Toronto's boring and monotonous food scene.  The must have is the coffee and the Injera sushi roll.  Actually the only reason why I would give this place a 4 is for such an array of options there is no dessert.  But if you don't have a sweet tooth like me I think this place is more of a 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"It was a fun experience to eat here. We were with a big group (about 12 of us) and they were easily able to accommodate us on a Friday night. I ordered Pero's Platter which had both meat and veggie options - all were great. I especially liked the Shero (roasted chickpeas cooked with onion and spices) and Mushroom Tibsi. The Beef and Chicken Tibsi and Flaxseed Stew were pretty good too! It's served with injera which is like a slightly sour crepe that you scoop up the saucy food with and eat using your fingers. We tried our friend's Fish Goulash and it was REALLY good... definitely ordering that next time we come!   Also, it's a vegetarian friendly place as a few in our group were vegetarians and they were pleased with the options.   A bunch of us ordered the coffee and it was pretty good. Make sure you order it with your food because it takes about an hour for them to prepare. They brew it with ginger which is an interesting twist!"}
{"text":"Let's consider this a review-in-progress, shall we?    On the afternoon of a sunny yet still cold Sunday, I decided that rather than attend to necessary chores such as laundry and grocery shopping, I was in the mood for some delicious food, drink and a taste of live music.  Pero Ethiopian resides on the cusp of Christie Park, surrounded by several other similar options.  By far the most attractive from the curb side, the decor provides a proper ambiance for a lounge, regardless of food type.  The candlelight, low light and dark paint create a cozy and intimate atmosphere.  The addition of a photo stream along the walls showing compelling images of the Ethiopian country side provides a simple but welcome color palette to the atmosphere.  Sunday night promises laid back, soulful live music which was provided by vocalist Natasha Waterman and guitarist Devrim Eldelekli.  The mood was perfect - not too loud, just soft enough to either converse with friends or pay attention - your choice.  The menu was surprising - not the contents so much as the fact that it doesn't match the website, either in content or price. Their web menu promised whiskey at 4.50, but in reality was 6 dollars.  The food was also slightly more expensive than expected.  This is a problem that should be remedied.  As I was not very hungy, I tried only the chickpea roll appetizer to munch on during the music.  The flavour was perfect - the right blend of spice, texture and serving size.  The only problem was that it was slightly cooled, and tasted as though it were meant to be prepared warm.  Service was slightly slow, I had to wait several minutes after the completion of a drink to order another.  I would have expected that considering it was relatively empty that they would have jumped at the chance to serve more 6 dollar whiskeys, ASAP.  All in all, a nice and relaxing Sunday evening.  Excellent for a small group that wishes to enjoy some soft music and each other's company, as well as a delicious portion of food.  Any other night of the week and I might suggest another restaurant with more competivie prices and choices, but for Sunday night, Pero is a good option."}
