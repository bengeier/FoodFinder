{"text":"OH MY GOSHHHHHH!!!!!
I literally just came from Embassy
Did I just die and go to heaven?
YESSSSSSSSS!!!!!


While dining in, my ol' friend and I, ordered: 

VEGGIE SAMOSAS- -5/5- - SO GOOOOOD , and make sure you get the tamerin sauce too(plus we ordered 25 more for my family at the take-out part of embassy)

BUTTER CHICKEN - - 5/5 - - said..it had a little kick to it..the chicken was juicy

Mutter Paneer -  - 5/5 - - and I thought Saravanaa Bhavan was the best!! This puts that to shame, haha.  It had the perfect amount of spice to it. PLUS, it was $4.99. HALF THE PRICE OF OTHER RESTAURANTS!!!!YET WAYYY BETTER!!!

Naan - - 3/5 -- This was the only downer. It wasn't horrible, yet it wasn't that delish. I wish it was more fluffier.

Ras Malaii -- 5/5 -- *DROOOOOOOOL* ....it was so good, i had to go to the take-out section and order 5 more for home (yes, i'm a fatty =D)"}
{"text":"Amazing place with lots of variety and at good prices!
Service is not the greatest but cant expect too much for a busy and cheap place."}
{"text":"I visited Samosa King while in the neighborhood. Please note that this is more of a takeout place only and not a eat in. 

The prices are very good. It was just $4.99 plus tax for a helping of rice, a portion of savoury butter chicken, and an egg. 

The portions are quite good. There was just enough sauce for the rice without being too saucy or too dry, although I prefer to have my rice drowned in sauce. This was the first time having butter chicken that was spicy so it was a pleasant surprise. The chicken itself was just perfect. The texture of the chicken was not dry; it was just perfect. 

The service was very quick. There were at least 4 people working behind the counter on a Sunday evening. 

I will definately be coming back to try the other options. I noticed that they also had a variety of pastries including samosas that were 5 for $1. I only wish I had enough time to look at what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Just called in to place an order for dhokla worth $100 to be picked up Saturday afternoon, the man who answered told me they don't take phone orders, and to call back Saturday then they will make it, perfect buddy, now if I want it I not only have to call back but possibly wait for my order.

Where can I get good dhokla?"}
{"text":"Ripped me Off. Took US $ said its equivalent to Canadian $ they charged me extra. They didn't want to take my US credit card. 
Worse Biryani I ever ate and it seemed Rasmalie had baby powder to make it creamer. 
Will not be returning."}
{"text":"5 Samosas for a dollar. Beat that! Just prepared to wait in line for at least 20 mins on weekends."}
{"text":"5 vegetarian samosas for A DOLLAR. 
Amazing and delicious. 
I once bought 60 for a party (apparently you only need to order in advance if you want more then a few hundred of them). Driving to the party with a couple bags of fresh samosas has convinced me that there should be a samosa air refresher."}
{"text":"Busy take-out place, very cheap samosas, lots of variety to choose, lunch special, desserts, everything you want at one place. I'm not indian so don't know how is the authenticity but i saw a lot of indians customers which is usually a good sign. I tried chicken tikka, curry, rice, and the desserts. Very salty food, and very sweet desserts. Kidney, diabetes patients visit less is better. Solid 4/5"}
{"text":"Tasty and very affordable food especially for those into South Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Best Samosas in Toronto. Long lines always but they move fast.

I have yet to find a samosa that compares."}
{"text":"Always fresh and tasty samosas, jalebi (spelling?) and roti. There's usually a line up so give yourself extra time. Customers don't mind waiting"}
{"text":"The horrible place to take your family.

The people working there can't speak english. I asked if they could warm up my food for which a guy working there bluntly said 'NO'.I was taken aback by his response so I asked 'sorry, why no'? , the guy says microwave not working broken'.. I would have agreed if he said in a polite way or atleast explained the situation.  Come on , customer serive obviously matters.  When I realised he lied about microwave i went to his colleague who offered to warm up my food the first guy came running to the second guy and prompted him not to warm and said ' microwave stopped working I told her'. Then the other guy was a little surprised and gave my food back.  It was very obvious to the people standing there that first guy ran to the second guy just to save his big ass when I realise that was a lie from second guy.   And food is all oily and someone working next door told me that it is not fresh and please don't  buy because he had stomach upset after dining at samosa king. Beware guys. I asked for just 2 peices of bajji And the first guy said it it 5 for $5. I said i just want 2 peices and the first guy kept repeating what he said. He basically was arrogant."}
{"text":"My favorite place for samosa,masala dosa and sweets!!! You can't go wrong with 5 samosas for a $1. Samosas are so delicious and very fresh. The masala dosa is to die for. It comes with coconut chutney.You have to check it out if u haven't been there."}
{"text":"Everyone goes for the samosas which are pretty good. The masala dosa is good as well as the kothu roti and biryani. I am kind of annoyed that the biryani doesn't come with a piece of tandoori chicken anymore but food cost are going up so i understand."}
{"text":"Sucks soooo much for bulk party orders!!! You can't call in orders. I waited 1 hr. for 300 samosas. They wouldn't take orders even if you were in line waiting until u got to the register. I waited 20 mins just in line. Would have walked right out if it werent for a charity event. Worse customer service and they would look at their customers in disgust when asking simple questions on timing. Ridiculous!!  Losing a big customer for this one incident and I will spread the word corporately. There are other providers just as good out there. With bettercustomer service!"}
{"text":"The Samosa Nazi! (Kinda like the Soup Nazi)

Stand in line, point at what you want, move to the front, pay with cash and off you go, don't try to bump ahead, be respectful and get respect in return.

5 Samosa's for a Dollar, now that is a steal, and they taste pretty good. They have various indian sweets and some of them are better than the stuff you can get in India itself. I would highly recommend the White Peda's and the Milk Cakes. 

They also do have a sit in restaurant attached next door, that serves a wide selection of food. There are lots of vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options available.

The server's might not know what gluten free means, so you might have to spell it out for them and they will be willing to tell you the ingredients in the dishes (at the restaurant).

Besides samosa's they have various other things for you. If you aren't familiar with the items get at least one new thing every time, so you can get exposed to all the flavour indian food has to offer, and that way you will know what to order next time."}
{"text":"SAMOSA KING has one of the best deals in town. Veggie or meat samosas are 5 for $1.  And fish samosas are 4 for $1.  They're quite addictive. Crunchy shell with a tasty filling. I've purchased 80 samosas and frozen them to enjoy later on. 80 may seem like a lot but I usually see people ordering 50 or more at a time.

I'm not able to visit daily since I live out of town but when I'm in town I try and stop by. Line-ups are insanely long but the cashiers are quick and courteous. 

I just started to try their take-out menu. On Tues and Fri, they have a Toonie special, 3 vegetable curries and rice. Their palak panneer, channa and mixed vegetables are delicious.

Parking is a bit hellish especially if you park right off Middlefield. There's plenty of room if you park close to the Tim Horton's drive thru."}
{"text":"I'm been coming here for the past 8 or so years.  I only get one thing.

5 samosas for $1. 
1 cup of sweet red sauce for $1.

These are great for parties.  Buy $10 worth of samosas, plus the sauce, and you'll be good.

The line-up can be bad.  They still haven't figured out a better way to streamline the ordering/paying process.  It is inefficient."}
{"text":"On Saturday, near noon, the line was not too bad.

We ordered 10 Samosas -- they gave us 15, the tandoori chicken and naan special, two extra naan and a large butter chicken

Our total came to $20.30 including tax but we did not take our receipt. Working backwards,  3.99 + 8.99 + 3 x 1.00 + 2 x 1.00 x 1.13 = $20.30. So somehow they charges us 2 bucks for 2 naan but it should be 60 cents each. Even if they they charged us for 3 naan and forgot the free one that came with the tandoori chicken that would make it $20.09. So perhaps watch out for their accounting.

The samosa was hot and fresh and tasty. I'm not a connoisseur of samosas. It was good. It might be close to the best I've ever had, but samosas are not a real favourite of mine, so even the best can only excite me so much, but these were really good.

The tandoori chicken was cold. We heated it up in the microwave at home but if you are eating out, you shouldn't have to do this. Once heated up it was really good, but marks off for that.

I am assuming it was hot when we got it and that microwaved reheated butter chicken will taste as good as the original sitting in the warming tray. It was pretty good, a B, nothing extraordinary.

My wife said she had better near her sister's house in Brampton.

Bottom line, I was not blown away but the food was good and I would come back.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Portions are perfect, food is tasty and the people are wonderful. Honestly the owners and the staff are SO KIND and pleasant. Support this wonderful local business. I recommend it to everyone :)"}
{"text":"I've never tried anything else here but since I live far where I can't get good samosas I ALWAYS make sure to get their samosas whenever I'm in town (so whenever I can pretty much). Their samosas are the only samosas I crave and eat. I will have to agree with other reviewers in that they do have ridiculous/disorganized line up process but never bothered me much because their samosas are worth the wait."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Samosa spot in the Greater Toronto area.
They sell 5 Samosas for $1- it has been the same price for the last 8 years.
People drive to get samosa from places one hour away.
They also have other Indian sweets and savouries.
There is always a long line up no matter when you go, but they move very fast.
The samosas are fresh. 
The only place in Toronto you need to go to get Samosas :)
The name Samosa King is  well suited."}
{"text":"This is the place to be if you want authentic Indian take out at a good price. They make the best samosa at a dirt cheap price. 5 for 1 dollar. Their curry lamb and butter chicken are awesome too. Expect long line up during evenings and weekends. But it's worth the line up."}
{"text":"offers cheap samosas with their distinct fried wrapper.. their deal hadn't changed for over the 3 years I've been going here. 

5 vegetable samosas for $1 or 2 chicken samosas for $1. 

yeah it's cheap but the samosa' aren't the the best, however they aren't that bad either. 

I try a new indian dessert every time I'm here since they have a great selection. 

very cool spot as you can get desserts, appetizers, or main dishes. 

take heed though, eating here too often will likely cause a heart attack or diabetes. :o  your brown paper takeout bag is usually soaked with grease from your goods."}
{"text":"$1 for 5 samosas? What else needs to be said, do your life a favour and go now. AMAZING."}
{"text":"Samosa king is a amazing place to pick up yummy food for party, or just cause you want to enjoy yourself! The quality is great and extremely affordable. They have 5 samosas for $1. Like really? Where else can you find that?! Oh and the sweet red sauce to dip them in...to die for. A dynamic duo! You have to check this place out. There's a long row of endless possibilities of food to choose from and also order. You just don't know where to start or stop."}
{"text":"The queue for samosas are long and slow. Always. But they are worth the wait. For the Taste and the price you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is probably the best samosa place in the GTA. The staff is always pleasant and works extremely hard to keep the place running smoothly. 5 tasty and crispy samosas for $1 is unbeatable. They are flavourful, juicy and go try one yourself and you'll get..."}
{"text":"I love their pakoras and samosas! Samosas are good. Good price, 5 for $1. This place is clean. The desserts look amazing. But I mainly come here for samosas and pakoras. Really good!"}
{"text":"Not that good if you know samosas.  They serve only 1 kind - veggie and weak on taste. Cheap doesn't equate quality. Better to go to sultan of samosas where you have a choice of 10 kinds, and for beef samosas, try Iqbal foods on parkway forest drive in the plaza."}
{"text":"Great food!   Great price!  Love their samosas (5 for $1) and sweets.  Almost always busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"The problem with this store for me is not the quality of food, which is pretty good, but the service of the staff and the management. I have been going for this store for a number of years and it has never changed. I feel the underlying factor is a sense of arrogance they feel knowing that people will come to their store regardless of how they treat them. There is always a rude attitude when they talk to you, they never greet you or apologise for any delays no matter how long you stay in the line to get your stuff. They have a two line system one for the over the counter items and the other for the freshly prepared food. If you stood in one line for a long time and ordered a mix of over the counter and freshly prepared items they would bluntly say that you can't do both here and ask you to go to the other line. Which I feel is very bad customer service. And its not just the guys who are serving you but also the people in the management who usually take your payment at the end. They treat you the same if not worse and this really does not sit well with me. 

Last week I noticed a gentleman who ordered 200 samosas and I was shocked to hear that if you wanted those samosas in a box (instead of a bag) then you had to pay $2 extra. I know it's a convenience and a business but that guy is ordering 200 samosas! Again another blunder in customer service in my opinion. 

You usually won't notice such things if you go once in a while but if you are quite regular you start to notice these things and it bothers you. I wish they take an effort to fix this to provide an even better service to the customer."}
{"text":"The line up is  usually out the door great food for a great price.  The samosas  are really good.  Love  the variety of Indian sweets"}
{"text":"Pretty much the cheapest place I know in Toronto for samosas. My experience has only been weekday lunch hours so usually it's not as packed, however I always find the lineups confusing. Do you line up near the counter where they serve their different sauces or do you line up near the fried food? 
Otherwise besides the confusion and at times slow service the food is decent, there is a huge selection and the prices are cheap. They still have 5 veggie samosas for 1 dollar and roti for 60 cents each. Their daily specials of 2.49 for rice and 3 veggie curries is also worth it for the price. 
As long as they serve out the same decent food for this price I'll be back whenever I feel the urge for samosas."}
{"text":"Catered a party today and the food was amazing. The butter chicken was a huge hit. Samosas and Pacoras  are amazing. The Tandoori chicken was fantastic. I can't say enough great things about the food."}
{"text":"Wow, all I have to say is 5 samosas for $1!!! An absolutely \"mind-blasting\" price! Samosas are always very fresh as they sell bags and bags full all day long. I've been coming to this place for years. Makes a great snack. Also many other selections of deserts and hot food items."}
{"text":"Best samosas I've tried in Scarborough and with 5 for a damn loonie you can't go wrong. Anytime I want something quick and filling to eat late, I just make a quick stop here cuz they're open till 11pm and get my samosa fix. I don't know about everybody else but when I buy mines they are always hot and fresh. Get their spring rolls too, it's also 5 for a loonie! I always get $3 samosas and $1 spring rolls. Comes up to $4.20. And get their tamarind sauce on the side too, think it's like 55¢. Only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is the lineup is always so damn long and the workers move like snails, they're so damn slow yo."}
{"text":"A dollar for 5 samosas. What's not to love? The potato balls are also cheap and very good. But, the line is extremely long most of the time and is a little confusing."}
{"text":"this place makes the best rolls EVER! seriously, the rolls tasted better here than they did in some places in sri lanka! 
i didn't try any of the other food though - just the rolls. next time i am in toronto, i will definitely come back and try the other stuff. And the price is unbeatable."}

This place is full of inexpensive and tasty indian food. The small curries are $2.49 and enough to fill you up, one naan is less than a dollar (and portion wise more like two naans). 

There are tons of options.

This really is a great place to fill your stomach on a dime."}
{"text":"$1 for 5 samosa. I`ve been buying these bad boys for years to bring as a party favourite. Bring your loose change!"}

{"text":"Food 4.5/5 (50% of final grade)

I haven't been to many South-Asian restaurants, so my view may be biased, but Samosa King samosas are TO DIE FOR. Today I ordered samosas, a breaded and deep fried green pepper, some mini cornmeal donut hole thingies, and a deep fried dumpling with spice and coconut (?) filling. Everything was spectacular, but be aware -- most of their foods are deep fried, heavily seasoned, or very salty, so you might feel very bloated after one or two samosas. All in all, for party foods, Samosa King is my go-to place. Their samosas are all I crave and dream of sometimes. One day, I tell myself, I shall go in there, $100 in hand, and just splurge on all the assortments available. I did notice, however, that their samosas have shrunk a little since the last time I visited about half a year ago, but all is swell. It's a wonderland of variety and deliciousness :')

Ambiance 3/5 (15% of final grade)

A strong smell of curry whacks you in the face the moment you step into the shop, which is not necessary a bad thing. The establishment is not notably clean or dirty either.This place is apparently also a banquet hall, which is completely sealed off from the shop consumers usually visit to purchase food. The interior is lit with somewhat dim lights on the side, and mostly illuminated by the long display of colourful foods. The place is usually packed though, so space is not favourable. This would be the ideal place for you to go to an hour or two before a party to get your party munchies, because it does take time to line up. Not a sit-down and chill establishment. I love how they display all their goodies though, because then for someone who is not South-Asian, they can order what they find visually appealing, and not simply stare at English renditions of ethnic food names. Or, you know, I might just really like the place because it means samosa-time is soon. 

Service 2/5 (15% of final grade)

I was the only non-South-Asian in line, so I felt sheepish to ask what a certain food was, since it seemed that everyone lining up knew exactly what everything was. The environment is very fast-paced as well, but gosh was I dying to know what those little frites were. There was a gentleman replenishing some of their curries (which I've yet to try), and when I finally decided that it was a good time to ask him (when it looked like he had a moment) he said \"Sweet.\" I asked what type, and all he did was repeat \"Sweet.\" Now, there may have been a language barrier, but from how he enunciated the word and how quickly he understood and processed my question, I think that he simply didn't want to explain. He most definitely had the product knowledge, but his attitude was leave-me-alone-and-don't-ask-questions. I understand that it is a fast-paced environment, but I think it only professional to answer a customer's question about their foods slightly more elaborately.

Cost 5/5 (10% of final grade)

$1 for 5 vegetable samosas, each samosa being about 2.5\" x 2.5\" x 2.5\" x 1\"? I THINK YES. 
From the constant volume of customers it is also safe to say that some people come for the curries as meals, and they also seem pretty satisfied with the prices. Nothing stood out as particularly expensive anyway. The prices were all a bang for the buck from what I ordered.

Other 2/5 (10% of final grade)

Brownie-points round! I was near the end of the line when I've already ordered and was waiting to pay. Suddenly a beautiful arrangement of red fried stuff catches my eyes from the other side of the display. I asked the young gentleman what it was and he said, with a smile, \"fried onions\". I asked him how much it was and after he told me the price, I requested to purchase one of the bigger pieces (as it was weighed and priced that way for this particular item). He chuckled and handed me a small free sample piece after having understood my intention to try the food. I thought that this was a very nice gesture that he didn't need to do, but he did anyway. I mean, he could have just shoved a piece into a paper-bag for me, but he was nice enough to just give me a free piece, which was nice. 'Cause, you know, food. I didn't end up purchasing more of the fried onions, because the same gentleman quickly busied himself with another customer and I didn't like it quite enough to order when I had piping samosas waiting for me.

Final Grade = 74/100 (Four Stars*)
*Originally off one point from four stars, but I love it too much to give it anything less, so Four Stars it gets! Also, it's been there since I was but an itsy bitsy student, so it's sort of the go-to for me in terms of nostalgia and yummy snacks!

Summary: For anyone to develop a craving for a specific food from a certain place means that the establishment is doing something right. Samosa King samosas for life. Give yourself at least 15 minutes waiting time though-- it's worth it."}
{"text":"5 for $1 samosas! Great food, great meals and rock bottom prices.

The line is always out the door and this is a super long restaurant and that says a lot.

And given the fact that the area has many times of similar cuisine which have low prices and high quality, the fact that people come her says a lot.

Whenever I am in the area I spend maybe $25 or $30 and that gets me and the GF food for days! 

If you are ever in the area you MUST give it a shot!"}
{"text":"You can't really beat 5 veggie samosas for a dollar. It's an insane deal for a snack or to bring to a party. They don't really cheap out on size or flavour either: they're crispy and rich on the outside and tasty with a bit of a kick on the inside. Everything else I've tried here has also been excellent (and cheap) from roti and pakoras to the large selection of Indian candies and sweets.
Be prepared for long lineups around mealtimes, but you can call ahead to set up large orders. And the parking lot can be a little crazy. I've only ever once had them run low on samosas and had to wait a few minutes which is fairly remarkable considering the hundreds they usually sell as I wait in line on a typical visit. 
Worth a stop for a snack if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I don't have much to compare to but their samosas are amazing! They are somewhat a childhood staple. 5 samosas for $1! Service isn't amazing but it is pretty quick. The price hasn't changed over the 10 years that I've had samosas from here. Quality hasn't changed much either!

Recently I tried a variety of their sweets! you can buy these by the piece or by the pound. Mix and match for some fruitful delightful surprises! The sweets are more on the sweeter side. My favourite was their almond halwa. 

It is also a take out place for hot foods but i have tried that yet!

The restaurant is also fairly clean. If youre around the area and need quick filling snack that can be shared, stop by and try their samosas!!!"}
{"text":"Veggie samosas are 5 for $1.  That's the best deal in town.  So delicious when it just came out of the fryer. Long line-up though."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised about the positive reviews of the samosas. These were among the worst samosas that I've ever had!! Maybe I just don't like this type. They consist mainly of the fried dough (because the dough is so thick). Yes it's cheap, but we bought 10 and ended up throwing 7 of them away. 

Apart from that, the ordering process is really strange. You have to place the order for the things that need to be cooked at the very end. So more waiting after you've already waited in a long line. The guy who serves you should be able to place the order for the cooked food at the very start. 

We tried a few different things. Got a bunch of food for only $30. 

The good:
-the sweets are really good. I'm not sure about the names, but we tried a few and all were delicious. Don't  eat too much though otherwise you'll get diabetes!! 
-the tandoori was fantastic. One of the best I've ever had actually. The chicken was really moist, and the flavor was great
-the wadais were great (and cheap) 
-dosas: they were a little stingy with the potato filling, but after adding the sauces it tasted decent, and the price was excellent

The bad:
-samosas
-biriyani: mainly rice. You'd need to order a meat dish to add
-roti's were not as good as other places 

The average:
-butter chicken. It was okay. Too salty though. Won't order again

I won't be back. Babu is quicker and better tasting in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here specifically for the samosa ... It was not overly busy when I came in I was in and out within 10 minutes... everyone loved them :) price is right very flavourful I ordered the vegetarian .. will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Went to this place for takeout and it was super busy. 

The veg samosas are so cheap and SO good. You can literally spend next to nothing and get full off of them. 

The tandoori chicken with biryani was really good too. 

I'll definitely be back for the samosas."}
{"text":"This place is great for Cheap Eats. Somosa are always great here. My advice, do not go between 3-6PM the line up is discouraging. If you have to go try midday around 12-1PM the line up is not that bad. I have never tried anything else here other than the Somosas. The 5 for $1 cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Good veggie samosas at a great value of 5 for $1.  Chicken samosas weren't very good though, too much onions and not enough meat.  Would like it if they had the option of beef samosas.  Place is busy but line moves fast.  Experience was good overall."}
{"text":"been going to this place for like 5 years+ (can't remember, seems like it's there forever)

Tried the 5 for $1 Samosa, it's great!

you see people line up on special occasions, that they would buy 100+ Samosas (during line up, they sold over 5000 before it's my turn),   huge boxes of sweets, you can tell their stuff is really good.

I guess I tried all the deep fried items. even it's deep fried food, they are not greasy at all. once you reheat it in the oven, you don't see any oil \"bleed\" out from the food, and it tasted just as good as you bought it fresh from their kitchen.
(you really taste the ingredient.)"}
{"text":"Great place.  Amazing Indian food and samosas for cheap.  And they have different specials on different days...Highly recommend.  Great place in Scarborough"}
{"text":"Fantastic samosas (hello?! 5 for a buck....yeah!!!!) 
Amazing takeout options 
Huge sweets selection 

The parking lot - a muther flocking nightmare 

I have eaten in the restaurant and had take out. Not a huge fan of their dosa, but the butter chicken is quite good. 

This place is very reasonably priced and usually not too busy. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"No matter when I come, I always find myself in a long line. I mainly come for their indian sweets selections, I have never had a bad sweet from them. Usually a box of 8 comes to about 6$. It's not as good as the ones from india but it's definately a good try."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Friday at 11:45am.  The line up was about 15 people for the samosas, spring rolls and rotis and about 6 for the hot table with the curries and rice. The line up for ordering is confusing because there is a line up for the curries and other hot food, and another for the fried foods. After I waited in 2 lines, I heard someone order the curries and then asked the server to walk to the fried food area and get him the samosas as well.

I purchased the daily special of 3 selection of vegetable curries on rice for $2.49, samosas 5 for $1, and a small curried goat for $4.99.  All of the food was delicious and spiced for my taste. My friend bought a small container of tamarind sauce for $1 to go with the samosas.

There were display cases filled with sweets and Indian snacks but I didn't try any.

The service for the hot table of curries was too slow because there wasn't many people when I ordered.  Other reviewers noted that some people seem to be served faster or better than others. As another reviewer stated, I would go back again to see if the service is better. 

The location is at the corner of an industrial plaza with the parking in the back and side of the building."}
{"text":"I am very sad to do this but I'm going to have to downgrade this place to 3 stars (from 5 stars).  I had takeout here recently and the quality of the food has gone downhill and the prices have gone up.

The Chicken Kothu Roti is now $4.99 and the portion is smaller.  There is also less meat.  The Meat Thali has also gone up by a dollar, so it's now ($5.99), and the portions are also stingier.  I got 2 small pieces of chicken curry, a tablespoonful of spinach curry and 2 tablespoonfuls of peas and paneer curry, and a moderate amount of basmati rice.  It still came with a naan (although even the naan is smaller than it used to be) and a Gulab Jamun.    

The Mutton Rolls are still $0.75 but they are now mostly potato, with very little mutton.  The meat samosas are still 2 for $1 but they are smaller with less meat than they used to have.

So all in all, the food is ok, but since they are skimping on the protein, it's even more dense in carbs now and doesn't taste as good as it used to.  Also with the price increases and the portion-size decreases, it's not as much of a bargain as it used to be.  It's still pretty cheap to eat here, but it's not as awesome as a deal as it used to be.  Sad face."}
{"text":"Unbeatable $1 for 5 samosa prices! Samosas got smaller over the years but hey, still in high demand! They also have great deals on dosas on special days of the week and a delicious sambar!"}
{"text":"What better place for my first foray into the world of Samosas than this popular East-end institution.

On an early weekend morning I was lucky to avoid a messy parking situation or a long lineup when I finally made it into the store.

The Veggie samosas (5 for $1) are insanely popular but the Chicken samosas (2 for $1) and the Mutton rolls (75 cents each) also make for a nice snack as well.

Ultimately, most eateries offer a subset of Price, Quality and Quantity and that's no different with Samosa King.  And although most reviewers would emphasize the inexpensive price of the veggie samosas, I think you'd be better off paying a bit more for better quality samosas elsewhere.  They just didn't do it for me, sorry.

One final note, to the gent who served me but doesn't deem it necessary to thank his customer for their patronage, \"Thank you for letting me shop there.\""}
{"text":"RIPOFF! Stay away!!!

- Terrible service.
- Food is cold.
- Cash only but only states that at the end of the line.
- I paid for samosas but never got any.
- Worst way to staff a business. Understaffed and then create a long line for orders. People need to wait forever.
- No names of items in the display case. You need to go all the way to the to come back all the way to the front to be able to order.
- Staff doesn't know the names of the items and can't be bothered to ask for help.

All in all, a huge ripoff!!!"}
{"text":"Like other reviewers have noted you can't go wrong with this place. Samosas are fresh and nicely seasoned. I would prefer my filling to be spicier so I add pepper sauce. I will only stop by during off peak hours..usually weekdays just as they open and I've never had more than one or two people ahead of me. Selection of other fried goodies is impressive although I have only tried the samosas."}
{"text":"Samosas are pretty good and cheap; can't beat that. I also like their onion pakora (basically fried onion pieces with spices and you eat them like chips). Line can get really long and it can be a a bit of a wait even though the staff are pretty quick on their feet. 

A slight negative is that this place has a really local feel and the customers know exactly what they want when they come to Samosa King. the ordering environment is pretty fast paced so it's a bit awkward if you don't know what you want right away; what with all the customers behind you staring impatiently."}
{"text":"I came here this afternoon, after visiting a nearby warehouse sale.  I've passed this place a few times but haven't ventured in, till today.  

Seen all the Yelp reviewers saying how great the samosas are and the place is called Samosa King.  We ordered 20 veg samosas and was tempted to get more, as the people after us, were buying loads of them.  Boy am I glad we only got 20.  The wrapper is thick, hard and slightly sweet.  The filling is not much and not that good.  I usually buy samosas from Babu Babu and whenever I get them, the kids are all over a them and eat them all up in no time.  They left 12 in the bag and this was after school, when they're starving.  We also got a daily special, consisting of basmati rice plus a choice of 3 veg curries.  The price was $2.49.  I thought I read it wrong and looked a few times.  We also got a large potato curry, small veg curry and a veg biriyani.  The food wasn't particularly good but considering the price, you can't really complain.  The veg biriyani was just coloured and very spicy rice with minimal veg.  

The service was ok, it wasn't busy when we ordered but after we had paid(and were waiting for our biriyani) there was a long queue of 15 people.  They were all buying samosas and other deep  fried foods.

You definitely get what you pay for here.  Below average prices for below average food.  I've been looking for good South Asian food, since I moved to Canada.  Brits love curry and bar going to South Asia or somebody's house, I have been disappointed with the stuff I've tried here.  My Indian friends say that there's a couple of good places in Brampton but I haven't ventured there yet.  I'll just stick to Babu Babu for now, which is more expensive but with better food than here.  I cannot understand why everyone has rated this place 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"5 Samosa for a buck. Should I carry on? This place should be call Dollar store Samosa. The best Samosa in town and for the price you can feed whole of India and China :-) 

Other food are ok. The Dosa is not that bad. I am not a huge fan of South Indian food. 

All I can say is if you are passing this neighbourhood and like Samosa don't feel shy to stop at this place even if you have to make a U turn and kill a cow. :-)"}
{"text":"Regardless of what taste your craving, sweet, salty, sour, or spicy, Samosa King has got you covered: they have an array of curries, sweets, and snacks to sink your teeth into!  If you're a carbs lover like me, then you need to emerge yourself in the world of Naan.  
The samosas have gotten smaller over the years... but it's still the great taste I know and love.  This place is always packed, which speaks to the quality meals and dishes they offer!"}
{"text":"Came to try out the veggie samosa dollar deal.

Impressive looking array of product offerings, but I went straight for the samosas today. Since it's weekday afternoon, no crazy line-up like some people here mentioned. Good thing cuz I have no patient for long line-ups.

4 star for good deal. They are no doubt great for the price. The samosas' fillings was fair and tasty, but I find them too doughy. I've had better (friend's homemade ones actually :) )

It is still a nice cheap option for snack or potluck though."}
{"text":"5 samosas for a buck, how do you beat this?

The dangerous thing is that the 5 for a dollar samosas are really good. 
You would expect them to be no good because they are so cheap, but they really make them well.

Meat samosas are also available (3 for a dollar I think?)

One time, we had a few of the sweets they sell as well, they were fantastic. 
Next door there is a sit down restaurant, we have never been, but it looks nice. 

The only bad thing I would say about this place, is tamarind sauce costs extra."}
{"text":"Great place just started to go there their samos are great but only $1 for 5 and they are good too."}
{"text":"The spring rolls aren't that great. There's too much wonton wrap layers so they feel dense and chewy .They're not light and crispy. The line up here is soooo long.."}
{"text":"Embassy Restaurant is the reason why I am spoiled for Samosa's. Years of living in Scarborough and buying 5 Samosa's makes me go \"WTF!!?!\" when I go into other places and see Samosa's for a dollar per and over. Even more so than the fact that they are so cheap, the samosa's are really really good.  They have a nice size, they are usually really fresh. They are the right texture on the outside, slightly flaky, not too oily. They stuffing isn't over spiced, or bland.

They sweets they have are decent too. They have all of my favorites, Ras Malai, Gulab Jamun, Basan ki Baarfi (sp?). I don't eat their food very often. Usually it's just samosa's to go. People come in here and order like 200 of them. I know, I've seen it."}
{"text":"This place is a steal! For the very low price of $13.99 you can get 30... YES 30 Samosas, small butter chicken #delish and small biryani rice which is basically a medium in real life like McDonald's large in Canada vs U.S (restrictions apply. Only veggie samosa #sambosa 5/$1! Meat Samosa is 2/$1.00!) They have earn the title King!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness guys what happened? My go-to place for samosas and Indian sweets let me down last night and made us sick.

Ordered samosas for our movie date to see Jason Bourne at Cineplex, judge me if you must for sneaking in food haha, but I'm sure we've all done it before. $8.00-$12.00 on nachos, popcorn is not my thing. Grabbed a masala dosa, first time trying and headed back to the movie. Snuck in the food with no trouble, mazel tov!. 

However after eating the dosa and some samosas, halfway through the movie, my stomach started to disagree with me, then came the nauseousness, gassy stomach of mine that growled non-stop. Thank goodness I went to see an action movie, so no one heard the King Kong wrecking havoc in my abdomen. Couldn't finish the movie, had to find a washroom and went home to rest before I felt any worse. 

To dispute any doubt, I felt fine till eating from Samosa King. I don't want to have this experience again so I unfortunately won't be returning to Samosa King, exercise caution if you pickup food from here. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"This place is like the Dollarama for samosas. 

I usually come here when I want cheap, but delicious veggie samosas. Super crispy on the outside, flavourful and fresh on the inside. Get this - for $1.00, you get 5 samosas. Five. Really great value, especially for the quality of the samosas you're getting. I've often dropped by last minute before a family party to grab some additional appetizers. They usually dump the samosas into a brown bag for you, but I've requested the samosas to come in an aluminum tray, which they've never had a problem providing. This means that I've often walked into family parties with a massive aluminum tray of 40 samosas, which I only paid $8.00 for. Delicious, deep fried goodness, and almost always perfectly cooked.

I've also had the cassava chips and orders of veggie pakoras, both of which are also delicious. If you're okay with waiting 20-30 minutes during peak times, this is a good spot to grab some very reasonably priced appetizers or snacks."}
{"text":"What a great place for fresh baked indian goodies with a to-go options of several hot entrees such as dosas, curries, tandoor. The samosas are tasty but fried. I wish the had names as well to describe what each sweet item is. Bring cash or your debit card as they do not except any other option. I loved the chutneys  you must ask for it otherwise they do not offer it."}
{"text":"Samosa King has been here for ages, and yet, their prices still haven't raised for their food. 5 samosas, spring rolls, potato balls for $1, the rolls (has curry inside) are $0.75 each. Roti is $0.50 each. I love getting the curry here, veggie curry is a few dollars cheaper than the meat. Large curry is about $7-$8 for lamb meat. The lamb meat curry usually has more pieces of meat than the curry alone, and is delicious! My whole family and I purchase some bread/roti from supermarkets to finish the curry, which usually takes a few days. It's absolutely delicious!

There's two lines, one for hot food and the other for the fried goods/sweets. If you come here at night, it's usually a long wait ~20min. I came here once on the afternoon on a weekday and I did not have to wait at all for either line. The hot food line serves you the curry, curry with rice and the chicken (usually they let you purchase the roti and samosas in this line as well, but you can always line up, because I saw more items like the spring rolls that I liked as well. 

Samosa King should definitely plan to open another cash register, or hire one more employee. There were about 3 employees serving in the hot food line, one compiling the order for the cash register and one employee working the cash register. 

Amazing food, definitely worth the wait, I would rather come here than Babu up in Buroak and McCowan."}
{"text":"They definitely know what they are doing!A huge variety of Indian snacks, sweets and lunch items.

I got a few things and throughly enjoyed them.Very reasonably priced and the order line moves very fast irrespective of the long lines!

Good job in the running the show.The place is neat and clean which always is an added for family owned joints!

One suggestion would be to add an extra cash register to handle the long lines faster.

THEY ONLY TAKE CASH OR DEBIT!"}
{"text":"As an Indian, I have experienced indian take out. This is just like any other take out at any other indian restaurant. Nothing fascinated me. Only dip I faced was their horrible customer service. When entering, i quickly got in the line. However, they were taking orders of people behind me before taking mine. They did not take my order until 10 - 15 minutes in line. When they took the order they dont even talk to you. No eye contact. I get it, they could be tired or have had a long day. But at least respond to what I want so I don't get the wrong thing. In the end, you have to go back to the one cash counter where they announce your order and bill you. It can be chaotic because alot of others are waiting for their orders to be announced. There is no number system. They will say your entire order and what you got and if that is yours, you pick it up. If one can handle their horrible customer service and is there to eat indian food which tastes like any other indian take out then go for this place."}
{"text":"Yummmm! Their samosas are to die for! GUYS. I also had the rasmalai today, I'm not exactly sure what it is made with but it is a creamy sweet dessert and it's literally perfect (if you have a sweet tooth it's a must try!!!)

They have everything here from sweets to food to little things to munch on."}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG! I can't believe no one has reviewed Samosa King yet! This takeout/restaurant joint is like no other. Where can you find mouth watering samosa in the city for $1 for 5! No it's not a typo, that's right, 5 for $1!! So fresh and hot, right out of the deep fryer! 

The line up here can get ridiculous, so be prepared to stand in line for a bit. People come here mainly to take out food (samosa's being a staple, obviously), but there is a small dining room section (more often then not empty).   

Loyal customers buy samosas by the bag load, yet they never seem to run out, and if they do, a fresh batch is only a few minutes away! Not only do they have samosas but they have other indian appetizers, such as pakoras, roti and other deep fried treasures that i don't know the names to! Their Indian desserts are plentiful too, unfortunately I don't have much of a palate for the richness.  

If that wasn't enough, they also have a take out meal section (hot plate) with dishes like malai kofta, buttered chicken, and all the other favorites.  And a meal isn't a meal without good ol' naan! A real steal of a find, and it's a good sign when a lot of the clientele that go to Samosa King are of Indian Decent!"}
{"text":"Only tried the samosas but it was awesome!It was actually spicy unlike some other samosas I have tried in which was not spicy at all. The price was also very cheap. I got 10 samosas there for only $2 I think not certain but I remembered that it was very cheap. Great place to go to with a bunch of friends to grab a bite.There were also a lot of different kinds of food there I would like to try when I return next time."}
{"text":"My go-to for Indian food in Scarbaria. Food is dirt cheap and delicious. I always order their samosas and I really appreciate their daily special. I ordered the 3 vegetarian curry on rice and was very satisfied with it. Beware, the lineup can get out of hand during peak hours (around 5-6:30pm). I waited about an hour to order. 

Would definitely come again and recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Good stuff, but they really need to work out a better way to get people in and out of there. Came Sunday afternoon, and the lineup reached from one end of the store to the other end. Seeing as this place is at least two stores long, and their restaurant stretches out vertically, this says a lot. They have two lines: one for sweets and fried goods, and one for their hot table. Usually, when I go, I can line up in the hot food line and get both hot food and samosas. The hot food line is almost always shorter than the other line, so this usually saves me a lot of time. When I went this time, I was told that this wasn't an option. Perhaps he didn't understand my English? I'm not sure. Whatever it was, I waited in the long line (and I didn't bother getting my hot food). The lineup took me about 15-20 minutes? When I was paying, I looked back and the lineup was still at the other end of the restaurant. Yeah. There's a lot of people who like this place. There's a reason for it. Super cheap food.

All of these are $1 for 5: veggie samosas, aloo tikki, spring rolls (which taste just like every other vegetarian spring roll I've ever eaten), two types of vadai, potato balls (these are like spicy mashed potato balls that have been deep fried).

Veggie pakora (the only kind they had that day) are $4.99/lb. Theirs tastes primarily of onion, thus resulting in something I can only describe as the Indian version of onion ring shreds? Something like that. Delicious though. My little cousin doesn't do spicy, and she ate quite a few of these.

All in all, good food, but needs better, more efficient service. They also need to update their hot food menu."}
{"text":"The take out food was poor. Barely any chicken in the butter chicken, cartridge in the chicken fried rice, not enough meat all around in the meat dishes. Chicken samosas were cold, and the roti was too oily and thick. Customer service was poor as the staff didn't seem like they wanted to help or explain what certain items were. Overall only go here for the vegetarian samosas which are 5 for a $1 otherwise don't bother. Very over rated."}
{"text":"So I just went back today for some lunch and to give this food a real try,

and YES. They are serving magic here. I can confirm that.

Delicious, melt in your mouth, piping hot, burnt tongue, woops I ordered too much, Magic.

I walked in around 3pm and I was so relived to see that there was no line.

I ordered the Chicken Biryani, 1 roti and 10 samosas (I bought them to share, I promise)

1. The Biryani - when I looked at it, I thouht it wasn't going to be that great. But let me tell you, it was amazing. There was so much chicken hidden under the rice. It also came with a piece of tandoori chicken on top + a hard boiled egg. It was yum-oh!

2. The Samosas - THESE WERE THE MAGIC. Seriously. Magic. We got them fresh out of the fryer. The bag is still covered in oil. It steamed as we ate. My tongue is burnt. I couldn't stop. The filling was packed to the brim. I'm surprised it didn't burst open like a jack in the box. The toppings fell out of the samosa as I was eating because they were so packed. My shirt is dirty. I dont care. I'm in Samosa heaven.

Hands down, Samosa King is the best samosa's I've ever had in Toronto."}
{"text":"All hail my favourite samosas! Can I write a review on just samosas? Well, I'm going to try. (Actually, I have only tried the samosas here and I don't think that's going to change). Anways, in my opinion, samosas king has the best samosas around. I've been eating these forever and they're closeby so I just have to recommend them.

Okay, first thing off the bat, these samosas are rather tiny. One becomes two, two becomes three..and next you know, you've eaten ten. Afterall, they are 5 for a dollar so it does make sense. But in general, the amount of samosas you get per dollar is pretty consistent around these parts. A1 is also another favourite of mine, and it's pretty much the same goodness but bigger, so go there if you want larger samosas. 

The samosas are perfectly crispy, and with the pastry crust all bubbly you know it will be good (but extra heart-clogging..). Another good thing are that these samosas are not that oily either. I've seen some places where it's just drenched in oil and these samosas do not suffer from that.

I have only eaten the vegetarian potato ones and the filling is fantastic. It's flavourful and packed with spices, and it's not spicy at all. There's also peas in the filling, which gives it that nice hint of sweetness. I guess it's on the salty side but that's fine, you don't need to douse it in chutneys. They don't give you them anyways.. It tastes great with or without chutneys. 

Samosa king is indeed the king of samosas."}
{"text":"I've only bought samosas for parties here. They are delicious & a great price. This is the place to get your samosas! I'd love to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Have only ordered the vegetable samosas but wow!  They are truly tasty.
The line is out the door and around the corner on weekends and that means 50 people are in front of you.  But, it moves fast and well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I go here weekly. This place has great value for your dollar. I don't even think Ikea is as cheap. I will stock up on samosas and have two or three as a snack through out the week. 

Deals, deals and more deals! Things you should know:
- I think they are most famous for their samosas, at least this is how I can to know them; 5 samosas for $1!
- But since going regularly and not being as intimidated as I was the first time, I have since discovered the Toonie Tuesdays and Fridays. You can get an order of either plain idlis, plain dosas, rice with three veg curries or fried rice. Each only costing you $2! 
-They have other deals on other days, but I don't go to them or at least don't order them so you'll have to go to check it all out. 

They accept cash (obviously) but if you want debit their is an additional charge of $0.30 if your order is under $10. That is my understanding anyways, I haven't actually asked the logistics of it, but that is what I get from watching others pay. And they don't accept credit, at least not in the take-out section. (maybe in the dine in area... I can't recall). 

I would recommend:
- Pedas & milk cakes. These are my favourite desserts. 
- Try the deals mentioned above. 
- Dhoklas (they are the yellow looking squares)

Another great thing is that they are open late. You can get good deals until 11pm! That works for me!"}
{"text":"There was a massive line.... People were being moved along super fast and everyone looked as though they had been here many many times before. It was my first time and goodness me im so glad i gave it a shot, even though after trying mostly everything i discovered im not so much a fan of samosas and other bready fried treats that i tried, when i got home with everything and got into the chicken curry and roti..... Mind .... Blown.... It was so freeking good that if im ever in that area again i will seek it out and get a much larger serving. I was emotionally distraught when i finished eating it all, i was so sad it was finished. There will be a second (and third , and so on) visit in my future. My body requires this. Not to mention EVERYTHING was super amazimgly priced, you could feed a big group of people from this place on a tiny budget. You want this, you need this, ...... Go here !"}
{"text":"Go for the rasmalai. Rest can be ok or just good. 
However the queue is too tragic. Process is you have to stand in a queue to move up to the teller and then get someone, who will walk back with you (from behind the counter) to the area where you started to pick up sweets and snacks and then again go back to teller (this time you don't have to stand in a queue) to pay for the order. Its too chaotic.  
They could have had a system like any other food joint, go to the counter, order what you want, pay for it and wait for someone to hand out your order in a package."}
{"text":"I remember coming here a really long time ago. My friend brought me here and I had no idea where she was driving from so I was surprised to see this plaza is actually located close to Middlefield. I remembered she told me she was a little bit worried about the parking there  because she heard a lot of cars got hit so I was a little bit worried. In the end, there was nothing to worry about since I came at the right time at around 11:15 ish a.m. which the mall was not crazy busy yet. When I got there, there was not much of a lineup and service was quick. The entrance is located on the furthest right.

First, a must have is the samosas, their 5 for $1 vegetarian Samosas, which is possibly the best deal of all and yes, even if they are smaller samosas. You do get a choice to request the Samosas to be put in a aluminum container to keep them warm and toasty. However it is an additional charge of 1.50.

I also wanted to get some Roti but they were not ready yet so i was kind of disappointed because it was like close to the 12 pm lunch rush. How can they not be ready or available yet?!?

I decided to also get butter chicken after seeing some reviews but I guess I shouldn't have as I was very disappointed with the product   They told me it comes in two sizes: small for $4.99 and $8.99 for the bigger size so I said okay sure, I'll get the bigger size but I was a little surprised by the size container that was presented to me, which was basically a styrofoam that was pretty much like a bigger container for bowl of soup. I really expected more for the price I was paying at $8.99.  The sauce actually ended up leaking out in the bag too. (Maybe the lid wasn't properly closed?). Definitely won't be getting this any time soon as it just tasted ok and wasn't the best.

 I got also pakoras and was surprised they were now selling it for $4.99 pound instead of by unit. I was told I could buy half a pound so I did that.

Overall, a must go to place if u love Indian food and sweets and don't mind the line ups."}
{"text":"These people don't care even a litle bit about customer service!!!  When I kindly requested the fresh batch of samosas (after waiting for the new batch), the person behind the counter literally told me, \"I've been doing this for 20 years. Everyone asks this. Take it or leave it.\" So I left it.  So if you want to be treated horribly after waiting in line for a really long time, go here. =D"}
{"text":"I will speak for Jalebis, Samosas and some of the other heart attack inducing fried items that i got from there.

The only thing going on for this place is cheap prices. Samosa were filled with onions instead of meat, Jalebi tasted weird and all the other items had too much bason (gram flour) and less actual stuff.
Friendly people behind the counter, but no, this is not the best samosa in scarborough, not even close."}
{"text":"Probably the best place in town to get quality samosas for a super cheap price of $1 for 5. Despite other reviewers that spoke of the long line, I came during the afternoon and was in and out of Samosa King in 5 minutes tops.

When I got the samosas, they were still hot and it tasted delicious!! The samosa skin was not too thick and the filling had just the right amount of heat. A must-buy for anyone who visits Samosa King!

I did minus one star because I also got the spring rolls--another awesome deal that gives you 5 for $1--and the server got it from the heated food area but when I took a bite into the spring roll, it was cold!! Not even warm or cool but COLD! Very deceiving to have it in the heated food area and it's cold. I may reconsider when I order again next time. 

Regardless, I will be back for more samosas!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing the commercial - 5 samosas for $1 from fellow Yelpers, i decided to make a stop on a cold, snowy afternoon. As I walked into this place, it was busy with a long line! They had assortment of treats in a glass box and I carefully walked pass all across them (ignoring my temptation to buy them!) to order my samosas. 

I walked in with $3 - I got 10 samosas and one roll ($.75) : a real deal if you ask me. Roll was delicious, samosa was good but I felt it had more dough than curry. I am not complaining as it was pretty inexpensive. 

They sell plethora of indian sweets here and you can get some pretty boxes too. I would love to pick some up for gifts next time. These guys may be samosa kings but do check out the other edibles too.

P.S- Take cash. They take credit cards over $10"}
{"text":"Take out only, no sit down.  Great food on a budget but definitely fast-food.  Kinda tough for the uninitiated white boy, but I'm sure you'd get the hang of it.

The menus are on video screens behind the counter and rotate *very* quickly - I couldn't really read the menu.

The food was just OK.  Greasy and barely warm.  They were out of all but the vegetarian samosas (9:30 pm on a Thursday) so I skipped that."}
{"text":"Where else can you get delicious samosas - 5/$1?  Yup you read that right.  An institution from way back in the day in Scarborough  this place is going strong.  Known for their samosas that is what I usually get - veggie with spice - nothing is better than biting into that flaky outside.  This time I also got a pound of pakora.  Fried deliciousness is what that is.  For 15 samosas and a pound of pakora plus sauce came up to about $9 with tax.  Can't argue with that price.

They also have all varieties of sweets (an entire long counter of sweets - barfi, jalebi, etc ) and meals that you can order or place an order for catering (which a lot of people do).  Check the menu board for lunch specials.

Located in a strip plaza in Scarborough this place is busy from when it opens up at 9am til when it closes at 11pm.  Plenty of parking in the back so don't worry if the front lot is filled.  Being some patience as well b/c inside where you order/pay is a bit confusing and crowded.

I don't believe they take credit card - just cash/debit."}
{"text":"5 samosas for $1!!! 

Who's saying no to that deal?? (My mom that's who!- haha) 

I mean I'm not going to just drive up to finch and middlefield for samosas but if you're in the area getting your eyebrows waxes/threaded in the weekday then stop by... I wouldn't suggest the weekends because the lines quite frankly are absurd. It's like 20 people deep and ordering $40 worth of samosas... Smh 

I've tried the butter chicken and briyani, nothing to scream about besides the prices! 


holla"}
{"text":"Good food, cheap price. The samosas are especially tasty. 
My only issue is the whole ordering process. Its a little weird when most times there are two separate lines."}
{"text":"i tried this place since it was so close from the bf's place and all the amazing reviews & cuz im looking for an amazing indian restaurant that i can call my favorite indian restaurant .

- their veggie samosas are soo good and i dont even like samosas . their wrap is a bit different, more pastrylike than others that ive tried .
- butter chicken was amazingg ! it tasted exactly like what it sounds like . buttery sauce with juicy chicken pieces . must try !
- mattar paneer . i only got this because of the review below mine . i never had anything like it before and it was different but in a good way . the little blocks of cheese seemed weird at first, but it goes so well together . must try if you want something different .

i LOVED their dessert section .
- milkbread was sooo sweet . maybe too sweet but thats what dessert are suppose to be ! the more you eat, the better it gets ! my fav out of all 3 !
- white pedas . this was different . i thought i didnt like it at first but the most i ate it, the more it tasted like condensed/evaporated milk . by the second piece, i really liked it .
- ras malaii . i also got this because of the review below mine . its not like anything ive ever tried before ! its a cheese ball in white liquid . its worth a try !


one of my most favorite thing in the world is trying out completely new/different food & flavors . samosa king provided me that by plenty ! i cant quite give a 5 star since i havent tried a lot of other south indian places, but this is my fav so far !"}
{"text":"Awesome snacks ,sweets and cheap eats.only issue is be prepared for long line all the time"}
{"text":"A one-stop take-out shop for your Indian-hot-food-and-sweets fix. As others have raved, they offer five samosas for a $1. The problem is, they are often stale - so watch out for that, my friends. 

Biryani dishes, roti & curries, many vegetarian options for take-out...your head will spin at the selection. For convenience and variety, this neighbourhood staple is hard to beat.

The impressive sweets counter is definitely my favourite. Picked up a pound of almond burfi for $3.99! Yum!"}
{"text":"It's apparent that somehow my experience here differs drastically from others. I don't now where I or the King went wrong but somehow things just didn't work out. Perhaps I was a little late to the game or maybe my expectations were way too high or maybe we just didn't understand each other.

The samosa's are fresh! And....that's about it. The crust tastes great but the filling definitely needs some work (or maybe just a bit more of it). To plainly put it, I've had much better and I've definitely had much worst. As of the rest of the other stuff I am not sure why anyone would want to eat. The biryani is wrong(I know, I know it's an Indian joint but I was craving it that night!), chicken tika is strange and curry chicken is....just confusing. The paneer marsala is paneer-less. Ironically, the only saving grace is something that's not even inheritantly Indian -- butter chicken and even that was subpar. One thing they do have in common though is that they are all salty like the ocean. I can't comment on the sweets as I didn't try them (and neither was anyone which is confusing as they had tons of them).

If you are starving and really can't think of anything to eat AND you are too poor for McDonald's then you will absolutely enjoy saving a few bucks here."}
{"text":"Embassy/Samosa King..been going to this place since 1995 so I do have a soft spot for this place. If you're looking for a tasty and authentic indian/south indian take out place, welcome to Samosa king! Cheap and delicious samosa which are 5 for $1. Not too big either, two bite samosas  I would say. The samosas are vegetarian and always hot and fresh.
Huge line ups and that's the only downside to this spot. I can go during the weekday or weekends and the line up is always so long! 
I also found a new love- Masala Chai! One of the best Masala Chai's in town. 
Overall, great place for sweets, breakfast, snacks, everything you could ask for is here.
Tips: Bring cash
-Be patient as there are always long wait times here"}
{"text":"Living within a 15-20 min drive from here ever since I was a kid. Love when my dad would pick up some samosas especially for an afternoon snack. Still $1 for 5 today which is amazing, because of how crispy and delicious they are. They aren't small and they don't skimp out on the filling (potatoes, peas) either! Even after the drive home, they are still super crispy! Their roti is okay, and pakoras can be more fresh. Other than that, this is my go-to spot for great tasting samosas that are a bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"When you get 5 samosas for a buck I don't think you should be questioning how good they taste. I'm pretty sure samosas in India are around the same price if not more expensive. Be prepared to stand in line though as Embassy is really popular. I saw people in the line picking up as many as 40 samosas. I got the regular vegetarian samosas, chicken samosas, onion pakoda and a chilli pakoda all of which were really cold and tasted kind of crap except for the vegetarian samosa. I guess thats the only thing that gets made fresh. Not the best samosa I;ve had but probably the cheapest food I've bought in Canada and that includes cup noodles. The only problem is my friend threw up right after eating them. I'm not sure if it was in his mind or if the samosas were bad but thats what happened."}
{"text":"When I think about getting Samosas, Samosa King is pretty much the only shop that comes to mind.  There is always a line up but the line moves quick so I've never waited for more than 5-10 minutes.  Delicious and cheap at 5 vegetable samosas for $1.  They taste great even cold!  At Samosa King, they also have meat samosas as well as a variety of other food items and desserts.  That being said, when I am in the shop, I head straight for the samosas."}
{"text":"I had their samosas at a party last night and they are just fingerlickingly awesome. Best samosas I have had...even better than some places in India."}
{"text":"Samosas are awesome.

Tonight I had 3 different vegetable curry & rice for $2 and I had enough for dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow. 

AJ had the butter chicken & rice for about $10

Green chutney is also super tasty."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered the 5 for a buck samosas from this place, and have been back several times. The samosas are consistently good, crisply on the outside and perfectly moist and spicy on the inside.  I picked up 60 yesterday as I was hosting a party, and they went in no time.  They keep well in the fridge and are easy to reheat, keeping their crispy texture.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've only tried their samosas but they have a variety of sweet and savory. 5 samosas for $1 is just insane. The wrap was crunchy and the filling has just the right amount of spice... my friend went around 5 on a Saturday and line up was just impossible so we came back at 11pm literally minute before they closed (lucky us)!"}
{"text":"This is the best value place anywhere this side of the 404 for fresh, tasty and cheap samosas, sweets and other Indian snacks, treats and food. I love coming here for the value. I hate coming here for the line up. 

You'll get 5 samosas for $1 (as many as you want) and same for spring rolls. Chicken samosas are available for 2 for $1. They also have a ton of sweets and treats to choose from as well as hot and cold lunch/dinner items like butter chicken, chicken biryani, paneer, rice, spinach, korma, etc. Lots of veg and non-veg selections.

The only thing wrong with this place is a) parking is a nightmare. Park far away near the back and you'll be fine from almost getting hit by the plethora of terrible drivers. B) the line up for samosas, sweets and other fried/baked stuff is long. Expect to wait 15min minimum up to 45min if it's really really busy. 

Pro tip, the got food line is a separate line and if you order anything hot (let's say $5 to $10 worth) you can get those guys to get your samosas for you."}
{"text":"This place is extremely overhyped. I was here and saw the huge line, so it seems they have some people who think their food is worth this gigantic wait.

They are pretty cheap, which might be a reason why people like them, but everything from them tasted pretty bad. Their samosas were bready and didn't have a satisfying crunch as seen from other samosas I have tasted. They were out of meat and chana (chickpea) samosas, but I was able to try the veggie samosas, which were priced at 5 for $1.00. (Which is pretty cheap) They were ok, and had a nice spicy taste. I was also able to try their $0.50 plain roti, which tasted similarily to naan.

The goat curry was spicy and decent overall. I did bite into cardamom when eating it, leaving an overpowering taste in my mouth.

This place was disappointing on multiple levels, even with the better than average pricing."}
{"text":"Consistantly good south Indian food. Not much else in the neighbourhood that is as good.

The curry chicken is saucy, and could use some more chicken, but it's delicious, and nicely spicy. 

The spinach and paneer here is really good, one of my favourite dishes when done right. 

They have a very large counter with plenty of baked goods, sweets, and other dry items like samosa and pakora. There's so much to choose from in their dry counter that it's almost daunting to even look at."}
{"text":"So - been here before for samosas but never thought of delving into the hot table where they serve up a great selection of curries and rice variations - so I partook (and did I ever). 

Guys, I got a take out container (stuffed with 3 different variations of vegetarian curries. I also ordered 10 amazingly delicious samosas and 2 roti. Grand total? $6.50 after tax. I can eat for 3 days for that!

The food is delicious. The wait can be long but I truthfully don't understand how the hell they can stay in business for that price. If the quality of the food was poor then I'd certainly understand. But it's delicious and I mean really delicious. 

Kudos to these guys for making awesome food, for stupidly cheap prices and making an amazing living off of it. I will be back and back and back again."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving for samosa this is my go to place. The price is right 5 for $1 you can't go wrong. They also have a lot of sweets and other items to chose from. They recently added spring roll also 5 for $1. I been to many places for samosa and this place is really good."}
{"text":"This my go-to place for samosas and spring rolls. They are always freshly made, hot, crispy, flaky, and delicious! At 5 for $1.00, you can't beat that deal!!! Apparently, everybody knows that because they're always busy and you could be waiting in line up to 30 minutes during peak periods. It's worth the wait!

I've also tried their pakoras, tandoori chicken, butter chicken and some of their vegetarian dishes. All are good, although I've had tastier versions of the latter two, but nowhere near the prices they offer here.

I once ordered 400 spring rolls and 150 samosas and they were able to have it ready for pickup with only a couple of hours notice. Try them!"}
{"text":"I'm new to scarborough & a friend recommended this place. She told me it was affordable (it was so cheap), & she told me they had snacks, samosas, parathas and a few food items too (they also had mithai & other sweets). She didn't warn me about the delishious smells that fill the air when you pull into the parking lot though. It was a freezing February evening around 6pm. The place was pretty crowded but the line moved quickly. So it's takeout only and after work it's almost always crowded. Hard-to-find-a-parking-space crowded. I got the samosas (tiny puffy things), some kulfi (tiny white things) & some jalebi (fat orange sweet stuff). I would've tried something else but nothing was labeled and the boys behind the counter had a polite but no-nonsense \"please don't be one of THOSE customers who ask me costs & ingredients\" look to them. Super affordable. I'm not a samosa freak but couldn't resist the warm spicy smells in the car: had like 5 little samosas on my ride back home. They were that good."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area I grab a whole lot of samosas here. At 5 for $1 they are a steal, and chutneys are $0.25 for sweet and $0.50 for spicy, with larger sizes available though I've never gotten them. They also do spring rolls 5 for $1 and have a huge selection of fried foods, sweets, and savoury snacks. Also, they have a hot food section that has a separate line up, which does curries, biryanis, rotis, etc. Today I decided to try the 3 veg curries with basmati rice for $2.49 and I have to say it was a pretty good deal. They let you choose from about 6 or 7 different vegetarian curries. I had the daal, spinach, and mixed vegetables, all three were good. The spinach had a bit of a burnt flavour to it, which I think was intentional. 
Came Friday afternoon at around 1:30pm and barely had to wait which is a plus! I've been when the line up is nearly to the door, and the wait time is still reasonably fast. Because this place is so cheap and popular, samosas are super fresh!"}
{"text":"I just came here and ordered dosa, idli and apparently cold pakora. After witnessing people who ordered 15mins after me get their food, i inquired how much longer it would be.  Apparently they can  stretch 3-4mins over 20mins. Its a skill that is impressive but extremely irritating. 

If you're getting something from the lukewarm section, this is the place for you, but if you're expecting quality service and try again my friend. All in all I'm left feeling empty inside... It's a good price however I don't think it's worth the poor service"}
{"text":"I echo previous reviews.....where else can you get decent samosa for such a great price.
I took off a star due to the antiquated order system they have in place. When I arrived (early afternoon), there were 3 people in front of me.....by the time I got to the counter (perhaps 5 minutes later), the lineup was almost out the door.
Samosa were fresh, full of flavour and very reasonably priced. 
Great !"}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap Indian take-out, Samosa King is the place to go!  There can be a long line because people are lining up for their samosas and other fried food. 

They have 5 samosas for $1.  They put it in a paper bag and the grease soaks up the bottom of the bag.  The size of the samosa isn't that big, but what can you ask for, you can't find samosas for cheaper elsewhere.  

Tandoori chicken is $3 each.  Nicely flavoured. 

Daily special: three veggies plus rice for $2.49.  I wanted aloo gobi but they ran out.  They have about six veggie dishes to choose from.  I got chick peas, spinach and I don't know the name of the other veggie.  The veggies tasted good, however, the rice was a bit hard. 

They have a wide selection of desserts.  I'll def come back to check this out!"}

The samosas are an extremely good deal! As other yelpers have mentioned, you get 5 samosas for only $1. The best part is that they haven't raised the prices for as long as I've been buying them. There is also other Indian snacks for sale as well as take out meals and desserts. I also got the daily special that is 3 veggie curries with basmati rice. I personally didn't enjoy that due to the spices being too overwhelming.  

Overall score: 3/5"}
{"text":"Indian-Sri-Lankan fusion. Spicy, busy..

Take-out only

The curries are well prepared, especially lamb curry was yummmm.. Huge variety of snacks - both sweet and spicy.

If I was a person watching oil intake, I'd stay away. But I guess most Indian dishes are oily."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price.  Love the hot food bar here.  The best Quality for price in the area."}
{"text":"Went to this joint, looks clean and lots of choices, takeout only.
The food was cheap but not very tasty or fresh.

Got the butter chicken and rice,
No place to sit and eat so we got it to go. They would not even supply any plastic utincils.

Also wanted to sample a small piece of a Ladoo (sweets) before buying, they would not offer me a free sample. So I bought a sample for 50 cents, wasn't impressed with the taste.

I've eaten a lot of indian food(I am of Indian origin) and this was one of the worst.  I think you need to head out to Brampton to find good Indian food.

I also think the staff could be a bit more friendlier."}
{"text":"Trekked out of the city to find this place. It is purely a take out place. It's important to know what the food is before you get there as we had no idea and a nice girl in line explained it to my friend and I. 

Ordered samosas (good), these fried dough doughnut shaped crispy things (delicious) and pakoras (delicious, but very crispy). Everything seemed to be veggie (GOOD FOR VEGETARIANS). The pink samosa sauce was delicious. 

They had entire cases of Indian desserts too. Everything comes in brown paper bags."}
{"text":"I love Samosa king for a variety of reasons.

#1 - 5 samosas for $1. This is the reason I originally discovered this place. While it's not the best samosa in toronto, it's a very good one in my opinion and the long long LONG lines on any given afternoon (especially Fridays) will prove it to you. 
#2 - daily specials. $1 for 3 rotis? WOW! Curry Fridays! Yum!
#3 - variety - SO........... MANY.......... THINGS........ TO........... CHOOSE.......... FROM.....!!!!!
desserts / curries / breads / samosas / sauces / hot dishes / and a lot of other things that I don't know what they're called but they all look good! And I must add, good quality too! 

and lastly #4 - awesome prices! The best place for cheap indian takeout!"}
{"text":"The famous samosa king amongst the Scarborough population. Everyone knows about the $1 for 5 samosas that why the line up is always soooo long.

It's only a take out place. Came during noon on sat the line up was huge. Even for the food. I ordered a chicken biryani and it was a good portion with sauce. Ordered 2 roti but it was very chewy I think too much dough. Also got a kabob 2 for $3. The kabob you can pass. 

Wanted to get the samosas but the line up was at least 30 mins . So forget it they also have 3 veggie 1 curry deal for $2.50 but I've never tried it."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to get samosas for a potluck or party! To echo what everyone has said, you can't go wrong for 5 for $1 samosas!

I decided to try this place after reading many positive reviews the day before.  I got there (on a Saturday afternoon just after lunch), and there was a lineup of approximately 15 people.  I probably waited in line for about 10 minutes at least; however, the service was very quick.

I ordered 50 samosas and two rolls (to try).  I didn't have to pre-order nor did I have to wait long because the samosas just kept coming out of the kitchen.  Many other customers seemed to have ordered a whole bunch as well.

Someone had mentioned in their review that it was like a samosa nazi...like the soup nazi, and I totally felt that way too! After I got my samosas and paid for them and walked off, I felt like I couldn't go back to ask them for sauce. It was okay though, because they tasted good on their own as well.

I love how these samosas aren't the thin pastry shells that you would get at other places.  The samosas at Samosa King are thick and bready, and they have just the right amount of spices/kick.  The rolls were good, but they were much spicier than the samosas. I believe the rolls were 75 cents each.  

The samosas are placed in paper bags and then a plastic bag because of the oil seeping through.  If you are throwing a party then make sure you have a tray to serve them in!

I would definitely come back here to try their other dishes as well. I can't believe I didn't hear about this sooner!"}
{"text":"I came here for the samosas. You can get 5 of these veggie potato pockets for $1, and I usually get 40-60 at a time. They're of good proportions and are STUFFED with delicious potato filling.

Have five for a snack. Have 15 or 20 if you're really hungry. With all that filling, it's practically a full meal for under $5 dollars.

On my last visit, I also grabbed a chicken biryani for $6.99 and a veggie biryani for my vegetarian partner for $4.99.

Both were really delicious! There are several layers of spice with every bite, and the chicken was tender and delicious. My spice tolerance is low, and I found the biryani by default had the perfect amount of heat for me. I didn't cry or sniffle once, but it gave my tongue a nice zing.

Overall, definitely give this place a shot. It gets really busy, but their popularity is a testament of how good they are. It's a little out of the way for me, but for the price and the quality of their food, it's always worth stopping by."}
{"text":"The line was really long on a Saturday afternoon but the food is cheap and delicious. A large curry lasted me two meals."}
{"text":"Am not sure about the sweet. But in terms of Bryani,it's so disgusting.. really bad !!! Am not sure if mine was old or what! But I had the worst Indian food in my life... butter chicken is like tomato with chicken.. really really bad"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite samosas. I love them because even though they're machine made, they still taste like they're hand made. And you are almost always guaranteed to get fresh ones because they have such a high samosa turnover. The samosas are also one of the more spicier ones you can find. You also can't beat the 5 for $1 price.

Pro Tip: Their Masala Chai is also pretty great, especially if you like lattes ( it's pretty heavy on the milk )"}
{"text":"I would've given this place 4 stars if I came here only once. However, after coming here several times, I noticed some things I don't like about them. Aside from the samosa deal, I wouldn't come here for their dinner dishes (e.g., butter chicken, saag paneer). Although their dishes are delicious (but very salty), they're very stingy with the meat! I love soaking up my roti with curry but I like my beef and chicken too! If the prices were low (which they're not!), I would understand why they're stingy with the meat. With the prices they have, I can get one and half Chinese take out dishes with more substance than one of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Best place for Somosas in north scarb. No one can beat their price (5 for $1 - veg kind). Amazing selection of sweets. Good quality imo. There's always many customers so the food is moving = fresh. My only complaint is the consistency of the heat level of the somosas. Sometimes they're are very mild other times they have more heat added that a person who doesn't eat pepper wouldn't be able to handle them."}
{"text":"Samosa King is a well-known landmark in Scarborough.  It's ridiculous how long the lines are, but it's worth the wait and the prices are awesome!  Our family and friends have been coming here for samosas over the last 10 years.  

Attached to Samosa King is Embassy Restaurant, which - In the past year - I've visited once. Had the malai kofta and the gulab jambu for dessert and both were pleasant.  

You're paying a few extra bucks if you're sitting down at Embassy, so might as well go for the doggy bag next door."}
{"text":"Embassy Restaurant aka \"Samosa King\" got really popular during the \"samosa wars\" when they introduced their 5 samosas for $1 a while back when everyone else were offering 2 or 3 for $1 at the time....Being a cheap ass, of course that peaked my interest along with half of Scarborough/Markham!   We've been going for years since then to this place.

Lineups go out the door during holidays but it moves fast so not too long of a wait.   The samosas have gotten smaller over the years so the 5 for $1 is more like others 2 for a $1 so don't be swayed by the numbers:).  

They also sell decent Indian sweets along with other snacks as well as a hot table.  I wouldn't say they make the best stuff but everything they do is pretty solid and decent.

Great place to check out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"When I get my eyebrows done next door - I pop in here for their 5 samosas for $1... you can't go wrong!
I haven't tried their other dishes however they have a whole display counter is desserts that look \"interesting\" to me but I'm not educated on Indian Desserts - but I'm sure they are good because they go quickly as well. 

Definetely worth the stop in for Samosas though"}
{"text":"Cheap?  5/$1 Samosas = HELL YES!  Delicious, memorable, drive out-of-my-way for?  No, not really.

Samosas weren't hot, so be prepared to toaster oven them at home.  Filling was spicy, which is fine, potato is chopped up into tiny cubes, and it also came with peas.  Lotsa 'space' inside and corners of shell of samosa was thick - I don't like thick wrapping and obviously would prefer a bit more filling.

So contrary to the rave reviews, I was sorta disappointed with the product.  I've had better even in Mississauga, but obvi they weren't 5/$1!  :((( 

Establishment itself was very clean though and there was A LOT more than just samosas!"}
{"text":"Good but I wish their menu was a little more detailed. I couldn't really tell how much samosas were and I stayed in that line for awhile. Samosas was very good but I've had better. It may just be my tastebuds but I would assume this is the \"authentic\" samosa. Overall veggie samosa was good...Good. Nothing more."}
{"text":"A coworker recommended this place for samosas, which she brought to work and I thought they were delicious!! $1 for 5 samosas... Wow. What a deal! The samosas are not the biggest I've had in Toronto but the vegetarian filling is flavourful and spicy! There was a line to get them though. Maybe we waited 20 min. There are other items available including dosa and roti but we only ordered the samosas for take out. The spicy or sweet sauce was $1. Other places include these sauces for free but the samosas are so cheap, doesn't seem to matter. Takes only debit or cash!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with $1 for 5 veggie samosas! 
My go to place for samosas as it's always made fresh and warm when I buy them! Service is fast and efficient.

I love their beef and chicken samosas. They are $1 for 2 which is really affordable."}
{"text":"Whenever I don't have time to cook for potluck, this is the place I will go for Samosa.  It's cheap and good!!  Always long lineup.  Their mitten roll is good too but a bit too spicy for me.  Should try their curry, u will love it."}
{"text":"This is a crazy crazy place. I lost my head for a while. So many things, so many!

Its the best place in North Toronto to grab bites for a party. Very economical but well, quality is just ok.

5 samosas for a dollar aren't a bad deal but just like Mirchi Pakoda (batter fried chillies), batter has a prominent taste than the fillings. Kachoris are to die for though.

Also took some Aloo Bondas and Gulab Jamuns. Only caveat is that in absence of any sitting arrangement, you gotta get a take out only. Otherwise I'm sure they'll need a food court to fit people in."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a colleague for the samosas.   Food okay and inexpensive...but service unfriendly. Maybe because I am a women and asked a lot of questions but staff was dismissive  and the place was empty!  Looking for another Indian takeout."}
{"text":"It's really busy here. The line-up order/pay process is awful. People mainly come here for the samosas and sweets. 

It is a \"restaurant,\" but it's food is alright and somewhat cold. I have not tried their sweets.

The samosas, however, are pretty good for the PRICE. Warm, reasonably sized and packed well with food. A bit oily. At five samosas for $1, it is very good. For the samosas themselves, I would give four stars, possibly five. The price may be influencing my taste buds."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best place for samosa's and for the value (5 for $1), you cannot go wrong. The roti is not bad either, I was a little surprised when I got my order for chicken roti because you don't get the roti skin like a wrap, it is cut up and mixed and tastes great. Their potato balls are ok, but Babu's potato balls are much better. 

Pros: Good food, great value.

Cons: Parking can be impossible to find; line ups can be forever. Hate being behind the guy who orders 300 samosa's cause then you will have to wait for a few batches until you can get yours."}
{"text":"i cant believe i forgot to review samosa king while i was in toronto. 
every time i go back to toronto, i head to samosa king at least once. their veggie samosas are to die for!!

FIVE SAMOSAS FOR A DOLLAR!! you can't beat that. i generally dont like veggie samosa but i can definitely eat two dollars worth of it right there.
I always get the mint chutney to go with it; it is deliciously spicy to the core.

If you are interested in getting the chicken samosa, i believe it's $2.50 for five, which is still cheap, but i have to say the veggies are better.

If you go on a busy day on the weekend, the line could stretch across the entire store, with ppl asking for 50 samosas at a time. worth the wait though. most of the time i go, the line is about four or five people and they are super fast. 

the front half of the restaurant is dedicated to take out, which includes not just samosas, but indian desserts and yummy curry, dosa, all your staple north and south indian food. there's a corner in the back for sit down ordering, ive never been there myself.

i can't wait to go back to eat some more!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place 4 stars, but the service when we went there was terrible.  Like what i said before, you can have the best food in the world but if service sucks you might as well have failed.

It was our first time to visit this samosa place.  I've heard a lot of good things about their samosa and how they are super cheap.  It wasnt busy when we came and there was three employees manning the counter and not one of them even greeted us (strike one).  When they finally decided to acknowledge us, we asked for a large container of butter chicken and ten samosas.  As we were in the process of paying, the cashier was too preoccupied on the phone (strike two).  And when we finally paid for the food, we waited another 5 min to get the food we just paid for(strike three).  It took atleast 20 min to buy one butter and 10 samosas.  Talk about bad service and it wasnt even BUSY!

The samosa were good, little bit size gems. Just enough spices and perfect portions.  And also a good price for 5 pieces for a dollar.  The butter chicken was really good. Creamy, velvety and spicy enough for me. It was a little bit pricy though.

I would go back again just to see whether the experience we had today was just a one off"}
{"text":"The vegetable samosas are very cheap but flavourful. The one thing I love most about this place is the vast variety and selection of food. The mutton rolls are to die for, the kick of the cumin within the potato and the spices are on point."}
{"text":"On a weekday afternoon, there was only 5 people waiting in front of me waiting for some samosas. The line moved super fast and gave me some time to admire all the sweets that is so pretty and colourful but not good for me...

$1 for 5 Samosas and I mixed that with $1.25 Pakora. So I ended up with 4 Samosas and 3 Pakora for $1.25.. I really don't know why.. Personally I enjoyed the $1/2 Chicken Samosas a lot better... Maybe I am just a big spender!

Great as a snack! Maybe I get some extra ones to go with my beers next time.

Life is good if I can still get some food for a dollar."}
{"text":"Samosa King is totally the King. If you're anywhere near this place, you have to stop by and grab their samosas. We used to stock up and serve them at parties, because they're so so so cheap (yes, you can get 20 samosas for $4) and probably the best samosas I've ever eaten in my life.

The line-up is usually out the door, especially on weekends, but it moves fast and the guy at the cash register is hilarious. Every time I've been there he's cracked some silly joke and I've left the store laughing. 

Their take-out food is great too. I wouldn't recommend sitting down and eating here because most of their staff are working the take-out line. Just grab some of their butter chicken and samosas and bring it home. 

They've also got a HUGE selection of Indian desserts in all sorts of bright colours and the ones that I've been daring enough to try have been delicious. This place is amazing in every way, just make sure you stick to take-out and you'll love it, just like everyone in Scarborough already does.

Note on the parking lot -- it's madness on weekends, and people will just park their car wherever they feel like it, even if it blocks you from getting out. Park far away and save yourself from getting trapped!"}
{"text":"Who gives a shit load of amazing food for less than 5 bucks these days and not to mention 5 samosas for $1 which actually taste pretty good. Huge variety of sweets and Indian snacks to choose from. Not a dine-in place but who cares when the food is so good and reasonable. Unpretentious food at modest prices - always 5 stars."}
{"text":"Samosa King is possibly the best place for retrieving food for potluck. You can easily feed an army for $10 worth of samosa ($1 for 5 vegetable samosa filled with potato, onion, pea, coriander, lentil and spices). My friends who had moved away from Scarborough had often complained about being lost for potluck without Samosa King in their life. 

Thali starts at $4.49, slightly on the \"salt-licking\" side. Masla Dosa is $3.99 - very economical compared to Saravanaa Bhavan nearby. Quality is on par. 

Definitely a great option if you are on a budget or when you have to feed an army!"}
{"text":"What should you get at Samosa King? SAMOSAS obviously ;)
They have the best samosas in the area, both quality and price. The price has been the same for many years 5 samosas for $1. 
Samosa King is the best in the east end. In the west end, there's \"Samosa & sweets factory\" which is also 5 for $1, similar quality or maybe a bit better than samosa king IMO.
There's always a line up at Samosa King, be prepared to wait. Their other indian dishes are decent as well. I have yet tried their sweets so I can't comment on that. 

Highly recommend this place for samosas ;)"}
{"text":"Take out only.  Bring cash or use Canadian debit/credit card.  I've been looking for a place that sells all sorts of Indian eats!  This place has it all.  Samosa, roti, naan, curry, biryani all the fun snacks sold from vendor cards to small setups in Mauritius and India!  I was in heaven picking and chosing.  I was a little taken that they didn't have a spicy sauce offering for the roti and their green chili was a little weak on heat.  I think I bought enough for a family of 4 and paid under $20.  Amazing.  4 stars only because of it being take-out only and this deal with not taking out of country credit cards."}
{"text":"I love this place so, so much. Awesome Indian food for super low prices. $1 for 5 veggie samosas? Sweet Jesus. You could come here with a ten dollar bill and invite all your friends to share with you. (Unless you wanted to eat them all yourself. I would.)

You would think there would be some kind of catch. Is it so cheap because it's mediocre? No friggin' way. You're getting amazing tasting stuff for an equally amazing price. You cannot beat this restaurant."}
{"text":"I only come here for veggie samosas cuz they are the best in town! The line ups could get pretty long but the staff are very efficient and know how to service their customers quickly! I will not go anywhere else for veggie samosas."}
{"text":"The best samosa place in Scarborough. It's only $1 for 5! So it's perfect for a potluck, I would spend $5 and be done with it. 

I love the green and pink coloured sweets. (I have no idea what they're called) It is only $5 for a pound, a pound being 9 pieces. 

The samosa is great in terms of flavour and consistency. The spice is present but it doesn't over power the potato. The crust on the samosa is perfectly crumbly and crunchy. I personality prefer to dip them in ketchup, but eating them plain is fine as well. 

This place is great for a snack and for a meal. Worth the trip, or a visit if you're in the area. Super affordable and incredible taste."}
