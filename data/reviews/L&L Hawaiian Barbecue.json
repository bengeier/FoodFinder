{"text":"The food is good but.... the guy that takes the order looks miserable he looks like he cant wait to go home at least the food is good."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. I ordered the chicken Katsu with macaroni salad and white rice. I also ordered the cream cheese wontons. The food was delicious. The service was quick and our server was very friendly. You have to check out this place!"}
{"text":"Yummy bbq chicken plate and macaroni salad.  Ordered regular size. They give you so much.  Enough for 2 meals for average person,  but one sitting for me. Lol. So good,  sent my husband for same dish the next day.  Courteous customer service on phone and in person.  Better than lulu hawaiian bbq on dec and 215. That place has bland food."}
{"text":"Occasionally the Chicken Katsu is really thin and a bit tough at a lot of places. Haven't had that problem at this location. Food is good, service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Quick, painless on the pocket, big portions... But the mac salad is too heavy on the mayo... Some of the employees are nice, but the cooks always look mean. :/"}
{"text":"Good food for cheap. I normally get the seafood combo. BTW the macaroni salad is mostly mayo, I Recommend something else."}
{"text":"so in love with Hawaiian food, BBQ mix is my #1 choice and they have fresh ahi poki (raw tuna w/special sauce), got  to mention their mahi mahi( Pacific fish) with home made tar tar sauce, ono!!!"}
{"text":"They have really good spam musubi, which is the Food I go to Hawaiian bbq places for. This location is clean and the cashier was friendly. We made about 3 transactions because we decided to get a few more things to go and the cashier was very patient... After we spent about $30 she offered the free donuts with the purchase of $30 which was a bonus! I love their spam musubi. It's fresh and the flavor is really good without the tons of sauce added to it. It has a good amount that goes nicely with the amount of rice and spam. I also got the garlic mahi mahi and that was really good too! It's not fried which is the reason I got it..."}
{"text":"Very very very good costumes service, the cashier lady  so nice, friendly, and always smile when I go there.   The food was great, I always ordering a BBQ mix, Katsu,  bento and musubi.  Man! I love this place, and always clean"}
{"text":"Although they were closing up, they were nice enough to let us stay and eat.  They have the best macaroni salad in Las Vegas.  Big portions and great service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered the bbq chicken, and it was so fatty he had maybe 2 bites total of the actual meat. I ordered the shortribs and they barely gave me any, and its all fat. Of course. Don't skimp on your food, both quality and quantity, because you'll lose customers. My boyfriend made it clear we're never coming back."}
{"text":"The food was very satisfactory. But in the end, it is just fast food. Portions are plentiful and prices are good. The macaroni salad was the best."}
{"text":"Go to this place twice a month. Really good service. The cashier is nice (also cute!) and very good at her job. Food is always excellent. Will continue to go to this L & L and avoid the rude cashier at the Maryland Pkwy. location."}
{"text":"Excellent!  I got the Kalua pork and lau lau pork... sooo good!! And once again great customer service! !"}
{"text":"this is the only location I would go to because 1) great service and friendy people 2) they are not stingy woth portion unlike other location I tried! 3) food prep is always on point and tasty"}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed. Bomb.com
I made a 5star review for this location a couple years ago but took it down for this update. I just went there as usual and again they did not disappoint. There's usually a young girl working in the afternoon when I go, I'm not sure her name but I really appreciate the staff here for their customer service and the food quality"}
{"text":"Best location in Las Vegas. Great service and I feel like they have more Food Selections then other locations."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Mainland L&L's here in Vegas! 

This one is definitely cleaner than the one on Maryland Pkwy, which I can appreciate :P 

The quality is very good as well. I had the Teri chicken mini & was very satisfied. Normally I like to get the BBQ mix plate, but just wasn't very hungry this day. 

Better than most of the other Hawaiian places I've eaten at here in the Valley."}
{"text":"If there were an option for NO STARS I would have chosen that.  I ordered short ribs, well I got a container filled with 3/4 rice, no macaroni salad and 3 Kalbi ribs that were cooked to death, burnt and I could not eat them.  I returned the food and the cashier would not refund my money, she told me it was too bad if I did not like the food. After a somewhat heated debate and me reminding them of their previous run-ins with the health department, she opened the drawer and handed me $11.00 out to the $11.85 and told me never to come back.  What awesome customer service.  Don't worry, I will never ever go back to L and L again."}
{"text":"Worst L & L experience ever!  I've been to numerous L & L's and generally the service is pretty good, just not at this location.  Ordered a bbq mix over the phone and when I went to pick up my order, found out that they had screwed up my order and made a bbq chicken plate instead.  No big deal, I figured they would make now make my correct order, WRONG.  Was told that they were closing and they couldn't prepare my order.  They close at 9 pm I was there at 8:38 pm! I then asked if they could comp me a beverage at least since they screwed up my order and was willing to pay for the bbq chicken anyways.  NOPE, cashier refused to comp me a drink even though he screwed up my order and refused to make it right.  Paid for the damn meal anyways because I was hungry :-(  Will not return to this location again!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure visiting this L&L. Seems as if every time I show up here (which is not often) the same nice counter girl is working. The food is typical L&L that tastes as good as it does in Hawaii.  The counter girl is always polite and helpful and she always makes sure that you have all of the condiments, spoons etc if you are taking out.  I love to come here and eat the great food that they serve.  Recommended."}
{"text":"If I could this location would get zero stars. I will never return to this location again. I got kalbi that was under cooked. The mac salad tasted like it was spoiled. There was no sauce for the katsu. I will continue going to the location on Serene. Never have I had a problem at the serene location."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! Very friendly and extremely clean. The portion sizes were a lot bigger than i expected, which was great aha! The best part is that they also offer healthy substitutes such as, brown rice instead of white rice.  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Quality of the food isn't that great. Also, lady in the front counter who's always working there really hates her job. She doesn't smile, has a attitude, and maybe a stick up her ass."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place!  Food is always great here.   I usually stick to the pork ribs here and have never been dissatisfied.  They are always friendly here.  Great place to get a quick lunch.  I HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"The bbq ribs with teriyaki sauce was excellent!!  This was a great restaurant. If you haven't eaten at L&L Hawaiian barbecue you have to check it out.  Service and food quality were top of the line!"}
{"text":"Close to home, very convenient.  My whole family loves the katsu curry chicken because of the large portions.  Myself, I try different things to spice-it-up.  So far, so good.  We are regulars and the young girl that took our order, always remembered us and was nice.  We haven't seen her for quite some time, though.  She was great.  I have ordered party trays, also,  Everything is good.  We also love the macaroni salad.  I eat it with some rice.  It is the best.  I would love to get that recipe.  American macaroni salad at the deli is too sweet, their macaroni salad is the best and we won't eat any other."}
{"text":"Restaurant open at 10:00am and all employees came in 10:00. I came in at 10:00 and its 10:30 I still don't get my food...........Because THEY START PREPARE FOOD AND EVERYTHING FROM 10:00!
Soooooooooooooooooooo slow"}
{"text":"This place is okay, but we all ordered different chicken meals and the chicken was very low quality. Very fatty. The rice, however, was excellent as was the price."}
{"text":"I used to like this place. But they started skipping on the food. And the taste isn't all the good anymore."}
{"text":"For the price ..little thin  I mean thin .really thin slices  of beef .and a lot of fat  around .I guess i paid $10buck for rice .I can steam that at home ..not impressed one star for your great rice"}
{"text":"L & L short ribs are the best. The people here remember me and what I want to eat. The service is what makes the location. :)"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and very fresh. Made to order. Staff is very sweet and caring. Not pushy at all, fast service. Definitely be back again. Plenty of time to eat on lunch break."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken katsu curry and BBQ mix, it was good, however they give you two small scoops of rice and don't give you sauce to go. You have to go pour your own.  The lady that took my order wasn't too friendly."}
{"text":"Dank Food and Dank water Pokemon in the area (behind toys R us) ! Went Pok√©mon hunting 3 Saturdays in a row and ate lunch at L& L every time. Onyx spawned in restaurant. I had the roast pork and hambersteak plate, both good and decent portions. Will definitely return after every hunt."}
{"text":"Ok, I was in the mood for some hawaiian food and this was a place close to where I live. The lau lau was what I was craving and at least they do this right. Customer service sucks, the female cashier has an attitude and at the end of our meal my friend and I wanted some bags to takehome our leftovers so the oil wouldn't dirty the car. Waited a couple minutes and nobody came, the chef saw me and didn't say anything, finally, I just got the bags myself. Seriously, where's the aloha spirit?"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and I usually come 3 times per week. The place is quite small but clean. I think the food is okay. However,  the lady that works here is not really friendly. Every time I tried calling in, she'd give me and my boyfriend the biggest attitude."}
{"text":"I looove L&L, I always get the Chicken Katsu Musubi & Thai Tea Boba. the food is great and all, but the employees? Hmm... Not really satisfied. They have this uninterested look on their face like they're forced to serve you lol and one time as I was waiting for my food this lady at the cashier wouldn't stop mean mugging me. Well, I don't know if it was just how she looks at people but it was kind off freaky.. but if we talk about their food and BOBA, it's fantastic! Totally recommend to family and friends. (Kimchee Spam Fried Rice is a must have)"}
{"text":"I sure do miss working close to this location. Great customers service and the food is always fresh and good! Wait time is short and you can call in your order for pickup!"}
{"text":"Didn't feel like driving to my normal L & L Hawaiian barbecue place and tried this L & L because it was closer. Lady that was cashiering was very straight forward. Didn't exactly feel friendly. Was craving spam fried rice...and then was informed that there was no kind of fried rice at all on the menu. Thought this was weird for L & L. I was hungry so I gave it a chance anyway. There were a couple of customers before me and a couple of customers after me as well. They were all dining in. They all got their food before I did. I guess take out is last priority. (I even tipped) Waited about 20 min. Was definitely not satisfied. The portions were decent. Quality was ok. Was not as tasty as my normal L & L spot. I probably will not try this place again."}
{"text":"While looking for a last minute place to eat for dinner, we happen to stumble upon the hawaiian fast food chain, L&L, located in the Albertsons shopping center 
(215 & Rainbow). 

Prices are fair for the amount of food you get. Quality of the food is always consistent. Although it may not be the most authentic hawaiian food in town, it satisfies our hunger."}
{"text":"Hooray!!! L&L!!! I have been already a frequent customer since this L&L has been open and I can't be more than happy because FINALLY there is better quality food around this area to eat for LUNCH!!!  

Customer service is great. Food quality is perfect too. Not undercooked or overcooked. They have been really friendly and also I love the fact that they offer free drinks with your combo plate PLUS free samples of their cream cheese wontons or egg rolls. 

My all time favorite order = Mini Chicken Katsu 

HAPPY CAMPER!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is okay.  This is the place to go when your tired of eating burgers and tacos!!!!"}
{"text":"I love l&l bbq, I actually just found out they can cut your chicken plates !!! But for some reason today my husbands chicken plate was so salty he took a few bites And lost his appetite. I hope that it may have just been a one time incident as any other time we really enjoy the food here"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with this Hawaiian food chain, especially when there is a limited selection of good food in the North side! It's on the corner of Craig and Losee, also called \"Cannery Corner\" just off of the I-15 heading north towards the speedway.

I'll be honest, if you want more authentic Hawaiian food, this is probably not the place for you. If you've never had, this is a good way to dip your toes into the flavors of the islands because they have just the right amount of items that you can choose from. Plates come in two sizes, depending on what kind you get: \"mini\" size is one scoop of rice and one scoop of signature Mac salad, \"regular\" is two scoops of rice and similarly one scoop of Mac. Don't be fooled, compared to other Hawaiian locations, they double the amount of Mac salad for the side.

Here's the breakdown:

Mini Shrimp Tempura Plate (4/5): Pretty basic plate. 4 pcs of fresh fried Tempura shrimp. Batter is flavored well, not bland at all. Just wish there was more to it, I guess? There wasn't a sauce, so I just added some soy.
 
Regular Katsu Plate (5/5): VERY GENEROUS. I've always loved this dish, especially the katsu curry at this location because it's a very BIG serving. Cannot go wrong. Chicken is very crispy, but also moist. Still not a fan of the katsu sauce, though.

Fried Spam Saimin (3/5): Not featured on the menu or specials (or maybe I didn't see it) but they do offer it if you ask :-) They also offer a variety of meats to put in it if you don't wanna do the OG spam. It was \"so-so.\" Lacked a bit of flavor and I think they used thinner noodles rather then actual saimin noodles. 

Mac Salad (4/5): As mentioned earlier, portion-wise it is double what you get at other establishments. Very flavorful, but I just don't enjoy the heaping amount of mayo. *Please keep in mind this is a personal preference because I don't really like mayo.

I haven't been disappointed yet with anything from L&L. This location alone is bigger than others I have been to and seen, plus it is also very clean. This franchise is good and I love the food, it's just not as authentic as other Hawaiian establishments I've been to."}
{"text":"Love it here! Food is great, flavor is delicious. Love the salad. We always order the plate with 3 meats, beef, ribs and chicken. Portion is great, perfect for 2.  Great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"This l&l is HORRIBLE I went to get food for me and my family and thank goodness they didn't eat it mainly cause the employees forgot a lot of things but that's not the case at the moment. I got my meals a couple of days ago like not yesterday but the day before yesterday and ate some of the food I didn't understand why I didn't finish it but until I ended up in the hospital yesterday with fucken food poisoning and I called the manager right away and told them and they refuse to give me my money back this location is horrible!!! If you want to get sick and treat like crap go head and go to this location but if I was you I would go to a better place for Hawaiian good and it's called aloha kitchen that place is AMAZING!!! And super cheap and they are friendly true Hawaiians."}
{"text":"I love this location in the west side of Las Vegas everything seems to taste better here than most other locations. And the musubi is cheaper here so that's a  bonus"}
{"text":"L and L Hawaiian Barbecue brought from Hawaii to Las Vegas still maintains it's large menu selection, and genuine Hawaiian tastes.  They definitely did a favor to local Hawaiians living in Vegas, by adding malasadas, butter mochi and other special items.  L and L, also has a great health conscious menu. Service is quick, food is fresh and the price comparable to other Hawaiian take-out restaurants--the only setback is the measured two scoops of rice, for the amount of meat portons.  It was a pleasant surprise to, observe and listen to the live Hawaiian entertainment at the Centennial, L and L.  Kudo's to L and L, just don't measure the rice portions, pour it on!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the mood for some really good Chicken Katsu, I would go the extra mile to place my order at this particular location. There is something special about this place that makes me happy. I've tried the Barbecue Chicken and the meat is so juicy, tender, flavorful, it simply taste amazing! But I'm always drawn to getting the Chicken Katsu with brown rice and a side order of either the macaroni salad or green salad. I love that crispy texture of chicken dipped in their katsu sauce, it's just super delicious! Every time I make the same order I'm feeling very satisfied with my meal. The quality and portions they give are definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"I went to eat here today for my one hour lunch and the cashier guy was SO RUDE. First he got our order incorrect and instead of egg rolls he gave me some coconut pudding. I asked him if he could refund us the money and he said \"what am i gonna give you for 0.98 cents?\" I then said can I substitute it for anything he then said again \"for 0.98 cents really?, He then gave it to me. I told him that he needed to reevaluate his customer  service skills because he was not courteous. He then told me \" Its not my fault that you guys don't speak up and I didn't give you forks because you took the tray before so that's your fault!\" I WILL NEVER GO BACK AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE ! HE DID NOT WANT TO GIVE ME HIS NAME THEREFOR HE HAS BEEN RUDE TO OTHER PEOPLE BEFORE!"}
{"text":"Friendly and delicious. I'm a mad I didn't come here before !!!!!  I found my new fat boy spot. :)"}
{"text":"The kalua pork is good but I think the Hawaiian ministry at my church can make better food. My aunt his Hawaiian too so I know what good Hawaiian food is... But then again family cookin' is always better!  So its hard to tell if its good when I'm comparing it to the cooking of my Hawaiian fam. However, the place also has a weird smell.... Which definitely takes away much of the enjoyment"}
{"text":"I've gone here twice the past month. The cashier is friendly and the service is pretty quick. The 1st time, I got the bento meal. The chicken, beef, and mahi mahi were tasty. Even the macaroni salad was good. I took it to go and it lasted two meals. The 2nd time, I ordered the ramen burger meal. I regret ordering it. It was pretty bland. I don't think the ramen was even seasoned. There was not enough flavor or sauce. Toppings were scarce. The hamburger patty was small. It looked like there was 4x more ramen than meat. Also the fries were huge and unseasoned. I would come here again but I'd keep away from that ramen burger."}
{"text":"Store is supposed to close at 10:pm. 
I walked in at 9:40, all lights on and the door open. 
Women behind counter looks up from counting her register and says we are closed. I said really, you close at 10. A cook from the back said sorry bro we are closed, and the woman at the counter looked back down and continued counting her register and said nothing else. 
If you close at 10pm, close at 10pm. At the very least, turn your lights off and lock the door. 
Very bad business practice, and I'm in the industry myself as a General Manager of a restaurant. Will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Terrible customer services.  Gave me the wrong food and refuse to exchange."}
{"text":"I love L&L and the chow for the most part is fairly consistent wherever I have gone.  I rolled in with the GF and the Boy one night to give the particular location a try for dinner.  Upon making entry I was immediately put off by the socially awkward nature of the lad taking our order. I absolutely hate when no help is offered in making a selection, and I feel like I am being pressured by the order taker to hurry up. This makes me want to give a two star rating but the food prevents me from doing so.  I will say that if I ever pull into the parking lot and see this fellow working the counter I will immediately turn around and walk out.  

The food as previously stated is a solid fare. My L&L Hawaiian BBQ Mix Plate was what I would expect it to be.....A-OK."}
{"text":"This is the farthest EAST of the islands where I can get my Hawaii food fix and this place doesn't disappoint.  I was in town for a quick trip and I went straight to the restaurant after landing.  Unlike the one's in Oahu, they have a lighter fare and I had the chicken over brown rice with light sauce.  The service was fast and the food was hot and tasty.  I will be returning for another visit soon when I have more time to try more items from the extensive menu."}
{"text":"I really love this place, everything it's really good. The food was amazing, the customers services always the best, the lady in the front always nice and helpful. I always bought a garlic shrimp with rice and macaroni salad....."}
{"text":"I have yet to try other options but between this and Aloha, pretty much same. Descent. I need to try Roy's, although I am sure it is going to be much pricier!"}
{"text":"I usually frequent this place often, very disappointed in the customer service today. I always call ahead and place my order to go, never any issues. Today though when i called at 4pm the guy who answered the phone was very rude so I i canceled my order."}
{"text":"Pretty good! It's weird though, the Ahi poke is very oily and the Kalua pig is a bit on the dry side. Outside of these minor criticisms, it's a nice place to eat. Very friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Yes sirrrr!!! 

I went here for the first time with a co worker.. This place is legit..

I got the BBQ chicken which came with 3 fried shrimps and a good size piece of fried fish.. It also came with rice and macaroni salad which was delicious...

I also got the the Thai tea which was nice and sweet!

10-15 min later our food came out and I was not disappointed, the chicken was flavorful and moist.. 

The shrimp was battered nicely with the pakeo breading... 

I'm going to cut this short and say this is a must go to spot when in the area.. If I'm back in the area, I will be back!!! I left feeling nice and full..

I miss this spot already, damn!"}
{"text":"We came in tonight because my boyfriend was craving some Hawaiian BBQ Chicken and because another Hawaiian restaurant (that's closer to us) was closed today.

Though their prices are reasonable and the portions are plenty, the food was just so-so. We both got BBQ Chicken plates which came with macaroni salad and free fountain drinks (which was cool). The chicken was tender, but lacking some flavor. So, it was better dipped into the teriyaki sauce they provided. The mac salad was bland and you could only taste (and see) how much mayo was in it.

We've been here once before and always believe in trying a place a second time (just in case their kitchen was having an off day). However, their food hasn't changed much and I don't foresee us coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sitting outside the l n l Hawaiian BBQ before closing hours and they won't assist me. Lost out on my money and I won't be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and staff were nice. Now the food is AMAZING and pretty reasonable on price for the size of the meals!!! Pleasantly surprised at this tucked away gem of the ninth island!!! Mahalo!!!"}
{"text":"I must say that this location is the best L&L Hawaiian barbecue I've ever been to since I've been back from Hawaii! I have the Loco Mocho and their beef here was pretty good compared to others that I've been to. They also separated them macaroni salad in a small plastic container so it won't get all squishy combined with the other food in the plate. My boyfriend got the spare ribs and the size of it is huge and not sorry looking  like the other places we've been to just all the bone and if you're lucky there's some meat on it also to include that there more fat than meat..

This location is very clean and 14 minutes away from the strip and very calm with Hawaiian music in the background"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see an L&L with four stars because the chain restaurants generally get 3/3 and a half stars. I normally eat at family owned Hawaiian restaurants but I came in to give this a shot. 

The worker was very nice and gave good service. I ordered the half BBQ chicken and half short ribs combo. My boyfriend got half chicken katsu curry and half BBQ beef combo. We also got two spam musubis. The worker kindly brought out the teriyaki sauce with the food also.

The chicken katsu curry was delicious. I loved the crispiness of the katsu. However, my box had an eyelash in the rice which was disappointing. Also, my short ribs and chicken wasn't grilled enough. The spam musubis' spam was small with more rice than what I'm used to. I would probably only come here if I wanted chicken katsu curry."}
{"text":"I had L&L for this first time years ago, and wasn't a fan at the time. After hearing nothing but positive feelings towards it from other people, I wanted to try it again. I have only been to this location, but I really enjoy it. I always call in my order and it is ready in about 10 minutes. There are a few ladies that work the front and they are all superb and friendly. The food is always satisfying and I think the portions and pricing are very fair."}
{"text":"I've been in town for only a week and I've eaten here 3 times already. Food gets better every time. The staff is super friendly and the food is fantastic. Prices are unbelievable for the quality of the food. I've been to Hawaii many times and I've never had a meal there this good. Looking forward to trying something else on the menu in a couple days."}
{"text":"Ordered to-go with my family. We were going to eat here but it was hot inside. AC must have been broken or something. Anyways, haven't eaten here in awhile since my family likes Aloha Kitchen better but L&L was closer today. I ordered a simple breakfast plate: Portuguese sausage with eggs & rice. Simple. Didnt taste bad & didnt taste super good. My boyfriend got the Loco moco. He said it tasted good but how can you mess up a pattie with gravy & egg? My mom ordered the short ribs which were BURNT. Ew. It was mostly fat with no meat anyways. So that was a waste of a meal that my mom didnt eat. Won't be back. I'd rather drive the extra 15 mins for some good Hawiian food."}
{"text":"I love this Hawaiian Barbecue restaurant. The service is always so great and they're very friendly. Besides that, the food is amazing. It's so tasty and it's always cooked fresh. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the barbecue chicken plate.  Not bad.  Left me feeling full and bloated.  It's about what you would expect."}
{"text":"I love coming to this location , this lady that's always working is so nice to me and the cook is quick .. It's peace & quiet and so relaxing I recommend to at least check it out and tell me what you think"}
{"text":"Went here because there was a coupon for Buy One Get One 50% Off deal so i figured i can get some food that'll last me a while so no cooking for the next day.

Spam Musubi
Spam was cut REALLY thin and rice was piled on high. Should be renamed to \"Rice Musubi with just a light hint of spam\"

Seafood Combo

Shrimp Tempura
From the people that brought you \"Rice Musubi with just a light hint of spam\" comes Tempura With Just a Hint of Shrimp Between Thick Coats of Fried Batter. 

Mahi Mahi
Well it's lightly battered. Lightly as in how much spam is in the Rice Musubi with just a light hint of spam. LAUGHABLY thin i mean pork cutlets don't get this thin. Let me put it this way. When i opened the takeout container i saw everything except for the mahi mahi, got the menu to confirm there was mahi mahi then got ready to call the place because they forgot to give me the mahi mahi, it turns out it was under the shrimp but i didnt see it or think about it because it's laughably thin.

BBQ Chicken
Hello? HELLO?! TASTE?! FLAVOR?! AROMA?! ANYTHING?! yeah has no taste...put some MSG on it or something

Macaroni Salad
Tastes like Mayo! (I hate mayo!)

The other plate i got is the BBQ Combo

BBQ Beef
I swear they keep a deli slicer in the back so they can slice meat as THINLY AS POSSIBLE. Texture suggests the beef is brined with a baking soda solution to give it a softer more artificial tender.

Korean style Short Rib
I cant even look at it considering how disappointed i am with everything. Since it's beef it's most likely going to have the artificial tender baking soda solution trick texture and an overpowering cheap marinade taste.

Hello L&L Hawaiian BBQ
Good Bye L&L Hawaiian BBQ i hope i never have to resort to eating at this chain or location ever again."}
{"text":"I just moved to a new area, so we went exploring down Rainbow Blvd for somewhere to eat.  I noticed the familiar L&L logo in this plaza and immediately thought of the L&L back home at Puente Hills Mall.  I love me some BBQ and rice, so I couldn't resist! 

Went here the first time with a BFF.  On our visit it was nice and clean; a small hole in the wall location, they had a few booths to sit in.  We ordered the BBQ Mix plate and actually just shared it (since it was breakfast for us).  Although empty upon our arrival, the place quickly became busy.  

The second time, I ordered to-go.  Both times the food was good, but I have yet to veer away from my usual BBQ plate and try their other menu items, so for now, my review will remain at 3 stars.

I definitely will be coming back to this place when I'm craving some Hawaiian food. =)"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm sure we all know all about L&L! Well if you don't then shame on you. Just kidding, anyhow if you've been to one L&L Hawaiian BBQ then you've been to them all . They all look the same in side and out at almost all location but this one is one of my favorites. 

I like this L&L because they always have these specials that are hand written on the paper and posted up all under the menu and temps me to order everything because everything is sooooo good! 

But this visit was a game changer. I tried something that I've seen before but put off because I didn't think anything of it. But boy oh boy was I so glad I finally tried the \"Ramen Burger\" yup you heard me, the Ramen burger. So I order that and was kindda excited and didn't know why but I was. 

We got it to go so when we got home I opened the box with so much joy and when I saw the pathetic looking thing I was disappoint. The Ramen was not as big as it looked on their ad the lettuce was wilted and I don't remember if there was any green onions on it. But that all changed really quick after I took the first bit. Yummmm it was so on point I didn't give a crap how it looked. The ramen actually held together, the burger was the right thickness and cover with just the right amount of Teriyaki sauces and the wilted lettuce, well....even they were perfect. Let me tell you I didn't miss any bun, cheese or ketchup and mustard in this burger. Believe me when I say I am going to promote the sheet out of this delicious discovery.

Oh and it was $4.50 plus I got their zig zag fries and it just hit the spot. A must try. I will definately order this again. Oh and the portions and flavor of the food at this location is always filling and so good! So go em tiger and be happy!"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Service is always friendly.  Prices are really good.  One of my to go places for yummy Hawaiian food.  The have really good Mahi Mahi."}
{"text":"Chef special was rainbow fried chicken so I asked the cashier if it taste like shoyu chicken and her reply was \"I don't know what shoyu chicken is\". Are u for real??? Shoyu chicken is a local food! Obviously these workers are not from Hawaii! FAIL! I ordered kalua pork and laulau combo...very disappointed...kalua was so dry and the worst part was..it did not taste like kalua pork. Laulau had no taste either.  Seriously these workers need to go to Hawaii and taste the food or hire someone who knows how local food taste like. SMH! I give this no star but yelp wont let me go through without pressing a star."}
{"text":"Joy cashier she was out going person and super friendly. Food was so good and delicious we definitely going back to this place. And also area are clean."}
{"text":"This rating is on a moving scale. I wouldn't say it's a superb 5 star, but sometimes they drop down to a 3. Lately they have redeemed themselves. We stopped going here for a bit because the chicken Katsu was so thin, rubbery, and overly breaded and way over fried. BUT craving Hawaiian food we gave this place another try. Glad we did! I usually always see the girl cashier and she is always really nice, quiet, but nice. I love their macaroni salad and the lumpia and musubi. Sometimes things are a little too greasy, but overall lately this place has been consistently good. I'm not hawaiian, never been to hawaii, so I can't attest for the authenticity but I can say it's pretty yummy!"}
{"text":"Meh. I was craving Hawaiian food and came here for dinner tonight to satisfy my craving. Immediately upon entering the store the woman working the cash register said \"to go?\" She didn't say hi or anything and when we told her for here she said \"we close at 9\" Ok great it's 8:23 that means I have 37 minutes to eat. Now I would understand if it was 853 but come on. I've been to other restaurants that have served customers up until the last minutes of closing. I understand you want to go home but your business is open until 9 so that means I should be able to get food until then. I'm not that person who goes into a restaurant 5 minutes before close anyway and I thought 823 was a reasonable time to eat considering I just got off work at 7.

Anyways I ordered the loco moco plate which I've never had, and the bf ordered the bbq chicken plate. The loco moco was disappointing. The burger meat was not seasoned and the gravy was bland. The only thing I enjoyed was the mac salad I could just order that and be happy. The bbq chicken was just ok it's teriyaki chicken basically. 

I probably would go back because I love the curry chicken katsu and the bbq chicken saimin, but I'll get my order to go next time."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good. I come to this location at least 2x a month. The inside is bright and clean. The girls working the counter are both super friendly. I recommend the chicken katsu curry, the spam musubi, the teriyaki beef and the loco moco. I love their mac salad. I add some salt and a little pepper and it's delicious. The last time I tried the Thai tea, you can get with boba or without, I chose the latter. They make theirs with half and half. It was a bit too sweet for my liking, but still good nonetheless."}
{"text":"This was my second time here.  The first time I was too tired to figure out what I wanted and I ordered some random dish that I ended up tossing.  This time it was quite exceptional!  I ordered the Garlic Shrimp plate, not the healthy version, the regular version and it was delicious!  The Ahi Poke was very flavorful as well.  The guy at the register was very nice and took the time to explain certain dishes and their makeup to me.  I was just not a fan of the macaroni salad.   I personally think it needs more spice.  Overall it was great and I will return again!"}
{"text":"After being extremely disappointed by Melodee with Ohana Hawaiian BBQ on Blue Diamond Rd., as she gave me the wrong order after repeating it back 4 times, I decided to take another chance and try the Chicken Katsu Curry from L&L Hawaiian and I am so glad I did. Not only was the chicken tender and fresh but they had no issues with giving me the items I actually ordered. However, I was so concerned about the curry sauce that I forgot about my Spam Musubi. I called and spoke to the female cashier who took my order and she immediately knew why I was calling. She stated  to come by and pick up my Masubi. When I arrived, I apologized for not noticing it was in the bag and she stated they were going to make me a new one as the one I originally ordered had been sitting out. I waited less than 3 minutes and when she handed me the container I was surprised to see that they had given me 2 Masubi's when I had only ordered one. The cashier stated it was a courtesy, smiled, and wished me a good day! I thanked her and stated that she will definitely be seeing me again. I am firm believer that restaurants including quick service restaurants should not only produce good products but they should also provide even better customer service as customer satisfaction is one of the key differentiators between you and your competitors. Thank you L&L Hawaiian BBQ for delivering delicious food and an incredible customer experience!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Always fast service and fresh food.  I go once a week. Everything is worth a try."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this spot, its close to the house and when we are craving some Hawaiian food this is usually our go to. We had called in a fairly large order the other day for pick up. When we arrived the total seemed quite high but we didn't question it, then when we went through the food we realized the order was incorrect. When we brought it to the attention of the cashier she was beyond RUDE.  We reviewed our order and even had the person recite it back to us on the phone, so how the order was further messed up is unclear. Nonetheless, she continued to argue and make it our fault. I understand mistakes happen but in a service industry correcting the error is usually the best course of action.  Very poor customer service! Good thing their food is still delicious!"}
{"text":"I know that franchise places aren't always the best, but I love L&L.  I lived in Hawaii for awhile so being able to eat some food that tastes like it did in the islands is amazing.  Personally, I typically get the chicken katsu or loco moco, but I've also enjoyed the spam musubi and other items.

Don't come here thinking you're gonna eat healthy cause L&L is about flavor, not calorie counting.  So run that extra mile or do those extra push ups so you can justify that fried awesomeness that is L&L!"}
{"text":"I love my L&L especially the chicken katsu. I always in the mood for local food being from the 808. Nothing more reminder of growing up plate lunches for lunch time or dinner. I know its chain so they have them all over the country. It might be more me but when in the islands everything taste better! Still everything is done most part same chicken katsu breaded same way and mac salad always been fan of. I like the barbecue chicken or beef, lau lau,  local moco, and miss few. The atmosphere just like any other L&L so feels like back home just for moment music, and see every flavor of Hawaiian Sun juice that local style!"}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii I miss a lot of the island food that I grew up with, this is one of the few places that help my cravings. Just a little disappointed that the quality of food has gone down since they've become a franchise. It's starting to taste like just another fast food joint."}
{"text":"The place is easy to get to and has great prices, you won't leave here hungry. The bento is the way to go I you are hungry, they offer lunch specials (free drinks) for workers in the area, the malasada is the bomb for a dessert. The staff is friendly and prices are ok for the amount of food you get"}
{"text":"I usually love L&L but tonight this location fell a bit short. Service was great, no problem there but I got the chicken Katsu and bbq chicken masubi. It was a bit dry :/ and I wasn't given any sauce at all. Still a fan of L&L and Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"I love Hawaiian food and usually I like L&L but this new location up in North Town didn't seem up to par with the food I usually get. I ordered a BBQ mix plate and while the kalbi was pretty good, the beef tasted kind of dry and overcooked although I still ended up eating it so it really wasn't too bad...just wished it wasn't so dry.

My co-worker and I ate here during the noon \"lunch rush\" on a weekday but this place didn't seem crowded at all, especially in comparison to the other restaurants around it. The kitchen is pretty quick though and we got our food in about 5-10 min.

I only noticed this new location because it's next to the Chipotle I frequent in the Lowe's parking lot at Craig/Losee. It's nice because it adds to the convenience and variety of food joints in this particular strip mall."}
{"text":"I wish the pulled pork was fresh but it wasn't the taste on the rest of the food was pretty good overall. The customer service is great and the staff is kind and helpful."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. I am a straight up islander and been to dozens of L&L over the past 10 years. Never have I been to one that served less than subpar. I bought the big plate and portion of a little plate in other L&Ls, they even forgot to give me my Mac salad. 
I don't recommend going to this location, you don't get what you pay for. That's not how we do it in the islands."}
{"text":"1st time at this location. Maybe it was just an off day for them but this L&L was junk. The rice was shitty & portions for a mix plate was given in a mini plate. Left with an unsatisfactory feeling. Customer service cashier was nice but the kitchen needs better cooks who know how to prepare local Hawaiian food correctly."}
{"text":"Love coming here service is so good always freindly, the order is always accurate, and the prices are cheap the roast pork is great i order it all the time"}
{"text":"First time at this location small seating area, employee was courteous.  Been a fan since 2003 so I have tasted a majority of their menu at different locations.  Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. Food has never disappointed me thus far.  They also have  healthier menu options available.  I ordered a combination plate for $9.65 plus tax  which gave me two pieces of chicken on top of cabbage salad,  two rice portions, short ribs, steak and macaroni salad. It was enough food for two different meals if not three."}
{"text":"Meh. Not bad. Not great. Large portions though, so good bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"I wanted something light & healthy since it's over 100 degrees here in Vegas and I found it.  I never had Hawaiian food before, but today was the day.  This nice sized portion BBQ chicken bowl had flavor, fresh ingredients.  I was impressed.  Priced nicely under $9.  So worth it.  The decor was ok but who cares if you are delivering good food.  Very nice order taker.  She was on the phone constantly taking orders so u know they must do good food.  I wish I had this spot back in Chicago, maybe we do but for now I will patronize this spot."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of L&L because I've never had a good meal here. My husband wanted to come here. He ordered the mochiko chicken and I ordered the beef curry. His chicken was juicy and tasty. My beef curry was OK for the most part except one of the beef chunks wasn't cooked. It was a bit raw. My mac salad had too much mayo. If for some reason I was dragged here again, I would prob get their BBQ chicken or the mochiko chicken. I've never been a fan of their meat combos."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and today I actually tried something other than the spam musabi! If you're super hungry and like spicy, I recommend the spicy chicken plate. On a scale from 1-10 it's about a 5. There's only a large which is $8.99 but holy chicken, it's a lot of food. I shared my dish with my girlfriend and we couldn't even finish it together. Plus you get a side of white rice and macaroni salad. 

But also, I got spam musabi 

Staff is great and accommodating."}
{"text":"Whether you like Hawaiian style food or not you should try it. There are many familiar comfort dishes at L&L. 

I have not only eaten here, but other Hawaiian BBQ/food establishments. L&L is definitely the most convenient and often easy to find, but sometimes lacks the same \"yummy\" factor.  The short ribs are a bit on the thin cut side and the chicken can at times be a bit dry; however, of all the places I have ever been the macaroni salad is the best.  

I really like the fish burger with fries.  There are a lot of fries and just the right amount of mayo."}
{"text":"I paid extra for extra spam but it looks as if they just cut the spam into bigger pieces rather then adding more spam like I ordered. These are the times I rather have made it myself and saved myself some money."}
{"text":"Always reminds me of home! Love coming here and can never ever get enough of it. I just wish I had a partner to eat with, always seem to be eating solo lol!"}
{"text":"- \"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results\". 

How this relates to me is that I keep looking for good Hawaiian food here on the mainland only to endure disappointment after disappointment. My visit to this L&L was no exception. 

The staff, while really nice, probably has never stepped foot on the islands. She didn't know what a malasadas was nor heard of fried saimin. I had asked if the cooks knew how to make it. 

I guess they didn't know how to prepare the BBQ beef as well because it was a little too well done. The lau lau needed more salt too. The highlight for me was the macaroni salad. However, I tend to love most things that try to kill me from the inside out. 

Maybe it was a bad day for the cooks as I've had better. At even other L&L locations."}
{"text":"I love their BBQ mix here! I always get it in the mini size one which comes with a variety of meats (3 I think of chicken, ribs and a brisket like meat), scoop of rice, and a heaping scoop of Mac salad! Mmmmm!! Prices aren't bad either and they are extremely filling!

Store is very clean, staff is nice and there's a great selection of food."}
{"text":"Their katsu here is great, but the BBQ plate combo for $8+ is huge and largely disappointing. Meat wasn't flavorful enough and I thought BBQ was supposed to have some kind of crispness? Their BBQ did not...

Won't be coming back here, unfortunately, unless my nieces make me come back, since they like the katsu and unlimited soda refills. There are better L&L locations and even better Hawaiian food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The 3 stars are really for the unbelievably disappointing service we received. Actually, as a fan of L&L, we found the food very fresh, and slightly above par. So, if you care only about food, and not being treated with any kind of respect as a patron, this is the place for you. 

We ordered the family pack, which in theory is a good deal. However, at this location, comes ONLY with cans of Hawiian juice as a drink option. As our family will not drink these juices, we asked if we could substitute always cheap fountain soda. After some drama, we were told that we could sub 3 sodas for the 4 juice cans. 

Moving on, they were offering a promotion. Spend $35 get a free spring roll. Spend $50 get 10 free pot stickers. We were over $48. Meaning less than $2 from the next free promotion. When we asked if we could have the pot stickers rather than a spring roll that would not be eaten, we were told no. We were welcome to order more food. 

The reality is, free food is free food, and they did not have to give us anything. We get that, but 2 bucks to get return business, I just think it is worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great food and appreciate that when my family comes in the cashier remembers us and our preferences. The food is always delicious and freshly made. We will definitely be loyal customers for years to come."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is great! The girl working the register gave amazing customer service! The food is super fresh, delicious, well seasoned (but not too much, just the right amount), and the they don't skimp out at all! Hearty portions for a reasonable price. The garlic shrimp was excellent as was the chicken katsu. I would highly recommend this place to anyone as they have a wide variety of meats and seafood prepared in various ways. It was a great experience at a gem of an establishment. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Big portions, friendly staff, reasonable prices . Fast food Hawaiian Style, what more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for years- never once have I had a problem until tonight. I work for an emergency vet and we come here atleast once a week. I've never had issues using multiple cards for the orders due to picking up food for multiple people at my hospital. Well tonight the guy upfront whom claims he was the manager told me I could not use seperate cards. So after j spoke to the 3 other people at my job about it I got ok'd to use a card for all of the orders. He then proceeded to card me for it- I told him it wasn't my card and the persons card was at work but on the phone- he refused me up and downto get food from there because of this. You guys have lost our business for good and it's sad with how much we spend in there on a weekly basis. He could have had a little more respect also."}
{"text":"Was not happy with the service , prices, or portions. I got to meet neighborhood one and pay the same or lower and get bigger portions and a smile. most important the the smile...I think I could have handled my stop here"}
{"text":"This has become a \"go-to\" spot for my wife and I and I feel like the reason for that is because of a balance between price, healthy options, and great tasting food. I like to stick with a low glycemic or even a low carb diet and the availability of brown rice and Atkins style plates really help me keep my diet in check. Last but not least, the staff there are very friendly and accommodating. You can tell they work well as a team and it reflects in their food and service."}
{"text":"the food always hits the spot. 
i love the food and the service here is great. they definitely have that warm welcoming island hospitality.   

If Aloha Kitchen is your usual go-to for Hawaiian food, I would definitely give this place a try. It's just as good ."}
{"text":"Went to this location on my way to work. It was basically like all the other locations just smaller. I called to order pick up and it was done within 5 minutes of my call. Super convenient , and the food was tasty. I was disappointed in the parking situation where they are located and being next to a disgusting smoke shop with people smoking outside the door was not pleasant. Probebly would move to a different retail bay if I were them. The type of crowd chilling outside the door can turn people away from coming inside. I wouldn't have gone in at night. I'll go back if I had too, but my #1 locations is henderson off Stephanie."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered the typical Portuguese sausage, eggs and rice. It was so quiet in there that I was scared that I was ordering my food too loudly. Anyway, food came out promptly. The sausage was a little overcooked and saltier than what I remember. The eggs were cooked perfectly at medium. Not a big fan of macaroni salad and this place reminded me of why I'm not a big fan of it. Too much mayonnaise and no other flavoring. I tried putting soy sauce on it because I hate wasting food, but I just couldn't take another bite. I frequent this chain when I'm in the mood, but this location is a little sad."}
{"text":"Same l&l from what we come to expect at this new location ...Except when we came in the cashier was super helpful. She even helped my son get a drink and strap my friends baby in the high chair! Totally recommend this location"}
{"text":"Great place me and my friend ear there twice a week 2 min from the office...always taking care of us great food on time I will keep going there and enjoy the food ...they have great garlic salmon...."}
{"text":"L&L Hawaiian Barbecue can be found on the southeast corner of Warm Springs and Rainbow Blvd. It is actually located right next to PostNet (see seperate review) in the Albertsons shopping plaza.

I do miss my usual spot of Ohana Hawaiian BBQ over off of Eastern, but I moved....so I guess I'd better find a new spot.

This place is pretty frickin' awesome in its own right! I've only been here a handful of times so far, but the food has been on point! I usually like to order either the hamburger steak or the bbq chicken or the loco mocco , or some kind of combo of the bunch. The portions have been generous and the meat very tasty every time I have been here.

Not only that, the service has also been friendly and helpful! The young ladies working the counter have always been sweet and quick to offer suggestions. 

They also have a punch card available where once you order 10 meals, you get one for free! Sweet! What a deal!

I like this place and can see this becoming a regular spot!

4 stars!"}
{"text":"I use live by the original l&l in Hawaii on liliha st.now that was some good grind these franchise one it ait the same:("}
{"text":"I used to go to the L&L at the Puente Hills Mall in SoCal all the time when I was in high school. This was the first time I came across an L&L in Vegas, probably because they're mostly located on the East side, so I was pretty delighted. 

This location is very small, but don't let that deter you. They have a lot of specials hanging on the walls and posted on the windows. To name a few, they have Calamari - $3.99, Thai Tea - $1.99, 10 malasadas - $4, 2 eggrolls - $1.50, Spam fried rice - $5.50. I just went with the usual Chicken Katsu and Don got Mochiko Chicken. I'm glad we both decided to get mini plates because they were huge! I remember when I used to go to L&L the mini plates were actually mini. When we went yesterday, the plates were almost the size of the regular ones. Each plate is probably good for two people. We both finished a little over half and took the rest home. I'm honestly not sure if the actual portion changed or if it was the plate though because we had one scoop of rice and one scoop of mac salad each. We definitely got more meat though. 

My plate was delicious as usual. Crunchy, well cooked Katsu and tasty mac salad. I've always prefered L&L's mac salad over all the other places in Vegas. I don't know if it's because I grew up on it or if it's actually better. I like that they gave it to us in separate little containers so it stays fresh in case you want to take it home. I tried some of Don's Mochiko Chicken. It was the first time I've ever tried this type of chicken and it was good! It's deep fried, but not oily and I liked dipping it in the Katsu sauce or the curry. 

I'm so glad they have an L&L in my side of town :)"}
{"text":"I wish this location was in San Diego, food was delicious made in a timely manner and the portions are very generous. The young lady at the front was very nice and she even brought our food to the table. I'll be visiting here every time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Placed a pick-up order with \"CJ\". He told me food will be ready in 10-15 minutes. He didn't ask for my name or my number. Twenty minutes later, we were on our way to pickup the food. Upon arriving, it turns out \"CJ\" didn't even placed the order. Now, I'm sitting here waiting for the food to get ready.

Make sure you call twice to see if your order was placed."}
{"text":"This is convenient for me. If I have no time to drive up to Island Flavor or time to get something from Ross J's in Henderson, I go here. They are all right, same recipes as the ones back in Hawaii, no different."}
{"text":"I am absolutely addicted to this place, the Spicy chicken and the spicy beef are so good I find myself craving it frequently!  Ahhh! Yum!"}
{"text":"Tried this location for the first time today. It's much more cleaner and the cashier was really friendly. :) 
We ordered the chicken katsu and the lau lau. The chicken was a little thin and on the dry side but overall the flavor was good. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is 7 bucks worth of food. Their \"mini low carb plate.\" Literally one egg, one beef, and one chicken. Also got a Double cheeseburger where the meat was burnt. She apologized and gave us a refund for that. 0 star for the kitchen, 4 star for customer service lady up front."}
{"text":"Great little stop for Hawaiian food. I love how fast everything is, despite it not being as local as other local eateries.  It still has that flavor, but it's changed since my first time there.  Still, good food."}
{"text":"I trust this establishment to make my food. The people are nice and the food is great. I get the BBQ mix combo and it comes with chicken, beef, and ribs and 2 scoops of white rice. This always fills me up and I'm left with leftovers for later.  It usually takes 5 minutes to make my food fresh. 

The price is about 10 bucks. I would recommend this spot for some quick food."}
{"text":"Alrighty Vegas Locals - if you really want to know where the Hawaiian BBQ joints in the valley all came from - L&L (maybe Rainbow Drive In, an original Hawaiian Plate Lunch joint going back many years, and still going strong!). 

Ok so what the heck is this place first of all? Plate lunch? What am I doing, talking another language? Huh?

Allright - newbies (or frequent fliers who are reading this). Plate lunch is a plate (or styrofoam container) loaded with 1) 2 enormous scoops of white rice, 2) macaroni salad Hawaiian style (it's good, trust me, just more mayo than the usual) 3) meat of your choice 4) drink of your choice

Now - when you enter, you aren't listening to anything but Island Reggae, (different than Jamaican Reggae). There are brightly colored walls, decorated with surf boards, and other surf related items.

Family favs here are the Chicken Katsu, Chicken Katsu Curry, Fried Mahi Mahi, and BBQ Chicken. Haven't had the Lau Lau at any L&L mainland or in Oahu due to the fact that we get our Lau Lau from a particular market in HI only. (Sorry L&L, we just love it so we stock up.) And of course with all this yummy (ok and semi greasy) morsels we have to have the fruit punch!!!

You can also buy on the side some mochi."}
{"text":"I bought the bundy plate and a burger patty- also had spam musabi - had it around 8:00 pm - woke up at 4:00 am vomiting and more - was sick the whole day and some of the next - seemed like it was from dirty food as it was gone on the third"}
{"text":"This will b my second time to this location. I can say its always good to come here is always welcoming and clean, and the service is always on point and fast! And let's not forget the amazing Hawaiian BBQ!!!  is so yummy and affordable! #loyalcustomer"}
{"text":"I visited another location once before and I had the chicken which I found to be unfavorable to my taste buds. I came to this location. The lady at the counter was so nice. She greeted me and my group appropriately. I order the short ribs/tempura plate. It was delicious. The peanut salad dressing tasted like peanut butter . I can't think of the name of the dessert but they were warm sugary donuts. Would recommend to anyone hungry looking for good portion sizes and great quality ."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this location because of the way they treat paying customers.  Forgetting items to our order, never offered to replace it when we showed the receipt.  She then has the nerve to ask, \"How long this been layering around, days!?\"  I thought maybe she didn't hear us, FRIDAY NIGHT 9:45pm, we ordered our meals to go. You not only shorted us on food, you didn't want to refund the money when we had proof of purchase. Then she like, \"Who you think pays the food cost?\",  YOU DO when you MESS UP. repeat after me, the Customer is always right. Piece of work you are.  You can't expect people to NOT be upset about poor service, MISSING food and burnt food.  I wouldn't eat it. I wouldn't expect someone too.  She just didn't get it about the principle.  I really wanted to ask her would you serve that to your family member?

The price you pay you should have more passion with cooking.  I've been to other L&L locations and they have some kind of feeling when they cook because I was blown away BY THE FLAVOR.  Loaded with bbq sauce, smokey flavor. I'll just continue going to the one 9 miles away from us.  They were friendly, cooks & servers have asked us how did we like the food.  They SMILE, personable, pleasant people.

 I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt when I read bad reviews about the cashier's attitude,  I should of avoided it.  MY OWN FAULT.  Glad to of made her acquaintance.  Franchise or not you should care about what you serve to people. There's no \"picture menu\" on their franchise website, what a load of crap she fed us.

I especially loved the review about the young lady that witnessed some leftover raw meat going into the trunk. Mmm. That was a year ago and one month, March 2014.  I don't believe everything on the internet but I would not be surprised if it happened since it's Spring Valley.."}
{"text":"4/11/15 Saturday 4:20 PM . There's like 4 people here... I ordered the Barbecue Chicken bowl with Brown Rice, carrots, Broccoli & Peas. Yummy for under $6. I asked for no soy sauce. It looked delicious on the flyer. Was very impressed with the flavor.  I'd return no problem. Wish we had one of these chains at Rhodes Ranch Town Center at Durango and Warm Springs.. The drive was worth it."}
{"text":"Came in to try Hawaiian for the first time. The guy working was in no mood for customers that day. I asked two questions. On the 2nd question I was told to just look at the menu. I ordered 2 of the meals. One of which was missing sauce and both tasted mediocre. Will not be returning to any L & L ever again. Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"Having been introduced to Chicken Katsu by a Hawaiian friend, I just can't get enough of this place.  The staff is always friendly and the food is made to order...not waiting around under heat lamps. I've tried other places and their recipes for Katsu, but have always been disappointed in the preparation (either cooked too much and dry, or too greasy and limp).  L&L has always been consistent."}
{"text":"Looking for some decent island food, this is the place to go.  Spicy beef is good as well as the curry katsu."}
{"text":"My other half HATES this place so we always agree to disagree, because I love it. He leaves me to enjoy my slice of Hawaiian style eating, while he leaves to pick up take-out at a nearby location. He returns and we dine together and the staff never minds. It's a win win dining experience and he has a happy wife (happy life). The BBQ chicken is always so tender that the meat falls apart from the skin effortlessly, and the rice is a perfect side. I opt out of the macaroni but that's just \"me\", nothing against their ability to produce great pasta. I will always return for my rebellious moments of individual opinion in WHATS GOOD to eat!"}
{"text":"absolutely the best place ever.  however they should provide real forks and knives , the flimsy forks and knives plastic provided for the eat-in diners is not too good. Always empty ...dont know why, the food and service is great.... very bright....and guess what the lavatories are super-clean and smell good....."}
{"text":"Soon as you walk in you are hit with the lovely island music and a smiling face! 

 I ordered the Chicken Katsu. Super yummy. Chicken was nice and crunchy but not dry. I am in love with their macaroni salad.

You definitely get your money's worth when it comes to their portions. Whenever I eat here it usually takes two days to finish a plate of food. I'm a foodie and usually order to mac salads so I can eat the other one the following day. 

When I went in today they had free 2015 calendars. Pretty sweet!"}
{"text":"Feeling a little home sick for Hawaii, I decided to dine with my hubby at L & L located at the centennial shopping center. As we walked in, the smells of teri chicken took me back.  They had music in the background , which was Keahiwai singing Push.

Then, the Hawaii themed counter hits ya with all the local fav combos on the menu.  The Korean lady cashier was very friendly and quickly took our order.  

Before we knew it we had our plate dinners.  I ordered the Kalua pork with cabbage and teri beef and my hubby ordered the curry chicken katsu.  For dine-in guests, there is refill drinks.  The combos came with, one scoop rice and mac salad.  The mac salad was in a small plastic container, not like in Hawaii, which is placed next to the rice.

My combo was tasty, but the strips of meat were too big, and the cabbage was not sliced thin enough.  My hubby's combo was tasty too. The curry chicken katsu had a good tang and too spicy.  The portions of food were plenty in both combo plates.  I tried their  and it was kimchee good but the cabbage slices were too big. 

It was nice having familiar food like on the islands.  Overall all, I liked the food and the prices.  I would definitely return to this location for a quick bite."}
{"text":"We've been eating here since they opened and sometimes it's hit or miss. Mostly pretty good...but...

Today it was a real miss - don't know who they have cooking but the Chix Katsu was way over done, the Teri Beef and Teri Chix was sooo dry and chewy...unreal kine dry...

The Mac Salad is usually pretty ono, but today for some reason pretty shittty.

There's a new one on Buffalo and West Lake Mead, same owner as the one up on West Charleston by Costco. Ate there twice and it seems they know how to prepare the food a little better."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan but lately I've been disappointed & might start venturing out to other Hawaiian food places in the area."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the service was awful. Called at 9, asked how late they were open. The guy said 10, so when I got there at 9:20 and said my order was \"for here,\" he said \"we close soon.\" I get that people want to go home at the end of their shift, but when I said \"yeah, I'll be done before 10\" he just gave me a dirty look. At 9:38 (yes, I looked at the time because I was annoyed), the cashier started stacking the chairs and turned the \"open\" light off.  

I was out the door at 9:43. No acknowledgment for the tip, no thank you. Nothing.

If you want to close at 9:30, or 9:45, or 3:12 for that matter, be my guest, it's your business. But don't rush me out 17 minutes before you close.  It's fast food, and I'll be fast, I promise. You stay open as long as you said you would, and I'll be out of your way by then.

I'm terribly sorry for inconveniencing you by being your customer. I promise it won't happen again."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a bite after Christmas shopping. We got it to go and it was all still hot and/or fresh when we go it home. The portion sizes are generous too. I got the Katsu Chicken with all mac and no rice. I was given a good helping of mac in addition to the good helping of chicken. It was a quick in and out. The chicken was flavorful and tender. The sauce was tasty and plentiful. L and L was as good as any other Hawaiian BBQ I've had in the area. I will definitely be back. The only drawback here is that they don't have Crab Rangoon. Three and a half stars for the missing Rangoon. No half star ratings, but good enough to round up."}
{"text":"What's up with the people who work here? Are you guys mad that you're not in the Islands right now having REAL spam musubi and loco mocos? Deng. Service with a frown. At least I got a Non-enthusiastic \"have a good day\""}
{"text":"We still miss the local food in Hawaii. Ok let's give this one a try. Well the food was not bad at all as a fast food restaurant. The bbq chicken was very flavorful and tender meat. The local moco was not bad to"}
{"text":"First time trying this place it was pretty tasty service was good very friendly I just came back from Hawaii a few months ago and the macaroni salad took me back and their meat combination plate was tasty"}
{"text":"Horrible- no meat! Worse L&L I ever been too! I got the mix bbq that had no meat what so ever w/ no cabbage!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Nevermind that the food is always amazing! The meat is always cooked to perfection and the Teriyaki sauce is absolutely awesome! The people that work there are always super nice and friendly! They greet me as soon as I walk in and are always so nice.  While I usually get carry out the restaurant is always very clean and everything is set up very nice.  I couldn't be happier with my favorite place to eat!!! Ok... Now I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"We walked in and they had great music playing so they definitely have a first impression. Second great impression was the customer service. Great customer service, enough said! Third and most important great thing  was of course, the food! Good was great. Chicken was yummy rice was good and so was the little side macaroni salad. To top it off, we wanted to get another side salad and she just handed is one for free! Free is awesome! Overall great place, nice aesthetic layout. Come here!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!  Food portions are huge and the quality is consistent... Recommend the mixed plate or Katsu/Teri beef combo with Mac salad!  I wonder sometimes if the owner is a local or just bought the franchise... But so far food is good representation of what you get in Hawaii."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for lunch at work. Everything I've tried there has been great, and the loco moco is my favorite. They are fast, fresh, and affordable. To top it off the staff is wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"I love me some Hawaiian food, and L&L's are amazing despite technically being fast food chains. 

This location has a good number of tables and an extensive menu. All of the items are affordable and portions are quite generous. 

Service is nothing special but the food is amazing, I have yet to have anything bad at an L&L."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.

As with most Hawaiian fast food chains, L&L Hawaiian offers generous portions at affordable prices. The menu is quite large as well, with notable additions of a saimin category and things like lau lau. The restaurant itself is large as well, with plenty of seating. 

Service was friendly, and if you eat in they actually bring your food to your table. I overheard the employees speaking in Mandarin to each other, which I rarely hear in restaurants like these! But it was amusing.

I ordered the kalua pork and lau lau combo, with macaroni salad and brown rice substituted for white rice. I also added a chicken katsu musubi. The kalua pork and lau lau were excellent, and it was a lot of food! The musubi was also fantastic, with nice crisp nori reflecting that it was made fresh. I've usually only had spam musubi, so it was cool that there were so many musubi choices.

I probably won't be back to this location in the future since I will be living in Spring Valley, but this is an excellent L&L!"}
{"text":"L & L Hawaiian BBQ gave me a great opportunity to try some new dishes in one inexpensive combination box. I had no clue what I wanted and the cashier offered up a combination of Chicken Katsu, BBQ Beef, BBQ Chicken, and Fried Mahi Mahi which peaked my interest. Not everything was amazing but there were enough high points to lead to a three star rating. Unfortunately the Mahi was a miss as something seemed off about it. The katsu was up there with my Las Vegas favorites and the other dishes were tasty. Can't wait to go back and try other menu items and hopefully raise my rating."}
{"text":"So disappointed that they only offer military discounts to active members only. Generally most places offer it to retirees. Yes I will stop going somewhere over something so trivial. The last time we went the Kailua pork about as bland as it gets. Will start going to another Hawaiian food place down the road that also delivers to the VA hospital."}
{"text":"Fresh food and it was tasty. The Chicken Katsu was delish!  Place is really clean and the girls behind the counter were nice."}
{"text":"What I got sucked!  There was no flavor at all, it was a cup of soup..... yea,  that's what I ordered, and cup of soups tasted better than this.  But my service was good, I can't complain about that.  But I was totally disappointed in my over priced cup of soup, lol"}
{"text":"I was driving around with my friend Andy looking for a quick bite to eat. Andy told me he never ate Hawaiian food and pointed out L&L. I like Hawaiian food so I decided to give it a try. We both had Loco Mocco and Chicken Katsu. The service was fast the cashier was on top of her game. The food only took about 10 minutes to get to my table. The Loco Mocco was cooked great the eggs were done perfect and the mac salad was great. The rice was disappointing. It tasted a little old. It was forsure not fresh. The gravy was bold and had a nice smokey flavor. The Chicken Katsu was good. Nothing real special. Tasted at times a little over cooked. The dining area was clean and very cold. The air conditioner must have been on high. I really enjoyed that. Overall the experience was good."}
{"text":"This is not my first choice, (I'm a fan of 808 Mixed Plate, Island Style, and Island flavor) but after a long day and craving local grindz, L&L will do in a hurry as its the closest spot near us, like 5-10 minutes from home.

Their Mini Katsu Curry hits the spot ( It ain't ZEN but it'll do in a jiffy) and will hold me over until my next craving hits for some quick and cheap local grindz....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Bland food, Zero customer service ...."}
{"text":"I love exploring and trying new Hawaiian restaurants and L&L is authentic and classic as you can get. The prices are really good and the portions are HUGE. I usually get the chicken katsu with rice and macaroni salad or the BBQ mix plate and I'd be set all day. Their loco moco is what i always get now because the patty is so juicy and the egg is cooked the way i love! (Over medium so the yellow egg yolk is runny when you poke it) The spam MUSIBI are huge and yummy as well. I love the poke there was well. If you like meat you'll definitely enjoy the short ribs with rice here it's so juicy and flavorful! I always have cravings for Hawaiian food and L&L just hits the spot and always makes me crave it! I can't wait to come and try the entire menu! This place is so soul comforting and the food options seems endless here! 

The area is pretty clean and the staffs are so helpful and nice. The food comes out pretty quick and portions are in a to-go box and it's HUGE and the price is cheap amounting to all the delicious food you get! My half and half order usually comes out to $10! 10/10 recommend checking this place out if you're looking for authentic and mouth watering hawaiian food!!"}
{"text":"L&L offers consistent good hawaiian food in large portions and its affordable for what you get. 

Service at this location was pretty good, they were attentive and friendly, clean restaurant. When I came in around 2PM I was the only one sitting down and mostly saw people getting takeout, nonetheless everything was great."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good hawaiian food, this is the place to go. I love how quick they are to get your order out the door. This is just down the street from my apartment so having them around is just so convenient! But convenience is not the reason why I keep coming here. I love their food!

Usually, I call them to do my order because I'm not really a fan of sitting in the restaurant after I order. So having the take-out option is fantastic from this place! Usually I get the combo which is great because you get to try everything out! Each of the meals comes with a deliciously made macaroni salad which always gets devoured first! 

Again, I always get the combination which is actually the BBQ mix. It's a combination of chicken, beef, and bbq. Fantastic combination of hearty meal with deliciously made sticky rice along with it. I'm a fan of this meal since it's very filling. It's deliciously seasoned so you're not just getting bland meat upon order. I think that they're all beautifully executed. 

Another thing that I get there is the loco moco. I don't know who orinally came up with this combination, but I just want to say-- AMAZING! I love the meat along with the gravy incorporated along with it. This is all over a bed of rice. This is just Asian comfort at it's best. 

The location isn't really at the best place as it's not as busy, but I don't think people really care about that since you'll see people coming in and out on their busy hours. I think this shows that regardless of location, if you have good food, people will go out of their way to visit you. This is definitely a perfect example of that."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are great. Food is good. Customer service is okay. Wait time is longer than it should be.

I'd still come back here since I like their food better than other fast food Hawaiian joints."}
{"text":"It is my first time dining here. The bbq beef was tasty, however it was a bit fatty hence the four stars. The poke was delicious. It was fresh, tender and mild tasting ahi tuna. It started out mild with a slightly spicy finish.
 I will definitely be returning to dine here again."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL garlic shrimp! As usual,  I couldn't decide which dish to try so I scored a recommendation of their garlic shrimp and then did a half & half combo of the Loco Moco with it.  The garlic shrimp was superb and left me wishing I would have settled on just that and skipped the comfort food of the Loco Moco. Nothing wrong with it, just the garlic shrimp was that good.  I even loved the cabbage underneath the shrimp.  Nom! They were able to accommodate my daughter's request for grilled shrimp in lieu of fried and served everything with a pleasant smile and friendly attitude.  I'm already planning a return trip to dig into the lumpia on the menu!"}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  The socially awkward cashier. Punch card is very specific to certain plates even if you're spending more. The random coin operated sticker/toy machine by the door.

LIKE  The availability of low carb options. The Hawaiian music playing in the background. Choice of mini or regular size. Shrimp fried rice. Location close to work.

LOVE  Nothing."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken cutlet and it was delicious.  The food here is consistent good job.  My friend ordered this a few days ago and it tasted the same.  Along with the same portions and it wasn't over cooked.  Will come back soon."}
{"text":"Great price for ramen and some veggies after a long day at work. Glad to discover another Asian place in the northwest!"}
{"text":"Cashier lady forgot to put my macaroni salad while she talks on the phone. First time they messed up my order."}
{"text":"As far as food quality goes, it is a typical L&L. I have never had a bad experience with their food. 

But the reason why I like this one so much, is that they always remember me. Every time that I go in, they ask me which one of my usual items I will be picking up today. (I'm pretty predictable, I have my favorites!) They always ask if its just me today, or am I picking up for my wife also. (They remember her favorites as well) 

So for me, this is my go to Hawaiian BBQ spot. I understand people will say they're better or more traditional spots, but the friendly staff and their welcoming attitudes will keep me coming back. (Now I just have to remember to keep checking in!)"}
{"text":"Portion size is good. However everything I seem to order comes out bland.  For instance I've tried the garlic shrimp twice to see if maybe it was the cook of that day that messed it up but in both instances, BLAND.  It does remind me of the food back home on the islands but its taste isnt there. Also, The malasadas were drenched in oil . And The wall on the side of the tables are filthy. It's an ok place."}
{"text":"Consistent, Yummmmmy food!!! Fast service and dependable for catering parties!!! Ive had their Hawaiian plate, chicken katsu, Musubis, bbq mixed plate, and they were all ono/delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I forget that this place is here sometimes but when I do come it has always been a pleasant experience. 

I was greeted as soon as I walked in and the cashier was very helpful in helping me choose what to order. I've been craving saimin for days so I opted for L&L saimin and a spam musubi.

Food came quickly and she brought it to my table with a smile. Despite lack of flavor in the saimin, I still got full. She asked if I wanted shoyu and hot sauce beforehand and I had said no. Less sodium for me. I hate musubis that have mushy rice and a small size of spam inside but the musubi here was pretty decent. 

I've also had their breakfast special here before with Portuguese sausage/spam, eggs and rice. Very satisfying when you're super hungry. Will be back for more food in the future when my boyfriend starts to crave their garlic chicken again. Delish!"}
{"text":"Fucking dumb fucks. If i wanted chicken katsu then i would have ordered that instead i ordered curry katsu and told me once my order was done that they had no curry. Wait motherfuckers imma get my shit!'m"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Food was delicious and prices were inexpensive. Food was fast and hot! Will definitely be coming back again. The garlic shrimp was superb!"}
{"text":"So yummy
Portions are huge! This was my first time going to this location and the food is bomb.com. no long wait and friendly staff. I ordered the chicken katsu with extra macaroni salad.my first time having katsu and I will be getting it again."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! I've been here so many times and am always so happy with my meal. I'm usually happy dancing when I eat food from L&L.

The shrimp curry is SO GOOD. Fried shrimp with Hawaiian curry, with pieces of potatoes, carrots, and white rice. I wish I could eat it every week. At only $7, my wallet could deal with it but not my waistline.

The spicy beef is really delicious, so flavorful, very thin cut and prepared with sauteed onions.
 
Shrimp tempura is yummy and comes with a great sauce for dipping. 

The bbq dinner is massive, and an incredible deal for $10. You get 3 different meats with this meal. How could you want more?

I love this place! I wish I could come here every week. It is definitely a treat.  You will receive fast and friendly service here. So great."}
{"text":"Ordered the bbq combo plate for my boys to share and I enjoyed a Kalua pork bowl! Super satisfied with our portions and it's delicious! Fresh fast food with the grill sizzling in the background!"}
{"text":"Great place. The girl at the register was very polite.  We got there 45 minutes before closing,  there were about 4 take out orders ahead of us and the girl from the register was running around giving everyone there order so quick.  I don't think we waited more than 10 or 15 minutes for our meal. There was four of us and we shared two meals. She came out with our food and already had extra plates and forks so we can share our food. Excellent service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Warning Hawaiian's False Advertising!

I didn't even want to give this L&L one star they are selling COD and trying to pass it off as Mahi Mahi, its BULL S#%&! after complaining they admitted it wasn't Mahi!
Be warned!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times since moving out West. My favorites are the mahi mahi over a salad and the chicken katsu. There are a lot of different options so your first time will probably be overwhelming as you look at the menu. The meals are definitely enough to share. Service isn't always the fastest but they haven't screwed me over yet."}
{"text":"Ordered take out yesterday, was ready in 10mins. The chicken katsu plate was good as expected but the Hawaiian Plate (laulau & kalua pig) wasn't as good as other L&L locations. Usually when I get their laulau it's wrapped in the Ti leaf still but this one was already opened for me (which could cause one to think if they really used Ti leaf to steam it or foil?) and it ended up a little I. The dry side. Also the kalua pig with cabbage was dry as well. It was more like roast pork shredded (think carnita) versus the moist shredded pork that is usually kalua pig to where there is still some liquid in it. But the flavors were on point, no shoyu needed on anything and portions were more then fair. So if u got the Hawaiian food craving this place works!"}
{"text":"Come here once a week. Good location. The spicy chicken or spicy beef are my faves.  Good service. Food always tastes good. Great for if you hungry and need something to eat right away.  Caesar da cook. Is da man! No.be scared to ask extra spicy."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! The most DISGUSTING thing I ever saw... I was the last customer of the night, and what did I witness????
I witnessed the owners or managers, pack LEFTOVER MARINATED RAW MEAT into their cars from the food cart, from the kitchen only covered with plastic seran wrap and packed it inside the trunk of their car? IS THAT EVEN SANITARY? That just screams SALMONELLA! I use I love their food, it's so good..... But now I know their special ingredient! I bought my food and THREW IT AWAY! I did not wanna get sick!  I been a happy customer there for a long time, but NOT anymore! I am never going back, EVER again. If you want to eat leftover, recycled meat........ Go eat there!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Hawaiian food this is the place! The food is delicious and they give you such a great amount of food. The service is quick also, ordered takeout and it was a quick just pay and go. They also do substitutions too! If you want to be a little healthier you can get veggies instead of rice which is really cool. I love the Chicken Katsu, always my go to!"}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time. Funny how I have not noticed them before and I drive around the area almost every day. They share a building with Five Guys Burgers, Pielogy etc. across Lowe's parking lot.

Came in around 1015am for some takeout and I'm impressed how clean the place is. The ladies were very friendly and I LOVED the soothing Hawaiian music. That music almost made me stay and eat lunch there instead. Ordered garlic mahi mahi with brown rice and a small ahi poke. The garlic mahi was really good, serving was good for 2 meals. It's definitely worth trying. It came with a side of macaroni salad which was good as well, lighter on the mayo than other places. The ahi poke on the other hand, it was ok. For almost $7, the serving was tiny. 

All in all, I loved this place. Will definitely come back to try their BBQ's , malasadas  and more garlic mahi but will pass on the poke."}
{"text":"For some really odd reason, this place only has brown rice one day a week.  Forget which day it was though.  But I am glad that they have health options such as the BBQ chicken and salad. It's really flavorful, and filling; I mean they give you like four slabs of BBQ chicken and if opt for no rice, they give you a nice salad portion as well.  I really like their dressing!  It's like a peanut sauce type of asian salad dressing; but its good!

The spam to rice ratio in their musubi is wrong.  Way too much rice!

But all in all, good place to get some BBQ chicken and chicken katsu. I don't like anything else on their menu."}
{"text":"I was in Hawaii last year and had the most delicious BBQ at North Shore's Grass Skirt Grill, so since then I've been craving some island food and I was pretty satisfied here.

I ordered the family a \"mini buffet\" To-Go so I could sample some of my favorites:
    Giant size fried shrimp, (a la carte)
    Crispy chicken katsu, (a la carte)
    Creamy mac salad, 
    Fluffy white rice, 
    Tasty shredded pork and cabbage (Meal-this came with rice and mac salad)

and it was all Fabulous! The sauce in the container was so good. I poured it over the pork and the katsu.  I think next time I may order the pork sans cabbage. 

Small dining room only about 7 tables. 

Friendly service, clean and lots of places to sit!  

What more do you want? Okay, besides the ocean breezes, the sunsets and tropical weather? You ask for too much!  This will do for now..."}
{"text":"Ate at this location recently and a handful of times last year. This place is just okay for me.  I actually prefer Hawaiian BBQ by my house.  But when in this area and in the mood for Hawaiian, then this hits the spot. 

I give this place 4 stars because the food is what I expect each time and the service is always good.

-Katsu:  Actually had a bad experience with their Katsu last year, but don't think it was their fault. Hiked Mt. Charleston in the middle of summer.  Ate here immediately after and got sick. But think it was more from dehydration.

-Spam Masubi:  Fresh, tightly wrapped, and pretty good.  

-Loco Moco w/Brown Rice:  My go to order.  Tons of protein and fills me up for at least 2 hours. 

TIP:  If ordering brown rice, it can take a little extra time."}
{"text":"We were greeting and charged by Joyce. Her attitude and smile made it very welcoming. The food is delicous. I recommend BBQ Mix plate."}
{"text":"I think the food is great.  Only setback if anything is that the menu seems to be eliminating things on some of the combos and prices are going up.  Service is friendly.  One occasion I traveled here after being on the road for an hour and a half and not eating anything all day.  It was 840 and then informed me they closed the kitchen because it was slow.  Only real negative experience though."}
{"text":"Thanks for opening up right by me.  I've been to other locations but this one is my favorite.  The cashier Mei is super friendly & helpful.  Walking in & being greeted by her smile name this great experience even better.  The food is great. & well worth the price.  You get huge portions. You also get a free drink with purchase, you can't beat that.  I had the Salmon & Garlic Shrimp & I highly recommend it.  This is a new location & they keep it very clean."}
{"text":"Had the Katsu Chicken Curry and got a Musbi... that is a LOT of food!  With the tea it was a little over $10 and believe me I was stuffed. It came with rice and the macaroni salad. The curry was awesome flavor and smothered the Katsu Chicken just right. This is definitely casual, sandal-wearing comfort food.  Lots of peepz going in and out with take out Musubi orders... they have several different kinds here."}
{"text":"***I must say again that the lady on the phone is so nice and accommodating.***
I enjoy the Mochico chicken here more than at other places I've tried it at. They now have fried wontons which is basically the filling in the eggroll (clear noodles,little bits of ground pork,minced veggies and lots of black pepper) filled into wontons and then fried. Yummers!!!!
My friend tried the siopao (stuffed steamed bun) and she liked it. I asked if they could put egg into my portuguese sausage musubi and they did and it was so freakin good dipped into sriracha sauce-Yeah Baby....
The last time we ordered for pick-up they forgot to put our butter mochi in our order but when we ordered again she remembered on her own that she forgot to put it in the last time and gave it to us. The butter mochi is a yummy sweet snack. Like my friend said it tastes like a cross between mochi and poundcake. They now have smoothies- the lady said it's juice,ice cream & crushed ice. So I got the Papaya smoothie and honestly I didn't like it too much. It was a bit tangy and I normally like tangy but I prefer my smoothies to be more on the sweet side but I'll try Mango next time.We will never stop ordering from here...."}
{"text":"I love Hawaiian food. I like the food from L&L. But I always have such varied experiences. Sometimes the food is excellent. Top notch 5 star worthy 100%. Other times, like tonight, it was just average. I ordered a chicken katsu curry bowl. It was a first for me and it combines two of my favorite foods, curry and katsu. I had high hopes for it. But the katsu was over saturated from the curry sauce and no longer brilliantly crispy.  That same curry sauce was more like a gravy with a hint of curry spice. I would have prefered something listed as  curry to taste as such. If it was to be just a sauce it would have been good. The vegetables in the bowl were soggy and over steamed. The rice was not bad but some more of the so-called curry sauce would have been a nice touch to the otherwise plain grains. The other part of my meal, my typical order of Spam musubi, was superb. The nori was tender. The Spam was just the right thickness. There was a perfect amount of teriyaki sauce. And the rice held together as it was the perfect stickiness. I will continue eating here. I will continue to order Spam musubi from here but I shall not order the katsu curry bowl again."}
{"text":"Although not very familiar with Hawaiian cuisine, I mainly go there for the pok√© and musubi.
The staff is very friendly, helpful and fast to get your order to the table.
I walked in there after having experienced  horrible service next door at Miga yet left pleased with the food and service.
I know there are other locations across The Valley, yet this one is solid."}
{"text":"Customer service is excellent. My family and I are now frequent regulars and enjoy the menu variety."}
{"text":"As a Kama'aina, and Now Living in Vegas, I From Time to Time...Miss Eating \"Local Hawaiian\" Food! It's good to know that there are a Few on the 9th Island, and L&L is One of them!

The Usual Plate Lunches I get are the Loco Moco (Hamburger Patties, Brown Gravy and, Topped with 2 Fried Eggs) ,The Chicken Katsu. All Plate Lunches come with 2 Scoops of Rice & a Side of Mac Salad, and they Also have the Mini Lunch Plates with 1 Scoop of Rice & Mac Salad!! They Also have Spam Musubis....I Know a Few of You Don't Like Spam....Sorry, but this Island Girl Loves it! But, they also have Portuguese Sausage Musubis, Chicken Katsu Musubis as well!

 Yes, I know a Few of you Don't Like Spam, Sorry...This Island Girl LOVES IT!

As I have Visited a Few L&L Locations around the Vegas Area, this Location is a Little Small, with Limited Seating. But, the Taste comes Very Close to the Local Hawaiian Eateries back Home!"}
{"text":"Best fish ever and excellent service. I love this place. Very clean and prompt. You have to visit and get s taste of some good food that is reasonable."}
{"text":"Great for a quick lunchtime run. They typically have specials that offer a lot of food for a small price. I love the chicken katsu curry and spam musubi. The loco moco is also delicious. Every meal comes with the typical side order of creamy macaroni salad. Definitely recommend this place for an authentic, yet fast taste of good Hawaiian fast food!!"}
{"text":"Really good deal if you buy a meal then you get free drink with that which is really awesome. The teri beef and teri chicken combo is good. This location is hidden inside a citi bank plaza."}
{"text":"one of the counter girls needs a lil' personality check...but overall they are way better than ANY Other L&L in vegas that I Like!!! always great food. :)"}
{"text":"The service was GREAT! Nothing like friendly staff to start everything off right. That definitely gave it an extra star. 
The food was just OK. I mean it was good, but it didn't really stand out. I guess this is a chain so it's hard to actually stand out.
We ordered the BBQ combo plate. The fries were pretty good for a Hawaiian BBQ place. Other than that the meal was enjoyable, but again pretty generic. Next time maybe we will be more adventurous and try something out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"The worst cashier ever! No greeting, no smile and no thank you! the food was good though."}
{"text":"I always love visiting his place during my lunch breaks. I usually go for the sampler plate/#3 which has huge servings for only $9.50"}
{"text":"So far this is my favorite l&l barbecue location. It was clean and nice inside. The hostess was very nice and friendly. She took my order and brought me my food. I ordered the mini short rib with a side of fried sunny side up egg. It was delicious and they gave me plenty of delicious meat and wasn't cheap about it. They have so many options for ordering here. I wanted to try the garlic shrimp but they only had regular size instead of mini so I will be back to try their garlic shrimp and other items. This location was great and it's right by my place. Price was affordable too. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Chicken katsu curry, macaroni salad,  and spam fried rice.  Life gets no better.   I'm afraid of the sodium levels the next day, but, who cares when you've got a mouthful of spam?"}
{"text":"The place did not seem clean and I was not impressed with the food. Good but not great. Probably will never return. The workers were nice though!"}
{"text":"I feel like this is just a place that can try a lot harder than they do. I feel like this is a place who can try even a little harder than they do to be \"good.\" But alas, they didn't in our experience. 

We went yesterday and either the woman taking our order was having one of those days where life is trying you, or she was just a crabby person. Even upon eating, I'd glance over just out of curiosity and I will say from beginning and end of my time there, not one smile... Not. One. But not even just singling her out. The people in the back popped out a couple times as well and it was just kind of uninviting as a vibe. Hopefully it was just an off day for them and thats not how they actually operate and conduct business.

Food was of pretty decent quality, but SUPERB quantity. I can take a 7/10 quality if there serving size is like 15/10. Absolutely. That's leftovers for days!"}
{"text":"So bad! I've been to L&L plenty of times before at different locations. This particular location was pretty terrible. The chicken was rubbery the beef was burnt and the macaroni salad was loaded with TONS of mayo!  Never again."}
{"text":"I love L&L !

Kalua pork & cabbage is my go to dish, but I have always enjoyed their chicken katsu, as well.  The curry has just a hint of spicy heat!"}
{"text":"I kept telling the girls in the front I wanted grilled ahi, but they kept saying mahi. I said it to them couple times, still, guess what I got? You guessed it, Mahi.  Its a different fish! Gaaaaaah, so mad. I walked away with the mahi and didn't want to even bother because I know there was a bit of a language barrier. It was busy and the counter was full of customers, plus I didn't have my handy husband to cool me down, so I walked away. Please know the difference between your fishes."}
{"text":"Hidden in the same plaza as Lowe's.  Service was excellent and parking was plentiful.   Food was delicious and was in big portions.  Glad there they had free healthy substitutions if you didn't want want white rice or macaroni salad."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to restaurants. The meals are very affordable for the portion that they serve.  Plus they serve brown rice spam musubi which is better in my opinion per glycemic index. They have wide selection of food and they also serve Atkins plates and healthy plates. They also have good customer service and serve free drinks for military."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm from Hawaii & I know you want my opinion on L & L.... This location L & L's is my favorite in Vegas. Yes, they have almost the same menu as in Hawaii. Now for a not so good news... I don't think any L & L's has Kanaka's or even Kama 'Aina's working for them, here in Vegas. While the staff is very friendly & the food is hot, for the most part, none of the staff has ever had a real plate lunch from Rainbow Drive-In, in Honolulu.

The main menu is very good. My favorites being the Laulau & BBQ Beef or Chicken plates. I love the Butter Mochi. Everything else is pretty good also. I will say some of the Asian items, you would be better off getting from a real Asian restaurant, like the egg rolls. The Madasada's are frozen, not made from scratch, but not bad. Another thing, the Ahi Poke, isn't even close to being Hawaiian, but I guess it would be too much to expect it to be made with Kukui nut oil & Hawaiian Limu. Still, overall a very good place for me to eat & day dream about being back home in Hawaii. This is as close as it gets to a real Hawaiian Fast Food Restaurant, without driving into Downtown to go to Aloha Specialties, in the California Hotel."}
{"text":"Bbq beef all day everyday. Been coming here for years and although the lady who used to work here was a lot friendlier the foods always great. Well actually I don't know if that's true since I've been getting bbq beef for 5 years."}
{"text":"I never had a problem here. I come in, order, wait, and leave. I normally do take out but when I dine in everything is fine too. Sad to see it doesn't have good reviews. I always order the chicken katsu curry. I tell them to put curry on the side because I don't like how they put it all over the chicken. It becomes soggy."}
{"text":"The BBQ chicken bowl is awesome! It's a great meal without a lot of calories which I save for the juice and desserts. The staff is helpful with recommendations and advice."}
{"text":"I usually LOVE this place, the lady that normally works the counter is very friendly and has memorized my order now  and she always lets me customize whatever it is I'm ordering, I love that! 

Three stars because of the very unaccommodating man at the counter. He wouldn't let me customize my order and insisted I order something entirely different than what I wanted. So in the end I didn't not order what he was pushing and didn't get what I wanted, nothing like a typical visit for me.

AND got home with the food to see it wasn't cooked correctly!"}
{"text":"The service is quick. Food is good and the portions are big just like back home in Hawaii..."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Service was great and food was delicious!!!! Had the combo with katsu and short ribs! I could probably eat a pound of the macaroni salad"}
{"text":"It's sad how this place has gone down the drain. I used to love L&L, it was my go-to for Hawaiian BBQ. This place needs a serious turn around. Starting with the nasty attitudes of the employees, if you don't feel like being nice to customers - why don't you quit your job and stay home? Don't give an establishment a bad rep because of your rudeness. The quality of the food is also bad. I had more skin than actual chicken in my BBQ plate and when I went to take it back the gentleman argued with me that all meat has skin and you can't cook it without. Really? Lol it's funny. Disgusting. Imagine biting into chicken and it being uncooked.  Never again.. Oh and don't go complain either because they'll treat you like an idiot in front of all the other paying customers."}
{"text":"L&L is a great place to eat, but the service that this specific location today was AWFUL. I called in a pick up order and when I was talking to the lady on the phone, it seems as though she was rushed and wasn't paying attention to my order and was very sarcastic and rude. 10 minutes later, I arrive to pick up my food. I asked her if I could double check if there's all Mac salad, which is what I ordered over the phone, and she said \"it's already packed up here you go\" and again I said \"is there all Mac salad\" she said \"no we already made your order, here you go.\" I asked her if she could make it correct and she ignored me and told me the price of my meal. COMPLETELY RUDE! If you're going to work in customer service especially a restaurant, BE KIND. The ONLY reason I am giving this two stars is because is because they have great food but at this specific location the customer service lady in the front horribly rude."}
{"text":"Smaller than the other L and L we frequent. Food was good as usual, get the chicken katsu and the bbq. Glad the macaroni salad comes on the side, not a fan but hubby is."}
{"text":"You get lots of food and they are always friendly so you can't go wrong with either of those things! However the food is just okay. I have had better and I much prefer Aloha Hawaiian BBQ, and of course that is a matter of opinion. 
However the macaroni salad here is always great!"}
{"text":"Usually out go to place when I'm lazy to cook.  Called at 8:30 and no one answered.  Called 3 times and even while on my way.  Get there at 8:45 and lady in the front says their closed.  I asked what time they close, and she says 9pm.  She says grill closed already!!! change your hours to reflect what time you close!  Or answer the phone so you can tell customers that your close before closing time so customers don't waste their time driving there!"}
{"text":"Been so long since I had L&L and I was craving some chicken katsu curry. Went to this location for the first time based on a high 4.5 stars on Yelp. 

Boy was I disappointed in the katsu meat. Not as white and lean as I like, but I can look past that. What I can't forgive is chewing on \"mystery\" hard parts inside the chicken - unforgivable! 

My girlfriend's BBQ chicken was not too bad, but salty. At least it was edible.
 
L&L stores that I used to frequent on the east side (one by The Galleria and the other on Nellis) used fantastic meat in their katsu. This L&L on Jones needs to follow their lead and stop passing off cheap meat..."}
{"text":"The food was great! I got a chicken plate and a side of beef. They have outdone themselves :)"}
{"text":"I have passed L and L Hawaiian BBQ many times and never tryed. Finally my co worker brought me some chicken katsu and pork lumpia to try. I loved it and have gone to lunch there now for the next two days after that. I have tryed the Kalua pork, laulau, aloha saiman and of course the spam musubi. Everything I have had was very delicious I even liked the Mac salad that comes with most dishes. If you like local Hawaiian food  you should check it out"}
{"text":"I love this place. I came here for the first time a week ago and have been back 3 times. The chicken katsu is my go to. Ill definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Garlic shrimp plate and small poke is my go to!! The garlic ship is breaded and fried and OMG it is so amazing. We love eating here because it is clse to the house and also you can call in you order and it is ready in 10-15 mins!! Just grab and go back home or to the park! 

The only problem is they do not open until 11... I want to eat for breakfast and I can not.. Still a good place to eat lunch through the night!!

The lady at the counter is always so nice!!"}
{"text":"Very clean, good service, great food, Hawaiian BBQ chicken was great.  Overall, tons of food at a very reasonable price.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"get the mixed BBQ plate, has the short rib and chicken, with 2 scoop of rice and a cup of macaroni, portion of food is large, taste ok, will come back and try other stuff.."}
{"text":"My first take out over on this side of town. Everything was ok, it tasted like a bucket of salt. I don't know if that's what Hawaiian food is supposed to taste like but I wasn't fan and neither were my family. I don't understand how this place has so many stars?"}
{"text":"I have tried a few Hawaiian food places here in N Las Vegas but I always find myself coming back to L and L.

Although it's not restaurant style food, the food just taste really good here, the quality of food is also good and it's not bad for a quick meal.

I also like that they put up the calorie count for many of the dishes they have and that is really helpful for someone that's trying to watch their calorie counts.

Overall just a good place with good food!"}
{"text":"I got food while I was on break from work, and was really craving some fries. I ordered the seafood combo with bbq short ribs. I asked if I could do fries instead of mac salad and the lady said yes. She rung up my order and all was great until I saw my reciet which said All Rice. I figured the lady misheard me since I'm soft spoken. I pointed it out to her that I wanted fries instead of the salad and she said ya all fry in her accent. So I was like OK whatever waited on my order and she said seafood combo all fry. I should have looked at my order before leaving. I sat down and opened up my order, lord behold my order was all rice. Maybe next time I'll be more specific and say FRENCH FRIES. I'm not sure how they would confused fries with rice... Food was all right anyway"}
{"text":"How to begin? They have really good foods here and price is very affordable! I'm thankful to have my quick lunch here. Stay busy!"}
{"text":"We go here every week! It's located in a great plaza with many options. We love ordering the katsu and the spam musubi. I'm not a fan of the saimin as the broth is not as flavorful as Aloha Kitchen's soup. But overall the food is good and tons of our favorite Hawaiian options. The poke is pretty pricey and spicy but I would order again. And I've never experienced a long wait time. As always, we'll be going back every week as usual."}
{"text":"I love l&l barbacue.Ive tried a couple of them in the las vegas area and there all great especially the one on w.charleston across from red rock hotel.But this one is terrible.The portions are much smaller and the food is not freshly cooked to order.They are a very bad example of l&l and should loose thier franchise.I would highly reccomend trying another location."}
{"text":"Very tasty!  Nice Asian fusion.  I've never had Hawaiian before.  I had Been to plate.  A bit of beef, chicken, fish and Spam (I do love spam)!  All on a bed of rice.  Mahi was moist with a nice crust, beef had great flavor and char as did the chicken.  Spam was spam and also crisped on exterior.  

Cashier was incredibly friendly and helpful.  Clearly she and cook get along well and I enjoyed sitting and listening to their banter- conversation"}
{"text":"The customer service is elite. I been coming to this location for so many years, but this last time knocked it outta the park. After a long day at work when it was a \"Murphy's law\" kind of day. I came tired, sick and hungry. (This place is never empty) I finally get my food to go because I have a kid to feed at home. I grab food which was so perfectly tied in bags by the lovely cashier and TWO steps out the door BOOM I drop my soup. 

The cashier (saw through the glass door)went into action and ordered the kitchen to get me a replica. I pulled my debit card to pay and she stopped me from handing it to her, and said \"it's okay\" I about cried because my awful day ended on a sweet note or should I say delicious saimin chicken soup. Yay!"}
{"text":"It's simple, it's quick. 

It's rice .and I'm Asian...

and uh, I kinda need rice everyday. 

 I would say it can be 3 stars-ok or 4 stars-good depending on what you order. I would say my favorite item would be the katsu, but to mix it up I think their BBQ plates are decent. Classic dishes like Loco Moco, Lau Lau, Kalua-  I've gotten and it's okay, but other spots I think do it better and are my go-to spots. 

If anyone is looking for homemade butter mochi or malasadas (plain or custard) , they offer them at this location and I haven't noticed them at the other locations about town. I havent gotten the malasadas, but the butter mochi was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Me and my husband frequent Hawaiian food joints all the time (we love Hawaii and we love their food!)  L&L falls dead center in our wide spectrum of Hawaiian places we've tried.  Not bad, not great.  

I feel like it's pretty hard to get spam and eggs wrong (one of my favs).  They do it fine (although I do feel that the spam is sort of thin).  Their loco moco (another one of my favs) is really meh.  The burger patty seems sort of thin and unflavorful.  Luckily, it's covered with gravy and that makes anything taste better!  Sometimes I feel like their BBQ is on the saltier side too.  Same with the saimin.  I totally don't care for their mac salad (its just macaroni and mayo... no other flavor!)  Aside from the negatives, its Hawaiian food.. meat, rice.  Always a good combo and satisfying to me either way!  Plus it's cheap.

In any case, they do Hawaiian food OK!  A luke-warm 3 stars."}
{"text":"Shoots! Aloha!

Missed you Yelp! It's been months since my last review, and why not come back with a 5 star.

Located inside the Home Depot plaza, there is plenty of parking for this sit down joint. Its very clean inside. A simple hawaiian theme with surfboards on the wall, and plenty of seating. To complete the theme is the island music playing in the background and great customer service. 

So to what I ordered. Fried Mahi Mahi Yuuuuuum! A melt in your mouth fresh fish dish served on a bed of cabbage, with 2 scoops of rice and mac salad. Can not go wrong with whatever you order here. Made fresh every time, all their dishes come out amazing. The Mahi Mahi was seasoned perfect and fried so that the meat was still tender and moist. Not greasy at all. Not dried like how most Hawaiian places do it. I've had their Loco moco here before and all I can say is \"seconds please!\" Oh and for all you healthy eaters out there, they have a healthy menu too.

Overall great spot for your Hawaiian cravings. I'll be back again and again. Next time kalua pork!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Of course L&L opens up right by my apartment now that I am planning to move soon. Stopped in today as it's been a while and this is a brand spanking new location. Staff was very friendly and the food is delicious.

Seafood Mix - fried shrimp, mahi mahi and chicken katsu with double rice instead of macaroni salad. Shrimp and katsu were delicous... haven't made it to mahi mahi yet as the freaking plate was enough to feed 3 people.

Cream cheese wraps - otherwise known as crab rangoon --- this location was giving out free ones for their soft opening and they were amazing... I could eat 6 or 12 of these :)

On my way home from work so this may be a regular stop... if you are not a big eater you could easily make 2-3 meals out of the combination plates. We plan to split one from now on. This location is so new it's not even on their website yet."}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu, chicken bbq, Can't go wrong with these two. Menu is huge so exploring new dishes would be fun. Beef dishes are nice too. Was voted best Hawaiian restaurant 2014, totally deserving of this honor. 
Aloha Beef is very nice, good cut steak saut√©ed with sliced onion. 
Calamari is a good dish"}
{"text":"Cashier is always pleasant, fast service and most importantly, yummy food with lots of menu and specialties to choose from!"}
{"text":"Always decent. Been eating here for years so it's always the same. From chicken katsu plain or with curry,bbq mix plates, the musubis,saimin (which is basically ramen noodles) to the burgers and loco moco and breakfast items like spam and eggs with rice. One thing they do really good to me is the Mac salad that stuff hits the spot and you can mix it with anything you eat here and it's so good!"}
{"text":"i went to the l & l hawaiian  bbq,  located at w. flamingo. 
terrible! !!! i ordered  the  bbq meat combo,  every meat that's  supposed  to  have any flavor,  didn't  have any! everything,  including  the  mac salad,  was bland! ! ! ! ! ! 
the portions aren't even worth the price you pay for it! !!!
very disappointed at how the l&l hawaiian bbq franchise has become!
thanks to yelp - i'll be more than happy to refer  people to 
\" island  flavor \" off the 215, s. durango. ....."}
{"text":"I'm from O'ahu, Hawaii. I'll just say its nothing like Hawaii food but it does the job . They give military personnel free drinks so that's a plus! The service is awesome prompt, courteous and very short wait times."}
{"text":"Pretty good Hawaiian food. Kind of slow. Mac was good. Katsu, garlic chicken, grilled chicken and Kalua pork were all good, nothing wowed us though."}
{"text":"On my most recent trip to Vegas, I decided that I was going to eat at different restaurants while I was down there and since I hadn't eaten Hawaiian barbecue in a minute, I gave L&L a try. I tried the katsu, spam musubi and on a separate trip I had the garlic mahi mahi with brown rice and salad. The katsu was ok - I noticed that the fat wasn't removed before they breaded it and fried it which grossed me out a little. Also, the mahi mahi wasn't cooked all the way through... I liked the macaroni salad, spam musubi and Hawaiian Sun beverages (pretty much like Arizona except island flavors). 

The customer service was good and the restaurant was clean. I'll probably find a different Hawaiian bbq spot next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The portions are great and I loved this location because of the customer service. The cashier is extremely kind I wish I got her name to give her a shout out but she was helpful and genuinely kind. Loved the food and love that their is a stamp card for purchases like a rewards card. The only thing that wasn't my favorite was the Mahi Mahi. Honestly the food is made to order and was really tasty loved the teriyaki sauce on the rice. I will take pictures next time I go because I forgot to before we ate. Favorite thing about this place is the service"}
{"text":"I've ordered to go and dinned in. Food is good. Service is good and fast. Never had a problem with my food. Must try their Hawaiian drinks !!"}
{"text":"Had their Hawaiian short ribs. I liked the flavor but they were a bit tough. I might give them a try again."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with L&L and their Menu. I have not been disappointed yet. Their Thai Tea is great, not too sweet or chemical tasting. Their Loco Moco is superb. Their BBQ Mix plate is delicious. Their Chicken Katsu is never too dry. The staff at this location is friendly and smile. 

One warning though...Their restroom is like one gigantic sulfurous stink bomb. I could barely hold my breath long enough to wash my hands before losing consciousness."}
{"text":"Enjoy coming here every now and then good combo plate that's nice to share with the wife. Daily deals aren't to bad."}
{"text":"The establishment is rather clean and located in a busy strip mall.  There are various number of other restaurants in the building, but a co-worker and I decided to try this location.  There were plenty of customers dining in, but there was no wait at the counter which was great.  I ordered the mini-spare ribs which comes with 2 strips of spare ribs, white rice and shredded lettuce along with a cup of macaroni salad.  The spare ribs had a lot of fat in it compared to similar dishes at other L&L Hawaiian BBQ restaurants in the metro.  The rice was cooked well, but the macaroni salad rather tasted warm.  Overall, it wasn't what I was used to in other L&L Hawaiian BBQ establishments."}
{"text":"Been here 2 times now. Friendly service and great food. What's not to like? Already tried the chicken katsu, bbq chicken and spam masubi. All were well prepared. I noticed they have alot of other different food options that they dont offer at otherel l&ls like cream cheese wontons. I gotta try that next time. 
+ the lady at the front counter is very nice."}
{"text":"worst food ever and customer service is horrible. so disrespectful to customer went in there and i got kicked out for saying my order was not right. she cursed me out and told to get \"f\" out"}
{"text":"Amazing food with huge portions. The whole family just loved everything about the experience. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"L&L is a popular Hawaiian chain. It's not the best out there especially in North Las Vegas. The smaller non-chain Hawaiian restaurants in the area have better food. But I'm still happy that we have this place as an option.

The location is quite convenient: Craig and Losee on the same side as Lowe's, Subway, Chipotle, Five Guys, etc. 

I like chicken Katsu and Spam musubi. They have a ramen/saimin  burger on top of the usual Hawaiian fare. They also offer \"healthier\" options: bbq chicken / garlic shrimp/ garlic ahi/ salmon patty with brown rice and salad - they're still oily but I guess, healthier than fries and a cheeseburger with bacon. It's Hawaiian food! The garlic shrimp on the picture has whole shrimps with shell but what you get is battered and fried shrimp but it is mighty tasty."}
{"text":"For some reason we wanted to eat Hawaiian food and we heard about this chain. It's more of a fast food joint than a restaurant so no need to dress up other than super casual.

Each meal comes with two scoops of white rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. Nothing extraordinarily amazing about either but still good pairing. We got the garlic shrimp and it's deep fried and then added with tons of garlic. If you are not a garlic fan DO NOT ORDER this!!!

Get the spam musabi! It has some cool sweet sauce which was a good pairing with the saltiness of the spam. 

Overall, cool meal to try but not something I want to eat a lot... maybe once every 6 months? Haha plus I think I can make most of these meals at home too but I'm just to lazy to make them. That's exactly what this is... lazy comfort food!"}
{"text":"Today I had the most interesting situation with my Saimin.  I couldn't tell if they had bad food handling practices and put the noodles on the burners before dropping them in the broth or if it was a fungus or mold growing on the noodles.
On top of this, this location is very..  conservative with the ingredients.   At my preferred L&L locations, when I order a musubi, there's usually an excessive amount of rice, which is nice, especially when you have extra sauce.   Here, they give a minimal amount, yet charge the same. 

Portion size I'd deal with.   Health concerns I can not."}
{"text":"Food is just alright if this is family owned they should be nice. As mentioned food is ok for Hawaii id probably go somewhere else the fish here is my least favorite.

Reason for review is the terrible service from the lady wearing glasses. Not sure to who she is but not nice in anyway if she's having bad days someone else should be helping not her"}
{"text":"I only got food in here because the Indian place I was gonna eat at wasn't open yet, and Albertsons didn't have any more naan to make my own Indian. Therefore I was not in the mood for Hawaiian, I sort of just settled on it after my laziness and hunger got the best of me.

I think Ohana Hawaiian is better. I got the mini Barbecue Chicken. It was a little greasy, but tasted good. The macaroni salad was okay (I like Ohanas' better). Rice was nice;) Staff was pleasant, service was fast. Price was good."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this L&L for years. Having a boyfriend from Hawaii means frequent trips here. Lol I have always had great experiences with customer service here. Lately it's been a very sweet woman who always remembers who we are. She is  very welcoming & is great! Their food is always made fresh!"}
{"text":"My first and last time, terrible quality and taste. Both of the chicken items had skin and fat still on it. 2 small scoops of rice with each $7.75 entree, you don't get much chicken here either, so lazy it wasn't even sliced. They give you a nasty cold Mac salad with mayo. This place has no decent sides to choose from, no noodles??!! I'll never go back to this place and have no idea why anyone else would either. Better food at the competition, try teriyaki madness or Panda."}
{"text":"If you're hungry for Hawaiian this is your place. The BBQ plates are always hot, fresh and flavorful. The chicken Katsu is bountiful, with such a large amount of chicken it can feed two people easily. The egg rolls are usually fresh and crispy as well as the wontons. I like to call ahead and order and the food is usually ready in 15 minutes or less. The staff are super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Shame they use the hawaiian name! Food is horrible service is even more horrible! We ordered simple items: BBQ \"beef\" sandwich, and 2 cheeseburger meals. After saying like 3x not BBQ burger...beef she still charged us wrong then after the transaction she rung us up again for the $1.15 diff!!! Ugh!!! Lesson learned....just gotta go Ohana Hawaiian Barbeque from now on.
Tips: spam musubi is $2.15 and skimpy skinny spam! Ohana has it for $1.85!!"}
{"text":"VERY UNHAPPY WITH THEM... TO BAD I CAN'T GIVE NEGATIVE STARS. So, I get there 20min before closing. They just got done taking an order for a couple. There was a family of four and another person dining. After we got done ordering for a party of four they decided to tell us it would only be to go. I was SHOCKED! It's not like there food is heaven sent. We will never eat there again. Not like they have a sign stating unable to dine-in 30min before closing to go orders only. I hope the owners read this!"}
{"text":"Defintely a great place to eat, if your in Las Vegas. Get the barbque mix plate, its the bomb. For all you hawaiianz out there. THEY GET LAULAU PLATE TOO."}
{"text":"This place is close to where I live, so I stopped in to grab some food. The quality was horrible. I won't go here again. I live in Centennial, and I will drive all the way to South East Vegas to eat at Ross J. Before I drive the five minutes to LNL Hawaiian"}
{"text":"After being completely unsatisfied with the L&L Hawaiian barbecue five minutes from my house, my daughter ordered food from this one near the cannery casino. Got home, and found two hairs in the chicken Kutsu curry. Won't make the mistake of eating at this restaurant chain for a third time."}
{"text":"Amazing, just like on Oahu.  The Katsu is fantastic and the service was awesome.  Try an aloha steak if you get the chance!"}
{"text":"I dont have a problem with the food, great portions great servings. My mom did have a problem with the cashier who she thought was rude and doesnt seem to like working there. If youre gonna work om the front greet just greet with a welcoming attitude."}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food.  I have a family of six,  kids are picky eaters but we all left satisfied and we got some free maladas?  (Not sure of the spelling but they are sugar doughnuts yumm!!). Kids like the BBQ chicken and spam eggs and rice, my husband and I had BBQ mix plate."}
{"text":"Really yummy macaroni salad, but very heart clogging. But who cares? It's awesome!

Before being a veggie I would get the BBQ here, which changed into the breaded fish, and now I just devour the mac.

The prices are awesome for the amount of food you get, and you get a lot! The mac the rice and the meat/fish with a drink for under 10$! Whootness."}
{"text":"I only really write reviews for places I have been to several times because consistency is important especially for what we consider fast food. This is not exactly fast food but we order for pick up and it's always good and the people are friendly. One meal is usually enough to share since we are not ones for leftovers. Roast pork is by far our favorite and the macaroni salad is yum also."}
{"text":"Ordered the Kalua pork 2 days ago and I've been sick ever since."}
{"text":"Ewe, do not order their BBQ Beef short ribs.  Trust this review or you will be just chewing and eating ligaments and fat that their plastic knife nor your own teeth can tear into.  I finally had to eat like a cave man, using my fingers to pull meat apart.  In addition their mac salad tastes like it was made with lard vs mayo.  You are better off going to Island Flavor."}
{"text":"Haven't ate at L & L for years due to a bad experience at the location off of Sahara & Maryland Pkwy.  This location has changed my mind and I've missed my Kalua Pork and Spam/Egg/Rice.  So far the food has always been hot, delicious and the customer service is what I would expect for this type of eatery.  Hopefully they won't fall down in quality like the other location did after they became popular.

**UPDATE 10-28-2015**
Well, L & L has succeeded in continuing the horsesh*t quality of food that made me stay away for several years and has come to bite me on the ass.  Ordered a simple meal of spam, egg, rice, nothing too complicated for a typical \"Hawaiian\" restaurant.  I use quotes as I've never actually seen a Hawaiian working there, so whatever.  The eggs were ordered over medium (i.e. slightly runny yoke) and when I got home, assuming my meal was prepared correctly, since it seemed to be a consistent place to eat at first.  The eggs were so overcooked, the yolks appeared similar in texture/visual to a hard boiled egg, not a fried egg.  Called them back and had to explain the issue twice, since once isn't enough for them, and they offered to replace it, but trusting the same \"cook\" (using that term loosely, as I highly doubt there's anybody working in that kitchen who graduated from culinary school) to prepare the same meal again, and expecting the same results.  Your welcome to play roulette with your palette but expect mixed results and maybe even not your order at all...

**UPDATE 11-08-15**
Attempted to eat here at the request of my gf (she knows my thoughts on the cook who's still working here).  My food was not cooked properly yet again, but her's was alright, but her Katsu Chicken was extremely tough/lots of fatty tissue to get through.  Now she's on the same page as I."}
{"text":"Saimin is one of the basics on a Hawaiian menu...you'd think it'd be easy to hit the mark but, alas, no. No moa flavor. Hell no moa even fish cake and den! They don't have veggies 'cause \"vegetables are expensive.\" For how much they charge I'd expect it to at least have taste! Oh how I miss Zippy's saimin. I'll have to stick with California Hotel for my saimin fixes. 

Honestly I usually come here for a quick kalbi fix...I never have issues with my kalbi or katsu...THANK GOD! 

On a side note, when you can tell someone is from Hawaii, talking small kine pidgin...small kine talk back, lol."}
{"text":"Did a take out order for the family all the food was delicious and they got it done in a timely manner! Been coming here for a couple months I've never had any complaints! Love the chicken katsu and they have a surprisingly delicious chicken sandwich!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my one out of two go-to L&L places after I'm done shopping around the area. They're not always consistent, so that's why I had to deduct one point from them.

Anyway, FOOD! I always order their regular chicken katsu. It comes with two scoops of rice, A LOT of chicken katsu, two cups of sauce, and a scoop of macaroni salad. Portion of rice is a little small, but I don't eat much rice anyway -- It may be a problem to some people, but not to me. They put a bunch of chicken katsu in the box. I swear, I never ever finish it. I wish they would add more sauce in those cups cos sometimes they're only filled 1/3 of the way :( Macaroni salad is always so good for the tummy and bad for the heart, haha.

Their service is okay. Some days I get a cashier person who is nice and actually SMILES and some days they're just grumpy and frowny. I'm actually BIG on people who smile. I love it when people SMILE. If your'e friendly and at least pretend to love your job, I will tip. If not, then well.. you get the hint. 

I would come back. There's this push & pull relationship that I have with L&L, so I'll definitely be back here for more of my favorite chicken katsu!"}
{"text":"I'm not an adventurous person, but I'm glad i tried L&L when i first moved to Vegas! I only usually order the chicken katsu but it's soooo yummy. It's about average cost for a lunch/ dinner, but their portioning is generous! This location it's awesome. They always have everything right and ready. Never had a problem or complaint."}
{"text":"Good place to stop by and get some food. Chicken Katsu is really great. Very good portions. Only reason I gave this place one less star is because the teriyaki sauce is a little watered down. I thought for a while that it was soy sauce. But turned it it's teriyaki. 
 But overall the place has great food and flavor"}
{"text":"Stopped at this L&L to grab dinner. Girl at the counter was friendly and my order was ready SO quick! Under 5 minutes for my food! It was within 30 minutes of closing and the food was all very fresh and delicious. Best location I've been to."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it no stars. I went to the Nellis location. It smelled like a sewer in there. I ordered chicken katsu and bbq short ribs. When I got home I noticed something black on top of my macaroni salad. I took the top off and there was a dead fly. I went back and got my money. Whoever made this order im sure saw the fly before putting the lid on it. Just gross. I wont eat there again."}
{"text":"I was surprised by just how big the normal serving of chicken katsu was. I would say it might be normal for an NFL offensive lineman but that is about it. The taste is ok--at roughly $10 for a large amount of food you're not going to realistically expect the highest quality stuff. But for a solid meal at a cheap price, this is a decent choice."}
{"text":"I had the BBO mix.  It was fine, nothing bad, but nothing memorable either.  This is typical of L&L everywhere, nothing special, but it will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"I live right around the block to this place and was born and grew up in Hawaii so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to Hawaiian style food. This place sucks. Everything seems like it's been cooked by a person with zero passion for his/her food. Chickens dry and soaked in teriyaki sauce, along with the rest of the bbq meats. The loco moco is bland and tastes like they used a packet of gravy from Albertsons. Curry has barely any meat in it and more sauce then anything, which is super disappointing. I grew up with authentic Hawaiian fusion food and this place doesn't come close to home. It sucks cuz I've been to l and l I Hawaii that did it right, but it seems like they didn't even try here."}
{"text":"Usually pretty consistent on the food, especially the chicken katsu with or without curry or the mix plate.  But I ordered the roast pork...they don't have a mini so you have to order the regular plate.  Ordered take out so when I got home, I noticed that it was really overcooked and pretty dry tasting.  It was also really spicy...wasn't sure if the lid fell off the pepper!  I think I will stick to something that I know they do well.  Live and learn!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place last night for the first time. We both ordered the BBQ Chicken Bowls, which were delicious. My only complaint is that my chicken was a bit fatty. I had to cut a good amount of fat off before I could really enjoy the bowl. The steamed veggies could have been more tender as well, but some might like their veggies on the crunchier side. You do receive an ample amount of food for the price. I couldn't finish it all. We are glad this is so close to our home. We will be back. 

Please remember to grab extra sauce!"}
{"text":"Terrible...
I came here for a lunch and wanted to test an Hawaii bbq restaurant  and you can be sure I will remember the result.
This is really bad and ribs are especially horrible.
I'm really not ready to take my tickets for Hawaii!"}
{"text":"Service was slow, food tasted average. I got the spicy chicken plate. Reason this is a 1, the food poisoning I enjoyed all night and into the next day."}
{"text":"Your island cravings available for a pretty penny.

L&L Hawaiian BBQ is a signature name here in Las Vegas, Hawaii and the west coast. I was first introduced to it after a day of shopping with some friends when I first arrived here and my initial experience was great! I've come to realize that it was my excitement at the idea that I could order Spam Musubi, Saimen, and Poki anytime I felt like it.

Over the years, however, I've come to realize that you pay a pretty penny for a lot of average food. Again, this franchise is well know (and widely available) across Las Vegas with some pretty aggressive competition from other smaller, family owned Hawaiian BBQ location. The food is acceptable at most locations but sometimes you'll pay for a hearty alan of fat and not enough rice to accommodate it.

In all honesty, I enjoy the occasional visit to this rather \"homey\" location. The service is quick and the food is made to order (with the exception of the cold dishes and rice). Plates and single orders are available as well as party platters and \"to-go\" orders. Call to order is available but don't be upset if the operator taking your order is slightly rude... He or she is also manning the orders and payments at the location. So, overall, I gave three stars based on the price and the not-so-consistent outcome of some of their menu items.

Still an amazing taste of home for those Local Boys and Girls missing the islands. And if you're looking for something new, Hawaiian BBQ has a little of everything for everyone!"}
{"text":"All L&Ls are pretty much the same. The food is consistent no matter what location you go to. The only difference that I noticed was that some locations put way to much rice in the Spam Musubis. Although it's not the best Hawaiian food in the city, they have many locations and the food is good enough. 

Things I like about this location:
-Quick and convenient: I usually call in my to go order and my food is already ready when promised.
-Friendly staff: The two employees that I have seen working in the front have always been very nice and don't mind giving you extra sauce when requested. They also promote their stamp card: buy 9 regular plate lunches and get the 10th plate free! I know that other locations have this as well, but they don't care to tell you about it. 
-The restaurant is very clean.

What I hate about this location:
- The area is kind of ghetto. I have seen homeless and some weird people hanging out at this plaza so be careful!
-The parking: the parking stalls right in front of the restaurant are tiny. If someone else parks next to you, good luck trying to get in and out of your car!

Overall I like this location, but its too bad that the area doesn't seem very safe."}
{"text":"Not really one of the better L&L locations. It's small, not super busy. I was in the mood for some kalbi (when am I not?) and we headed over to the closest place to my house.

My fella and I shared a kalbi plate and a chicken and a spam musubi. The food was pretty plentiful. Not the best cooked or cut of kalbi I've ever had, but it did in a pinch. The mac salad (which I'm not really a fan of typically, anyway) had a little too much mayonnaise for my taste. Musubi is a solid choice, but it's hard to mess that up.

All in all, just ok. Close and it'll do in a pinch, but not the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I love it cause its so close to the house and the food was really good. But the person taking the order did not make eye contact with me once. The food took longer than normal. And when I received my order, I kindly said, \"thanks. have a good day.\" He ignored it and said next in line. No bueno. First impressions are big when eating at a spot."}
{"text":"First time at this location. The lady at the register was super friendly and the chicken katsu is on point!"}
