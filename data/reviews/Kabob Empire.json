{"text":"The best Kabob I've ever tasted, very authentic and really great compared to other Mediterranean places."}
{"text":"Worst gyro I ever ate. Couldn't even finish it. The meat didn't even taste like gyro meat. Horrible! I threw it away!"}
{"text":"Is the worse place I ever eat in my entire LIFE 
Meat is overcooked rice dry no flavor 
Is not worth it for the price"}
{"text":"Terrible experience! Bought a chicken gyro wrap as a side of rice. There literally was no chicken in my sandwich. A few bird-sized pieces and tons of onions. The rice was hard, couldn't even eat it. Way overpriced for what you get plus the wait for your food is an eternity! I had to wait almost 30 min for my food and there was nobody in the line how hard can be to make an onion wrap with no chicken. This place is an embarrassment to the Venetian Hotel."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, extremely disappointed.  At first, everything seemed good, friendly employee and smiling owner, expensive vegas-looking menu, and big flames on the grill. Even though the cashier was friendly and smiley, you could tell she was a newbie, which was perfectly fine with the owner hovering; however, you really shouldn't have a newbie cashier if she's never had the food before. 

We asked if the rice was flavored or plain white rice because fries would be better if it was the latter, she said it was \"flavored\" with spices and butter while looking over her shoulder at her boss every few seconds. 

Anyway, placed an order for a Beef and Chicken skewer with \"flavored rice,\" a half order of hummus, and an extra side of pita, and 2 cups of ice water while we waited. Everything for almost $20. (By the time I realized she charged me for 2 cups of barely cold water, I was too nice to bother, even though I should because that wasn't right to charge me for water when there's no signs or notifications. They didn't charge people for cups of ice but charged me for water.) Before we placed our order, we were watching the grill master and the kabobs, and they looked huge! So huge, we thought maybe they actually did hook it up at the price point. 

But when we opened the box, we were in shock how small the portion of kabobs were....soooooo disappointing.... 3 dinky pieces of somewhat-chewable-beef and tiny blocks of dry-underseasoned-chicken. Like what the heck... It also came with pickles and a roasted tomato. The rice was terrible, not even \"flavored\" or close for that matter. The rice was also not very tender and quite hard. At least it was semi-cooked to order.

Hummus and factory-made pita was okay, had we known it came with pita, we wouldn't have ordered more pita. Hummus was more on the chunky side versus the smooth, luscious kind. So it was ok, it also didn't taste  like it was made in-house though. 

Then, before we went back to our room, I wanted a side of tahini. For some reason, everyone looked at me like they had no idea what I'm talking about. I just wanted some plain sesame paste that you used to make your hummus, if you actually made it... Anyway finally they figured out what I was asking for, the falafel sauce they said...and I said sure, ok. It took all 3 of them to figure out how much to charge me for it. I get this itty bitty sauce cup, maybe an ounce of tahini, it cost me another $1.09. 

 At that point, I was calling to the kabob gods that the food better be delicious.... 

They never answered my call.... maybe I didn't call them loud enough...

2.42 stars for overpriced miniscule kabobs, hard white rice, outrageous hidden iceless water fee, and pretty much treating me like a stupid consumer. Ugh. Never again, should've gone to the Indian food stall with the hella long line..."}
{"text":"A damn good gyro and fries combo that's worth the price and wait. I'd definitely come back and try something else from their large menu."}
{"text":"Just okay food.  This was the only thing in the food court I felt like eating and I typically love Mediterranean but this was ehh.  I got a gyro plate which came with a choice of salad, rice or fries and hummus.  I wanted both rice and a salad but they would only let me choose one and didn't have a side salad option.  I was told it also came with a roasted tomato and picked cucumber so I went with the rice.  There was no cucumber so that was a bummer.  The gyro was good as was the hummus but the rice was not.  It tasted old like it sat in a refrigerator over night then was microwaved.  The staff seemed nice and the service was super fast.  I paid about $13 plus $1 tip.  There was plenty of seating available but I brought my food to the room."}
{"text":"I got the BEEF PLATE and it was de-licious! Meat was a bit over cooked but the flavor was on point. Grab a side of their tabouli--it's really good."}
{"text":"Honestly, I first thought it was the least worst option since it's in a food court, but it turned out to be pretty delicious. It's tucked away in the Venetian Some distance from the canals and above the Sans Expo floor, but it's not hard to find if you've been here a lot. Anyways, They give a fair amount for what you pay for and service wasn't to bad.

Got #45 which was the original Gyro plate. Honestly for being in the food was what I expected of a Gyro place, while it's more expensive than the Chipotle or the other fast foods here, it's comparable to other Mediterranean places.

The Gyro plate came with a cooked tomato, which actually tasted sweet and crispy. The Gyros were good and the sauce was on point. For being in the Venetian, this place is in a good spot for a quick bite."}
{"text":"So far no food poisoning signs (1 hour after swallowing)
Worse kabob ever I tasted. $85 for just 4 order. I'm Persian the land of kabob. The food that this restaurant delivered was just a salty black burned meet. Do not even think to order."}
{"text":"Awesome gyro and fries everything was super fresh. Homemade tzatziki sauce is killer. Very friendly service also. Keep up the good work. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here while walking through the Venetian. I ordered the chicken and beef skewers dinner. The food was great and came with rice, humus and picketed turnips. The hummus was delicious and went great with the meal. They give you a lot of food and wasn't too expensive for Vegas. If you're in the mood for some reasonably priced Mediterranean food I'd recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I absolutely love gyros. Coming here did not change my opinion on why I love Greek/Mediterranean foods. I had the chicken gyro wrap on white pita wrap along with mozzarella sticks and tzatzik with pita. Order was taken quickly, food was big portion size for what you pay for and food was great! I recommend chicken/beef or lamb gyros for anyone who wants a new taste and needs recommendation! The white sauce they use is the BOMB!"}
{"text":"I'm Persian so I've got high standards for kabobs.
I got #36 ground beef kabob. It tastes ok but too many fat chewy bits in there.  I gave it to my bf to finish.  I wish I could substitute tsatsiki for the pickled stuff. And I'm not sure why it comes with a side of hot marinara sauce... but compared to the rest of the stuff here,  this was good"}
{"text":"Got a little hungry while walking around the Venetian, so I stopped by this place for a quick bite!
Definitely wasn't quick at all, took about 15 minutes to get my food and they weren't even busy. 

Bright note, food is delicious!  Got their Chicken Gyro with fries. Grab a lot of napkins because it can get messy."}
{"text":"Want to wait 30 minutes for food court food? Try this place! Want mush tabouli that's been made a week before? Or pay for hummus that from a can? Then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Had a cheese steak there. Not bad, but nothing to rave about, either. Pretty good option if you want something quick but hearty."}
{"text":"Alright, we stayed on the Las Vegas strip this past memorial day weekend and needed to find good food at reasonable price. We found the Kabob Empire ordered number 44 which is a beef and chicken kabob plate with rice. It came with a special garlic sauce and humus. Everything was delicious, so much so that we cane back the next day and ordered the same item; and again, everything was just as good as the previous day. The guys were very nice, the service was fast and the food was the best. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch during a convention I was attending.  From the hummus to the chicken plate to dessert, everything was fresh and delicious.  The person behind the counter was able to explain the differences in how my chicken could be prepared, which I appreciated greatly.  Once I got back to the convention, everyone around me was jealous of my healthy, flavorful lunch - I had to slap a few hands away!"}
{"text":"First time having a gyro wrap, overall it was tasteless. So i do not know how a good gyro wrap is suppose to taste like."}
{"text":"30 minute wait for my food. Some lady cashier was a jerk, my wife asked what was the most popular dish, this lady rolled her eyes and said, \"Gyro\" that was it. 
Customer service is horrible and food not nothing special, this place needs to go out of business.. 
Don't wait your money eating here."}
{"text":"Worst gyro I ever had, gave me all the burnt end pieces and my wife's salad had mold. Should be closed by the board of health sorry to say."}
{"text":"BEST GYROS ON THE STRIP!!! Now known as Angelina's Grill, located in Venetian food court, great customer service and phenomenal food! The most bang for your buck hands down..."}
{"text":"We ate here  during our trip. TWICE. And we were here for only 2 nights. Located inside the Venetian Food Court. This is the place to be if you just can't see yourself spending a hundred bucks on a buffet for two when you know you won't be eating your money's worth. 

The kabobs at this place are delicious. We had the chicken and meat one with rice, pita and hummus. For about $15, you've got a filling lunch. And their garlic sauce is so bomb. 

Service was adequate. They give you a pager when you order your food and you go pick it up from their counter when it beeps."}
{"text":"If I could give this establishment \"0\" stars I would. This has been the absolute worst \"middle eastern\" food I've ever tasted. What a shame! This place is in the Venetian how can they let crappy businesses like this run? The server \"Sandra\" was friendly but everything else was horrible. The wait time. Over 20 minutes for something that takes no more than 5-7 mins. The taste of the rice was nasty. The usual \"white sauce\" that comes with kabobs was super thick and not at all like it should've been. The tomato was completely burnt yet still served. I did not want humus but it still came with humus.  Oh and they charge \"60 cents\" for a cup of water.. claim it's a charge just for the cup? Bs"}
{"text":"Hello, K A B O B!

So, this place is in a food court at the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes. 

Ian wanted a Pizza so, the Mrs. and Ian placed an order from Social Life Pizza. After looking at all the available options, I felt like a Kabob. So, I decided to dine from here. I placed my order, and a buzzer was handed to me. The very strong buzzer went off within 10 minutes. *laughs* I picked up the piping hot food, Tapatio sauce, plastic cutlery, Paper towels and proceeded to have a wonderful meal.

I had the following:
Original Gyro plate with Rice and White Pita ($9.99)
Half order Hummus with Pita ($2.99)
1 Pepsi 32 Oz (3.50)

Total with tax came to $17.83

Pros:
Very friendly employee and a knowledgeable owner at the counter?
Food is being prepared fresh. The skewers of Kabob's over the fire is an appetizing view behind the counter.
Gyro was delicious. 

Cons:
Holding the Gyro wrapped in the Pita was a tad bit difficult. Should ask the stuffing separate if you do not want to leave a mess around your mouth. Trust me :)"}
{"text":"had the chicken kebabs absolutely amazing the rice and chicken very fresh the Nan was delicious.  Everything on the plate was fantastic.. Guy at the counter was very helpful to assist me in finding the perfect meal for myself"}
{"text":"The gyros was NOT good AT ALL. Not only did it not have flavor but there was barely any meat on it. They are very stingy with the meat. And the fries were undercooked and soggy. I threw it away it wasn't worth the calories. Steer clear."}
{"text":"So..I ordered a gyro..
Supposed to come with rice, and either salad or fries.
I asked if they could sub. Extra salad for the fries- ok no problem.
The cook must be having a BAD day..
I get less than 3 bites of lettuce..1/2 of a cucumber..little tomato,  and raw onions.
AAARRGH!!!
So on to the gyro..meat seasoned well..good sauce..but MORE RAW ONIONS!!!
if you live onions..and cucumbers..this is your place..
I won't be back"}
{"text":"Do not get the kabob here. So disappointed. Had to wait 20 minutes for overcooked and gristly meat. Spat more than half of it out. The rice was old and the white sauce was oily and chunky"}
{"text":"Food was reasonably priced and location was great. Two complaints, they need better quality gyro meat and should provide  free extra taziki (which was very good) because the gyro was dry."}
{"text":"WORST HOTDOG I've ever had in my life!! I got a hot dog here since it look fairly decent on the menu picture, and I also didn't think you could mess up a hotdog. The bun was cold straight from the bag, kind of stale, and way too big for the hotdog. The hot dog clearly wasn't grilled like how it showed in the picture on the menu, it was probably put on the microwave. The fries were decent, but bland."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Huge box of food for $12 in Vegas? It is possible. Hubs and I couldn't decide on what restaurant to head to for Dinner during our shopping spree in the hotel so hit up the food court instead, he went to the nearby Indian place while I came here.
I decided to go for the Chicken wrap with Salad instead of Fries which was cooked to order in great time with friendly customer service. The wrap itself was a good size albeit poorly wrapped but with good flavors and lot's of delicious sauce. The Salad was a bit of a let down though - Just lettuce with a little Cucumber and Tomato, no sauce. I feel for a Greek place they really should offer some kind of Yogurt dressing for the Salad (Like Tzatzki) maybe even some Feta Cheese. Otherwise and good place to hit up if you want food quickly and on the cheap."}
