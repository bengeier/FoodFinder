{"text":"Marky's has been around for as long as I can remember. How they have managed to stick around for all these years is beyond me. They have never gotten my order right. There is always something missing. However, they are open late every night, except Friday. So, if you are having the munchies and are in the Bathurst and Wilson area, this place will do. Just don't put too much detail on your toppings, you will only be disappointed when you see that they forgot half of what you ordered."}
{"text":"Their mustard quality and amount of meat per sandwich got a huge oh yeah from my stomach.

The cleanliness and decor.... wom woM woOoOom!

The service was great - I would go again, but like others have said, I would get takeout."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting.  Aside from their bland freezer crappy overpriced fare, it is also dirty and dingy.  You can tell a lot by the grime on the tables and the dirty washrooms.  This place is definitely not kosher."}
{"text":"Marky's makes an decent but not great corned beef sandwhich. Latkes are good if you like very greasy ones that are thin and dense. I've found that people who like yitz's latkes do not like marky's as much. A sandwich and fries is about $12 but one can get far better deli a couple of blocks north at Pancer's."}
{"text":"Markey's is a great all around deli, meat restaurant to suit most peoples needs. This is not a fancy place by any means, but the casual setting with good quality food makes for an enjoyable evening. 

The deli meats, and steak sandwiches are very good. I especially like their chicken fingers and french fries. They have great sauces and the service is quick and friendly. The large spacious dining room is big enough for families and wheel chairs alike."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I was at Marky's 2 weeks ago and I will be back February 22nd..can't wait to have the awesome Spare Ribs! Best kosher deli in Toronto. I travel there a lot and would highly recommend the food to anyone! Keep up the great work...see ya eext week!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, but unfortunately, Marky's is closing for good July 18th. I am very disappointed, this place has been around forever.  Very sad to hear this place is going out of business."}
{"text":"One final review for this place.  We were there in early July and didn't realize they were going to close, although it was rather empty at lunchtime.  Everything we had was very tasty, including: matzo ball soup, corned beef sandwich, potato knish, etc.  Sorry to read it's now closed!  RIP!"}
{"text":"If I were to make a list of places to go for a meal, Marky's would be near the very bottom. I usually am dragged there if I have not thought of a good reason to join my friends there.

The food is sub par in terms of the quality I have found hair in my food before there. The service is non existent and the experience is usually the same (displeasing).

I've gotten the Chicken Soup (lacked flavor) and the wings (they were wings...just not good ones) and a variety of their sandwiches. Some of the sandwiches are decent but overall are not good enough to justify going there.

Also, Tips for wait staff should never be suggested by the person running the till. I usually tip out of social expectations, but to immediately judge me on the spot to say that I SHOULD be tipping and HOW MUCH I should tip Is a HUGE red flag. It's not my problem if you don't pay your wait staff enough.

Save your money, don't go. There are better places in Toronto."}
