{"text":"Hidden gem. We ordered the eggplant dinner and the chicken breast dinner. They came with rice, bread and a fresh salad as sides. Everything was super flavourful and great."}
{"text":"Wicked food ...love the kebab and house doogh! Even though I moved to Markham I still make it out to this place when I am in the area to get myself a shish kebab to go. Decent prices and hope they open a place at Markham:)"}
{"text":"With at least 10 missed check-ins, I want to say the food is as good as it ever was, as is the service.  New dishes are rolled-out, periodically, and the staff will gladly recommend something, or adjust a dish to suit your tastes.    I'm thrilled that business seems to be good and they're still thriving!  It's the food \"quality\" that I appreciate, most of all.  I stick mostly to the salad and vegetable sambosa (with those delicious sauces!), but my husband continues to try different menu items, and has not been disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken breast and the sultani (beef tikka and shish) kebab meals. The beef was juicy, shish ok and chicken not so. The owner/chef came to our table to personally explain the 2 home made sauces which imo were pretty good.  Now, I think the prices in the menu have gone up a dollar.. but the lamb meal item has gone up $3 to 14.95 from about a year ago (based on one of the pic posted here). Anyways, I think Bamiyan Kabob is better but Bamiyan is well established and has several locations. We were in the neighborhood and decided to give it a try. No regrets. Nice decor .. Kinda serene on a Saturday night unlike Bamiyan - which is like a war zone esp with the order takers shouting out the order #s when the food is ready.  Will definitely come back to try other items in the menu."}
{"text":"This place is genuinely great. It's nice to have a Bamiyan Kabob sort of thing in Ajax"}
{"text":"Be careful those who order any type of chicken . I was a regular customer ,I go about 6 to 7 times a month . They served rotten smelly chickens.I got sick ended up at ER rouge valley hospital.On top the don't accept there mistake ..give it a try yourself Also they  charge so much for so little food compare to all other Afghan food."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and quite liked it. A very popular lunch spot, it seems. The rice was amazing! Super flavorful and perfectly cooked. The Beef Tikka Kabab on the other hand was overcooked... Unfortunately. Chicken Tandoori was nice and spicy, flavorful and juicy. Salad was lightly dressed and a nice addition. Naan bread is thicker than Indian naan, but hot and delicious. Also tried the Sambosas which had a meaty filling and well seasoned.  The owner came over to our table and introduced himself and inquired how we liked our meal. He spent some time chatting with us and answered our few questions. Very friendly! It's the little things that make all the difference."}
{"text":"Authentic afghan food. One of our favourites when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Nice place,  great food (I love the rice and kabab) in addition to the great service and speed I love the store layout for groups and family.  Will defenitly be visiting again."}
{"text":"Consistent and fresh...great food, once a week for sure Friendly staff and is always satisfying"}
{"text":"No doubt an excellent choice when it comes to trying new food! Always loved Afghan food! This place was by far the best when it came to their Kabobs! There was so much flavor in the meat! Taste was 10/10 Would definitely recommend if in the area!"}
{"text":"While on an extended visit to the Ajax-Pickering area, life circumstances required that we eat a lot of convenience and take-out foods.  Desperate for something real and cooked with love, we thankfully discovered Maimana Naan and Kabob, tucked away in a random plaza on highway 2.  We weren't sure what to expect from this Afghani outpost in the suburbs, but the food was an amazingly delicious surprise!  More familiar with their Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Tibetan, and Russian cousins, I found the mantoo (steamed dumplings filled with meat, spices, and onions, and topped with an herbed yogurt sauce) surprisingly good, with a light and ethereal quality I hadn't previously associated with Central Asian food.    The eggplant borani was really delicious and well-balanced.  My Dad, not typically a fan of this cuisine, would send us out just to bring him back some beloved eggplant.  We knew for sure it was made from scratch with love the day we came looking for some and the owner told us he had run out but was making more -- a process that would require 4 more hours.  The kabobs that we tried (often distracted by other things) were nicely spiced and moist, and the rice accompaniment is also flavoured such that it could almost stand on its own.  The ferni (sp?) pudding was a light and gentle finish after the complex flavours of the main dishes.  Overall, this is a really welcome source of deliciousness in Ajax, and I wish the owners every success.  4* for excellent taste:price ratio and 1* bonus for being that good in such an unexpected location."}
{"text":"Had the lamb, cooked really well and juicy. Also had the shish kebab, it was prefect. Service was good too."}
{"text":"Nothing special,  small pieces of meat in the Mix Kebob, alot of spices. Asked specifically for garlic naan, instead got plain, even though we were the only costumers in the restaurant. Intrigued by great reviews, turned out mediocre. If you are looking for something great like the reviews say, pass on and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Our group of 4 dropped by after our friend's wedding ceremony around 2pm on a Saturday. The weather was a little chilly, but the restaurant quickly gave us the warm reprieve we desired.  Restaurant size: Cozy; as others have mentioned, there are 3 booths (each booth seats approx 4-6 depending on Human Size), along with a row of bench seating+tables, and a small row of tables.  Portion size: Surprisingly adequate! The friend who ordered the lamb chop kabab (rice, salad, naan) felt full and was very satisfied. The rest of us ordered a standalone tandoori chicken wrap and 2 tandori chicken wrap combos. Based on appearance, the wrap (compared with Bamiyan in Richmond Hill) looked thinner, but was filled with chicken and veggies and was quite filling paired with the fries. Oh those starches...  Instead of the can of pop, you can opt for a nice hot cuppa green/black tea.  Food quality: Lamb was cooked exactly as requested (medium). Chicken tandoori was soft, juicy and flavourful. It was nice having our own table sauce tray.  Service: Fairly basic and straight-forward; order, sit down, pick up when called...  One of the staff came by to check up on us, which was appreciated. We weren't too sure if we were required to clear our own table, but we did it anyway, making sure NOT to accidentally throw plates into the garbage bin!  Final thoughts: Had a great atmosphere and very delicious food. If you're hungry and in the area, be sure to drop by!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. When in Ajax we always go here if we can. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. The food is perfectly spiced and flavourful. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Great food and amazing quality. It is definitely a must try. I always get chicken breast plate or salad as I don't like spicy food. Oh and definitely try the fermi. It's a delicious rice pudding dessert that just hits the spot"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area, and stumbled upon this place. Great food, lots of flavour, and it's something different ethnically in the area.   If you are a fan of middle eastern food, this is something you should check out. The staff is friendly and helpful.   I was introduced to bamiyan kebab from a co worker, this place 10 times better with a lot more flavour."}
{"text":"Amazing menu. Amazing people. Amazing food. What more can I say?!  I got the mixed kabob which included three different skewers, a heaping pile of rice, a fresh salad, and sesame seed naan. I also got the firni which was nicely sweet but definitely not too sweet. Also got to try the house doogh, a delicious and refreshing salty yogurt and mint drink which accompanied my spicy sauce really well. It's definitely a unique drink, you want it to be sweet but think salty!   The family was also so nice to me, everyone was smiley and chatted with me while I waited for my to go order. They were so personable and jovial, really added to my experience. I would return to this place for that reason alone."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place and found the food to be great.  The place is super clean, food presentation is great and it tastes great. However, my turn off was when I saw the owner handling cash and then returning to the kitchen to prepare food without washing his hands. Will have to debate whether I will return."}
{"text":"I love this place, the best chicken tandoori around. Give it a try and you will not be disappointed. I'm lucky that's it close by, if it wasn't I'd drive to it because it's worth it"}
{"text":"Restaurant is comfortable with contemporary feel, simple three booths, and two long bench booths with  5 tables, cash and serve, all made on spot, water is served via cold pre filled bottles. Cups plastic; music ethnic instrumental, picture of menu included, I have ate kabab and Mantoo food portions are worthy it's price however extra sur charge on sauces is not necessary, as salads is made I front by same cashier, gloves are recommended, as for desserts haven't had it yet, food is pretty fresh, they have not perfected the rice but salad portions are pretty big pieces. Their missing cilantro which is huge in most Afghan restaurants I have attended.  Three team chef on Fridays- weekends nice lighting would recommend to try it yourself"}
{"text":"I love the food here, although price seems slightly higher."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat with family. Service and food is amazing. When you order plates they always give you salad and naan. This place never disappoints"}
{"text":"Wow, let me say, very good food. I had the Tandori chicken with a side of eggplant and it did not disappoint. The dinner/combo portions are large, they come with salad, naan and rice, so don't order more than one! Unless your sharing!  So my friend that speaks \"Farci\" was with me and said the food was not 100% authentic, but he said it's very close!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, I ate the mixed grill kabab, tikka, chicken and shish kabob!  Clean place, great staff!"}
{"text":"I literally found this spot by a reference from one of the stores adjacent from here.  I was shopping, I was hungry, and the store owner literally told me I need to eat this food, and literally walked me in!!!!  It takes a lot to become one of my go to spots...But this is it!  The food!  The food!  The food!  Ding ding ding ding ding!!!  I have recently moved into Ajax, and make this my once a week take out spot.  Two brothers from Afghanistan opened this place up.   They not only offer great food, but excellent customer service that we miss these days.    They are also the type of restaurant owners that show up everyday, work their own kitchen, care about the quality of their food, and really make a tasty meal.  Best is their chicken, but I will eat almost anything they cook.  I also agree with Nick I am hoping they find a following.  People really ought to not spend money on fast food when food like this is readily available.  Friendly little strip mall area where even the strip mall people have to go eat.  So long as you have a taste for well marinated foods, I would say go in and check this out!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"BEST grilled shish kebabs. lamb chops, tikka HANDS DOWN!!! The Eggplant Borani is a must try too! My husband and I have tried almost all their kebab meal in this restaurant and we just kept coming back, food quality is excellent! Meat is grilled to perfection, very tender!! The owners are very friendly!! You can never go wrong with a kebab meal at Maimana!!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up on Middle Eastern food, and my husband adores it as much as I do. I hope this place has enough business (location considering) to be around for a long time. I ordered the tandoori chicken with rice and salad (spicy kick!) and my husband ordered the beef kebobs. I thought the food was as good as homecooked, not too greasy or salty. My husband is more picky than I am and agreed it's excellent. Considering they run it more fast food style (order at the counter and clean up after yourselves), it's economical."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Ajax hands down. Their service is top notch and their food is always cooked to perfection and fresh no matter what dish you choose. Seems to be family owned so it's the type of place where they care about every single customer experience and interaction."}
{"text":"Wow. Really impressed. After driving by this place 100's of times we decided to give it a go. It came highly recommend by a friend. We had the Tandoori chicken wrap, eggplant, and samosas. All the food was delicious, fresh and hot. Service was very friendly and most dishes, because they are hand made take about 15 min. So call in your order or sit down for a causal meal. The food is Afghan in origin and like nothing I've ever tasted. It's somewhere between middle eastern and Indian. We are really looking forward to our next meal there."}
{"text":"Loved every bite of this! Had the mixed kebab dinner with rice and salad. The sauces that come withiit are so good!   Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"The best Afghan restaurant I ever been in Ajax! I recommend the chicken kabab amazing! Also the beef burger is amazing with their amazing sauces! Hot hot hot! Amazing food  Really like the place friendly servers and very calm and cozy! Amazing Borani and mixed grilled kabab! Garlic naan is the best!  Comes back every now and then!!"}
{"text":"The best chicken tandoori wrap ever. I wish they had a location in Brampton. Ended up packing more stuff to go. I need to come back here soon."}
{"text":"The BEST chicken tandoori and kebab meals. The staff is super friendly and delivers the best customer service. The mantoo is also delicious and would highly recommend it as an appetizer. The yogurt sauce that they provide is phenomenal along with their freshly made naan. I can no longer go to any other kebab place, nothing comes close to the savoury dishes and superb customer service that Maimana provides."}
{"text":"Really good food. Was very authentic and very tasty. Prices are very reasonable and the staff is super nice."}
{"text":"So I've been hearing about this place for a while and have been looking for a great middle eastern place in the Durham region.   Needless to say I found it!!  Great service, comfortable seating and the food was delicious full of flavour and aroma.   The chicken and beef was cooked just right tender and juicy.  Definitely coming back with a few more people"}
{"text":"I had a very good experience here. The decor is very simple, and there are no waiters or table side service, but the food is very good. We ordered 3 different kebab meals, and the eggplant meal. This was my parents first experience with Afghan food, and they plan on coming back.  I had the mixed grill kebab which came 3 kinds of meat, all we very moist and flavorful.  The vegan at the table enjoyed the eggplant meal, but wished the eggplant portion was larger."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken tandoori kebab. It was delicious! The sauces on the table were really good. The red sauce is spicy and the green sauce is more flavorful (cilantro) with a bit of heat but not much. All in all a great place to have in Ajax."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. The food is amazing. Its definitely my favourite place to go and eat in ajax. But most of all, the cooks are really nice and humble.  I recommend this restaurant to everybody."}
{"text":"Wow that was good.  Tandoori chicken wrap is a little spicy for my taste but is so good I don't care.  Friendly, good value fast, highly tasty.  So good..."}
{"text":"Me and a group of friends went here after a hike and I was blown away by the food. I got the mixed grill entire which consisted of 3 skewers (chicken, beef, and shish kebab). My fav was hands down the chicken one. It was tender and juicy with tons of flavours. The shish kebab was very flavourful but too salty for my liking. The beef skewer was good and cooked really well, but nothing that blew me away.   It came with a generous serving of rice and a naan. The naan was good, not like your typical greasy one but still chewy and soft on the inside. I can't wait to try the garlic naan next time! Overall the price is just a little pricier than the average, at $16 or $17 for my plate, but the quality is considerably better than your average place. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Tandoori chicken is one of the best I have ever tried. I have ordered from this place many times and I have always received quality food."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Whenever we are in the area, we always stop by. The tandoori chicken wrap is to die for!!! I hear lots of other stuff are good there, but since we don't live close by, we stick to what we know is good. It is not necessarily fast food (as in the service) but the food is made with love and it shows!"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to try it after avoiding it since it opened due to them not serving the famous afghan Qabuli rice (I just feel always ended up going somewhere where the rice is served instead)   The place looks great, and the food looks nice too but I found it fell short on flavour and comparing it to other Afghan places it did not meet the same standard.  I think they're trying too hard to appeal to western people.  Also they use black sesame seeds on the bread instead of the traditional nigella seeds which I find rather sad.   It's rather pricey too, if I may add."}
{"text":"Got a chicken Schworm a wrap smelled horrible looked horrible had like no chicken Did not ask me what condiments I want on the swarm decided to put onions whatever he felt was needed. Go somewhere else or very wise as to what u pick."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been ordering food from here for the past year and a half. It is like a Bamiyan Kabob (if you've ever been to one) but imho better.  We usually order food for pick up if we don't have time to cook dinner or just get the craving. Typical orders for us are the mixed grill kabab (tikka, chicken and shish kabab) about $16 and sultani kabab (same thing minus the chicken kabab) about $14. The meat is very flavorful and the meals are served with rice, salad and fresh naan. They will always ask you how you like your tikka kabab and I always get mine medium.  Staff are very friendly and the restaurant is bright and clean. It is in a plaza off Kingston road, so if you're in the Ajax area and you're feeling really hungry, a kabab meal will surely satisfy."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars. It is pricey for the portion size you get. I've had the chicken tandoori meal and the chicken and rice is perfection. You should try their naan as it is pretty delicious. My only downside is that they do not serve vegetables with their meals unless you get a salad. It's one of the better spots in Durham though so a good option."}
{"text":"Don't discount this unassuming restaurant because it's sandwiched between a nail salon and a Subway. To be honest, I probably wouldn't have given it a second thought myself, had it not come highly recommended by a fellow Yelper.  I don't live in Ajax so it's unlikely for me to notice new and exciting restaurants to try but after receiving the recommendation, I added it to my 'to do' list and finally found myself here last night for dinner.  The restaurant seats nearly 30 people and although I reckon they have a large 'take-out' customer base, it was really nice to be able to just sit and enjoy our dinner. We settled on Shish Kabab and Chicken Tandoori Kabab but were also fortunate enough to try the Mantoo.  If you haven't tried Mantoo before, which I hadn't myself, I highly recommend giving it a go. In layman's terms it's dumplings filled with ground beef and onions served with the most delicious seasoned yogurt. It was light but satisfying and I'm sure I would be happy to just dine on that alone for dinner. The yogurt it was served with was incredible and, with manners simply forgotten, I used my naan to soak the rest of it up! Not a drop was to be wasted.  Each of the Kabab dishes were served with rice, a small dish of yogurt, salad and naan. The meat was so tender and cooked to perfection! Everything about our dishes was fantastic... from the salad to the naan.  There's something special about Afghan rice that I have never been able to replicate at home so when the owner came to check on us I engaged him in conversation with hope that he might reveal his secrets.  Halfway through the rice cooking instructions I suspected I was being led on a wild goose chase to which the moral of the story would end up being, it's just easier to come here for dinner where the works already been done!  I tend to agree.  When we had finished our meal I was left with an odd feeling that I just couldn't put my finger on... and then it hit me. I truly felt as though I should be in a larger restaurant, one where I would've had to have made reservations. The presentation and taste of the food was unlike any other 'fast food' joint.  They certainly take pride in what they do and they value their customers. Make no mistake, it shows."}
{"text":"Good food for a good price. They should keep the food a little bit warmer though. My food was lukewarm when I sat down to eat and cold by the time I finished it."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Delicious find in Ajax. Kababs are cooked to perfection juicy, flavorful, and spiced very well. A fast food restaurant with  big time food."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The owner is very nice and takes a lot of pride in his kitchen and his food. Had the shish kabab and the chicken dinner. AmaZing. If you eat here make sure you get the green and the white sauce."}
{"text":"My dad actually found this restaurant (they do takeout) by fluke.  When he brought the food back...it was delicious!  I love Afghani rice...so flavourful!  I have gone back to the restaurant because it was yummy.  Both times I had the chicken kabobs (about 5 decent size chunks of chicken) rice and a small side salad, plus chutneys.  I think it was around $11.00 but don't quote me.  The second time I also got the tandoori kabobs...the menu said it is spicy, but I didn't find it spicy, but then again I have a higher tolerance for spice.  The restaurant is small and there are no big frills, but it is clean and decent.  They do takeout as well, which takes a bit of time if you order right there - which to me means they are not pre-packaging the food in back - cooked fresh!  The owner and staff are friendly and I am excited to go back and try some more items!  I can't comment on the authentic nature of the cuisine since I am not Afghani, but regardless it's pretty great!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this little place and almost passed it by. It doesn't seem like much of a place, kind of a fast food set-up but being Afghan cuisine I'm always up for something new.  Upon entering I found that this is a proper restaurant with a nice variety of dishes. I would suggest the Mantoo (dumplings) as an appetizer. Of all the selections I tried the Sultnai kabob which was very tasty & distinctly unique flavour. I will definitely try the mixed grill next time. Only caution is the the House Doogh soft drink is made of yogurt & mint which is an acquired taste so just order a glass instead of a whole pitcher. You can tell how good a restaurant is by the amount of orders and while eating here I counted at least 10 (maybe more) people walking in for take out orders."}
{"text":"Sheekh kabab combos and wraps were great. Owners are friendly. Food was fresh (in contrast to the first reviewer who complained about stale rice). May not necessarily be on par with Bamiyan Kabab, but it is close. Hope they can expand their menu options. Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Honestly this is my go to place in Ajax.  Even though I live at the other end of Ajax, I always take friends here or at least to get takeout.  I've had almost everything on the menu.  The two brothers are great hosts as well.  Great prices, although lunch time the combos are on sale by a dollar and you get a free drink!  Let me tell you about the owners,  they're aiming to please.  My mom politely asked how their sambosa tasted and he gave her one to taste and when i tried to pay for it, he said it was a gift for her.    I've been here about a dozen times and it's awesome.  Not a restaurant really,  more like a take out joint with good seating for tables of 4.  lots of seating.  They aren't trying to be a fancy place but it's nice and clean!  And man I was surprised they were open on Christmas!    For about $10  you get a lot of rice, your kabab, a salad with tomatoes and cucumber, and a naan bread.  lunch time you get a free drink!  come on!  Mall prices with restaurant quality and service.  Clean washrooms and a great experience.  No tip jar, so that's why I'm making this my first post ever!  I do wish they would put in a TV though.   but now I'm being picky!"}
{"text":"I found Maimana (named after a city in Northern Afghanistan) by complete accident, actually. After a hilarious conversation with my wife about having ice cream for dinner at Marble Slab Creamery, which is in the same place. I saw the name, and I though, I should go and check this place's menu out at least. And that turned into trying it out. Ironically, the hook was Boolanee and Mantoo - which Wais, the proprietor, regrettably explained were sold out because a caterer had come and bought his entire stock for the day!  The main menu offerings are a variety of kebabs, which come in a meal with rice and a very nice green salad, and of course naan (bread). Now, almost every review of an Afghan restaurant I've seen comes with complaints about the bread because the name makes people think of (wonderful) Indian naan. Afghan bread is not the same, it's drier and tougher but it's useful as a utensil and is usually supplied with sauces that it is dipped in. It's delicious, but it isn't Indian naan.  My wife had their tandoori kebab, I had sultani kebab (which was a combo of a couple of options). The food was tasty, the meat well spiced and not greasy, and the bread a nice accompaniment, and refreshingly, not a massive piece of naan that either gets wasted or makes you eat too much.  We finished (with Wais' humourous insistence and a money-back guarantee) with firnee, a traditional Afghan dessert that's a little like panna cotta, flavoured with cardamon, rosewater, and pistachio. It's simple and delicious and a perfect end to a spicy meal. Had we nowhere else to go that night, I imagine I'd have sat for a whole lot of chai as well.  I do hope as they gain footing the menu will expand to offer some more Afghan options besides kebab - qorma, qabili palaw, and sabzi would be awesome."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the tandoori chicken wrap.  Very flavorful and fresh!  Simple and clean restaurant with friendly staff.  I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"In my continuing quest to explore new (to me) restaurants, I ventured out to Ajax, with no particular destination in mind. I'll just know when I get there. That brought me to Maimana, an Afghan/Middle Eastern restaurant. It's a small place, with seating for around 30ppl, and no table service. Orders are placed and picked up at the counter. Trays and plates are also returned there.  I am no expert on this cuisine but I like most of what I've had so far from other restaurants. It took me a few minutes to decide what to order but I chose the Waziri Tandoori Kabab, which included a skewer each of tandoori chicken and beef shish kabab with rice, salad, and naan for $13.95.  What I got was a plate of very tender and juicy tandoori chicken, moist ground beef kabab, fluffy basmati rice, a simple salad with a delicious house-made dressing, and a freshly made naan. This food was good! It was cooked perfectly and full of flavour!  I'll be back to try more of their menu. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow. So impressed! Four of us stopped in the Plaza to grab a burger elsewhere but decided to walk in to Maimana when we saw \"kebab\". Best move ever!   We had a beef masala burger,  chicken tandoori burger, a chicken breast kabob meal - love the spices and lemon on it -with rice and a tandoori chicken kabob with fries. Yummmm!  We also tried the firnee dessert (milk and cardamom pudding) and it was delicious!   Everything was tasty and fresh! It was also lovely to be greeted by the owner.   Great experience!"}
{"text":"What a welcome addition Maimana is to Ajax, once the land of too many gourmet burger joints!  Hubby found great Yelp reviews on this place and while in the area for a shopping trip last weekend, we decided to drop in for lunch.    If you're here for a quick lunch, think again.  Our lunch order of mixed grills and a tandoori chicken wrap took just as long as it would have taken (15 - 20 min to get the food) had we gone to a regular sit down restaurant.  But I understand that it can take some time to cook up kabobs and that wonderful (not indian) naan bread.  Waiss, the owner, was very friendly and chatted with hubby while our babe and I checked the place out for a high chair and a change table.    It's funny how after becoming parents, our decision on where to dine are made largely based on two things:  Do they have high chairs?  And do they have a change table?  This may not be important for everyone but for parents with little ones still in diapers, it can be a matter of having a relaxing lunch vs shovel it in as quick as possible lunch.  And unfortunately, most fast food joint do not have change tables in their usually large washrooms.  Maimana was no exception and this made the lunch feel more rushed as we knew we would have to stop in at another place just to change her diaper.    Now on to the food.  As the previous reviews mentioned, the kabobs in the mix grill were well seasoned (to the typical Afghan style) and served in juicy yumminess...at least the chicken and the ground beef ones were.  The sirloin, in my humble opinion, could have been marinaded a little longer for tenderness as it was quite toothsome.  The condiments served with the meal were nice compliments to the grilled meat with my preference leaning to the smokier red sauce.  The tandoori chicken wrap was also tasty if not a little too salty for my taste buds.   And I don't know why it happens so often to me but it happened again here....yes.  I didn't get my doogh and I didn't realize it until we left.  I will blame the missing drink on my mommy brain which was trying to have a fast-ish lunch while worrying about where to change a diaper.  But our friendly owner also forgot about it and seeing as we were the only patrons in the place, I guess we were all too preoccupied with something else that day.    I will be back to try out the rest of their menu when I'm in the area and hopefully get my doogh next time."}
{"text":"Love this place , it's a place I recommend too people too try different flavours ! I always get the tandoori chicken wrap with fries , it's so good and fills you up ! They have this nice white yogurt sauce which I really like also ! Can't wait too go back !"}
{"text":"Maimana has very flavourful items on their menu. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming. The only flaw is the cashiers don't ever look like they want to be there. When you place a order a head they don't ask for a name or phone number. Maimana is mostly for quick dine in or take-out. I would suggest to work on their customer service and to expand the dining area. I would also love to for them to expand to do catering."}
{"text":"Amazing Afghan food! One of the best places to eat in Ajax. The service is never to disappoint. The food is always hot, fresh and prepared with passion. Everything made in house. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious meal!  And affordable.    Had the tikka Kabab.  And they through in a eggplant too.  Very nice staff."}
{"text":"Not cool  I went there looking for a quick take out and left with nothing.  Woman was so stressed she couldn't even tell me how long my order would take. She couldn't even smile or say hello. Lost a customer"}
{"text":"A very nice and clean establishment. I visited this place after reading reviews on Yelp and was definitely not disappointed. Food was really fresh, quantity was good and the staff really polite. All dishes we tried were good and the rice is just amazing. I am definitely going back to this place!"}
{"text":"amazing food...great take out and eat in  high quality afghan food"}
{"text":"Sad I may never be in the area again because this exactly what I am looking for in a middle-eastern Afghani meal. Tandoori style chicken the cooked perfectly, tasty naan, not dry rice, and a fresh salad.  Lucky, the people of Ajax are, very lucky."}
{"text":"My meal: Tandoori chicken salad Chicken was moist, tender, favourable. Salad was fresh and crisp and plated beautifully.  Everyone else's meal:  Mixed meat - all the meat was dry Lamb chops - okay flavouring but was not seared and lacked the ummph that searing adds to the dish. Chicken wrap and fries - my mother ate it all.  Rice - I'm use to the full on seasoned rice found in Scarborough restaurants. Naan - this was delicious! Light and had that addictive carb smell of fresh naan!  Service: All the staff were friendly and accommodated our large family. Food came out quickly!  Notes: Place was really smoky, so prepare to smell like food. House made hot sauce is very mild and reminds me of ketchup, but it does level up the meat"}
{"text":"Owners are very friendly! The chicken tandoori with French fries was delicious!  The sauces for the chicken tandoori was very tasty! The Naan was out of this world!  Great first experience and will definitely be returning..."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprising tasty food. Lots of places have kebabs nowadays, so what it thought would be nothing special actually was. The sauces are great as well. Had the chicken (to play it safe), and as I'm always looking for a new taste, I was pleasantly surprised. Have been back several times, and I'm always lured back to my original choice.  Nice to have the selection. The place is moderately busy every time I go, and that's a good sign. Very diverse clientele. Pleasant customer service every time."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place the last couple of years. We finally made it here this year. Am I glad we did!  We ordered Shish kabab with extra crispy fries, Eggplant borani and 2 plain and 1 garlic naan. Hubs loved the eggplant borani. It was baked egglant mixed with fresh tomatoes, red peppers, onion and galic served with yogurt-mint sauce. Daughter and I shared the shish kabab and we loved it. The shish kabab was really soft and the fries were nicely crispy. Naans were nice tasty and hot. Been wanting to try this place because it's always been crowded. If it's crowded, must be good! Service was a little slow because everything was fresh and made to order. It was well worth the wait! Very friendly service. Will definitely return next time we're in area!"}
{"text":"Pretty good quality halal afghani food with kababs, wraps, masala burgers, vegetarian options like eggplant borani.  I usually have a wrap and fries combo which is about $9 and tasty.  Portions are not gigantic which is ok given that the quality is better.  This is not a place like your common shwarma huts where you have the option of adding 10 different items to your platter so the fixings are somewhat limited for the wrap.    That said service is really friendly and you can tell that they care about the customer."}
{"text":"I love Middle eastern food and I love this place! I am a regular here and everyone that I have brought here feels the same way. The chicken breast kabab meal is my fave and their portions are huge. 1 plate can feed 2 people unless you are super hungry which is my case every time ha....The owner(s) are genuinely nice people. My stomach  and tastebuds adore you Mai'mama (insert heart here)"}
{"text":"Swung by again for another great meal. The restaurant was full and the owner remembered my last visit and was very greatful. Love seeing success for good people!"}
{"text":"My day is not complete if I don't at least go to a restaurant for some fine dining! I liked the feel of the atmosphere inside. The presentation of the d ishes they served here were truly enticing and delectable. The staff here were all helpful and friendly. My experience was truly a wonderful one. I am glad I decided to check this place out."}
{"text":"One of the best Persian restaurants I ever been to. Excellent service and delicious food with amazing sauces."}
{"text":"Compared to other similar restaurants this place is expensive. The food was good but I was not impressed with the quantity. The beef Kababs were exceptional and the nan was fantastic. The service was normal. The sitting was tight and the music didn't need to be that loud ."}
{"text":"Best Afghani food in Ajax. The meat is always tender and full of flavor. The staff are delightful and friendly. Rice is amazing! I have ordered several items off the menu and not one disappointed!"}
{"text":"As an Afghan and Toronto native who thought Bamyan Kebab was the best in the city, Maimana has taken the title.  Great service, nice and cozy restaurant and most importantly the food is AMAZING.  It tastes good and makes you feel like you're eating at home.  Lots of menu items to try and definitely somewhere to take your visiting guests, parents or non-Afghani buddies.  They also have meals for vegetarians!"}
