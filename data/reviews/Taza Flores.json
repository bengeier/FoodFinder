{"text":"I've been there a few times and it never disappoints. The service is great, the waiters know the menu and what to recommend in line with your likes. The food is always tasty and great for sharing and discovering. The quality/price is fair. I would definitely recommend this place for a nice date or catching up with friends and family."}
{"text":"So I made a reservation on YELP. When we arrived we were told they don't accept reservations. Having received a confirmation didn't convince, whom I believe was the owner, that indeed they appear to do so. Neither did the fact a few tables had \"reserved\" signs on them. Other than the reserved-sign tables, I was invited to wait until a table became available. Needless to say I didn't.  Instead we went to Le Margaux down the street, and had a wonderful dinner there. I won't be returning to Taza Flores any time soon. My suggestion is  you don't go there either. There are enough good restaurants in Montreal who appreciate their customers business and deserve our patronage.  Apparently Taza is not one of these."}
{"text":"I went to this place five times in the last month and really like it - the atmosphere is great and so is the food. My favorite tapas are the dates and the figs - definitely a recommendation! If you´re not too full after the tapas, the Mousse au Chocolat is great!  The service was also excellent and the decor really fits the place - a must-try place!"}
{"text":"Première fois et sûrement pas la dernière. Les tapas délicieux,  service excellent et l'ambiance chaleureuse !  Wow je le recommande"}
{"text":"I love Taza Flores! The place looks good and the terrace is very pleasant in the summer. The service is very friendly and attentive. And everything on the menu is really really good. I've been going for years and it never fails. My favorite are the lamb tajine, the chorizo, the eggplant pizza and the mergez in tomato sauce. It is a bit expensive for the size of the portions, but they put love into it."}
{"text":"One of the best tapas restos in Montreal. Highly recommended to those who like to share."}
{"text":"Delicioso todo y los cócteles , el pulpo, hay unos platos q contienen varias entradas , en general un lugar para arrancar la noche con buena música y cócteles. El servicio muy bueno ."}
{"text":"I love this tapas place. The portions are generous and the price is reasonable! I always enjoy eating there. Most of the time the servers are really nice, but there is a lady that works there that is really rude. She seats us sometimes but she never shares a smile or answer really sharply to my questions. I'm not sure she still works there but I hope this would not stop anyone from coming back since the food is really amazing. My favourites are the hummus, the guacamole, the mozzarella tomatoes, the lamb tajine, the shrimps and so many more..."}
{"text":"Stopped in this.cozy and quaint spot for a light dinner.  I had the eggplant pizza with pesto and goat cheese along with the tomato and goat cheese in balsamic vinegar.  I enjoyed both small plates very much.  I also ordered a simple cosmopolitan, but it tasted so good!  My friend ordered a couple of small plates, but she was upset bout them being out of both calamari and polenta.  Overall, it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this restaurant as part of our week of Mtl a table.   This adorable restaurant in the upper parts of Du Parc street is cozy and welcoming. That was a wonderful start!  The night only got better with the food. Very Mediterranean, these tapas were the perfect size, very reasonably priced and delicious. The mango salad was a winner with very differing tastes of fruit, cheese and greens mixing exquisitely. The tajine d'agneau, the tilapia ceviche, the calamari and more. We were three and ordered 3 tapas each. This way we shared more and experienced a wider variety of tastes. That was one of the keys to this night being great-every dish was strong yet delicate.   This was an amazing restaurant and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I discovered this little gem during a group dinner. From the Tartare to the Artichoke dish, stuffed dates wrapped in bacon ....each was a delectable taste discovery! Our Server suggested an excellent wine (which name escapes me): a very rich, velvety red that complimented the food selection perfectly. Decor is warm with a nice relaxed and contented vibe. I definitély want to come back with my husband so he discovers this great place. The service was also genuinely warm and professional. I hope you try this place and have as great an experience as we did!"}
{"text":"Pretty good tapas! A bit on the expensive side (on my standards), this is the kind of place that is fun to hang out at and have a few bites, but you don't want to show up very hungry, or you'll burn a small hole in your pocket. Dishes are well executed (all four that I tried), but they are small: - The FIGUES FRAICHES AUX PROSCIUTTO ET VIEUX CHEDDAR is just four small bites (but yammi!). - SALADE DE MANGUES, TOMATE CERISE, FIGUE, NOIX DE PIN & HALLOUM GRILLÉ, CHIMICHURRI  is very good. - CHORIZO GRILLÉ, BALSAMIQUE RÉDUIT ET SAUCE PIRI PIRI MAISON is just a few slices of the chorizo but very well executed, and probably one of the more filling tapas they serve. - BOUCHEES DE POLENTA AU PARMESAN is a fried polenta, and very well executed.  Service is pretty good. I might be back."}
{"text":"I have said it before and will say it again but places where the music is too loud for you to have a nice conversation with your company without having to shout and break your voice are annoying. And places where they try to cramp as many people on the smallest surface as well. What are you trying to do? Break the world record for Most people in a meter square?! So, sure the food was good with a slight original hint but if this atmosphere screams at me to get out of there, that's what I will do and make sure I never go back. Expect to rake your wallet as well as it is a bit on the expensive side (I suppose you pay for the electricity consumed to blast the music so loud!) and you should definitely go grab drinks somewhere else afterwards or you'll just go poor."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this Spanish Tapas restaurant located in the mile end area and loved all their dishes! Looking into the resto , one can't help notice the cozy warm ambiance that awaits you once you enter the resto. Service was super warm and friendly which added to the overall great experience! It is a great place for a night out with friends and recommend sharing dishes in order to try as many of their wonderful tapas dishes as possible. Also great place to take a date ! Now for the food...simply delicious and packed with explosive flavors. I loved their grilled halloum(cheese) salad appetizers and their eggplant pizza..both were well seasoned and had fresh ingredients! Don't forget to try their paella and mushroom feuillette dishes ..both were supper yummy!  A meal here is definately not complete without trying out their mouth-watering orange flavored creme brulee!  Definately recommend this resto and will go back! Reservations are recommended ."}
{"text":"Stopped in alone at 4:30 to an empty place; my favorite. The waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I had the endive salad and the grilled octopus. It was unforgettable. I wish I had room for more food! Great happy hour wine and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Finally a true, comfy, fine place to go. Evening lights are precious on the wooden terrasse.  Wines (rosé Touraine 2015 and the red Lopez de Hajo Rioja 2015) are carefully chosen, products are fresh and professionally -- if not always originally -- seasoned. On my Montreal to-do list!"}
{"text":"I came here for Taste MTL and was not disappointed. $19 for three Tapas is a great deal, especially when you consider the quality of the food and the comfortable atmosphere. This restaurant looks like a really hip mile-end apartment that's been converted into a commercial space. The decoration is tasteful -- think vintage posters on the walls, exposed brick, coffered tin ceiling, and my favourite, dry branches with white lights hanging over the bar-- without being overdone. It's romantic and intimate but also seems like it would lend itself well to a small meeting among close friends.   It was a little strange when we walked in. We had a reservation, but were seated at a table in the back next to the bathrooms. When I asked our host if we might be able to get one of the tables near the front window, he pointed to the signs that said \"Reservée\" and told me they were reserved. I was more than a little confused since we had a reservation but were not seated at a table with a reservée sign. Either this place has super-reservations, or there were some famous people dining there that night who I was not familiar with.   All that being said, our waitress was incredibly sweet throughout the whole evening. When discussing which wine we should order by the glass, offered to let us taste the two we were deciding between. The cocktail menu and the wine list are nothing to write home about, but they're well priced and the wine list includes a few interesting discoveries.   Now for the food. I began with the ceviche: tilapia with lime juice, coconut milk, coriander and ginger. For tapas the portion size was quite generous and it was lovely and refreshing dish. The cutting acidity of the lime was well balanced by the coconut milk and the coriander lent it a nice herbacity. My fiancee had the beef carpaccio which was quite good. No strange twists like you get in far too many restaurants trying to re-invent the wheel these days, just razor-thin beef slices, peppery-fresh arugula and parmesan shavings.   Course number two involved the Cod Fritters for me and the Goat cheese croutons with grilled vegetables for my fiancee. Like the Carpaccio, the Cod Fritters were simple: just three traditional little fishcakes filled with delicious flaky Cod. The spicing was interesting, a little peppery and possibly some Old Bay which was  nicely balanced by the tartar sauce. My fiancee's dish a little bit of a letdown, some slices of baguette with semi-firm (brie-like) goat cheese melted on little pieces of grilled vegetables. It was fine, but  less exciting than she expected.   Our final course included the Chorizo with a balsamic reduction  and the artichoke stuffed with ham, bacon and mushrooms.  To be honest, I found the Chorizo a little too spicy and was disappointed to find out that they did not make the sausage themselves. The stuffed artichoke was good, but the bacon/ham/mushroom combo was in a very rich cream sauce which made the dish just a little too heavy.   All this being said, I would absolutely come back to Taza Flores without hesitation. It's a great place to grab a drink or two with some friends and to have some great snacks. I might not come back specifically for dinner, but then again, Tapas and Dinner are two very different meals.  Taza Flores excels at Tapas and is a lovely place to hang out."}
{"text":"Having lived in this area of the Mile End for a little over a year, I can attest to the fact that Taza Flores is a gem that is frequented by mostly locals (especially by those who are attempting to be a bit frugal without sacrificing food quality). This spot also doesn't succumb to same aura of hipster-pretentiousness that plagues other restaurants/bars of the Mile End.  Last night, I went with a few people and shared four tapas, including Eggplant Pizza; Cod Fritters; Grilled Chorizo; and the Vegetable Platter. All of these options were fantastic, flavourful, and made with delicate care by the chef in the bar area. Having initially expressed some skepticism around the cod fritters, this particular tapas ironically blew me away. It was fried as the name implies, and served with a rich and creamy tartar sauce.  While the service was exceptionally good, I'd suggest in the future that they explain the options more in-depth without being prompted by the restaurant guests (ie. explain each aspect of the vegetable platter tapas).   Fun tip: Go after 11pm and order three tapas for ~$23."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly and helpful service, and great ambience! The cold tapas were my favourite, there were some especially delicious salads: the poached pear with Gorgonzola and the goat cheese with raspberry ones were divine! Also loved the fresh figs with prosciutto, cheddar, and balsamic glaze--packed such a punch of flavour in one small bite. This was such a great find in the Mile End area, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. It has an eclectic menu, but each of the 6 dishes we tried was great. To have not a single miss is impressive. Highly recommended are the Tagine with lamb, the walnut salad, the mango salad, the tarte tatin, lamb cigars, and the eggplant pizza.   Service was excellent. Catherine was fantastic. This is a must-try place."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times now, since I just moved in next door. The wait staff is very friendly and all the tapas dishes that I ordered were delish! Not to mention a decent selection of drinks. The actual space itself, both the inside and the outdoor terrasse are also very inviting and charming. It's just quite expensive. So be prepared to pay up! Haha."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with my experience there for the mtl a table. The carpaccio was so salty, the ceviche was disgusting, the tortilla was a disgusting quich filled with potatoes, the tartare was not eatable and the artichaut looked like wet dog food. I don't recommend this place to anyone. The only up side was the service, the decor and the wine."}
{"text":"Service,food, and cocktails were excellent! You must try the hallumi cheese salad, grilled octopus, beef tartar, calamari, grilled chorizo,and duck confit fries. Drinks are strong and tasty-peach martini and mojito. Service was friendly, prompt, attentive and gave good suggestions for discos. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Charming and comfortable with delicious food, good drinks, and very friendly service. Would be a great place to take a date, hang out with friends, or grab a quick drink and bite after work. Has a nice and cozy coffee shop vibe. One of my favorites of the places I went in the Mile End while visiting."}
{"text":"We had such a great dinner here tonight! The manager was great and offered up great conversation for us out of towners. The menu is cold & hot tapas. It is a creative menu and everything we had was soooo gooood! The atmosphere is very cosy and inviting. And there is 1 tv so i could keep an eye on the hockey game!"}
{"text":"I am a complete fan of this place. The only downside is that it is a little bit pricy to go there very often but other than I am amazed.  The food is completely amazing (N.B. Only tapas place), the staff is really good (especially the boss who is very nice). I mean they are nice, respectful and you can see that they do care about their customers. This place is an hidden gem and I am very happy that I found that."}
{"text":"This is my favorite tapas place to eat at!!! Love love love their dishes. I love the bacon covered dates, ceviche. Honestly, everything on the menu is great. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Our waiter was fabulous. He made us feel comfortable. The food was excellent. Every dish was well presented. And when it was served the presentation was superb, and the dishes were more delectable than described.  This was our best experience in dining in Montreal not only this trip, but the best of all our visits to the city in 30+ years."}
{"text":"It feels so bad that this place wasn't event in the system base. Anyway, that being said, I've added this place. It's a Tapas bar and it's the first Tapas Bar I actually go. The concept is Spanish. In Spain everybody goes out EVERY night. Tapas is a great way of getting something to eat and drink some red spanish wine at the bar with friends. In North america, most concept is more like a restaurant and will have more sitting places with a trendy-young crowd. I had a lot to eat there actually and some drink there and there. Great selection of Drink and beer. The service seems a little bit confusing but looks like it was working pretty well. Different waiter/waitresses during the meal but friendly and efficient.   I had  Beef Carpaccio = super great, with a small cresson salad and old grinded chedar, the texture+ taste was awesome. Anneth Smoked Salmon = a classic but the quality was really the top. Extremly fresh Grilled Octopus on a lens salad: WOW! Now the salad is extremly great with crouton or bread and the Octopus, never ate some octopus as good as this. It's so great that if you go there, build over the predjudice you might have against octopus because it's tender, the meat is tasty and smoke-ish (because it's grilled).  Bacon dates with chiorizo and nuts: with a balsamic / rasberry reduction: Ok now that's so great that as soon as I had one in my mouth, I had already pick up the other one to eat it right away. It's pretty sweet but the spicy taste of chiorizo is great.  Grilled Chorizo with balsam reduction: Ok it's sums it all: hmm Seafood Casserole gratin with a nice cheese sauce; It doesn't overpower the seafood taste and it's really great quality.  Lamb and Olive Tajine  with lemon and ginger confit: that's great, with fresh coriander, nice small potato.   Really nice to share with friend a plate. The more the Merrier is definetely something that apply to that kind of restaurant!"}
{"text":"J'ai célébré mon anniversaire à ce resto en 2014 avec mes amis et tout le monde a adoré sa soirée! Les cocktails étaient bons, les tapas étaient savoureux, l'ambiance est très agréable et le décor est très chaleureux! J'y retourne c'est certain!"}
{"text":"I went a couple months ago.  All I remember is the steak tartare, which was very grey.  I asked the waiter since I'm more used to tartare being bright red.  He said that they let it cure in lime juice because they're doing something \"different than everyone else\".  That's fine.  I personally did not think it looked appetizing or tasted good.  I don't remember the rest of the food, but it wasn't great or terrible."}
{"text":"A little loud, but great food and great, speedy service. Good wine list, and the ambiance was cool. The octopus was . A bit pricy, and if you've had tapas beforehand, you know the portions are made for small sharing."}
