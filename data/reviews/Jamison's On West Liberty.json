{"text":"I can't believe my eyes: someone is actually complaining about a FREE wing night. Free. Gratis. Gratuit. Frei. ??.

I came by last night for the first time to try out their wing night. First off, I've lived in other states and I've never heard of a free wing night. Who are these earth angels giving out free wings to us undeserving commoners? Secondly, these wings were HUGE and super delicious. Thirdly, the staff is so nice and they're, for some strange reason, working hard to feed the masses with free food. Sure, there might be a bit of a wait, but this night is really popular, so have some damn sympathy (Do you know who I am?! I'm a yelper! Cue South Park episode). Fourthly, the place is pretty cool. It's relaxed, there are games and it just has cool vibes. There are signs along the wall advertising even more deals that they have - Can we just call the pope to have him bless this place as a holy site already? Lastly, I think all of the planets aligned last night because not only was it free wing night, it was Mardi Gras. I was just floating away in wing heaven when the server told me that beers on tap were free for women for an hour. I had to hold my head to keep it from exploding. ??! 

Great beer, delicious wings, great staff, cool patrons - what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"You may not expect it by its looks, but the food here is awesome!! The thick, knife-and-fork bacon they serve is flavorful and delicious. The most recent time I went I tried the goat cheese pesto dip with pita chips. I don't know why I had low expectations but man I was surprised! The dip was soooo tasty and the \"chips\" were moist but also lightly crispy, cooked perfectly. I would go back just for the food lol it's way above typical bar food.

I've been here many times and the service is typically very good. The regular girls that work here are great. There's been a few outlier scenarios where there's been different servers, but still I've never had any major issues."}
{"text":"The bacon Mac and cheese is ridiculous.  The bartenders are always attentive and they have a great beer selection."}
{"text":"This is a great little bar with reasonable drink prices and amazing food! I seriously would go back just for the food. They played great music and the bartenders and atmosphere was on point!"}
{"text":"I'm reviewing on the fact that I only go to Jamison's on Saturday nights, with my friends because we love the late 90's/early 2000's music DJ.. and the bartenders are good, and drinks are strong.. Everything you want in a neighborhood bar! Haven't had any food, but I hear pretty good things."}
{"text":"Bacon stix, seriously, get them.  Went because we were starving and didn't want to drive anywhere so we popped in for a late dinner. Bartender (owner maybe?) was welcoming and friendly, even to us non regulars (there seemed to be a lot of regulars there).  Nice and dark in there and they had a great beer selection - they didn't have Guinness but the bartender recommended yards and it was even better.  Before you do anything else get the bacon stix - sounds weird but I was in bacon heaven. Thick and just crispy enough and fatty too in the best possible way.  Wings were nice and crispy kinda wanted a little more salt on them but the bacon made up for it. I was too full for my dinner of the chicken carbonara but I had a couple of bites - so killer so i packed the rest to go.  Hubby got the pierogi dinner - wouldn't get that again but everything else - delicious.  Heard their burgers were good and the bartender said all their food was homemade - will go back and try more stuff."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is amazing and good priced. Their specials are awesome. I love the atmosphere. There is no smoking in this bar, which is great. I have nothing bad or mediocre to say about this place. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"My go-to bar in the burgh. Great beer selection. Oh, and the food... The food... Is Amazing. I eat here at least once a week. Their wings are unmatchable! Gotta try the bacon stix too!  their steak is one of the best cuts of steak I've had a pleasure of eating.  All around top notch..Not a substandard item on their menu. This place will hopefully cater my wedding. Great staff, all are attentive to your needs. Also, This is a NON SMOKING BAR... Just a heads up! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Best bacon in the city!!!! You have to try the stout and straws burger or the steak burger, both are incredible!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times to meet up with friends for drinks. 16 taps of decent craft beers at moderate prices, good service and pleasant crowd. St Pat's Party this year brought me in originally and the great experience each time brings me back. I went this past Tuesday for Free Wing night and saw a different side of Jamison's. It wasn't overly busy, which for free wings surprised me, and seemed very laid back. I met up with a friend there and after a few tweets more showed up. This is the the kind of place I can go to kick back and watch a game and chill and then come back on the weekend and turn it up a notch. 

Now for the food. Most bars on free wing night tend to downgrade the quality of wings or don't put much effort into it. Not here. Hearty wings and cooked perfect. The deal is you get 5 free wings for your first drink, 5 free for your second drink, and then $.35 each after that. You can easily come out spending less than $20 and I wasn't buying macro beers either. Come with friends and you can have all of the flavors. I had Chipotle BBQ which was sweet and backed more heat than their hottest wing, Garlic Parm which was well balanced on the garlic and parm, Buffalo Ranch could have used a little more sauce but I like my ranch wings sloppy.

Overall this is a gem in Dormont you seriously need to consider and I can't thank my friend enough for turning me on to them. they get 5 stars not for one thing but bringing enjoyment at everything. I've also seen the intense bacon menu they bring and one table ordered burgers that looked immense.  I'm ready to go back now!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  I first stopped by for their Tuesday wing night, and was blown away by the wings.  I spent 4 years in Buffalo, NY and I've been to plenty of wing nights and wing places, and I have to say Jamison's takes the cake.  Between the size and sauces (either wet or a dry rub..can't go wrong) they're the best.

Then the burger.  I only got a very basic burger on their burger night (seriously...the specials here are insane) but you can tell  the burger is handmade.  Came out super juicy and the buffalo cheese was good and spicy.  

I'm willing to bet anything else you get on the menu will be great.  I've snacked on a few other of their offerings including the pizza and the crab cakes....again, nothing has been a miss.  

If you go on a 'bad' night for them, I imagine you'll still walk out with quality food that you won't be mad about.  Not sure if they're capable of a bad night though."}
{"text":"Best bartenders and chef you'll find in a bar in Dormont and the South Hills in general."}
{"text":"Jamison's is everything that you would hope for in a great local bar! Ownership and Staff are excellent. Really good beer selection and food. Has all of the best qualities of a 'Dive' bar and none of the negatives. I highly recommend it to anyone that just wants to have a good time."}
{"text":"We had the basi burgers. They were \"finding money in an old coat, last slice of pie, getting all the green lights\" good .  It's a smaller bar, but the quality of food and service is excellent. The owner is a foodie, but not  pretentious, very nice and welcoming . We intend to bring many friends here."}
{"text":"I must have been here on an \"off\" night given the reviews.  Went with a friend for free wing night and left pretty underwhelmed.

The (very young) bartender let our beers go empty multiple times without asking for a refill.  Poor attitude in general from the bartender.  The wings were good enough but lacked sauce most of the time.  My friend went for a third order of wings at 7:45 and was told he would be charged for them.  Oddly enough, the bartenders friends who sat next to us wasn't charged.  I was relieved when the shift changed as I was hoping her replacement would be better but he was no better.  He looked like he just got off a three-day drug binge.  

I won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional! I loved the burger loved the Pirogies, the deep-fried pickles I can't say enough about. Went to Jamison's with my daughter for a quick burger, So glad I did, the owner was wonderful, she was friendly and attentive and served me one of the best burgers I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and ordered takeout. I ordered the garlic Parm wings and bacon stix for take out. I didn't have a menu but knew the wings had a great reputation. So I figured garlic Parm would be safe to try. They were meaty and very crispy which is how I like them so that made me happy. They were a little light on garlic but I'm a huge garlic lover so that's not a deal breaker. The bacon stix were heavenly. I'll definitely order again and hope to try their burgers too."}
{"text":"I've had many burgers in my 34 years on this earth and Jamison's burger is at the very top of that list.  Unlike most places, they use fresh meat, not frozen.  They also don't rely on toppings to give their burgers flavor, instead they season and grill them to perfection. You would be happy with a lone patty and many places can't say that.  I would suggest one of their specialty burgers with their thick cut bacon. 

I also highly recommend the sriracha dry rub wings."}
{"text":"Get bacon with whatever you order here. They have some high end, fresh made bacon that is next level. Wings, burgers, sandwiches, pretty much everything is good. A huge step above regular bar food!"}
{"text":"My SO and I come here often for the Tuesday wing night. Cant do better than 5 free wings with a beer. My boyfriend swears that these are the best wings he's ever had. His favorites are Sweet Heat and Siracha Ranch. My go to is Honey BBQ. We've also tried the Buffalo Chicken Dip and Pesto Goat Cheese dip, both very good. I haven't tried anything else on their menu yet, but it all looks good.

We always have the same two waitresses who are always busy, but prompt with their service. In the past year that we've been coming here, we have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Dirty, no flavor.  41/2 stars?  Ya gotta be kiddin me!  Im believe that restaurants pay to be pushed up on the list here at yelp!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here more than I can count and I've never had a single thing that wasn't excellent!!!  Good beer selection, old school mugs and a darn good drink. Specials are unreal EVERY day of the week and the staff is absolutely amazing!!!  Go for the food and stay because you'll be treated like family!"}
{"text":"One of the best hamburgers I've ever had.. Try this place and you will not be disappointed. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"\"...good times\" may be Jamison's slogan, but they're also about good, good food, and as a non-drinker, unless a bar has food, I ain't interested. 

Jamison's has been around too long for me to remember when they came about yet I didn't know that dinner could be had here despite zipping past it a thousand times over the years, often forgetting it existed. Last night, after a quirk in our schedules caused us to meet unexpectedly on the way home, Kay and I decided to give this low-key bar & grill a shot.

Jamison's describes their signature Bacon Stix as \"life changing,\" and while I might not concur completely, they were amply tasty. Drizzled with an inky balsamic glaze, each \"stick\" (2 to an order) is merely a prodigiously thick cut of fatty, salty bacon that makes ye want to lift pints after eatin' 'em. Bacon Stix can be had on pizza, burgers, and assorted sandwiches, and man, does Jamison's worship bacon. 

Dumbbells, our second appetizer, are morsels of chicken breast wrapped in bacon (what else?) and skewered with a toothpick to make them look like weight-room equipment. The lard and salt of the bacon were successfully imparted into each chunk of poultry, which we dipped into a cupful of ranch dressing for maximum enjoyment. 

As hip-hop, classic rock, pop, and honky-tonk tunes wafted through the gloomy, sedate environs, I challenged Steak Mountain. A 12 ounce New York Strip steak (I always have my steaks and burgers cooked medium-rare) atop a pile of beer-battered fries, mozzarella, and gravy, Steak Mountain is a test of wills. 

The Canadians call it \"poutine\" and use cheese curds. Us yanks use mozzarella with that gravy and those spuds and call them \"disco fries.\"  Regardless, this was a diner-worthy dinner, the gravy savory, the fries crisp, the cheese oozing and stretching, that slab of succulent, charred beef with rose-colored insides bleeding like Abdullah The Butcher. 

Also munched on prior to the main event was a Wedge Salad featuring bacon bits (again with the bacon!), diced tomatoes, blue cheese, a vinaigrette, and the rest of that ranch dressing I didn't use. Iceberg lettuce tends to get a bad rap from foodies for reasons I don't understand (too commonplace?), but I like having a salad like this every so often. The lettuce was fresh and crisp, the plating was as ornate as an ice cream sundae, and the delectable garnishes did more than decorate. 

The service was capable, and the clientele was well-behaved. I could see myself eating here regularly without worrying about getting a stool broken over my back. A rowdy dive bar this isn't. Rather, it's a comfortable, quiet neighborhood watering hole where people go to escape from toxic co-workers and a day's worth of on-the-clock bullshit."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now and sat at the bar both times. The first time I had the goat cheese and pesto dip...WOW. I also had pizza with the thickest bacon I've ever seen on it. Another WOW. The second time I was there, I had the steak quesadillas which maybe weren't the best I've ever had, but still quite good. The best part was the horseradish aioli. I would pour that down my throat by itself. They make everything from scratch here which is amazing! I highly recommend. Servers have always been pleasant and attentive as well."}
{"text":"Nice looking place.  Staff is friendly enough.  

I won't be eating here however.  As a chef myself I know what food storage containers look like.  When the bar tender left the bar, to clean the ladies bath room with a cambro from the kitchen with soapy water in it I wanted to throw up. Not only did the lady serving drinks to me go to scrub the ladies toilet but she used food storage container as a bucket.  Totally gross.   Won't be back here ever."}
{"text":"Wow! What a disappointment! I walked in, took a table in back, next to a foursome.BIG mistake; should've sat at the bar. 

The bartender appeared attentive to her customers. Not my server, a short,  overweight, pony tailed, brunette. After several minutes, she passed me (no greeting) and went right over to them, happily took their drink orders. Passed me again. Still no greeting. Came by, put a menu on the table (nope, no greeting), and turned to leave, but I buttonholed her for a drink, my old friend, Mike. Another mistake. I ordered two crab cakes  Mistake #3.

She brought the foursome's drinks, took their orders, and disappeared. Served their orders, disappeared. Almost a half hour later, my crabcakes appeared. They were quite brown, so I hoped they were a bit crispy on the outside. No such luck. They were very creamy, bland, and browned. They were a decent portion for an appetizer, and perfect for me, since I'm not a big eater (portion-wise).

I asked for the check after she brought my food. The Mike's was almost $6; my crabcakes were $8.50. Wow. She had installed herself at a table near me to prep lemons and limes.  That was the most I had seen her, so I was cool with that. However, when I was a server, I would never do prep work like that in the D.R., especially on a Saturday night. But hey, she only gawd 5 of us. Even she could handle that."}
{"text":"Five stars for the price. Great local bar that serves better than regular bar food with different specials every nite. Bacon sticks are a must! We went on Tuesday nite for free wing nite. They currently offer 3 free wings per beer from 6-8 pm Tuesdays. We had the afterburner, garlic parm, burn your face off and honey jalapeño flavors to share with our beers. They were all tasty but could have used some extra hot sauce. The wings are prepped brined and crispy- no complaints here. The bacon sticks are a crave worthy reason to return on Monday nite bacon nites--super delicious. It's not a romantic date place, but we can add this to our list of Pens game bars to go to with great food and atmosphere. 


5.22.18: went back with my friend. Ordered Jamison's pulled pork fries and split a proper order of wings.Pulled pork fries eats like a meal. Both very good. Added pics to review. Will eventually go back to target their hamburgers. Can't wait. :)"}
{"text":"My favorite Dormont bar.  Great atmosphere, and great bar food, particularly the basi burgers."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time to eat this evening. We got 2 appetizers to start, the crab cakes and bacon sticks. Both were amazing!!! Then I ordered the strip steak special, it was cooked to a perfect rare temperature and was paired perfectly with a baked potatoes and vegetables!! My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich with the chipotle barbeque sauce paired with French fries, he said it was one of the best sandwiches he's ever had and the fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned. We will definitely be returning in the future!!! Our experience was more enhanced by our server, Amanda. She was an amazing and attentive to server, always making sure we had everything we needed from start to finish!!! Thank you for a wonderful dining experience!!"}
