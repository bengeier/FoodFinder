{"text":"We were craving Asian food (Korean or Japanese) before our movie so we headed to the foodcourt below. Because they are currently renovating, we didn't have that much choice so we opted for this place.  They have sushi but we wanted hot food. The food is made to order so it can take long. He warned us though that it would take 10mins and I think it ended up taking 15.  Each dish was served with a watery tomato soup which I did not eat. The chicken dumplings plate was really yummy, I would totally eat that again. The chicken katsu plate was a massive portion and pretty tasty. The beef plate was the most disappointing. While the flavour was good, it was cheap meat full of fat and cartilage.  Not bad for a food court - especially considering there aren't many Asian options but wouldn't be happy if this was at a real restaurant where we are paying a higher price."}
{"text":"Used to come to this place as a sure bet eat before movies. The food was well cooked by Koreans serving katsu, udon or makis. Now owned by Chinese and the quality downfell to avoidance. Sorry!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite restaurant in this food court. It is very difficult to find a food court in downtown Montreal with unique choices.  They are usually filled with your typical Thai express, subway and tiki Ming etc. This food court is a little different and this place in particular stands out.  It has sushi choices or meal choices, all served with a nice miso soup. I normally order the fried chicken meal that comes with a nice salad, rice and tempura vegetables. Being in a food court you would assume low quality and unhealthy food but this place does not succumb to these standards. The salad is fresh, the vegetables and chicken are cooked when you order.  I love this place and sometimes walk distances just to eat lunch here. I wish they offered a frequent buyer card ."}
{"text":"This place just opened up at the Peel food court. It is always jam packed with a long line up. However the food is worth it! Huge portions, great prices, 10-14$ for plate, drink and your choice of wonton or miso soup. They have a secret Chinese menu that you need to ask for if you want a special kind of plate. It's written in Chinese so you'll need to ask them to describe the dishes on that menu. I'll be sure to ask them next time."}
