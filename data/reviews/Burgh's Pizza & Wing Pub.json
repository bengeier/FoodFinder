{"text":"Been going here ever since it opened up. Here's the skinny on Burgh's.   The place is packed, and I mean PACKED each and ever Friday and Saturday night. There's a good reason, two actually. One is that they have a very strong, if not quite exceptional selection of draft beer. Pittsburgh and it's 'burbs are more Keystone Light than Chimay, so to find some nifty stuff like Anchor Steam, Paulaner and Dogfish Head  on tap is a strong pull. The second is the food. By and large, the food is among the best you'll find at any sports bar in the US. The wings are very good, the salads are Legendary (go ahead big man. Order the cobb salad  and try to finish it all. Not gonna happen), the pizzas are excellent, and the calzones are hot, crispy, soft and gooey. All good.  The bad. Numero uno is the service. On a good night, you might get a table in half an hour, at which point the waitress might pay attention to you. On a bad night, it could be over an hour to get a table and then you'll have to flag down a waiter/waitress every time you want something. Numero dos is the decor (if you can call it that). This place is tired, the carpeting was filthy five years ago and has gone downhill from there, many of the booths have holes in them, the bar floor is never clean, and the kitchen is....ehhhhh. Final problem is the lack of parking. The lot next door quickly fills up and it can be a royal hassle to find a spot.  In all, if you like great food and beer, and can look past the really bad service and other issues, Burgh's is a great place. The fact that they have virtually no competition within 5 miles is another reason why they are busy. If they had a competitior open up that had food as good and better service, they would be in SERIOUS trouble."}
{"text":"Gist - 3.5 -4 stars Come here if you can't decide where else to eat  but nothing else is open and you're in the mood for basic American / Italian food as this is a decent place to get good portions of food at a good price & open late is a plus; also good place to watch the Pens   Food:  * Wings - the garlic honey wings are really just yummy goodness; I've never seen this elsewhere  * Calzone - good cheesy fillin' & could've fed 3 pl  * Spinach Salad - really fresh & as it has strawberries, cranberries and cheese - good portion too!   Service - the waitress was really nice and on-top of all the refills"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area without question! Very attentive n friendly owners. Bartenders are top notch. No better place to take the family out for food n fun. Not a place to hang out with ur friends n party unless all over 45 though. Top draw, I never had a food item I didn't enjoy. Great variety."}
{"text":"Best pizza around. Great beer selection. Some awesome sandwiches and wings.  fav pizza - hot n spicy -pep, sausage, and fresh sliced banana pepper on sauce splashed with red hot  Fav sammich - 1- Best Rueben 1a - any of the Tomwiches (just like primantis, less the slaw) Fav wings - hot garlic Fav app-Hungarian hot peppers and the pretzels  Wish list - how bout a Rueben pizza on the menu?  Having patronized this rest since they opened, the food has always been good. Wait service can be sketchy, bartenders always nice. One disturbing trend is that the whole place seems dirtier and dirtier. Get a better cleaning crew guys. The bathrooms did recently get a much needed update."}
{"text":"I come from Michigan and I have to stop in everytime I am in Pittsburgh.  Best deep dish I have had amd the beer selection is outstanding."}
{"text":"Sorry to see all of the negative reviews, because I think this place is great! I have been going here for a while and have never had any problems, and the food is always excellent. I think they have some of the best wings in the area. I always get the blackened gold sauce. I think it's a mix of honey mustard and bbq...something like that. Until recently I had always had the regular fried wings , which were always fully cooked and tasty. I recently tried the cajun style wings, and they are awesome. I'm not sure how to describe them...I guess  you could call them blackened. The menu says they could take up to an additional 30 minutes, but I'm not sure they ever have. If so, they are worth it. As for the pizza, we always get the traditional style, and  it has always been excellent. Crispy crust and the right amount of sauce. Sometimes a little too cheesy for me, but I don't mind. I usually go on one of the beer special nights, one has a bottle special, and one has a draft special. They always seem to have a good selection, and have never been out of what I order.  The service has always been good to me even though it is always packed. That is the only complaint for me, and I suppose it is a good thing...they are always packed when I have been there, weeknight or weekend!"}
{"text":"Food quality has gone way down.  I know it is a pub, but even a pub needs some minimal standards for food quality. Hope it changes some day."}
{"text":"Their meat trio deep dish pizza was simply awesome. In fact, it was one of the best deep dish pizzas that I have outside Chicago and it reminded me alot of Chicago's Ginos East.  It was also turned out to be one of the best cold pizzas I have had as well and usually deep dish pizzas don't taste well after they cooled, but the Burgh's pizza was great.  We had our pizza picked up from a friend, so I cannot speak to the establishment or it's staff, but next time I am in town I will certainly go and try some pizza fresh from the oven."}
{"text":"This place is awful! I have been here twice and both times were terrible. The cooks are straight up on meth and the waitresses are so nasty! We had guacamole that was $8 and it came with stale chips and giant tomatoes! It wasn't even mixed together. I ordered 4 separate beers on tap- they were out of all of them! Won't ever ever go back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place that has great pizza and wings, this is the place.  If you are looking for a place that cares about their customers and cares about their service be warned...this is NOT the place.    There is no denying their pizza and wings (what they are known for) are delicious and clearly the only reason why people come back. But to me it is not worth the service experience you will receive - this includes both dining in and taking out.    Customer service starts at the top and the top here is broken!"}
{"text":"I was a little baffled by the negative reviews on this place.  If they were charging prices consistent with the Capital Grille or Eleven then I could see people complaining about the food.  However, their food is priced according to the quality.  It is very decent bar food at an affordable cost.  Maybe with the sluggish economy yinzers are expecting more bang for their buck.  You get what you pay for.  This is classic bar food and it is appropriately priced.  They do have a great selection of beers too and I love microbrews.  I've been there a couple times during March madness or during football season to hang out with a friend and watch the game and we always got great service.  Even though I live in the heart of the city I would still stop by Burgh's for a bite when I'm in the area.  Their baked cajun wings are to die for and totally worth the wait:  they do take longer since they are baked in the oven and not fried.  Keep up the good work Burgh's!"}
{"text":"Best buffet brunch around especially if you love soups, salads, pizza & wings, dessert & a beverage all included for a very reasonable price! But you just may need a nap from all that food ;-) Great for the whole family with games & sports tv everywhere."}
{"text":"Great experience today.  Good food, great service!  Great place to take friends from out of town to show off a real Pittsburgh eatery.  Thank you , we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The service at Burgh's is consistently horrible, with a 45 minute wait just for drinks being a common issue. However, the food is pretty good. The pizza especially is above average, but the service and slow pace of every employee there detracts from just how good the pizza is."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I have ever had in my entire life! The deep dish pizza takes longer to bake, but it is most certainly worth the wait.   Their wings are also a step above your typical pizza joint's. They have a lot of meat on the bone and their sauces are delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, beer was cold.  Great variety of both, service was fine.  I will return for more, the Rafa was delicious, I highly recommend.  A+"}
{"text":"It was a bit crowded, but we went at dinner time just before a Pens game so that gets a pass. We only got their thin crust pizza with extra cheese, but it was one of the better ones I've had. There was actually plenty of cheese (unlike the big pizza chains) and there was a perfect amount of sauce. The crust was nice and crispy, too, which is what I want out of a thin crust pizza. Service was quick and friendly, and most importantly, the beer selection was impressive."}
{"text":"Sometimes I have a great time at burghs while others it's like why did I even bother.   They have a fantastic selection of beer and the bartenders are usually very nice  My biggest problem is how long the food takes. It seems to be either 5 minutes or 55 minutes and I can't figure it.   But if you have time to kill and want to enjoy a beer and watch a game. Burgh's is a great sopt"}
{"text":"User J.K. stated my previous review was too vague...so here is a more specific review: I've gone to Burgh's several times in the past. All of the negative reviews, I can attest to. I've never received good service while dining at Burgh's. the last visit in particular, I ordered the guacamole appetizer to start. I was told they had no avocados...then, for some strange reason, I was told by my server that the manager had a few in his office?!  Out comes mashed avocados with tortilla chips...not guacamole! It is more than just mashed avocados. The server never refilled our beverages...not once. Our pizza was kind of mushy in the middle, as if the middle wasn't cooked all the way. I didn't finish my first slice. Just sat and waited for our server to check on us. When she returned, she didn't ask how everything was. She just offered us a box to take our leftovers home. Now, for me to recall that very last dining experience, which I believe was this past summer, it was pretty bad. Even with take out...we have ordered by phone to pick up in, what you are told \"20-25 minutes\". We go in about that time and still wait another 15 minutes. It's frustrating to have such a good location and not give a rats \"you know what\" about your business or the locals who support it. So...just giving a one time example takes up this much space...I have to be vague. These reviews, I believe, are very true to their nature, because going there on my own free will on several occasions, receiving the same bad service with occasionally good pizza, isn't worth my hard earned money. I'll spend it at Cucina Bella, where the food AND service is always great! I hope that was more detailed for you :-)"}
{"text":"Worst service i have has in a long time. Over priced BPWP fries (don't order not worth 10 dollars). Our waitress forgot our salad; waited over 20 minutes for the salad to come out and the only reason it came out is we saw another table who sat 20 minutes after us get a salad delivered; Our waitress went to \"check\" on ours and brought it right out after everyone else had finished their food at this point. We never received our wings that we ordered and then had the nerve to still try and charge us for the side of blue cheese with the wings. Please save yourself the 40 dollars you will spend here and go somewhere else. Service is crap food is mediocre at this point. This establishment use to be alot better."}
{"text":"While the food is good, the service is not. I was there once and it literally took over an hour to get my food after I ordered and the second time I was there it took around 45 minutes. I would give 5 stars easily if there was simply better service than what they currently have."}
{"text":"Incredible bar food and beer selection.  Wings and Pizza are as good as you'll find in the Bridgeville area and the bar atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"This place is subpar. Nice if you're trying to catch a game but the service isn't all that great. Yeah, our waiter was nice but I think we literally had 3 interactions with him the whole night. Once when he took our order, once when he brought us food, and once for the check.  The food is also not that spectacular. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad and it was just lettuce and dry chicken and Caesar dressing. My friend ordered the Super chicken pizza and that was actually really great. My other friend ordered the pierogie appetizer and they were so hard.  Since it's conveniently located close to work, I'll probably be returning. Hopefully the service is a lot better next time!"}
{"text":"Disregard my previous post as I thought someone had stole my information from this place.  It turns out that it was a misunderstanding by the police in that area.  So in regards to that I'm going to give my original review of this place.  The food was very good.  I had the Curtiss sandwich because, well... isn't it obvious?  Anything that has pastrami, egg, and bacon, all on the same thing is totally me(Its practically what I order as Primanti Brothers everytime)  As far as the customer service, I had no complaints, but I will say that we were a party of two.  Probably is pretty crappy for parties of 4 as we noticed people waiting around for awhile after we were seated.  The prices were reasonable and they had a huge selection of good beers to choose from."}
{"text":"I will never to here again! It took 10 minutes for the waitress to get us water and on top of that the manager told us too move seats if we wanted to see the tv we wanted. Worst service I've seen in a long time!"}
{"text":"Not for the food but the terrific service. We sat in a nearly empty restaurant for 20 minutes until someone waited on us. Ordered drinks and food and waited 15 for drinks. My daughter got her drink and yet I still wait. Food comes, well my daughter's and my side of vegetables. This is after another 20 minutes. Waitress said 1 minute left on my burger. Daughter asks for a plate, that takes 5 minutes. Now I still sit, 10 minutes after my daughters food came and still no burger. Food is good but something is severely off with food and waitstaff."}
{"text":"A quintessential Pittsburgh sports bar in Bridgeville which is a great place to grab a fresh burger, a brew (or 2) from their expansive list, and take in a Pens game. They also make a great pizza. The service is prompt and friendly. If we lived closer, we would be regulars for sure."}
{"text":"The BEST pizza.  The atmosphere isn't perfect but it could be worse.  If you are in the area, the lunch buffet is very good too."}
{"text":"First time here. Will be back! Glad we didn't read the reviews until we were already seated. They DO need a sign that says to see the host,etc because we had to ask the guys standing in front of us if it was a \"seat yourself\". The \"host\" was certainly not paying any attention to guest walking in the door. We had to put our name on the list and were not told how long the wait was (maybe a more attentive host would help give a better rating). We only waited 5 min to be seated; in the bar area. Our server Shannon was very friendly and when we told her this was our first visit, she told us what they r known for (pizza and wings). We decided to try the (5) wings as an app and a toss salad to start. The wings had great flavor and meaty. We wanted to steer away from the usual pepperoni pizza so we ordered the \"super chicken white pizza\" and added bacon! It was very tasty! We loved the crust! It was a little dry...not much sauce, but the chicken was tender and plenty of broccoli. A small was more than enough for the two of us considering we had the wings and salad. She told us the burgers r huge and very good so we plan to come back to try one. Atmosphere is typical friendly local bar. Looking forward to returning for a burger.    Try it...you'll like it!!"}
{"text":"Solid pie that was great as the last meal of the day. Special tonight was free Gouda or cheddar cheese as a topper, which we took advantage of!  Don't forget the ranch dressing as a crust dipper, excellent!"}
{"text":"Where can you wait an hour for bad over-priced food while watching a pregnant woman chain smoke and drink 2-3 beers?  Welcome to Burgh's.  There has always been something magical about this specific location.  I remember back in the days when this was the site of the Galaxy theater, where I got to watch ET and First Blood Part 2 in a double feature (back in the 80s).  Burgh's somehow lacks the class of the Galaxy theater.  But you can expect a bad pizza bar for lunch, fantastic deep fried pretzels with the world's best honey-mustard, a nice selection of beers (hurray for the Belgian revolution), and some townie sight-seeing.  I feel at home already."}
{"text":"Probably the best sports bar in western PA! It is always a crowed place with the locals watching a game and visiting with friends. The food is tremendous and they will always accommodate in how you want the food prepared. Wings are cooked to perfection and the pepperoni dream is truly amazing. You may have to wait for a table, but they provides an opportunity to grab a drink, visit with the locals, and play a game of pool. If you need a place to watch a game or relax after a busy week--then this is your place!"}
{"text":"The wings were almost dried out. They had little flavor to them. The fries are frozen w generic cheese sauce. A few of the frisson the platter were cold. Beer specials were good and the pizza is pretty good."}
{"text":"Been there 4 times and have no idea why.  It's sad bc their food is pretty good but service is not so good.  When asked about the beer specials I was told there weren't any. I then asked the server ok well why does the sign say there is? She then started to retract her statement and tell us there indeed is. This is only one example. Every time we have been it seems as though no server wants to be there and are unable to answer any questions.  Like I said food is good, so if we ever go back it will be for take out!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and a good variety of choices.  Wings and pizza are notably good, I've also tried the stromboli and sandwiches, which I would certainly get again.  You can build your own pie with their lists of toppings or choose one of their pre-designed pizzas, which I really like, for variety.  I don't drink beer but they have an extensive selection that my bf loves.  Also a fun place to watch Steelers or Pens games!  My only beef is their customer service, I've had spotty service each time I've been here, waitresses that don't check on tables and refill drinks, etc.  It is always busy when I'm here so that could contribute to the problem.  Worth the trip though, the food is delish."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for the lunch buffet in about 4 or 5 weeks. New format 11 dollars for salad and pizza and if you want to add 10 wings its $2. And they'll only bring them to you in a 4-4-2 grouping. This place was on the friday lunch rotation and the group i was with said its off the list. Should have just added $2 to the buffet price. Dissappointing."}
{"text":"I don't care if the pizza is good!! Staff and owner are terrible. I've been hanging here kinda regular. They treated us so poorly tonight . We won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Burgh's is consistently great pizza and has a wonderful selection of beer. I've tried other things they make from their lunch buffet - wings are average, salad bar has some refreshing choices, but limited dressing selection, sandwiches are generous. However, the pizza is what you come here for. Many TV's for sports fans, and this is a popular destination for fans to hang out and watch anything from the PGA Tour to the Steelers game."}
{"text":"Top 5 best pizza in the Pittsburgh area (try original deck 2). Best Calzone in the area (Italian). Great wings  (try honey bbq). Great tap beer selection. One of my favorite restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Burgh's is about a 4 star restaurants with a less than 1 star staff.  The service could not be any worse than it is.  You will always be waiting on an un-informed and un-trained wait staff for everything you have to do here from drink orders to food orders to getting food to getting the check.  The food is very good I have never had bad food here and the beer selection is not bad my wife and I attemp burgh's about once a year each time hoping they fixed there service issuse always to be disappointed."}
{"text":"For a restaurant with \"wing\" in the name I was expecting more. I ordered honey BBQ wings with a side of fries. The honey BBQ sauce was odd; tasted more like mild hot sauce with absolutely no flavor. I would possibly try this place again as the restaurant was clean and the server was attentive, but would never order wings again."}
{"text":"This rating is for the wings only. I had them once 7 months ago inside and today carryout. In general I don't think anybody has good wings in Pittsburgh. These wings are rancid. You can smell the oil seeping from the carry out bag. At first glance they were seriously overcooked. Could be nasty old oil being it was 8pm. Most likely its cheap oil and they use it all day to save money. I remember thinking this my first time getting them. My first bite finished with a glistening of lip gloss oil on my lips and fingers. I will expect to be hitting the bathroom all night with diarrhea from consumption of mass amounts of oil."}
{"text":"We had the plain nachos as an appetizer and the cheese comes in a small cup, perfect for double dipping and lots of nasties. The cheese had burnt cheese in it and instead of jalapeno peppers they served banana peppers.  The pizza has a nice tomato chunk sauce which I enjoyed but the dough was burnt as it has been in the past. At $22 for a large with pepperoni they had better send out better pizzas.   The misses ordered a Reuben and it was bland and flavorless. It did add flavor to her bowel movement in the next hour though. .   The young man serving us was good and courteous so he gets a high five. In conclusion I try to support local establishments but I'm DONE with Burghs. They dont deserve my business anymore."}
{"text":"Good thing the food is good because the service, cleanliness, and general environment are sub par. Ordered side salads and they came two minutes before our pizza, after waiting nearly 30 minutes!  Our drinks sat empty and trying to get your servers attention is near impossible because she's fraternizing with the other wait staff and floor manager behind the bar. Let's not even mention the welcome when you try to put your name on the list. Unless you're a regular here I wouldn't bother because the service is most unpleasant. My suggestion is take out. This place needs a heaping helping of Robert Irvine and Restaurant Impossible!"}
{"text":"We go to 'Burgh's Pizza and Wing Pub often for the lunch buffet of all you can eat salad, pizza and wings. I guess I do judge a book by its' cover, because the first time we went here I was surprised at the quality of the salad bar at a place that has \"Pub\" in it's name. There are the usual greens and raw veggies, long with a wonderful selection of marinated vegetables, roasted red peppers, beets, cheeses and toppings. They make their own salad dressings, and they're really good. The pizza is great, and they bring out a nice variety of vegetarian and meat pizzas, even a white pizza. The wings are the real draw for me, however. Usually they have a choice of three, with mild, garlic and honey, BBQ, spicy and \"kinda\" breaded as recent options. A drink is included in the price of the lunch buffet. They have a great beer selection, and they cater and do special parties, too. I can't think of a better place to hang out and watch a game on one of their 19 plasma screens.The one misstep in a recent dinner outing there was the blackened tuna salad, which was overcooked and not great quality tuna, but what the heck was I doing ordering that there, anyway? Pizza. Wings. Beer. Good salad bar=bonus. Service is friendly and efficient, and the staff seems to know alot of the regulars who come in.  We're lucky to have this place near us!"}
{"text":"The absolute WORST restaurant I have been to this year. I realize it is only February of 2012 and it's very early to make such a bold statement, but this place really is as horrible as I say it is. Let me paint the picture for you: I went to grab a quick bite to eat here with my parents and their bowling league team members before the game started. There are a few other joints close by, but this one seemed like it would be the most accommodating for such a large group with deadlines to meet. When we got there, they were very quick to seat us.. the only perk of our outing. After waiting about 15 minutes to be acknowledged by our server, we grew restless and had to go to the bar area to order our drinks. When we all had drinks, our server stumbled over to the table and asked if we wanted to place drink orders. (This really happened..) One of the members of our party was quick to finish her drink, so she placed an order for a Corona, which I thought was a very simple request. She returned TWENTY MINUTES LATER with a Coors Light. It was obvious that English was not her first language, but you really should be able to process simple requests if you are to be in an English-speaking serving industry. She then took our order for the food, which was a fiasco. She could not grasp the flavor of wings that I wanted. The menu is expansive, which was nice, but they only offered 3 wing flavors. This is normally perfectly fine as I typically don't steer away from buffalo. The problem was that the waitress 1.) did not know the flavors of wings that the restaurant offered and 2.) denied vehemently that they served buffalo wings. I ended up just telling her to bring me wings of any flavor just to get food before we had to leave. The amusing part of this was that she did end up bringing buffalo wings.. though the restaurant definitely did not serve them. The food was relatively quick to come out of the kitchen, which was nice. The only bad part was that some of my wings, in addition to another party member's burger, were cold on the inside. I'm not sure how wings can be fried to death on the outside (gross) but also be cold on the inside. Magic. Once everyone finished eating their subpar food, it came time for the check. This took forever as you can imagine because we had about 4 different parties at our table that required a separate check. The checks were horribly mangled, but because of our time constraint, everyone decided to settle the bill portions with cash. This place is a dump, do NOT waste your time going here. Our table was seated next to a large window that was so poorly installed, we all wore our coats throughout the meal. The interior of a restaurant should not be slightly warmer than outside in the dead of winter. All in all, this place is not worth your time unless you enjoy subpar service/food."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service..ended up seating myself because no one was around after a good 5 min to seat us, then the waitress took FOREVER to both notice us and get simple drinks.    Eventually, once the waitress realized we were a paying customer, we were able to order wings and pizza.  After an enormous amount of time without offers of alcohol refills, we were served greasy wings with common obviously warehouse sauces. Again, no drink refills.    The pizza came a good 30 minutes later so half our group got to watch each other eat.  The pizza was odd tasting.  Service:  Abysmal,  Food:  Not matching the hype."}
{"text":"Amazing wings ... Fried crispy! Service was slow on them the first time I went but the wait was worth it! Pizza and wings were excellent! I will be back as much as I can! Anti pasta Platter was amazing as well! Family friendly my kids enjoyed themselves and they had a couple arcade games."}
{"text":"Stopped in after golf with some friends.  Been here a few times in the past.  I really enjoy the beer selection they have here, both on tap and in bottles.  It is a pretty decent list of beers across many styles and countries.  The beer menu is nicely organized by beer style.  The list is continually updated as well.   Breweries they offer include Troeg's, Great Lakes, Deschutes, Anchor, Southern Tier, Ommegang, Flying Dog...plus your macro's.  They also have a fully stocked bar for other drinks and wine.   They have a small section with beer on shelves and in coolers where are you are allowed to beverages to go.  Mix and match, 6 packs, larger format beers...etc.     They have all sorts of pub food.  Most notable are their pizza and wings.  They also offer, burgers, salads, appetizers, calzones, soups, sandwiches and hoagies.  The pizza is usually really good with a nice crust.  I have had a few soggier crust pizzas, but that is not the norm.  I really like the wings here.  My favorites are the cajun wings.   I have never had any issues with the service.  The servers are usually pretty nice and efficient.  The place can get pretty crowded so a seat at the bar may be difficult.  Overall this is a good place to visit if you are in Bridgeville."}
{"text":"Horrible service time, waitedA full hour for our food to be brought to our table and when it was the waitress said oh I'm sorry our burger man just got here.Food was below sub par, didn't even finish what was ordered. In the end all we wanted to do was leave and after the girl asked us if we needed our check it still took another 10 minutes to get the check. Waste of 50$ and won't be back"}
{"text":"Burgh's is one of my absolute favorite \"go to\" places! We love trying new places to eat and we really have to like a place to keep going back.  Burgh's is definitely one of those places!!!  The menu has something for everyone and I've never been disappointed with anything that I've ordered. The pizza is some of the best around and the wings win hands down as my all time favorite!!  They're always cooked perfectly crispy and the sauces are phenonmenal!!!  The beer selection is outstanding.  Service can be slow at times - Fridays and Saturdays are always packed, so yes, expect a wait.  But overall, Burgh's is hard to beat!!"}
{"text":"This use to be a great place with great food and service. Not anymore. My wings we over cooked and were like eating rubber, and the provolone wedges were cooked so long the cheese had run out in the fryer. They brought 3 of our 4 meals out to the table, and the 4th meal was delivered to our table over 10 minutes later."}
{"text":"This is too funny , my whole family went to Burgs last nite . They tell us a short wait so we go to the bar waiting and waiting so we ask the bartender if we can order wings now as its 30-35 minutes to cook . She says sure . So we order assuming will sit soon only to find our table was giving away !! My wife and daughters find the manager Tom as he seemed bothered and unwilling to help so we decide to leave . He says you have an order in for about 70 dollars we said yes we do but if you can't seat us we're leaving and he says I'll call the police at that comment I stand up and let him know , look dude you've given the girls a hard time with seating and now your calling the police lol , to funny so I said you do that , please call them . I'll wait for this just to make a complete fool out of you . He got snippy with me saying I don't appreciated that and we left .    Not sure who Tom is but he's sure a fine representative of Burgs , we won't return that's certain !!  I had to place 1 star above just to enter a review . Classy operation !!!!"}
{"text":"I went in without high expectations, but left pretty happy! At the end of day it's bar food, but in most cases, a lot better!   We started with splitting the wings, they were the perfect amount of crispy for me! I don't really remember the sauce, but I know it wasn't bad, just not memorable.   I got a steak hoagie and it was very good! I love their mix of toppings and sauces and the meat was so fresh!!  My hubby got a calzone that was HUGE for $10. It was big enough for 3 meals!!  I would definitely go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Pizza has been great, wings too. Beer prices are way better than I'm used to up the road at The Sharp Edge.   Have to say, service ain't bad either. I count 17 tv's from my seat at the bar. BRAVO"}
{"text":"Their wings and pizza are both amazing and their beer selection is really good too. I noticed a lot of negative reviews based on poor service, but luckily, that has not been my experience."}
{"text":"excellent food consistently ruined by poor service. the servers dont't care if you are happy and care even less to hear about it. our party of three waited tonight for no less than 10 minutes to be acknowledged and asked for a drink order which was begrudgingly refilled half as many times as necessary. the food came out in random order rather than together as ordered and we were definitely charged for the extra ranch that we never received. i come back for the pizza which is the best for miles around and tolerate the service.  bad attitudes, servers drop your food & never come back, managers nowhere to be found. get take out instead."}
{"text":"What a Pittsburgh gem! In my opinion, this page is worth the trip from surrounding areas. My husband and I drove from downtown Pittsburgh to Bridgeville just to have their amazing wings and pizza. They are very gluten-free and allergen free friendly, providing me with oven-baked wings (gluten free, soy free) and a homemade buffalo sauce. My husband got the Chicago-style deep dish pizza and basically made love to it because it was so good. There are lots of TVs around the bar and dining room, so you'll never miss part of the game. They have a huge beer list (I mean HUGE - pages!), wines, mixed drinks, and other typical sports bar fare. My only con is the very slow service. Overall, worth the trip and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Tables in the front are a little crowded together, my wife and I were not crazy about the seating, but it didn't ruin the experience.  Good view of multiple sports on TVs from most seats in the front.  The real advantage was that they had dozens of beers on tap, and a nice variety at that. The food was okay, standard pub fare.  We came in right at 5:30, and they apparently got slammed in the kitchen that night, delaying my burger coming out.  It was half an hour or more late and not exactly what I ordered, but I can forgive them considering I wasn't in a hurry and didn't really care at that point (I can say that if this were a regular occurrence there, I'd drop them down to 2 stars, but the waitress seemed sufficiently flustered by it that it seemed a rare occurrence.  She was gracious enough to take both the burger and the beer that I had while waiting off my tab, so no complaints).  All in all, I'd do it again without hesitation, I'd like to go when I am hungrier than I was to explore their menu a bit more (though again, if I was hungry and in any kind of hurry, this experience would have been in the 2-star range).  Recommended."}
{"text":"Great food & awesome Pizza. Lots of Yinzers. Good beer selection. Service is below ave, gossipy, & not the nicest. They are busy so give them a break I suppose."}
{"text":"Good size portion, fast friendly staff. Food up quickly. Nice variety of beers. I would go back!"}
{"text":"It's not bad, but not that impressive. My most recent visit was worst than before, so I'm not sure if our waitress had a bad night or if the place has gone downhill a bit. My burger was okay, but it was NOT the burger I ordered. I figured it was close enough and better for me than what I ordered, but I placed a simple order and it wasn't loud...  I have no real need to return."}
{"text":"Pretty standard bar food that is consistent   The lunch buffet is hit or miss but the food is usually pretty good.   Been several times for lunch and the attention to buffet has been weak. Not enough pizza's ready and usually mad rush when refills are delivered.   Pizza is above average and chef carved meat for sandwiches set this place apart"}
{"text":"A 4 with better service, their namesake pizza and wings are always VERY good. I'm not self-righteous enough to taint a review for someone not being on my political spectrum, but the bar can be a little busy at times and it seems like they're always one person short in terms of servers present. That being said, everyone has been pleasant, just stretched a little thin at peak times."}
{"text":"Came in late Wednesday night after hearing rave reviews of this place from a colleague. The place was pretty subdued but there were quite a few people out, in my opinion for it being work day.  We started out our meal with the hot garlic wings which had perfectly crisped skin and was mmm so delicious! Followed this with a custom made garlic crust pizza. I have never have a garlic crust pizza and was amazed and impressed by this...The crust set this pizza apart from the numerous other pizzas I have eaten in my lifetime. It was crunchy, flavorful and can be eaten just by itself...I would say it is an elevated version of a garlic bread. Definitely try some of the garlic dough pizzas!   I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive variety of beers they carried from across the country and the world. My friend was a little taken aback by the $10 tag attached to a bottle of Belgian beer but he relished every last drop of it!!  Overall: a great place to come to amazing Pizza, wings and a wide variety of beer selections!"}
{"text":"Wings are awesome!  The lunch buffet is usually really good, with a good selection.  Not the healthiest food in town, but when you want fried chicken... this is a good place to go.  Pizza is kinda mehhh, but not bad."}
{"text":"This review isn't about the food. I've never eaten there and will be unlikely to do so in the future. Let me explain why.   In December of 2016 my Water Arobics class decided that a holiday party would be fun. Someone from our group called and reserved their party area for our group. We would have brought 30 to 40 people into the restaurant.    The day before the event our planner called to make sure everything was in order. They were told the manager had received a better offer and reserved the room for another group. This produced a logistical nightmare for us. We had to locate another venue, notify 50 people and deal with deposits and menu selections. This was at the height of the holiday season.   The management never offered us an apology or any compensation for the inconvenience. They may have booked a larger party, but they lost any chance of us even considering them again."}
{"text":"Burgh's is a long time favorite of mine. We've been coming here since I was a child for pizza and wings as family. The Burgh's used to be much smaller venue, but over the years they've grown their space to include two bars, a party room, and more tables then ever before.  Unfortunately, I'm now gluten free, but Burgh's wings and GF pizza are both safe for me. My favorite pizza is still the five cheese pizza (on a gluten free crust) since it has ricotta cheese on it. The servers make you feel like family while you are here, but you should expect to wait for a table on busy weekend nights."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The server was nice but we waited well over an hour for food. 2 burgers came out and we still had none of the 2 pizzas we ordered. I will not be back. Ever!"}
{"text":"Just tried Burgh's Wings & Pizza last night. Although the croud was wayyy to much for the building , the wings were really good. I would recommend the Golden Tangy . Those were my favorite.  Kinda pricey , but might be worth it. I Agree with Matt K, I don't think they deserve such a low score here. buncha foodie snobs i guess ?"}
{"text":"Took a long time to venture in here but made it in the end. Wings are OK but tend to be dripping in sauce, although you can go for the dry rub. Average pizza. Beer choice is excellent. A bit pricy for the quality of the food, and sometimes (as pointed out by others) the service is a bit sketchy. If I come back, I do, and if I don't, I won't miss it too much."}
{"text":"Getting 3 stars because the food is decent. Sadly they did away with happy hour and service is not the most attentive.  Avoid the weekend's when kids finish soccer, football  or basketball games, like a prior post said those times are crazy with suburban soccer mom's and their brood."}
{"text":"Spoke to the rudest man I have ever met in my life, then I found out he was the owner. Yikes, stay away."}
{"text":"Food was good but served in stages Prior to this evening I had eaten at Burghs about a dozen or so times in the last several years but tonight might just have been the last. For being a Friday night I figured that we would have to wait for a table for 5 but our wait was short (maybe 10-15mins), we were sat and our waitress took drink orders pretty quickly, was patient when a member of our party needed a little extra time deciding what to order to eat. None of us ordered anything complicated. I ordered wings and fries, the waitress even asked if I wanted my fries with dinner or as an app and I answered with dinner. About 15mins after taking our order out came my fries and nothing else. It was another 15 mins when the wings arrived (mine and 2 other members of my party). It took about 30mins for the waitress to bring the calzones that my friends ordered but not the 3rd calzone and another order of fries that was ordered. Never once did she return to check on us. A member of our party searched out a busboy to find a manager then the waitress to find where the missing calzone was. Finally the last portion of our meals arrived just as the manager did. Not that he did any good. We had to ask waitress to split the check and had to \"remind her\" what each of us ordered. We paid our tabs and started out the door. On the way out a member of out party spoke with the bartender explaining our evening as the waitress listened in. Next thing we know she followed us out with $10 worth of vouchers to return. Not likely!"}
{"text":"Hi, I'm Ryan Laitinen, and I'm rolling out looking for Pittsburghs greatest Pub Pizza joints. This pub here is doing things big and bold with some truly unexpected flavor combos. Nah, I'm just playing. I mean, they might be, but I had a medium \"classic\" pizza and it was pretty bomb. Lots of seating with 2 bars and plenty of TVs to watch the Chelsea vs Manchester United game end in a 0-0 tie after stoppage time. I'd say this place is a Gooooaaaaallllll!"}
{"text":"I love love love Burgh's! I have been many times, and have never been disappointed! In my opinion, they have the best pizza in Pittsburgh. SO many options, literally something for everyone! I love the white pizza, but I like to switch it up to the buffalo chicken salad every now and then. The salads are jammed packed with vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, roasted red peppers, and even chick peas! Their sauces and dressings are all home made and phenomenal. My husband, on the other hand, refuses to get any thing other than the deep dish pizza and buffalo wings. He loves them that much. I wish we lived closer, because we would probably get take out weekly! Definitely a great sports bar to cheer on your favorite Pittsburgh team!  It's always packed on the weekends, so be prepared to wait a little. Trust me, Burgh's is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and huge fans of the pizza. Tonight we were served a burnt pizza coupled with terrible customer service and it was very disappointing. We experienced long wait times and left paying for the small part of our meal after again waiting longer than necessary. No manager stopped at the table and there was minimal attempt to compensate us for wasting our time for a burnt pizza."}
{"text":"We went here tonight to celebrate National Pizza Day. We couldn't have made a better choice!   We started with wings. They were excellent. Crispy & juice & flavorful. Great!  Then we moved on to the main attraction. The cheese pizza was delicious & the meat pizza (pepperoni & sausage & bacon) was even better!"}
{"text":"This is a decent place to get some pizza or just head to the back and have a few beers. They have a descents selection of beers on tap and a handful of tv's to watch whatever game is on.   Everyone comes here for the lunch buffet, so be prepared because it gets filled up fast. The bar service was quick and they refilled the drinks quick. It's an older place that's been around for a while and you have to leave and walk down an adjoining hallway to use the restrooms, which is different.  Decent food and good service, good place for happy hour or for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Their pizza and wings, when paired up...are the best in the burgh.  Going there late at night is always delicious and when your kitchen is open till 1, it makes things so much better  They have a pepperoni dream pizza that it completely smothered in roni's and their franks hot garlic wings are fierce!  What makes their wings so great is the texture...it's a well done crispy wing, not some mushy, gummy wing that makes you cringe when you try to digest it.  This is a staple of the south hills...it's been around for quite some time and there is a reason why...."}
{"text":"It gets 2 stars because my deep fried soft pretzel was yummy.  Being the first customers in the restaurant (opened at 11, and we were on our lunch hour), we were seated right away - staff was very nice.  And then we waited nearly 20 minutes before anyone came to take our order - in an empty restaurant.  Fried pretzel, tuna melt...that's it.  20 minutes after ordering, we finally got our food.  I've had good food and bad food here - but the service is always consistently horrible.  Boo hiss."}
{"text":"Awful food and rude staff. Came in for takeout and was expecting awesome wings since Burghs pizza and WINGS makes one assume that they're good at making wings. I was wrong. The wings were so overlooked that there was no meat left on the bones! They should've checked my food before I left and made sure it was right. Then I called for a refund and never heard back from a manager. When I first came in the guy (host) said to wait at the bar for my takeout... Then the bartender just stared at me like I had three heads for 5 mins until the host came back and asked my name to get my order because she (bartender) clearly wasn't willing to work! So he brings out my bag and she finally speaks and asks for payment. Took my food home and was so disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer for years. The food is generally good, but the service can be spotty. However, of the last five pizzas I've ordered, three were burnt. Two I sent back, and one I ate because it was less burnt than the one I sent back. Also, I recently went there on a Saturday afternoon to have a couple of beers and some wings and watch some college football. But, someone was playing the juke box, which cuts out the sound from ll twelve TV's in the bar. Basically, one person had hijacked the entire bar from the sports fans who were there. The juke box should be turned off on heavy game days. I'll go back but not as often."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as a warning to others. I like to patron local restaurants and believe I have a high tolerance for bad customer service, but in this case, it was intolerable. We were a party of 4 coming in on a weeknight. This was my first time coming to the Pub, and my hopes were high for good food- but I never had any food, or even a table. There were a few other people waiting for tables, but for the most part the restaurant wasn't busy- in fact, there were a few empty tables we could have easily sat at. We waited over 10 minutes for someone to ask if we were waiting to be seated. Once the hostess got our info, she said it shouldn't be more then 5-minutes of a wait. We watched frustrated, as people finished and left the restaurant, but no one was seating us. After another 15 minutes, I finally got the hostess' attention to see about being sat and she gave me an impolite response that there would be a table soon. After another 15 minutes, I grabbed the manager and asked why we were waiting over half an hour for a table, and again got a rude response that it would be a few more minutes. He then proceeded to stand by the kitchen and ignore us. When we reached the 45 minute mark, my party and I decided to leave. As we walked out, the hostess thanked us for stopping in. We instead went across the street to Sauce, where we were promptly seated and given good service.  It's one thing if the restaurant is packed and there are no tables- it's another thing when 8-10 tables are empty and I'm getting lip service about when I will be seated. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is great for pizza. It's a local spot, a bit pricey however it is well worth it. Their wings are great, we have the spivey garlic. And for pizza. Try their Zesty Italian. I hope this helps, enjoy."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE !! Got here for lunch buffet suppose to be ready by 11:30 it's 11:50 still not out. Wasted half of my lunch hour waiting. I will never be back. Wings badly over cooked."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Bar food. The waitress was annoying and not very nice. I doubt I'll stop back."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for lunchtime pizza buffets.  I don't know of that many in the Pittsburgh area, but one that I find myself regularly frequenting is at Burgh's in Bridgeville.  The buffet is open on weekdays from 11:30-1:30, and it includes all-you-can-eat pizza, soups (two different kinds), salad bar, drink, and dessert, all for one price.  There is also a daily feature that is included in the price, which is available by request from your server.  Daily features are Italian Hoagies on Mondays. Free Wings on Tuesdays (wings are an additional charge to the buffet on days other than Tuesday). Wednesday's feature is \"Beef on Weck,\" which is a freshly sliced roast beef sandwich on a Breadwork's Kimmelweck Caraway seeded sandwich roll and a side of Horseradish and/or Burgh's sauce (Perhaps my favorite of the daily specials).  Thursday is Kielbasi & Kraut day, and Friday = Fish & Chips (fries).  There are usually about four kinds of pizzas on the buffet and are constantly rotated, so you never know what might be on there.  I've seen everything from plain, to pepperoni, to bacon and pineapple, white pizza with spinach and tomato, to sausage, hot peppers, mushrooms, etc.  One time they even had a \"Hamburger\" pizza.  I feel that it is a pretty good lunch buffet, and I usually always leave satisfied, and with a full belly."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I have been here a couple times. The first time I noticed the atmosphere felt like a biker bar with the Attitudes hanging out of course at the bar.   Each time we arrived at the front and hand to stand there waiting, while the employees leaned on the same bar talking not even noticing we were standing there.  This time some guy employee was busy flirting with 2 other female employees. This was blatantly obvious.  He then continues his conversation as he is grabbing silverware and motioning us to follow him to a booth 2 feet from the females leaning on the bar. This is not where we wanted to sit, I attempted to get his attention before he made it to the table and sat the silverware down but was not able to. I finally explained we preferred to sit in the back by the bar. He re sat us in the back, he was walking so fast it was almost like we were an inconvenience to him.  He placed the silverware on the table while we were still walking up. He passed us as we were making our way and pointed back and said your table is there. And he left. As we sat down my date made a comment that she could not believe how rude he was.  We ordered a pizza. Pretty simple task One would think. 45 min later we received this heaping mess that did not even resemble a frozen pizza you would get at Walmart. chunky tomato sauce for miles falling off of the top. The dough so drenched with this crap that the pizza was falling apart as we tried to scoop the mess onto our plates. Our first bite immediately noticed that it was dead cold and must have been sitting in the back for a good 10 minutes. We had ordered sausage mushrooms, pepperoni and extra cheese. There was no sausage but plenty of extra chunky tomatoes.    It took us another 15 minutes to actually see our waitress come back into the room and me waving at her to flag her down. The first words out of her mouth were \"Do we need a box folks?\" Considering we had already been there well over an hour now, and there was barely a bite out of mine and my dates 1 piece each on our plate and the rest of the pizza was not touched. You would think her first words should have been is everything ok?   We explained that the pizza was cold, terrible and an absolute mess and no we are not interested in ordering anything else. We had no desire to wait another hour for our order just for them to screw that up as well.  Instead of taking care of it right then an there she said oh no, i will be right back. We wait another 10 minutes for her to come back with our adjusted bill. I paid for the soft drink and left a 3 dollar tip. Which i thought was over kill for simply pouring a drink and delivery the mess of a pizza we got and never asking if we wanted refills on our drinks.  The prior visit. The pizza was totally different. It was excellent. The wings were an absolute oily mess of a joke. when the waitress sat the wings on the table the first thing i thought about was the last time i had changed the oil in my car. This is not a good thing. I tried the wings, the sauce was horrible. The wings looked like they had been cooked in motor oil.   I can not believe that in this economy where there are millions of people without work that any establishment allows this kind of service and quality of food to pass for even close to ok. I know tons of fellow veterans that are without work and if given the chance to own and operate an establishment they would pour their soul into it thanking the good lord above they can actually earn a paycheck.  Shame on the owners of this dump. 2 strikes these guys are out. What a terrible experience. If you cant do pizza and cook wings when these are your signature items, it is sure time to hang it up."}
{"text":"Wings, pizza, and a monstrous selection of great beers... ah, yes please.  Burgh's has become a staple of mine on each trip to the Burgh to visit my family.  For those of you in, or around, the South Hills, you must stop here.  It's very similar to Fat Heads in Southside.  I'm a big fan of the hot, garlic, and cajun-hot wings.  For the unfamiliar, the cajun-hot come with a blackened, somewhat ashy crust.  The texture can be outputting for some, but the flavor is awesome (fyi - it takes a little extra time for the cajun-hots, so be aware).  My other favorite is the garlic-hot, but it's a mandatory rule that if one person eats them, everyone at the table must eat them (i.e., not recommended for dates).  The true reason to go here is for the beer.  They have over 20 beers on tap (I can't remember the exact number, but I always seem to find something that I haven't tried before), and their bottled beer selection is equally extensive."}
{"text":"The Good: * Pizza & Wings are usually very good.  And everything else on the menu is decent * Excellent beer menu - lots on tap, 100+ bottles * Family friendly  * Very cool bar area that's usually pretty busy  The Bad: * The service is very slow.  I've been there 30+ times and you will NEVER get food under 30 min from when you ordered.  They are either understaffed, poorly managed, or both. * Dirty - The carpet in the dinning room is nasty and every plate is stained. I frequently have had to ask for a new plate either b/c it was dirty or wet * Sports Bar? - There are TV's everywhere, but they don't have the sports packages to be able to show any game.  Everyone is stuck w/ whatever is on the network channel.   * Parking - Good luck.  On a weekend night, you will not be able to find parking.   Overall: Good food and decent atmosphere...But, if there were more places in Bridgeville/South Fayette Burghs would lose a lot of business."}
{"text":"Great wings!! Meaty, a lot of flavors, crunchy!! Burgers are great, thick, juicy. Strombolis are second to none, delicious!! Excellent pizza, just great bar food!!!"}
{"text":"The chef has new energy and life!  There has been a remarkable turn around to the lunch buffet.  Better selection and a better effort to prepare everything with care.  The desserts are heads above where they used to be.  It's just been great this past few visits.  I hope they'll keep up the effort.  Trouble is that every other TV is on FOX and the radio is right wing talk with constant commercials. How is this appropriate for a restaurant?  It's just irritating."}
{"text":"The hubby and I stopped by here last minute for lunch.  The server said that they had a lunch buffet that was getting ready to start.  The buffet included kielbasa and peirogies but you had to ask for them.  You could also get up to 10 wings but you had to ask for those as well.  I went up to the bar and made a salad.  There were lots of choices of items to put on my salad.  As I was doing that the pizzas started coming out.  I took two slices.  The pizza was nice and hot but lacked any flavor.  Bland pizza ruined my appetite.  I ate my salad and left the pizza.  Pizza is one of my favorite foods so it was quite a bummer that I was at a pizza place and left pizza untouched.  Burgh's has been in business many years.  They definitely get a good lunch crowd.  It was almost full when we left.  We had great service, but not great food.  In this case I am going to say that it was just me and I was having an off day.  I will go back another time and try the buffet again.  Next time I will sample the wings as well.  I'll post an update when I go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Burgh's.  They have a decent draft list, and a good selection of bottles, but the pizza and wings are really the reason we go.  Their traditional pizzas are always pretty good but the specialty pizzas are fantastic.  The smoked combo pizza is probably my favorite, but the others are good as well.  The wings are just tasty, they have a bunch of flavors but i would recommend the mild or buff bbq.  The only reason i won't give Burghs five stars is the parking situation, their lot is always full so you have to circle a few times waiting for someone to leave, not so bad if you are going in to sit down and eat, but for takeout orders it can be arduous."}
{"text":"I wish I could provide a full review, but management and the staff were so wrapped in what they were doing that it took 10 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge our party of 4, and we were the only people waiting at 8:30 on a Wednesday evening.  When the manager did acknowledge us, he said he'd be right there, then went to put away clean dishes, do some things on the cash register, etc. He finally sent a waitress over, who told us it would be at least a 10-15 minute wait, even though there were several open tables.  At that point we'd already waited 15 minutes and from the poor customer service it didn't seem like waiting another 15 minutes would be worth it. Instead, we left and went right up the street to Sauce where we were seated immediately and treated like our business was valued. I won't be wasting time again at Burgh's."}
{"text":"The food is awful.  No other way to say it.  My wife, son and I stopped in on our way home from the hockey store, because for some reason I had a thought in my mind that the food was pretty good at one point.  It's been a while, so my thoughts could be correct and time has passed so it may have changed.  It started with my son's nachos that he ordered which we basically Toastetos on a pizza plate, covered with that cheese you get at our local stadiums/arenas and they were ice cold!  I ordered the \"jumbo wings\" which turned out to be these tiny wings that looked like they came off pigeon not a chicken.  My wife's Italian bogie tasted like plastic, and my meatball consisted of overcooked meat.  When it comes down to it, I hate using calories on bad food and that's exactly what happened.  Foodies should stay away.  Its a shame, with their great location and some decent food, you could do really well."}
{"text":"I love everything that I have ever eaten at Burghs. Everything is delicious. My personal favorite is the pizza, it really is great. My recommendation? The 5 cheese pizza with sausage added to it is top notch. Yum!"}
{"text":"Got the thin crust pizza and the deep dish. Both were very good. We were just in Chicago over the weekend and ate at Geno's east while there. It is supposed to be the best deep dish pizza in chi town. It is sub par. Burgh's was way better with more favor throughout. The Windy City can learn a few things from the steel city.  Also the roasted wings were the best I ever had."}
{"text":"If you want to eat at Burgh's, come for the lunch buffet.  Wednesdays are especially good with a carving station set up with good turkey and ham, and of course the steady stream of pizza, wings and a surprisingly well-stocked salad bar.  It starts at 11:30 and can get quite hard to find a seat so arrive early.  If you can't make it for the buffet then expect to wait up to an hour for your lukewarm food.    We've come often enough for both lunch buffet and dinner that I feel pretty confident in my experience and the next time someone suggests eating there and it's not buffet time I'll politely, but firmly refuse."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent visitor of burghs for the past several years.  I've held business parties there as well brought large groups there for dinner. The food is always good but that's where any positives end.    Last night I brought a group of 10 people to Burghs.  They squeezed us into two tables that according to the hostess should seat 8 people.  Well, we had 10, not 8.  We were very cramped. I tried numerous times explaining this to the hostess who didn't seem to be interested in helping us.    We eventually got a third tablet added which gave us much more room.  For the next several minutes I noticed the staff talking about our party and giving us dirty looks.  I then asked to speak to the owner/manager who told me \"I'm not going to talk to you.\"  I can put up with their long waits to get a table.  I can put up with the ridiculous amount of time it takes to get your food once you order.  I can put up with the fair to poor service (with the exception on Toni at the bar who is consistently excellent).  But I cannot put up with complete apathy, rudeness, and disregard for customer service from the management and ownership.  I will never again step foot inside Burghs.  I will never again bring large gatherings of people there.  I will never again hold my business functions there as I have done in the past.  I will never again support their 5k as I have done for the past many years.    I'm sure me spending my money elsewhere really won't hurt their bottom line and I'm certain my money won't be missed.  What I am certain of is if the owners continue their apathetic attitudes, dont correct the long wait times for food, and dont train their staff on proper customer service then others will not be returning as well."}
{"text":"The staff is very rude. From the moment you walk in the staff seem very unhappy to have a customer. All around the food is good but nothing makes up for being treated like dirt. Epically when your giving them money."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best.  Wings are usually VERY greasy.  Pizza is subpar.  But more importantly, the wait staff is apathetic and unfriendly.  Since they rely on tips, would assume they'd at least 'fake' a smile.  Average food, below average service.  Try somewhere else if you can."}
{"text":"Thank Goodness for the free popcorn otherwise Burghs leaves much to be desired. Best consumed after several beers or a long night of partying - this food is not good sober. I've also heard complaints about people who work in the building refusing to eat there because they see how food is kept and how unclean the restaurant front and back. After today - I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"This is a difficult call to make, but I'm going with a strong 3 for Burgh's.   Being that this was a birthday meal for me (paid for by my darling Kay) and that Burgh's bar-food bill of fare was an intriguing read, we ordered a large early dinner, more than half of which was quite appetizing.   For example, Burgh's BIG Pretzels, which we had deep-fried, were astonishingly crisp yet fluffy, the tandem of liquid cheese and honey mustard (both made in-house) thrusting each dough knot into the stratosphere.   The honey garlic oven-roasted wings were thick with brittle skin and juicy, savory, sweet poultry. The wings were so delectable, we used the ranch dressing only for the celery and carrots, and that doesn't happen often.  Doman's Garlic Fries were a pile of \"O\" sticks gone gourmet, almost garishly so considering parmesan and parsely were involved. Cooked twice in hot fat, each tater stave was chip-crisp outside and mashed spud-soft inside. Somebody in that kitchen knows how to use a fryer like a samurai knows how to use a sword.   Things started faltering food-wise when the pizza and burger were finally trotted out. Perhaps the flawed pie was my fault in that I chose my toppings poorly. Considering my natal day, I went wild and asked for proscuitto, caramelized onions, and chopped clams on what Burgh's calls a \"Thin Deck Pizza.\" The slim crust is dusted with cornmeal and is supposedly baked on oven stones, in theory making for a crispy crust. Unfortunately, no crispness happened as the pizza itself was droopy. I felt the toppings went well together, but the crust just couldn't hold them properly. To boot, the sauce was close to nonexistent, and the mozzarella cheese was utterly tasteless.   The Avocado Burger was supposed to be medium-rare but was cooked to an almost arid medium (or was it well-done?). The bacon and vegetables slid off of the rubbery, slick, tragically unseasoned patty and out of the not-so-fresh bun, making this mundane burger a thankless chore to eat. The cole slaw that came with the burger was acceptable and little else.   Service was choppy on the day we visited despite the house not being full. A  harried middle-aged woman who was dressed somewhat provocatively for her age (painted-on leggings, a cleavage-baring sleeveless sweatshirt, and a backwards baseball cap) greeted us while reluctantly bussing tables, complaining to us about how busy the restaurant was. Was she the owner? I hope not.   Further down the path of ineptitude, our server made us feel somewhat rushed, and the food was slow to arrive at our table. Halfway through our meal, we were handed our check. When I mentioned that we might like dessert, I was curtly told that Burgh's doesn't offer any even though a brief dessert menu can be found on the restaurant's website.  I suppose that's what Labella Bean is there for. Stay tuned.   Burgh's has potential. Without the burger, pizza, and unprofessional staff, Burgh's would skip to a 5 star rating from my keyboard without much handwringing."}
{"text":"This is my third visit and I still was not impressed. I don't understand the long wait to get in. The food is only fair, no great bargain and the service leaves much to be desired.   My friend and I ordered wings and a pizza.  The first issue was that they say they are \"jumbo\" wings. The wings we recieved were by no means jumbo, in fact they could be considered petite. The garlic wings were totally overcooked (dry and crunchy). There was very little flavor to them, lots of grease on the bottom of the basket. The wings are sold in 5's and 10's, what happened to a dozen wings? There is a charge for blue cheese and celery, which was a very small portion. If you love food wings, go elsewhere.  The pizza was tasty, but also overcooked. My friend called it well done. It was not burnt, but was dark and very tough.  They charge $2.59 for a soft drink. Really?   I don't see what all the hype is about this place, but I don't see myself returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came here for pizza and wings on Friday night. We ordered a medium four cheese pizza and 15 wings half buffalo and half garlic parmesean. The restaurant is very casual. The wait for our food was longer than expected. Our pizza came out finally, but before our wings which was a bit weird. The wings were delicious! Nice and crispy, but still juicy. I really enjoyed the buffalo sauce. The pizza was good, but nothing special. The food is very reasonably priced. A decent place to satisfy the wings and pizza craving."}
{"text":"Food is excellent  One of the best Pizzas in the area.  Service can be a little slow.  If you are not a regular or townie you can be ignored when it is busy.  If employees were more friendly this would be 5 stars"}
{"text":"We were looking for a laid back venue to host our rehearsal dinner, and came across Burgh's Pizza & Wing Pub. The prices were affordable, and they provided PLENTY of food for our party- we had a lot of leftovers at the end of the night. We really appreciated that they never skimped on food towards the end of the evening. For our group of ~30, we had one dedicated staff member who worked hard to keep the food and drinks stocked (we were doing a buffet style dinner, so one person was more than enough). The booking process was also very easy- Dan was easily accessible and happy to take my calls on his cell phone when he wasn't working. If we ever had the need for another private party in the area, I would certainly consider booking with them again."}
{"text":"Stopped here early afternoon with my daughter, her husband, granddaughter and my hubs for a quick bite before we left them to head back home to Dayton.  We ate here once with them and the food was pretty good at that time but the service was really bad.  Gave them another chance but you know what they say about second chances.....We ordered the baby's meal before anything else so we could get it timely and keep her happy while we all ate.  We waited 40 minutes for ANYTHING to come out.  When part of our order did arrive, we received cold wings, cold cheese triangles and hot sausage stuffed peppers that were raw and cold (as in uncooked).  Sent those back and by the time they got those back out, everyone was done eating.  The waitress also explained that the peppers were not really \"raw\" because they are stuffed with lunch meat.  REALLY?  The menu describes these as stuffed with Italian sausage and cheese (which is typically how these are made). The food was terrible and the waitress did nothing to try to accommodate.  Things were so bad that my Son-in-law spoke with management and the owner basically did not care.  Pretty terrible experience.  We won't be back.  The place was pretty filthy today as well.  There are better choices in this neighborhood.  Don't waste your time unless you simply want to belly up to the bar and have a beer and watch a game."}
{"text":"I work and live near here, many co-workers get lunch or dinner here, I can only comment on takeout. Everyone says the same thing, the food quality is inconsistent, sometimes it's the best pizza in the area, sometimes it's pretty average. The first time I went there to pick up a take out order, I apparently went to the wrong bar and the waitress rolled her eyes at me and pointed in the other direction without saying a word, I guess this happens often enough that they should tell people where to go?   Otherwise, I've had worse, prices are about the same as anywhere else."}
{"text":"Worst hostess EVER!!!!! I can't even began to describe how rude she was! We were 2 families with 4 kids! We arrived and sign said \"please wait to be seated\".  We waited, and waited, and waited! 20 minutes pass... finally I set my stuff on a table right up front where kodys wheelchair fits PERFECT and the lady seats people there with an attitude. Says we need to put our name on the list. So we do! Obviously not to happy because we already waited 20 minutes. Then she rudely says it will be about 40 more minutes for table of 8. So people continue to get seated, she comes over to confirm name on the list and we complained and she literally just walked away! (Really) So I start talking to lady who put her name in after us and she said this lady is always ignorant that she can't believe she comes back. I ask for manager... no one ever gets me one. She comes back again after lots of whispers and stares and tells me it's going to be awhile there's also 4 other large groups ahead of ours if we want to leave! I look and we were moved to LAST on the list!!! I tried to take a pic of list to post and she snatched it! My husband finally got a manager and he stated hostess is doing the best she can. At this point we left! I will never allow my family to be treated like this! Please keep sharing no business should treat people like this!"}
{"text":"This is very hard. The food here was actually very good. Between the four of us, we got a prosciutto and arugula pizza, a veggie pizza, a pepperoni pizza, and a mushroom swiss burger (I know, fat right?)  All of the pizzas were awesome, and the burger tasted great (yes, we ate each others' food lol.)  Now comes the hard part. The service was eh...our server didn't know what kind of Gin they carried, and when one of us ordered a Blue Moon, she put it in, then came back and told us they don't serve Blue Moon there...wouldn't be a problem if that person in our party hadn't had Blue Moon every time she went there. Also, the place just had this \"unclean\" vibe going around...like sticky tables, dirty menus with food crusted onto them, a cook who was wearing gym shorts, and another server whose yellow soccer-looking t-shirt was basically just one giant grease stain. I tried very hard to ignore these things since the food really was very good...and I would've given Burgh's more stars had I not decided to use the restroom during this one fateful lunch....you see, when coming back from the restroom, one can see into the kitchen very well. What I saw was a little bit terrifying. The hotel pans (which are stainless steel) were literally black. I saw what looked like rotten vegetables and greens laying on the counter. I also noticed that the deep fryers had some gigantic, bulbous matter that had apparently poured down the front and sides and become caked on. It looked like piles of insulation foam, but was clearly some type of food debris. Now, mind you, this was simply what I saw from a 3.5 second glance whilst passing by...which makes me shudder to think of what I would find if I were looking for any longer. I do not proclaim to be a health inspector; however I have run nutritional departments and managed kitchens, and have been through countless inspections....this place would have been tagged as soon as an inspector walked in the door.  It honestly made me regret eating the food."}
{"text":"Eh. Not a fan. Always crowded with the suburban soccer type family. The food is nothing special, tastes like pre-packaged frozen crap thrown into a deep fryer. Service is poor. I don't say this over one or two visits, I say this after going there for years and hoping things would get better. Apparently the owners are ok with sub-par because they keep racking in the folks or either don't care or don't know any better."}
{"text":"The food is great BUT only if you can wait for it. A simple pizza and two hoagies took an hour... as usual. The dining room was half empty and there was no line in/out for take out.. sorry, no excuses. I love the place, location and beer selection...   I just dont love the looooooooong wait for food."}
{"text":"We were not noticed at out seats in the bar area, so we moved to the bar when seats became available. Then it took a bit too long to be addressed at the bar.   As soon as we were waited upon, everything was fine. Food was ok. Standard pub fare."}
