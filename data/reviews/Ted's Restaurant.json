{"text":"Cheap, tasty food served by friendly people in a quaint environment."}
{"text":"The best baked chicken I've ever had! I've been driving by Teds for years and just recently stopped in. The Grecian chicken is the best!"}
{"text":"This is a great local business to support. The staff is super nice and are more then willing to accommodate you. My husband and I occasionally stop in for bite. I love the friend chicken, fried squash and buttered rice. The meal comes with a soft, white, buttered roll. My husband always gets the super boy burger, which he loves. Ted's is definitely a greasy spoon restaurant, but perfect if you're in the mood for that. 

Sweet tea- Very sweet 
Fried squash- I call these golden nuggets of HEAVEN! Yes, they are that good! 
Desserts- They have a fridge of premade deserts e.g. baklava."}
{"text":"Ted's is NOWHERE NEAR Eastland.  It's a stone's throw from McAlpine Park and the train bridge on Monroe Rd.  That's about 8 miles  from Central Ave at Sharon Amity and shutdown forever Eastland Mall.  Don't say no to Teds thinking it is in the HOOD.  It is not.

If you like the big, greasy-delicious cheeseburger, hot fries, and sweet tea or soda,  Teds is a place you must visit once in your lifetime and their fare is far reaching including great combos, BBQ, salads, pitas, sandwiches, and desserts including eclairs and baklava all made fresh on site.  They sell tees and ball caps too if you want a souvenir.  Located between a small strip center of Latino businesses and a tattoo parlor.  Look for the big yellow sign.   Inexpensive and delicious. Great little place and well maintained.    Andale Andale....hurry."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that is reasonably priced has good food good desserts and sweet tea. I get there every now and then when I am out that way.  It is a little ways from South Charlotte and Park Road.  I always ask for the fried chicken cooked up fresh and they do it for that me every time.  I wait patiently and it comes out delicious every time. I cannot decide upon two or three of the desserts often times I will take two of them home one for one day and one for another. The guy behind the counter I believe his name is Gus,  I may be wrong however he is always pleasant works very hard does a good job and is always there. The ladies behind the counter work hard too,  keeping your glass full of tea.  I suggest when you're down near Munro Road going towards Matthews that you give it a try I don't believe you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"So we moved offices so goodbye Southend!! Hello Monroe :) !! We came into Ted's our first week at our new spot and have now made it over there at least twice a week! It's in a small shopping center but has been there forever! Walk up to the counter and order then take your seat and wait for it to be up ready! 

They have daily specials from a Grecian Chicken over Rice (get it with a Pita), Tenderloin Tips get a salad with Greek dressing sooo good, Chicken and Dumplings this is just to name a few. Ive had all of those but lately Ive been on a Gyro kick and let me just say that this is by far the best Gyro I've ever had!! I don't know what it is but the meat, the sauce, and the Pita make it all delicious!! 

The ladies behind the counter are super helpful and remember what you like no matter how many times you go in!"}
{"text":"This place has been around a very long time. I remember eating there in high school 35 years ago.

Unfortunately, not much of anything has changed. Heck, its pretty much the same menu as it was back then.

There is really nothing here that stands out at all. Most everything is bland. Most everything is on par with what you would get in the frozen food section at the grocery store.

Chicken, always dry. Veggies are terrible. I mean really bad. Fried squash, okra etc, are flavorless mush.

Every piece of fried food they sell tastes identical. Not like the food it is attempting to be, but like very old friar grease.

Interestingly, I see they still do some of the same 'charging for items', they did decades ago.

If its a takeout order, plan on paying more. Worse tho, is they don't disclose this when ordering.

Whether eating in or taking out, they give you very little of the condiments and sauces you need. You will most always need more and they charge for each one. If you've already paid via credit card and dont have any cash, they dont care and will literally make you put a .25cent charge on your card. But worse is depending on what your ordering, you may need several different types of sauces. So now your paying an extra $1-$2 for condiments they should be giving you enough of. I could maybe understand it if they gave you ample condiments to begin with, but they don't. 

If it does happen to be a take out order, you will get home and find you don't have nearly enough condiments and better hope you have some in your own fridge/pantry. If a takeout order and you know you will need more condiments, your already being charged more due to it to being a takeout order and after adding in additional costs for condiments, your now paying an awful lot of money for food that simply is not that good with some that is downright awful (fried squash/okra-just plan on it going straight in the trash).

Here is what I suggest. If your going to Teds,less then 5 minutes away is Crown Point Restaurant (rated #3 in Charlotte for Best Comfort Food) located on Sardis rd North, easily accessible from In. Blvd or Monroe Rd.

You can not even compare these two places. One is just like Grandmas Cooking. One is reminiscent of Hungry Man Frozen Dinners.

If you try CP, you will never wish to eat at Teds ever again. I only felt compelled to write this review cause its been awhile since I've eaten at Teds and figured I'd see if it had changed.

Nope. No need for me to try it again.

I will say that the folks that work there are always very nice and friendly, but if the food is sub par, no amount of friendly smiles will make it taste better."}
{"text":"Looking for a local greasy spoon in east Charlotte?  This place has slipped under the radar for some reason.

I used to go here on a regular basis when I worked nearby.  Ted's has been on Monroe Rd since the early 1980's.  The lunchtime is pretty busy and its nice to see blue and white collar workers mixing together.  The food is pretty good.  It's your typical Greek-owned-Southern-down-home-cooking place.  The lunch specials are around $6.  They have a superburger, which is decidedly American in its caloric value and bulk.      I love the gyros as well, they don't spare on the meat.  And the onion rings...HOMEMADE.

Their specialty is Grecian Chicken.  Its roasted and covered in an orange spice/sauce.  A little greasy...but its called a greasy spoon for a reason.  If you're on Monroe Rd. between Sardis and Idlewild, its not a bad stop for lunch.  Its near across the street from the Amish furniture store and down the street from the McAlpine Park.  And if you're a regular, the wait staff will likely learn your name."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Ted's. They are always friendly and the food is yummy. The superburger for my son, Grecian Chicken for the husband, and they have the best veggie wrap for me. Gus is great. If you're just driving by and not stopping,  you're missing out."}
{"text":"Go here often because of it's location, halfway between my job and Matthews.  Not the kind of place you'd go out of your way for, but it's perfect for what it is.  A small quick inexpensive diner for lunch.  It does have a walk-up order and plastic forks, but hey, it fits the bill for what I'm looking for.  Usually have meetings there too with people from Matthews and it's quiet enough for those and plenty of room to spread out paper work."}
{"text":"Ted's is like one of those diner's you can find in small towns, with the ever dependable \"regulars\" always there around lunch time. Let me paint you a picture; never-ending sweet tea, fried chicken with sides of green beans, potato salad, and okra, and of course big hamburgers. 

Their menu is fairly diverse what a Southern restaurant, their service is speedy, and you'll hardly ever pay more than ten bucks for a huge meal. However, the food is stuck somewhere in the middle of average and just ok. If I'm starving and want a cheap, quick meal in East Charlotte, I wouldn't hesitate to eat at Ted's. But when t comes to taste, it just isn't that great. I've ate there a couple of times and despite always feeling full, I never quite felt satisfied afterwards."}
{"text":"This place seems to have always been here. Just a nice little family place. They have some nice daily specials. Come check them out."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! Great place for a consistently good meal! I had an awesome chicken on pita! It is an affordable quick meal!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem. Fried flounder, mac and cheese and sweet tea make a great combination here."}
{"text":"The place has been in business for 44 years, and there's a good reason. The food was great, homemade and fresh. I had the hamburger steak. Generous portion with homemade gravy and grilled onions. I topped it off with a slice of sweet potato pie. I haven't had sweet 'tater pie in years!
It's located right next to McAlpine Grenway Park, host of the Footlocker SE Regional Xcountry meet. A great way to end the meet."}
{"text":"This is one of the few restaurants that I took 2 bites and threw it away. Didn't even ask for my money back I was so disgusted. I am not sure how this restaurant stays in business; every time I drive by it is empty."}
{"text":"This place is old school all the way...walk up order counter says it all...Linch was great and side options run the spectrum...glad I stopped in"}
{"text":"Best little place open till 9 best dumplings on Tuesdays and Meatloaf on Thursday's. 
  Super burger is the best in town. 
Special omelet not on the menu but really good. 
 Fried chicken best around, Grecian chicken seems to sell out all the time.
 Owner is a great person and very family orientated. As well as the staff this is the best gem in the area. 
 Hidden menu of Chicken ala gotcha and bacon,cheese omelettes outstanding. Don't forget the onions. 
 Nighttime could be faster on the service , days flies and is all over the refills and courtesy 
Ahh the best meatloaf for the best price in town!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Ted's! One of my fiance's old co workers told us to check out this restaurant. We really liked it!

The people have always been friendly, and the price is unbeatable. We actually haven't been in awhile, and funny how I brought up this place again today. I'm sure we'll be going back real soon!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Ted's for lunch, and when I say I used to go to Ted's for lunch, I mean something like a decade ago. Maybe even longer. Now I drive by Ted's and think \"I need to go back to Ted's\", which leads to the problem of getting to Ted's.

It isn't that the process is particularly hard, as you can pull in right off of Monroe. It is that they never seem to be open. They do not open for breakfast, which is when the perfect dive of a place would be open. They do not open much on weekends, which is when I typically find myself driving by. So you have to time it just right.

If you should happen by on those hours - generally lunch or dinner during the week, or like an hour on Saturday - then it is worth a visit. Probably nothing outstanding, but they are very friendly, have some good sweet tea and you can say you've been. But there is also very little that is really memorable, and you may find yourself wondering just what happened when you leave. Sort of like a Men in Black memory wiper."}
{"text":"Mediocrity at its finest.  Been in CLT for 13 years....thought I would give this place a try since I pass by it multiple times a week.

I got the hamburger steak with fried squash and slaw.  My bf got Fried shrimp and FF/onion rings.

It was edible....and memorable enough not to eat here again.    The hamburger steak was OK.  The squash was flavorless.  The batter was crispy and the squash was soggy on the inside.      

My BF said his shrimp was Ok at best.

After I was seated and waited on my food...I asked for a side of ranch to dip my squash in. I got really irritated when the waitress told me she would have to charge me.  So, not having any cash, I had to whip out my debit card to pay a $0.38 charge for some ranch.  I'm sorry, but a $20 dinner for 2 warrants a side of ranch and a side of tartar sauce for the shrimp.     If I were the waitress and saw someone pull out a debit to run a $0.38 charge....i believe I would say.....\"don't worry about it...its fine\".   She apologized and told us that she had gotten in trouble earlier in the day for not charging someone.  

The atmosphere is a bit nostalgic like a look back in time.  

Is the food edible?....I suppose.  Will I be back?.....I doubt it.  

If the owners were not so tight on the \"ranch fund\"....I might consider going back to try something else.

2 stars was being generous."}
{"text":"Maaaaaan....I really wanted to like Teds. I normally love places like this. You know the kind...been around ages, loads of regulars, staff that has probably worked there for 20 years..the kind of place where the owner knows your name.Maybe I have been spoiled by Louis's Grille or something because my first ( and probably going to be the last) visit to Teds was a bit of a let down. 
Now I do have to say that the staff was extremely friendly...but unfortunately the food disappointed.
I ordered the Grecian Chicken special with the greek salad and fried squash (one of my favorite things normally). Maybe I have never had a REAL greek salad in my life but I didn't understand why my salad was drenched in something that resembled and tasted like a bland ranch. Not a fan. Then the fried squash...not crispy and just mush on the inside. I am now officially convinced that thick cut fried squash is just a bad idea. The chicken itself wasn't bad but it didn't have that much flavor and the leg was pretty dry. I tried the chicken pita that my mom got, and was really excited about, and again...just ok.
I really went back and forth about whether to give this place 2 stars ( when my mom asked me what I thought about the food, I actually said \"Meh..\") or 3 stars because I do want to support a business that has been around this long. But ultimately it should be about the food shouldn't it? :/"}
{"text":"We used to live in Charlotte and I would go here often for the grecian chicken which is not available every day.  I still miss it and asked them for the recipe since I can't find anything like it where I now live.  But alas, no recipe for me.    Does anyone that knows their grecian chicken have a similar recipe I could try?   Thanks!"}
