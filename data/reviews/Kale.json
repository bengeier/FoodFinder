{"text":"Too bad this place shut down! I loved it when visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"YUMMMMM

Me and my company were walking down yonge, when I spotted this restaurant. I remember reading some positive reviews on yelp, so I decided to I wanted to eat here. 

There was a nice selection of food. We both got a little bit of everything. 
I love how everything was organic, vegan, and FRESH!..
We also ordered juice (i believe it was 1 and 9) and I wasn't all that into it, plus it was very expensive...to me.
*I did take pics, so I will post them up soon*

By the time, me and my company were done, we were satisfied. 
(my company who hates veggies LOVED it!!! which is HUGE)
  *I was thinking...uhh...who is this person? Did they put some crack in the food?* 


One of the best things that we loved is how we didn't overeat. 
You ever got that feeling when you eat in a buffet and by the time you are done, you feel disgustingly full...you know...belly hanging out and you feel like you can barely walk? (i've been there a couple of times, haha)


Overall, I would give it a 4/5
Can't wait to come back =)


note: I have been to Le Commensal and I have to admit, I kindof like this better though Le Commensal has a bit more selection. 
I heard that not everything at Le Commensal is fresh and plus it is a little more pricey, from what I remember."}
{"text":"Have never eaten the prepared foods. Can only vouch for the freshly squeezed juices.

YUM! Prices are a tad higher than most establishments. But i come back because they make the best kale / apple / lemon drink in the city!

My only complaint. - business hours are unconventional. They're not open at all on Sunday. And not until 11 on Saturdays. A fact i always seem to forget, until i land on their front doorstep facing the closed sign, left wailing \"Noooooooooooo!\" At which time i promptly making my way to the inferior Booster Juice nearby. 

Open earlier & on Sunday, PUH-LEEEEEEEASE for the love of good food and juice! You are a restaurant after all, weekends are prime time!

Lastly, web-site does not list hours. Kinda imp info. Update your site so web-savy masses can support your biz - one of the few healthy food ports in the city."}
{"text":"Was hopeful but disappointed in the end.  In 2013 it's not good enough to just be a vegetarian restaurant in Toronto, you also have to be good.  Add some flavor and perhaps a touch of creativity.  Vegan / vegetarian food doesn't have to be boring like when I was a kid."}
{"text":"Kale is great!

I've eaten at Kale a bunch of times and I've never had something that I didn't enjoy. I'm particularly fond of the leek pie, the pierogies, the hummus, the marinated tofu, and the many salads. Their baked goods are also really nice (and less heavy than traditional baked goods). And it's awesome that they change up their offerings all of the time. It's fun to walk in and find a bunch of new stuff to try.

Purely in terms of taste, variety and healthfulness, Kale is one of the best places in the city. (And, even more important than that, it's a 100% vegan place!)

The one obvious problem with Kale is that the prices are way, way too high. For a counter-service place that's cooking primarily from simple ingredients, there's really no justification for the price."}
{"text":"As a vegan, there are far more better places than this and far from their price.

The only reason why it's 1 stars cuz i liked their samosas and the services was good. Other than that, I paid about $25 for a lil box of salad and a brownie. That's just my damn dish. My friend got samosas, a lil box of salad and a drink, which came about the same as mine. He didn't get much in his lil box. Yes, it's by weight.

Regardless, It wasn't so extravagant where I'll make my way to there and eat from Kale. There are other places where I will travel near and far for, but this is one of those places I wouldn't. Food is ok and pricey as hell. Enough said."}
{"text":"Love having a vegan place close by, especially after a workout. The juices and smoothies are fresh and customizable (I added chia seeds and replaced the vanilla almond milk for unsweetened). But an $8 smoothie! Yikes. Food is priced by weight and it can add up very quickly. There are some nice salad  and soup options. I had the tofu burger with a cup of vegetable soup and a side of leafy greens. The soup  was great, fresh with nice flavour the burger was a disappointment, it very dry and not very interesting (from a flavour perspective). 

Good for basic healthy food but expensive."}
{"text":"I was super excited when a vegan place opened up in my old neighbourhood. And then I went there and excitement turned to super disappointment. I've been to Kale a few times now and am always left feeling like I should have gone elsewhere.

It's a serve yourself, pay by weight style restaurant. So you can't even say that you're paying for service, as there is none. They have very limited choices, and what they do have is super BORING. Rice noodles with some seaweed mixed in...steamed kale...stew...brown rice...a VERY basic green salad...YAWN.

And for these incredibly boring options that you've served to your self, you pay an insane amount! You're looking at 13-15$ for a plate with very little food on it - not even a full meal. RIDICULOUS."}
{"text":"Always really enjoy the food. It's quick and easy, and in a good location. The main problem is it is just very expensive!

If it were more affordable, I'd go all the time!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you want a quick bite of delicious home cooked vegan food. I liked the humus, different types of rice, and also the curry dishes. Be sure to try Ursula's Vegan brownies because they are out of this world. First you think \"vegan brownies can not be good\" then you take a bite and it instantly becomes your new dessert replacement. Enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"I understand why you might want to stop eating food in Toronto. Not for lack of delicious options. It's just really freaking expensive.

But. If you decide to go ahead and eat food while you visit / live in Toronto, Kale is a great macrobiotic buffet to visit to replenish those nutrients that get sucked out of you while walking through, say, a really large underground shopping center.

I love to color up a meal. It's way more fun to eat when your plate is also your palette!

Fill it up. Weigh it. Scale it. Maybe toss in a dessert. And pay. That's how it works.

Thanks, Kale."}
{"text":"The first time I came in here I was like, \"whoaaa attitude, lady. I'm serving myself here and you only have to ask if I'd like a juice. What's with the stink face? Are you getting enough B-12? I'm concerned about you.\"

But the other guy was terrifically nice and the food was wonderful.

The second time I came in here I was like, \"yaaaay, Screwface is nary to be seen! Instead this nice other lady is smiling at me! Yes, I WILL have a juice, thank you.\"

And the other guy was still there, still terrifically nice and the food was still wonderful.

Serve yourself at the hot/cold bar; it offers all organic, all vegan options, and fresh juice. The selections rotate often and it's usually difficult to contain your excitement about items. There's a beauty of a dessert/drink/take-away bounty at the cash register, including kombucha, coconut water and prepped sandwiches. 

Note: since you're paying for fresh, organic ingredients the price can be considered steep by some. A plate will cost about $10-$12 (although I managed to get mine to come under $7 last time!)"}
{"text":"I went to Kale for lunch. Most of their offering is a hot buffet you weigh by the pound. The food was good but I noticed most of the food was mixed with oil so not low cal. I don't know what the price per pound was, but for what I'd consider a medium sized lunch without a drink it was $19. Since the food is vegetarian, make sure you go for the beans and tofu. I must not have taken enough protein because I was hungry all afternoon!"}
{"text":"Thrilled to stumble across Kale today. Inexpensive, tasty and vegan. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food they have is quite boring and nothing I would call a restaurant.
Self serve isn't fun, but the tomato wrap which was prepared was good... except it looked very very old.
Not worth it to be honest."}
{"text":"Kale is a winner.

As Min Min T. notes, Kale is similar to Le Commensal in that it is a pay-by-weight buffet, but it really is a different experience.  The food is fresher and tastier, and the atmosphere is much more inviting.  Think: not a cafeteria.

I felt like a hearty lunch on this snowy afternoon, and I admit that I hesitated before deciding on Kale.  I was pleasantly surprised, not only because the food was excellent, but also because there were enough hearty options to leave me satisfied.  I was told that the menu changes daily, based on what organic produce is fresh and available.  That said, if they have pierogis, you should definitely try one.  The steamed Kale was also very good.  That may not sound like a culinary miracle, but I was very glad that it wasn't under- or over-done.

The friendly service is another strength.  I felt taken care of, even though Kale is a self-service buffet.

The food and service at Kale are very satisfying. The care comes through in every aspect of this restaurant, and it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Delicious and Healthy.   I've been several times and enjoy the large selection on the buffet line.  

Desserts are yummy, too.

I can only give them three stars because of the snotty service.   They aren't very friendly and I never feel like they value their customers."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Kale today. What a disappointment.  My friend and I opted for the buffet and I had a 16 oz juice. Grand total was $32. Are you kidding me? The food had no flavour. Not even dousing it in hot sauce could salvage the spinach and tofu blob of mush. 

Turnip stir fry - no flavour
quinoa salad, kale, grilled veggies - no flavour. 

The detox juice was good, but overpriced.

I would stay away from this place. I've been to other vegan places and they make delicious dishes. It isn't the food that is the problem. It is the way Kale has prepared it."}
{"text":"The only downside for me is Kale is not cheap.

That said...lunch...the buffet. I was sold when I walked through the door and could smell curried something (turned out to be potatoes). 

Grab a box and start filling; careful or before you know it you will have a $25 lunch...oops! That said I cannot complain about the food....I had a mushroom, tofu and leek bake. It was utterly delicious! Curried potatoes were a little 'sloppy' but tasted great. 

Everything was fresh; if it was meant to be hot it was!

Kale is small and airy.

Quinoa puff balls...divine!

Really enjoyed the food but the price will stop it from being a regular lunch haunt!"}
{"text":"I have recently really disciplined myself in changing my eating habits.  Working with a Dr, naturopath, I am taking proper vitamins and eating as clean as I can.

That being said... eating healthy is expensive no matter what, whether it is buying groceries or eating out.  I love the fact that Kale is right by my work and on days where I just feel blah, the food there makes me happy.

There are many options to choose from.  I have gone a total of 3-5 times and each time spent about $20, but I can't complain, I know I am getting fresh, whole foods, vs. fast food crap.

The location is clean and I have never rec'd any attitude from the staff, they have always been lovely.

Why 4 stars not 5?  It takes a lot to get to perfection, I have yet to find a place, but I am a fan of Kale :)"}
{"text":"I've now eaten at Kale Organic Eatery enough to say they consistently deliver delicious and quality vegan buffet-style food.

I wanted to update my review to mention how exceptional the vegan pierogies are in particular. My favourite ones are the squash and millet and the sweet potato and quinoa. They are garnished simply with sauteed white onion but have a really great flavour.

On my most recent visit, I picked up a bag of the tofu/potato pierogies frozen to try at home. They were more like the cheese/potato pierogies you get at Polish places but went well sauteed in olive oil and onions with some tofutti sour creem.

Other fab dishes are the asian noodle salad, the roasted potatoes, the bean stew, the greek tofu salad, the artichoke casserole and I'm a big fan of squash millet puree (the thing on the left in my photo).

Some of the blander items that I always get for health purposes are the tofu slab, the steamed kale and broccoli and the beets. It would be great if they marinated the tofu before grilling it and dressed the veggies lightly. I think it would make it more appealing to the palate of the average, vegetable-starved North American.

The prices are still towards the steeper end, like any pay-by-weight place but most things are organic so I take that into consideration. A plate of food from the buffet usually costs me between $12-$15. 

Luckily, I have the Toronto Vegetarian Association Discount card, which saves me 10% off my meal. :)

The place is always clean and bright and I love that I get table service of cutlery, napkin and water even when I'm just doing the buffet thing. The staff have always been very nice to me too. 

They also have a made-to-order menu that I've yet to try with veggie burgers and wraps. Who am I kidding though? I can't resist this buffet."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's my go to place when I need something to eat around Yonge and Eglington! Their chocolate mousse is to die for and I love the buffet style.  The place is simple and unique and great for a quick lunch during a busy day!"}
{"text":"I decided to go there because I had a coupon and because I read the food was decent.
So with coupon in hand and hubby with me we went. I had heard it had a smaller selection of food than le commensal but that the quality was better.

I would agree the quality is better than le commensal.  I liked that they had some things off the buffet you could order like a veggie burger.  But just to try it out, I took from the salad bar.  Since it is by weight and I am grateful I have a coupon because most things are heavy.  Sweet potatoes, potatoes, squash in millet, advocado, leek in vegan so tofu quiche.  Anyhow, it was good..kale of course.   Some reviewers called it boring.  I would say, it is lightly spiced or I'd call it more clean tasting food.  Nothing is hiding behind the spices. Toronto is a bit over the top when it comes to spicing whether it's for indian or thai food.  This is not that kind of place.  

I think it's a great place if you're trying to eat well and healty.  I like that there is a juice bar though I didn't have any.  It is pricey but if you can afford it, it's a healthier way to eat.  

We did try the day old muffins which I figured might be dry because they were made with tofu. I could eat them as they reminded me of other vegan baked goods I have had but hubby couldn't.  He likes the way I bake vegan better. :)  

I would be curious to try their soups next time but it was a warm day and I didn't feel like soup."}
{"text":"This place is so good. It's small and clean and the staff are friendly. The food is delicious and more important, totally nutritious. You pick your food from a hot and cold buffet, which is great because you can take as much or as little as you like. It's then weighed, and this is the only downside, it's pretty expensive, but definitely worth it once in a while. Yum yum."}
{"text":"It is vegan and it is organic, however the food is quite bland and pricey. The are brownish vegetable pulses, undefined tofu lasagna, steamed vegetables, roasted potatoes, some blanched chewy kale. I tasted few dishes and filled my plate, my elder daughter had a plate maybe 1/3 full and my little one chose only few broccoli and few potatoes. This came to about 30$ with 2 juices.
Dessert was also not impressive, apple turnover from the fridge was ok, it would have been nice if they offered to re-heat. Chocolate mousse extremely rich, good taste, too strong and too rich for my 10 years old to finish. The gluten free cupcake my other daughter chose had a grainy frosting probably made with nuts not completely blended. The cupcake texture was powdery due to being - my guess - made with only rice flour or a disprortionate amount of such flour.  The 3 desserts with 1 cup of coffee came to 15$.
When I paid I was told they would have weighted the dishes after the meal and reimbursed me for that weight...but they did not mentioned it when they took the empty plates. Besides, the dishes are all the same, shouldn't they just deduct a predefined weight if you decide to eat there?
All in all, not. Impressive, I will not be back. Definitely if you have non vegan friends in your party do not take them here because they will get the wrong impression of how wonderfully tantalizing and delicious our food can be.
The location is good, the place is clean and the girls are very pleasant: to girls of Kale...you have room for improvement, which is a wonderful journey!"}
{"text":"I had my first vegan experience here, and I'm so glad I did: I had a little bit of everything (you pay by weight), and I wasn't disappointed (I really enjoyed the sweet potato perogies!) I added the banana almond smoothie to my plate and, MAN, is it good!"}
{"text":"I'm so upset to give this place a negative review but I was very disappointed with my experience at Kale. I've had multiple friends recommend this place to me & quite frankly I have no idea why. 

On a positive note the place seemed very clean & tidy. The atmosphere was like a fancy, high end fast food joint. Very bright & open. They have a menu & an open food bar where the food is priced by weight. I opted for the open food bar because the food looked delicious. I got a rice noodle seaweed dish, shepherds pie & the kale. I just picked up a snack container to tied me over till my lunch plans. I am so happy I didn't get more then that! First off that little bit of food came up to $8, secondly the food was pretty bad. The kale had no flavour, the shepherds pie had flavour but sadly it wasn't a very good one & the rice noodle seaweed dish was the same. I've eaten at oodles of places around the city that have gluten free, vegan food & everything single one was better then the meal here. Between the taste & the price I'd recommend going elsewhere. Plus the staff was not the friendliest."}
{"text":"In less than 6 months, three new vegan/vegetarian restaurants have opened up in Toronto.  Kale, located just 5 minutes north of Eglinton, definitely helps make uptown more friendly for herbivores.

Similar to Le Commensal near the Eaton Centre, Kale also serves their food buffet-style, for $2.40/100 grams. Aside from that minor detail, Kale distinguishes itself from Le Commensal in every other way. The food here is entirely organic, vegan and homemade by a small family that runs it. Their selection, although a lot smaller, is made from scratch and you can taste the ingredients, which isn't masked by excessive salt or heavy sauces.

The seating here is limited, with only about 6 tables or so. The sleek interior and minimalistic decor makes it feel chic, a far cry from their flagship store, the miniscule and rather uncomfortable food bar, stuffed inside the back corner of the Noah's Natural Foods at Spadina and Bloor. 

The buffet bar is split into hot and cold items. A regular-sized plate will cost approximately $10; while the price seems a bit much for the amount of food you're getting, remember that you're paying for quality of ingredients. It's no more expensive than eating at the Spadina location; at least you won't be sitting elbow-to-elbow on a shaky wooden barstool staring at a blank wall, with your winter jacket hanging awkardly in your lap.

Regulars of the original location will be happy to see their favourites here too. The roasted sweet potatoes are absolutely delectable and the tofu stirfried with tumeric and cabbage was great too. As well, there was brown rice and fresh, leafy kale. To top it off, the daughter of the owners offered us a free bowl of tomato-and-dill soup to us for free - being Friday evening, it was the end of the day and her alternative option was to chuck it out. 

As for drinks, go for juice mixes that are listed on the menu; if you decide to choose-your-own, you'll find yourself paying $8-10 for a glass.

A quiet eatery to have a healthy meal and served by people who put heart into their food."}
{"text":"Kale is one place I realllly wish I got to go more often. The atmosphere is clean and quiet, and I do like that it's a 'weigh your plate' place. It's an awesome place to stop in for a quick healthy meal.

They always have a bunch of options, and I've never tried something I didn't like. I haven't picked up any of their refrigerated items for pick up (pita wraps and such) but from what I've heard, they're really good too. It's neat that there is a place like this that you can get salads (green based and bean based), stews, noodle dishes, the best hummus you'll find out there, as well as things like perogies. 

The only reason I don't go more often is just that it's pretty pricey. But otherwise I really like it, and I look forward to the next time I go!"}
{"text":"ya...it's still a one!  I've gone back a few more times just to see if the selection or anything has improved. But sadly a small meal will still cost you $15-$20 (pay by weight) and  you will receive bland under seasoned limited options! 
I want NOTHING more than an awesome or even mediocre vegan/veg restaurant in my hood, but sadly this is not it."}
{"text":"I visit Kale 2-3 times a week with good reason(s).

1) Vegan, organic, and healthy. Not a lot (any?) of places that can say the same thing in that neighbourhood. 
2) The food is good. Not complex flavours, but tasty. If it wasn't good I wouldn't go here 40-60% of the work week. It's buffet-style (by the weight) and there is Kale there every day (get the tofu dressing on it).
3) It's nice in there. Doesn't feel like a cafeteria or buffet place. Bright, pleasant, and really nice staff.
4) Desserts. Holy hell...vegan, organic desserts. Some gluten-free. So good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants at Yonge and Eglinton. If you are looking for healthy and nutritious meal with good alternatives Kale is the one for you. 

I agree with most reviews that food could get expensive. Since food from their hot and cold table is priced by weight it could add up pretty quickly. My very first time there I paid around $18 for my dinner with no drinks. My second time at Kale was for a lunch which cost me around $26 with a freshly prepared fruit juice. That being said there are hardly any restaurants that offer healthy, non greasy, vegan and organic food. Keep in mind though I am a foodie who likes to try everything. Hence, I filled up my plate with about 10-14 different items from the buffet table. 

I always visit this restaurant when I am at Yonge and Eglinton area.

My advice: Visit this restaurant and enjoy the healthy, non greasy, vegan and organic food."}
{"text":"Staff was really unfriendly when I went today- I don't know why. Possibly they aren't paid enough for all that they do. In any case, the food was tasty and different but a drink, dessert and a small plate of food came to a whopping $19! I couldn't believe it. Especially now that their competition (Fresh) just moved down the road. It's ridiculous pricing. The place itself was open and clean with little decor; kind of reminded one of a graceful cafeteria. 

 I would return if the staff didn't appear so sad and angry. It's sad that we don't understand that staff not being happy where they work = bad customer service=less profits. I wish more small business's in Toronto would realize this. Every time I go to Kale, I feel like I am adding more work to whomever is on cash."}
{"text":"I really like Kale.  It is expensive for a quick lunch in a cafeteria setting but the quality of the food is excellent. and infinitely more healthy than most of the the options that surround it. The buffet is large and every option I've liked."}
