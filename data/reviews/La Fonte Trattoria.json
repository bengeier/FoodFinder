{"text":"Homemade Italian food.  Very large hot table with a lot of selections.  We come here for lunch once or sometimes twice a week.  I always see the same faces, so you know people enjoy the food.  They also cater and hold parties.  We decided to have our baptism here, and this is where the kitchen really shines.  Excellent 5 course meal for our guests."}
{"text":"While smaller than some of the bigger, more popular places, I feel this is one of the best hot tables for lunch in Vaughan.   Slow cooked porchetta is killer!  Pastas change daily (I like the lasagna and anything with their bolognese sauce).

I'd give it 5 stars if they would have a better selection for desert. Throw some canolis on the menu and would be a 5."}
{"text":"I had the chicken breast for lunch last week, and it was probably the most tender piece of chicken I have ever had. The focaccia is so bang on, you will think your nonna is in the kitchen making it for them.

I also had the (MASSIVE) stuffed mushroom and that itself was enough for an entire meal."}
{"text":"La Fonte is the true definition of a hidden gem.  I've been working around the corner for years now and didn't even know this place was here.  I'm not sure how it slipped through the cracks but im glad I discovered it.  I don't buy my lunch often when im at work but sometimes I have no choice.  Up until now its always been fast food and I always wished I could get some fresh home cooked style lunches.  Well the answer to my prayers was right under my nose and I didn't even know it.  This is not your typical hot table.  Its a hot table on steroids.  I have never seen so much selection.  Pasta, meat, fish, veggies, salads, sandwiches.  Takes me longer to decide what I want then it does to actually eat the food.  Service is great but please please arrive early and be patient.  It can get very busy."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant by accident and now eat there 3 times a week. The porchetta is unbelievable. If they have homage sausage you won't be disappointed. Can get very busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing food that feels likes it straight out of Nona's kitchen. Somehow they manage to combine cafeteria style ordering with a seated service restaurant seamlessly. 
Clean inside with friendly service. The owner was serving customers and was so pleasant. 
It was my first time and I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is a hidden little gem very close to the Woodbridge Italy! 

It's set up as a traditional Italian hot table only but the food!!! OMG!! It was all delicious! I had the house prepared magic animal (Pork) that was delicious & oh so tender! It came with meat penne & a small side broccoli. This was just a start of the very wide selection of great food! You could tell that everything was prepared with care & appreciation for their customers. 

While serving us a Cappuccino...the delightful waitress took care, was polite & seemed to really care for their customers. 

This is a definite \"do-over\" for sure!! Ya gotta go."}
