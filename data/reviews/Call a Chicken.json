{"text":"Very flavourful and tender chicken, yet non greasy. I love the packaging and the bag it comes in. Customer service is very good, the staff explained the combo deals very well. 
I hope they will grow into a franchise one day. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"So far the best chicken sandwich ever!!! The meat is so juicy and tasty. So satisfying. I'll have to try other stuff from this place :)"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from this food court chicken stall. I wanted something quick and to-go so chose to get their chicken sandwich. And though it was $9 with tax (so a bit on the pricier side) I still wasn't holding out hope that it would be any better than a McChicken sandwich. Boy was I wrong! 
- There was a huge slab of chicken in the sandwich. And it didnt taste \"fake\" or like it had a lot of \"filler\". This was a whole piece of genuine fried chicken as a sandwich. And the chicken tasted good - the coating was perfectly breaded and not too thick or overpowering; the chicken itself was cooked well so it \"glistened\" on the inside.
- The bun was a bit overwhelming at first since it was huge. But it tasted really more like soft bread than a typical burger or sandwich bun so was good enough to eat and complemented the chicken well.
- The mayo and lettuce were minimal, which was fine so it didn't detract from the chicken itself.

A pleasantly surprising great chicken sandwich. Will definitely go back sometime to try their other meals."}
