{"text":"Just checking in-placed order, stay tune for update. It seems fresh food, very busy take out place.  Everything was delicious, best fry kabab."}
{"text":"Delicious! True Karachites (or not) will truly enjoy the good quality food. Totally mouthwatering and worth the wait."}
{"text":"If you love Kabab's, this place is for you. They serve an assortment of delicious kababs from bihari to seekh to dhaaga. Also some unique keemas and sandwiches. Really liked the Karachi paratha.   I highly recommend calling in your order ahead of time or the wait is approximately 30 minutes with no appetizers available. Dine in space is really tight with high chairs but low height tables, made the experience uncomfortable for me when eating as I was bent over. Probably best for take out.   I think we met the owner and he was really nice and service was friendly. Always a big factor for me.   Three stars only because the food didn't wow me but it was good. The chairs really made it hard for me to eat comfortably."}
{"text":"Overly priced, for the serving size, and taste. 3 stars mainly for the Management's service levels, otherwise overrated. We ordered tandoori chicken rolls, dhaga kababs, fried kababs, and bihari, along with fried poori parathas. Dhaga kabab was the only worthy item on the order. They don't know what a bihari kabab is, plus the serving size was just 4 pieces, not even half a plate for a single person. Fried kababs were not what they should have been, and they certainly do not have onions. The real ones are just dhaga kebabs fried in butter, and add yogurt (optional). The garlic mayo tandoori kabab rolls were a very sad story on the order .. tasteless and crazily priced for a dine in too (if they had the dine in option). At max, I might only go back for their dhaga kebabs, but then it could be that one off day."}
{"text":"Seriously good kebabs - we ordered the Chapli kebabs- they were amazing - and the Dhaka kebabs - these we full of flavour and spicy but a tad too high on salt.. they make these fresh so wither order ahead or be prepared To wait- we wanted to try The chargha too but they ran out- and even if they hadn't - the 40 min wait was not happening! Though if that is as good as the kebabs then I might just come ba k and wait!   Still have lots to try on the menu but glad to see that good quality Karachi style bbq is available!"}
{"text":"The kabab platter was really good. You could tell the meat was of good quality and the Karachi Paratha that came with the order were more than enoigh. Good food & good customer service"}
{"text":"This is authentic karachi style BBQ.  I could compare the dhaga kabab with ghufaar bhai kabab (At port grand Karachi). Paratha was amazing. I ordered BBQ boti platter which is available on website.  Everything was good and had the right Pakistani flavour.  Prices are also reasonable. Behari kabab was also full of flavours. Front desk staff was helpful when we were deciding on menu and guided us.  They have a nice beautiful park behind the shop so we decided to kill time by taking a 30 minute walk while they were preparing the food."}
{"text":"I grew up in Karachi and I am very familiar with it's food scene. We have \"Roll\" shops there which serve BBQd kababs in fried bread(Parathas/Puri). While I have seen a few Pakistani restaurants carrying rolls, none of them have been able to do it justice except these guys. Their Chicken Garlic Mayo (Malai boti) and Bihari Kabab Roll tastes EXACTLY the same as it would taste from a street shop in Karachi's small neighborhoods. We have tried some of their Tawa masala offerings as well and nothing has been anything less than amazing.  This is a Take-away only place with a few seats to sit down and wait. Order takes about 20-35 minutes to get ready, the owner is a nice guy usually gives a correct ETA.  I have traveled from Ajax to Missisauga just to have these rolls, thats how good they are."}
{"text":"Went here for the first and food is amazing. Small place take-out only we got bunch of stuff but kebobs were the best."}
