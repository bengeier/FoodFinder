{"text":"5 star shawarma place, excellent, friendly service, delicious food and reasonable prices. All the haters have no idea what they are talking about - look below at the person from Frankfurt Germany who reviewed this place...seems legit. I have been here dozens of times this year (looks like it lasted longer than 6 months, MEL) and it's always been quality. Don't believe me if you don't want to. Less lineup at lunchtime for me. HABIBI IS THE MAN"}
{"text":"These reviews are overhyped.   The shawarma wrap here is ok at best - the only reason I give it three stars is because the owners are friendly and ingredients were fresh.  I'm a five minute walk to this place but I doubt I'll ever be going back - very disappointing.   Go to Druxy's on liberty and Fraser instead"}
{"text":"Yah habibti. Super friendly owners. They always fill the shawarma plate full of chicken and all the extra toppings to the point that its overflowing out of the container. Liberty Village staple!"}
{"text":"Habibi has been open for about 4 weeks now. After the old shawarma place here closed, I was a bit surprised that this place would open as another shawarma joint, but I was thinking: \"Hey..maybe they can make it work!\".  I don't think that anymore. I am giving Habibi 6 months max.  I went there yesterday to pick up a chicken shawarma for lunch and I was disappointed.  The place is a hole in the wall and looks run-down.  They have basically no interior to speak of - 2 lonely plastic tables and a total of 4 chairs in the back. Plus a fridge for drinks.  After seeing their brandnew red store sign outside, I had expected more.  As for the food: They serve the typical shawarma fare, but also offer a few more \"exotic\" options like shrimp or tuna shawarma .  I stuck with the chicken shawarma since I felt that was a safe bet.  Well, it was not totally horrible, but it wasn't great either. The chicken was sparse.  I found a wilted lettuce piece inside.  The tahini sauce - I am still not sure if I was really able to locate it.   At least it was fairly cheap.  The price for a chicken shawarma is $4.29 plus tax which comes out under $5.  The other shawarmas are around the same price range. But following Ali Baba's idea of having a daily specials, they offer a different shawarma or sandwich each day for a reduced price, so you have the option to save some money.  If I am really hungry, I might come back to try the falafel sandwich one day.  But other than that I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is okay...had the chicken shawarma platter, which was really dry. She cut the meat and heated it up on the pan which made it really dry.   Good sauces and the ingredients seem fresh, so that's good."}
{"text":"This is the best shawarma in town.  I usually get the chicken shawarma plate and it's massive.  Very tasty.  Service always friendly."}
{"text":"I personally go here all the time. The owner is super friendly and the food is amazing!!! I don't normally give reviews but I'll make an exception for Habibi. The location is ghetto but this is by far the best Shawarma joint in the city!!"}
{"text":"The food was great.  I actually didn't expect that much as the place could use some updating.  The service was super nice.  The place looked clean.  It's just older, nothing spectacular.  Very casual atmosphere.   But if you are just looking for good tasting food, this is the place to go.  The flavours were great.  My chicken was hot.   The food tasted fresh.  I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Edit: I've lowered my review to a \"3\" because their prices keep going up and up. It was already too expensive in 2015 when I first went. Now it's just off my radar.  * * *  Service wise, they are very friendly. Order ahead and specify any exceptions clearly (no onions in salad, no hot sauce, extra hummus, etc) and I haven't had any errors  The food itself? It is pretty good but depends what you get....  - The shawarma dinner plate is really good. It is usually what I get. The garlic paste is overpowering, but it usually is. Sometimes I say 'skip the garlic and just put extra hummus'  - The shawarma wraps are pretty good, although nothing I haven't had at most other places.   - The gyro is good but it's just the beef shawarma meat cut into rectangles rather than slivers  - The fries are generic and bland. Avoid them. The first time I went I got the wrap combo with fries and a drink and I regret it... I had to add a lot of salt, pepper, ketchup etc to give them any flavour and even still they were bland. I think if they used a nice battered french fry, they'd be way better off.  - The rice? Quite tasty. A good compliment to the overall dinner plate, and nicely flavoured  Value? It's not great. They increase their prices every 6 months or so and I'm already price-conscious. What was $8.50 when I first went is now $10.25, and I didn't think it was worth $8.50 in the first place.  At the very least, the owner really feels like he wants your business. He seems like a kind guy who does what he does with pride. I only wish the prices were lower."}
{"text":"Worth going to twice!   For work in the area we did.  Recommended by a coworker from out of town.    Fresh ingredients as you walk in and friendly customer service. Falafel made before your eyes... noms   Pita is wrapped to perfection.  Certainly a hidden jem in a very questionable neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I love this place! Not only is the food amazing, you get quite a lot for the price. I always order the chicken shawarma plate and the meat comes out juicy and tender all the time, never over cooked or too dry. The owners are super sweet and service is always top notched."}
{"text":"I couldn't carry the plate to the table as it was that heavy.   Huge portion of seasoned Gyros with salad, tabouli and hummus.  Careful with the garlic sauce as it is potent.  The owner came to Canada in the 1980s from Lebanon and his place has been a mecca for locals.  Honest, homemade middle eastern food that is fresh and flavourful.  He has the yogurt beverage for those that want to complete the authenticity."}
{"text":"Came in at 9:30pm and there was only one person working the order counter. She was really nice!   Beef shawarma plate - comes with seasoned rice, onions, pickled turnip, tabouli salad, cucumbers, tomatoes, beef -- added hot sauce and yogurt -- SO GOOD! and my to go container was brimming. Large order of fries that she made fresh - but she forgot my ketchup BUT she gave me free pita bread! Falalel wrap was huge!  Super cheap, big portions, really tasty! Has free WiFi. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Shawarma sandwich offers more toppings than a traditional Lebanese shawarma but they've got the two most important things down: they have the right pickled turnip and garlic spread - not a water downed sauce like others. Chicken was better seasoned than half the places out there, but I would have preferred it sliced straight from the spit. Instead they slice it off and then cut it up on the grill which isn't the authentic way to present it but not a deal breaker. Turns out the owner is Lebanese but it was someone else serving me at the time.   The hummus had a bit too much lemon but had a great non-canned texture.   Veggie samosa could have had more veggies but the dough was really good.   Note to all: tahini is reserved for beef shawarma not chicken."}
{"text":"The owner is super friendly and the food is very good deserve 5 star"}
{"text":"Service is great, you'll meet the owner who works everyday. The serving portions are amazing and the best part are their prices. The price is very competitive and way cheaper than Liberty Shawarma which is just a few blocks away. It's worth a visit for sure, your wallet will not feel dented."}
{"text":"I don't agree with the previous review. Habibi is not a hole in the wall. The interior is quite updated and clean and his equipment looks new. The owner is awesome, all smiles, conversational and all the ingredients are fresh. He may in MMU honest opinion make the best shawarma and samosa in the city! 6.99 combo is more affordable than most fast food chains and the ingredients are very fresh. Parkdale has many hidden gems but this restaurant is a diamond in the rough. Eat here once and tell me I'm wrong!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, and a good price for a decent sized chicken shawarma. Also a good price if you want a side and a drink."}
{"text":"I don't understand why there are so many 5 star reviews, the meat is good but you barely get any, you get a tone of rice and it's not lentil rice with onions and stuff it's, like barely seasoned white rice, then you get a very little amount to sauce on each corner of the plate and then abunch of cheap lettuce, worst shawarma Iv had in a while, owner seems like nice person, jo daily specials, honestly over price for rice and raw vegetables with a little rice"}
