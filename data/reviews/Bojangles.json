{"text":"Restaurant used to be great but now seems like everytime I go the person in the drive thru is rude. They act like I'm bothering them. Ordered a 8 piece with 4 biscuits. Typically the chicken is large and cooked perfectly. This time the chicken was horrible. It was way over cooked and the pieces of chicken were super tiny. The thighs were smaller than the biscuits. The legs were super small as well. I read another review that he saw them throw already cooked food back in the fryer for a drive thru order. Maybe that's what happened with us. People just don't care anymore about what they are giving their customer.  We won't be back to this restaurant. Bojangles in Harrisburg or the one on 601 is much better. I posted a picture of our chicken so you can see I'm not exaggerating with my review."}
{"text":"I love this spot, the chicken is great, the biscuits are tasty, and they have the best macaroni and cheese!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a Bojangles that served bland chicken until I came to this location.  It was so bad I tossed the rest in the trash.  The service is slow and the customer service is mediocre at best.  I will visit other locations, but I'm done with this one."}
{"text":"The restaurant is dirty. Staff was rude. Food even looks dirty. If you value your health dont stop here."}
{"text":"Fastest drive thru service I've had; friendly personalities and good-quality food make this place a good visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We stop for breakfast very frequently at this location,  and while the usual service is ok, it's normally only noteworthy because of the frequency of the errors filling our order,  or the poor quality of the food that seems to have waited so long for us to arrive. This morning (and last Friday as well - I was afraid if I said anything I would jinx things) the crew was FRIENDLY, FAST, polite and the food was great! In addition, our order was filled exactly as requested and we spent so little time at the window I was almost afraid to look in the bag, y'know?

Anyway, the crew at Bojangles #924 in Indian Land (opposite the QT) was da BOMB today!  Not that I don't appreciate  everyone who works so hard there,  but the 6:15am crew today had everything under control and made stopping to get breakfast a genuine pleasure, any way you look at it! I wish the same folks were working every day when we stopped since the service AND food were both so awesomely good, lol! 

This obviously motivated crew definitely needs a RAISE and they should also be training all the new employees since they have a perfect understanding of what the term, \"Customer service,\" really means!

Thanks so much y'all! I really appreciate y'all making breakfast for my family and serving it up so fast and friendly!  You can be sure we will be back and we look forward to seeing your smiling faces again, soon!!"}
{"text":"First five visits I only received 1 wing TOTAL...all 5 times combined in five 8 piece combos. They always replaced the wings in 8 piece boxes with thighs. By the way, don't bother ordering cole slaw...they don't have it available for sale. I called corporate and explained THEIR issue. They asked me to wait a bit and try them again. I did......NO cole slaw. A month or so later I ordered two ham and egg bisquits and a sausage and egg too. Five minutes later I opened the wrapper at home and the amount of the egg on the bread looked akin to a cheese slice in thickness, only not so big around. By the way, we had to toss the bottom part of the bisquit...it was too stale and hard to chew. The ham was corn cob dry but the cat liked it. This is a nice new building but sadly with lazy cheapskates inside. They offer only lip service. Perhaps they really work for a competitor! They have forever lost an excellent local customer here. Most would have surrendered long before I did. Maybe the Canadians will stop on the way to MB."}
{"text":"I usually love bojangles. I took my 95 year old grandmother here. They were rude to us while taking our order and while cashing us out and didn't give us the utensils or straws we needed to eat and drink our to go order. I will never return to this location again. The location right up the road provides far better customer service and is worth the extra 2 minutes driving."}
{"text":"Terrible experience... Went through the drive thru to pickup dinner for my family... I ordered a12 piece tailgate meal that comes with 3 sides... First I was told they were out of legs would I be alright with extra thighs so I said sure then I was asked for my sides... I asked for slaw, taters and gravy and Mac and cheese then I was told Mac and cheese will be 20 minutes and would I like to wait so I just asked for rice instead... After I got to the window I was told it would be 10 more minutes on chicken PULL UP PLEASE so I did... After I got the food I started home looking at my order and a side was missing... So I turn around to get it and they give it to me no problem but by this time I so aggravated I just wanna get home... When I finally get home I open the box and its 6 legs 2 breast 8 pieces so I call up there and ask to speak to the manager and I told her the whole deal and was told they were training a new girl and that they were sorry for the mix up... I asked if there was anything they could do to fix the problem and was told they were very busy and she hung up on me... Next time I'll spend my 30 bucks elsewhere..."}
{"text":"I like Bojangles and the food at even this one is fine, however the customer service sucks you have to go in to make sure you get a correct order. If you go though the drive thru its wrong 90% of the time the other 10% they pour tea in your lap and give you one napkin to clean it up."}
{"text":"Overall pretty awful experience. In the day the service is usually poor and the people are rood with long wait times. However it gets much worse at night and the woman that made my food did not wash her hands or put on gloves after she had finished mopping the floor!"}
{"text":"visit today ~5:20....out of biscuits.  Wait 5 minutes?  It's always something with these people."}
{"text":"I will never return to this Bojangles.  My biscuit was like a rock.  The barbecue sandwich my mom had was nothing but globs of fat.  The fries were cold.  The service was extremely slow.  If you live in Concord and crave Bojangles,  choose a different location."}
{"text":"Tasty, southern fried chicken goodness.  About what you would expect from a fast food fried chicken joint --- the biscuits were tasty and the chicken was crisp and the sweet tea was great as well.

Nothing healthy about this place, but still good."}
{"text":"This is a decent Bojangles, however, for the third time getting takeout, they have forgotten the biscuit. Not worth going back for, but, it's getting old when you don't get what you order."}
{"text":"Worst Bo's ever. Staff not trained. Always a long wait. Staff not friendly, and could not care less about customers. Even their biscuits are bad!!  Why would you mess with that recipe?  Are they trying to cut corners?  Drive-thru ALWAYS a nightmare. Orders not filled correctly. Nuthouse. Will not come back until the sign out front says, 'Under New Management'!"}
{"text":"Great Bojangles. I've eaten at plenty in the Charlotte and Fort Mill area and this is the cleanest and has some of the nicest employees."}
{"text":"I just tried one of your fish sandwiches and is was almost inedible. The fish patty was 1/8 of an inch thick and burned on both sides. I think you guys need to stick to chicken"}
{"text":"Bojangles', thankfully, is very consistent, no matter which one you go to. I stopped in here on a early Monday morning (6 AM) & was surprised there wasn't any \"commuter traffic\" here.

I got my usual steak biscuit combo (with bo rounds & sweet tea). The employee over the drive-thru speaker was friendly.  

The biscuit & steak were cooked perfectly & wasn't burnt.  The bo rounds were cooked nicely, as well.

The prices are reasonable, too, which I love!"}
{"text":"Yikes.  This place is a disaster.  3 customers total and they couldn't figure out orders.  Teenage cashier didn't speak unless asked a direct question then mumbled inaudible answers.
 Untrained staff, limited food available, and unreasonable wait times. Overheard manage telling customer \"we were too busy to cook more chicken.\"  That's like Betty Crocker being too busy to bake a cake!  That's what you do! You're a chicken place and you're too busy to cook chicken?  Come on.
KFC is next door.  Next time I have a chicken craving I'll try that instead."}
{"text":"Horrific service! Not once was I thanked for being a customer. I told the woman taking my order thank you several times, yet she ignored me. She handed over my food and ignored me even standing there. I thanked her, and wished her a good evening, to which I got no reply. This is the first time I have gone into the dining room, and it will be my last. The drive through is always friendly however. But with their being a bojangles almost on every corner, I will be taking my business to another location that actually cares about me being there."}
{"text":"Bojangles had always Been one of my favorites...but on my last visit we Had to wait for them to cook chicken. We were the only customers and then when our chicken arrived there was literally deep fried feathers on one piece!    Really????? Will not be back."}
{"text":"Classic Bo's. I've had better biscuits and fries at other locations, but this location was one of the cleanest I've visited."}
{"text":"It's okay IF you like to wait seems to always be busy and the service is pretty slow also sometimes the biscuits are hard like rocks and stuff one day I asked for a biscuit but they gave me a BURGER not even close to my order I'm giving them two stars if I was mean just one"}
{"text":"It took 20 minutes to get our food and it wasn't even busy.  Avoid this location.  Why do BoJangles virtually everywhere struggle in the exact same way."}
{"text":"Yes! My favorite fast food place (those words should not go together)!

Spicy fried chicken: yes
Dirty rice: yes
Cajun season fries: yes
Made from scratch biscuits: yes
Sweet tea: yes
SUPREMES: yes yes yes

This place is soooo addicting. Don't confuse my rating, 3 stars is about as high as I can go for fast food, so it's a 5 compared to any other chains out there."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this Bojangles. Burned bo-rounds and only two sips of sweet tea in my large cup because it was filled to the top with ice. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I would frequent this Bojangles on my way into work in the morning. Employees are really nice and respectful inside the restaurant and in the drive thru. This Bojangles is hit or miss though. Sometimes their service is speedy, other times it is extremely extremely extremely slow. I am allergic to the majority of the food they have, so I usually just get Bo'rounds when I visit the restaurant. Those have been hit or miss coming from here as well. If they're not fresh and hot, they are cold and stale - which makes them disgusting."}
{"text":"I couldn't get any better service at a restaurant than what I got here.  The food was good and hot. A very gracious server even provided gravy for the biscuit! I will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went through the drive this morning. Overall it's a quick and painless. The worst part is that every time the card machine won't read our card. Then we end up not getting a receipt. Today, we didn't get a receipt and going on the honor system that we will be charged the correct amount. We've been about 5 times in the last 2 weeks and no receipt. It must be a new policy. Today my husband's drink never got to us and we had already pulled away and back on the road. Plus, we had no receipt to prove we were supposed to get his receipt. The girl at the window is super sweet just really quiet and I can see why. The supervisor that was near by was asking what was taking her so long. I felt so bad for her because you could tell it upset her. Hopefully things will improve or I'll have to find a different location to eat at."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru. Ordered Cajun filet sandwich w no mayo. Got home to eat my sandwich and mayo had been scraped off the bun. Still all over the lettuce and tomato. REALLY??? Disgusting. Take some pride in your food quality!"}
{"text":"As far as a fast food place goes, this location needs some supervision from HQ.  It is generally clean, but regularly \"behind.\"

Orders taken are slow to come forward.  Frustrating when you are ordering chicken that is already on the serving line.  

The beverage area is usually out of something, so if you did get your food you might have to wait for someone to refill the iced tea or ice machine.

The drive-thru is horrible.  You can park, go inside, wait in line, wait for your food and wait for your beverage, leave and get back to your car faster than languishing in the drive-thru.  And if there are four or more cars in line...forget it.

My biggest irritation is that their chicken is scrawny.  A drum stick looks shrunken and so do the wings.  I cannot understand this Indian Land location as they get the same supplies as the other Bojangles locations.  Go further north on Hwy 521 and the Bojangles across from Chick Filet has meaty chicken and quicker and more efficient service.

This is why I do not regularly go to this location, preferring to go further up the road to another.

The bosses need to look at this location."}
{"text":"I gotta be honest, we went in to use their WiFi. We ended up staying for lunch, and surprisingly it was pretty good. Compared to other Bojangles I have been to at least. I'm a Popeye's fan, but that wasn't an option. I ordered the chicken supremes combo, and asked the clerk to make sure that the tenders were decent sized, not nuggets like you know who has. She smiled (what?), and went and selected the tenders herself. She served them with a smile again (huh?), and thanked me for coming in. I wasn't expecting any like that to happen.

So 4 stars for a fast food joint, based mostly on the service I got."}
{"text":"This Bojangles really has their act together. They are very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Food is OK but they still can not get an order right.

Bojangles has good Chicken Biscuits and Coffee but for some reason, can not get a drive through order right. For a time I stopped even bothering with this location in hopes that they would improve.

Last week I tried them again.  Guess what.  Could not get the order right again.

Good product but again, you do like to get what you order.  If you are pickey enough to expect to get what you order, then you are taking you chances. If you like Las Vegas, you might enjoy this place but let me put it this way, house odds are against you."}
{"text":"Rude staff that didn't say one word during our transaction. Kinda of awkward actually. They were also out of dark meat. I'll avoid this Bojangles at all costs. This was my second bad experience at this location."}
{"text":"Good food. Quick service. And my fries were hot. Cold Bojangles fries are no good at all so definitely important for them to be hot. I added extra seasoning salt which made them even more delicious. They have $4 combos now which is cool. The portion sizes are also good."}
{"text":"Came here early on a Monday. Was filled with blue collar men getting ready for a days work of labor: blue jeans, work boots, sweet tea, chicken biscuits. Some arse peed all over the rim of the toilet though. Gross. Good job, whoever his wife is..."}
{"text":"Horrible service. If you do go here go inside so that you can check your food. The food is good if you get the right order. My biggest complaint is how they just throw your food in a bag and how when you order chicken strips they are more like chicken nuggets. I have had to go inside several times to ask for bigger strips because it is like they pick out the smallest ones for the drive thru. I love Bo jangels food but the service needs work."}
{"text":"Customer service is important. I was treated really rudely by an employee working the drive through when I got out to pick up money I dropped. I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Sooooooo I realize that this is Bojangles and it's a fast food establishment....but things still need to be sanitary!  My husband wanted to stop here on the way out of town- I did not but went along with it.  Bad idea.

He got egg and cheese biscuits.  I got a plain biscuit and a boberry biscuit.  Breakfast hall of shame.  I was all ready to eat my biscuit (plain) and noticed a black thing in it.  My husband told me it was a berry.  Then I explained this was the plain- not the boberry!  Well the \"berry\" was a fly baked INTO my biscuit.  Really?!  I guess they really don't pay attention to what is happening at this location!  So gross.

I emailed corporate with a photo and explained how this was no acceptable.  I did get a nice voicemail- but I was really hoping for a refund as a I requested and expected since it was seriously disgusting and not sanitary at all.  But- what can you do?  I just won't visit ever again."}
{"text":"stone cold food and grumpy service, this place is going down hill fast, just not the same!"}
{"text":"It's Bojangles and every Bojangles is awesome. My favorite breakfast sandwich is their Cajun filet biscuit."}
{"text":"When it comes to \"fast food\" Fried Chicken; it doesn't get any better than Bojangles. And their dirty rice is awesome. Once you eat some you'll want more. This location also features Cheerwine."}
{"text":"Worst bojangles ever. If you want to wait 15 mins for fast food, go here. So slow. You're better off going to the bojangles down the street. Seriously, do not go here."}
{"text":"Ok, so we don't have Bojangles in NY so we stop here.  The lady with the European accent in the morning....you are the nicest person.  Third time in three years I think and she's just as friendly.  

Ok, it's pretty standard fast food but McDonalds it's not.  Biscuits sandwiches are just so yummy as are all the breakfast sandwiches.  That steak on a biscuit?  I freaking love it!! I just could not eat like this all the time but for a road trip?  Well, yummy"}
{"text":"I ordered two biscuit sandwiches and both were ruined by hard, overcooked biscuits.  Their dirty rice however was delicious."}
{"text":"I worked at bojangles for two years and never in my life have I ever visited one that's as filthy and slow as they are.  

Nothing is ever fresh yet you still wait 10 minutes for a simple biscuit.  

Since I've worked for bojangles and know all of their policy and health regulations. So when I sit in the drive thru, I watch.  
The stuff they get away with doing would not fly in front of corporate.  

Employees are not enthusiastic like they should be, they're rude actually.  

Never returning until they get their crap together."}
{"text":"Don't eat here they keep giving raw food. I keep trying to give them a shot but they are not getting any better I know there are ways that they can check the food"}
{"text":"I love this chain, and this particular location is one of the best I've been to. I can only base this on the drive-thru, but the employees are extra polite and they always get my order correct. The food is prepared to perfection every time, and many times I have to wait just a few minutes while they prepare fresh chicken or Bo-Rounds (my favorite). I'd rather wait a little for fresh food than get something that's been sitting under the heat lamp anyway. Now if I could just clone their cajun pintos in my own kitchen I'd be in heaven."}
{"text":"Everytime I come it's either a long wait or the food is disgusting. Never get anything good here. If it wasn't for Susan I WOULD NOT come to this bojangles! The one on 160 is so much better, both service and food!"}
{"text":"This bojangles sucks.  Go to the one in huntersville.  Fries are never fresh and the orders are always wrong"}
{"text":"Good food with friendly service. Very reasonably priced. 
Like that i can get breakfast any time of the day."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would.  You could pick any other Bojangles in the area and have a drastically better experience.  There is always a problem.  Every time.  It blows my mind how you can have a chain fast food restaurant and still not have things consistently down pat.  The last straw happened when I waited with my family after church in the drive through for 18 minutes *after* I had paid.  And I came back after we got home because the order still was not right.  I let the manager have it and called the district manager.  The district manager called me a few days later and let me know how he was going to fix things, but I doubt anything will change.  Bojangles is a pretty safe bet around here, just stay away from this one!"}
{"text":"After enough time passes I always think I'll give this restaurant another try because it's only minutes from my home. Time after time I regret my decision. The food is consistently awful and ends up in the trash. If I sound grumpy it's because my (carry out) dinner was so disgusting I couldn't eat it. The fries were undercooked, greasy and soggy. The Cajun filet biscuit squirted out grease when I bit into it and the chicken was slimy and gooey. I didn't eat it fearing I would get sick if I did."}
{"text":"Bojangles is your standard fast food fried chicken joint, and since I like chicken, it's A-OK by me. The service normally leaves a bit to be desired, but the only reasons I would sing about Bojangles are:

1. The Biscuits -- They are so good--so soft, so fluffy, so buttery--that it was the first thing I asked for when I got off the plane from England. 

2. The Chicken Fingers -- Nicely seasoned, but the breading can be a bit hard (and that's how you know they've been sitting out all day).

3. The Sweet Tea -- Worth writing a dissertation on.  So sweet, you take one sip and schedule a filling with your dentist. 

4. The Price -- 1 wing + 1 leg + 2 fixins (mac & cheese, pinto beans [although I suggest the green beans or collards]) + buscuit= ***$3.99***

In these trying economic times, it's just what the doctor ordered. 

Hallelujah."}
{"text":"My sandwich was dry and cold after waiting 15 minutes in the drive through behind only 2 other cars.  I could see my order the entire time sitting in the window blowing in the wind.  Then when I finally pulled up the cashier didn't even say one word to me.  I love Bojangles but would avoid this one at all costs...just get your fried chicken from publix if you are in the area and need a quick fried chicken fix."}
{"text":"Just stopped in and found out they have a new manager and the visit was great!  Maybe we should give them some more chances to earn our business."}
{"text":"This location is the closest to my home and we visit often.  They never get anything right.  Always getting home n finding things missing from sides, biscuits, to the number of condiments you are suppose to get with meals.  Today my husband swung by to grab food. Each time we go we are spending between 40.00 n 50.00.  On meals n drinks.  It's aggravating to get home.  N take a sip of your sweet tea to only have a very bad taste in your mouth because it is SOUR.  N to find missing items. Geez Louise.  I am so irritated with this location.  There's no excuse to get it wrong every time.  Start making it right n I will update this rating."}
{"text":"This place is filthy. On the counter where I picked up my food, there was a big honey looking spill. No on bothered to clean it as my food was pushed across the counter. Where I went get my straw and napkins, there was a dirty rag and cleaning bottle. The health department would love that.The reason a gave two stars is that the staff was very nice and the Rice Bowl was good. I just hope I don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"The cashier was not friendly.   Ordered two, two piece diners with one side. The food was hot and tasty.  

The dining room only had one clean table.   They were not busy."}
{"text":"Being a Northerner, I've heard of Bojangles but not too much. After seeing them all over the place in my recent trip to the Charlotte area, I decided I would see if they were any good. 

I happened to be here and chose this location to try. What? It wasn't listed on Yelp? I'll fix that. You're welcome, Fort Mill, SC. 

I will say this... If they had these Cajun chicken biscuit sandwiches in Philadelphia, I'd harden my arteries more on these alone."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service.  Went through drive thru and my order was delivered accurately and quickly. I asked for extra icing on my Boberry biscuits and they showed me them first to make sure enough extra icing was on them. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"A 45 minute wait for a 3 wing dinner? Ridiculous! Stop selling all your chicken at the drive through, and balance it out with your inside customers!"}
{"text":"They are awesome- drive-through is hilarious
Bec biscuits a bit too greasy but still delish
Mmm"}
{"text":"I love the new cheddar biscuit. I normally have mine with sausage. The staff at this place is great. Friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Bojangles on 29 in Kannapolis, is DISGUSTING!!!! I wouldn't recommend eating here to my worst enemy! They don't use gloves when handling boxes for food or the wax paper used to place the food on! I witnessed the register boy, go and handle a food scoop for the rice WITHOUT GLOVES OR WASHING HIS HANDS and then dropped the entire scoop handle and all, in the drum of rice, after him and everyone else has handled it with bare hands. After calling and complaining I was told by the manager that they aren't required to wear gloves on the front line  that makes no sense. Especially working in the restaurant industry myself. I KNOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WEAR GLOVES WHEN HANDELING ANYTHING TO DO WITH FOOD!!!!!! Needless to say she did get a mouthful after catching an attitude with me about the register person handling money and then utensils. Not to mention I also witnessed the same pair of tongs being used for bacon get used for borounds after he pulled his pants up as well! Now I know that may not seem like a big deal but some people don't eat pork and have nothing to do with pork of any kind. (Not saying I don't but that's still not okay to do) I wouldn't even give one star but being that I had to star this to post it....there's one"}
{"text":"My youngest loves Bojangles.  She was pretty happy with her food this evening, probably because she was hungry.  The fries were hot and well seasoned, as always.  The biscuit was luke warm.  Had we stayed to eat in, I would have returned it.  The biscuits are fabulous when they are hot but lukewarm not a chance.  However, she was not phased by it so I am giving the restaurant 4 stars for fast, friendly service and making my child happy."}
{"text":"You really know what to expect when going to a Bojangles. However, this location seems to really try to get your order right.  The employees are friendly and they tend to the dining area nicely.  The place has a clean appearance even though the building has some age on it.  I stop here on a somewhat regular basis and get constant quality."}
{"text":"2 Stars for a Boj's?! I must be crazy, but there was something wrong about this Bojangles.  I'm not sure why this place is set pretty far back beyond the Carowinds exit and I-77.  Definitely not as convenient as other locations (especially when located near an interstate).

I had to got in line and the girl gave me a \"I'll be with you in one second\" bark while she was filling a rather large order of 3 huge boxes ok chicken.  When she finally got to me (after 5min) she didn't even apologize for the wait.. and she gave me a huge attitude.  Yes, I know you may have been challenged by that large order, but there are other paying customers waiting as well!

I don't mean to harp on this girl, but she had 3 different color eye shadows on... yellow, pink, and blue and it was extremely off putting in addition to the attitude.

Did my biscuit come out promptly?  Yes.  Did it taste good?  Yes... but the service was horrible and that definitely affects the whole dining experience.  The tea was out and the counter was all spilled and spotted with sticky syrup...."}
