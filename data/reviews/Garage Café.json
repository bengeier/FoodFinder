{"text":"Super restaurant de quartier. Leurs burgers frites sont bons, pas trop gras et pas chers."}
{"text":"This place has a nice vibe to it, and while my veggie burger was a little meh, my salad was delicious. I'll probably come back to try some likelier-sounding options (meat burgers, perchance?), particularly since it's so close to home."}
{"text":"This place provides a much needed little spot for eats and drinks in Verdun.  The menu has options for both veggies and meat-eaters and the fries are delicious. I also recommend their salmon, salads, mussels and their customizable individual pizzas are tasty too. They make good mixed drinks, have yummy pitchers of sangria made with red or white wine, beer on tap, and a covered side patio as well as an outdoor terrace out front.  The décor looks a lot like its namesake, a garage, with little decorative pieces and a roll up garage door that leads to the side patio. It's a snug fit in a smaller space but not uncomfortably so... they arrange seating for groups of people and yes, the staff are very francophone but are always welcoming, friendly and have happily obliged to speak English when I've brought anglo friends there who struggled with french.  I tend to only go here in warmer weather because of the patio, but I'm glad it's in my hood."}
{"text":"Burger est super, décor est simple mais conviviale. J'aime l'ambience. Biere est delicieuse."}
{"text":"Je retourne à l'occasion à ce resto avec ma copine, c'est bien sans être extraordinaire.  Le service peut-étire lent à l'occasion.  La nourriture est bonne mais le choix pourrait être plus diversifié...."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé cet endroit. Très bonne ambiance. Le repas était correct parce que les aliments étaient authentiques, soit le prosciutto en était. Le service était long mais excellent. Le resto était bondé, fallait s'y attendre avec des gros groupes. Mais les serveuses, pas impatientes du tout étaient très  gentilles. Contente de connaître ce nouvel endroit."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to one of my fav places, Joe Blo, for my birthday but the restaurant was closed for a private event. I was too cold to walk for long to find an alternate spot and was close to settling for pizza delivery until my friend remembered a cool restaurant nearby that he had gone to once...  As soon as I walked in, I felt warm and cozy. Maybe it was because I was cold and any place with a temperature above -5 degrees would have felt great, but there was something about this place that made me feel right at home, as if I was in someone's living room. Upon arrival, we were immediately welcomed by our friendly waitress and were given the table of our choice. Both my friend and I opted for the burger special with salad and fries. The special for that day was a burger topped with a cheddar bacon sauce, strips of bacon, and onion rings. There was a little too much if the cheddar sauce for my liking, but whatever I could just scrape some off. The burger itself was cooked well an had great flavor. The fries were nothing special...just basic French fries similar to what you'd find in a fast food place. But, they were hot and a few shakes of salt and pepper helped. I was pleasantly surprised by the drink prices, which were some of the lowest I've seen. We both had pints of beer, which were nice and cold. There's nothing like a cold burger and a cold beer. For dessert, we each had a delicious chocolate-coconut bar with some kind of cream filling. I'm not a fan of coconut, but I really liked it.   I truly enjoyed this restaurant. It's just a few block from where my friend lives, and I can see us spending time here whenever we want to go out for a drink, but desire a more casual, laid-back atmosphere. Sure there are better burger places, but I would not hesitate to return to this one."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant de quartier vraiment génial surtout l'été en raison de la terrasse et de la section semi-ouverte. Il s'agit d'un endroit hyper décontracté, parfait pour les lunchs entre amis ou avec la famille. J'apprécie que le restaurant ne soit pas bruyant même lorsqu'il est rempli.   Le personnel est sympathique et accueillant. Le service est parfois un peu lent, mais ça va tout de même. Les plats arrivent toujours à la table bien chauds. Tout ce à quoi j'ai goûté jusqu'à maintenant était bon, je n'ai jamais été déçue. Le Garage offre une grande variété d'excellents burgers; il s'agit de leur spécialité si j'ai bien compris. Les pâtes sont également très bonnes et les portions assez généreuses! De plus, les prix sont plus que raisonnables."}
{"text":"Overall first time experience is pretty good. I decided to share a few starters with my girlfriend.  We had the calamari, cheese sticks, bruschetta and a onion soup. Everything was very tasty and to my satisfaction, I'll definitely come back again.   Also the drinks aren't very expensive, I had a pint of Cheval Blanc and it was only 6$ my girlfriend had a bloody Cesar and it cost 5.50 so not very pricey.   Definitely loud but that's to be expected because it is mostly like a bar and not \"cafe\" as promoted in the company name."}
{"text":"Lovely place, homemade food and the prices are amazing. Recently they extended the menu. Always, you might enjoy the set menu"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Yesterday my firends and I wented to garage cafe around 8:00pm, and we've been told we CANNOT just order wine or coffee except we order the dinner (we already finished dinner in someother place), we told the waitress that we would like to have fries and desserts and she refused to service. And half of the restruant was empty......  The place seems nice but the service was so rude."}
{"text":"The staff were super friendly and great coffee! I wish I could go at night to check out the bar side too!!"}
{"text":"If you want to drink alcohol here you'll need to order a meal. Fortunately, the food here is delicious! What I expected was typical, greasy pub food but what I got was a well made hamburger and fries that was different and yet deliciously familiar. It's atmosphere is very friendly and you feel like you've escaped into a small town where everyone knows eachother!"}
{"text":"Ingredients were good but could of been prepared better"}
{"text":"Le bistro de quartier par excellence.  Un menu étoffé. Une nourriture simple, bonne et à prix doux. La pinte de bière est économique. L'ambiance est cool. Un resto idéal pour partager un repas entre amis."}
{"text":"Super reliable neighbourhood spot that's recently been renovated to be even more welcoming. Indoor section, + outdoor tables in the summer + a semi open area that's wonderful on a sunny day. They do everything well: burgers, salads, sandwiches, grilled mains, etc. Their pizza is thin crust with lots of cheese and fully customizable toppings. I think they might have the best fries in the city for real. Thin, crispy guys and always served with a delicious aioli for dipping. Try a featured moule + frites (they change the sauce / broth recipe regularly) and pair with a pint of Cheval Blanc for a perrrfect lunch."}
{"text":"I live near this restaurant, and like the previous reviewer, its true, its hard to find decent places in Verdun. (I have to say it is improving a lot!)  I like Garage Cafe, cool atmosphere, and they make a killer mixed drink called Lili's. Their fries are great and their fare is decent. I think you get what you pay for. I personally like their salads (they are plentiful) and their pizzas are good too.  They are child friendly (they have two high chairs - be careful though, one of them has a broken belt!). They prefer that patrons speak in French, but I find that typical of Verdun and its fine by me! (After all, we are in Montreal!)"}
{"text":"Overpriced for terrible food. The fries are bland and tasteless. The chicken wings and sauce are not good, more sour than hot and everything is way overpriced for the quality of eats there. I've also had the chicken burger. It was bland, tasteless and cold by the time I got it, and I now avoid going to the Garage Café. So many better places to explore and eat at in Verdun!"}
{"text":"Great place and service for the price.  Pros: Very friendly, very willing to attempt to communicate with us (Americans) in English, Extensive menu, Cheap relative to Montreal dining, Hang-out for \"locals\", Chatty servers (in a good way), fun themed decor, delicious variety of burgers, great french fries  Cons: Took quite a while for a pretty standard order, it was very crowded though and they were paying close attention to guests. Not a huge issue, but can't give it a  5 because we went there for a quick burger."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  I went two nights in a row, I liked it so much.  I'm from LA, and there's just something about it, being in Verdun, slightly small-town-ish, by virtue of its unpretentious warmth and informality, yet urbane.  The food is quite superior, and moderately priced.  The 5.95 garden salad is just delicious, already predressed, with lovely ingredients including almonds, cranberries, tomatoes, cucumber, olives, etc.  I had the pasta arrabiatta, which was just delicious. My aunt had the burger, which she said was great. The French fries were light and flavorful.  The servers were all extremely gracious.  The pasta was 11.50 for a very large portion. The burger with fries was about 9.  Recommended."}
{"text":"I'm still trying to discover new places to get some decent grub in my neighborhood but Verdun is not so easy. The area is replete with 99¢ pizza joints and littered with hot-dog stops. Respectable feeding is hard to come by.  But they're around and slowly I'll tread the waters. The other day I tried the Garage Café, a Pizza slash burger slash pasta restaurant. Reassuringly the place was packed and people were standing outside drinking. The place looks like the neighborhood food stop filled with regulars that simply walked to get there.   The décor is a bit patchy but has flair of its own, service is friendly but a bit slow but they try with all the traffic. The menu is varied but offers nothing innovating yet isn't boring either. Fun comfort food to have with beer, wine or sangria.   As is often the case, I'm in no mood for alcohol after work (Unless I'm not working the next day) so I ordered a Coca-cola and this was the interesting part, they serve it in a Mason jar that has a handle on it. Loved the idea so much I want some of my own now.  Not feeling the pasta menu because it's my fall-back plan when I don't know what to prepare for myself at home I hit the Burger Menu, something I never get bored of. I love a good burger so much I'd eat one for breakfast and I have in the past thanks to American Diners. So I went for the Four By Four.   The Four by Four is a healthy helping of Beef (of course) and Philly Cream Cheese, Bacon and fried Mushrooms and Onions. All ingredients I simply can't get enough. Sadly I didn't get enough. The patty was a whopper but seriously if you're gonna be a restaurant called the GARAGE CAFÉ, to me it seems like a grease monkey wouldn't eat a flimsy burger and with the price, gimme something to chew on.  Burger 101: A burger must be meaty, juicy, greasy and yes a sloppy mess. But also it's gotta be heavy on the toppings and I'm not talking ketchup.   If you tell me you're gonna put some Philly Cream cheese, don't scrape it on; slather it on thick. The mushrooms? I want them flowing from the sides. And the bacon... the bacon. How many times have I said this? Life has no meaning without bacon. This was the big epic FAIL of this Burger that coulda-been. When I go to my local La Belle Province - often derided for being the bottom of the barrel of fast food restaurants in Montreal - and order a bacon-cheese burger, the cook takes out 3 or 4 slices of fresh uncooked bacon and drops them on the grill before taking out the fresh burger patties and then making me a super fresh and tasty messy sloppy burger. But at Garage Café, I got one tiny slice of pre-cooked bacon. Come On! And the patty was to perfectly round and well shaped to be fresh prepared.  The fries were pretty damn tasty though and it was served with a side of very tangy and spicy mayonnaise that added some serious punch to the burger. The burger wasn't bad in the final analysis it just could have easily been an out of this world kick-ass burger with a few simple steps.  3 buns outta 5"}
{"text":"Great place to come eat. My boyfriend and i got a bunch of appetizers we got cheese sticks, onion soup, bruschetta, and calamari and it was all fantastic and not expensive at all! Cute little place i went sunday night almost all seats were taken but it was still pleasant it wasn't to loud or crowded. Waitresses are very nice, the food came fast.  Very happy to come to garage cafe for a date night!"}
{"text":"Premièrement, ce bistro prend tout son sens été, hiver dans un samedi soir on est entassé comme des sardines. Les hamburger sont bon pour un bistro. Il y a mieux à verdun"}
{"text":"My hubby and I enjoyed it here.   It literally is a garage. A very neat concept. Not too big, yet not too small.  The two girls who were working on Sunday at lunchtime were so nice. :-) They filled up our waters diligently and both of them at separate occasions passed by and asked us if it was to our taste.   There was a Table D'Hote menu that had very appealing choices; I had trouble choosing what I wanted to eat. I ended up ordering the Chicken Wrap w/ Grilled Veggies, Cheese + Green Salad & Tea / Desert of the Day. The wrap was *really* delicious. Hubby ordered one of the deluxe burgers and it came with fires. It wasn't earth-shattering, but it was good.   Definitely Return Worthy!"}
{"text":"J'adore ce petit restaurant de quartier!"}
{"text":"La nourriture est toujours EXCELLENTE, surtout les burgers. Le service est super, rapide.  L'ambiance est géniale, quoiqu'un peu bruyant, surtout à l'heure du diner le vendredi."}
{"text":"Garage Café est l'un des endroits que je recommande quand des gens viennent à Verdun pour une première fois et qu'ils ont le goût d'aller prendre un verre. Le seul bémol par contre est qu'à Verdun, il n'y a pas de bars comme tel, donc vous devez être prêt à manger un repas avec vos consommations.  J'y ai été à quelques reprises donc j'ai eu la chance de goûter à leurs pizzas, pâtes, steaks, hamburgers et nachos. Tous étaient très bons et à des prix raisonnables. Les assiettes sont aussi toujours arrivées dans un temps raisonnable et la nourriture était chaude juste comme il faut.  Bien que le service et l'ambiance soient aussi biens, j'ai l'impression qu'il manque un petit quelque chose pour que l'endroit ressorte de l'ordinaire et qu'il se démarque des autres restos du quartier. J'aimerais bien que Garage Café devienne un endroit où j'aurais le goût d'aller plus régulièrement mais je ne peu pas identifier ce qui me chicote."}
{"text":"Beau, bon, pas cher! Endroit idéal pour un lunch entre amis, en famille, en couple ou seul. Bonne ambiance, bon service, bon menu, bonne bouffe, j'adore ce restau, surtout que les prix sont vmt pas élevés :)"}
{"text":"Went there to order some cocktails to pre-drink, but was informed we had to order food as well. We tried to order a small appetizer but then was told we had to order food that was a certain price or higher as it won't count otherwise. We were frustrated as we weren't hungry, but ordered an entree of wings, mozzarella sticks and calamari plus a pitcher of sangria. The food was cold, greasy and tasteless, and the sangria was bland and didn't even taste like alcohol. Won't ever be back."}
