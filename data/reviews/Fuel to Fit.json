{"text":"The last month has been amazing! With my busy schedule and life style I don't have time to shop and cook, and end up eating a lot of take out, which isn't always healthy. 
Let's be honest, who wants to spend a whole day food prepping for the following week, when you can get super healthy food delivered to you.
Not only is fuel to fit meals really healthy, but they are so delicious as well. The menu changes from week to week and food is just amazing. Not only do the meals taste amazing, but every meal I have had has looked super appetizing as well. 
With the free deliveries twice a week to either your work or home the meals are always fresh and full of flavor. 
If you're looking for a meal prep company to make your life easier, look no further this is by far the best meal prep company in the valley."}
{"text":"I have  top cooks, my grandma , my dads mom , my moms mom, My sister, my mom , and Fuel To Fit, food is amazing if it wasn't in a To Go Food prep container it would be priced at $15-35 plate. Must try and food is super fresh"}
{"text":"I love this company, the variety of food and portions are great. I love that they have delivery available to most areas but mine, haha! I'm not on a ketogenic diet but try to stay low carb so this is perfect for me."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried another meal prep service and were not that impressed after about a month. We tried Fuel To Fit and it was the best decision ever. The food is tasty, healthy, and changes every week. We love being able to order which specific meals we want and how many each week. The macros are always a great breakdown and they work perfectly for any meal. Franchesca has been extremely friendly anytime I've interacted with her as well. We feel like important customers! They also leave the food in an ice chest or cooler if you aren't available during the delivery time. I highly recommend you try Fuel to Fit if you are looking for real recipes and chef restaurant quality food!"}
{"text":"These are the best prep meals I've had in a while. I've tried several other similar types of preparations, but I definitely feel Fuel to Fit has higher quality meals, more reliable delivery, and better customer interaction. I highly recommend them. Ordering Fuel to Fit for the next corporate event."}
{"text":"So far so good. The food is fulfilling and taste great. This is a no brainer for meals. They have great customer service and delivery timing is great. Looking forward to supporting this great meal prep company."}
{"text":"Part of our success in our business and personal lives comes from leveraging our time and utilizing services from our valuable business partners. Recently we have partnered with Fuel to Fit meal prep for our daily lunches and dinners. We chose to go with Fuel to Fit because of the personal attention from the owner Franchesca. She is local here in the Phoenix area, and offers a huge variety of well balanced meals. Each week a new menu goes out and you get to pick from a variety of choices. She delivers the meals to us, made fresh most of the time, made the day of and does this twice a week. Since replacing a minimum of one meal a day I have lost 6 lbs. That is an average of 2lbs per week. I will continue to utilize your service and will be for you to everyone I know."}
