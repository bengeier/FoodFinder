{"text":"Let me get the one big negative out of the way: nowhere in the place are prices shown. Not anywhere. Not on the menu board, not on the counter or the display case or on any kind of sign. Sure, people who own homes in Baby Point can ignore such trivialities, but not the rest of us. More transparency, please!  Otherwise, we love this spot. Bright, airy, and mostly comfortable (except for those metal stools), with exceptional coffee, fascinating and unusual beverages (I tried the tumeric latte most recently) and a great philosophy about environmental respect and quality product.  Location is a bit out of the way. But while not especially convenient for us, we go anyway. The video screen with updated bus information is a great idea--riders can grab a coffee without worrying about missing their ride. Wifi seems good, music is listenable, and faces are friendly.  We are looking forward to future visits. Just let us know the prices, okay?"}
{"text":"Great first experience! The coffee is excellent with top notch service. Lots of comfortable space to hang out or meet for coffee. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good coffee and flaky meat pies? Yes please. Only decent coffee I've had in the neighbourhood. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff, good WiFi, excellent coffee and pastries. It was the coffee spot I've been looking for in Bloor West Village. A solid place to work and get caffeinated in a friendly space.  Also, great for kids-- there are child sized seating options and non-caffeinated drinks."}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop with a relaxed and chill vibe. Aussie meat pies, locally made pastries, and decadent sweet treats are great accompaniments to wonderfully crafted espresso based drinks.  The owner is passionate about coffee and it definitely shines through in the final product!"}
{"text":"I give five stars for quality, price, and welcome. A brilliant place where I will be a regular customer from now on. They also have WONDERFUL meat pies at sensible prices - large to take home, or small to have with your coffee.  This  Coffee Shop is also extremely clean."}
{"text":"A great addition to the neighbourhood, as there are no true indie coffee shops in walking distance.  My wife tells me their coffee tastes great, while I enjoyed having a cookie there.  The owner is very friendly.  I was impressed that the shop has a small tv by the door showing the bus schedule/status, so that customers can enjoy being in the cafe, and minimize the time spent standing out on the street.  Very thoughtful!"}
{"text":"A standout spot in an unassuming area very West of the city. It's cheerful and bright, with an ambience that you don't expect from the area. Had a meat pie (wonderful), Americano, and a piece of carrot loaf. Meat pie was an obvious choice and provides a nice change for a hearty cafe snack.  Can't say I'm in the area often but will definitely be back if I am."}
{"text":"I simply don't understand how I haven't checked this place out sooner!   Upon entering I was already interested to have a seat if I didn't have an appointment booked 20 minutes next door.    So cute and inviting; this place offers a cozy place to sit and quietly have a coffee.    I ordered a matcha latte and a ginger cookie.   The latte was prepared just right and not too sweet nor bitter.    The ginger cookie made an excellent pairing.  Lattes and pretty eyelash extensions unite!"}
{"text":"At long last, a pretty legit Aussie spot!   All I remember of cafes in Aus is that they have consistently great coffee and drinks, the nicest people, and are always unique but laid back. This one is no different.   Owner is super into it, and has a ton of great background and philanthropic work he brought to this project of his. Thoughtful details, great products, and tons of fair dinkum Australiana for any nostalgic ex-pats around.   Seriously hope this place survives the Jane Street vortex!"}
{"text":"Out in the far west edges of Toronto, I was dying for a good kick of caffeine and stumbled into this sunny bright spot in Baby Point.  I LOVED the fact the owner is an Aussie who's love of all things coffee which includes the true flat white.  The cafe is super bright and sunny with it's bold yellow accents everywhere and really open spacious.  The back wall is where you can order up your drinks and snacks.  I loved how they had Lamington's there... I haven't seen them in years!  I really enjoyed getting my drink here as the owner was just great and friendly.  Flat White with Almond Milk - Smooth, well balanced, and flavourful... sure it doesnt have fancy little leaf on it but you dont need it when it tastes this good.  4/5  If I'm ever in the edges of Toronto again, I'll be happy to stop by and grab a drink here."}
{"text":"Jake makes this place what it is. I love grabbing a great coffee with a guaranteed smile in the morning.   Try the golden (turmeric) latte. A new fave! Lots of snacks to offer: breakfast sandwiches, Australian meat pies, croissants hot out of the oven, quinoa muffins, cinnamon rolls, etc.   You can wait for the bus while sipping a hot drink, since there's a live bus schedule on the tv by the door - great for us transit users on cold days."}
