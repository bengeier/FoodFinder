{"text":"I ordered food from Grubhub for delivery from here. Estimated time said 90 mins. It took over 3 hours to get my food. The food arrived cold and barely edible after microwaving it. I will never be ordering from here again. The place is less than 10 mins from my house yet it took 3 hours to get cold food? HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Especially love the laid back and cozy atmosphere. Timbers is a great place to go after a long day. All the waitresses are fabulous, especially Michelle."}
{"text":"Worst service I've seen in any bar in Las Vegas.  Do not go here if you want to get a drink! Bartenders spent the entire time chatting with each other and ignoring the customers.  I had to stop playing, get up from my seat & walk around the entire bar, then raise my voice to get their attention because they were so caught up in their own little world they couldn't be bothered to do their jobs. George and Crystal are the worst staff I have ever experienced in Las Vegas.  Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Food was marginal at best. Acceptable, good, etc. Nothing spectacular. Service was slooooooow. There is no way it's takes an hour to cook a burger and a chicken wrap. The place wasn't packed or anything, maybe they are understaffed in the back. Not sure. Our waitress was pleasant, but she was also a little slow. Could be a bunch of new people on a Tuesday evening. I recommend giving them a try if the menu interests you, just be warned about the possibility of a long meal."}
{"text":"Danielle is amazing! Came here once.. over a month ago... and she remembered what my boyfriend and I drink... THAT is an awesome waitress!"}
{"text":"I was contacted by the GM of the store, Gary. He asked if I had received his telephone message from earlier that morning (which I had not). Then he realized that he had called a different customer who had a different complaint. He was very friendly and polite and asked my about what happened. He apologized but offered no remedy to the situation.  I left him my phone number and told him to let me know when a change takes place.......then we'll be back."}
{"text":"Bar is decked with Chargers yet don't play the Chargers games...won't be coming back because of that..2nd reason won't be coming back waited a hour for our breakfast order because the \"cook\" didn't put in our order. Bad Service, Fake Charger bar! No discount given = no tip."}
{"text":"Hands down best bar service ever! Katie & Ray rock it! Edward the cook consistently the best fingers I've ever had in my LIFE. No joke."}
{"text":"Went for our first time & it was good. Was afraid might be loud and smoky but ambiance good and airy once we got past the front door, where it did smell smoky.  Waitress was good and manager stopped by & we had friendly chat.  Food = biscuits & gravy were good, gravy had good amount of sausage with very nice flavor...a little skimpy on the amount of gravy but some patrons might like less. Bacon excellent, the hash browns are peeled not shredded and very good. Scrambled eggs had a bit more egg white in than I prefer in scrambled but overall good.  I've had trouble with restaurant coffee lately attacking the stomach but this was flavorful mild coffee that caused no problem.  Since they did a nice job on breakfast we'll be back soon to check lunch. They have a Hawaiian burger or sliders that looks promising."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for breakfast and the service was great (Sabrina) and the food amazing! We went back that night and again, great service (Ashley) and awesome food, this time with some drinks to boot!"}
{"text":"The worst place I have ever been to. I went with a friend to have a couple beers and gamble.  The first words out of the bartender ' s mouth was i started a tab...we'll see how much money you spend ...i spent $30 and my friend spent $160 between the two of us we had 6 beers...we left a tip and walked out after an hour and 15 minutes. ..the bartender chased after us and told me I didn't spend enough money gambling so I owed a tab of $10.50 for 3 beers!....wtf..my office has their holiday party there every December with 30 to 40 people eating and drinking. ...but he chases me down like a criminal for 10 bucks..WOW. ..never go to this establishment. ..thanks Ray b...for the terrible service!"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the no kids atmosphere. Sabrina is awesome."}
{"text":"Great food and good atmosphere. Highly recommend for just hanging out in there big comfortable chairs."}
{"text":"I visited timbers Friday late afternoon with family and friends. We had an amazing time. Lilly was our bartender. What can I say so attentive and helpful .so personable and funny. Made us feel like family. We will return here if only to see her. Atmosphere fun and welcoming. Food was good. Good time had by all definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Food was great Service was great Relaxing atmosphere Friendly servers Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. We come here whenever we r in town. Now that we live in Las Vegas this place will be a regular for us for sure. The waiting staff can be hit or miss but the amount of food and the price maks up for it."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, relaxing atmosphere. The perfect spot for a beer and a burger. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We have had great experiences every single time we have come to Timbers! Great service! Great food! Great happy hour deals! We have come for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night.  Always the same ! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Katie is amazing.  I just moved in to the area and she has been a definite bright spot.  I have been coming here the last few weeks when she works and will be coming back as long as she's there.  Employees like this are hard to find and are definitely an asset to the company.  Keep up the good work and the and the amazing customer service."}
{"text":"Love Timbers. My wife and I go there all the time for food, drinks, and pool. The waitress Danielle always remembers us and knows what our usuals are. It's what being a native vegan used to feel like. Convenient and quiet!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times over the past 365 days to meet buddies for this and that.  It's cozy and affords you the ability to chill out.  The bartenders display the perfect balance of attention.  Each time I have visited the bartenders shake hands and introduce themselves, and ask for my name.  This is how all local bar experiences should be but a majority fall short in this finer point of bar keeping.  I have never sat down down for the long haul but it could be easy to do here.  I have also never sampled the food at this location.  But if you looking for a place to check out ESPN while waiting for friend to talk shop with or looking to drop out for a minute..check into T-A and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I had a order set for pick up, got there, waited 25 minutes then they told me \"she's starting it now.\" Waited another 25 minutes (45 in all together) and it still wasn't ready so we left. That's horrible service, i obviously had it placed for pick up so i could get in and get out. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall. Customer service on point and the food was delicious. Great happy hour 2 for 1 special  from 4pm-7pm Monday-Friday definitely will return."}
{"text":"Was in yesterday while in the neighborhood.  At first I thought the day bartender had some kind of disorder???    Nope she just loved to roll her eyes and treat us as if they were pure garbage she had to wait on. I'm sorry I wasn't dressed maybe as I normally would be, I  had done yard work all morning and just got out of the pool.  If u want to take a break on your day off and spend some cash to be treated like shit, head on down there. Another full of herself day bartender awaits. Hope your eyes don't get stuck."}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible food. The bartender thinks he is awesome but will yell at you for not tipping him enough. DO NOT GO HERE! The waitress ended her shift by getting wasted at the bar and screaming at customers. STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Bartenders look busy with an empty bar but still took me 10 min. To get a drink.  Patrons are more the drink and gamble type vs social and fun."}
{"text":"Came in to timbers to have dinner with friends. Our waitress Kylie seemed annoyed from the second we sat down. We placed our order and she didn't even bring out our appetizers until our food was out. She threw down our food and then dropped the check saying she needed to get out of here fast so she could finish up and go home. After 5 mins she came back to our table and said can I take your check. When we said no, she rolled her eyes. After another 10 mins she asked if we were finished because she really wanted to go home early. Then we asked for a dessert menu and she laughed and said \"no we don't have one\", \"why does everyone ask me that\",? After that she continued to tell us she was so excited to go home. Then she insulted my friends and I by calling one of them my mother when we are friends and close in age. Which was an uncalled for comment. Once she took our bill she returned with it and proceeded to tell us what you needed to tip her and that we should tip her more. When I asked for a small box, my friend giggled, just because she giggles a lot. The server then proceeded to tell us how she experimented pot and how her email address was inappropriate. She kept making references to narcotics? I love Timbers, and their food! I don't want this girl ruining others experiences when they go there. I am very disappointed in how we were treated. All of us at the table have worked or does work in the food service Industry and just shocked of how poorly the service was we received. I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"So I'm sitting here at the bar and Ray is on top of things.  When I walked into the bar, he was busy with another guest but as soon as he was done he walked over and introduced himself to me using his name which I thought was really cool! I've been here for about an hour and he seems to know all the regulars and is very attentive to everyone's needs.   Ray also informed me about the Timber App and the rewards program to save 20bucks on or after my 8th visit just buy downing loading the app.   I could go on and on about how great my visit is but I want to get back to my Long Island he made that is the best I've had since I moved from St. Louis.  I will return for another visit and I hope my experience is as great as this one is.     Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Good service. Great prices. Best happy hour. Lots of parking. The cinco de mayo specials were well worth it. Large organic margarita for $5 and huge chicken quesadilla for $8."}
{"text":"Waitress had ok service but getting less than an ounce of low quality scotch in a cup that you pay $5.50 for is ridiculous for this environment. It's a bar for old people, not a club. We come often in a group, spend good money, and always tip well. Seemed like the drinks started off small and only got smaller. Won't be going to Timbers again. We will take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's your average neighborhood bar. But the service is very good. The employees are very friendly. I would recommend it as a place to hangout."}
{"text":"A happy hour from 4-7pm and after midnight with $2.50 well drinks is a place for me! I came here on a weeknight with a couple friends and we enjoyed a pitcher of Blue Moon and a couple cocktails. The the vodka crans were served in a huge glass which was well worth it. I don't live in town, so I am always happy to discover a good place to get a cheap drink in Vegas! There are comfortable chairs and two pool tables. Our server even gave us our first game of pool for free! I'll definitely be back when I'm in town and need a chill spot to catch up with my friends."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and Katie in particular.  I've been going to this Timbers for quite some time because they have amazing chicken fingers and happy hour from 4-7pm on weeknights.  Who doesn't love reasonably priced drinks to go along with delicious chicken fingers?  The service had always been hit or miss, but the food was worth coming back for.  Ever since Katie has been waiting on me, the service has improved to outstanding.  Great food and great service.  What's not to love about this place?"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast. Coffee was served luke warm. My wife's pancakes tasted sour. Server didn't really seem to care when we complained. My chicken fried steak was pretty good, but nothing special. We generally like Timbers for drinks and dinner items, but they failed on this morning. Probably won't be going back to this one, especially for breakfast."}
{"text":"Bartender George is awesome! Really like the staff here and have had really decent breakfast here a couple of times. Always hot and fresh food. George never lets my beer hit empty before I have another ice cold Fat Tire sitting in front of me. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place is the worst timbers they have the worst customer service ever even the manager i will never come here again bad bad customer service.."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for some breakfast and it was on point!  Kevin, the bartender, was very entertaining and friendly. Will be back again. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Danielle is the only reason I go here, she is the best waitress ever! The bartenders are not so great, I sat at the bar gambling for about 30 minutes and was NEVER asked if I wanted a drink, Raymond walked passed us about 6 times with empty cups and never acknowledged us at all."}
{"text":"Some of the food was good. The timber fries are awesome. Don't get the bacon cheeseburger nachos if you just like chips and lettuce then yeah get them you will love them. Our server Khala started off good but then service went down the toilet. We asked for a to go box she brought it to us then she talked to her co-worker for 15 mins then she finally decides to bring me the check leave and go back to talk to the co-worker for another 15 mins. Then when we were trying to get an explanation about the bill she got a little attitude and got very defensive. This used to be my favorite neighborhood 49er bar but might have to explore other options."}
{"text":"Pretty good service, nice atmosphere, and the food was great! I had the peanut butter burger, and it was absolutely delicious! Nice place to have in the neighborhood, and I look forward to more visits in the future."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good food, very friendly staff. During football season Jamie always sets me up with a drink and my preferred NFL game."}
{"text":"We always call in for pick up orders and the girls that answer are very nice. Always super yummy ESPECIALLY the chicken fried steak and eggs!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place. The service and food was excellent over a year ago.  Unfortunately it has changed.  Unfriendly,  unwelcome feeling.  One particular male bartender ruined our happy experience.  :-("}
{"text":"I love this place. Very cozy atmosphere with oversized chairs. Always have super friendly service and OMG you have to try the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon. It's to die for!!!! I hate going to bars because of the cigarette smell but I don't have that problem here. They also have a pool table if you want to play. Noise level is low so you can carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"I always forget about this place when I'm hungry. I shouldn't. Great food. Great staff and they they have Shiner Bock on tap. Make sure you try the Timbers fries. It's their version of animal fries. Great place."}
{"text":"We were looking for a local, fun but quiet sports bar. Timbers on Azure fits the bill perfectly for us. Good food, cold beer and  great service without the loud rowdy background of some sports bars. Danielle and Heather are great servers, personable, fun and fast. The bar is quick with the drinks and it is an all adult atmosphere. Becoming our local hangout."}
{"text":"PLease  on one thing..... Use a detergent to clean those tables we are eating on!!!!.... Always so sticky sitting down ..."}
{"text":"Katelyn is AMAZING!! She always knows when to stop back at the table, excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"I had previously put in a yelp for Timbers because I was very disappointed with the food . I recently got a response from Brian G. That took over the kitchen asking me to please come back in and give him a chance.  Well I did and WOW he personality came out and met with us and the food was absolutely amazing. Thank yoy for reaching out to me.And we will definitely be back in . Thank you very much Brian.  He truly cares. Your new friends Cheri and her sisters....."}
{"text":"This is the closest Timbers to my place so I have been here a few times for lunch and a few times for dinner.   It is a nice place for me it has usually been more on the quiet side, but it has some great comfortable seating with spacious tables for plenty of food and drinks.  The staff has always been great for me here, always coming around just enough but not too much to see if we need new drinks or whatnot.  As has been stated, it is a chargers bar and the foods decent for a pub/bar and the prices are not bad."}
{"text":"We came here by chance we tried the burgers they were fantastic delicious tasty fat pieces of bacon on top of a blue cheese Burger who could ask for more waitresses were very attentive and the food was awesome 5 stars plus plus plus"}
{"text":"We don't come here often but when we do it's just  OK , nothing special. Speaking of specials our new waitress said there has never been a lunch special which is honestly false!!!! My Barbecue Chicken salad was flavor lacking to say the least. The cook put hardly any sauce on it and it just looked like a sad salad. I wanted to know if they had croutons or garlic bread to accompany my salad. The waitress came back with a piece of toasted sandwich bread with butter on it and said it was their version of garlic bread , oh and it cost $2.00. I felt pressured to accept it as it was brought to me already however, their was no garlic taste at all and not to mention it cost more than a loaf of bread. The service was not good at all. Our waitress kept stopping at the bar and socializing while at the same time forgetting about us. When I would ask her things she would just smurk at me and I didn't know what the heck that meant... But lo and behold when it was the end of our meal and time to pay our waitress turned into \"SUPER WAITRESS\" and began working hard for that tip...Sorry Hun, you have to be SUPER WAITRESS throughout our whole freakin meal to earn a good tip and afterall it is your job. I don't care to ever return...."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Timber when we first moved up to Northwest.  The waitress was lovely, showed us how to download their app so that we would get notifications about specials etc.  We both had burgers and they were excellent. So we the drinks! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great food. I love the no kids element. :) Sabrina is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Go somewhere else! Bartenders ignore you unless you are gambling. Food takes forever to come out."}
{"text":"The food was disappointing. We had cold breakfast potatoes and bland gravy. The game day drink specials were good however. Avoid the food!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious my husband enjoyed his bacon cheese burger and my salad was perfect. The waitress and staff was attentive and we were served quickly. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Timbers, especially this one! Wether your coming in to start the night or stumbling in to finish the night off. This Timbers always hits it off right! Always great prices and good chicken fingers! Burgers are also pretty good."}
{"text":"Good bar food, friendly staff, not near the main streets but it can get busy on week nights.  They always have some type of food & drink special happening.  San Diego Chargers bar during football season, every Timbers sponsors a different team.  Also a gaming bar, with smoking."}
{"text":"Angus sliders was delish,simple but satisfyingly good,fries not greasy and just enough. The beer was a dark type beer can't remember the name of it. All in all this is a come back place for us, gets a  4 stars from us."}
{"text":"Went here last night to watch my Zags win their game against the Broncos.  Large space, many large screen TV's, pool tables and video gaming.  The menus has good variety for a bar.  Waitstaff very pleasant.  Uniforms clean and attractive.  Much better than casual dress.  The only down side was not adequate air filtering for non-smokers itwas a big neg for me.  I moved twice due to inconsiderate smokers.  It really suppressed the good vibe of the establishment.  That's why the rating."}
{"text":"Just had dinner and our Food was delicious. Had the N.Y. Steak sandwich and fries and the steak sauce they used gave it a different but delicious flavor. Our waitress Katie was super. Friendly and Professional about her job. For the cost you can't ask for more."}
{"text":"We went to breakfast with another couple.  The breakfast was very good.  Portions were good.  the breakfast potatoes were excellent.  The service was great."}
{"text":"The service was great.. Bartender was friendly and attentive... Who the hell microwaves nachos anymore??? Does the cook think they are in a dorm room.... Good beer, TIGHT machines and aweful food... No surprise there are 8 people here on a Saturday night!!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and bartenders were rude. We sat at the bar and waited over 10 min to get service, and then got told if you are not gambling we have to leave the bar. Food was ok, overall performance was poor and they need a work over and maybe a customer service class.  Sorry, hopes this bar would be better, but it is worse then the typical on the corner bar."}
{"text":"This place is the worst What's bar runs out of chardonnay Short staff service not good Waited to long for food I will never come back"}
{"text":"Great food, and friendly staff. It is nice to walk in and be greeted but not hounded. Plenty of sports action on the Tvs, menu specials are reasonably priced."}
