{"text":"I have been coming to the Horizon Room at SunBird for years, and I can honestly say service and food have never been better. Open to the public, not just members of this resort community, the Horizon Room has great breakfasts, including a breakfast buffet on Sundays, and an ever-changing evening menu. Standard lunch fare offered throughout the week includes sandwiches and salads."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch at a good price with great views from the dining area of the golf course.  Friday night all you can eat fish fry is the best in town.  Friendly staff and good food!"}
