Honestly, it was a hit with the entire family. I'm typically not a big fan of thick crust pizza, but I have to say this one was delicious. We tried one of their specialties, the rapini and sausage, which was extremely flavourful and very unique, as well as the mushroom, also delicious. We also got a tasting of their freshly made doughnuts and French fries. 

The only downside was the wait time, since everything is made fresh, we waited for quite some time and let's face it, it was not the healthiest of meals. Oh well, it was worth it!"}
{"text":"It was the best find, with the best thick crust pizza I have ever had. Enough said. All the details were perfect, home made sause, dough, italian sausage....Spicy oil. They even made us house donuts. We really felt like we were at a family's home. I'm now looking for reason to be in RDP just to go back. If you are near by Stop in for sure."}

-the crust is crispy and delicious.

-their cheese is a little.bit different than usual

-lots of toppings

-the only little nit pick would be the sauce is a little bit too light for me.

-prices are reasonable"}
