{"text":"Ordered chili... We were informed when the remainder of the food was served that the chili was all gone... Then the medium rare burger was delivered well done and the server stated he would let the manager know... The check arrived without concession and no managerial follow up. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I wish we had spent the extra time an drove to Dave and Busters. The food was average at best and the games are very dated. I don't think they have updated the arcade in 10 years.   Spend a few extra minutes and drive someplace else that has games. My 8 year old was bored after $10."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, and it seems to be even more exciting than it was as the Boneyard! Much more willing to take my kids to a place like this, and it seems much cleaner and brighter than it did before! The only thing that you should know is to have a firm price limit for your kids (and yourself!), because I know that I could've easily spent at least $50 on games in the arcade alone--it's that great! Great staff as well--very friendly and helpful! Love this place and would recommend it for small parties for kids and families for sure!"}
{"text":"The staff that waited on my table were awesome! I had the Chicken & Waffles...it tasted good. The waffle could've been fluffier and crisper but had a good taste. They give you two small beasts and top it with one wing ding. The wing ding I had wasn't cooked thoroughly. I informed the waitress and she apologized and went to get the manager. The manager came over and said that the wing looked ok to him and that's how it usually looks and that he used to work at the wing house and the wings always looked like that. Then he said he would replace it if I wanted him too. That's terrible customer service. I didnt ask for your opinion or what should this look like. I am a chicken conniseur! Don't try to convince me to eat your partially cooked yard bird! Cuz if I get salmonella poisoning from eating that, there goes your job! So next time, if a customer doesn't like the way their food looks how about you try saying this \"I'm Sorry sir/maam. Let me get you another one.\" I'll let you borrow that approach......And it is for this foolishness, you get 3 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for drinks and some games. Our drinks (crown and coke for me and a beer for him) came to $17.00 and with a tip was pretty much $20.00 for two drinks. That is absurd in my opinion. We went to play some games and were disappointed to see that not once, not twice, but three times on three different games our card swiped and points came off, but the game didn't work. Also, the roof was leaking. Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, limited menu, poor quality food. Poor in comparison to the prior establishment (The Boneyard). Not at all worth the trip. I went with the Pulled pork sandwich, smothered in sauce and coleslaw to cover up the stale tough pork which tasted like it was a week old and reheated several times over the last few days. Fries an extra 4 dollars, worthless. Most beers $7 , wine $8 a glass."}
{"text":"We had pizza, wings, mac n cheese and the fried chicken sandwich. They were edible, but not good. My kids like this place for the games, but don't come hungry."}
{"text":"I had a SUPRISE 50th for my mom at Play this month. I worked with Stephanie, AM and Party Coordinator. She was very professional and generous. There are many menu options that you can chose from. The OVERALL experience was AWESOME. I extremely consider having a party here for any aged individual. The food is also amazing. Thanks so much to the whole team that helped make my moms party a great SUCESS.   Ashley"}
{"text":"We went for dinner with the kids on a saturday so we did have to wait for a table, but once the kids saw the arcade that was not a problem! The place is fun and bright and the game cards are easy to use.  We bumped into some friends there too who said they had to reload the game cards so the adults could play!  Our table was ready on time and everyone found something they liked to order.  The kids had pizza and chicken fingers and I had a chicken sandwich and a side salad.  The food was fresh and delicious and the service was great.  My kids have already asked to go back - this will definitely be on our list for a great family night!"}
{"text":"We go all the time, the food is always excellent and the wait staff is very attentive. The games could use an update but we still have a great time when we go."}
{"text":"What a fantastic re-design. The new menu destroys what was there before. The staff was spot on from start to finish. Try the philly rolls and the sweet potato fries. I found the prices where spot on for the caliber of food and drink we were being served. (I mean come on, if you can't afford it Applebee's is right down the street). The gaming area was filled with people laughing and having a great time. I found the game room staff to be as helpful as my sever. I highly recommend This restaurant if you find yourself in the mayfield area!"}
{"text":"Thank God! The owners of \"Flip Side\" finally opened close enough for me to be able to walk to get my beloved sweet potato fries. Did that seem a little creepy? Yeah. It did to me too but I don't care. These guys know how to make a mean burger and the sweet potato fries are legen....wait for it unless you are lactose intolerant.....dary. The food and service were great. I didn't check out the games but I'll do that next time. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had a party here for our son and overall the kids had fun and the food was good.  With one of the pros being that they had good prizes that were within realistic ticket values.  Unfortunately we paid for a party that had poor service, the manager was good but the server assigned to our party was a horrible server that had a bad attitude and knew that he was going to get an automatic 20% gratuity even though he could have earned more.  We would definitely take our kids here again but not for a party with what we paid we expected better service"}
{"text":"Play is a welcomed and much needed addition to the Mayfield area. The atmosphere and menu feels more like you're somewhere on East 4th St or in Treemont instead of the Mayfield Road strip. Great mixed drink list --- no 20 oz plastic cups filled with warm Bud Light lining the bar here. The food is excellent and very reasonably priced. The arcade area and the dining/bar area are well divided, so it's more like two different types of places in one. And best of all the service is fantastic and everyone working there is friendly and outgoing. I'd recommend Play over any other restaurant with a bar in the area."}
{"text":"Food is improved over when it was BoneYard -- albeit with a much smaller menu and smaller portions.  \"Play\" area is good enough to have some fun for an hour or so after your meal."}
{"text":"A spin off of a Dave and Busters atmosphere without the price tag and a good selection of quality food. Burgers are excellent. An actually fresh cooked burger with cut French fries. Drink prices are fair and I saw they have a happy hour that's half off. Came here for a bachelor party and we had a blast with the games!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice since they've opened and do not have a single complaint! The food is always delicious, especially the milkshakes! Everything is reasonably priced for the quality that you receive! A great experience with friendly service!"}
{"text":"This review is only for the arcade area.  It is ok.  It didn't change much from the old Boneyard.  It still looks and feels separated from the restaurant.  I wish it had a more integrated look and feel.  I hear the food is really good and it was packed the night we were there."}
{"text":"What a fun place!  Our food was great.  Seriously the best fries I have ever had...great seasoning. My boys both had burgers...the server didn't ask for what temp they wanted so they came out well done. I had the fried chicken sandwich. The house made hot sauce was awesome.   Our server was pleasant and helped with recommendations.   The games though not as many as Dave and Busters were more than plentiful. The game room was very clean even with all the sticky kid hands. The prizes were decent and a better value than similar establishments."}
{"text":"I love this place it's a great spot for family and friends to relax. They have great food with a ton of games to play. It really is an adult playground. Affordable prices with a great atmosphere. I definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I have to say I am always surprised with this place.  It looks like it is going to be over priced and not very good.  Kind of the industrial feel I guess.  But the service and food are always great.  Menus selection is simple and interesting.  Quality is top notch.  Love the Onion Rings and the Fried Chicken sandwich.  Burgers have always been great.  Price is set to keep you coming back and not getting sticker shock.  They have a great 1/2 price drinks happy hour (5 - 7) I believe.    The games run the span from kids to adults.  You are there to play and the tickets are skimpy.  So that is kind of a downer, but if you just focus on playing and having fun, it is a great time."}
{"text":"Our salads, and Mac and cheese were great! Overall experience good. However, we didn't enjoy the noisy, small bar area with kids running through, while some kids at bar for refills on their\"lemonade.\"Nice updates!! Think they should of left it The Boneyard with facelift. Managers very nice."}
{"text":"Abysmal. Ugggh.  Disappointing food.  Alcohol should be easy to do well.  At least an average job should be done with dispensing of alcohol.  Wait staff isn't even interesting or alluring."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Food okay. Video Games ok, they are slightly dated. But still fun. Good bar with decent selection of beers. Staff is very nice. Big redo on the inside. They are going to have a music venue and upstairs banquet area. That'll be cool.   Good place for a few hours to eat and goof around. Not as cool as Dave&Busters but it's not trying to be. Worth a try."}
{"text":"The food and beer is overpriced like crazy. I ordered an appetizer and was so disappointed with it I left.   I will give them this, their game room looks fun but it appears that they are paying for all that extra space with the markups on their menu. $4 for a bottled beer, $7.50 for a $1 taco from taco bell... If I had kids, and also too much money, I'd come here to spend it and not give a damn. Not for me."}
{"text":"What is with all the negative reviews? Happy hour is the time to be here and start off your dinner. You can't beat half price drinks. Not to mention their beer list has a lot of craft beers....since when are craft beers cheap. Food was delicious! Majority of our table ordered burgers and not a single complaint. Everyone was in love with their meal! I had even asked my server to leave off the garden from the burger, and she remembered which most places don't listen. Games were exciting, I got feel like a kid again and truly enjoy myself for a great price. Don't listen to the negativity and go in with an open mind. Thanks for such a great night!"}
{"text":"Good for a first try by probably not a second  Just play somewhere else if you are an adult who likes good Well priced food    Good for parents who want to escape for a second while the kids play  Just have  to pay a hefty price"}
{"text":"Stopped in a few nights ago (apparently 2nd day it was opened) and was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, decor and amazing food. Was expecting to hear items were frozen and fried but was told everything is made fresh daily. Burger and onion rings were amazing! Took a quick tour of the place and noticed a great selection of video games and other options like bowling and sports games."}
{"text":"Food was average @ best, nothing special. Service is slow. Cesar salad was nasty, inedible. Kids meal was ok. Games was nothing special, just average. Good value with the Groupon, otherwise not really worth it."}
{"text":"We found this place on Groupon. Purchased the Groupon...and I gotta say I was very pleased with everything! The food was really good and everything was nice and hot. Games were fun and reasonable,server was great as well!"}
{"text":"Stoped here for a drink on saturday for the first time. At first i thought the cocktail menu was pretty decent with the options and the prices. I ordered the pinapple margarita special. It would have been pretty good if she didnt pour a bunch of sweet grenadine into it which really over powered the whole drink. My boyfriend ordered the salty dog which was supposed to have fresh grapefruit juice but the grapefruit was from giant eagle. my friend ordered a moscow mule that was supposed to have buckeye vodka and fevertree ginger beer had absolut and goslings.... this place was just overall disappointing."}
{"text":"nice and bright inside.  Allot of updated games. The food was much better then a chuck e cheese. Really good with full bar even better. Nice tvs around place.  They could be positioned better. Had problem with game. Got a manager but all good.  She was very nice to deal with. We had great service not just from our server but the server next to him.  We will come back. Traveled with 3 11 year old girls."}
{"text":"The staff really makes this establishment shine! From the moment you walk to the door, one of the hostesses opens the door for you and greets you right away! Such a nice touch that most businesses don't think of these days. Very fun place for kids and parents alike! The arcade area is rather large and very clean for how many kids are in and out. Great beer selection for parents too!"}
{"text":"The cost of the food was great I was about to get some chicken and waffles for under $15 and I was full after the service was great the bar tender was helpful keep the time and let us know happy hour was almost over I was very happy with my service the next time I'm in Cleveland I will be going back thank you!"}
{"text":"I'll only add that they can throw a great party. Kim was running the show for the grand opening of there new stage room. She really did her thing plenty of tasty food and champagne. The dj and decor really set the mood on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Visited Play for my boyfriend's birthday last week. Ordinarily I am very turned off by 'arcade' places but this place has a really great atmosphere. The walls are very simplistic and white- VERY different from the boneyard. The food was surprisingly good! We all got burgers and everyone I was with really liked theirs. My only gripe was with our server who disappeared after the food was dropped. We were told that she was 'on her break.' Weird! Then when we got the check it was the wrong check- and when we got our real check, gratuity was added even though we were only a party of 4. This whole snafu took almost as long as the meal. Anyways, the games were fun and the food was decent so we'll be back. Oh! And the games! So fun! Careful though- they charge you PER game card you get so make sure to save yours for a return trip."}
{"text":"we did not come here for the games, we stopped in for carry out only after work. We found this place using the Yelp app. First, customer service is 5 stars. Second, food, not that good :( Asked for our burger med-rare and it was well done. Fried chicken sandwich was very dry on the outskirts and 50% of the fried chicken breast. It was creepy dead inside, yet again, the staff was very pleasant and helpful. We don't live on the east side so we do not understand the pull of a \"dave and busters\" here. Just went  for take out after work. 2 stars on food, 5 stars on service. Will not go back"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to dine here based on the mixed reviews but it is not far from my work and I was starving. I was beyond satisfied! I sat at the bar since I was just by myself. I like the atmosphere here. I didn't play games but it looked like there was a small but decent selection. The bartender was very sweet and attentive. I ordered the mushroom burger and substituted a turkey burger for a regular burger with sweet potato fries. The burger took a little long but it was well worth the wait. It was amazing! The 2 fried shiitake mushrooms on top were my favorite part. I suggest adding an appetizer with just those and the garlic mayo. Woowwww Yummm! The turkey burger is hand pattied and was not tough or dry like other places I have tried. Not as good as my work place tho, they still have the gold star. The sweet potato fries were perfect! Nice and crispy with great flavor. No dipping sauce needed. Everyone who knows me knows how much I love my sweet potato fries and I am very critical but these were top notch. I will definitely be back! Thank you play arcade I am recommending this place to my family and friends!"}
{"text":"I had the best experience at Play Arcade. (Think Dave and Busters but better.) I was lured there by a Groupon and will definitely be back. We sat at the bar and ordered our food on a Sunday afternoon. The food was great. I had the fried chicken sandwich and the bf had chicken and waffles. We both loved our dishes. There was a slight problem with my order. The manager personally took care of it and treated us to extra credits on our game card...without being asked to do it. Fantastic! Other managers around CLE could learn from that. I thought it was handled beautifully! We spent an extra $20 in credits Bc of this alone!  The games themselves were decent. They ranged from Dance Dance revolution to a trivia game to skeeball and basketball to typical arcade games. Some of the games allow you to accrue credits to spend in the store. The games were also not crowded and ppl were pretty nice about sharing machines. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Came on Saturday 11/4 with a few friends and our kids. Waited about 10-20 min for a table. Food was good, mostly had burgers, chicken sandwiches, and some kids meals. Service was terrible. Long waits for drinks, food took about an hour. She rang up our bills wrong, was told there was no kids chicken finger meal, so ordered chicken fingers and a side of fries. What did they bring to our table?  A kids chicken finger meal and then a seperate order of chicken fingers and a side of friends. Then when we mentioned it when they were putting the food down she said nothing, just ignored the fact that we were apparently displeased."}
{"text":"After hearing the food here was just average I was pleasantly surprised :) very good service and our food came out quickly. Everything seemed to be homemade rather than frozen. We loved the onion rings, play burger and chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight since it's been play...such a downfall this place took..I remember when this place was busy all the time..the back patio was awesome as was the main Bar. We went tonight just to give it a chance...got there at 8 on patio had a couple people join...we were quickly told the kitchen was closing at 9 and to get any orders in. I mean 9pm really?!?!? Who ever redid this place ruined it...it was somewhere everyone wanted to be at one point in time..sad...also mac n cheese was awful. The sweet potato fries were great tho! And the fried green beans ehhhh they were ok."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with a small group last night and was underwhelmed. Service was great and everyone liked their food (except me - there's nothing remotely vegan on the menu so I had a glass of water), but...something is missing in this bar/restaurant/arcade. I'd been to The Boneyard multiple times and was always impressed by how big it was and how vibrant the decor was (until it got kind of run down before it closed) This place is tiny compared to the former Boneyard space. I'd say 2/3 of the old space is closed off by beige colored walls. There's no stage anymore and it looks like there's no access to the really nice back patio that the Boneyard used to have. It honestly looks very unfinished unless they're going for a hospital chic look.   The arcade itself is very disjointed and kind of small. They do have 2 bowling machines with real alleys which seems neat, but...nothing else seemed that different. (I think most of the machines were recycled from the Boneyard, honestly)  This bar/restaurant was a-ok, but I'll be in no rush to go back since there are so many other bars in the area.   P.S. Important to note is that the front door is now near Mayfield road and not behind the building."}
{"text":"What a great place for a date night! I came here on a Tuesday evening so not many people were there since it was a week day. My girlfriend and I went on a double date with her friends who told us about this place. It was so much fun!   I'm from Pittsburgh so we made the drive out to see what this arcade was about. It was well worth the drive. My girlfriend and I both got 20 bucks on our game card and it lasted us over an hour of play. We ended up not eating there, so I can't say much about the food but the games alone were reason to go here. We ended up getting kicked out because we lost track of time so quickly.   Also, the tickets electronically go onto your game cards so you don't have to worry about carrying the tickets around and losing them. That was a nice addition to this place."}
{"text":"We were going to give a three but after reading the other reviews we realized how much of a disappointment it really was. The food and service were average but the worst part was the atmosphere. What were they thinking? Like the other reviewers said, they're only using a small portion of the building. It all feels like they ran out of money and decided to open anyway. The game rooms are weirdly shaped and small as are the dining areas. So much for the hype. Take my advice and go to BW3 for wings and beer or Dave and Busters (it's worth the drive) for games with your kids."}
{"text":"Love going to play with my 3 stepsons. They love the games and the made from scratch food is amazing. I highly recommend it for families or just stopping in for a few drinks with friends. Glad to see the changes with remodel."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Play twice now, both times I tried different burgers and they were great. The first time the fries were far better, the second they were a bit soggy which is a huge bummer because they were really good during my initial visit. The BBQ sauce has a unique flavor, and I tried the chicken fingers (strips?) and they were a solid choice as well. And by tried, I mean I stole one off my friend's plate...  The best thing about the experience, however, was the milkshake. AMAZING. If you stop here, make sure you leave room (or get one to go!), you won't regret it. Overall I think Play is a cool spot, unfortunately it never seems very busy...hopefully that's just due to the time of day I pass by. Solid 4-stars."}
{"text":"I read the negative reviews.....And they were kind of spot on. We were seated right away. But waited 20 minutes for water which we wanted lemons for but since bare hands had touched them we passed on them. I really wanted to leave but my girlfriend was hungry and the weather was too bad to go elsewhere since \"Play\" is close to home we decided to stay and try to make the best of the night. Most of the time when before I go out to eat I look over the menu ahead of time so I know what I want. So the waiting for a long time gets unbearable. And the waitress that was going to be ours was walking around drinking soda. the Bar Tender served us after someone who may have been an off duty worker or mgr at the bar pointed out we had been neglected.    My Girlfriend ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was juicy & tender but under seasoned. The waffles were good it was something missing to push them over the top. The fries....were missing everything including heat.     I got the chicken Philly with onion rings. The rings and sauce that came with them were very tasty but the onions were pretty much raw Inside of the beer batter. The chicken Philly was OK . not really a chicken Philly but a grilled chicken sandwich. Chicken was juicy & tender could have used a tad more flavor.    The food and the bar tender saved this review from 1 star. I may come back but idk."}
{"text":"My husband and I held our rehearsal dinner at Play Arcade and Kitchen and it was a huge success.  Everyone had a blast and we heard it was the best rehearsal dinner anyone had been to.  The food was very good and the staff was all very friendly and patient as we had to kick out our guests from the room that we were past our time on.  The manager, Stephanie, went out of her way to put candles on the tables to add a romantic ambiance to the room and made sure our night was perfect.  We bought everyone video game cards and I am pretty sure the adults had just as much fun as all the children.  I highly recommend hosting a party at Play, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! My wife and I ordered the pizza and it was amazing! The bartender suggested we order it extra crispy and she was right on par! It was so fresh and the homemade sauce really hit the spot. We also ordered cheese fries as an app and you could tell the fries were hand cut and not frozen. The cheese sauce was also homemade too. We sat at the bar and received excellent service from the bartenders. They were so attentive to our needs and ensured our beverages were always full. If you have any doubts about going here based on the previous reviews written by others don't have any. It is an absolute blast and the game selections were also fun. We both liked the fact that all your tickets were kept track of electronically too. We will both be back again for sure. Definitely better than Dave and Busters and a lot closer for those of us that live near the Solon/twinsburg/beachwood area. Can't wait to try everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for a fundraiser on a Wednesday night- it Started out slow but the place got packed! Had awesome super cheap wine and some great chicken tenders. Will Come back again!"}
{"text":"I can only comment on the games since I didn't have food, but overall I had a great experience.   There are 80+ games to play, anywhere from traditional arcade games to prize games. I took a kid I nanny for on his day off school, and he had an absolute blast playing all of the games and racking up quite a few points for prizes. We went during half price games, and we spent $20 for a solid hour of nonstop games.   Their business model is similar to that of a Dave and Busters, but it's on a much smaller scale. You get a card (you have to pay $2 for a new card so make sure you keep it) and tokens get loaded onto that. Each game is anywhere from 4-8 tokens. I paid $20 for 110 tokens, which would last you about 30 minutes if you played nonstop.   For adults, there is a bar that I saw, but we didn't get food so I can't comment on that.   The only thing is several of their games were not working, including one that took our tokens, but besides that it was a very good experience. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"First of all, I like a burger and a beer more than just about anything in life. But I draw a line and completely abstain when these new places have a la carte pricing. A burger should include fries. Charge me $14 for a burger and fries, not $8 for a burger and  $6 for fries. Everybody knows how much potatoes cost! It's like wearing a big \"I'm an idiot\" dunce hat while eating dinner paying for $6 fries. Add that stuff in people! But I digress...Waitstaff was good. Food was completed average. Wife got a chicken sandwich and side salad. Both looked fine and as expected. I got a Caesar salad with chicken (see rant above) from the dinner salad menu. $12 when chicken was added. I thought they messed up and gave me a side Caesar salad the portion was so small. I asked (nicely, always) and the helpful waitress sought the owner without me asking and his only response was \"I'd be happy to get you something else but that salad would be more than I could eat.\" Wut? I'm an athletic 250 pound guy, he was a twiggy beanpole...who would say that? The salad was the same size as my wife's side salad.  I know that portions in America are out of whack and that I really don't need the 10,000 calorie salad that most places serve, but that is what I expect, and I bet I'm not alone. I just wanted some freaking filling  salad man, but I wasn't going to fork out $24 for what I get for $9 two blocks away at Applebees. So I'm sitting here hungry on my couch writing this after going to a new restaurant. How disappointing! Save yourself the frustration and eat elsewhere then go there to play games with your kids. You'll thank yourself."}
{"text":"My experience here was not good. I bought a groupon for $20 food and $10 play. We ordered chicken wings, corn dogs and pepperoni pizza. When the pizza came out it looked like the type that a kid would make in their kitchen. The dough was not cooked and it was gooey, it looked like a bag of sharp cheddar was spread on the dough and microwaved. The pepperoni was sausage which tasted like fried hotdogs. We immediately sent it back for not being cooked thoroughly. Then I took one bite of my chicken wing to see that the meat was still light pink and not cooked good. All we ate were the corn dogs(prior to tasting the pizza) and no longer had an appetite. The supervisor told us she could not do anything except let us use the $6 we had left on the Groupon. We used the $10 of play. There is not a large variety of games but it was fun, nonetheless. The atmosphere here is very nice but the food. As I walked out I spoke to the male manager about my experience who then compensated me with a $20 gift card for more play. I appreciated that he listened to my concern and he genuinely wanted to fix the mistake and make me happy."}
{"text":"Expensive drinks and beer. Service was nice bartender was helpful and tentative. Cool atmosphere kids would love it."}
{"text":"A really big drop off from the first time we came to this place.  Let's make a deal and the Kong Fu panda game were both broken.  Service was pretty good and the food was decent but many of the games which is the main reason we went to this restaurant were not working.   A focus on making sure the game experience is great is necessary for us to return again"}
{"text":"Been by this so many times that we decided to stop on a snowy Saturday around 2 p.m. Was pleasantly surprised. The venue is newer, and was the cleanest place I think I have ever been in.  Spotless!  Even the bathrooms. We started with a late lunch.  Wasn't busy so we got seated at a high-top right away. The server was professional and the food was delicious. We had checked the menu before we arrived, and it was spot on. The fried chicken sandwich with blue cheese was great....I substituted the fries for a nice salad.  The BBQ shredded pork sandwich was very good. My husband got the chicken Cobb salad, and said it was outstanding. Even the blueberry pie milk shake was delicious, but could have been a few ounces more for the price. We opted for no alcohol. Then we played the Arcade.  Fun! We were a middle age couple with our Millennial son, and we had a blast. Had a $20 game card that you slide--no tokens, and that's all we needed. Played skeet ball, basketball, drove race cars, played air hockey and a few other games. Lots of choices. And you can choose a prize. This place is perfect for a date night, or kids time, or just to eat, or just to play."}
{"text":"This place is nauseating. The food is very average. The staff is very nice however. The drinks were ok. It's loud, damn is it loud in here. The kids are having a ball spending $20 each every 15min. Been here an hour and I'm looking for a rope."}
{"text":"Here with the kid... it's a smaller Dave and buster great for the neighborhood. Good family restaurant and arcade!"}
{"text":"Unfriendly bartender. Felt as if we were not welcomed. Third time here. Unfriendliness behind the bar seems to be a regular occurrence. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Call it a smaller sized Dave and Buster's. One upside is they have a stage to host musical events. Did not try any of the food, but seemed ok from what my neighbors ordered. We came in for happy hour, which is offered EVERYDAY. Must also highlight a reverse happy hour on Friday and Saturday nights from 10-12pm with the same drink specials ($5 cocktails and $2-3 dollar beers). It was pretty empty when I went but it was a Monday night. Ample parking galore!!!"}
