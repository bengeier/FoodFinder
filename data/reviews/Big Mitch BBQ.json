{"text":"We used Big Mitch BBQ to cater an event at our church.  It was phenomenal.  He sat down with us and went over what our needs were, how many hungry carnivores we would be feeding, and what our budget was.  He then helped us add and cut to meat (get it) our needs.  The day of the event, he thought of every detail for serving, down to having toothpicks available for guests. The food was incredible.  From wings (best I've ever had) to sausage links, to pulled pork to brisket there is nothing we ate that the crowd didn't rave about.  I highly recommend Big Mitch for your BBQ and party needs."}
{"text":"Mitch catered our wedding reception and he did a perfect job. He even met with us prior and made great suggestions for the layout and some finishing touches. Very knowledgeable! My husband and I were stopped by several guests at the reception  inquiring about the caterer. Best beef ribs I have ever had! And the sauce, don't get me started. Mitch, thank you so much for making our event so special!"}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant,  it's a catering company!! Tried to go for lunch yesterday but the directions kept taking us to a neighborhood. That's when we found out it was a catering company.  The other reviews had me hungry!"}
{"text":"Big Mitch catered our company party and it was delicious.  And he made it so easy because he did it all from sodas to sides to amazing Q.  My favorite was his succulent brisket and Smokey wings.  Will definitely be calling him again.... Maybe for my family reunion....."}
{"text":"Mitch's BBQ is absolutely delicious.  And I can BBQ & smoke my own- but why would I?  Everything is amazing. Turkey, chicken, pulled pork, ribs-all decadent. The beans and other sides too, simply perfect.  I ate the leftovers for a week, no joke."}
{"text":"Right now we are at a solid one star. Mitch and the food were supposed to be here 12 minutes ago. Instead, I found an email telling me that he was delayed and people who have worked with him in the past will be to the party at 4:30 to set up the food. To be clear, that is 90 minutes after our agreed upon time. The party has started. The other reviews suggest that the food will be outstanding. However, I find that an insufficient consolation for such profound unprofessionalism. I will update my review if the food is, in fact, outstanding.

So, not outstanding. Pretty good - except the chicken thighs and sausage. And nothing was hot. Luke warm. Go with the pulled pork and ribs. Those are the best by far. Buy your own grocery store macaroni and potato salads. The woman who finally got here was very friendly."}
