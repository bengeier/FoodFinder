{"text":"Ok Darren, you were right. I was against comming to this gem of a place when you pushed me into it....and I love you even more for it!  When we first walked in I wasn't sure what I'd be in for. There was a strong smell of burnt potato in the air and few patrons. The menu was small, and I looked at Darren in a way that said \"all breakfasts are the same!\" Man was I proven wrong!   I ordered the biggest breakfast on the menu, as I was hungry, and am happy to report I left will a satisfied belly.  I have nothing to complaine about! From me, that is VERY rare (as my boyfriend can tell you). The toast was 2 very thick slices of the rye bread I ordered. I was also offered an apricot jelly! Sooo good! Everything was cooked (grilled) to perfection! The bacon wasn't burnt nor limp and greasy, and the homefries were perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft and steamy on the inside. I am very impressed that there was no residue from the grill in the food.   After chatting with the owners, I came to learn that they offer catering. The rates are on the website. I may very well have them cater for a bridal shower I have to throw for my friend.  Oh, and the iced tea is fresh brewed. BONUS!!!"}

{"text":"Note #1: This place was formerly known as Suzy's Cozy Corner Cafe. It has very recently changed hands; the former owner's daughter (and I assume her significant other) are currently in charge. It is now simply called The Cozy Cafe.   Note #2: This is their Facebook page...  https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Cozy-Cafe/153343761405541  Note #3: The Cozy Cafe also caters and is a BYOB establishment.   About 10 years ago, I swear I saw an ad for this restaurant on local TV and then forgot about it until the other day when I realized that they hadn't been Yelped yet.   So here we came for brunch, and what a banger of a brunch we chose from their brief (so far) menu.   I had their West End Breakfast Burrito and instantly fell in love with the eye-catching, neon red, artfully bisected tomato/basil wrap that held a juicy, happily filling medley of puffy scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, leafy lettuce, bacon strips (my choice), and tomatoes. Sitting alongside the burrito was a small dish of quality, freshly-made salsa that could have passed for a straightforward tomato vinaigrette salad . A plenteous serving of their superlative home-fries was only 50 cents (!) extra.   Kay got a Main Street Breakfast, which gets you 2 eggs, meat, and toast. I didn't try anything, but her plate of food was a beauty to behold.   Our total, including a tip that was over 20%, came to a whopping $18, virtually making The Cozy Cafe a charity!  The young couple that now runs The Cozy Cafe are energetic, positive, enthusiastic, and ambitious. They treated us like childhood friends, eagerly telling us about all of their big plans (a dinner menu is in the works along with outdoor dining and cook-offs!) with big smiles on their faces and big hearts on their sleeves. Go there, eat, and watch them grow along with the rest of the humble, unsung West End."}
