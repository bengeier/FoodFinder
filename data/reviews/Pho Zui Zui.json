{"text":"Pho dac biet  very tasty and authentic. Broth not very fatty  and didn't taste any msg. Can't wait to try their other Vietnamese soups like bun no hue next time."}
{"text":"Where to start? Oh yeah, once again, the positive reviews brought me here all the way from Laval on the hunt for the best Pho. Had to try it bcs one of them said that this place rivals the spots found on Côte-des-Neiges if not better, yes better, with their \"rich\" and flavourful broth. Whoop, voilà, the keyword Harry was looking for and to which he was sold on thinking he's on his way finding a hidden gem. 

I can give the overall place's cleanliness, modern looks and good service a 5 star. It has nothing to do with the dated decors and the mediocre service of the ones I've been to including my #1 spot Pho Ngon. But you know what? Within a minute after sitting down while waiting for my soup to arrive, some strange feeling inside told me this is not what \"authentic\" looks like. It's too modernish, too clean, waiter too nice.... May be I got too used to slurping Pho at not so fancy places that gives them their special allure? 

Now onto the Pho which supposedly is \"rich\". With big enthusiasm, I let my nose do the judging of the meat in there. Any fowl smell? Nope, all smelling normal and a bit bland. Hek, it's good to go, I'm hungry. I dig my spoon in there to taste the broth first. Hmmm, must've been the wrong spot of the bowl because \"rich\" did certainly not knock on my tastebuds. Ok, let's try the north side of the bowl, nope not there either. Perhaps southeast and then southwest of the bowl? No, no and no anywhere! \"Rich\" did not come with my soup, instead, I got a watered down lower middle class version of the \"rich\" with a hint of Pho. What? Grrrr, those cunning reviews again!!

So conclusion, if you prefer your Pho on the mild side with less pronounced broth, yeah, it's a good clean place to try if you happened to be around the neighbourhood of West Island. For me tho, it was not worth the drive. I'd rather eat at either Nguyen Phi or Pho Ngon. Cheers."}
{"text":"This is a small storefront operation.  The proprietors are welcoming and the food is just that much better than comparable operations.  I'm not much for writing reviews, so I will just say i enjoyed the experience and I will go back.  I recommend that you do too."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and very tasteful. The restaurant is very clean. The service could be a bit improved and more friendly."}
{"text":"What a find, the pho hear rivals the usual suspects like the spots on Cote de Neiges. I'd say even better, the broth is rich without being too salty or fatty, a large bowl is more than enough for a meal. The family was very friendly and the place was packed at lunch. Will definitely visit when I'm in the area again. I was told the spring rolls are made in house, those were excellent too."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic, food and very tasty spicy sauce !!!!
Generous servings !!!

We'll be back !!!"}
{"text":"Surprising great find! Delicious pho....super reasonable. Ate beef pho and other diners in party ate the chicken pho. Broth is superb and service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Very good service! Good & real tasty pho cuisine!
Amazing staff. 
I know its newly opened restaurant... i hope they wont change. All the very best to them!"}
{"text":"This is a family owned restaurant! The place offers excellent service and the owners are very nice, The pho soup is out of this world!!!. I have to get my fix every week. The owner prepares the broth every day and you can tell the products used are fresh and are very good quality. The dumplings / crispy noodles are also at the top of my list. I have been to many viet restaurant and this one is by far my favorite one. Try it at your own risk because after that you are going to need to go back all the time!

{"text":"Amazing food. Have been there two times and they have not disappointed. Portions are generous and delicious."}
{"text":"Fast service, delicious food. When I call in a take away order, it's ready in 10 minutes. I absolutely love Pho, & Pho Zui Zui doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I was in the West Island and suddenly had a crave for Pho so I did a little Yelp research and found this little place.

It looks like family business, it reminds me of how most restaurant businesses are in Vietnam, especially the local ones around the neighborhood.

So I ordered my usual combination: Pho Dac Biet, imperial rolls, iced coffee but this time... I added something that not all pho place has... Vietnamese fried dumplings.

Imperial rolls : I'd say... OK. Not bad, not spectacular either... I just felt the pastry is a little too much and it covers all the taste of the filling inside of the rolls.

Vietnamese fried dumplings, this one though... Wow, very tasty... Crispy on the outside, the filling should be the same of very similar to the imperial rolls and it's so much better! A must try!!

Pho : in my opinion there's one characteristic that will make any pho much better... Boiling hot and their soup is boiling hot when it arrives, it smell so good that I couldn't resist to take a sup of it even though I knew it will burn my tongue. Lol unfortunately, I find it rather missing a bit of flavour... Just that little flavour... Too bad.

The service is great, like I said, a family business, foods are served quickly with a respectful quality and very reasonable price!

Will go again PHO sure next time!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Its location is a little bit hidden. You might have a hard time spotting it since its surrounded by other businesses. Inside is very clean but doesn't have much decor. Looks very plain but the food makes up for that!

FOOD: Very good. And they give you such a big portion! I personally loved it. I just found my new go-to spot whenever I want pho in the West Island. The soup was yummy and the meat was so tender. I would definitely recommend others to come here.

PRICE: Prices are very affordable. Plus, for the quality and quantity that you're getting, you're not gonna find anything better in the West Island.

SERVICE: The staff is very friendly and fast. It's a family business so the daughters work as well and are super sweet. I sincerely wish them success and I hope that they remain the same loving people."}
{"text":"Went twice in 3 days. This place is good. Once again I ordered food for pick up. Was reminding myself all the way home to take pictures. But once I got home and laid out all the food, I forgot to take photos. I blame the food. It's just too good. Now I will have to go back :)"}
