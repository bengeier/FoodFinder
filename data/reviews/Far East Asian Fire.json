{"text":"Bad. Bad. Bad. We had orange chicken that was a mush of panko bread crumbs (~70%) and a few pieces of chicken. The jalapeno chicken was the same, 3 impossible to eat with chopsticks pieces of chicken in a huge amount of onions an jalapeno that did not taste like jalapeno but rather like bell peppers. The egg drop soup was kind of okay but looked like hot water with egg. Food should look tasty, too. Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Not good and expensive!! Don't get fooled by the fancy name save your money and get some pizza from next door"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst asian restaurant I've  ever been to. The food is frozen and it's not even good. I almost vomit in my mouth while trying this food. Not to mention when I tried to order the employee completely avoided me to talk to her co-worker."}
{"text":"Service was ok I guess but doesn't make up for the rice which was not good at all. I had a better chance at buying frozen Asian rice from frys! I was not satisfied"}
{"text":"Pass by a few times, their food don't look good but I finally gave it a try, because I was craving for Chinese food.  Very limited choices, small portions, taste OK but super oily!! They are too generous on using oil!

I don't like Panda Express that much, but if you compare this to Panda Express, Panda wins for sure!  Not going back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't give any stars, if I could. By far the worst Chinese food I've ever tried. Portions are ridiculously small for the prices. The employees made sure to shake any \"excess\" off before placing on the plate. I only got noodles for the side, because the rice didn't look very good. The peppered veggies and steak and the sesame chicken were dry and hard. Not a happy customer and I can't say I've ever said that about Chinese food. You know it's bad when the fork breaks off in the chicken smh.. I should have known, considering they were the only place with nobody in line."}
{"text":"The food taste pretty basic. They hardly give you any food and all the employees are depressed and rude. Just pick a different spot. Overpriced too."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Panda Express is better. I went In Needing food because I was so hungry and regret my choice. The sesame chicken had too much sauce and were literally hard as rocks. I couldn't even taste the chicken because it was overpowered by the outer shell and the sauce. The spicy chicken was okay but it wasn't crazy spicy. I could taste the chicken but it felt like a bland entree. The only thing I enjoyed was the fried rice.  Service is okay (the people are friendly!) but the food is incredibly passable."}
{"text":"Should have checked Yelp before getting this food.
This is a new low in Mall food court offerings.

Bad taste, tiny portions, $1.99 for one egg roll, no Chinese mustard.

The steamed rice was dry and tasteless.
One of my entrees was covered in oil.

Lo mein made with some sort of flour noodles instead of Buckwheat noodles.

My daughter couldn't even eat her food it was so bad!

Buy pork and vegetables had a meat with gristle in it."}
{"text":"this is basically a cheap version of panda express food taste like it was old and hard, on top of it all they charged me 3 times on my card and had to wait 4 days for a refund! sorry but its just not fair my kids were really hungry and food was to hard for them even chew..."}
{"text":"I just finished my meal and I really don't think I'll be coming back.   Food was old and just sitting out there.   But I was hungry.   The lo mein had no veggies and the fried rice was dried out and old.   I think they could do better."}
{"text":"Food is alright for mall food. People are not that friendly, and how do you run out of rice on a weekday at around 2pm. I asked the girl why, she said \"It gets busy, we run out of rice.\" Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Got the sesame and orange chicken. Food is not bad, although the serving sizes are pretty small."}
{"text":"Don't bother, wish I'd read the reviews first. I ordered orange and pepper chicken. He said it wasn't spicy because it's black people, well guess what? My mouth and throat are on fire. Not very good cuts of chicken, chewy and fatty. Horrible, plus my food is Luke warm."}
{"text":"Yelp really needs to add a 0 star. Their food is garbage. I guess it's a good thing their servings are small which is why I did not feel guilty throwing the rest of it away."}
{"text":"Awful food. Waste of money. It's frozen and they fry it up. I had to return my kids meal because the chicken was fried to oblivion. Don't waste your time, money and appetite."}
{"text":"Serving sizes are small.  Got the lo mein with sesame chicken and orange chicken.  The food didn't taste very good. Also, there weren't too many options of entrees."}
{"text":"Well what do you know, Arizona Mills Mall took out all the chain food places one would find in any given mall and replaced them with no named places.  

I was starving and at the mall so I decided to give Far East Asian Fire a try.  Now I really really hate that this would be there 1st review, but maybe things will get better after it.

When you walk up, you see items displayed, they do not look that enticing but you find out quickly they are just for display, not for eating, you can order what you want by looking at, and it will be cooked fresh for you. Great concept right?  Well maybe, maybe not.  

I went with a 3 item combo, ordered pepper beef & chicken with green beans with a veggie low mein. Since they cook your food after you order, do not expect this to be fast food like Panda Express, I was lucky and got to wait even longer because they messed up my order and had to redo it! They did apologize for the wait, but at that point I was already over this place.  Granted they have been there maybe for 2 months, but they don't seem to have their act together, and gawd forbid if it's a lunch hour rush with only one person cooking, expect to wait!

Lets start with the pepper beef, the bell pepers where fresh, in fact somewhere still raw, the beef not every tender at all, was more like the ends of a tuff beef skirt cut.  The chicken with green beans not bad, but not good either. The veggie low mein the noodles were completely over cooked and it tasted like mush.  And my mushy meal cost me close to ten bucks and I didn't have a drink.  Not the best bang for my buck.

I wasn't impressed with the lunch I ordered and my return factor is very low, unless they catch me on a starving, must eat now day!!! But even then I will have to remember I will have to wait 15 minutes for my fast food haha."}
{"text":"Wife ate here and said it was horrible.  She ordered orange chicken with white rice.  Rice tasted bland and old  the orange chicken was made fresh and wasn't good.  Will not be back"}
{"text":"Was at the Arizona Mills mall having a day of shopping when I got hungry for a quick bite to eat, so I decided to check the food court out and decided to give this place a try as I was craving some Asian food. 

I should have known not to come to this place when there wasn't anyone in line here, but a new item on the menu caught my eye and I wanted to try it. The new \"Spicy Dragon Fire Chicken\" looked just like what I was wanting at that moment. 

When I got up to the counter and asked how much it would cost to just get the one entree and rice the girl looked at me like she didn't understand. On their menu, they only show the prices of 2 and 3 item combos, so I just wanted to get a price. She looked at the one cook and he said \"I don't know..maybe $3.75?!\". She looked at me again and I said \"that's fine\". How do you not know the price of one item if you work there??

Next they didn't have any plan cooked white rice so I had to wait on that. Once she served me up the rice she put on a small amount of chicken which was mostly onions and a few pieces of dry chicken..nothing like it looked in the pictures. Where was the noodles and where were the jalape√±os? The chicken and onions were a bright red, so immediately I knew it was going to be spicy and boy was it spicy!! The rice didn't even help to cover up any of the spice. I swear it tasted like they pour a while bottle of cayenne on a small pot of chicken! I couldn't even eat it after just two bites. My mouth was on fire!! 

I paid almost $6 for something that wasn't worth eating. Won't be back! Very disappointing indeed."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! EATER BEWARE! My wife ordered a meal that included steam rice. To our surprise the steam rice included some extra fixins in the way of maggots. If you don't mind the extra protein, then this could be a place for you. We will not be eating rice for a very long time, we are disgusted. Check out my profile picture of the maggots."}
{"text":"Orange ginger chicken was decent enough, kinda dry though. The \"fried rice\" was AWFUL!"}
{"text":"This has to be the most bland Asian food I have ever had in my life. What a waste of money and chicken, because the meat was pretty juicy it was just gross and far under seasoned. They do not have fried rice, only noodles or white rice. I got the sesame chicken which is normally my favorite, but this was the absolute worst sesame chicken I have ever tasted. The mushroom chicken was okay. 

The portions ar small as well. I won't be back. Normally I would say at least give them a shot, but I do not suggest this place to anyone. The AZ Mills food court is pathetic as it is, but try another place and save yourself the disappointment."}
{"text":"Rip off... avoid. The food is flavorless and it's super expensive. Orange chicken looks like breaded chicken and doesn't taste like orange. Advertising bbq but they don't have any."}
{"text":"This is the worst chinese food I've every had and I normally like any chinese food place. The portions and prices are ridiculously out of wack for such bad quality of food and service. There was a lack of variety and what I had was terrible fried rice is so bad the chicken had way to much breading. I threw my food away and I'm fat. Then they had the nerve to charge for a refill on top of all that. I would never go back."}
{"text":"Wanted to grab a quick bite before a movie.  Panda express I never have an issue with so I don't see the difficulty here.  Orange chicken was blande.  Noodles were so overcooked and mushy I didn't touch them, and my egg roll was blonde and undercooked to the point you could taste grit in the roll.  Not happy. Won't be back.  Should have known better in the food court."}
{"text":"This place was so terrible even for a mall Chinese food place. The food was mediocre but it still tasted fine. The real issue is paying like 8 something when the lady shorted me on my food. She gave me like 2 half scoops of rice and two half scoops of the Orange and sesame chicken. The other guy next to her was serving full scoops of food! I don't know who the he'll trained this lady cuz that was just awful! I kept watching her and she kept doing the same to other customers as well. I've paid far less for far more food at other Chinese places I really don't get what the he'll this lady was doing. She's probably one of the cooks try to short customers on food cuz she's too lazy to make more batches of food. Overall I would not come here again. Save you're money and just eat anywhere but this mall. The food court is all owned by the same company so you'll probably get the same crap  service."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Chinese food I have ever had.  Ordered the 2 item combo, Sesame Chicken and Beef with Onions and Peppers. Both were so overcooked it was inedible. The meats were cooked until they were both crispy as in burnt.  What was truly amazing was that the onions weren't cooked at all so it was like eating burnt meat with a raw onion. Never again but even at a shopping mall food court one must expect better."}
{"text":"Not very Asian if you ask me.  The food was greasy and salty even for mall food. Most of it was soggy and the vegetables didn't even have a crunch or crisp to them. The 2 entr√©e plate was not worth the $7.00 paid.  Even my kids did not want to eat it and they love Panda Express.  This place, however does not even come close in comparison. I'm sad that after the remodel, they did not return.  I will not eat here ever again.  If I wanted grease I should have gone to Church's Chicken a few spots over."}
{"text":"Iam so disgusted! They have no chicken that is not deep fried and sweet! They have no vegetables! There choices were few! There is so little at az mills food court that is kid friendly and good for you and not sweet. The choices are ridiculous! We used to eat at the Asian type food places quite often at az mills. Now never since Villa took over!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon and I recommend not going to this place.  This was by far the worst chinese food I ever ate!  I mean c'mon people did you taste the food you make?  I thought this place would be a little better than panda express since its not a huge franchize but NO not good at all.  I got a two 3 entrees with a totally of 6 different items and some egg drop soup which of awful along with fried rice and wanna be lo mein noodles and the 6 items!  not tasty whatsoever.  waste of money and food if you wanna call it that, which went right into the trash."}
{"text":"Okay. So I am a little confused by all of these one star reviews.... I actually didn't look this place up on yelp before I went, i just happened to be in the food court of AZ Mills mall and wanted Chinese. So I got Chinese. After ordering I decided to check in and saw all the reviews and was a bit nervous about eating the food I just ordered. Turns out I really didn't have anything to worry about. Maybe it was a good day, or something but I got half fried rice, half lo mein, sesame chicken and orange ginger chicken. The rice was surprisingly good; most of the time it is dry but this wasn't. Same with the lo mein....I'm really picky about lo mein so for a place to actually have some that I consider good is saying a lot. The sesame chicken was very flavorful and had great seasoning on it... usually it is just meh with some random sauce that doesn't really have a flavor. The orange ginger chicken is why this is only 4 stars. It was okay but really not that great. Also when I had asked if it was spicy because some places do have spicy orange chicken I got a \"um it's orange chicken....\" Yes, I am aware of it... I can read. That doesn't answer weather it is spicy or not. Overall if I ever end up in the food court again I'd probably come back."}
{"text":"Every time I've been to this food court -- no matter the restaurant -- I'm always disappointed by the crunch factor of my rice. This is culinary 101. Learn how to cook and hot-hold rice! 

Anyhoo, aside from my crunchy surprise, the food was tasty. I had the General Tso's chicken and the ginger orange chicken. Both were nummy -- they also have packets of Sriracha so don't forget those! My only complaint with the food is that it isn't hot. Lukewarm at best. 

Oh and beware of the mixed veggies! They're good, but they add mushrooms to them! I hate mushrooms! Thankfully they're big so the nice lady was kind enough to pick them out for me when she was boxing up my order."}
{"text":"Greasy, bland, and overpriced. This is NOT Panda Express, as much as it try's to be. Avoid if possible"}
{"text":"One star only because it is eatable food and I don't think that I was poisened.

Over all the crappiest Asian style food I have ever had. 

Save yourself the disappointment and do not eat here."}
