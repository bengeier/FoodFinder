{"text":"Excellent chicken schnitzel sandwich and chevap. Friendly staff.  Cheap prices for high quality and fresh tasting food."}
{"text":"I haven't dined in yet, but have done takeout about 6 times now. Euro Bite is really close to home so I can order takeout, do some errands and come home with a hot dinner. You can't beat the price and I've always had good service. Schnitzel meals are great and travel well, and the baklava is awesome. I'm going to continue to support this business!"}
{"text":"I've been to Euro Bite numerous times. The service is always great and it doesn't hurt that they offer free wi-fi! All the schnitzel meals are delicious and come with real mashed potatoes! I would also recommend the burek (pies) that are especially good with some sour cream on the side (if you ask for it)! Other things to try: Cabbage Rolls (enough to feed two mouths ) and smoked pork sausage with stuffed potato!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches, a really big portion at a reasonable place, the owner is really nice and friendly and he explained all the ingredients that he was putting in our sandwiches, the desserts and cookies are really good too. I definitely see myself eating there every week."}
{"text":"Great quick service. Amazing Goulash ! Must try !! Great Schnitzel on a bun. Spinach & cheese pie definitely a must try. Baklava to die for !!"}
{"text":"Outstanding taste, unbeatable prices! I guess their chef is spicing food with some serious love! I never write reviews but I just had to, cause everyone needs to know that there is a place where they put love in food & aftertaste  in your mouth is gonna make you wanna come back again and again &  again, like everyone does..! Definitely a must  for all the foodies & pretty much everyone else who would  like to try some great food made with some serious good old fashioned love!"}
{"text":"Just came by for take out. Got the stuffed potato with sausage + sub the salad for mashed potato.    the sausage is good!!!!   but everything else seems to be slightly on the soggy side.   other than that the service is good"}
{"text":"I love this little restaurant. I usually order cabbage rolls or schnitzel sandwich. Both delicious. The quality of food is great and fresh. The owner who is there often is super nice and friendly and always has a smile"}
