{"text":"How has nobody else given Rose props for her amazing sandwiches?  My first time there she rather hilariously proclaimed her sandwiches would boost my libido and make me a virile sex machine.  The Banh Mi are delectable, massive, and cost $2 tax included.  TWO DOLLARS!  Where on earth do you find a deal like that in this day and age? $10 flat gets you 5 sandwiches, which will feed you for 3 days.

There are a gazillion reviews for Banh Mi Boys, with their inflated pricing and rather pretentious take on the venerable sandwich.  Their food is great, don't get me wrong - but there's no tradition, and you're feeding a hipster machine with good branding, location, and social media presence. It will also set you back $20 for one meal.  I urge you to save your money for Rose.

Rose does it right."}
{"text":"I can't say it any better than Bart D did*. I agree with every word. Except I paid $2.50 for my fabulous shredded chicken sandwich today. SUCH A BARGAIN and so delicious. Incredible.

*Rose made no claims about virility when preparing my sandwich. Which is just as well. As I'm not a guy and stuff."}
{"text":"Love this place. The ladies behind the counter are always cheerful and happy to see me. I must say, the tofu sandwich is the best. Super cheap too. Recommend."}
{"text":"Rose's Rocks!!!! . . . walking around the gerrard/broadview areas, store front caught my attention so I popped-in to take a peak. Tiny lil sandwich/grocery shop. 2 cute vietnamese mamasan's behind the counter were super-sweet. One of them ( . . .maybe rose?), had lil bit of a fun, friendly, flirty energy. Totally dug her vibe. Food wise . . . forgetaboutit!!!!!! Best bahn mi in the city! Initially  I ordered only the chicken sandweech. Standing next to an asian dude ( . . . happened to be japanese), I noticed he was ordering the meatball. Asked if they're were tasty, he's like, dude, they're awesome. Boom, solid endorsement, so I ordered a meatball on the fly. Just before payiing and heading out, I noticed the spring-rolls. They were massive. Always a sucker for crispy, crunchy, tender rolls, I asked for 4 to take home. Rose insisted I also grab and snack on one on the spot. She's such a cutie I couldn't resist. Pork-filled spring-roll heaven. Taste, texture 10++++++. Seriously, tasted soooooooo good it was retarded. Easily one of the best in the city! 

I wasn't even 10 feet from the store, walking across the street before I tore open the wrapper to take a taste of the meatball. Killer asian sub in everyway. Toasty french style bun, crazy fresh ingredients ie cilantro etc. Hot sauce was also a killer. Made in-house . . . picked-up hints of hot chillie peppers, garlic, maybe soy (not 100% sure).

2 awesome authentic vietnamese sandwiches + 5 killer spring-rolls . . . 10 buck$

Great food, great price, great people."}
{"text":"Rose's can't be beat for banh mi!  Flavourful, cheap, clean, fresh. Rose's is the best in the GTA! Thank you, Rose's!"}
{"text":"5 out of 5 for their Vietnamese sandwich buns. $2.50 per bun including tax. Enough said. 

Their salad rolls are pricey at $4-5 for a pack of 4 but they are very yummy with the sauces provided. Totally recommend.

Spring rolls however are nothing to write home about. They were bland with too much cabbage and didn't come with any dipping sauce. I think they are around $1-1.20."}
{"text":"Fast and efficient service, tasty food and very cheap. 
 
I always order a couple of Bahn Mi and spring rolls when I go, and it never disappoint.  

The buns are generously filled unlike a few other places in the neighborhood. 

There are always a large selection of deserts and snacks on the counter that tempts me everytime I am there.   With each items a few bucks each, I always grab a few to try."}
{"text":"Whenever I crave banh mi (vietnamese sandwiches), this is my goto place.  It's tasty, no nonsense (no frills), and super cheap.  Also, if you happen to get there when they just finish making egg rolls, you have to buy a few (they're only like 50 cents!  When they're warm and crispy - yummm!"}
{"text":"3 Dollars for a deluxe assorted banh mi, how could you go wrong? The sandwiches are made in the spot which  are great because Ive had pre-made ones and they can get stale. 

Once you take a bite of the sandwich you won't stop. I would make this my go to if it was a bit closer but if need by ill make the drive."}
{"text":"You will find the best Vietnamese subs here! 3 dollars for a DELUXE sub! Delicious and wholesome it can't get any better. Once you try, you will never go back to eating those pre-made ones from supermarkets. They make it in front of you when you order so it's always FRESH. I really like how the subs are placed inside a plastic bag so everything is contained and you can't make a mess. 

\"You want spicy?\" Consider carefully when asked.  Be warned that their spicy subs are REALLY spicy. Your eyes will widen. Your nostrils will expand. 

Before you end your visit, try their Vietnamese coffee. $3 for a large size. Its rich and creamy Java will make you rethink life and not drink poor watered down Vietnamese coffee again!

I recently tried their pho broth cubes ($1 for 4 cubes inside a package) It's not the best nor bad either for making quick instant broth for your pho noodles!"}
{"text":"Giving full stars since it's my first time and the experience was highly satisfactory. Huge selection in the menu but I was so excited when I got inside I just pointed randomly to the prepared sandwiches when the madam working up some subs asked me what I wanted. 

Word of advice:

Just say Yes when asked if \"You want it spicy?\" because the kick from the chili buried somewhere in that bahn mi will come as a wonderful bonus. 

Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"great for a quick bite and cheap! glad I stumbled upon this place and close by as well"}
{"text":"Really? Why has this place gotten perfect 5 stars every time? I stumbled upon this place on Yelp and went here under the recommendation of other Yelpers; before my review this place had a perfect 5/5 stars. 

It was not even close to being a perfect 5/5 Banh Mi. Given I've had better ones outside of the city, I still am disappointed in the misleading reviews. It was good, it was adequate, it was one of those meals where you'd grab if you were in the area or if you were a broke college student who needs substance in their body. But it was not the best Banh Mi I've ever had."}
{"text":"Love love love rose! Joey S is right, it's not the best but still really good! Try this spot, they have a variety of meats so everyone will be good. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The bahn mi here is great. The lady who works here may have not fully understood my English, but hey, that adds to the adventure right? I tried the meat ball and bbq pork bahn mis. They were both so tasty. They do not skim on the ingredients like some other places. Also, I really like wrap the bahn mis in individual plastic bags, which helps preserve the flavor, much cleaner/ superior to other places' bahn mi in a lunch bag. Finally, as a word of warning: when they ask if you want it spicy, it is super spicy. Make sure you pick up a carton of milk from the supermarket next door!"}
{"text":"Since my other viet sub store closed I have found roses to be the perfect substitute for them. spring rolls are absolutely delicious and the lady at the counter refuses to let you just buy one. Prices are cheap around $3 for sub $1 for spring rolls"}
{"text":"Great food for cheap! A feast for 2 for $12. The assorted bahn mi, spring rolls and bao burger were all delicious."}
{"text":"I was around the area yesterday and noticed a few kids going in to Rose's, so I decided to drop by and try their banh mi. 

The lady (who I'm assuming is Rose) was very friendly. I got the regular cold cut which consisted of roughly 4 pieces of pork slices. Overall I enjoyed the bun as it was softer and easier to bite into than some of the other ones. It had a bit of chewiness to it that I also appreciate, and didn't hurt my mouth biting into the bread like some of the breads that are harder (crunchier) on the outside...you'll find this one is much softer and chewier.

I enjoyed the deli cold cuts, but found that there wasn't as much filling in it than the ones I had at Nguyen Huong in Spadina. The pate was delicious but they don't put as much mayo into this one which I absolutely LOVE. In terms of the slices, it was a decent amount, but I think you get more at Nguyen (although Rose's slices are thicker). Overall I'd give it a 4 star and would definitely go back. It's a great place to satiate your banh mi craving for only $2.50 each!"}
{"text":"friendly place, greets you when u enter. the viet food selection is good, i usually get their viet subs which is yummy and filling. they have a variety of snacks like goi cuon (rice rolls) steam pork buns, and many kinds of sticky rice options and they sweet desserts! great place , i visit them often when i need something light and affordable."}
{"text":"Compared to the one in Chinatown (Nguyen Huong Food). I would have to say both places are just about the same. Except the ones from Nguyen Huong Food have more fresh ingredients and give you slightly less toppings. Same price as Nguyen Huong Food, $2.50 for cold cut bahn mi. If you are in the area, grab one on the go!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate a banh mi I broke up with my girlfriend.   Now everytime I eat banh mi it makes me happy.   Rose makes the happiest sandwiches in Toronto and for a good price.   Ask for no bag for your sandwich and you save the environment but no discount.  I don't complain add the process are already good. 

If ever you are getting lobster ay Bill's I totally recommend stopping by rose's for a Vietnamese sub."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Beaches. I have fond memories of going to the closest Chinatown with my mom, which was around the Broadview and Gerrard area. My mom would get a number of bakery items, which we savoured. Sadly, this particular bakery has since folded.

Although I live in Markham, which has a ton of Chinese bakeries, I still prefer to drive down to this Chinatown to get decent, yummy baked goods. I tend to visit three different bakeries when I make a bakery run. Rose's Vietnamese Sandwiches is one of my three stops.

Coincidentally, when it's a long weekend, I tend to do my bakery run. A while back, I had a decent conversation with one of the charming ladies at this place. She felt bad that she had run out of a food item that I had wanted. Instead, she made a deal with me to take three pork-filled buns that contain egg and sausage, and pay $5. Considering that I love them so much and this place makes the tastiest version that I have ever had, I went for it.

No matter what you order, this place does not skip on ingredients. Everything is delicious.

I have also had their fresh rolls, which consist of either shrimp or sausage, rolled up with carrots and vermicelli, held together by a thin rice wrapper. The dipping sauce makes these rolls yummy.

Of course, get a banh mi or more here. I love that you can customize your sandwich the way that you want. The bread is crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, which is perfect.

It's cash-only here, so hit an ATM before you visit.

{"text":"The best and freshest basic bahn mi in Toronto + some daily items that are often worth to try. Owner is nice and there is no hush-hush here, as opposed to other downtown basic bahn mi places."}
{"text":"Dropped by Rose's Vietnamese Sandwiches on a Saturday afternoon. Service was friendly and efficient; I ordered a regular cold cut banh mi for $3. I liked how there were plenty of pickled radishes in the sandwich but I felt that the meat was lost with the flavour of the vegetables. Can't complain about the fillings as there was a lot of everything but I still prefer to get my banh mis elsewhere in the city."}
