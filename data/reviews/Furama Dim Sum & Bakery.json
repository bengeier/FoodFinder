{"text":"Surprisingly (or maybe not so much), everything but the dim sum is good. The har gow was so terrible I couldn't even get mad at it...I mean what did I expect? Lol. But the hot and sour soup was excellent, as were some of the other hot table items. They also have several combos which seem to be pretty good deals. Service was friendly. An appropriate food court choice in desperate times :)"}
{"text":"2.5 stars, I'm not a fan of Chinese fast food. But my bf seems to love it. We shared a combo last time, pretty cheap if I remember. Nothing special or amazing. I've never tried their bakery items though, so not sure if they're good. I also saw vitasoy drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent for a quick lunch break from work or break from the same old Instant Pot cooked bulk meals you've made to cover all week.  You can't make this stuff in an Instant Pot.  I usually get the large chicken combo which comes with your choice of (General Tao, Sweet and Sour, Honey Garlic, and other variety of chicken) with a side of rice or various noodles (or a mix of both) and broiled veggies which comes out to around under $8 total.  The large comes in one of those standard rectangular takeout styrofoam containers.  The man wearing the glasses behind the counter is extremely nice and eager to please, and occasionally when they try out new dish on their menu, he'll offer you a sample (much props to that dude!).  The quality of the food is slightly better than Manchu Wok, but for less.  I highly recommend this place for a quick hassle-free lunch or dinner filler when compared to the other food joints in the Sheppard Centre, especially on value."}
{"text":"I have trouble finding good dim sum let alone any dim sum in the Bathurst/Sheppard area.  So I was delighted when I stepped out of the Sheppard/Yonge subway station to find this little diamond in the rough. They have all the basic dumplings ready to go at a decent price. It isn't mind-blowing dim sum, but definitely great when on the go to order. They've got vegetarian options and a great flavor to the dumplings as well.   Worth a look at if you are in the area. Check them out."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I have been here. They have take out Chinese food, i.e. beef, chicken pork dishes, noodles, etc.  They also have an array of yum-cha.  Not primo, a bit on the greasy side, but acceptable:  Char siu bau   -   small buns, small amount of filling, but not fatty (a plus) and tasty; Jean dwae - not the way I remember these before - they were greasier than I remember ... Lap-xhong sausage - EXCELLENT, pleasantly surprised, worth every ounce of calories; Pork + cabbage pot stickers - a bit doughy/oil factor.  Having said this, the har-gau looked exceptional as did the siu-mai.  A lady was ordering won-ton soup which looked very good.  This place is acceptable, especially if you're in a rush and need some go-to sustenance.  One thing has not changed here:  pleasant, courteous, friendly and polite customer service."}
{"text":"This place gets super busy on the weekdays at lunch time. I got dim sum combo b which was perfect as a light snack before my haircut appointment. The food was good, though I think it was a little pricey. $5.07 for 5 pieces of dim sum with a drink."}
{"text":"They have great deals as far as prices and portion sizes are concerned, but they served the outright worst Chinese food I've ever had (and I eat it several times a week). The sauce on my General Tao chicken was an overtly sour mix of what seemed like a mild chili sauce and vinegar (lots of it), with absolutely none of the sweetness or spice usually associated with the dish (perhaps the chef forgot to add sugar?). The egg noodles and veggies with the meal were also entirely bland and without much flavour. It's not good when an entirely pedestrian spring roll is the best part of your meal."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Super nice owners. Fast and efficient. Im a regular and I have had just about everything there. Delicious spicy shrimp, spicy squid, peppered fish and ginger garlic chicken! The portions for the meals are big! I can walk away from there feeling stuffed and satiated! The dimsum is yum too! My favorites are the bbq bun, deep fried shrimp wonton, siumai and hargow. Their shrimp wonton soup is really good too. The wontons have a whole shrimp in there. They are these fat little balls of juicy delight. The broth that the wonton soup comes in is good too. Two thumbs up!"}
