{"text":"I can hardly wait to go back!!!!!
I ordered take out.....Ackee and salt fish, royal Caribbean fish, and escovitch fish.  All the dishes came with provisions and steamed vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, and carrots). The provisions were boiled well and there was no grease in any of the meals. The flavour was fabulous and there was hardly any salt, if any at all. The RCF had hot pepper and onions over top of a massive red snapper. The EF had hot peppers, okra and onions over top. After we were done the meal, I called the restaurant to offer my compliments to the chef as the food was AMAZING!!! As for the restaurant environment, the tables and chairs are white, there is a beautiful mirror with lovely carved wooden frame. Peach and blue highlights add to the feeling of an authentic Caribbean restaurant. If you like flavorful foods and large portions you should go to this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME FOOD, AWESOME SERVICE!! The chef will even come out and talk to u and ask u how the food was. The curry goat, oxtail, stew chicken or the roti, either way?? ure good!!! U can even get an oxtail & chicken combo for the price of a large oxtail dish!!! Sooooooooo Good (russell peters asian people voice)  tell em i sent u ;)"}
{"text":"ROTI FOREVER. 

I tried one of their vegetarian options. Mine had veggies and curry sauce and it was amazing!! Good portion size for two, although next time I am ordering 1 for myself...hehe. This was my first time trying roti so I have nothing to compare it to but I really loved the flavour/spice level. It's on the spicer side. 100% going to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Love it!

So happy to find this place. The decor is beautiful, the food was yummy (we both ordered the oxtail - it could have been spicier, but great hot sauce was available), the rum punch knocked my socks off, and the service was AWESOME! So nice to have a smiling, helpful server. I'll definitely be back - and often!"}
{"text":"I grew up in a Caribbean neighbourhood and I can attest that this place is legit across the board.

It's a quiet little spot in the St Clair West area near Dufferin. The service was excellent as I ordered the Caribbean combo but they were out of jerk chicken. Low and behold when it was ready (they take their time to cook it the right way) she was able to conjure some jerk chicken to compliment my curry goat. 

My date had the veggie roti and she absolutely loved it. She remarked that they had a lot of excellent vegetarian options which is key when you're dating a vegetarian lol. We had fried plantains and they weren't greasy, just perfect to snack on and occasionally dip in my curry.

I probably will say that this is best curry goat I've had in Toronto and will definitely be back especially now that winter is back and you gotta keep warm in this city with some real proper soul food."}
{"text":"Heard awesome things about the jerk chicken and ox tail so we decided to try it out.  The decor brings me back to the south America's.  White wood chairs and comfy cushions along the benches against the walls.  Service was extremely pleasant and timely.  

We were a party of 5 and decided got to order split a variety of dishes which includes their jerk chicken, ox tail, fried chicken, chicken roti, chicken and shrimp platter.  On the side we ordered rice and bean and pasta.  My favorite dish has to be their oxtail and I have no problem recommending it for oxtail lovers.  I would have to say their jerk chicken was my second favorite dish.  The spice was good on chicken and roti but I find the fried chicken to be a little dry and the roti was lacking some sauce.

Anyhow, the oxtail and service that royal Caribbean offers is worth a try for anyone that loves jerk chicken."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!! My girlfriend ordered a jerk chicken salad and it took 30 minutes to get to the table and when it did, the chicken was raw in the middle?  She asked for it to be taken back and said she would just like some salad...so they took the chicken off and gave her the same salad????? Are they trying to kill people???When she told the woman that it was the same salad she smirked and just said okay???Not cool at all...Eat there at your own risk?"}
{"text":"Food was delicious would have given the restaurant five stars buttttt the wait for the food was very longggg. And I had to wait another 20 mins after every one at my table received their food because my plate was forgotten or possibly given to another table. Waitress could have given me a free dessert or something to rectify the situation..."}
{"text":"The chicken roti and goat roti was overly salty and not very flavorful. They both had many small pieces of sharp bone scattered within in rotis. Small portions. They mix the coleslaw with spring mix giving it a bitter and sweet taste which is not appealling in the slightest. I am completely disappointed. My daughter and I forced ourselves to eat half of the portion because we were hungry."}
{"text":"Really good jerk chicken the comes in generous servings. We're so lucky to have this place within walking distance"}
{"text":"Had take out,  Good service, Good curry goat and stew ox tail. Roti skins (dhalpuri) can be ordered separately for about CAD4 plus tax.  Might be spicy for the North American palette but will be warm and tasty for the caribbean and more worldly tongues."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for more than a decade. It's always been great. The shrimp roti is the BEST!! The jerk chicken is amazing and the goat is as well. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere has improved significantly a few years ago..."}
{"text":"Everything was tasty from start to finish. Codfish fritter appetizers were a bit oily, but very crispy. Oxtail fell off the bone; curried, fried and jerk chicken, as well as the accompanying salad, were all hits. I felt satisfied at the end of the meal, not weighed down as is sometimes typical with West Indian fare. Will definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"So sad cause this place is really cute! I got a chicken roti and the roti shell was the only yummy part of it... The filling was too saucy with too few pieces of chicken or potato, and the chicken itself was mostly larger chopped pieces of bone and soo many bone splinters, I spent most of my time eating just trying to dig pieces of bone out of my mouth. I eventually gave up cause there were more sharp little bone shards than actual chicken. It actually felt dangerous to eat. Too bad."}
{"text":"Straight goods this place is the real deal. Been here over 5 times and absolutely love this place. The food is always fresh including the rice and peas which most restaurants I find tend to re-heat day(s) rice. 

My parents swear by their steamed fish but I however LOVE their jerk chicken. Definitely braised the meat just falls off the bone. 

Their cod fish fritters are one of my favs however they may not always be available.

My only knock on this place is the small seating / long waiting times(about 45min-1hr)"}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto, my boyfriend and I tried a lot of different restaurants. This one was the best by far. Honestly, one of the best meals we've ever had! At an extremely reasonable price, no less.

We ordered the Jamaican Codfish fritters to start. WOW! Was extremely interesting, and VERY tasty. Highly recommend, even if you don't like fish (which I don't, really. I was trying to be adventurous and it paid off!)

I had the Ox Tail for my dinner, and my boyfriend ordered the jerk chicken. So much flavor, and really worth trying. I've never had anything like it. Service was great, and the atmosphere is cozy and beautifully simple. I can't rave about this place enough!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!

This place is amazing and serves real authentic Jamaican food.
I ordered the Royal Caribbean Fish $15 (have a side choice of rice, veggies, festival, provision) It was a red snapper fish and I got it with provision.

WOW, the portion was huge! Fish was beautifully seasoned with a nice gravy that had onions, tomato and okra in it. The minute I tasted it, it took me back to this one eatery in Montego Bay that I love.
There was also mixed veggies of cabbage, carrots, and broccoli
Everything was outstanding.

Service was very warm, the place is literally SPOTLESS. My cutlery was shining no joke. Bathrooms were great as well.
During my stay there was a steady flow of pple ordering takeout and dining in.

Coming back 100%"}
{"text":"Best Jamaican food in the city. 
Excellent escovitch fish, excellent jerk and roti, love the festivals, authentic flavours. I don't know what they put in the pickled vegetables but damn! Hot and addictive!
Good little vibe and this place is always busy!"}
{"text":"When you want great Caribbean food with good ambiance, this is definitely the place for you. With their shell and salmon-coloured decor, the food was as pleasing as the physical space. I recommend the stewed oxtails; very tasty. The house red wine, generously poured, was fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, ambience relaxing and suitable for taking a table and eating with friends , family or a date 
Nice drinks and cocktails 
Good food that does not disappoint and is reasonably priced. The folks working there are friendly and offer good service"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic jamaica experience I highly recommend this place. I had the stew chicken which an amazing gravy, my boyfriend had the fried chicken. Both meals were delicious! My mother on a separate occasion had the red snapper
She loved her meal. This is where Jamaicans go for a real Jamaican meal"}
{"text":"Had my teams Christmas lunch here. The service and food was fantastic !!! Definitely coming back. Great job guys."}
