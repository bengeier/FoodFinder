{"text":"Had the worst service ever there. I used to go on a regular basis, but the service has been going down hill and finally hit bottom. I really don't think the waitress spoke English. We waited for 20 minutes to get our check and had to ask again for someone to find our waitress for it to finally come. Then another 15 minutes to get our bill back. When we complained to the hostess, she said oh, ok.  There's plenty of Japanese Steak houses, we will now be going to another."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Chef was entertaining and very good.  Food ehhhhh a bit bland nothing really popped and was just mostly sort of bland.  And seems a bit pricy compared to other Japanese steak houses in the area."}
{"text":"Ok first off the food was not cooked with any care. My daughter who was allergic to shrimp literally cried because the chef wasnt even skilled enough to cook it carefully on grill in front. So they made it in back and it literally took the whole meal for her to get it. She is 5 years old and loves hibachi. She cried simple as that. Now the food only thing was good was the scallops only because of the product not the cooking. My steak was over cooked i wanted rare to med rare came out med well nearly well. The chef joked like I was being sarcastic but it was bull literally bull caca. He wasnt funny, no volcanoe until i asked. No egg trick No sesame seeds again until i asked. He went to other chefs cart to get ingredients. This place blows and you will blow your hard earned cash. I am a chef myself. I have also worked in a kabuto but it was not this poorly ran or any degree near this. Not all kabutos suck but this was horrible. Get better chefs. The other 3-5 star reviews I am baffled that Charlotte thinks that it is quality hibachi? Read my reviews I have eatten hibachi all over. I speak the truth hopefullu yelp posts this for recommended because its not a lie one bit."}
{"text":"This is the fourth and final place we stopped at yesterday. The sushi bar is small and there isnt much of a variety of rolls to choose from. The sushi chef was great and he asked for our likes and dislikes. He altered our rolls to our liking and they were very good. He handed us, in two seperate occasions, complimentary rolls that he felt we would like. They were both very good. We would like to give this place a solid 3 - 3.5 stars but as we checked out we found that we were charged for one of the complimenary rolls by the owner. Maybe it was a misunderstanding. Maybe we should have said something. We may go again because we really enjoyed the sushi chef and the rolls. The chef said he would \"hook us up\" next time but we're worried of the spying owner that may charge us again for a complimentary roll, but it wont happen twice without a fight from us. We'll see...."}
{"text":"We were happy with the experience... Stick with the traditional Saki though,  the favored versions are simply syrup added which takes away from the punch and heat. Drink a few Saki' 2 compliment the food - U. R. eating Japanese!!! Our chef was very entertaining & better than past experiences with other places in the category."}
{"text":"Kabuto has wonderful age tofu. I've been her numerous times with my boyfriend. We are still new to the area and last week when we ate at Kabuto's, we noticed that our car was running out of gas. The owner gave us directions and told us to call the restaurant if we ran out of gas before we got to the gas station and that he would help us. That is wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"The food was good but the chef did not speak the whole time while cooking. I am not sure if it was his first day :\"}
{"text":"Our cook lacked the organizational skills to get the meal on our plates so that we could enjoy it without an item getting cold. But, he was pleasant and courteous, and I made it enjoyable because he was trying. 
The owner should clean the carpets and be sure that all cooks are ready to entertain and get the food on your plate in a timely manner before they are called to service."}
{"text":"Food: ekk...putting alto of soy sauce and butter doesn't make the food taste better...just salty. 

Service: SUCKS big time...our waitress was so so slower were seated before another group and they done and left before we got our meal cooked. The orders were put in wrong. Keep having to ask for drinks refill; guess because of the over salty food. 

Price: There's a saying \"you get what you pay for\" It's cheaper than Benihana. I rather go to Benihana and pay more and get better service and experience.

Overall: Would most likely not come back...the Pineville location is alot better."}
{"text":"The first time here was very good, food was tasty and service was good. We did  go back two other times. Last time we went was the last time. The cook we had the very last time was awful,  not accomodating, dry and did not really care to serve us. With that incident, I personally will not go back and give that rude cook my money!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for 7 years. Their sushi is excellent. Service is fast. 

I order at the bar. They have a great selection of beer.

Ingredients are fresh and the sushi chef is incredibly skilled.

Sushi rolls are half off on Wednesday and Thursday."}
{"text":"They don't serve sushi on Saturday nights, I was so disappointed! We were seated fairly quickly but waited over an hour for our food. It was nothing special, pretty basic compared to what I've seen elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was actually in search of another place that serves hibachi, but I went here instead after seeing that it was closer and had good reviews as well. I must have been there on a bad day because the service was slow, the food was bland, and the price/portion was sad. 

I ordered the vegetable hibachi with salad, no soup because it's made from shrimp-based broth and I'm vegetarian. I waited almost 25 mins before my food was ready for take out. The hostess handed me a bill ,which was about $11 and some change and I inquired if she had charged me for the soup as well even though I did not buy any. (They couldn't even replace the soup for one that was vegetable-based). She said that  they still have to charge you for it. Alright, that's fine. I look inside the takeout box to make sure my order is correct, and inside is the most pathetic portion I've ever seen: full of rice and a tiny portion of chopped up vegetables. The salad wasn't a real salad either: chunks of browned iceberg lettuce with a few shreds of carrot. 

I was pretty upset about this so I told the hostess that the portion was a pretty bad size for $11 and they didn't even have enough vegetables in it. She gave me this \"ummmm\" look and stepped into the office with the cash register. I waited about a minute or two and she never came out; I left.

So the service was slow, portion was terrible for the price, and no one came out to address my issue.  Oh well, just my luck- but it gets worse: I get home and start eating my meal anyway, but it's so bland that I have to add my own soy sauce. The ginger dressing for the \"salad\" was fine and the best part was the chili sauce-  it was actually spicy and not oily. Good job Kabuto.

I might return to try their sushi, but I definitely won't be getting anything else here again, and I wouldn't recommend getting takeout from here as well."}
{"text":"Food is great quality and the people are super friendly. Can't beat half price sushi on Wednesdays/Thursday's"}
{"text":"Ordered a spicy salmon roll, sake sashimi, and a side of fried rice for lunch. 

The salmon roll was not spicy but it was good. The sashimi was ok. The fried rice was tasty. 

I love the decor and seating inside, also the staff is super friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, subpar food. Will not return, I'll stick with Nakatos which is less than a mile from this location."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for lunch yesterday.  It was pretty quiet.  The chef was young and seemed a little bit nervous to me.  The food was good.  The fried rice was excellent.  The fillets were good.  I think the fried rice and vegetables are better here than at the Pineville store.  I do believe that this store is a little more expensive than the Pineville store.  I am not sure why.  Overall an excellent steak and stir fry lunch!"}
{"text":"I was craving some hibachi grilled food and this place jumped out at me.   The service was fine and our server made sure our drinks were always full.   The soup and salad came out in a timely manner and the overall flavor and taste of the food was decent, nothing to crave over though.  I was slightly disappointed in the noodles, that's all they were, just some heated up noodles on the grill, no flavor, not taste, no nothing, just noodles.   
My reasoning for only two stars is that our cook was not very personable.   He did no tricks with his utensils, no volcano, no train, he didn't really interact with the group at all.  He cooked the food and that was about it.  When going to these hibachi grills, part of the reason for going is the entertainment and to have fun while the cook makes all your food.   I'll look to a different hibachi grill next time."}
{"text":"We decided to go here in search of something different to eat and wanted an experience to go along with it.  The place is kind of dingy and run down looking around the restaurant on the inside, but hey we weren't here to look at pictures on the wall but see what one of our amazing (hopefully fingers crossed) cook can do in front of us.  So we are seated and there is another table adjacent to ours who was seated probably 5-10 minutes before we were.  With that being said, we received service from another cook and not theirs.  If we had the cook the table next to us had, I would have given this place four stars.  He had a lot of energy and was very personable with everyone at his table, something our server lacked.  He was just going through the motions, not much personality to go with him.  The volcano was the most exciting part of his \"exhibition.\"  The food was decent enough.  I got the shrimp and it tasted good, just not enough shrimp as part of the dish.  This is not a place I would regularly go to, since it is a place reserved for more special occassions or dinner dates.  So, overall not the best or the worst experience, but my takeaway from it all is whoever your cook is can make or break your experience here."}
{"text":"I was out to eat with a friend and witnessed his horrible experience and since someone took down his review, I'll summarize.

Forget for a moment, the ignorant, at best, sign that states no hoodies, sagging pants, or marijuana smell. The manager at this restaurant is absolutely the worst and has no business in the hospitality industry. Might I suggest a non-customer facing role? He stated that there was no \"return policy,\" as if to say that no matter how your food comes out, you have to accept it. This is simply unacceptable. To make matters worse, the item he ordered off the Sushi menu was not half-price like it was stated. My friend was charged full price. When he called to complain he was called \"dumb and stupid\" multiple times and the manager stated that he did not care about losing his business. Wow!

I normally don't post reviews as you can see based on my profile, but this is simply not right. You cannot treat people the way this restaurant does and continue doing business.

DO NOT GIVE THESE UNGRATEFUL PEOPLE YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good place to get steak and sushi. Found this place on Yelp didn't bother reading the review just wanted to try it by the pictures people posted. Definitely a must try the owner was nice and so was the sushi chef. They both bs'd with me the whole time. I just moved to Charlotte from Arizona and been hunting good sushi places down. This is in my top 5 places to eat at now."}
{"text":"Very delicious and huge amount of food! I went with a group of 5 and one was a child.  We all loved the food being made in front of us.  Our waiter was great and joked around and didn't just do his part and leave. 

We had the chicken and steak hibachi and everyone's food was cooked deliciously.  The child only wanted noodles but the chef was so kind and even gave her some chicken and rice.  

 The rice, noodles, veggies, and meat were cooked to perfection and the other people that were sat with us were fun to be around also! The portions were amazing! So much food that I took about half of mine home!

I would recommend the hibachi to anyone who is hungry and loves to have their food cooked directly in front of them!"}
{"text":"It once was a great place to eat, but the quality of food is poor, its gotten really greasy and the portions of food is smaller than before. This was once my favorite place to go but no more. Ill be going to Nakato for now on."}
{"text":"I don't get the negative reviews...
We thought it was amazing both times we ate here, of course, we did get ours to go.
Will have to be seated next visit..."}
{"text":"Good food and service and karaoke night on Saturday is hilarious. The hibachi is great and if you want cheap decent sushi go for it! Very simple rolls and a menu where you check off what you want. Enjoyed it."}
{"text":"4 stars for 1/2 price sushi on Wednesdays and Thursdays! Nothing incredibly inventive here. Basic sushi and good hibachi, if you choose to sit at one of the cook-in-front-of-you tables. 

Not super accommodating of special sushi requests, but that could've just been the waitress. Overall the rolls were good for a great price. The sushi rice wasn't mushy (a huge pet peeve). And the service was efficient. 

Don't come here for ambience, but if you need a cheap sushi fix, this should do it."}
{"text":"I love the food and the prices.  Wed and Thursday  sushi half off.  Hospitality and  great customer service.  He owners are very nice and the waiters treat you with respect."}
{"text":"Kabutos is good for what it is:  a Benihana-type restaurant.  A group of about 8 people sit around a giant grill and are entertained by the chef as he cooks the meals right in front of them, wielding sharp knives and doing tricks with each food item he prepares.  Kids especially love it and it's also good fun for a group of friends going out on the town.

The Hibachi dinners generally come with a salad with ginger dressing (YUM!), rice and veggies, an option of a choice of meat, and dipping sauces.  The flavor of the meal is very good despite the relatively few ingredients put into each (and I normally love a lot of spices).   And I do enjoy the entertainment of watching my meal prepared in front of me.

As for the sushi, I have yet to try it since I usually reserve eating sushi for when I visit sushi houses.  When I go to a Japanese steakhouse, I typically want the Hibachi show and food. 

I haven't been to other Kabuto locations, but this particular Kabuto could use some refreshment.  It's a little dark and dingy inside with no particular decor or splashes of color.  Hence, part of my reasoning for only a 3-star rating.

Why else?  Kabutos isn't someplace I'd go out of my way for, but if someone's going I might tag along.  I've dined at Benihana's in L.A. and at Mitsukoshi at Epcot so, to me, Kabutos pales in comparison.  But hey--it's cheaper than a plane ticket!"}
{"text":"We did the birthday dinner thing there with a group of people last weekend and it was a shoddy time to say the least. It took them forever to seat us which I don't particularly hold against them because I understand they like to wait for the entire party to arrive so they can flip tables better but it' always seems to drag forever. Once we got seated they took our orders and started rolling out the soups and salads. The best part was when I ordered Tempura with shrimp and the waiter asked me if that was sushi. Good stuff, Our chef guy was pretty spot on with the usual flamboyant spatula flipping and knife slicing and I'd probably say his show was the best part of the evening. The food itself was everything you would expect from hibachi style grill and the portions were generous. 

After the meal they came out and sang the bday song and served up the cake just like usual so that part of the evening rolled fairly well. It just feels like the employees are going through the motions and sometimes its painful to watch them sing. Next time I'll request no less than three takes on the bday song each time telling them \"needs more cowbell\". 

Time to pay the bill and get out right?....Sure, if you want to wait forever and a day. Oh yeah, and when my bill came it had my Tempura listed but that was a little bit of a thumb in the eye since the tempura never arrived to begin with. I had the guy remove it from the check which added even more time to the already lengthy process of getting the hell out. 

The last \"best part\"of the evening is when the bartender from the bar area approached my buddy to pay his tab from when we were waiting for our table when we first arrived. My friend had already paid in cash though. Whoever the bartender guy was he totally missed the 20$ my friend laid on the bar for some beers and accosted him in front of everyone to pay up. The bartender eventually backed off which was a nice little concession but the insult was already there lingering in the air. 

I'd give this place another try if the discounted sushi is as good as some of the reviews say. But standing on service, cost and cleanliness I'd recommend that you just shop around for a different place."}
{"text":"So in my search to create a Japanese Steakhouse list, we stopped into Kabuto last night in the University Area. Sushi bar up front and the cook-tops in the back. It was a slow night, so I was curious to see the quality of the staff. Typical menu of soup, salad, rice, veggies, noodles and choice of meat around $18 for single, and $21 for combo. 

When we arrived, the soup came out just as we sat down, then the waitress took our drink order. A little odd and rushed, but I moved on and enjoyed the soup. Next was the salad which came with a choice of ginger dressing or ranch. Unfortunately, it seemed like the salad w/dressing was sitting around for pre-made with dressing on top. Ginger dressing was chunky and watery...had one bite and set it to the side. 

Next came the rice and veggies. To my surprise, the chef cooked everything at once and it wasn't done with the same excitement and precision as other steakhouses I've been to. After the rice, veggies and meat came the noodles...all piled on the same plate. I prefer the rice to be in a separate bowl, but well. 

Overall...just OK. The chef was OK and the food was OK...gots of leftovers as always. They also get you in and out in less than an hour...some might feel rushed, but it felt OK to me as I wasn't able to eat that much because I didn't have a break in between the cooking of other items...it was all piled on."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge hibachi fan, but my husband loves it.  This place has really good hibachi, if you're into that.  You get a ton of food.  The chef put on a good show.  Actually, after he was done cooking, he told me that he had accidentally shorted me on shrimp and that they were cooking more in the back to bring out to me.  I was really impressed with his honesty, because I never would have noticed that he hadn't given me enough.
The service was great, too.  My drink never got low.  My only complaint is that it's pretty expensive.  The next time my husband craves hibachi though, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We arrived at 8 and were told that it would be a 30 minute wait. I left a birthday cake with the hostess and she told me she'd take care of the rest. We sat at the bar while we waited for a table. We ended up waiting over an hour just to be seated. When we were seated, it took the server 10 minutes to finally get our drink orders and another 10-15 to bring it to our table. Mind you, it's around 9:45 Wednesday evening at this time. The chef didn't come out until 10:00ish, after the restaurant has closed. He tried his best, but it was evident he was done for the night. No one ever brought our cake out- our server simply said no one informed her it was a birthday celebration, but the chef somehow knew? As soon as he finished cleaning the grill, the server brought us all to-go boxes, as if she wanted to rush us out the door. We were so disappointed and tired, we just put the food away and left. 

To make our night even worse, by the time we got home at 11, every one of us had an upset stomach from the bit of food we did eat. 
Wasted 3 hours and $200. Next time, we'll stick Fuji or even US Sushi."}
{"text":"This locally owned family restaurant has been a favorite amongst University Area residents for years now.  Located just across from the University, in the back of the Harris Teeter, Kabuto's is probably the best Japanese style Hibachi and Sushi spot in the University City Bubble.

I LOVE their sushi.  Their fresh-water eel is unmatched.  I also love their California roll (sometimes I add salmon to it).  The sushi is always made fresh to order.  The rice is always soft and the wasabi is strong just the way I like it.

Although I am partial to the sushi bar located in the front of the restaurant, I have on the rare occasion, sat in the back, and partaken of the hibachi experience their fun and entertaining chiefs put on.  The experience is always entertaining and the food is always above-par. 

There's nothing not to like about this place.  The service is ALWAYS exceptional.  I have been here well over 50 times in my time in Charlotte and have never had poor service here.  There is always plenty of parking located directly in front of the restaurant.  

Kabuto's is one of those rare establishments in the University Area that are worth driving to if you don't live in the University City Bubble.  Though I don't live in the UCB anymore, Kabuto's is one of the few places that I still return to dine at on a regular basis. 

EAT AT KABUTO'S!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love japanese and i'm always looking for a place that isn't too expensive but tastes great...well i found it!  kabutos has become my weekly spot and one of my favorite places to dine.  the soup is tasty and the teriyaki chicken is top notch!!   portion sizes are enormous so you def. get what you pay for!!  they also put on a great show so for those who like a little entertainment with their meal.  the staff is very nice and friendly.  my food is always made to perfection, drinks always full and the staff treats me like family.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Word of mouth made me skeptical of this place but in not one to shy away from a restaurant because of what people say. 

The restaurant- it's what you would expect of an establishment on this side of town. Bigger than what I thought. Nice little setup though.

The show- not as impressive as other Japanese restaurants I've been to. While the guy talked to is a lot and made us laugh, I didn't see much flying through the air like I'd hoped.

The food- fried rice and the steak was good. He cooked it to a nice medium rare, suggested a mustard sauce that was incredible paired up with it"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!  Today was my daughter's birthday and she love this place so I took her here. We did not know that there was a minimum person count before they use the teppanyaki grill. Since there were only two of us, the waitress informed us they would not be able to accommodate. Of course that broke my daughter's heart as this was one of the reasons she loved this place (and the food of course). She started tearing up. I felt horrible because her weekend party was cancelled due to none of her friends were able to make it (summer birthdays are the worst) The staff at Kabuto decided to do the performance with the teppanyaki grill. This was the best gift they could have given my daughter. I will be a regular customer and definitely will recommend. Btw the food was delicious."}
{"text":"1/2 price sushi on Wednesday's and Thursday's! Try the earthquake roll and add eel sauce (& siracha if you like a kick)! It'll change your life. 

Great staff!"}
{"text":"Food -- 4 stars
Hibachi grill was good. I had Filet and Shrimp and I thought it was very tasty. The chef wasn't a Hibachi entertainment pro, but he got the food tasting good and that is the most important thing.

Service -- 1 star
Service was mediocre. For my party, the waiting staff consistly gaffed on our orders. One colleague wanted steamed rice but didnt get it. Another colleague received a beer with a cracked bottle lip, and almost cut herself. I ordered an appetizer and never got. While the staff was apologetic about the missing appetizer, the bottle incident was handled very poorly and left a very negative feeling from my coworker.

***HOWEVER, the night I went there was a frat pledge party so with 100+ hormonal college kids wrecking havoc, I would give the staff a pass on that. They were managed decently well, but we were left out in terms of quality service. 

Atmosphere -- 2 stars
Meh."}
{"text":"Great food!  Try the mustard sauce! Great lunch spot. They will cook for one in the dining room or at the hibachi tables if nobody else comes in within ten min on a weekday!"}
{"text":"Wednesday nights and Thursday nights. 50% sushi discount. Need I say more?

Going in there the vibe was busy, because people know where to go to eat sushi. Some of the tables in the sushi area is a bit small, but overall, when people leave and clear out the seats open up. I had 2 other people with me when we went. The selection of special sushi of course isn't written up, so the trick here is to ask the waiter what off menu specials there are.

There are special rolls on the back on a white board, but that could be a little bigger to attract the customer's eyes and so it can be ordered more often instead of looking at the paper where customers usually order sushi. The dragon roll my friend ordered, she enjoyed it.

Overall though, I have definitely come here more than once because of the 50% discount and I have eaten my fair share of sushi here. I recommend to try out the hibachi grill as well they have in the back."}
{"text":"Delicious Japanese food and crazy fast service. As your seated for dinner your soup is immediately given to you as the waitress takes your drink orders. The amount of food the chef prepares for you is enough for 2 meals! I love that I always bring home a leftover box. I'm not a vegetable fan, but the chicken and steak is always cooked how I like it. My drink is always kept filled and the managers are always walking around the restaurant making sure everyone is kept happy. Marten and his brother really make you feel welcomed and they definitely remember returning customers, which I love!! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I'm home alone tonight so I decided to treat myself. I ordered filet mignon and chicken combo. I didn't get any soup- I guess they don't know how to do soup for take-out.  I'm not sure if I actually got filet instead of sirloin or strip- it was cooked beyond any recognition of cut, even though I ordered it medium. The ginger sauce on my lettuce (not really salad- just iceburg lettuce) wasn't good to me, but that may just be my taste. The chicken was pretty dry too.

The rice and vegetables were pretty decent. Overall though I was so let down and would not return."}
{"text":"Great place! Very entertaining!   Both the sushi and hibachi are excellent.....family owned too, and the owners seem to always be there involved with the restaurant...I can definitely appreciate that."}
{"text":"Great quick fix for sushi! Wednesday and Thursday 50% off sushi cannot be beat! Quick service and relaxed atmosphere. 

I ordered two of their specialty rolls: dragon roll and Carolina Sunrise. Decent for the price but the dragon roll tasted a bit bland. The crab salad on top of the Carolina Sunrise had a bit of wasabi kick to it. I was expecting more of a volcano roll crab salad on top but this was a nice surprise. 

My cousin got the lucky 7 and jack pot rolls. Lucky 7 really hit the spot! Most of their specialty rolls consisted of shrimp tempura."}
{"text":"I go here most Thursdays for sushi. Pablo is the best sushi chef. He bows what I like and don't like. He makes rolls that he knows I will enjoy. He makes sure my water is always refilled and I have the things I need. The servers also know my order and always provide me with a salad. The ginger dressing is scrumptious. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Loved our experience at this Kabuto's. The manager was super polite and hilarious. I was impressed by the signs on the door courteously reminding everyone of the dress code, take your hood down and stuff of the like. The food as always was banging. Server was prompt and professional. Will always stop by for lunch when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I love Japanese steak houses. It's a lot of fun, and I love the theatricality in addition to the good food. Nothing in life is a delicious as ginger sauce, so that helps as well, and they're always accommodating for vegetarians. 

I think Kabuto is a great option for a first date. You can talk to each other some, but if it's getting a little lame or if there's not chemistry, you can focus all your attention on the performance. It's also a lot of fun when my niece is visiting with the family, as she enjoys the fire and the food-tossing and all. The menu has enough variety to satisfy picky kid's appetites, and the show keeps them from getting too fussy, even as the evil bedtime witching hour approaches."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with some friends who are big fans for Sushi and it was delicious! I have been craving Sushi like crazy and this was more than satisfying. We had the Bagel Roll and NFL roll but the Earthquake roll was my favorite. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has been my favorite Japanese Hibachi grill for years. The service is great and I love the cooks little show that they put on. Recently I visited with my four children to celebrate my two oldest childrens birthday. I will say this last time I went the food seemed underseasoned so for that I am only giving them four stars. Also the gratuity that was added in was 17 dollars which is a meal so I was highly upset about that because I didn't receive 17 dollar food and service. I would come back because the biggest issue I had was the food seasoning or lack there of and that can easily be corrected with my suggestion of adding more while they are cooking it."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a VERY LONG TIME, and after dinner for a friends birthday I see why. She came for her birthday during the 50off sushi and boy the quality was very poor. And presentation was awful as well, but the service was ok. It was horrible that we had to wait until the ENTIRE party arrived, and there was absolutely no one in the restaurant. Like it made no sense! I won't be going back unless it's a birthday party for someone and if it is I'll order water. 

Not Pleased"}
{"text":"Awful service!!! Weren't given drinks, soup, or salad until after the hibachi was ready. I don't know what's happened to this place but we won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was very good . The waitress was very inventive . The only thing is my I felt so sick after eating it . I'm not sure if it's just my stomach not being able to handle it or what but I felt terrible . The staff at the front was very friendly and talkative"}
{"text":"Although I went on a Weds. Night for the half off sushi I ended up with a shrimp hibachi meal that I could not even finish! Overall the food was very good and I had plenty of left overs to eat the next day . Our cook was really nice and did all of the normal tricks and what not. I did expect a bigger restaurant when I walked in but I guess it's a good amount of space! It seemed like they had maybe 4 or 5 hibachi tables and then other normal dining room tables for non-hibachi patrons. The table behind us seemed to have an issue with their cook but it looked like the manager took care of that quickly. Overall I would come back it's a decent priced hibachi meal with quick service. The parking in front of the restaurant seems a bit tight not sure if there was more in the back but I can only imagine what it's like on a fri sat night!"}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had at any restaurant and the manager could care less about it..  We were sat and it too our server 15 mins to come to the table and when she came she came with the soup and no beverages because she never came to get an order.  We ordered the dragon roll and a combination with all 3 meats sub filet and she messed that up.  While the chef was cooking I inquired about our sushi and that's when we were informed that the sushi chefs had left for the day.  The server sends the manager and he looks at us as if we did something wrong.  I have never in my life seen such blatant disregard for poor service.  If there is a corporate office I hope this reaches it.  You guys were horrible.."}
{"text":"Went for the 50% off sushi on Wednesdays(it's also on Thursdays both lunch and dinner) and I was pleasantly surprised. The sushi was awesome and fresh, and all sushi is included in the 50% deal, no limited menus or restrictions. I've been trying to find decent, budget friendly sushi since I moved to Charlotte, and this is by far one of my top choices. They don't have too many specialty rolls, so if you're looking for extravagant sushi you won't find it here, but still a solid sushi menu and just enough specialty rolls to make it worth it. I sat in the sushi bar area which is small but I believe they have more seating in the back at hibachi stations. Over all go on a Wednesday or Thursday for a good deal!"}
{"text":"Though our kids tend to order a cheeseburger or chicken tenders off of the kids menu no matter where we go, they like the Japanese Steak House.  Probably because they get distracted by the guy who tosses things around and sets stuff on fire so much that they forget that they aren't eating cheeseburgers and chicken tenders.  I don't know, really, but it at least gets something a little different in them, so we can't complain.

The local chain probably won't stand up to a Benihana or anything, but we don't have one nearby anyway, so it doesn't really matter much.  The food is pretty decent and the show is generally entertaining.  You can never really tell if the chefs are so good that they can act like they don't know what they are doing or if they are just that clumsy.

Only one complaint is that this location has started serving spaghetti-like nooodles on top of the fried rice, and they just don't mix all that well.  It's not that they taste bad, as they don't.  They just don't blend."}
{"text":"On my never ending quest to find the best Japanese steakhouse in Charlotte, hubs and I ventured into Kabuto on a random weekday evening. 

At first blush, this particular Kabuto isn't necessarily impressive from the outside or inside. When you walk in there is a room with a decent sized bar and a smattering of tables for the sushi eaters or hibachi haters - you choose. Since I was in the mood for a show, we choose to have the whole \"experience\" of hibachi and we led in the back room with eight or so double hibachi tables. 

The menu is standard Japanese hibachi, running $15-$23 for your choice of protein(s). The accompaniments support the shoveling of food: clear/green onion soup, ginger salad, shrimp appetizer (2 shrimp) fried rice, vegetables, noodles and your choice of proteins. So...where did Kabuto falter a bit? The service was pretty solid, the hibachi show was mildly entertainment, but the food...was uninspired. Don't get me wrong, it was fine. But when I see a talented hibachi chef using big pads of butter to cook all of my food, it turns me off. Thus the food tasted like bland butter, not the crispy, tasty, fresh hibachi I love (where they typically use oil). 

My other minor beef is that the food came out all at once - there was little to no pacing. So, everything butter laden was dumped on my plate. Meh. I'm giving this Kabuto three stars because our server was super attentive and the food was fine, but not great. However, I don't think I'll be back considering I enjoyed the whole experience at the other Japanese steakhouse just down the road."}
{"text":"Can I just say I absolutely love this place!  I was actually a waitress here back in 2005. I left because I moved back to los Angeles California and yet I have not found a place that is as good as kabutos. They have benihanas out here yet still not up to kabutos level. I would really love to see a kabutos out here! I think I might just take a flight to north Carolina to have some kabutos.  Great owners and staff. Try the shrimp sauce on your rice. The best!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. My friend and I spoke with the owner about the sign on the door, which overtly targets a particular group of people in a discriminatory fashion. The hostess first tried to say this is in line with other places such as grocery stores, which do not allow people to wear hoodies. This is a LIE and is completely ridiculous (As are most excuses for prejudice and discrimination). The owner then tried to say customers don't want to see someone's underwear while eating. Since he tried to act like this was about modesty for the good of customers, we asked what his policy was on women wear extremely low cut shirts. He joked he would give them a discount. So the owner feels the need to express racist and sexist views. I will not be patronizing this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to Kabuto in Charlotte's University area with my previous boss today.  The service was wonderful, the staff made sure I was happy and the food was wonderful!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and son for lunch. We were seated immediately as always and greeted promptly by our waiter. He was friendly and attentive and it's always a plus when they acknowledge the little ones. Even though they don't have to, greeting the children helps them to feel welcomed as well. Out of all of our visits here, this was the first time that our food was too salty. I was surprised because it's typically spot on in terms of seasoning. I will note that the chef was having a difficult time seeing whether or not any salt was coming out of the shaker...

The food is reasonably priced and much cheaper than the dinner menu. I will say that the restaurant could use some upgrades. The carpet is sticky and reminds me of the skating rink for some odd reason. I would recommend this restaurant for lunch, but can't say the higher dinner  prices are worth the money."}
{"text":"Pablo and the sushi crew are amazing. I eat here weekly in order to get my sushi fix. There is always ample parking and the hostess seats us quickly. They will provide you with a regular sushi menu however be sure to request the speciality menu too. I start off by having a salad with soy-ginger dressing, then some specialty rolls with soy sauce, eel sauce and shrimp sauce in the dipping dishes. Generally I have water so I don't convolute my sushi experience. 

Throughout my weekly dining experience Pablo and the sushi crew are attentive, courteous and friendly. They even throw in some great laughs. Occasionally the owner who is generally hard at work includes a few interesting stories about the Japanese art in the sushi area. 

I started coming for the sushi and now I stay for the people and the sushi."}
{"text":"We had reservations on Valentine's night, and even though it was for 8, we were sat closer to 9. However, this is partially assumed in busy holiday occasions. The servers were all friendly, and helpful. Checking on the possibility of substituting something out, and making sure drinks were filled. The chef was amusing and had our food cooked to order quickly, and still put on a show. (I had ordered the filet and shrimp) 
My only complaint, and this wasn't something the restaurant could have helped, was the party that was sat at the table with us."}
{"text":"If you like the feel of eating off the floor of a sticky movie theater, then this is your place. Nothing like it used to be back in the day. Go to Nakatos down the street for a better experience. Food was so so and the experience was disappointing, prob won't go back, even if it was free."}
{"text":"Been going here for over six years.   99% of the time, food great, service great.   Regular customer on Sunday."}
{"text":"Came for their special the 50% off sushi on Wednesday and as soon as I walked in I was greeted I'm not sure the guys name but he seem like he's the manager he was very nice very attentive the food was ready fast he continuously called me by my first name so it was a very personal experience and excellent great Customer Service I will continue to come back for the quality food and quality service this is a place that definitely gets five stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. It's your average show hibachi. Ours was not that great because there was a small child at the table who was terrified of the loud noise and the flames. They did take her outside. The plum wine was delicious! If you want good hibachi and have the extra cash I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"friently staff, good half price sushi on wed &thru. great place ..Sushi and beer ,,what else can you ask for!"}
{"text":"My sister and I come here quite often, on the half price days. If I could rate it a 2.5 I would've and here's why:
1. When you walk in the girl at the podium just stands there like a vegetable with a disgusted look on her face like she doesn't want to do her job. 

2. The rest of the wait staff EXCEPT a girl and a guy (I can't recall their names) are horrible because they always have nasty attitudes. They need to be fired and the manager needs to hire people that are energetic, happy, and actually want to work there. 

3. I have never gotten hibachi however when you're getting sushi and sit down sometimes they take forever to bring you menus and take your drink order. 

TIP: ALWAYS HAVE PABLO MAKE YOUR SUSHI, NEVER THE OTHER GUY! He never cleans his station and when he made my sushi once it was absolutely disgusting. I don't know how he is still working there, Pablo always uses fresh ingredients and makes everything perfectly.

4. They NEVER give you enough shrimp sauce.

Other than those things, the sushi that Pablo makes is wonderful and is the only reason I come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"the manager is a liar and pretty much  take your complaint as a joke . he refuse to give his real name after i told him i was doing a yelp review on the device i received today.  don't not eat here..the attitudes sucks of the staff and some of the mix drinks and food ."}
{"text":"Nothing too exciting on the outside, I probably wouldn't have given Kabuto a shot  if it wasn't a UNCC hot stop for its half off sushi. Every Wednesday & Thursday they offer half off all the sushi/rolls- an awesome steal, it was the only thing ever getting me through my night class! Everything is always fresh-double points for fresh sushi. 
I'll explain my 5 star rating in a quick second! I live right down the road from this place and It is weekly staple for my friends and I- even though I always forget to 'check in'.I think I just don't want my yelp friends to see how much I eat here! Since Yelp prides itself on local business- the two owners alone deserve 5 stars. Every night you will find both owners socializing with guests, filling drinks and even making rolls behind the bar- talk about hands on! 
I can only review on the sushi portion since I haven't made it past the sushi bar in years. 
If you're an adventurous sushi eater you must order off the specialty roll menu go for the Jackpot,Carolina , Harris or Arizona rolls- they won't disappoint! If you're looking for  something simple, spicy tuna always hits the spot. 
If you're going to eat on a Wednesday or Thursday service my be a little slow- any other night, the sushi bar has always been speedy. 
You can't pass up a sushi meal for 10-15 bucks!  Always a satisfying, fun and easy night out. Nothing too fancy! 
See you next week..."}
