{"text":"My first to times here were dismal and disappointing at best. Decided to give it one more try and I am glad I did. The service was fantastic and the food was awesome! I will definitely be back! Thank you Ms. Jackie...."}
{"text":"Had brunch that was scrumptious 
Service was impeccable
Great to have a dependable late night place"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. The place was virtually empty yet it still took 20 minutes after ordering to get beers. My friend twice asked for a glass of water which never came. 
The food was tasteless and stodgy. We asked to see the manager who came to the table with an awful attitude telling us the kitchen was backed up - despite the lack of customers."}
{"text":"I would love to put this place down as a lunch option, but when I called for the lunch specials, the hostess(or maybe not hostess) that picked up the phone was very rude and unprofessional right off the bat. After just hearing this I have no desire to even step into the restaurant.  It really is a shame that there would be such an awesome chef, but not invest in the front of the house on service."}
{"text":"Really bad menu and certainly doesn't match the interior and scene of the restaurant.

Service took forever and the cost is way too high for the food. We got the veggie kebob...could have made it at home for less than $12!!! 

Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Goodfood great people every thing ive had there was great...the chef and owner are good people the bartenders are great and the atmosphere is wonderful and im goin to make it a regular spot to eat an drink"}
{"text":"Walked in. Weren't acknowledge.

Once seated, weren't given menus.

We were literally told, \"We have everything\".

After being told they had local brews, it was surprising not to find a single cider- local or not.

Tried to order a Pino Noir. Nope. and a Mojito. Nope. No white rum? Titos? Nope.

It was then that I asked what time they closed, \"well, actually 4am. . .\"

Ummmmmm what!?!?

It was only 11:30pm, and we were treated like they were closing at midnight!!

The server went on to say this was their 3 day, soooooo yeah. . 

At this point, it was time to go. Absolutely ridiculous.

As we were leaving, some folks asked if we were complaining . .

I'm over here thinking, nope, not complaining, just heading on over to trusty ol Common Market!"}
{"text":"Terrible service not worth the trip I sent my food back after waiting 20 minutes for my beer and then 45 minutes for my shrimp and grits which only contained five tiny shrimp.
The manager said they where backed up but never apologized once.
Terrible service disappointing food DON'T BOTHER!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I really did. 

Upon entry, the atmosphere is cool and eclectic with a nice spacious patio. My guest and I were greeted by very friend staff. We sat at the bar and ordered drink specials...peach margarita and peach mojito. 

The peach margarita had absolutely no flavor AND I had a speck of something black floating in it. The bartender was nice about it and prepared a strawberry margarita as a replacement. It was subpar as well. 

While waiting on our order, I noticed that the kitchen seemed a bit disorganized. It's possible that it was a bad day but it seemed a bit unusual.

The food was...well just ok. I had the Cajun shrimp basket which was average and consisted of fried jumbo shrimp and fries with Cajun seasoning. However, my friend had the curry chicken which left much to be desired. It was replaced with the lemon pepper wings which were also average. 

Overall, the experience was average. Not sure I will return as there are other options in the area. But, the staff were really nice!"}
{"text":"I actually give my first experience at the Factory Cafe a 2.8. I had heard great things and I was excited about going; especially after I previewed the menu. We went kind of late (after 9) on a Wednesday and it was dead but it was still great. I absolutely love the decor and potential atmosphere. Our waitress was nice but lacked basic  waiting skills. We sat with dirty plates in front of us while she stood right across from us. The food was just ok. We had the mussels and fried fewen tomatoes to start. The mussels were very good. The FGT's were just ok, well a little disappointing because people raved about them. We also ordered the Salmon and Shrimp in grits. The shrimp and grits were tasty even though the shrimp was way over cooked. The salmon was very tender and had a different and unique flavor. Overall I dont know that I would go back of my own choice."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. Not sure why it's called a cafe, they served me luke warm coffee that was made 12 yours ago. I could go on but just save yourself the time and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"This place has very expensive drinks (3 drinks = $31).  The bartender was nice but the place was unorganized. Everyone seemed so frazzled and confused. 

The remaining bartending staff seemed engaged in personal conversations with friends more so  than being attentive to paying customers.

The crowd was very young and this place was not my original pick. The jazz bar next door was closed so we stopped in here.

I didn't sample the food but it looked decent with large portions.

Will I return?? NAH!!!

I enjoy places with more seasoned clientele however, if you are in your early twenties you may want to stop in."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant to add to the music factory. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. For an appetizer I ordered the duck egg rolls. These were great for sharing and the flavor was amazing! The duck was not over cooked or overpowering, and it came with a great dipping sauce. For my lunch entree I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak. The steak was flavored very well, but the cheese on top was not your typical cheese sauce for Philly cheesesteaks. Overall the food here is very good and I would like to come back again."}
{"text":"I don't plan on going back...the service was extremely slow. We ate here before seeing a concert at the Filmore and it took ~30 minutes after we ordered just for our food to come out. I would understand if it were busy but aside from the 3 of us, there were only 4 other people eating dinner there. I don't know why it took so long. It's not even like they were understaffed...the employees were just alking to one another and seemed to forget they were *supposed to be* serving customers. 

As far as food quality...I looked up the online menu ahead of time that day but for whatever reason, their menu was far more limited in person. The salad was rather pitiful and the fries left much to be desired. Please enhance the menu and just make better food."}
{"text":"The bartender, D is great at his job! And the manager, Liz is so upbeat and ready to help! Very satisfied with the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My first time eating at the Factory Cafe was wonderful, the staff was very attentive and the food was delightfully delicious. I was there for lunch and had the Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich and fries, the portions are enough for 2 people, but I managed it by myself!!"}
{"text":"Worst service experience I've ever had in my life. Showed up just before 8 with a party of 6. There were less than 10 other people in the restaurant. 

Sat down and ordered 6 drinks. Simple ones like dirty martinis, a glass of wine. 25 minutes later, our drinks hadn't arrived and we had to ask the waitress for them. There were at least two people behind the bar. What we're they doing?

Ordered a couple appetizers and 12 sliders. 

Calamari came out and no one had utensils or plates. The appetizers came out slowly. They also forgot a couple of the sliders we ordered. 

The food was only okay and kind of expensive. I don't see this restaurant turning itself around without a major overhaul."}
{"text":"Please save yourself the hassle of going to this \"restaurant\" and find a place that has good service a food elsewhere.  

Here's our story:

Drop off our daughter for a concert and decide to get a bite while at the NC Music Factory.  Decide we'll try the Factory Cafe because it's close.  Wait staff inside restaurant are very friendly.  We eat outside and get a server that refuses to write our order down.  My wife got a sweet tea instead of her unsweetened tea and some kind of spicy turkey sandwich instead of a turkey club.  Waitress takes sandwich back and they take sandwich innards and put it in a wrap (still wrong ingredients).  Both salads we purchased were served in dirty bowls.  The final straw was the $8 strawberry margarita that was nothing more than a .79 Slurpee (no or little alcohol).  My chorizo slider was a spicy, mushy mess.

There are more and better choices than the Factory Cafe in the NC Music Factory.  This is a shame because we met the owner several months ago and she was so nice.  We wanted this to work and we were so disappointed."}
{"text":"Although, the ambiance is nice; I would encourage any large groups to avoid this place. It took over and hour for some of us to receive some of our food and most of us cancelled our orders because the plates were coming out individually at 20 minute intervals. There were no apologies and nothing but excuses. Save yourself the frustration."}
{"text":"Very nice service! The food was good, wasn't expecting whole wings but they were cooked every well.
 Would maybe suggest a bigger menu for late night."}
{"text":"Don't go here before a concert!! My friend and I waited 50 minutes for some side dishes to share. We were told the kitchen was backed up with so many other orders...and there were maybe 10 people in the entire restaurant? Our server offered minimal apology and no offer to cover our drinks. I can't rate the food because we never got it! I will be very surprised if this place makes it. I think it's a sinking ship, sadly enough."}
{"text":"How does the Music Factory continue to attract totally mediocre restaurants with serious service problems? The many iterations of Mexican restaurants, the sushi restaurant that was in this same spot prior and now Factory Cafe. I'll never get it. But, I'll tell you what... They all better step up their game before AvidXchange employees move in full force this summer or they're going to be in trouble. 

Service was painfully slow on our lunch visit. Despite an almost empty restaurant, we waited to be seated. We then waited for menus. We waited to place a drink order. Then... yep!... you guessed it. Waited for our drinks. Waited a little longer to place our orders. The longest wait of all came for our food. We ordered the nachos as an appetizer. They came with our salads despite our request for them to come first. That's right, folks. We ordered nachos and salads -- two of the fastest things to make -- and waited almost half an hour for our food. 

I don't mind waiting a while for good food. Sadly, good this food was not. The nachos were cold, soggy and pretty flavorless all around. They came topped with unseasoned ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes and a funky cheese sauce. The chips were out of a bag and on the wrong side of stale. My shrimp salad was a huge disappointment and a really expensive one at $14.00. It had arugula, un-ripe watermelon, raw onions and 6 over cooked shrimp. The shrimp had the tails on still, totally unappetizing and hard to eat on a salad. The dressing -- supposedly a lime vinaigrette -- came on the side and tasted like plain old oil and vinegar. 

Our waitress was sweet, which is the only thing that kept us from walking out and just ordering Postmates. Do yourselves a favor and just eat before heading to the Music Factory. Hell, I'd even suggest packing a lunch over visiting any of the current restaurants."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this spot at first.  Haven't had much luck with food at the Music Factory.  After looking over the menu, me and my buddy were both in agreement that \"I hope they let us order off the lunch menu\" (we were there at 7pm) which had some tasty sounding options like \"Duck Egg Rolls\".  Unfortunately that wasn't an option.  Might be something they should look into! At least adding some of their better lunch items to the dinner menu. 

On to what i did like....Since the lunch menu wasn't an option, we decided to order 3 Apps and a side.  I have to say, everything was delicious! 

Deviled Eggs: some of the best i've had

Wings: I'm not a fan of full wings...i prefer regular flats and drums, put i won't punish them on it, since their Cheerwine BBQ sauce was so good!  

Calamari:  not great, but not bad.  The sauce was good.  I would get it again....

Mac n cheese shells: above average mac and plenty of it! 

Complimentary corn bread in honey syrup: Delicious!  

Just one tip to management.  Our waitress was a sweetheart, but she should have told us the specials.  We didn't find out until we saw the board on the way out."}
{"text":"Meet with family to eat here on Sunday around 2pm. The entrance was locked and it appeared to be closed, even though operating hours indicated it should be open. Was not able to experience this spot. Really disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"My Go to Spot!! Drinks are incredible!! Ask for Chris..Chicken wings are out of control!!"}
{"text":"The vibe here was such so good! The bartender and workers were very nice! Went the night my two best friends got married and the bartender gave us a free shot! The waffle fries were made just right! The sliders are 3 for 10, please keep in mind that they are VERY small! So it makes sense to get a meal. The sliders weren't too good, so next time I will try another food option. Our time there the music playlist was really lively and music we all enjoyed and we sang too!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I frequent here often because it is near my work, but this will be the last time.

I can always count on them to mess up my order or wait 45+ minutes to get my food. 

Never again.."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat within the Music Factory. Amazing staff, very cool ambiance, reasonable prices and WONDERFUL food!!! Will come back with all my friends--"}
{"text":"This was our first time exploring music factory area and we decided to visit factory cafe.  When we entered although the sign said \"wait to be seated\" no one came to seat us so we sat ourselves at the bar. Although it wasn't that crowded it took about 4 minutes for someone to greet us for drink orders. We ordered the 3 sliders (salmon and crab) and also the shrimp basket. We waited about 25 minutes for our food, had to ask for utensils and condiments. The food was bland, cold and not tasty at all. The shrimp were over breaded and the crab cake slider was seasoned horribly (one bite and I tossed it).  I ordered fries with my sliders and had to wait for those. The only highlight was the margarita (I ordered mango and received peach but ok. I asked for my check, received the one to sign but no copy. I didn't even apply the 10% yelp coupon I had because I just wanted to go. If I go back it will be for drinks only. For $38 dollars I could have gone to the Mexican restaurant next door.  Bad experience."}
{"text":"The food is terrible! Don't come here. 
Under seasoned and not fresh. Everything we ate was disgusting."}
{"text":"The restaurant is newly opened meaning its on its 3rd week. The food was good especially the cornbread. Honestly by the restaurant being so new the menus food and drinks were not all listed but the waitress was very knowledgeable about what they offer.  Its in the heart of NC Music factory right beside Club one as stay open until 3am. the location is great if you go before or after an event in the area. we met the owner and he had a great personality. I would definitely visit again to see how the service is after its been opened for a little while and the menus are update. But it was worth the visit. They currently have a day party on Saturdays where a DJ play and its perfect right now being that NBA playoff time because they have enough TVs for everyone to see the games."}
{"text":"My friend made a reservation to host her birthday brunch months ago. She spoke to the manager/owner on several occasions about her idea of setup, logistics etc. The day of the event not only were the tables not set up she was told by the hostess that they were only expecting a party of 8. She moved the tables to accommodate her large party with no help from staff. Some of us ordered mimosas. They came slowly, one at a time. I would recommend purchasing a serving tray. We patiently  waited an hour and a half for food. A few orders came out in no specific order. One party was given French toast made from sourdough bread, another person received  French toast made from regular sliced bread. The manager gave an excuse but no real apology for the total mishap.  I hope they are able to work their many kinks to survive the restaurant business."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. I came over for breakfast since it is walking distance from my job. I ordered the meat lovers omelette and a bagel as a side. The service is just okay. No one seems to know or understand the menu. I wanted wheat bread with my breakfast but they didn't have any so I settled for an English muffin. The menu items are kind of pricy but I guess they are priced that way because of the location that it is in. The cook didn't know that the omelette came with home fits so I had to wait a little longer, but everything turned out fine. 

The ambience is nice. Very relaxing. It is not the biggest place but it seems like it is nice plus you can also sit outside. You can see directly into the kitchen as they cook which is something I love about a place that I keep. 

There are desserts on the bar. It looks like the red velvet cake is from yesterday because some of the icing is coming off of the side probably due to humidity or something. It does look moist. 

There's a fully stocked bar and there are drink specials. The prices are along the lines of what you would probably pay if you're uptown Charlotte but since the Music Factory is starting to boom, then I can understand the pricing."}
{"text":"My wife went to this restaurant last night and came home astonished by the service . First off , the service was horrible ! I can say I purely blame everything entirely on management ! We waited 30 mins for an appetizer that never came .  We were told that the restaurant was out of calamari and also ribs . Any other day ; this would not have been an issue however , considering the fact that that was our only option it was horrible . Now , this all took place on a Saturday night around 10'o'clock .  This restaurant is suppose to be open all night to be conducive with the night life surrounding it . My experience was horrific!  I will never go back here ! I try to support black owned business but due to what I experienced last night I will never visit again ."}
{"text":"I've literally never been to such a horrible cafe. Horrible service and I was served cold coffee that had clearly been sitting out all day. Never visiting again. Since zero stars isn't an option.. just thought everyone deserved a warning. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Tried this place several times. Has its ups and downs, mostly downs. They mess up your order or have you waiting forever for your food. I had great hopes for this place, very disappointing and I won't be visiting again."}
