{"text":"Good food and friendly staff sets this place apart.  The owner, Ben, was very friendly and took the time to \"welcome \" new customers like me.  I don't have to go far for tasty Mexican food.   You can order online too to save time."}
{"text":"Outstanding carne asada chimichanga, was definitely worth the wait. Burrito was excellent. We will be back, thank you Ben."}
{"text":"The service here is awesome they really have amazing customer service and the food is delicious and when they give it to you, it's packed with love!!!"}
{"text":"Went into this taco place awhile back because of the Yelp reviews. I was very excited to try it out. Went in and the employees were friendly. Customer service is there. That all went away while waiting an hour plus for my order and being told that it took that long because they had a phone order. And having customers who ordered after me get their food before me. I honestly think they forgot my order and tried to cover it up by saying it took that long because of a phone order. Food was ok. Same as all the other cheap Mexican places. The wait ruined my experience."}
{"text":"I just wanna say best tacos in Las Vegas!!! I wish there's one closer in Henderson. Excellent customer service and really good food! I will definitively recommend this to my family and friends."}
{"text":"Ingredients - 10 (homemade sauces; rice and beans)  Authenticity - 10 (serves special dishes such as cabeza & lengua)  Customer Service - 11   Food - 10   Fuckin great food"}
{"text":"You love Mexican food? Jeje's is great !!!  Ben and Blanca work hard to make you feel welcome and serve you great food.  I am a Professional Taste Tester ( lol ) and I promise you will be very satisfied !!!"}
{"text":"Wow! I never write a review before, this will be my first but let me tell you guys how I love this place. Very good customer service and food was great. I was craving for  some burritos so my husband yelped out some good mexican place so he came across to this place so we decided to try it out with our kids and let me just tell you it was the best mexican place here in vegas we ever encounter. Manny was very nice and easy to take order from, he really made us feel comfortable and welcomed. Thank you! We will be coming back soon..."}
{"text":"We had the rolled chicken tacos, breakfast burrito, and the steak fries. It was AMAZING!!!!! Food was brought fast and fresh. I will be returning for more! Thx Jefe!"}
{"text":"This is the best place ever! I would give them more than 5 stars..They have Great customer service and Ben treats you like family :D I definitely recommend this taco shop to anybody. It is located in the Sinclair gas station."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great customer service... You have to try this place... Good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Jefe's tacos are awesome and the people are so nice! I sure will be glad when they get a better location. I will go and invite friends."}
{"text":"We were so excited to come to eat at Jefe's tacos because of 5 star reviews, customer service was okay waited maybe 20 min, the food wasn't fresh so dissapointed we ordered 3 mini carna asada tacos,torta,california burrito and 2 al pastor 1 carne asada tacos. It was our first time I gave her my name and birthday she said I will receive something free on my bday, we got a free agua de limon it was okay! Maybe next time the food will taste better who knows not planning on returning!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me pre-warn you about the sheer size of the burrito!  Prepare for the ever satisfying food coma!!  After hearing my parents (Perreira Family) rave about this place, I was finally able to try it out when I was in town for the holidays.  Ordered the carne asada burrito.  Normally I would omit the pico de gallo from burritos, but I decided to try this as they served it.  I was not disappointed!!  The meat had a great tangy flavor with a nice char.  Pico de gallo and guacamole was fresh and the veggies had a great snap to it.  This was all balanced out with the spanish rice and refried beans.  Insider tip, after each bite, squeeze a bit of lime and pour a touch of red or green salsa.  Before indulging, I busted out the kitchen scale.  This behemoth tipped the scale at a whopping 1lb10oz.  Halfway through, my arm was getting tired of hoisting this massive burrito.  It was really starting to hit me that I was full!  But I would not surrender!  I had to conquer this food challenge before me.  I pressed forward.  Finally made it to the final couple bites.  While holding the burrito vertical, all the juices from the meat as well as the lime juice settled at the bottom.  Upon biting into the bottom row, the flood gates of the Flavortown Dam opened up!  It now became a race against time to finish the bottom before all the juices ran out.  I caught my 2nd wind and pushed through to the end!  I then rolled away from the table and onto the couch where I promptly fell asleep!"}
{"text":"funny that he keeps deleting this particular post. the negative comments have nothing to do with his food but all about his customer service. I will keep posting it so that people can see. even if I have to do it under a different name. so I've been coming to the taco shop for quite some time now. I would always come into the store but I never tried anything. once I finally did I was HOOKED !! the carne Asada is my favorite. I've tried the al pastor, carnitas, and chicken as well as the mini tacos. none of which I would get again because there are better places in Las Vegas that serve this. although it may be good to some. it's just not for me. as much as I love Jefe's taco shop, I will NO LONGER be returning. Ben the manager/owner insulted my mother because I gave her honest opinion on the mini taco shells. in her opinion they are nasty. people in Las Vegas are used to white corn tortillas. that's all. what really got me is that he told me my mother does not know good food and she eats garbage and cardboard. I listen as he insults the competition around town which is fine but to insult ones mother and to think that it acceptable is NOT OKAY. EVEN when it's in a joking manor. the joked continues to go as I wouldn't allow \"no bad cornbread\" idk if I'm black so cornbread is associated with me. but I don't eat cornbread or soul food or fried chicken to add to the bunch. Already having mixed feelings about the taco shop because I could only go after his wife is no longer working considering she makes me uncomfortable with her level of rudeness. I will be telling everyone I know about my experience as I will not be returning after my mothers and my palette has been insulted."}
{"text":"This is THE spot for burritos, the monster breakfast burrito is just that, a monster. Insanely good! Came here for the first time a week ago and had to come back ASAP. Quality and amazing customer service, it's a simple recipe for success that they do perfectly. Go see them now! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Today out of luck I googled closest burrito place while I was working and Jefes Taco Shop was literally a minute away. I'm always weary about trying new burrito places but I was hungry. I end up at a gasoline station with a little taco shop inside, okay. Looked at the menu and order the California burrito. As a pay Ben the owner I assume greets me. He spark up conversation and I find out homie is from SD. Here is where it gets good he tells me he is using the most amazing Santa Fe flour tortillas straight from Otay farms I small market I south SD! This place is light! The burrito was out of this world. Can't believe I found this place! Thanks Ben for making feel like I was back home I will forever be a costumer. Btw gotta let me know when that next delivery of tortillas comes in."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I wish my stomach was bigger to accommodate an entire order of carne asada fries."}
{"text":"Only 5 star Mexican food in Las Vegas for a reason! Amazing staff, great customer service; very attentive and courteous. Ben was taking care of me today. You can really tell he genuinely cares about the satisfaction of his guests.   As for their food, that should a another separate 5 stars entirely. It's amazing and freshly prepared. Great job guys."}
{"text":"Tacos were delicious! Coming from Los Angeles I really had high expectations for this place to be as good as L.A, as it is hard to find on this side a town a good taco place, so after reading so many reviews we gave it a try and LOVED IT! the tacos are delicious!!!!! Salsas were delicious too! One thing I would probably change was for the meat to be just a little more juicy but besides that it was GREAT!!! this will definitely be our taco place FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"Good food, and good service. Wil be back soon!  Just finished eating. Well almost. Large portions, and very filling. You won't come.here for quick service, but you will get good food!  The super fries are awesome!"}
{"text":"Cashier was great and very courteous. Food was delicious. Quantity was not a problem and not stingy. Definitely coming back to try different things. I would recommend this place go anyone."}
{"text":"Almost everyone who writes a review about Jefe's comments on the wonderful quality of the food...and they would be right!  But I wanted to comment on their impeccable honesty and integrity as well.  I submitted an order online and unknowingly overcharged myself by $6.00.   When my wife arrived to pick up the order she was informed of the overcharge and offered sincere apologies and a refund, even though the mistake was technically my fault.  Their honesty gives us yet one more reason to continue to frequent Jefe's and recommend them to anyone who asks us about a great place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"A fantastic example of amazing customer service. Ben personally talked to each of his customers. Greeted me with a handshake. Great guy. First timers received a drink on the house... and it was absolutely delicious. He also added beans and rice along with my order for free to see if I would like them for my next visit.  Well, rest assured, the food was absolutely amazing. I had 3 mini tacos and devoured them so fast. One of the best tacos I've ever had in Vegas.   Since this is in close proximity to where I live, this will probably end up being my go to spot for tacos. Love this place."}
{"text":"From the minute you walk in, Ben greats you with his infectious uplifting personality. Makes you feel like you're family! Split the mega Carne Asada fries with my daughter, have plenty of leftovers. Loved it ! Blows Roberto's away. Thanks Ben, we will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty delicious! The rolled tacos were awesome and the California burrito was great. Service was wonderful. We even ordered a taco to go for my mother in law and the guy gave it to us for free. The only complaint was my husband thought his taco was a little greasy.  We'll definitely come back again"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! We ordered online and it was so easy. The food was so good. Hubby and I both had Carne Asada tacos. Best tacos we have had in a while! I thought the beans were slightly salty but still good. The red salsa will kill you though so watch out! We had great customer service too. Ben talked to us while our food was finishing up and ended up giving us free drinks since it was our first time coming! Will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"This place is my main spot for mexican food. They are always so nice and their customer service is the best I have seen. Their food is completely amazing. I have never been disappointed coming here to eat. I would highly recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Just recently found this place and it has great food! Just polished off a carnitas mulita and enjoyed it.  Their red and green hot sauces are great too.  Thanks!  If you're thinking about try it, go! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place five stars because the food was great and Ben was awesome. I wish it wasn't in a gas station, because my kids were all over the place wanting candy bars, ice cream, etc.  Hopefully, Jefe's will do well and can move to a place with more seating. However, I will definitely be back and get another breakfast burrito (and fajitas for the wife)!"}
{"text":"I came here after three coworkers recommended it. Ben was friendly and really concerned with our happiness with the food he served. I got the chicken rolled tacos combo and my wife got the chicken tamale and chicken taco combo. This was the best quick Mexican food I've ever had here in Vegas. Highly recommend. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best tacos hands down,friendly service the owner Ben is hands on with his customers and explain everything to you about the menu this is my new Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"So good! Currently working on the spicy shrimp taco. I highly recommend it! Everything there has been delicious. The price and the wait are worth the product"}
{"text":"Best food to be in a gas station especially when its a line on a Friday night.. Delivery services would be great!!!"}
{"text":"My goodness! This was the best mexican food I have ever had in Las Vegas. The Carne asada fries were so good, I went twice in one day! My kids loved them and Ben's service was amazing! He is very nice and knows customer service!"}
{"text":"Had my 1st trip there...the food was great..loved meeting ben...will go back often..if you haven't been try it"}
{"text":"The food is amazing customer services beyond the best. They're very personable and just overall great experience. I love local good food,and I can gamble while I wait!!"}
{"text":"I'm from LA and our friends who live here kept talking about this place and brought me and my boyfriend here. It was one of the best California burritos I've ever had in my life. And the biggest!!! We were sad we didn't get to meet Manny. Maybe next time. Cuz we'll be back."}
{"text":"Believe the hype! I had the mini street tacos and the Jefe burrito. They were delicious. I think I\"m hooked. I have to say the Jefe burrito is the best burrito I have ever had. They are totally worth the price.  The service is amazing."}
{"text":"Would like to leave 6 stars but I guess 5 will do. Great food especially the steak fajita plate. Yum! The most friendliest service in town! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Best place for SoCal/Baja style Mexican food in Vegas and it's inside a gas station. Go figure. Ben the owner and his wife are really friendly and will make sure to keep you happy. The food is outstanding and the portions are huge. A bit of advise, call in your order. The food can take a while sometimes because it's fresh and the place can get packed."}
{"text":"Honestly I thought the location was sketchy inside a gas station, also I didn't like that their staff was eating food in their kitchen, there was a smell as well, so I decided to leave and not eat there"}
{"text":"Today was my first time here & Omgggggg. I'm definitely coming back! I had their bipolar al pastor fries/nachos & they were freaking delicious. They also introduced me to mixing their Jamaica & Lemon drink together & Its so refreshing! My first experience was great, The food is great & the people are great!"}
{"text":"Best place ever! Customer Service was excellent! And food is amazing would definitely recommend this spot when you want some bomb food."}
{"text":"I've seen many food places come into this location and not do well cause of the poor food quality and many other issues but this place is different. The staff is always extremely helpful and polite, the prices are truly unbeatable and all the prices on food are including tax which makes things alot simpler. I wanted to give this place a try regardless of the food quality simply cause of how polite and kind the people running it treated me. Later on i found out that the food is very good, I'd even say some of the best authentic mexican food I've had in a while here in vegas. I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"The best taco shop On las Vegas! Friendly people, and the food is very good, I recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even get 1 star! Not because of the food because I didn't get to try it. I drove more than 30 mins just to eat here. Ben knew it was our first time there and he denied us service because he was too busy!! Are you serious with me? Ive never experienced such horrific and ungrateful customer service. He did say if we order online we would be taken care of right away. I didn't know it was an online restaurant. He had the worst attitude. I wish I could upload video. I won't ever recommend this place."}
{"text":"If the food doesn't dazzle you beyond words, mannys exceptional customer service, though I wouldn't call it that cause he's such a cool guy to talk to. Five stars!"}
{"text":"We ate at El Jefe's for the first time tonight. The food was DELICIOUS and the service was AMAZING!!!! We will definitely be going back!! Excited you are on our side of town and we don't have to drive to the east side to get good Mexican food! Saludos a El Jefe!!"}
{"text":"Moved to town a couple of days ago and used the Yelp app to look for something to eat. I came across Jefe's Taco Shop and decided to try it out. I tried the Carne Asada street tacos with refried beans/rice in the side and my wife tried the California burrito bowl. I absolutely loved mine and she said hers was \"spectacular\". It's in a gas station so directions threw me off a bit and I drove right past it, but turned around and managed to figure it out. I met Ben and he was super nice guy and very proud of his creations, as well he should be."}
{"text":"Delicious food and pricing is good. Need a bigger location with more places to sit."}
{"text":"Went to Jefe's yesterday for the first time. Great tacos. My wife and I had lived in southern California for over 45 years and moved to Las Vegas 2 years ago. We are disappointed in the Mexican food in this town. We have tried everything from the most expensive to the cheapest and still can't find anything that comes close to good Mexican food....until now. While only eating tacos (mini street and rolled) we have yet to try the burritos, enchiladas, and rellenos. But judging from the hot sauce, green and red, we won't be disappointed. We wish the seating was separated a little and a better selection of drinks available but the food we had was awesome."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is 100% legit! My wife and I have been wanting to stop by to check this place out because of the great reviews on yelp. I suppose everybody knows by now that it's inside a gas station and there're only a couple of tables. Ben (the owner) is very friendly. Even though it was kinda busy he was taking the time to talk to all the costumers. My wife and I shared the al pastor fries and my daughter had the asada quesadilla. The fries were loaded with meat, very tasty . And my daughter couldn't finish her quesadilla. We are glad we finally stopped by. We are definitely coming back for more. Thanks Ben. You are the man!"}
{"text":"Out of all the taco places I have been to in Vegas, California, Idaho, and Utah, this place is by far my favorite. It doesn't hurt that they also have the friendliest customer service I have ever received. I recommend the Cabeza and Asada mini tacos. 5/5."}
{"text":"I was visiting my brother and he doesn't cook and I didn't want to... I saw Jefe's here and since it was close thought I'd give it a try. Ben (owner?) told me to get on Yelp and tell about the lousy service and bad food.  I can not tell a lie Ben. So I'll say how great the sevice was and holy buckets the size of my Chimi'!  Plus it was delicious!  The seating is very limited so I had to take it out as the table was occupied.  I got back to my brothers and opened the carton and my remark was as stated above.  I dug in and was barely able to finish it along with the rice and beans.  But I can't let good food go to waste...  I wish them the best on their business venture and Ben on his Buick restore.  If you're ever in Alamogordo Ben... open one here!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a whim one day realizing there was a \"taco shop\" in my area.   Upon my entrance I was welcomed by Ben and Blanca (owners) who took time to explain the menu and also some background on the business.  I felt very appreciated as a customer.  I ordered the California burrito and it was HUGE!!  The flavor was amazing and reminded me of the taco shops back home in San Diego.  Come to find out that's where they were from too.  The carne asada was tender with a slight grill flavor. I could only finish half the burrito but it was so delicious that I stuffed the other half down an hour later.  Take the time to stop by Jefe's and you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Both times here have been great. Pollo asado is what I always look for and I had a torta and a California burrito, both great. My man loves the carnitas burrito with rice and beans. Best part is the excellent service. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service at a great price! From now on when I want Mexican food I'm coming to Jefe's Taco shop."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday at 9 and was actually greeted like a person. Food looked great and tasted even better. I ordered the al pastor fries and a chicken burrito. I recommend this place to anybody. Way better than Robertos"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Ordered the carne asada tacos and were some of the best I've had, great flavor. The carnitas were killer too, with a nice little crunch how I like it. Manny is a great host. Can't wait to explore the menu further."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. I'll be back for sure. Don't let the gas station part of it scare you away."}
{"text":"I saw the sign  at the gas staion on my way home from work and decided to give it a try, mainly because I was lazy and didn't want to go home and cook. BEST lazy decision I could have made!!! The food is delicious and the portions are MORE then you would expect. I have eaten there several times and the quality has remained the same....incredible!!!   BEATS ROBERTO'S WITHOUT EVEN TRYING!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been there several times and I just realized that I've never left Ben any feedback reviews.  This place rocks! Hands down, the best Mexican food in the Las Vegas Valley! Even my 11 yr old daughter that doesn't like Mexican food loves this place.  Everything that we have tried, we loved! The last thing I tried was the Jefe Burrito, that was amazing and probably the best burrito I've ever had. It was so big, when I finished it, I needed a nap!  If you're looking for great Mexican food, please give this place a try. You won't be sorry and you'll probably quit eating at some of these high dollar Mexican restaurants!"}
{"text":"Best carne asada fries we've found in Las Vegas. Almost as good as what you get in San Diego. The smaller of the two size options will easily feed 2 people. Everything is made to order so you must be patient for your food. Great customer service. Anytime I'm craving carne asada fries, this is where I'll go to get them in Vegas."}
{"text":"I walked in for my first time, about 20 mins before closing and the staff was incredibly friendly. Instead of just getting ready to close shop the owner came over and explained to me what type of meat they used and the history and the future plans of their business, as well as off topic small talk. I appreciated the convo while waiting for my order.I already can't wait to come back and I haven't even tasted the food yet. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Yes they're in a gas station but who cares. Their customer service is awesome. The owner, his wife, and the rest of the staff make you feel at home. The food is amazing. The Jefe's burrito with chicken, steak, and shrimp has been on my mind every day since I had it and I think I'm addicted. Good food, great people, amazing customer service. If you're in the area stop by this place, or make the drive if you're not in the area, trust me it's worth it. Just moved here from Florida and it's now my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"This is an excellent fast food Mexican restaurant. Except it's not that fast  The meat is delicious and probably the best quality of fast food meat I've ever had for Mexican food. They make it fresh right in front of you. However my one complaint is that the chips are too thick. They do an excellent job with the nachos and load them up pretty good but the chips are really thick so if they fix the chips then it would be 5 stars. Also, it is inside a gas station which doesn't feel as clean as you'd like for a restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was great. All of the people working were happy to be there, and happy to be serving their customers. The owner(?) Ben, was incredibly nice and personable. Note that it is part of a gas station, so don't let the oddball location detour you.  I had the Jefe's Burrito. This thing is a delicious monster! It seemed a tad high on the price, however considering the size and how good it was, I don't feel it wasn't worth it to go. Also, the hot hotsauce was surprisingly spicy, unlike most Mexican food places you go these days.  I will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Amazingly good!  Burrito was gigantic and super high quality. Owner Ben super friendly and 100% committed to making sure customers are satisfied. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Their food is on point  Asasa fries are a must!! Not to mention great customer service ;)"}
{"text":"Came in five minutes before closing and they still let us order. The customer service here is amazing. The owner let us know everything the business means and offered us samples. Took the time out to shake my hand and got a free drink because it was my first time! So much better than Robertos (service and food quality). Will be back, forsure worth five stars."}
{"text":"So I decided to try this place since it is super close to my house. I went in and decided to order a chorizo breakfast burrito. Since I was a new customer I did receive a free drink which was cool. Looking at the only 2 menus that were in the entire little place, the owner of this restaraunt was talking across the counter to multiple people and didn't bother asking me if I needed help or even recommended anything.  Anyways, I decide what to get and he did tell me it was going to be 15 minutes due to online orders. That was fine with me. But never did I think it was going to be 30 minutes which is what I waited for one simple burrito. Mind you, he did try to accommodate me with an extra add on of sour cream for the wait. Since the kitchen is pretty visible, I watched anxiously for my burrito. Although I did see that the owner/chef was dripping in sweat, dripping down his nose. I kept a close eye on him due to the fact I didn't want his sweat in my burrito. Ew.  Since he offered me sour cream for the long wait, I expected sour cream, right? Nope nothing on the burrito. It was a big portion size but nothing had flavor. Rice was undercooked. Green sauce was okay but tasted like it was a little less watered down from Robertos. Paid $9 for this thing and definitely didn't meet any expectations, sadly. Ate half, threw the rest away."}
{"text":"First time at Jefe's tonight. Surf n turf burrito was great. The shrimp was BIG. Steak was delicious. The chicken street tacos were amazing. White meat chicken was very moist. My favorite was the carne asada nachos. The chips were delicious. They were busy, but Ben kept me entertained. Order ahead of you're in a hurry. My new favorite taco shop."}
{"text":"OMG, best street taco's, burrito, chips and salsa! Will be back.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but a bit pricey. Menu needs some work. I wanted tacos, next thing I know it was $15 for 6 tacos."}
{"text":"Don't judge the book by its cover. This has been said about Jefe's before I am sure. If what you care about is good mexican food, this is the place. If you are looking to have dinner out and sit down and spend some time, this is not the place. It's worth it to call ahead or order online because there can frequently be a 20 minute wait otherwise, which should tell you something. Order less than you think you want or you'll have tons of leftovers."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Vegas from a small town in central California where surprisingly, our food choices were diverse and superb. Since living here, we have experienced disappointment after disappointment as we frequent local eateries. Until now. Jefe's is legit!!  The street tacos are amazing. The burritos can't be beat! They are LOADED! The carne asada fries...well...you must try them!  We have yet to be anything but satisfied with our food selections from Jefe's. Order to go; no one wants to eat in the middle of a gas station. Better yet, download their app and have your order waiting for you, earning taco points to boot!  Trust me. You must try Jefe's today. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good job I don't like tacos too much but I really enjoyed the owner is awesome and the food is just outstanding mile and a half from my house"}
{"text":"Great food and service. This is my first review but the experience was good enough I felt compelled to do so."}
{"text":"Holy Moly. This place is the truth!  So delicious. The chimichanga was the size of a small cat! (But had shredded beef inside!). Green sauce was great as well."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy :) I have been looking for good Mexican food since I moved here and I believe I have found it! Everyone working there is so sweet and helpful, and very funny.  Right down the street from my work, and near my house also.  My coworkers and I love to stop in for lunch. Thank you guys so much!"}
{"text":"Great street tacos in a gas station.  Ben, the owner, is incredibly gracious and friendly.  I would gladly eat here again.  I had the carne asada, carnitas, al pastor, and chicken.  The carne asada was the weakest flavor-wise, but the other three were terrific.  Free drink with Yelp check-in.  I drove 10 miles each way to eat here and it was totally worth it.  Friendly staff, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Vegas is blessed with many good Mexican eateries. Some of the best are hole-in-the-wall Mom and Pop places. Even so, I was surprised when walking into Jefe's that it is basically a gas station counter with a few small tables.   But that is the only neutral thing that I can say about the experience.  Everything else was stellar!   ...and I mean really **really** good  The owner, Ben, is a among the rock star elite when it comes to customer service. You won't find a cooler or more positive guy anywhere. You are family the moment you start chatting.   The food is big, plentiful, and top-notch. The Best!"}
{"text":"Located in a gas station.  Food was good.  Priced a bit higher then other Mexican fast food chains."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today and it's the Mexican food I've been looking for! So delish! The staff was great and nice and order was perfect. I ordered and paid ahead of time online. Don't let the fact that it's in a gas station detour you!"}
{"text":"I MapQuest the location and was surprised to find it was in a gas station but don't let it scare you away. Yumm, I am so full. The food was really good. This might be a regular spot. I had the soft tacos, they had great flavor. The customer service was great. I ordered online which I like this feature."}
{"text":"mini al pastor tacos before we hit the road back to Chicago. Thank you Las Vegas, thank you Jefe's for these one-of-a-kind treats!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, the wait was a little long but he was very busy with graduation season and walk in business.  The behind the counter staff was amazing(thanks Nora).  Definitely will be back on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I was referred by two people and they were not wrong.  I got the Al pastor (pork tenderloin) nachos and the rolled tacos.  First the nachos were delicious.  The seasoning on the meat was excellent and there was plenty of meat on them.  They did not skimp!  Now the rolled tacos...for 6 they offered 3 &3.  That was awesome.  You don't have to get all of one kind.  My son had no complaints about them. I tried the rolled tacos and it wasn't just tortilla and a little bit of meat.  It was a filled to just the right amount.  So now the sauces.  The red sauce is not for wimps.  It is spicy, so if your a wimp with hot I would suggest the green sauce.  It was really good.    I have already referred a friend so I obviously thought it was delicious.  The price is a little higher than what you would pay for at Robertos but the quality of food is 100 times better.  And you can get refills on horchata!!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely incredible!..Had the chicken burrito and girlfriend had the chicken nachos. Wait was a little long but worth it. Employees nice as hell and I got a free drink!"}
{"text":"Walking out of Jefe's with a HUGE smile on my face because I met the most friendly people! I've never had someone genuinely care to know my name & about me at any fast food restaurant. Ben was super sweet & I couldn't have asked for better customer service! Not only do they have top notch people skills but the food is AMAZING. The carne asada fries I got were LOADED with meat. Definitely knocks Roberto's & Pepe's off the map. I will be returning many times! So happy to find this place!"}
{"text":"What a great find! We just ate here after looking for a taco place. We were not disappointed. Everything on the menu looks delicious, I wish we could have tried everything. All was fresh and portions are not lacking. Great customer service. Friendly, attentive and proud of what they serve you."}
{"text":"This place is located inside a gas station. It's not really a sit down place. There are only 2 small tables with a few chairs inside. I don't really see people eating here whenever I come in. Most people order for takeout. I have eaten here many times and this place never disappoints me. The food is amazing. My favorite is their burrito. I always get the al pastor burrito with chicken and it is mouth watering, finger licking delicious. Customer service here is also friendly even though the wait can be lengthy most of the time. It's best to order online ahead of time for pickup. Their limón water (sort of a light lemonade) is also delicious. Definitely recommend this place for any Mexican food lover."}
{"text":"El Jefe's is awesome. Priced higher than you'd expect but the food is delicious socal mex! Owner is super nice and always takes care of his customers."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Jefe's Taco Shop and you can bet that it is definitely not the last! ! We had the Carne Asad fries (which is larger and much tastier than his competition ), carne asada burrito,  chile relleno and Jefe burrito and all was by far better tasting than all the closest taco shops we've frequented!  The owner is great with customer service and makes sure that everything is all good!"}
{"text":"Came into this hole in the wall gas station only to find a an awesome mexican food restaurant. The food is authentic as is the owners. Excellent customer service. Big portions. Well worth the visit. Will return many more times."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food from a hands on owner. The mini tacos (pork and the beef ) were amazing and the guacamole was better than anywhere else i have tried . Chatted with the owner Ben and this is a guy who really cares about the food he produces. So now i dont have to go to San Diego for real Mexican food ."}
{"text":"Ben is what true customer service represents kind sincere and genuine. He take the time to talk to all people and then takes the orders sets expectations  and the food is never disappointing always worth the wait. Yes more often than not there will be a wait and its for a reason great service great food...."}
{"text":"Dont know if I have had better Mexican food for the price we paid. On par (if not better) than expensive Mexican restaurants around town and its at a gas station, which is more rare than finding a clean gas station restroom. You cannot go wrong here EXCELLENT!!"}
{"text":"Really really realllllll realllllll good food. And excellent service. They will accommodate any order. We wanted a bean rice and cheese chimichanga and boy did they do it! Great meal. Great service. I'll be back, sooner than later."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Mexican restaurant in town. We got the Carne Asada street tacos, with chips and guacamole... and man, the tacos were amazing... but those chips stole my heart! Not only that, but the amazing owner came out and made  our Cinco De Mayo dinner a little more special by making it candlelit. We will be back... frequently."}
{"text":"Located inside a gas station, Jefe's has two tiny tables in the back and a counter where you can order some seriously excellent food.  Manny told us it was all cooked San Diego style, which I'll have to take his word on because I haven't been to San Diego to eat yet.  Whatever the explanation is, I'm glad Jefe's is close to home so we can eat here often.  And this is from me, who isn't a big fan of Mexican food. Hubby IS a big fan, and he loves the place also.  In fact, I've never seen him devour refried beans like he did there and going into poetic rhapsody whenever he had to come up for air.  He had a couple of fried tacos and loved them. I had the 3 pork mini tacos and they were so overloaded with meat that I separated the two taco shells and halved the filling into each part so it became six tacos (which was good because Hubby also ate half of my tacos).  We've already been back twice and that's pretty rare for us, we like to always explore and try new stuff. However, sometimes a place is just too good not to return to, and Jefe's is one of those."}
{"text":"Awesome carne asada fries and best California burrito Ive ever had! Great service too! My whole family has liked everything we have gotten from here."}
{"text":"When I received an email talking about the 2016 Bizzie Awards, I had no idea such a thing existed.  When they mentioned the Jefe's Taco Shop (JTS) was a recipient of such an award, I  had no idea Jefe's existed.  After reading several of the reviews and eyeballing some of the photos, I knew I would have to pay JTS a visit.  BOOKMARKED.  Thank you yelp and fellow yelpers!  JTS is located inside a gas station on the corner of Tenaya & Sky Pointe.  It seemed an odd sort of business relationship after walking through the doors.  I scanned the surrounding prior to walking to make a purchase and observed the happenings.  Most arrangements like this serve some typed of process trash but Jefe's certainly did not appear to doing that.  The quarters are small and tight, but I would later find that the heart of JTS is wide open, kind, and tasty.  It was a Saturday night if memory serves.  My arrival was just sort of the dinner rush.  The nice lady at the register took my order which consisted of a cheese quesadilla and Jefe's burrito.  JTS also has a program where on your birthday, they will feed you for free.  I enrolled.  Hopefully, it does not fall on a Sunday or Monday because JTS would be closed.  I checked in on my handy and dandy yelp app and received a complimentary drink.  I chose a horchata to compliment my meal.  I was advised the horchata was at the tail of the current batches existence.  JTS makes it fresh and I was informed a new batch was forth coming.  I took what was left enjoying and sort of enjoyed a liquid version of the cinnamon challenge.  But it's not the horchata I want to write about.  It's the food and the very pleasant and personal experience.  Ben was working behind the counter and engaged me in witty banter.  Seems we are from the same neck of the woods in a San Diego County sort of sense.  Full of smiles and stories, I sat back and watched him engage every customer that came through, be they new or a regular.  When my meal arrived, I had secured a seat at one the small tables just in front of the counter.  The customers kept coming and decided to punch out.  Thought about just sitting on my truck bed but opted to just head home.  But not before exchanging pleasantries with the lady and Ben before I left.  I will forgo my review of the quesadilla.  Unless it's cold, there is no such thing as a bad one.  But on that note, if you want a regular cheese quesadilla, it's huge and you are presented with several cheese options.  I like cheddar.  Maybe it's not authentic, but it's how my Abuelita used to make it.  The Jefe burrito was 12,000 calories of pure surf, turf, and cluck joy!  Just north of ten bucks, it's shrimp, carne asada, and chicken awesomeness.  It comes with pico, guacamole, sour cream, and I added cheese.  These amazing ingredients were swaddled in what JTS describes as a 16\" real flour, \"San Diego\" tortilla.  And....get this....it's made with lard.  The way a damn tortilla should be made.  My eyes rolled back in my head like a great white shark with every bite.  Each bite was complimented with a dousing of JTS's wonderful red hot sauce.  Since my visit, I think of JTS everyday.  I could easily visit everyday.  The only reason I don't is because I don't want to weigh 400 lbs.  But trust you, me.......I will return...and I will bring others to share in the experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even nicer people. They talk to you like a friend not just a customer. I go way out of my way to come here and always enjoy the food"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! Great food! Great customer service! Great experience! I've told all my friends and coworkers about this place and now they're hooked as well! Great experience!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and flavorful! Portion sizes were large and very filling. The customer service was exceptional! The manager, Ben was awesome and even took his time to sit and talk with us. Don't let the gas station fool you! We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The chimichanga, although a huge portion, was lacking in flavor and didn't live up to the hype. And although I was told it would take 20 mins to fry, it was closer to 40 mins before it was ready. I've had positive experiences in the past and the burritos and tacos were pretty good.   But it's a further drive than some other places and not a convenient location.   On the positive side, they have online ordering!"}
{"text":"Ben, the owner, is very friendly. He will want to know your name and will make some small talk as well as let you know a little about the menu and his business. My husband and I ordered, after a bit of a wait standing at the register waiting. While we were waiting Ben addresses all the customers who had ordered ahead of us by name, even introducing us to them. The food was delicious and the portions were HUGE. We were treated to fountain drinks for free. The prices are great. I will be coming here again and am so glad I did not allow the divey gas station it is located inside of keep me from trying this gem. TRUST ME, TRY IT!!"}
{"text":"The best taco shop in Las Vegas, and probably all of the 50 states. I'll never go to another taco shop again. It does take a little bit of time to get your order, which is why I always plan ahead and order online, run an errand and then swing by to pick it up. It's so so worth the wait and the price!"}
{"text":"the food is amazing and the customer service is outstanding just so happened to be standing behind a guy when (I didn't get his name) the cashier told him today is your lucky day and proceeded to tell him it was taken care of. I don't typically see things like that so I was immediately taken back. He then goes to mention we treat our customers like family which is what I seen in a short amount of time. I've come here before and usually have great food and good customer service I definitely recommend this place to anybody and everybody and if you're hesitant don't be go in and get food"}
{"text":"Tonight my fiancé and I just wanted to try a new spot for tacos and ended up in heaven on earth. The customer service we received from Ben was awesome and the food was so good we were forgetting to breath while eating! We are now apart of the family and we will DEFINITELY back!!"}
{"text":"Take a moment to realize this place has 5 stars and serves Mexican food out of a gas station -   When my friend told me about this place I was skeptical. Drove here all the way from Summerlin on a Sunday to not have realized on Yelp that it was closed. Per the owner it'll be closing on Mondays as well very soon.  Let's begin with Ben himself because he's the reason this place is so liked. He's out of control in the best of ways & will make an impression on you. Charismatic is an understatement. If you don't like anything he'll take care of it, no questions asked. Talk about awesome customer service!   Now the food - we ordered small carne asada fries that could feed 4 and we also wanted to try some of the street tacos so we got chicken & al pastor. The chicken was moist but super spicy for my white girl problems. The al pastor was a little dry. The carne asada fries I will dream about anytime I'm hungry, out of control amazing! Loaded with pretty much everything it's heaven in your mouth! The meat was super tender and very flavorful.   Ben also gives all newbies complimentary drinks so he recommended we mix the limon & hibiscus and I loved the combo!   A reminder, this is in a gas station. It's not date night material for you cheap guys but perfect for every other occasion. We will be back to hang with Ben and get more carne asada!"}
{"text":"Chimichangas the size of a small dog! Worth a wait if there is one. Owner knows great customer service."}
{"text":"Amaaazing Mexican food! Thank you Yelp. We love coming here. Don't let the location fool you. Enjoy talking to owner too. Very personable. You can see he takes great pride in serving delicious quality Mexican food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow found this place on Yelp so we took a drive found not find a restaurant but there was a filling station, well saw a sign on the place for Mexican and said let's give it a try food was awesome service was good they will see us again for gas station Mexican"}
{"text":"First time here. Food was great and I'll definitely be back to try some variety. I do like how they are working on a healthier menu as well but will accommodate if you ask for a bowl or less oil, that type of thing. My biggest take away was the superb service. I've never experienced anything like it, especially from a taco shop in a gas station. The owner Ben knew every person that walked in there by name. You can tell he's a great sales person but not shady and genuinely cares about his customers. He has some interesting ideas and I know he'll do great things. Went in for 3 tacos and had a 2 hour conversation with the owner. It's almost like a networking spot. I'm usually not a very social person when meeting new people but this was a great experience and I'm referring everyone I know. Thanks again to Ben and his crew!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting this business. The only reason that I'm giving them four stars instead of five is because it was hard for me to find. It's inside of a gas station. They are very busy they take orders online which is extremely convenient. The food is extremely fresh and very tasty unlike Roberto's. Great customer service, huge orders and very good food large portions. If you order from here make sure you are hungry because you won't be when you're done very satisfying. The red sauce that I got with my tacos was actually hot spicy and I loved it.    Well yesterday evening I ordered from this business using the online app. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was. When I got there my food was ready except they waited until they saw my face to put my toppings on my tacos they didn't want my food to get cold. When I got home I really looked at my food and I could tell it was prepared with love. It looked very good very neat and tasted just as good as it looked. I am now hooked on this business I will become a regular. This is why I have to give this business five stars plus they call me by name when I walked in I like that.   Well I thought I would update my review. I have been a customer of this business I don't even know how long I stop checking in I probably have over 30 visits so I am convinced I made the right decision by choosing never to go to Roberto's again. The quality of their food is outstanding and it's the same cooks consistent also they prepare my food like they're cooking for their family. They all know me so anyone who doesn't want to go there don't like the food don't like the place feel free not to go because there's plenty of us that go there the business has a following I know I see it I'm part of it. One other thing Ben and my girls that work there they don't curse they are a family business. But I do so if you want a five dollar Burrito  in five minutes then take your ass to Roberto's and shut the hell up. Just saying"}
{"text":"Tasty great food for everyone's Mexican palette. They are totally customer oriented They don't take loyalty from customers for granted. It is a nice gesture to offer a drink while you wait for your meal.  Very friendly staff! Want you to be %100 satisfied. One idea: please consider a small sitdown place.  With some Mexican decor. Perhaps 10-15 tables. Order at counter and eat in."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Owners are always there making your food which is sooooo bomb! This place is like Roberto's on crack! Food quality is on point. My mouth is watering just thinking about this place lol."}
{"text":"Easily the best chimichanga I've ever had. I just moved to the area and saw the good yelp score for Jefe's so I decided to check it out. I got the carne asada in my chimichanga and on the nachos. Both plates were awesome! I'll definitely be back to try more stuff."}
{"text":"Recently, the owner accused me of being ratchet and that classy ladies don't get gas at night. (Las Vegas is a 24hr city.. is it classier to push my car at night into a gas station?)  Well, with that being said.. I came in to give them a try. Rolled up to the \"ratchet\" gas station that I've patroned for probably the last 13 years. Walk in, wow surprisingly this fine afternoon no one is using vulgar foul mouth language during business hours. (I surely was not aware that after hours means you are no longer a reflection of your business). Anywho, proceeded to look over the menu and ordered.   Food was ok, wasn't life changing. Seeing as how I frequent Baja it wasn't very comparable as I didn't see a spit for the Adobada. Oh well, thanks for lunch and letting me know I'm Ratchet.. how does one become a car tool?  I guess we'll never know!?"}
{"text":"Great little local taco shop. The al pastor nachos were bomb! Pleasantly surprised as it looks a little sketchy since it is in a gas station. Glad we took a gamble."}
{"text":"This taco shop is definitely a vegas gem. Located inside a Sinclair gas station in the north side. This is my first time here and I'll tell you what. Best customer service period.  Me and the owner Ben chopped it up about how he got started and shared some stories. Best of all he remebers our names. The tacos here are killer and in my opinion the best tacos in Vegas hands down. I've been to tons of taco shops and this has to be best by far. We live 20 miles away from here but I don't have a problem driving here for some real authentic Mexican food. Do your self a favor a try this place out"}
{"text":"First of all, holy crap, they are up front and personal with everyone in the best way. They put customer service first and I really respect the energy here. Everything feels so personal, 10/10 would 10 again.  Not to mention the food is pretty well done too. There's a lot of care put into this place. It feels like this is one of those starting out family restaurants.  I highly recommend it. I hope this place gets big."}
{"text":"Best burrito in Vegas hands down! Great quality food, and wonderful owners . All their food is top quality angus beef and high quality ingredients . Man, I just love this place . The food is enough to share. Birthday food, straight A food too! I really love this place, but the location is a little bizarre. Wish they would be out of the gas station, but it doesn't stop me!5 Stars!!!"}
{"text":"Jefe's is very delicious with very good quality ingredients.  It's a little bit pricy for Mexican food, but you do get what you pay for!  The ingredients are always fresh, portions are big, and food is yummy! I have talked to the owner and I think the manager, Manny. They are very down to earth and customer oriented.  They push customer service and it's very clear!  Everyone I have come in contact with is very pleasant and friendly.  I have been here numerous times and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thumb's up for Ben! Excellent Mexican food, free drink for first time customers."}
{"text":"Was skeptical with it being in a gas station bit was one of the best Mexican restaurant I have had in a while."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! We tried their California Burrito and Al Pastor Torta tonight and both were awesome and HUGE. Plus the employee I talked to was very nice and helpful. Great customer service goes a long way and we definitely took note. We will be coming back to try more!!"}
{"text":"THESE are the best authentic tacos I've had in Vegas, outside of Cindy Sue Street. Seriously. The wait is a few minutes but it is so worth it every time. Never had a bad thing from here. AND, they have amazing customer service. It's hard to find in most places in this town. IT is in the gas station, but don't let that fool you. You must go here, especially if you love street tacos...mmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"It is hard to find a place where the food has the authentic Mexican taste but in my opinion this is one of the few ones that is legit. It is an odd spot to have a food joint, when you look at the menu it does look like they over price their food but when you get it it is definitely worth it. The fill up their tacos, their salsas are bomb but spicy, portions are really good."}
{"text":"We were referred to this place by a friend. My husband is from SD and he has always complained about horrible taco shops in LV. These guys impressed my hubby and that is enough to be called \"awesome\" in my book. Try them, you won't be disappointed. We loved the food and their service so much that we had them cater our birthday party. They did not disappoint! Thank you Jefe's and Ben for your awesome service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from the moment I walked through the door. I did mention this was my first time here and asked for their recommendations. Everything is made fresh. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great tacos and great service. A business that values repeats is always one worth trying.  While I was in today for the first time,  I saw people that almost lived there.  The employees knew their birthdays, their kids birthdays, the due date of their cousins pregnancy. That should tell you something. Just try it. You'll be back, I know I will."}
{"text":"So hard to find good Mexican food in vegas. I am obsessed with this place! I came in for lunch this afternoon and ordered three mini tacos and chips and salsa. Sounds like a simple order, but it was so filling and it was honestly the best street taco I've had in vegas. Taste was incredible. The service was also outstanding. The cook, and the girl on register were so nice, it makes me want to come back everyday. I live just down the street so I just might Such a great vibe. Thanks again for an amazing lunch, ladies!"}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly service right off the bat, Ben makes you feel like a valued customer and friend.  Food is all reasonably priced as well.  I got the chorizo and egg combo platter, which came with an absurd amount of outstanding food for only $7.50, easily enough for two meals.  Plus, I got a free horchata for checking in on Yelp.  He'll give you free refills if you dine in, and if you're taking your food to go he'll top off your drink before you go.  I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"OK,    I Only Post ( 5 ) For Extraordinary.  Or ( 1 ) for  Unacceptable.  I've been to Mexico over 30 Times, I know good Mexican Food.  This is Great Mexican Food, Yes it's in A Gas Station, So what, I Get Gas and Milk in One Stop.!   Truly A must in the North West Vegas.!!!!  I'll Be BACK.!!!!    And the Owner is Amazingly COOL.!!!!    And it OK, there Not Open on SUNDAY, I mean it is The Sabbath Right...JUST SAY'n.?"}
{"text":"San Diego style Mexican food is the bomb! Who knew this taco shop in the gas station would be so awesome! Will come back often!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!! Great customer service, great food... I will definitely go back there. Can I give 30 stars instead of 5?! Because this place definitely deserve."}
{"text":"Update: 6/7/17: It's been a while since I've been here, longer since updating my review.  My staple here is the Carne Asada Street Tacos @$2.50ea, minimum 3ea order.  I ask for the rice and beans on the side.  Ben's dedication to keeping service personal and focus on customer name recognition has not wavered since my first visit.  I even overheard a customer on her 2nd visit here note that his \"charm\" is what won her over.  For me it puts the place above and beyond, but it's the food that inspires me to return and rave about this place over and over again.  It's a 15-20min drive back home from here, and I always order takeout, and Ben and Co have not forgotten to keep the cilantro and onions on the side to keep them crisp when I finally add them to my tacos at home.  Attention to those minute details after all this time is why their 5 Star rating remains over time with me!    Update: 4/4/16: I've been to Jefe's three times since my original review.  I've had the Tacos Al Pastor, which were good, but I still like 'em off the spit/rotisserie.  The Carne Asada Mini Tacos are my staple, and now Ben is using corn tortillas from San Diego, which have better stone ground corn taste as evident from their much more golden tone than their LV counterparts.  Last visit, I took home the red sauce and really wasn't feeling it, but probably because I'm such a salsa verde fan, and even expressed my preference for pollo con chili verde tamales above anything else.  Not everything has gone right when I visited, but Ben has always been up front, honest, and on point with what's going on in the kitchen, so I'll give a pass for those minute issues because of their commitment to customer service.   Ben has mentioned that their long range plan is to have a sit down location; we can all hope that happens in the very near future, and continue to support his efforts by patronizing this shop.  Lastly, all the prices INCLUDE TAX, so it's nice that you're dealing with round numbers and not having to scrap for change.  Original Post on 2/21/16: Living in Aliante and being a SoCal Native at heart, it's always a chore to have to drive out to Eastern, Bonanza, Charleston or Losee to get my street taco fix, so when I heard about Jefe's, had to check it out.  It's located inside the Sinclair Gas Station where Tenaya becomes Sky Pointe Drive.  Kept it simple, 3 Carne Asada Tacos to go with Salsa Verde on the side.  Ben the Owner was at the counter, took my name, my order and also gave me insight into their cooking and serving preferences.  Took his recommendation to pair it with rice and refried beans on the side, and a Horchata.  Since it was my first visit, the drink was free, and so were the rice and beans.  I asked him to keep the Salsa Verde and Onions/Cilantro on the side because I was taking the tacos to go, and didn't want them to get soggy on the 10 or so minute drive home, but really should have just taken them the way they prepare them to go, if different.  Bottom line: the tacos were great!  A good amount of meat, and they held up great from the drive (see before and after pics).  The beef was juicy and had some good back flavor to it.  The onions were fresh and had a kick without being overbearing, and a squeeze of lime blended  fine.  So fine in fact that I put the Horchata in the fridge and washed these flavorful tacos with a bottle of Stella instead.  Now the 5 Stars is for the Food and Service!  And I wasn't the anomaly either, as 3 other sets of customers got the same attention from Ben as well.  It's not really conducive for dine in meals, with only two tables and 8 chairs, but don't let that keep you from coming in and getting good food with great service!"}
{"text":"Good prices, good food. We ordered to go fish taco, mini carnitas taco and carne asada torta.  They were all good and flavorful, but the two complaints was that they forgot the sauce on fish taco and the ratio of meat to bread on the torta was off.  Good bread, but too much bread for the quantity of delicious carne asada. I still will definitely go back again and try some other things on menu. Another thing, Manny is a cool dude. He has customer service skills."}
{"text":"First time trying out this place. The customer service is great but the wait is very very long. The food is good but the price is a little pricey. I wanted to try ordering other things but the guy gave me a heads up that it would be 30 minutes wait or more, it was no joke it was a long wait. So if you're really craving for Jefe's then go ahead, if you're just hungry in a hurry this is not the place because the wait is long."}
{"text":"This was one of the best experiences with a restaurant I have had in a while.  Having previously managed for an unnamed burrito place for a couple years I am critical of both service and quality. Manny and Ben exceed in both. Listening to Ben and Manny talk to guests and taking time to explain was great and professionalism on that level is something you just don't see anymore. He did everything to resolve my payment issue and explained what he was doing each step of the way.   It was also great to meet and chat with Manny about the business, their vision, and living in Las Vegas (I am a transplant from WA).  My wife ordered about half the menu and it was all great. We will return."}
{"text":"This place is the best taco shop in town with even better customer service. Their sauces are not watered down and they use real guac."}
{"text":"Don't usually eat food from a gas station, had good reviews so tried it out. Great food and large portions  rice was also excellent, friendly service. Got a bonus while waiting for my food played video poker and walk out with $800"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Fresh ingredients. Definitely will go back. Only disappointment was we ordered 20 min ahead via the app, it said 15 min max, and when we arrived they hadn't even started it. It took 15 minutes and we were late to our movie. cashier did not show any remorse.... BUT. awesome tacos and this will be our new spot."}
{"text":"Came here due to the awesome reviews. It's a little taco shop inside a gas station, so we figured the service would be fast. Wrong. It took at least 30 mins. for our food to be ready. The quality was ok, at par with others in Vegas, but not amazing. Still, we decided to give it another shot and went today. We first tried calling in our order, hoping it would be faster. Sadly, we called 5 times and no answer. So the hubs goes to pick it up. He's prepared to wait about 20 mins or so based on our last experience. He waited 45 minutes for our food! Then when he got home, guess what? My tacos weren't in the bag. Good thing the burritos are huge and we could share, but that's not what I actually wanted or what I paid for. Didn't bother calling because we won't be going back. The food is not good enough for the 45 min we have to wait for it and then to come home and not even have everything we paid/"}
{"text":"Restaurant was located in a gas station. There were about 5 to 7 tables available to eat at. Food was good but not life changing and the customer service was top-notch. Giving about four stars because of its location."}
{"text":"These tacos are radical. Aside from delicious ingredients, they also do a very good job with using good portions with sour cream and guacamole, which is something that alot of taco places are a little hit and miss with. I recommend this taco shop to anyone looking for high quality tacos as well as the other items on their menus."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!! The Carnita Chimichanga was so crispy on the outside and delicious all the way through. The service was outstanding and Ben the owner was great. We enjoyed it so much we spent 2 hours talking to Ben after our meal. Thank you guys for a great meal with great company... We will be back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem but it's worth the drive. Super and amazing friendly staff, really got a chance to know us and explain their menu. Got a free drink with our meal and also guarantee free burrito for your birthday. And the star of the show is their tacos! Amazing flavor! They also gave us free rice and beans to try out which is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I was a bit skeptical on trying this place out bc it was located inside the gas station. I'm so glad I went, bc this place is SOO GOOD! It's a little whole in a wall place that serves a variety of Mexican food. Not only is the food really good, but the customer service is what stood out to me the most ! It was my first time trying Jefe's Tacos and let me tell you ... the people working there were so welcoming and easy to talk to! I'm definitely coming back for more.   There are only a couple of tables if you're planning on dining in, but they also accept online orders."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the mood for some Mexican food. We did not feel like eating at the usual under par Mexican places i.e. The don tor tacos at fab freds or Robertos. Sooooooo we found this hole in the wall Mexican place with 5 stars on Yelp !! So why not give it a try. He got the jefe's burrito and I got the Mega carne asada fries to share with my sister and my boyfriend. we also got a quesadilla with a mix of cheddar and Monterey Jack.   We met Ben and the story of his business and what quality of service and food he and his staff is providing. Also any student with straight As get a free burrito!!  Now back to the food lol the jefe has chicken, shrimp and steak neatly wrapped in a tortilla. I had a bite with some red sauce (had a nice kick) and then this green sauccce and he said he couldn't finish it because the size of this was the size of his arm but, because of how great it was he did lol, it was cooked very well and was well seasoned. Now my behemoth of a meal, the MEGA fries and the name does not do this justice, meat was not dry, is was tender, flavorful and juicy. Fries were crispy and cooked perfectly not soggy or greasy. All together was a match in heaven in my mouth. Quesadilla was filled with a very good amount probably 1/2 a pound of cheese lol (there's no such thing as too much cheese ).  We will most definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times it has been very good.  The food is all made fresh, the service is always friendly, the owner is a nice guy who likes to chat people up, and the portions are huge.  They have a large menu with a large variety of things for pretty much anyone, except tamales I believe.  Not the kind of thing you want to eat every day as it is salty as hell, greasy and fatty...but damn it is good when you eat it.  The quesadillas are HUGE, and they are delicious...and the same can be said for most everything else on the menu.  Tacos, mulitas, rolled tacos, burritos, etc, all eaten by me and all great.  The jefe's burrito (I think was the name) with shrimp and chicken and beef was fantastic...and could feed two.  Seriously.  If you look at the prices at first and think...this is kind of expensive for a gas station taco shop...you are wrong.  The food is good quality and fresh made and for what you pay against the amount you get, it is not expensive at all.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing service, polite and very customer oriented. I was blown away at how I was taken care of from the moment I walked up to the counter. Be patient, they get busy with online and phone orders but they will tell you this upfront. Ben (the owner) has great character and will make sure your time and money are well spent. The California burrito Al pastor was delicious. I cant wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The owner is very personable and the food is delicious! It's a pleasure for me to write a review about this establishment. Wish it was one located in Chicago for us to enjoy. We will definitely visit here everytime we are in Vegas. Quality food and reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Tacos are good, friendly staff. but wait time is long and food items are not always available."}
{"text":"This little shop is inside the Sinclair station near Tenaya and Ann. The owner, Ben, was very nice and personable. The prices were good and the food was delicious! Hopefully he will build more of these around town!"}
{"text":"This place seriously has some AMAZING food!! Always great customer service and hands down some of the best tacos and Mexican food I've had in forever!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.   I'm a white dude from a Mexican area. I've eaten some of the best mexican food in the world in orange county and San diego. This place is just as good or better.  Their pastor is cut from pork tenderloin. Absolutely phenomenal. Carne Asada fries are huge!!! Super tasty!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Absolutely amazing customer service!!! Food is great, portions are generous! We will be back for sure!!!  And like Ben said, they speak English!!! He also says the food is better than sex! You will come 3 times, breakfast, lunch and dinner!!!  So many good things to say about this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Went to Roberto's down the street at the AM/PM. Line was too long, prices were higher, and customer service was not that great. Ended up back at my old spot Jefe's Taco Shop. Owner greeted us with a smile. Gave my nephew a free burrito for having A's on his report card. Great place."}
{"text":"Great little place to eat. I found them on Yelp and decided to give them a try. I was so amazed by the service and the food that I went back later in the day to try something else on the menu. I met the owner that evening and he explained that they were all from SoCal and the history of the food prep. It definitely tastes like something you would get from a mom and pop shop in San Diego. I highly recommend this place. My favorite part of the two dishes I've tried so far is the rice, it was definitely made with love."}
{"text":"The wait is what you would expect from a sit down restaurant (they do have seating, but it is in a gas station), so it takes a little time, but it is worth it. Probably best to order and then go pick up and take it home. Price is decent."}
{"text":"I only made a small order, but it was good. Red hot sauce is yummy, try it! Owner dude was really nice, too. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a taco shop just because I was tired of eating Roberto's. My first visit was great. Everyone was friendly and the owner, Ben was great with the customer service. He gave us his background and kinda found out who we were at the same time. He broke down the menu, got out orders and gave us free drinks since it was our first visit. The food was great! I stopped eating beef and pork so I tried the pollo asado fries. They were a different from the taste I was used to of course but they were still good. I put red sauce on my fries and the sauce was perfect. The horchata I had was also great! It didn't have too much cinnamon like some places and I prefer it like that. All in all, great experience, good food and good people I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow.  Very rude, dark complected gentleman behind the counter using foul language while customers, including myself were inside..  Judging by the other reviews, this isn't the first time.  If this guy could care less about the customers, I'm sure he cares less about the cleanliness BEHIND the counter..  Jefe, blow me."}
{"text":"This place was so incredible! Bought a huge $100+ meal for the guys at work. Food was TASTE, manager was a nice dude, and so were the other workers.   We got mini tacos, MASSIVE burritos, chips, a quesadilla, and horchatas.   I had the Jefe's Burrito and it was very good. The tortilla was so soft and beautiful, the meats were cooked and seasoned greatly, and the guac was creamy and tasty. I really liked it.   The chips were crunchy and super good! They are thick, but salty and more hearty than super thin chips.  The green and red sauce were both so good at what they do - green for mild, red for hot. I mixed em a couple times for the kick + taste.   The horchata was super good: not too watery but not too syrupy to where it feels like you're drinking melted sugar haha.   It's in a gas station, which, was a gas station in terms of cleanliness. But I'm not picky so I don't care about that. They asked if I wanted likes and I watched the guy wash the lines and rinse his knife before cutting them for me. Then he came over and chatted with me just a bit and welcomed me, even though I'm white and he was Hispanic, there was no racism or difference between either of us! We both brothers! So that was cool.   I ordered all the food online and didn't experience any issues in the process. It has a lot of customization options on there too which is sweet (extra meat / toppings etc).   Would DEFINITELY go again.. it's that great Mexican food vibe that works for school kids, but one of my favorites in that category for sure. Thanks Jefe's!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a gem in the rough.   Great mexican food, great prices.  Friendly staff.  I've told several friends and they've become instant converts.  Best place in town to get a two fisted burrito.  Only minus is the distance from my house."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for a while now best mexican food in this side of town, never go wrong with their burritos or anything else on their menu I always get something different if u are ever around the area make sure u stop in and grab a bite to eat"}
{"text":"It's literally in a gas station... And it's sooo good! The carne fries are huge! They have two sizes, the super size (small which is still huge) and mega (I think but that's even bigger!) We also got a shrimp burrito for obvious reasons (it has shrimp, duh.) The shrimp burrito was about as long as my forearm and too big for me to even grab with my hands.. That's a burrito right there. It was the BEST shrimp burrito I've ever had in my entire life. Coming from San Diego to a city that doesn't have too many good Mexican shops was the best choice the owner could ever make. They proved are a few bucks more than usual but the flavors and portioning sizes make up for it. It's worth it!!! And their service ugh. Everyone there was so cool and nice. The owner is the most honest man I've ever met. Their customer service is so impressive. I really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've got about 10 reasons why you should go to Jefe's. Not just because the food is AMAZING! Mostly because the owners personality is just as AMAZING! I live 30 miles away from this place and I take the drive across town to enjoy my two favorite burritos: 3 piggies breakfast burrito & the Jefe's burrito. Every time I'm leaving vegas on a road trip we make sure to grab our favorites before hitting the road. Every experience that I've had at Jefe's has been more then pleasing. If you love good people feed this business! If you love amazing burritos feed this business!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly staff, and amazing food that deserves to be mentioned twice. It came highly recommended from a friend who said not to be daunted by the fact that it's in a gas station, and they were absolutely right. The pollo asado is fantastic, I highly recommend trying it in the California burrito. The Jefe's burrito is amazing, too."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I don't think I have ever been welcomed to a restaurant like that before. Ben was really nice, layed back, but prompt about getting my order out. He genuinely wanted to get to know me and I believe every owner should show face like that and see who comes to their business. The location throws you off because the taco shop is inside the gas station. But looking beyond that, it's a gem. Roberto's is two minutes away from where I live, from now on I will make the 20 minute drive when I'm in the mood for some Mexican food. Overall it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! It's in the gas station store. Not only did they have fantastic customer service (thanks Ben!!), but the tacos were authentic street tacos! Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Exceeds all expectations. The owner takes such pride in his food and his brand. No other restaurant treats customers as well as Jefe's does!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, Ben was great! All I can say is we will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"There are a lot of good food places in Las Vegas, it's just a little bit harder to find them in the North side! It's located inside a gas station, but area seems to look just fine in my opinion! I may say a lot of people are nice in my reviews, but really, the owner is welcoming to his customers and if there are any adjustments that needs to be made he is more than willing to fix it or make up for it somehow. The price here is also great! I have only tried the tacos, but they're all really good with the sauce! You have to get the hot sauce! :)"}
{"text":"Best tacos in the Northwest. Love the carnitas here it's perfectly cooked. Salsas are really good. Owners are great people and have excellent service."}
{"text":"Jefe's is THE place I tell everyone about.  The food is always on point and the service is fantastic. Al Pastor fries are always a favorite at my house. Their 50/50 drink is a must! When I see cabeza or lengua on the menu I know the place is legit. And Jefe's is not only legit, they're beyond delicious. Do yourself a favor, go, eat, and return."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for a gas station Mexican food, they have an online app on their website which you can order from and get delivery too. But the owner of this place is like a car salesman and will talk your ear off, which I didn't like. The service is slow too, tbh, ordered the food and was still waiting when I went there to get it, so you'll be just standing in the gas station awkwardly with the owner talking and blah blah."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat.  Its better than the rest.  The customer service is the best and its a very personal experience from the first time you walk in.  All the food is top notch quality.  The monster California Burrito is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"OK. I wanted to make sure I tried several of the menu items before giving a review. This place has 5 stars so there is some pressure to make sure that the review is accurate. I don't want to do something knee jerk and ruin their rating. I've been here 4 times now. Each time I have gone with different family members or friends. I've got to say that everything I've had here has been excellent. Everybody else I've taken has really enjoyed the food as well. We've tried probably 80% of the menu and everything is extremely good. Customer service is excellent. They have special Systems set up to remember your past orders. That's really nice. The owner/manager Ben also remembers your name. Also a very nice touch.   The only downsides are 1) it is in a gas station tucked away behind Ann road 2) seating is very limited, and 3) since they are getting more popular and busy sometimes you have to wait a while to get the food.  But now that I think about it the down sides are just more excuse for it being unique and eclectic. Kind of like Tommy's burgers in LA. In short they deserve the 5 stars that they have so far. Take the trip, try to find them and enjoy a great Mexican meal."}
{"text":"These tacos are amazeballs I've been searching for a taco place that satisfies all of my taco needs(taste, location, price) & I think I found it I thought there were no decent taco places in the nw & the chain one just don't cut it for me but I found this place here on yelp, & the reviews sold me, I wish I would've known about it sooner I can't wait to try the rest of the menu which sounds delicious"}
{"text":"First time here and I had a Really good Carne Asada burrito! Fresh and tasty. I'll be back to try other items. Great customer service. I like giving a family owned business a chance and I hope they succeed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best burrito I've had in years! I went in and had the Carne Asada burrito. Cooked & flavored right, tasted wonderful and was it bigger than a small dog. Red and green salsa is awesome! This place smokes Roberto's! I'll be going here from now on."}
{"text":"1st time here, Came inside and got greeted by who seemed like the owner or manager. Who is really joyful/friendly. Amazing customer service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Always the best customer service. The food is always amazing and they have the best shredded beef taco in town! Plus it's even easier to order on the app and just run in and pick it up, I love it!"}
{"text":"First time trying Jefe's. I must say that this is the Best Burrito I had so far! I had the Jefe's Special and it's Perfect in my book. Not greasy at all ! My daughter who is a food critic gave it a 9.5 which I think is Very Good! The ladies in the front are Very Nice! I liked when they acknowledge my presence and Smiled. The only thing, I didn't get to meet Ben. This is a must try place! Keep up the good quality!"}
{"text":"First time here and I'll definitely be back.  Great SoCal Mexican!  Authentic, fresh ingredients, no chemical additives or fake oils. Owner is friendly and gracious and knows how to treat his customers, made sure I had plenty of salsa and napkins, even took my food to my car for me.  Food is great, very reasonably priced.  $50 to feed family of 10.  Very clean.  I love the basic realness of my whole experience there. Jefe's burrito, pollo asada fries, carne asada nachos, carnitas street tacos, rice, beans all seasoned to perfection.  Family devoured all and wanted more!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and awesome service! Definitely a hidden gem! Will definitely  be going back. The owner is super friendly and is out too ensure quality customer service A++"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best taco shop in Las Vegas! We lived in San Diego for four years and got used to amazing taco shops on every corner, so coming back to Vegas where all the taco shops are garbage sucked. We had pretty much given up on taco shops until we came here! We knew we were in for something really good or really bad when we saw it was inside the gas station but the second we walked in, it smelled like home. The guy at the register was super nice, and let us know up front it would take awhile since they had a lot ahead of us (you can order online which is magical, we will definitely do that next time). We probably waited about 30 minutes at 7pm on a Friday, which was fine. The second we took our first bite, we knew it was worth every second of the wait. The food is made fresh, and with quality ingredients. Everything was cooked to perfection! We had a carne asada burrito, a pollo asado burrito, and beef rolled tacos. Seriously the best burritos we've had in Vegas. We felt like we were right back home in San Diego!! Highly recommend and we cannot wait to come back!!   Tips - order online first, and have some patience. The food takes time because they're cooking everything fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and welcoming Taco Shop. Love the Asada Fries! To be honest, never had anything that wasn't good."}
{"text":"I have to say this was a truly authentic Mexican restaurant, and it is located in a gas station. I would highly recommend this place to all my friends and to anyone reading this post. I want to thank Susan Bush for recommending this awesome establishment."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path and inside a gas station, but well worth the drive!  A friend recommended this place for street tacos, my husbands favorite.  Wow, the flavors were amazing.  It was super busy with lots of return customers eating away.  The guy was super friendly, and made sure we were happy with our food.  He even came out to meet and and greet us.  If you want a restaurant, being waited on type of place, don't go..but if you want awesome and authentic Mexican food, with fabulous flavors-go!  My husband wanted to go back for dinner after having lunch earlier!"}
{"text":"Wow. The service here is incredible! This is by far my favorite taco spot! I will be coming back for sure and telling all my friends about this place. Sure, I was skeptical because it's inside a gas station, but this place is a jewel! We went on cinco de mayo and although they were crazy busy, he treated us very well! The food is just as amazing as the service!"}
{"text":"My 2 daughters and I ate here this morning, was really looking forward to a breakfast burrito. I ordered the chorizo burrito and my other daughter ordered the carne Asada burrito. Chorizo was AMAZING with their green sauce, so good!!!!!  The carne asada was terrible, no flavor at all. I'm definitely going back to this place but not going to get the carne asada burrito again."}
{"text":"Best gas station Mexican food I've ever had.  Seriously though, this is surprisingly high quality food, fresh ingredients. San Diego style Mexican.  My favorites are the carne asada nachos, fantastic.  Burritos are also really good.  The only downside is the portions are so ridiculously huge, I wish they sold half portions."}
{"text":"The California burrito is awesome. This place is probably the best taco shop I've been to in town. Dig in."}
{"text":"Great customer service and the food is delicious! Don't be discouraged that it's in a gas station, definitely not what you expect."}
{"text":"Ben went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.  I loved the first half of my California burrito, and I'm looking forward to enjoying the other half later. My husband said it's the best enchilada sauce he's ever had.  I expect this will be our go-to place for Mexican food from now on."}
{"text":"The customer service here really sets the bar. That, combined with the delicious food makes this hidden gem a recipe for success. I will definitely make this my go-to spot."}
{"text":"My go to for a Mexican fix! This place is way better than Roberto's. Always great service super nice owner Ben & his employees are friendly. I always get Al pastor nachos kuz they are so damn good. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Always always order online! So glad we discovered this place. Hidden gem in a gas station."}
{"text":"When my wife and I were trying to find a place with good mexican food the internet guided us here. We had just moved here from seattle where decent taco shops were scarce.  When We got to the counter she asked if we had been here before, to which we replied no. She warned us this food is addicting... AND IT IS.  For food coming out of a has station this place is PHENOMENAL! We've had carne asada fries, California burrito, chorizo burrito, jefe burrito and their rolled tacos and it is all consistently delicious. The portions are very generous even for a guy my size (280 lbs of twisted steel and sex appeal) I got full, like stuffed off a burrito and some fries. If your from San Diego or miss that type of mouth heaven, this is where you need to come!"}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Mexican food, as my most recent lab tests can attest to :-) Sometimes life gets in the way, you get busy and don't stay in touch like you would like. I hadn't seen Paul W. in quite some time so, no matter where we dined, it was going to be a pleasant evening. My Yelp mentor is a regular at this place, so when he recommended it I was all in.  Jefe's isn't going to win any awards for location or atmosphere, but don't let that fool you. The food was outstanding. Mexican food at a gas station? What??? You betcha! There is a small dining area if you want to dine in, which is what I recommend.   I got Carne Asada chips, which quite possibly could've been the best ones I've ever had in the Vegas area. Ben definitely didn't skimp when he put these together. I can't comment on the price as I never looked at the menu and Paul W. picked up the tab. I also got a side of refried beans which, just like the Carne Asada chips, were outstanding. PW devoured a California burrito, which could've been the biggest burrito I've ever seen.   I will definitely be back and try to make my way through the menu at Jefe's. If you are in the mood for good Mexican food, it's well worth the drive from anywhere in the Vegas area to the 95 and Ann Road."}
{"text":"Its easy to see why this place has five stars, besides the food being really delicious, the customer service was great. Manny was really nice and friendly. He is really going places!! Thanks for the great food, and experience."}
{"text":"When I first started going here I thought it was great. It was excellent quality and my food was always awesome. Lately every time I go and order everything is just Meh (super average/basic) The meat quality is on the same level as Robertos and it lacks flavor. The new corn tortillas are dry and pretty much disgusting. The last time I ordered the carnitas the meat was dry and pretty gross. Personally I don't like thr Al Pastor or thr chicken here but that's just my opinion and the shrimp doesn't taste fresh. The prices keep going up yet the quality is going down. The breakfast burrtito was flavorless and really needed salt. The rolled tacos are still amazing. Now on to the customer service. The owner is quite frankly rude. At first his over talkative ways were funny but he talks ENTIRELY to much. He's rude and disrespectful to other businesses. He makes rude comments and his jokes are borderline racist. He doesn't know how to run a business. He makes you not want to go in and wait because you know it's going to take FOREVER and you have to listen to him tell the same tired ass jokes and bash the same places over and over again. Sigh....get new material please. 6 months ago this would've been a 5 star review. Now I'm only giving 2 because there's still a few redeeming qualities"}
{"text":"Yelp did not disappoint me with this one! I've had their California burrito and asada fries, both were amazing. My boyfriend and I have been hooked since the first time we tried it. The meat tastes better than other similar restaurants, the quality seems better as well, I don't have to pick out pieces of meat like I do with Roberto's (haven't been back to Roberto's since trying Jefe's). Staff is always friendly and professional. I'll be eating here quite often, definitely one of my faves."}
{"text":"Good mexican food seems to be a challenge to find here in Las Vegas. I recently moved in to the neighborhood and saw all the good reviews for Jefe's so the wife and I tried it out. When I arrived I was a bit surprised (shows how well I read things on Yelp) that they were in a gas station and while I was a bit taken back by that I do remember some of the best food I've had in cities like Austin come from the backs of random gas stations.  My wife ordered a couple tacos and I ordered the Jefe burrito. All I can say is WOW, this is probably the greatest thing I have ever put in my mouth.  Food was delicious and the service was friendly. Definitely a place you do take out from unless you want to sit in a gas station and eat but they also have convenient online ordering. I will definately return to Jefe's."}
{"text":"Decided to visit this taco shop today & boy is it yummy...I ordered the carne asada...it's loaded worth meat,  pico, guac, beans, fries... The portions are huge... I'm seriously struggling to finish my meal. .. Great customer service. .. Met the owner & talked to him while food was being prepared...will def add this one on my list."}
{"text":"I have been on the hunt for a good taco shop since I moved to Vegas, I moved here from Diego where taco shops are everywhere!!!! I found this spot on Yelp and decided to give it a try. The owner was so friendly, knew his regulars by name and the food.... Is sooooo good!!! The burritos are huge and so filling, the carne Asada fries looked amazing too, and the tacos.. Sooo good!!!!   This will definitely be my new go to spot!"}
{"text":"Don't let the gas station location scare you.  This place is first bite \"oh mah gawd\" GOOD! Everything on the menu is good. Once you have Jefes you'll never go back to Robertos!  My favorite is the AL Pastor Mulita and the Nachos. HANDS DOWN THE best spot in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"this is my new favourite spot for mexican food in vegas now, hands down. a friend and i came in after they closed and i told ben that it was my first time there and i was treated like they had known me for years! great quality mexican food for just a few more dollars than robertos. i got the carne asada tacos with a side of beans and rice and have been dreaming about them ever since. can't wait to come back here. also, if you get the chance try a drink combination called \"50/50\"! delicious all together with great service!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times now. The wait was very excessive when I first started coming. The wait time has dropped a lot! You can sense the owner's love and sense of pride for his business which I respect greatly."}
{"text":"Jefe's Taco Shop is located inside a gas station (currently Stop N Go) and usually has a long line of hungry customers waiting. On my first visit the guy behind the counter asked if it was my first time and when I said yes he introduced himself as an owner, Ben, and gave me a sample of their drinks (horchata, jamaica and limon) which were all good. He then gave me a menu to look over and said to just ask if I had any questions. When I was ready to order, Ben asked for my first and last name so that he could put it in his computer because you get a free meal on your birthday. I knew something seemed off about this because he only asked for my name and not my birthday or phone number. While the idea of offering a free meal to a customers is a nice touch, I can only figure there will be several customers with common names making this confusing. When I went back for a second visit the girl who took my order had to scroll through names to find mine taking longer than it really should for that type of thing. Nice perk that could use some tweaking.   #11 Crispy Rolled Tacos ($8) - You can choose chicken or shredded beef and it comes with cheese and your choice of either sour cream or guacamole and comes with a side of rice and beans. I went with shredded beef and asked for guacamole and sour cream, Ben was nice enough to say he'd not charge me for the sour cream this time. The sour cream personally had an odd taste to me, so I scraped off what I could, but the guacamole was pretty good and I saw them making a big batch of it fresh. There was a good amount of cheese on top and the rolled tacos weren't greasy and tasted great. The rice was average tasting to me however the beans with cheese were really good, so I'd ask for double beans next time. Priced right, tasted good and was filling!   Bean and Cheese Burrito ($4) - Since the beans with the combo meal I had were good it didn't surprise me to like this burrito. It was was bigger than the picture I posted makes it appear and they didn't skimp on beans or cheese. I'd order this again for sure.   Mini Tacos T.J. Style ($6 for 3) - You can chose from chicken, carnitas, asada and al pastor. Ben mentioned the price for this had changed however wasn't updated on the menus yet, so the price might have since changed, but Ben honored the $6 since that's what the menu said and I appreciated that. Just to note... The price is a bit more for lengua. I asked for one each of the chicken, asada and al pastor. The tacos were dressed with cilantro and onion with salsa on the side to add as you prefer. The asada lacked flavor to me however my hubby did have an asada burrito a couple weeks later and when I tried a bite it had good flavor, so maybe I had it on an off day the first time. The chicken was really good and the al pastor had okay flavor once I picked out some of the crispy black bits from the meat. Also I asked for flour tortillas and was told that I could only have corn tortillas for the tacos because the flour ones were for burritos. The corn tortillas came from a bag and as you can see from the pictures I posted they are dry. No bueno.   Mulitas ($6) - You can choose the meat you want, I went with carnitas. This wasn't a mula I am used to, it was really big (worth the money for the amount of meat and cheese) and also really greasy. While they certainly didn't skimp with the meat and cheese, the whole thing was just too greasy for me.   You can place your order online, but on my second visit the line was really insane and the wait was far too long. Yes they make your order fresh however they had a lot of mix-ups that night that was causing the delay. There was a customer who ordered online and they were apparently out of chicken for the tacos she ordered and instead of contacting her to see if she wanted something else they waited for her to show up to ask her about it. The customer ended up placing a whole new order and then someone else that placed an order inside said there food wasn't right when the lady behind the counter opened the food to show them and it had to be remade causing even more of a delay for us waiting customers. On the second visit I waited about 40 minutes and let me tell you seating is limited in the gas station and it gets cramped. There is a few tables/chairs, but as I mentioned it's cramped, so eating inside will just be up to your preference.  This place is highly rated on Yelp. When I redeemed the check in offer for a free drink the owner accepted it with no problem. He then asked if I was going to write a review and gave me his opinion on Yelp and even called some of the reviewers out by name. I was sorta shocked. He wants customers to talk to him about any issues before posting a review. Well, I appreciate him wanting to communicate with customers and make things right, but we still have to write about our honest experience and what happens even if corrected by the owner or not."}
{"text":"This place is by far the BEST Mexican food ever!! My husband and I eat here 2-3 times a month!! Ben is the owner and is an absolute sweetheart!! Always treats you like a #1 customer, polite, friendly, makes sure your happy or he isn't happy.  We've tried the tacos, burritos, and nachos!! The meat is so flavorful and tender, the green salsa is our favorite!! Just the perfect amount of kick! I highly recommend going here!!! Staff is kind and ordering online is the only way to get your accurate order!! Your food is ALWAYS shown to you before you walk out the door."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food. Best quick service mexican food hands down in an area oversatuarated with robertos, zabbas, and chipotles. Huge portions of good quality food. Only downside is that since it's fresh, does take some time, i would suggest ordering online."}
{"text":"Came back to give Jefe's another shot.  Customer service is still great, but the quality of the food is not good when you take it to go.   I understand it's due to the lard they use to cook. but it just doesn't hold up well. I got the California burrito, asada fries and two tacos.  I did see the owner getting very upset with everybody that rated them one star and I hope he doesn't freak out on me and just take this as something to work on. This place could be great but came up short."}
{"text":"Well I happened to stumble a pond this place after seeing some wonderful views here on yelp,and i must admit I was very impressed,I had a wonderful convo with the cashier who was very kind,i had the 3 mini carnita tacos just to try and my stupid self got the food to go so when I got home I ate the tacos,and I  honestly can say they we're the best carnita tacos I've had in vegas,I wish I would've got more food..lol"}
{"text":"Hubs and I were hungry for Mexican food and Yelp highly recommend this place.   The owner, Ben, welcomed us and told us more about the place and the food. He's super nice. They also have online ordering too which we will definitely have to try. Because we were first time customers, he gave us free drinks. Nice! We had a mix of Jamaica and limon that he recommended. It was awesome.   I ordered 2 chicken tacos and the hubs had an enchilada and beef taco. Our orders came with rice. After reading so many positive reviews, I was hopeful about how the food would taste. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint! The flavors were great! My crispy taco's chicken was juicy and tender and the side of rice had a nice great taste. Seasoned just right. You can smell the delicious aromas when you walk in the place and when I opened my takeout box at home, the aroma escaping brought me back to my grandma's house. The hubs really loved his too. He really liked the flavor of the enchilada sauce. And the red hot sauce Ben gave us was the best!  We will definitely be returning here from now on. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the menu!  Great job Ben! This is great tasting flavorful SD Mexican food done right!"}
{"text":"Great taco shop (aka gas station taco place)! Authentic Southern California Mexican food and excellent customer service. Great people working there that care about me as a customer and I like that. Some additional pros I like is they deliver and have an app. Free birthday burrito/meal is a cool Feature. Some cons are inconvenient location and kinda pricey, however the taste, quantity and customer service negate those cons leaving me to do nothing but give them a five star rating!"}
{"text":"Has become our favorite Mexican restaurant!!! I've wanted to write a review the last three times we've gone, but I start eating their food and completely get lost in the food. Recommend ordering online and picking it up cause they are often super busy. I've had the chimichanga with shredded beef, monster taco, fried taco, and asada fries. Everything was exceptional quality and huge portions. Customer service is top notch and I'm impressed how the owner remembers his customers so well. This is now a regular place for us to eat. Looking forward to our next trip here. YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"The people, the food, the everything is amazing!! My boyfriend and I will be back always. A small hidden gem, worth going out of the way for. So much food, for amazing prices. The staff is super friendly and a free gift on your birthday  So I got home and went to eat my tacos... I don't eat much especially since I'm trying to lose weight, but... ya know tacos. The mini tacos Ben, the fantastic owner, suggested were PERFECT for me. The minimum order is three and you can mix and match (I did chicken, AL pastor, and Carne asada,  so damn good) and they're perfect I got the rice and beans. The beans don't look like much but holy heck they were good and we'll seasoned. I'm for sure happy with them. Not overly greasy like Roberto's or Don Tortaco. Super fresh. (So people who complain they are closed Sunday and Monday thays because the ingredients are hand chosen and fresh) I'm not displeased at all. The green sauce is the perfect amount of spicy the red is definitely for the more adventurous spicy lovers, but my boyfriend loves it. All 5s from the 2 of us"}
{"text":"Absolutely great food quality every single time we eat here.  Very much like our southern California Mexican we grew up on."}
{"text":"Updated:   Well Ben if you can appreciate completely honest feedback here you go...   You talk way too much and don't listen enough.   We tried to tell you the last time we were there that we noticed a difference in your product. You just talked over us and changed the subject, so we left.   That's why I left the review.  ..........  We have been going here for awhile now, the food was always fantastic and the customer service was great. We liked it so much we stopped going to Roberto's all together.   Unfortunately the last two times we have gone the food seems to have gone down hill. They seem to be using different flour tortillas, the meat seems to be lower quality and the portions have become smaller.   The customer service is still good for the most part but unfortunately the food seems to be slipping.   We have started going back to Roberto's."}
{"text":"We ordered the Carne Asada tacos and the Camarones a la Diabla and both were amazing. The camarones came with an extreme heat warning to which I thought \"I can handle spicy food\". Let me be clear, while it was extremely good, it definitely warranted the warnings. I was sweating and I think I drank about a gallon of water before I was finished eating.  They didn't skimp on the shrimp either. I wouldn't be surprised if there was at least a 1/2 pound which made it an amazing value! We will definitely be back to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!! They are hidden so you wouldn't notice it off the street. They make homemade chips and their fajitas are so awesome I'm actually thinking of using them to cater my wedding. Highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Had been wanting to come here drove the 20 minutes just to find that they were closed on this Saturday.   DO NOT depend on them to keep regular hours or be open when they say they will be!"}
{"text":"I tried the monster tacos and they are huge and delicious!  The rice and beans are awesome, as well!  Always great personable customer service.  It's inside a gas station, but don't let that fool you :)"}
{"text":"The food is good; portion smaller than i am use to and the \"Boss\" is real chatty; in a cute way \"LOL\". I will surely return for seconds the next time i am in the area. Check out the map location because it's in a gas station with slot machines and other products on the corner of Skypointe & Tenaya.  :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. The employees are so friendly and kind. I love their rice and beans..it is awesome. I get their mini tacos. I get 3 and have 3 diff meats on each. The food is fresh every single time! I just hate that its in the gas station."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best. Best service. Best food. Best quality. Clean and cleaner. Definitely not what you would expect in a gas station. But you NEED TO TRY this place. Talk with Ben. He's fantastic."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried at this place is good.  The burritos are on point. They are well filled, nothing like the disappointing burritos at other places. The owner told my husband they work carefully to make sure you don't have extra dry tortilla in your burrito. Thinking about even that extra tortilla end is only one example of this place's care for their product and customers. We have had all except the vegetarian and the cabeza/lengua. - The A la diabla was a little hot for my husband.  I haven't had breakfast here yet because I'm not exactly a morning kind of girl but I have eaten about half of the rest of the menu. So here goes...The tamale sauce is great! The asada fries are on point, I have had all the soft tacos besides cabeza and lengua and they are awesome. The pollo asada changa is yum, I love the horchata, the mulitas are good as well.   The service is awesome. These guys want to go the distance, and deserve to! Order ahead and know the hours. :) It's in a gas station so we order to go."}
{"text":"? I can't remember the last time I had such good crunchy tacos. The salsa verde is amazing and the guacamole is perfect. I was also very impressed with their customer service! All of this and an app to preorder my food. What more could you ask for!?"}
{"text":"First visit here. Ben took the time to explain everything and chat with us while we waited for our fresh cooked food. We ordered a few different items and loved them all. We will definitely be back, very soon I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, and Carne  Asada fries  plan on to go for sure no seating. Worth the time for take out"}
{"text":"Tastey  tacos! Everything was fresh & looked great too!  Thanks Ben ! We even got a candle for our table - oh so romantic!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, got to try a few different items:  1. Pastor fries, super size (the \"small\" one) - some of the best I've ever had.  They layer the meat and cheese which is nice instead of just dumping it on top, and the pastor is charred all around the edges  2. Chicken fajita combo - huge portion, probably enough for two meals, and the chicken was super juicy with great seasoning  3. Chorizo breakfast burrito - better than Roberto's and I'm a big fan of breakfast burritos at Roberto's...the burrito was gigantic, probably equivalent to two burritos at most other places.    Everything was awesome and their prices include tax.  $25 was the total for what must have been 6-7 pounds of food."}
{"text":"Wow great food and great service. Met the owner Ben and he has so much passion. First time here and this is now my favorite restaurant. I will visit this place every time I'm in vegas.  I had the chimichanga and the shrimp burrito. Both were amazing. If you like spicy food try the shrimp burrito PERFECT!!  Alex-"}
{"text":"I grew up in San Diego and there really isn't anything like good old San Diego taco shop. Due to my husband being in the military we have lived all over, not one place could ever compare to San Diego's mexican food. When  we moved to Las Vegas I was so excited because there were taco shops everywhere but still nothing like San Diego. Until now!! This place is the best. There might be a wait... so what. Good food should take time. Try ordering online. This is good old taco shop and in my opinion the best in all of Las Vegas!! Go and try it, you won't be disappointed. Trust me and if for some strange reason you don't like it, well you just don't know good old taco shop."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way out of town. Eric was super friendly. Had Breakfast burritos. Green sauce is Killer and the red is nice and HOT. You can't go wrong!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was one of those nights when I crave for Tacos. So I finally decided to try Jefe's out based on fellow Yelpers and had it bookmarked for awhile. I even passed on having Filipino Chicken Adobo last night, even through my mom's adobo is \"the Bomb.\"    As I arrived at the Sinclair gas station based on the directions provided by Yelpers. I was able to locate the shop in reasonable time. There were a few cars in the parking lot that had occupants eating tacos or burritos. I knew that this place had to be worth visiting cause a good portion of the customer were heading or leaving Jefe's inside.   The staff was very friendly and immediately ask me if I found this place through Yelp. I responded with, \"Yes\" with my hungry looking eyes. I ended up getting combo #5 shredded beef tacos with 4 corn tortillas. Every bite was delicious and the beef was seasoned just right with pieces of bell pepper. The corn tortillas were simply delicious and doesn't have that aftertaste of preservatives. Overall a great place to grab delicious Mexican food with great customer service!"}
{"text":"The first three times I ordered a carne Asada burrito it was delicious, the last two visits the taste in the meet isn't the same anymore. Not sure what happened, but I hope I can get the same delicious flavor it had when I discovered this place."}
{"text":"Really good food. It is located inside of Sinclair and the food is very good.  Fresh ingredients made to order right in front of you.  The quality of the product is fantastic.  If there was one knock, I would say the prices are mildly higher than a Roberto's, but that is likely because the ingredients are a bit superior.  Each of our burritos was $9 which is not a fortune, but if you are used to paying $7, it is a bit steeper.  However, you get what you pay for... :)"}
{"text":"Its definitely not that good, and that's not authentic mexican food, more like texmex"}
{"text":"I may have had the best street tacos I have ever had. So tasty and authentic.  Good value, great service and the perfect fix for lunch.  Will be back often!"}
{"text":"The management is great, very nice people. This is completely worth it do not be turned away by the fact that it is in a gas station. Never had a bad thing here. Gotta get those carne Asada fries!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here. I must say this has to be the BEST Mexican restaurant I've been to in a very long time! The food is to die for, with nice size portions, amthe service was also impeccable. Thought the owner, Ben, was very personable. I urge everyone to go try Jefe's!"}
{"text":"Came to this place since it had great Yelp reviews, but I wasn't that impressed. First, it's located in a gas station, which I didn't expect. Horchata was super watery, and the prices listed are wrong. They have a tv screen showing that 3 mini tacos are $5, not bad. When I paid it was actually $6. I had the carnitas tacos, and they were actually pretty good, just took a long time to make."}
{"text":"Oops got here at 8:08 this morning and they weren't ready to serve breakfast burritos sorry would have liked the breakfast burritos from Jefes today."}
{"text":"AWESOME FOOD! The breakfast burritos are of the chain! I'm not sure if the guys name is Jefe, but he slay those burritos!!! You are definitely getting your money's worth because one burrito weighs about 3 to 5 lbs. DELICIOUS! I definitely recommend this place. Just a heads up, don't be turned off by the location. It is inside a gas station; however, there is a park near by where you can go and eat. YOU WON'T REGRET THOSE BURRITOS!"}
{"text":"Great tasting and quality Mexican food.  It'll hit the spot every time.  Leave happy."}
{"text":"I seen this on yelp when checking out what good Mexican places there was to eat, it is Located inside of Sinclair gas station which was easy to find, I got the Jefe's burrito, It was good, the Sauce inside was like a gyro cream, I also got 3 al pastor mini tacos which were amazing and 3 carne asada tacos which were amazing as well,  I checked in and got a Free horchata which wasn't to bad, wished it was a bit more creamy to my liking but was very refreshing, my son drunk it up before we could get home, so he deft was a big fan of it. overall this place is a gem and we will deft come back"}
{"text":"California burrito was pretty good! I ended up here so I didn't have to go out of my way for Roberto's.   You can tell the ingredients were fresh in my burrito, and everything in it was delicious.   The price is reasonable and I would eat here again.   The owner works at the joint and is a pretty cool dude. He put his money where his mouth is and told me if I didn't like it he'd refund me 100%.  Keep the money, Ben. You earned it with that burrito."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!! All I can say is that Chimichanga was the best I've ever had!! Thank you Ben for being so personable and outgoing.. I will most definitely be back and hopefully very soon!!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I only ate the deliciousness of Jefe's, I didn't personally interact with any of the employees or go into the restaurant.   With that being said, YUM! Seriously, sooo good!  My husband went and picked up dinner for us last night while I stayed home with the babe. He came home and told me how friendly everyone there was while we inhaled our food. I could barely pause between bites to answer him. It was SO good. EXACTLY the same as the taco shops in San Diego, which I've missed terribly since we moved away. My husband got the smaller portion of carne asada fries and still had leftovers to take to work with him today. They make high quality food and don't skimp on the good stuff at all. We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite SOCAL style Mexican food place. I used to be a big fan of Roberto's until I ate here. I will never eat Roberto's again as long as I can get my taco fix at Jefe's! Their breakfast burritos are huge and taste amazing, but my absolute favorite is their mini street tacos, carne asada! If you want to taste some authentic Mexican food go to Jefe's. They also have some of the best customers service I've ever experienced. They strive at giving you their best both in the taste of their food and their customers service. If you haven't been there yet you are definitely cheating your taste buds! When any of my family comes to visit I WILL DEFINITELY TAKE THEM THERE so that they can experience the delightful taste of Jefe's Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Bomb. If your looking for a bomb pick up and go taco spot its hear. Customer service if excellent. When I seen the reviews I wanted to check it out when I got their I was a little like really, when I seen the prices I thought a little expensive for tacos and burritos. So I ordered the Asada burrito when it came out it was twice the size as a regular taco spot ( Roberto's- pepes) and the meat was cooked fresh haven't seen that before and it was perfect, taste was on point. This will definitely be my taco spot from now on. BOMB"}
{"text":"5 stars,good clean food and the customer service is number one.i'm always busy but every time I stop by,I leave with a smile.Respectfully,Buche!!!!"}
{"text":"The Chile relleno burrito and jefe's burrito are delicious!  First time stopping in and were amazed by the quality of the food.  Even the green and red salsa has great flavor and a spicy kick!  A must try!!!"}
{"text":"What a truly lovely experience! Ben is an all around awesome person, I felt very welcomed and a very personable experience. The customer service care was beyond exceptional, there was definitely a nice vibe and good conversation. And the food omg.. I love tacos and these are definitely now on my top 3 list. I can't wait to go back and try a burrito! Ask Ben to show you the tortillas, promise you'll want one too!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best \"hole in the wall\" spots I've been to in years! Fresh home-made tortillas, great steak, people are amazing! I came with a party of 10 ppl and the food was fast, delicious and prefer was perfect. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great taco shop, friendly owner.  Tried a carnita, carne, and al pastor taco plate.  The carnita was my favorite, it wasn't dried out, goes great with their green salsa.  My only complaint about the pastor, it had no pineapple in it.  Their street tacos have more meat than most places also.  Definitely will be back sometime."}
{"text":"Yo. This food is amazing! I meant to take a picture but I started eating it once I got home. I literally turned Netflix on and went in! Lol. I ordered the 12 rolled tacos for my kids...thinking they were going to be skimpy and they would need to eat 6 each. These were very nice sized and my kids left 6 in the box. The chicken was so good inside the taquitos! I'm weary with a lot of Mexican food places and their chicken. It always tastes weird but this was on point!!! So I ordered the carnitas chimichanga. When I tell you I got through 1/3 of this thing before I felt like I was gonna pass out. This thing is HUGE!!!!!!  It is fillllllllllllllled with carnitas and beans and cheese...but mostly carnitas! HOOOOOOMYYYYYGAWD so good!!!!!!!!!  Please be aware... when I tell you its huge....its HUGE! So be prepared. I also ordered fries...and I shouldn't have but they were good too. Overall I spent about 30.00 but obviously this was worth it because I'm gonna pop that chimichanga in the toaster oven tomorrow for my lunch and be in heaven all over again. I met the Jefe, Ben, tonight and what a cool dude! I got a free drink because it was my first visit! The female cook and the younger guy at the register were soooooo nice and accommodating. Even though I live in Summerlin I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First of all, Ben the owner and his daughter are incredible hosts! The tacos here are absolutely on point - we've had tacos in Mexico and in San Diego and Jefe's blends the best of both worlds with seriously high quality protein. Great drinks as well - both the horchata and limon are tasty, authentic and not too sweet.   This is definitely our go-to taco shop now in Vegas"}
{"text":"Came in tonight for the first time, and I have found my new taco spot!!! The soy chorizo street tacos fit the spot! The hubby got carnitas, carne asada, and pastor tacos all of which were perfect!! Not to mention the amazing customer service!! Definitely be back...soon!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Great tasting tacos & food! That's coming from someone who knows tacos from TJ. The customer service was 10/10 they made me feel welcomed. You can tell they really care about their guest. And I mean guest not customers because they treat you like as if you were at their home. If you eat at Roberto's often, this place is worth your switch. Better prices, better quality, better food."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place and I did.  Jefe's Taco Shop sure gets a lot of Yelp love with a 5 star average.  I admit it.  I was a little skeptical about the reviews, especially since I didn't know many of the Yeeps that reviewed this place.  But then I tried them for myself and Voila!  5 Stars from me too.    5 for 5!  Here are my 5 reasons for giving Jefe's 5 Stars.   1.  The service here is consistent.  You can say it's hit or hit.  Service is awesome.  Ben, the owner, is awesome.  Plus, he's from America's Finest City.  That makes him awesomer.    2.  The Breakfast Burrito:  It's huge and can feed a party of 4.  Or, just one Mel C.  Ben didn't think I can finish a Breakfast Burrito with extra extra meat, an order of rolled tacos, a street taco, and a quesadilla in one sitting.  Guess What?  That's right. I deMELished it.  I was full and wanted to quit.  But when something taste so good, you just don't want to give up.   3.  The Beef Rolled Tacos w/Sour Cream & Cheese:  So good, crispy, tasty, and had a lot of meat.   4.  Price: Everything is priced about right.  Remember, portions are huge.    5.  Home:  Yes, Jefe's reminds me of home. In my opinion, nobody does taco shops as good as the 619.  Jefe's comes pretty damn close.  Bottom line...if I could afford the calories, I'd be here every day.    TIP:  Don't get this place confused with Tacos El Jefe's off Charleston.  Not even close."}
{"text":"First time for the hubby and I on our way to Mt. Charleston... dang. It lives up to the five stars.   Delicious food and kind, friendly service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this.  When I came in, the owner educated me on the food.  Now I have some experience with the food.  Well In the last year I have ate at probably a dozen taquerias in town and had home cooked Mexican food (perks of dating a Mexican).  I wanted to just hear the speel to see where their heart was at.  It's in the food!    Tortilla lightly cooked for that texture you need.  Street tacos are simple enough, meat onions and cilantro.  The carne was well seasoned and marinated.  Adoba was great.  Even some of the sweetness was still in it.  Nice and blackened for that crunch.  They use lard which does make a difference.  That is an important quality in any Mexican kitchen.  Only thing to say is the red sauce was amazingly hot... Manny did not lie.  It is a straight chili sauce so don't pour it everywhere thinking it's Taco Bell.    Closest to eating my fiancée cooking without asking her to do so.  Keep it up.  Mr. Roberto will be happy to see the legacy continue."}
{"text":"If I could give these guys more than 5 stars, I definitely would!  Their service is amazing, the place is very clean, and I finally found a place where they make California burritos the right way.  I came from San Diego and since I moved here, I've been missing the way Mexican food is in SD and now I have a favorite place to go whenever I'm missing Cali. I had a very good first visit, and I will definitely come back again very soon! Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Been a wile since I been here sent a few people over and they loved it as well aka pastor fries with bacon yacht c ... if you like great good and great people then this is your place !!!! Just wrecked a pastor burrito and it was the bizomb !!!! I can't wait to go back you guys rock !!!"}
{"text":"I am still thinking and bragging about this amazing Carne Asada taco I had there a week ago. Ben is awesome and he doesbtake care of his custmers. It has taken everything in me to wait to return for that goodness there because I don't want to overload my senses on their amazing food. Whooosaaaa."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  Worth it to stop in and meet Manny he is super friendly and great customer service speaks English very well.  This is a family owed business and they take pride in there product. Which is amazing. My husband got the chimichanga burrito. I got the adobda mini tacos and the rolled tacos. Great mexican food.  You know it's good when mexicanas eat there.  When we came up two little ladies of mexican descent where there we asked them how the food was and they said  this was their second visit this week.  I'm mexican as well as my spouse so no disrespect intended. The food was ample portions for the price Manny did say there was going to be a price change but better quality meat. Hopefully those price increases won't be too high.  Overall good quality food for the price and definitely will be back.  Also with your yelp check in you may be able to get a free drink.  It's 100% honored here and Manny gave us a free refill."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious and the burritos are large. Their red and green sauces are the best. The customer service shines. They go above and beyond to make the customers feel welcome. However, I feel they made a mistake raising their prices shortly after opening. It's too expensive for a lunch now.  Being in a gas station gives low overhead costs so it seems greedy to have higher prices than others that pay thousands a month for a storefront. With the larger portions but with low rent, they should be in the same price range. I quit going there because of the high prices. $10 for a burrito is what you would pay in a sit down nice restaurant, not a gas station. Go back to Robertos and Gerardos prices and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After a rough couple of days, I came home to a delicious meal from Jefe's Taco Shop!  This made my week!  The homemade tortillas taste like someone's grandma made them.  The beef is juicy and full of flavor!  Ben the owner didn't forget the sides. Rice and beans are unlike any I've tasted.  He must use bacon or really good seasoning.  The guac is smooth, creamy and so fresh tasting.  He gives plenty of it!  Pico Is perfect!  My only regret is not going to Jefe's myself.  Visiting Ben is part of the experience.  Thanks Jefe's Taco Shop."}
{"text":"This place is so good if your in the mood for whats considered fast food mexican!  Dont let the location inside the gas station fool you. The owners are so nice and make sure each and every time that you are happy and pleased with your food and that they meet there customers expectations every time. If your looking for cheap mexican food this is not the place, but if your looking for quality and freshness in your food this is the place to go! It's like they say you pay for the quality you are receiving!"}
{"text":"Found this place today, hidden gem of a taco shop inside the gas station. I had the three mini tacos de lengua with some salsa verde. Ben the owner was really awesome and personable we chatted for a while about cars while the order was being made. It was so good I went back later after running errands for an al pastor torta. Again so good look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Wanted good grub for a road trip to St. George, Utah, and this perfectly hit the spot. So much so, that I'm gamed for driving out of my way for another of their burritos. Thanks for the rec., fellow Yelpers.  Food - Quite pleasantly surprised and pleased! My carne asada burrito was very very good. Having had many Mission style burritos from San Francisco, this ranks up high with any of the good ones. There was way too much carne asada stuffed inside for my personal taste, but it'll be a treat for carnivores. I had enough to use the next day with my homemade omelette.  Cleanliness - Very clean for a taqueria, and especially clean for being inside a gas station.   Service - Owner was super nice and was there with his wife and young son; it's a family business. Patronize this nice hard working family.  TIP - Be sure to take advantage of their free drink Yelp check in offer too."}
{"text":"Always on point.   Always fresh and great customer service.   They listen to you when you ask for specific things on your food or how you want things cooked!    they don't make a big deal or under cook your shit on purpose like algobertos down the street.    The portions are amazing here at Jefes and they just actually care when cooking for you. The owner is super awesome as well and makes himself present because he's wants things done correct..   Unlike algobertos down the street..    Jefes all the way. Don't pass this little hole in the wall up. Great food great prices!!   Always fresh!"}
{"text":"It may be in a gas station but who cares!? You have to try this place. We ordered carna asada fries - which were HUGE. And my husband ordered carna asada quesadilla - which was again, HUGE. This might have been the best carna asada I have ever had! Their tortillas were unbelievable good. The owner was super friendly and gave us free drinks just because we were new. It seemed very popular with a steady flow of people coming in with only wonderful things to say. I can't wait to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"TOP NOTCH CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! While at the counter, Manny was speaking with other customers and he quickly replied \"sir, I'll be right with you in a moment.\" This is good customer service right here and the acknowledgment goes a long way. I ended up getting the carne asada/pollo asada tacos and the rolled tacos. They are generous with their portions, fair with their prices and the food is absolutely delicious.   Manny also took the time to offer me one of their beverages and discussed a brief history of the business. They really care about their customers and go out of their way to make you feel at home. The location is inside a gas station so don't let that deter you from giving them a try. I have found my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant in Vegas and I'll definitely be returning. Thank you Manny!"}
{"text":"In my experience these hole in the wall places always seem to deliver!  I had the carne asada nachos and my husband the carne asada burrito. Both were on point. First time here. Will have to try some of their other meats next time. Will definitely be back. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Come here for the mini tj street tacos deep fried hard tacos Jefe's burrito! Service is super friendly but a tad slow. Order with their app for faster service . Just so you know it is in a gas station so let this stop you if your a fan of tacos el gordo and robertos this place blows them out of the water!!!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place, waited so long since they're not open on Sundays and Mondays. Anyways decided to go pick up food after work and got a little lost at first, but that's ok. When I got there, staff was super nice and friendly, with great customer service. I had to wait like 15 minutes for my food, but it wasn't problem. Overall it was good Mexican fast food, but I wasn't impressed or amazed, it was ok.  Forgot to mention they give you free drink with Yelp check in or if you're a new customer :)"}
{"text":"We came in 20 min before closing and while driving here we passed it (not knowing it being located in a gas station)  Ben greeted us warmly, asked our first names then shook our hands. He gave us a brief run down of the restaurant since there were at least 3 regulars behind us-and all were letting us know. Once you go Jefe's you won't go back, or you'll NEVER want anything else. With that being said.... My expectations were high. And holy s#*t they were met!  We ordered 3 pollo al pastor tacos, carne asada fries, 3 beef tacos, and a quesadilla made with Monterey Jack cheese carne asada & bacon! I canme with 5 other people (just wanna throw that out there....) it was our first time and we all got free drinks and refills. Ok back to the food.... The  carne asada is amazing the seasoning is FIRE the pollo al pastor omg! And the fries bomb! The freshness of the food is so good especially for being a gas station restaurant the quality and quantity is AMAZING! Prices are sweet too what you see on the menu is the price tax has already been added.  3 tacos for 6$ can't beat it!"}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! It won't let you stay in shape. Foods ridiculous. I'm convinced they sprinkle crack on it. So good I'm writing a review and I didn't even have their food today they're closed but we were thinking of having Mexican. Try the breakfast burrito with everything, and any kinda nach/fries!! Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"The best customer service I ever had,. This place is a must if you're a burrito and taco lover"}
{"text":"Five stars for the food! Absolutely delicious... The service was extremely friendly (perhaps slightly more than warranted). Not the quickest, but good food takes time, & this was certainly worth the wait (15 min or so). I was looking for something fast in the Cenntennial Hills area, & came across this place. With so many great reviews, I thought I'd give it a try.   It's located inside a gas station, so don't expect a lot of pomp & circumstance.  I got the monster breakfast burrito w/ chorizo & grilled peppers & onions. My gf got a California burrito with beans instead of steak. Everything was cooked perfectly, & their green & red sauces are both delicious. The cook/possible owner was incredibly accommodating (though you're out of luck if you're vegan).   I don't live anywhere near this place, but I may take a trip back to the area. It was that tasty."}
{"text":"Love this place, hole in the wall in a gas station with 4 tables so we get it to go. Everything is good. I'm hooked. We live like 20 min away and still come here. Asada fries, tacos, burritos, and TOSTADAS! It's all Gucci. You won't be disappointed. The service is good, they're all happy."}
{"text":"Coming from LA, the food is overpriced. My Lengua burrito tasted good, but again, not good enough for me to justify their prices."}
{"text":"I have to say finding this place was serendipitous. I had just ran out of gas and was able to roll up to a gas pump. I went inside to pay and smelled delicious, well seasoned meat sizzling away on a grill. I'm like...hold up. There's a taco joint in here?   I wasn't too hungry, but I could eat. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos--which were seasoned to perfection. So of course I was obliged to return. I came back the next day to get a burrito. Returned the next for a chimichanga.   I think the bottom line here is I may require rehab. I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Recently went to check it out. I bought a Chimichanga Combo with beans, guac, and sour cream on the side. This was the biggest chimichanga I've ever eaten. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"It was my first time there, and they already treated me like family. They were very, very friendly! It was the best Mexican food I've had in my life,none of the other mexican places I've been to don't compare to this one because this was so indescribably good! They also said that if you have straight A's in school, and show them your report card, you get a free burrito, any burrito!! I can't thank them enough for the really great service and food. I'm definitely going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Great spot inside a gas station. They care about your customer experience and strive to get your 5 star Yelp review. Honestly it's a mentality that more restaurants should adopt. Generous and kind guys work the place who want you to have a good dining experience.   I had the California burrito. It was tasty and fresh, beats Robertos by a mile. They use real avocado in their guacamole and their salsa Roja and salsa Verde aren't watered down versions of what they should be. They're flavorful. The fries in the California burrito were crisp, not soggy. The burritos are huge. Theyre a bit more expensive than robertos but it's worth it knowing that your food was cooked for you fresh and they're not cutting corners every place they can.   Tell them it's your first time and they will hook you up and your panties will drop."}
{"text":"Forget Alberto's. Jefe's is on point. Excellent service and very tasty grub. Definitely recommend this joint."}
{"text":"First time here, best Mexican food I've had in a long time. Carne Asada  was to die for, everything was delicious. Me and my boyfriend are white af so we both appreciated nothing was spicy. Just pure deliciousness."}
{"text":"My go to place whenever I want tacos or nachos or burritos or anything! Best service and I always feel welcomed! The food taste better when it comes from people who are friendly and care about their customers! Really can't beat this place! It might be in a gas station but it's honestly the best of the best when it comes to the food and the service!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I haven't found Mexican food here in Vegas that is as good as this place! The service is amazing and the food is made fresh when you order so sometimes it takes a little bit of time but well worth it! So definitely order online if you can! The owner is a great person, he remembers us every time we go in! Amazing personal touch!"}
{"text":"Love love love everything about this place!!! The staff is amazing and so friendly and the food is beyond excellent. The burritos are so flipping huge that it turns into lunch and dinner... And possibly breakfast!! Do NOT be fooled by the location. The only thing that I would say is a down side is that it isn't open everyday!! But maybe that's a good Thing cuz I'd be huge by now lol"}
{"text":"First of all, don't be put off by their location in a gas station. It's a plus, because you can pick up some beer from the gas station while waiting for your food. The service was great, and they are proud of their food. The owner was there, and we got to share a little bit about how we both lived in San Diego before and the fact that the menu is based on the Mexican food in that fine city.  I ordered the smaller size carne asada fries, and the quantity was overwhelming, but in the best way. And the flavor is exactly what I was used to and hoping for. I highly recommend this place and will happily return whenever I'm in the area. I would have returned on my quick trip to Las Vegas if I had had more time."}
{"text":"Normally when you think of mexican food in a gas station, its an immediate \"no no\". Prepare yourself to be pleasantly surprised. The customer service is absolutely top notch. The food can be a bit more in pricey however you get more bang for your buck with the large portions. Overall the food is delicious, they have the REAL california burrito, and I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"We discovered this hidden gem while in the area after dance class. The owner is very nice and accommodating! Definitely will be back. We always get a mulita and their steak quesadillas."}
{"text":"The Carne Asada burrito was great!  Generous in size, will have more for later.  The meat was very tender, salsa was tasty too.  Since this was my first time here, we're given a complimentary drink. Very nice staff."}
{"text":"Yes it is in the Sinclair Gas Station... the friendly service won us over!!! Ben R was extremely accommodating and charming!! First time my hubby and I went for dinner.   It was extremely sweet of Ben to bring our food plus a candle to make the dinning experience romantic!  Tacos  are delicious and the Al Pastor Nachos were Wonderful!   Ben R suggestion to add the \"Mexican Crack\""}
{"text":"I really don't know what else I can say that the other reviews haven't. It deserves at least 20 stars for customer service alone, but the food! My god the food is on a whole other level. Do not let the fact that's its in a gas station dissuade you. Fresh meat. Delicious cheese. Huge portions. Cheap prices. I LOVE THIS PLACE! Although I just visited last night for the first time, I already referred four other people and when they went in, the owner remembered who I was BY NAME. That says a lot about the pride in customer service that they have. You even get a free drink on your first visit, the online ordering system is amazing, and they give you a free meal on your birthday! As soon as I finish this review, I'm heading there! You should do the same!!"}
{"text":"Great service. We stopped in on our vacation and had a great experience. Although the gas station leaves something to be desired the food and service make up for it. We each ordered something different and it was all delicious."}
{"text":"This place is so Great !!!!the owner is the nicest guy .. and the amount of food they give u is actualy rediculous lol ... not in the bad way ...i eat like a beast .... and let me tellbu tjis place fullfils my hunger ... this place is a gem .. and goes in my top list of vegas best mexican food !!! :D i must truly say this is the best custmer service on the planet. .this guy really goes above and beyond to make his customerw  have a great experience ...wish i would of took pic ... but was too hungry to do so..."}
{"text":"They forgot my order. Again.   Placed an order online to be picked up at 4:45. I walked in at 4:40 and stood there while a female employee told me she would be right with me then went to lazily go clean. Um...Ok?  A white guy came out, super nice and friendly, and asked if I already ordered. I said \"yeah it was an online order for *my name*\". He looked confused, went to the back, and I heard the stove start sizzling. Clearly they forgot because they didn't ask what I ordered, they just ran back to start cooking.  It was over ten minutes later when they had my food ready. However, they said they ran out of the horchata I orderex and were just now making it. Another ten minutes. All of this could have been avoided if they had looked at my online order when they received it hours ahead.  I left with my order around 5. The horchata was so poorly done in a rush, it just tastes like warm water with cinnamon. They even told me to get my own ice in the gas station (not in a mean way but still). I had to throw it away.  This is one of my favorite Mexican places in all of Vegas but about 75% of the time, our online orders are forgotten or barely started at the pick up time, and when we order in house, the wait is about 30 minutes just for food for my husband and I.  I love the food and the owner is a great guy but please please PLEASE pay attention to orders placed or called in ahead because this is done for a reason. We don't have time to come in and wait 15-20 minutes passed the promise ready time. I order pick up a lot at restaurants and stores because it's what I need so when I have to get off and wait 20 minutes, it really does affect my job and my errands.  We continued coming here because the food rocks but this will be my last time. 20 minutes passed, forgotten food, rushed and gross horchata even after I tipped is not okay. And like I said, these delays happen almost all the time I'll find a new spot for Mexican food. Such a shame. :-("}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the food and service.  Talked with Ben and Manny and the service was probably something you would expect at a nice steakhouse.  They greet you like your family and small talk with you while the food is being prepared.  The service was fantastic and couldn't say anything negative it really caught me off guard as I was expecting something similar to Robertos.  The food was amazing I ordered the pork fries.  The pork was packed with flavor and the size is out of this world.  Overall 5/5 for service and 5/5 for food.  Next time you are thinking of getting some food in the area definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is as great as everyone says. Don't bother that it's in a gas station, the food is great, the horchata is okay. Jefe's burrito is amazing. The gas station employees are super nice too."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, the food was amazing. I got a Jefe's burrito and everything tasted fresh and was just all around great. The next time I came was an even better experience. I got to talk to Jefe while I waited on my food, and he seems like a great guy. The food was as good as I remembered, so it's consistently great.  When you throw the address to Jefe's into your phone and your gps tells you you've arrived and it's a gas station, don't be sketched out. Go in and treat yourself. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Blanca was very helpful this morning when I came in to order my food. She took my info down for the free birthday meal. The food was prepared pretty quick considering there was a few orders ahead of me. Finally, the food review. I'll keep it short. It was on point. I will definitely be returning. We usually order mexican food from a taco shop down the road, but after eating here today we have our new food joint."}
{"text":"Delicious. Amazing quality food and customer service. They close at 10pm and like an asshole I came in at 9:45(I was off work late and starving) and they made fresh everything. Really really good."}
{"text":"THE BEST!! The Asada Fries couldn't taste any better. The fries were not too crispy or too soggy. Perfect amount of meat and toppings. If you're a fan of Crispy Carnitas, this is the place!  Too many places don't fry them the way they should. Real avocado in the Guacamole, not just a green sauce. The Chile has some kick but not too much which is great....  Not food related, but worth mentioning. If you need to learn customer service, hang out and talk to, or just listen to Ben for a minute. You couldn't meet a friendlier more engaging guy! The food and the service does NOT Disappoint!"}
{"text":"Definitely way better than Roberto's or any other taco shop....portions are huge and awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in town! It's in the gas station. Can't beat the price! Really good people overall! Wut up Uce!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food I've had in years! I have been searching for the best asada for a long time and this place even beats Tacos el Gordo. The owner Ben is very friendly and has great customer service. He knew all about my keto diet and created a \"burrito\" bowl special for me. He even offered a free drink while I waited for my freshly made food! I ordered the Jefe burrito bowl with added cheese which was so filling I could only eat half! My husband ordered the asada burrito and Ben added beans and rice at no extra charge! My brother got a grilled chicken taco salad. The shrimp, chicken and steak were perfectly seasoned and grilled without all those weird fatty chunks most Mexican restaurants have. They really care about your whole experience here...don't be fooled by the gas station, the best places are always hidden like that! Next time I want to try one of their breakfast burrito bowls! I will be back regularly for sure."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times I work around the corner best tacos for this side of town for sure customer service is at an all-time premium not to mention the food is good quality"}
{"text":"I came here on 12/21/2016 hoping to find a place that offers up some great Mexican food.  I was more than impressed by how wonderful the food was and how nice the cashier Paola was!  I ordered the shredded beef enchilada combination along with a couple of deep fried chicken tacos. One word:  OUTSTANDING!!  I am already looking forward to my next visit. Kudos to Jefe's for being top notch!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service on top of great food!  Chef owner takes pride in the food quality and ensuring the customers are satisfied 100%!    Portions for burritos are huge!  Tortillas are from San Diego and are one of a kind.  Not like any other flour tortillas from Robertos.  Quality meat and fresh home made sauces that are perfect addition to quality meal.    My new fav crave for sure!"}
{"text":"Nachos are awesome. The same with their breakfast burrito. Enough for two. Ask to have it sliced in half."}
{"text":"Food was okay, prices are higher than robertos but more quality. The lady that took my order was extremely rude, didn't greet me and gave attitude when i asked a simple question However the man in charge was extremely nice wish he would hire more people like him. A complete gentleman."}
{"text":"First visit to El Jefes Tacos, they hooked me up with  a free drink for my first visit. And suggested I give my name every time I come for a free dinner on my birthday.  I had a California burrito with meat, fries, quac, cheese and sour cream. It was a great burrito full of flavor the tortilla was super fresh and flavorful. Best part was he staff super friendly made me feel at home.  I'll be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say. Jefes Taco Shop is the best Vegas has to offer. Love how it brings a little San Diego to the valley. Great service, great food. Do yourself a favor and get over there."}
{"text":"Oh, man, everything here is top notch, San Diego style Mexican. The refried beans are super amazing.   Certified Angus Beef, too.   If you don't know what to pick, just ask. They'll guide you to your treasure. Of course, the owner is super friendly.   I just wish they were closer to the house!"}
{"text":"Delicious food at great prices! Customer service is amazing. Be aware, the carne asada fries are GIGANTIC.   Don't be fooled by the gas station location. It's SO worth a visit!!"}
{"text":"The sausage breakfast burrito has never let me down! Ben and his team are doing great things in this place!"}
{"text":"We have been dying to try their food, and finally did. Three times. All three times the food was delicious. Service was just awesome. So why the four stars and not five? Their red and green salsa that you can ask for is just not good at all. It has no depth of flavor and is just plain hot. I am a huge spicy food fan and can eat very spicy levels of food or sauces. I wish the owners of Jefes would sneak over to Algoberto's and try all their salsas in the salsa bar. Not only are they spicy, but you can taste the garlic, onion, and tomatoes in their salsa. It makes it difficult for me to get food at Jefes when there is nothing for me to spice up my burritos and tacos with. I hope the owners read my review and take it to heart. Note: I am from Los Angeles and grew up eating salsa and spicy food daily. So I am very accustomed to spicy food.   Ben R.  I knew you would read my review, because it is very obvious that you care about your business. You are very wise Ben:) FYI, I'm not a fan of green salsa for the most part. The two salsas that I always get at You-Know-Where, is their real deep red salsa, and one that is reddish brown and chunky."}
{"text":"First off, the location is in a gas station, but don't let it deter you. It's clean, and everyone who works there is friendly enough. I was on a business trip, and I checked Yelp for the best Mexican food in the area. To be honest, as nice as everyone was, I've has much better food. Tortilla's were dry, and I hate that on tacos. I feel like the meat tasted like the grill hadn't been cleaned in a while, or maybe it's just really old. Beans weren't great, but maybe my expectations are too high, as my favorite are my grandmas. Either way, the line was insanely long, for how average the food was. I traveled a bit to try it as well. I'm from Chicago, and I've had better Mexican food here. I don't like when owners are really high on their Yelp page either. The guy, Ben, seemed to want to assure people spoke to him before they posted on Yelp. I don't like that. You can make something right, but a review is a review, and it's based on first impressions. Mine wasn't great, but it seems like he's able to convince everyone else to talk to him before posting, as they have almost no bad reviews."}
{"text":"Jefe's Tacos has really good food, I have tried their Carne Asada fries, California burritos, chimichangas, and tortas. I can't say that I like one over the other because all the food there is so delicious, and taste fresh. There is a new item that is not on their menu yet called\"La Gringa\". I tried it last night and I have to say it was really delicious, and most likely will order it again in the future. If you find yourself in Jefe's tacos and are not sure of what to get, I highly suggest you try this new item you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had carnitas tacos. They were crispy and had a good flavor.  Carne asada tacos were good too. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"This is by far and away my favorite taco shop in town and I have been to them all. It's in a gas station but don't let that stop you from coming in. The pastor (fries, burrito etc) is my meat of choice. It's made from the tenderloin and is to die for. I come 2-3 per month and it's consistent every time. Ben has phenomenal customer service skills and always has a smile.   I can't recommend this place enough. Try it once and you will be hooked!!"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time after tasting at the taco festival a while back . I was not disappointed, the food was amazing and the customer service was excellent, great to go to a place and feel like your taken care of , I will be back"}
{"text":"Hi. The best Mexican food all the menu is great the service is the best in Las Vegas no taco shop have the same cuality of service and food. The meat in EL JEFES TACO SHOP is the best from any taco shop."}
{"text":"Hands down best quick service Mexican food in Vegas.  Fresh ingredients, great flavors, and huge portions.  I'm completely addicted to this place.  I usually go twice a week and I love the online ordering system.  It makes it so much easier to order and pick up your food.  Plus it gives you more time to chill out and talk with Ben, the owner.  What a character.  He is by far one of the funniest and cool dudes in Vegas.  Truly cares about 100% satisfaction for his customers.  This place is a real gem and so needed in the northwest part of Vegas.  This ain't no Robertos.  If you want real quality Mexican food with bold flavors, check out Jefes."}
{"text":"I'm not even kidding when I say these are the best burritos of my LIFE!   I've gotten a different burrito before, and since I plan on making another trip before I go back to California, I decided to go with what my tummy wanted, which was the spicy shrimp burrito. It had peppers, tomato paste, spanish rice and lots of delicious shrimp in it.    The sauce is that perfect spiciness that doesn't need any extra chile on top and oh God,  their shrimps are perfectly cooked, plump, and plentiful. Every bite is AMAZING!  I couldn't finish the rest of my burrito firstly because it was amazing and delicious and the sauce has that nice medium kick you can still feel in your mouth, but it's not a burning ache, it's more of a nice slow roast.   And secondly, their burritos are ENORMOUS, I'm pretty sure they're about the size of my forearm and SO you can always grub on leftovers as well.   The customer service was awesome,  checking in our food,  asking if we needed refills, I've gotten better service in this small restaurant inside a gas station than at some fancier places in SoCal.   My congratulations to the owners on their new baby,  apparently wife was AT WORK having contractions,  and still closed up shop for the day  before heading to the hospital. Dedicated!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  Awesome customer service and exceptional food! The portions are huge. You definitely get the best bang for your buck! I might go as far to say this is my FAVORITE Mexican food spot in town!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Way better than the other taco guy up the street and well worth the wait. Food is always fresh, hot and on point."}
{"text":"I was looking for a taquiera near my house and this was the first place on the list. All the reviews it had were 5 stars, so I had to try it. I got 3 Al Pastor and 3 Carne Asada mini tacos. I will say this place is legit! All the reviews are true! I will be definitely a regular. This place is really good!"}
{"text":"The Best Mexican Food Restaurant in the NW Las Vegas Area..... Do your stomach a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"Went for a basic cheese enchilada combo. Service was extremely slow and with few patrons.After 15 minutes I got my order, enchiladas were ok, but the beans and rice were overly salty and over done. Even the red sauce was high intensive sodium. Ease up guys!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places to get a burrito in Vegas this place comes from San Diego burritos run from 10 to $12 inside a gas station yes inside a gas station but worth 10 $12 for a burrito  100% worth it very friendly check them out"}
{"text":"My son's father put me on to this  place. I was surprised bring that it's inside of a gas station / liquor store. The food is really good and the service is awesome. We now eat there once a week or so. It does take a little while to get your order because they are so busy and usually have one cook but you can order online which makes in very convenient. With the owner and employees working to provide good food, we will always pick this place first for our taco, burrito needs."}
{"text":"Jefe's gets three stars because while their California Burrito is AMAZING (I'll give them 5 stars for that) their customer service is lagging.  They never answer the phone and insist that you use their app or online ordering.  I'm not a fan of ordering on the app or online because I like to pay for cash for everything and don't want to hook up a debit/credit card.  Also when you pick up your order the owner is a little annoying and tells the same jokes every time you go in.  The Roberto's taco shop joke is not funny.  He is also a little pushy and has an attitude.  His business does well and his food is good quality for the price point. Highly recommend the food  especially the green hot sauce.  But don't get your hopes up for a \"Soft around the edges\" conversationalist.  Also nothing vegetarian here...beans are made with lard.  (Again, his joke is something along the lines of he's not in the \"business of making healthy food...\" or he is in the process of doing it...)  Either way, it would be nice to have a veggie option."}
{"text":"Great food !  We eat here about once a week. My daughters are constantly asking for their chicken tacos ."}
{"text":"This place is located in a gas station.We got the steak breakfast burrito and it was delicious. Also the al pastor was great!The owner was friendly. Order to go."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The red and green salsa are fantastic. I recommend ordering online or ahead of time they can get busy sometimes. The staff here is pretty cool everyone takes pride in what they do. I would recommend to anyone to try it."}
{"text":"There are not enough stars to tell you how much we love Jefe's. The wife and I can't go a week without jonesing for some love from Ben. Can't say what my favorite is but the carnitas are great and their chicken anything re-defines what yard bird can taste like. Heard a person or two complain about the wait but there's a reason for that, and if you want food in a hurry try Taco Bell. You will not find better SD style yummies anywhere in town. Now go...get you some Jefe's."}
{"text":"Here's my issue with people! Why not read to understand instead of reading to reply and be defensive when you need to correct what's wrong! The message below from the owner is what's wrong with this place! First, why send me a private message...just put the darn message or whatever you have to say on my review and keep it moving. Secondly, I finally figured out the problem here. His goal is be like Chipotle and continue to whitewash and insult Mexican food. CHIPOTLE ISN'T REAL MEXICAN FOOD!!!! It's a cold, fake COPYCAT!!! He's actually delusional enough to think I was trying to hurt his business instead of taking a customer complaint and FIX his ways! Did I insult your food, NO I insulted how you run your business! BUT DID I LIE? Absolutely NOT! I want you to be successful that is why I left a intelligent truthful review! STOP using your employees as an excuse for your bad practices! And you just started closing on Sunday's and Monday's so don't act like it's been a practice since you opened! And if your goal is to be Chipotle then why is your food higher than theirs? And my TANTRUM as you rudely stated was that you weren't open to serve my daughter and her 10 friends because I been stopped eating your food! You need to grow up! You're running a business but your EGO is running you! I feel like I am talking to a two year old child who can't comprehend basic CUSTOMER SERVICE! And please don't tell me about future trends in the restaurant industry because I am highly qualified in that area! Your reason for having folks pay first is so when you make them wait an hour for FAST FOOD, you already got paid so who cares if they leave! You went into too much personal detail which is what you do when folks come to your place of business! You need to stop it! I am not the only person who has said this to you but you're tone death! Your only response to a concerned customer should've been \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience and I am also sorry for charging more money but you still have to request food with your food! I am also sorry for the bitter red sauce on the enchiladas, and I am sorry for not keeping normal business hours like CHIPOTLE since my goal is to insult Mexican food, remove all the flavor and spice, and serve it cold like CHIPOTLE!\"   BEN THE OWNER: Mrs. Creole thanks for posting your review about Jefe's Taco Shop. Your 1 Star review has brought in so much business that we've been having trouble keeping up. I'm a little bit confused & also sadden about how you feel about us beginning to thrive. I saw that you were VERY irate about us closing for the Holiday weekend. Just about everyone of our regular guests knows that we're closed Sunday's, Monday's, holidays & holiday weekends. You have the right to be upset. We don't believe in & will NEVER open on Sunday's. Maybe in the near future we'll reopen on Mondays. Being closed on Tuesday July 5th was not planned. I had given our main cook the day off since he was going to California to visit his mother & I was to fill in for him. But all hell broke loose when my morning cashier had a family emergency & wasn't able to come in & will no longer be able to work with us anymore. We spent the entire holiday weekend moving closer to work from Henderson. Two 26' foot truck loads & we still didn't finish moving. So I was forced to shut it down on Tuesday.  Originally I was just an investor in the business & wasn't seeing any progress. After evaluating what our food cost was & the portions we give I had to adjust some pricing. We are in business to turn a profit & not slave our teammates like other places do. With  just about 200 5-star reviews on Yelp I believe I'm getting the hang of the restaurant business. I'm definitely not trying to \"reinvent the food wheel\" but perfecting it yes. I don't agree with you about Roberto's being a success. 50 years in business & they  have less than 100 locations I don't think so. I don't believe in having to break just about every labor law & paying minimum wages to turn a profit. Now Chipotle is another story, 23 years in business with 2,066 locations that's impressive. We have crawled, we have walked, & now we're beginning to run. Our online ordering is a game changer. Although you're not happy with having to prepay for your meal it's the future. The next time you visit Panera Bread, Mc Donald's, or Jack in the Box you will see self-help ordering kiosks.  I'm aware of some inconsistency in our food & have been working very hard to correct that. What troubles me Mrs. Creole is that you stated that the quality of our food has dropped drastically but then you threw a tantrum when we weren't open to serve you. If you're in the food service industry yourself please allow 15 minutes of your time & I will be delighted to listen on what you have to say.  Thanks again for posting your review & please accept my sincere apology for not being able to serve you on Tuesday July 5th. Your next meal is on me.  Sincerely,  Ben Robledo"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Ben gave us an exceptional customer service and most importantly the food is out of this world!!"}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews don't lie this place is great.  The food is very good and the service is great!  The owner really takes the time for great customer service.  Don't let the fact that it's in a gas station freak you out.  The kitchen is very clean and the food is fresh!"}
{"text":"Everything was overcooked. I'm gonna try ask if they can cook medium well next time I'll give them more stars."}
{"text":"Great customer service and AWSOME TACOSSS!!! I'm telling you guys now !!! I will be back for more lol"}
{"text":"My husband and I just went there today and it was hands down amazing. My husband got the El Jefe burrito and I ordered tacos and a mulita, it was all very delicious but what was mind blowing was the customer service. It was top notch service!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I lived right behind them in the sky pointe apartments for a few years and I would go a few days a week and every time it was a great experience! Staff always awesome and the food is great! I moved and haven't been there as often because of my location but I miss it! Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I had the carne asada torte and carnitas fries. They were both very good. The woman at the front counter was really friendly and super helpful. I would definitely go back and try more items off the menu."}
{"text":"First time and we were treated like stars haha. Owner is amazing and funny. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"LEGIT!!! yes it's in a gas station. Yes it's some of the best Mexican I've ever had...and I've had a lot. Just do it."}
{"text":"So I really wanted some carne asada tacos! I like robertos but wanted some street style tacos. So I turned to Yelp as I often do. I found Jefe's! I am so glad I did. It is located in gas station which can be off putting to some, but get over it!! This is probably the best taco shop in Vegas. The kitchen is clean and the owners/staff are friendly and kind. I ordered the mini street tacos because I wanted to taste the meat without accoutrements. Many a bad taco has been hidden with toppings. Do I got three Carne Asada tacos, two chicken, and one al pastor taco. I also had my littles with me and got them a cheese quesadilla and fries. The Carne asada was cooked well, not dried out or overly chewy. The seasoning was the perfect amount of spice. The corn tortillas here are boss! Not overly salty like some places we've been. The chicken tacos were great too! The chicken was moist and similarly seasoned to the carne asada but not as spicy! The al pastor was amazing! It wasn't dried out, had great seasoning and the right amount of smoke/char flavor. The kids demolished the cheese quesadilla, fries, and horchata. Which in my house is amazing because they're some picky eaters. But honestly if you want a taco or anything else you see on the menu, give it a try, it'll be amazing!! Found my new taco stop."}
{"text":"Still amazing. And Ben is fantastic, as well as all the employees. Just the perfect place to get some food after a long day at work."}
{"text":"Bomb as hell and the guy is real cool. I would cum here again many times over. Hooray."}
{"text":"The tacos were little dry and the experience was nice , nice staff and all but am sure there's other places that I can get a better taco from sorry ,"}
{"text":"I've been low carbing and been dying for Mexican food. I've read all about Jefe's and have been dying to check it out. This place does not disappoint! Ben was so nice and accommodating to my picky order. I got a delicious fajita salad custom made and there's meat baby! Plenty of it and it was super fresh and delicious! My husband got the beef chimichanga and loved it. It was YUGE! Thanks for the amazing food and customer service Ben!! We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Excellent Taco's here, my first visit was yesterday and the first bite into a Carne Asada Taco brought me back to the 80's and Paramount,Ca. during the era and heyday of the Taco Trucks in and around Los Angeles. The best ones were in Paramount, Ca. very close to Compton, Ca. IMHO. I'll be back to try the rest of their menu, as of this writing I can highly recommend their Carne Asada and Al Pastor Tacos. The quality of their meat sets them apart from the other local Taco Shops.Their Hot Salsa is also top shelf in taste and heat. The owner \"Ben\" is highly personable and a great guy to talk to with great customer service, he's not too bad for a PENDEJO. ;-)) These guys are from San Diego where the quality of Taco Shops are outstanding and comparable to Los Angeles's finest. (Their entire menu is recommended, as of this update, two months later, I've eaten just about everything on the menu with zero disappointment.)"}
{"text":"Their food is delicious and decent priced! Close to where we live which is a major plus! We got the asada nachos which were huge, California burrito which was huge as well,  and asada mini tacos all were very good! The sauces were good as as well. Way better than all the other mexican places around. I just wish they had the carrots!"}
{"text":"Two days in a row for Mexican food! Not a bad thing at all. Picked the husband up at work for what I thought was going to be a quick lunchdate before I drop the boss man off. Quick was not the word.  It wasn't hard to find this place at all. I mean, gas station....there's only two in the vicinity, in which one of them bare the Jefe taco sign. We walk in to the smell of food being cooked. Shark bait.  We stand in line and it appeared to be pretty busy. People were waiting, people were in line to order,  pretty promising. It was our luck we were standing behind a couple of dudes who were ordering way too on the nitpicky side. The kind where you stand there waiting, and you can't help but to utter mutherbloopbloop in your head. The fellas themselves said, we're probably the annoying guys who annoy the people behind us, blahblah. Something to that extent. They were right about that. Okay, okay, this is going to turn into a rant.  We FINALLY get to order. The cashier informs us, unfortunately, their head cook is in the hospital so there's going to be a bit of a wait. Life happens so no problem. I think I wasn't anticipating the \"bit of a wait\" thoroughly. Oh before I forget, she did ask us how did we hear of them, have we been there before, and if I wanted to be entered into their system. If you choose to do so, you get a free meal on your birthday. Awesome!  When you check-in you get a free drink offer in which I took advantage of. We opted for horchata. Alls we ordered was 3 mini Carne asada tacos, 3 mini lengua tacos, and a side order of plain ole french fries. Our total was 15 bucks even.   Anyway, it's always my luck to head somewhere new with some kind of incident. Their head cook is in the hospital so their marketing guy became head cook.  Honestly, you could clearly tell it wasn't his thang because the bit of a wait was definitely a bit of a wait. It took about 40-45 mins until we received our mini tacos and fries. We waited a little longer because I overheard the cashier and cook tell the guys before us he had to redo their food as he was not satisfied with the way it turned out.    Luckily, I'm patient. The husband on a lunchbreak with the 2 babies, not so much. Glad I sent him to the truck 15 mins into the waiting. And no wonder why the girls who were sitting at the table when we walked in had the most broke faces ever.   Anyway, the last 10mins of waiting, the cook came out to apologize and explain why it was taking longer than usual. I appreciated the communication rather than being ignored because it gives you a boost of hope.....the hope that your food will soon be done. The quicker I said okay, thank you, then the quicker he can get back into the kitchen to finish up his line.  There are items on their menu that are on the pricey end considering it's a hole in the wall type of joint. Tacos were within reason as well.   We finally got our food. Sadly, we had to jet the husband back to work. He ate in his office, while I ate in his parking lot because the babies had fell asleep on the ride back so it wasn't like I could sit in the office with him to eat. So fries went to waste because the fries were for the minions. Was not in a french fry mood, the horror...I know.   Because we waited so long for just 6 mini tacos and fries...I couldn't appreciate the hype about this place. While I will admit their Carne asada meat is clearly of a higher grade and properly seasoned...I just don't forsee myself driving back anytime soon. Note, anytime soon. My husband, upset, was even more upset to find his lengua tacos weren't lengua. He got shredded meat instead. He just didn't tell me which shredded meat it was. Needless to say, he was even more furious.  I'm such a huge taco fan, I do think they were good, but  again...the wait just didn't allow me to see what the hype was. Plus, while I waited...there were a bunch of obnoxious people entering the gas station acting like they're all drugged up or something. Not a big fan of such a vibe. So you have to kind of see from my experience how much of a fail it turned out to be. I'm gonna need a moment to recover.   Hopefully, the headcook recovers from whatever he is experiencing. It's always sad to hear of anyone having to be in the hospital. Life happens and sometimes businesses get shaken up beyond their control so I'm not blaming anyone of such. It was just my luck of bad timing in wanting to try somewhere new.  But despite the wait, I certainly would boost someone to give them a try. Whenever I do decide to return, hopefully, I can give a better rating. So for now, the 3 stars is the best I can give because I honestly didn't get to experience what everyone else who reviewed experienced.  *Because it is in a gas station and does not have adequate seating, I don't think the location/environment is kid friendly. I would even save the hassle of unfolding a stroller."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of taco shops in Las Vegas and California, and Jefe's tacos are by far my favorite. The Al Pastor tacos are some of the best taco's I've ever had. My wife and I have been here about 10 times and we've tried everything. Everything is superb. Taken 3 other groups of friends and they all agree they are tasty tacos."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place, thanks yelpers! Definitely worth checking out, just don't go at lunchtime because it's super busy with nearby business people. Stop in earlier in the day or for late lunch or dinner. The staff is super friendly and they have lots of deals. Their tech is on point, you can put just your name in their system and get a freebie for your birthday. If you download their app, you can order ahead, access secret menu items, ultra customize your order and get other deals. Plus, the food is def on point! I've only had the carne tacos and tacos al pastor but both were fantastic. Their green sauce is top notch and you can't go wrong with the horchata or Jamaica. Plus, since it's inside a gas station there's every kind of drink or snack you could want with it. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Great price, great people, but just okay on taste.   I would normally give this a lower score but the people are really great and the price you pay is so cheap that it's such a good deal.  You get what you pay for. For what you pay here you definitely get a good amount of food."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I checked Yelp today! I was browsing around Yelp for something to eat in the neighborhood to see what I was feeling. Well if you know me, I am always down for Mexican and when I saw this new name I had to check it out! Very glad I did. The girl was sweet and asked me if I was interested in becoming a regular. All they needed was my name. I gave her my name and she right away started addressing me accordingly (no impersonal ma'am or miss, but by my first name). She asked how I found out about their place and let me know that they are all about customer service - which I could absolutely tell. The food was super on point too!!  I ordered adobada fries which comes in two sizes super size =$9 and their bigger one = $12. It was flavorful, the meat was delicious, and it had A LOT of it as well as fries! Not too much beans too which I liked.   Anyways, definitely recommend anyone to try it! It's located inside the Sinclair gas station, so it might be easy to miss."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and let me tell you very impressed! As soon as I came in customer service was great! The cashier immediately greeted me, she asked if I've eaten there before I explained to her it was my first time and she helped me look over the menu and decide on the steak nachos which were sooo good! Even while being prepared it smelled sooo good. They even offer a free meal on your birthday, which mine is around the corner! Definitely will be taking advantage!!"}
{"text":"Go to for great taco fix.  Al Pastor is always a must, great flavor and a little char, topped with onion and cilantro.  The staff is amazing and very friendly.  There is no substitute in town."}
{"text":"Loved the online order feature! It's very convenient knowing when your food will be ready, especially if you're pressing for time. Their customer service was pretty good even when they were busy with orders. Food was just as delicious! That won't be my last visit."}
{"text":"Super friendly people with amazing food.  I had the mega carna asada fries and they were big enough to feed 4 people.  The was owner was nice as can be and I will definitely be back before I leave town."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing... Great prices, great food, and great customer service. The food was greatly priced and tasted amazing. I just moved here from Florida and this is my new mexican food spot!!! P.S- it's in a gas station but don't let that fool you into missing out."}
{"text":"I found Jefe' s by searching best burrito in Las Vegas to which I found they are that and so much more. The food is amazing and filling, and they take great pride in their food as they present their masterpiece to you. And Ben is always friendly and makes you feel welcome every time you walk in. I'm happy to be a customer and I'll be sure to bring more people to Jefe' s."}
{"text":"Food: carne asade mini street tacos. I ordered 3 at $2.50 each. These were REALLY good. The tortillas were hot and fresh tasting. The meat was nicely marinated and of good quality. Served with plenty of onion and cilantro. They offered red or green salsa on the side and I had the green.   Location: inside a gas station so that is the really unfortunate and gross part. There are 3 tables with about 8 chairs. It's near the smelly bathroom. I got over it because the tacos were so good. Plus gas stations freak me out because all I can think about is it getting robbed so I can't relax.   Service: the guy at the counter was really nice but it took forever to make our food.   This place is really far for me in NLV and we only went there because we had to go to a car dealership near there. :("}
{"text":"I've lived on Ann Rd for 17 yr and never heard of this place but the reviews were so good thought I'd check it out. Was convenient to order online before I left work and pick it up when I got off the freeway. People should be clear on their reviews though that it is located in the SINCLAIR gas station not the shell which is across the street. I couldn't find them and even went into the shell who said the taco shop is behind them. Well there apparently WAS a taco shop there but they went out of business. The place looked just like they left an hour ago and there wasn't a sign indicating the business name so I thought Jefes closed early or went out of business and I went home, a reasonable mistake under the circumstances.   A few minutes after I get home my phone rings. Guess who? Right, it's Jefes. They have my taco! I quickly realize the mistake but tell him I'm home now, tired from working all week and I'm not going back out. To my surprise he says \"you should have called\". Well I thought you were closed down and didn't think to look up your number... Because you were closed in my mind. Then he says \"well you got an email with all our info when you ordered\" and finally \"I'll delete you from the system then\". I'm thinking \"this is how you talk to new customers?\"  If it were me I'd say \"it's ok man, we'll catch you next time\". I realize he was probably upset that he lost product but it was one single torta and I'm sure this isn't the first time someone couldn't find them. Don't they value a new customer more than a single torta? If they are going to operate out of a gas station they should probably expect to lose a little business due to their location. Plus their yelp profile and even on their website they don't make it clear they are located in the Sinclair station not the shell. If it were me I would make it abundantly clear which gas station they are located in just to minimize the customers they might lose due to being hard to find. Im sure the food is good but due to the bad attitude I won't be trying them again. I haven't missed this place for 17 yr so I don't think I will going forward either.    Jefes also aren't clear on their website they are located in the Sinclair. Due to the difficulties finding them, I would suggest they make it abundantly clear on their website and Yelp where they are. They surely don't want people turning away because they can't find them."}
{"text":"This place is soo good, since moving to vegas we haven't found good mexican food until we went to Jefe's...Food is bomb and the green salsa was soooo good wish we could have ordered some to go :) definitely dont judge a book buy its cover, walk inside you wont regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Great staff that goes above and beyond to make sure you are happy. Ben makes sure you are happy and content with the service you receive. Love the fact that Ben actually sat down and made you feel more than just a customer. Throughout our whole meal he talked to us and got to know us. Went above and beyond my standards!"}
{"text":"We are originally from Southern California so our standard for Mexican food can be pretty high and a little picky.  We are always looking for something yummy in our area.   At first I was a little apprehensive based on the location, but we love trying different places. Man was it worth it!   The owner is hilarious and nice! We come back time and time again because of the service he gives us. The food is always top quality.   The food is not fast food. If you are on a time limit, order online. He now has online ordering which makes it easy to order from home, and get there when it is ready. That being said, we don't mind going and waiting 25 min for our food or however long it takes, because waiting for quality food it totally worth it.   One time my fiance ordered a combo burrito, and the person working basically said the person coming in at 6 makes it better, and he is better off waiting until 6, or next time and getting something else. That honestly won us over! He recommended something else, and said next time it's on him if he doesn't have the ingredients or something to accommodate us.   When we want a good burrito, we go here, every time. Hands down."}
{"text":"Random joint in a gas station with a cool dude named Ben bringing that SD Mexican food legitness to Vegas. Awesome customer service to go along with some proper grub. Try the al pastor fries if you need to switch it up from the usual carne asada you won't regret it"}
{"text":"You think gas station food and you automatically think gross. So think about how good the food must be for hundreds of people to rate this 5 stars. I ordered a AL pastor burrito, and got like 2 pounds of yum pork bliss. Wife ordered Carne asada fries, and they were heavenly as well. None of that garbage meat Robertos and such serve, all high quality meat here. Definitely some of the best mexican food around. If you got food of this quality at a nice seated restaurant, you'd have no qualms about paying twice as much."}
{"text":"Props to this place to being able to have a ridiculous amount of business for being in a gas station. I've always seen online posts about it but never knew exactly where it was located.  We went specifically for street tacos and we were not disappointed! I guess the owners are from San Diego and have their little flair of cooking style. We each had a carne asada, al pastor, and chicken street tacos. At $2 a taco with a minimum of 3 for the order, it was a steal. The al pastor was soooo good! By far our favorite. The green sauce was so spicy and the red sauce was even spicier! Beware! My tongue was on fire but it was oh so good.  The horchata and the lemon beverages were both delicious. We waited a total of about 35 minutes on a Saturday evening to order and receive our food. Apparently they get a wicked amount of online orders because every time we heard a ding another order came in, and those dings came often! I will definitely come back here again and most likely try to order online to avoid the hassle of hanging out inside a gas station.   Don't let the location trip you up becuas2this place is amazing! Nice to have a good taco place on this side of town!"}
{"text":"This was unexpectedly by FAR the best customer experience I have ever had in any restaurant. Ben greeted us warmly and confident with"}
{"text":"I really don't want to rate this spot because I want to keep it all to myself, but then again the only reason I found it tucked in a Convenience store is because others took the time. I knew when I walked in it was a special place. Ben greeted me & immediately apologized for the wait. Then a personal introduction & a hand shake at a taco shop at a gas station? That's service. They had several large orders in front of me but I didn't mind the wait as I got to see great fun & fellowship with every customer that came in. My anticipation was building as I smelled the al pastor tacos all the way home. And they did not disappoint nor did the Burrito. This place is a gem & I'll be back. Maybe tomorrow!!!!"}
{"text":"so let's talk about this place for a minute.  first off, the owner....so incredibly sweet. he's such a nice guy and is so friendly with all of the customers and definitely tries to get to know them which I love. second best thing besides his super positive attitude is the food. it's not insanely priced and you get incredible quality."}
{"text":"Came looking specifically for SoCal's famous California burrito. Drawn in by the only 5 star rated taco joint. Was easy enough to find in the dark. In the sinclairs gas station mart.  Ben was very inviting.  Informed me of the birthday meal, which I'll come back for. And I think I overheard something about an anniversary meal too.  Ok. On to the food. California burrito on point.  Warning: red sauce is hot. Green sauce mild.  Will definitely be back to try other item on the menu.  Keep up the good work guys! For those who left the few under 4 star reviews, thanks for trying, but won't stop me from coming back, plus there are at least 200 more 5 star reviews that will have any new comer over looking your criticisms.  Came back.  Another cali burrito. This time though, I bought some chicharonnes and had them put it into my burrito. My favorite burrito, customized? Deserve a five star rating.   Ben told me of a customer that gave a 1 star for not being able to do a call in order... you rate a restaurant on the food, not on how you don't get you way. You want your way you can go to Burger King."}
{"text":"What a great experience! I'm pretty sure it was the owner I met, He was very interactive with his customers and was nice enough to comp me on a free drink on my first visit.  The food itself was amazing!  It's in the gas station but don't let that deter you."}
{"text":"This place was not what I was expecting but the food was awesome! And the people working there were super nice and great to talk to. Will defiantly be going back for more tacos."}
{"text":"2nd time here... But my first checkin. We ordered online, and had to wait awhile. We left our house about 10mins after ordered... 5 min drive to Jefe's. Food is fantastic and so is the customer service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The people running the  show were really warm and welcoming. My lady and i both got California burritos and 3 al pastor tacos. Again super friendly and for being first timers they hooked us up with some drinks! 5 stars all day!! Make sure to tip they definitely deserve it!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in the north-west area of the Las Vegas Valley. period. This is authentic Southern California flavor; you cannot go wrong with this place if you enjoy, and miss, that so-cal taco truck familiarity.   On my first visit, the owner was behind the register and was he incredibly friendly, approachable, genuinely interested in providing nothing short of excellent service.  He took the time to explain how he got started, where he gets his ingredients, and how he developed his passion for making the best tacos. He is so proud of the food he serves that he will refund you your entire purchase if you are not satisfied one bit.   Yes, it's in a gas station. So what?  The best food often comes from the most unexpected places - ever watched an Anthony Bourdain TV show?  A restaurant need not be highly polished, white shirt, black-tie, affair to provide superb service and exemplary food.  Do you want deliscious tacos? Go here."}
{"text":"It took us over 2 years and moving again to find great Mexican food in Vegas!   This place is the bomb!   Very authentic!  It's a small family owned biz inside a gas station!   That was a little off putting at first but having ready so many great reviews we decided to check it out.  And we eat here on the regular!    Def recommend !"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service, I only recommend ordering in advance to reduce the wait time."}
{"text":"alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Don't let the gas station fool you this place has some of the best tacos in town!! Sometimes there's a wait but it's worth it. Everything is good here. My go to is the Mini street tacos there to . This place is a must try if you like tacos and good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"For those who don't speak Spanish, El Jefe means the boss. And it takes cojones to claim you're the boss, especially when you're located inside a gas station. This place also had me cautious before coming because gas station food pretty high on the list of things I don't trust, right behind Donald Trump's hairdresser.  I was also annoyed when I looked on the menu and saw it would be $7 for a breakfast burrito because I'm also a believer that fast food should be cheap. However it all changed when the burrito came out. It was basically the size of my forearm. But we all know size doesn't matter and it's the taste of the burrito and it was might tasty. I've been back several times and everything was good. Chicken and beef breakfast burritos were on point. I've had a chorizo burrito and tacos. Literally everything I've had is delicious, especially with the green sauce. Long story short, you're going to want to check this out. They called themselves the boss and they certainly are living up to it. High fives all around  P.S. They're super cool here and my first time they gave me a free drink. They have All the agua frescas and my favorite is Jamaica or a Jamiaca/ Limon combo. I also found out they do the drinks free with a yelp check in as of 4/16/16."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and absolutely love this place. It's the best Mexican food I've had in such a very long time. It's family owned, and they are all very personable with their customers. They take the time to spark conversation with you while your order is being prepared--and let me just say their ingredients is so fresh! Their guacamole is my favorite as well as their Horchata. My go to dish is the Carne Asada Fries with Angus beef or their Chicken Chimichangas. You honestly can't go wrong with this establishment. I could eat here everyday. And if you have a birthday coming up, the food is on them! I always forget to go in and take advantage but I don't mind paying even if it's the day after. You want to spend a dime for great food, this is your place"}
{"text":"This is a family run place run out of a gas station. My family and I have been their twice and both times it was all great. The food is not just thrown together but made with Love. The family who runs the place are so nice and really take a lot of pride in their food. A+"}
