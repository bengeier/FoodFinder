{"text":"The filet mignon, \"Pittsburgh rare\" style is very good! My order of \"rare steak\" was actually rare, and the waitress had a cool history behind the meaning of \"Pittsburgh rare\" cooking."}

{"text":"Walking in I was very apprehensive after having tried the Pittsburgh Steak Company.  I have had some really bad experiences with steak.  I sucked it up, though, and pushed through to the hostess stand.  The interior had a fairly rugged look about it with exposed wooden beams and rock facades on the walls.  There was a bar that was offset from the rest of the dining area as well as some private dining rooms for larger parties -- smoking allowed in the bar.  

We were sat in one of the dining areas and given our menus.  Not a lot of items on the menu, but that was fine since I already knew that I wanted a steak.  I was craving steak -- GOOD steak.  What made the situation better for me was the fact that they had prime rib.  This made me happy to no end.  While I was looking over the menu trying to decide on which side we wanted our server brought bread, butter and oil and we ordered our soups: Lobster bisque and French onion.

I too a quick sniff of the oil and it didn't smell bad.  I tasted some on the bread.  It was really nothing special, just a light olive oil with not much flavor; but after all of the poor meals served with bad and rancid oil, I was quite content to enjoy this olive oil.  We finally settled on our side and we ordered the 16oz medium-rare prime rib with french fries.  

Our soups arrived rather quickly and while I tasted the bisque, I looked around at the decor.  In addition to the rustication that is present, there is wallpaper that has been installed with a melee of different sports figures.  Not being a sports buff, I can't tell you the names that went with the caricatures, but they were still interesting to look at. 

The bisque was quite rich and I could taste the lobster, butter, sherry, and cream.  The ratios were good and I enjoyed the flavor composition.  While eating the bisque, I snuck a sampling of the French Onion soup and was amazed at the flavor.  The onions had actually been cooked to the point of tenderness.  They were bathed in a broth of stock and wine with some tasty cheese and croutons baked into the top.  I have to say, as good as the bisque was I will be returning for the French Onion.

As we finished our soups, our entree arrived to the table with an extra plate -- no need for us to ask.  I went for the french fries -- oh so good.  They were freshly made and fried perfectly.  I then went for the prime rib and carved it up between the two of us.  It was cooked more toward a medium than a medium-rare, but the flavor was spectacular.  I have not had a good prime rib like this in a while.    

Throughout the entire meal, our service was impeccable.  Only once did I wonder where our server went.  When she reappeared with our soups she apologized for the wait.  She said that the kitchen had burnt the French Onion slightly and she had had them make it over.  I am usually skeptical about excuses, but I had actually heard some of the other servers talking about how she had made the kitchen remake the soup.  Elaborate hoax or the truth, I don't know.  I do know that I enjoyed the food and the service to the point that I know I will return."}
{"text":"I visited here a couple weeks ago after a day spent at the OTB losing many dollars on the pony's after the Kentucky Derby.  I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to get a table for 10 with just a couple hours notice on a Saturday night.  It's located where the Red Bull Inn used to be on your way to the airport.  The space is pleasant enough.  It's very large with a good sized bar and a few leather couches and chairs scattered about.  The wine selection was not too great for being a steakhouse.  The wine is not even listed on their website.  I was able to find a few selections that were priced okay I guess.  I think they were probably 2x to 3x cost.  As an aside, the Carlton downtown only prices their wine about $10 or so above cost.  We were seated promptly at a nice enough table in the middle of the dining room.  There wasn't too much privacy at this table, but seats are spread out enough that I didn't feel that I could here others conversation.  The waitress was nice enough and seemed like a pro.  We got our wine and drinks promptly and were served a nice selection of warm bread and house butter.  I really like to try the Lobster Bisque when I eat at steakhouses, but to my disappointment and surprise they didn't offer lobster bisque.  Mortons, Capital Grille, and the like all offer this soup.  The one thing I will mention about their decor is that they have caricatures of Pittsburgh \"celebrities\" on the wall.  I thought that was a bit tacky.  I ordered the filet tartare as an appetizer.  It was served with capers and chopped egg and a nice selection of hard bread.  I was very pleased with this appetizer.  The steak was perfect and the capers and gherkins were a nice addition to the tartare.  A friend of mine ordered the ahi tuna stack and it was very nice as well.  A good amount of what appeared to  be sushi grade tuna with a nice soy sauce and a good amount of avocado.  The entrees' come with sides, which lessens the bill a bit instead of just a straight a la carte, but I still think this place is a bit overpriced for what it is.  It's not as expensive as some of the city's most noteworthy steak places, but  it's close.  And, the experience is not on par with some of the other joints in town.  The sides were forgettable.  I mean I literally forget what they were, so they couldn't have been that good.  I ordered the lamb chops and they were totally overcooked. I think I asked for medium and they were closer to well done.  I pointed it out to the waitress who agreed, but I decided not to return it.  Another friend ordered a strip steak medium rare and it was well done.  Now, he's a chef and not so forgiving so he returned it.  Then after 20 minutes when most of us were well into our meals they brought him another one and it was overcooked as well.  He chose to eat it, because we didn't feel like waiting around again.  This really kind of messed up the whole experience, I mean it probably wouldn't have got four stars anyway, but to overcook our entrees' multiple times when you bill yourself as a steakhouse is a big deal.  I sampled another friends' filet and it was cooked properly.  I think we skipped dessert.  I'll try this place one more time.  They have a selection of game that seems interesting.  However, it appears to me to some degree they still need some work before I would frequent."}
