{"text":"Visited on a recent Thursday night. The food was great! Can't say enough about how good their cheese curds are! Drink options are good too --- preferred the mojito- yum!! Will definitely be back - great food and good vibe. Kid friendly too .. Saw lots of people come in with their kids."}
{"text":"I really like this place...funky atmosphere, feels like it's in a much bigger city. The menu is a wonderful combination of comfort food and newer flavors, but doesn't take itself too seriously. Still, from the things we tried and the other stuff whizzing by our table, it's all beautifully executed. And the commitment to locally sourced ingredients should keep things interesting.

Our hand-crafted mojitos were excellent -- not too sweet, nicely muddled, perfect flavor. Our appetizer, French Onion Dip, was yummy, too.

The Phorench Dip was fantastic. I wasn't expecting the zing this thing delivers, but it was great.  

Service was a little plastic-y, but very good. Absolutely no issues there. It's also awesome that they take reservations.

In all, a great place, especially in Stoughton. We'll be back and continue to recommend it."}
{"text":"To be blunt, not a good experience.  We went here to check out the \"urban\" locavore restaurant Stoughton offered as a big city restaurant with a small town identity.  I won't buy that it's their version of a local foodie place, but if they advertised as an pub food art bar, sure, I'd buy into that concept.  The less-is-more aesthetics (menu, decoration, website, etc.), fails as it comes across as lazy decorating.  The walls are adorned with outside art (nicer than the place), some garage sale farm/hunter adornments and typical country farm tables and chairs.  

We arrived about 8:15 on a Friday and were told there would be about a 15 minute wait.  We took 3 steps to the bar and ordered drinks and paid cash.  Then we ordered a Snack Plate to tide us over and told the bartender to add it to our bill.  The Apple Old Fashioned was too sweet to actually finish, but the snack plate was good and enough for 4 people.  The hostess got us within 15 minutes and we grabbed our snack plate and drinks to the table.

The hostess said our server would be right with us... and we sat for about 20 minutes before we asked a server to track down our server, whoever that would be.  During this time, we finished the snack plate, read our menus, kept looking at the servers passing us, stared at the server serving the table next to us and even talking about how we haven't seen a server while the person was serving the table 18 inches from us!  It seems that table had a food delay and drink mistake.  After flagging someone down, all the servers seemed to disappear and it took 5 minutes, no joke, before an apologetic server greeted us.  EVERY WORKER that passed our table, which was in the main aisle to the kitchen, screwed up by not asking us if we were taken care of.

Once we ordered (almost 9pm), the timing of the food was a bit longer than average: appetizer came within 15 minutes (really? The place was clearing out not getting busier.). The entrees came about 20 minutes after that.  I had the Pickled & Fried appetizer and it was tangy and fried well, but still too oily.  The Sea Bream Piccata was very salty and not reminiscent of piccata.  Luckily the fish was on top and decent, and not subject to the salty, stiff rice pilaf on the bottom.  The \"roasted red peppers\" tasted similar to the pickled ones I had fried, or possibly they were preserved/canned.  The Chicken & \"Dumplings\" was more like a Salty Poultry Seasoning Stew with shredded chicken in a thick, goopy sauce with gnocchi as the \"dumplings.\"  The parmesan gnocchi added to the saltiness.

Our server was good once we had one.  She checked in on us and her timing was good and was not overly-apologetic, which could be annoying in itself.  She certainly was at the mercy of the kitchen for our food timing.  Our bill was missing the snack plate and when we pointed this out she didn't offer a discount for the wait or made an exception, she thanked us and added it.  That was fine and why we pointed it out, we don't steal based on a mistake, it's someone's income missing when it's not accounted for.  However, in this case a discount would have been appropriate - the table next to us got free drinks for a mistake.  Our bill was closed right before 10pm, we were there an hour and 45 minutes. The art in the place garnered the 1 star.

The food was memorable in terms of how over flavored and salty everything was.  This is the place to go if you have burned out your taste buds with a highly salted, highly seasoned diet rich in frying oil.  I couldn't tell if the food products are so bad they need to be over seasoned, or if the chefs lack ability to balance the actual food to seasoning by drowning the food in salt and seasonings?  Service was bad, maybe due to a bad night, miscommunication, etc., but who cares when your one chance to make an impression is every customer you have.  Overall, we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome as are the owners!  I have had every item on the menu and all were amazing.  Glad to see they have added some new selections.  This place actually uses locally sourced foods not like a restaurant in Oregon that claims to but doesn't. They are very fairly priced and quality matches any of the top restaurants in Madison.  The decor is very nice with cool artwork. One of my all time favorites."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Great vibe, delicious cocktails, amazing food, and friendly service. I went with a big group of friends, and everyone absolutely loved the restaurant itself and the food/drinks they ordered. 

We started with the poutine, which was drenched in gravy without being soggy, and covered with slightly melty cheese curds and brisket. Delicious. I had the gingered mojito (yum) and the Wendi melt with sweet potato fries. The meat was tender, flavorful, and paired very well with gruyere cheese. My husband ordered the boozy Thai iced coffee (tasted a little more like a White Russian than a true Thai iced tea, but tasty nonetheless) and the cannibal burger--again, very flavorful meat and just different enough from a regular burger to be quite memorable. 

But this place isn't just about meat--one of my friends ordered the beet and pickled melon salad and loved it, and I must say it looked beautiful. The menu appears to have a handful of good choices for vegetarians. Vegans have fewer options, it seems, as many of the items include cheese--though their menu does state that they are willing to modify or make substitutions to accommodate different dietary preferences.   

The decor was notable, too--big original paintings on paper of American animals from owls to buffalo. Not sure if this is permanent or if they'll be displaying other original art from time to time. 

I'm really excited to have a place like this in Stoughton, and I'm definitely planning to go back again! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great space with even better food and good beer on tap. Friendly waitstaff with casual vibe. Locally sourced ingredients claimed (hope that's true). We will definitely return next time in Stooooooton."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely AMAZING. The fried cheese curds were the best I've ever had in my entire life, and the portion size was a meal in and of itself. They were absolutely delicious, I still think about them! For my entree, I had the Tomato Po' Boy sandwich with Green Bean Casserole on the side, and it was breathtaking! The crunch of the fried tomato, the texture of the crispy grilled bread and lettuce, the taste of the sauce and mushrooms, it was just a work of art in my opinion. The casserole was so good, too - the green beans, I prefer them slightly crunchy, but that's personal preference I suppose - the creamy sauce they were in was really good and I love that they topped it with fried onions. 

The staff was nice and pleasant, if not completely attentive regarding our water glasses, but I'm not fussy. We just waved her over and asked for more water, problem solved. The amazing service provided to our stomachs proved to make us more than happy, and we left very content and looking forward to our next trip to Wendigo in the future! 

On a side note, the decor and the layout was very interesting and pretty, and their drinks are really good, too! We tried the Cucumber one and the Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"This is where my partner and I go on a \"treat yo'self\" night. That moment could be a crappy day, or spur of the moment, or just because we like to surprise each other. It's absolutely worth the drive - whatever the reason we come, we always feel like we had a really special meal and a great time. The cocktail list is perfect. We always enjoy whatever we're eating. And that from-scratch green bean casserole?! Um, yes. We've had great service and can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"We had the poutine with both the brisket & the mushrooms & it was very good.  They have such an interesting menu and cool atmosphere.  Can't wait to try other items on the menu!  Orchard Old Fashioned was just OK.  Next time I'd try the Gingered Mojito....  Service was a bit slow for 7:30pm on a Tuesday..."}
{"text":"This is the only decent place to go in Stoughton as far as good honest and talented people and great food and service. Thank you Wendigo for giving Stoughton a humane and top notch establishment!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast when our normal place was packed. The restaurant has a nice modern feel to it, very similar to places you'd find downtown in Madison. It was surprisingly empty for the day and time though, there was only one other couple when we arrived. The restaurant is slightly expensive, but portions are good. We came in at 11am and ended up being limited to the brunch menu, which was disappointing as I had a specific taste for something, but was pleasantly surprised with my choice. My wife loved her meal as well. Our only real complaint was the waitress was inattentive and we had to go to the bar and ask for our check because we'd been waiting about 15 minutes for it after finishing. She mentioned being \"lost\" in her phone but was apologetic and quick to bill us out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the Madison area. Seriously, so good.  I live in Madison but I gladly make the trip to Stoughton.  After you try the Phorench Dip, you'll understand.  The whole world will make sense.  It's kind of like eating psychedelic mushrooms for the first time (mind blowing).  The cheese curds are hand-battered and come with an excellent siracha aioli.  The sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had.  What else do you need to hear?"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place last night w/ the in-laws.  

It was AWESOME!!  The mixed cocktails were unique and delicious.  I had the watermelon one (super awesome)!!

We decided to try a selection of appetizers because there were so many we wanted to try.

Meat platter = awesome and huge (could have used more bread tho)

Fried Cheese Curds = AMAZING (especially w/ the homemade ranch dressing)

Mini Corn dogs = Yummy -- super soft and flakey breading. 

Shrimp and calamari fritters -- these were yummy but weren't my favorite on the menu.  Too much breading...it could also have been that was stuffed-full by the time we started at these. ha ha ha!

We also had this pickled beat salad which had large crumbles of fresh goat cheese.  It was so refreshing and delicious.  The goat cheese...yum!!

Last but not least -- we ended with the homemade apple crisp with this caramel sauce and ice cream....to...die...for.

This place was amazing and I woujdl highly recommend it.  We got...4 large appetizers -- a salad -- and dessert with 4 cocktails and our bill was about $80 -- for 4 people that isn't too bad!!!

Try this place...it's unique and you will love it!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Best cheese curds we've ever had. Great sauces. Burger is out of sight and massive. We split and only ate a quarter of it each. Excited for tomorrow's leftovers. Also tried the potato arugula salad - do it."}
{"text":"Had dinner there with my in-laws. The place is very nice but very warm (temperature) inside. As other have mentioned, the menu is small but the items they have, they do with great care.

My steak sandwich (Wendi Melt) was really good. My wife enjoyed her Fried Tomato Po' Boy. We all found the food to be great and plan to be back soon"}
{"text":"Huge potential for this Stoughton restaurant. Beautiful space, friendly staff, unique menu items. I'd recommend the elote and the Cannibal Burger."}
{"text":"Fantastic find. Take the back roads from Madison and you won't be disappointed. Great varied cross section of foods. Something for everybody....a must try is the green bean casserole side. Your Mom never came close to this stuff. Really cool atmosphere...almost feels like the West Village or something. Fantastic artwork, and great service as well. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Wendigo takes your every day food - burgers, club sandwiches, salads, etc - and gives them a twist. Every dish tastes like it was made with love. My favorites include the Clubhouse with sweet potato fries (oh my god, best sweet potato fries in the world) and the Strawberry Rhubarb salad. My husband and I try to make a point of going at least once a month, though ideally we'd go at least once a week. Did I mention they have brunch? Because oh my god the brunch... So. So. Good."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The one star is for the cheese curds, they were great. However, the rest of the meal was so poorly prepared we will not choose to dine here again.  I will look past the kitchen being backed up and the waitstaff flustered when we arrived at 7:30 -I get it, that can happen to any smaller-town restaurant. The big disappointment comes from the entrees. After an incredibly long table time wait we had hoped by the restaurant having almost completely cleared we would be served entrees true to the other reviews and wonderful appearing menu. Unfortunately, disappointment struck hard. The duck was tough, dry and impossible to eat, it supposedly came in a cherry-jalapeño sauce that had long since evaporated. We were unable to bite into, cut into or tear apart the duck. The skin was chewy and inedible.  The muscles and sausage were drenched in a burnt taste so pungent we could not salvage a decent meal from it. In what should have been a playful dish, the toppings of the pork jowl carnitas were dry and over salted while the tortillas were drenched in grease. We tried to tell our waitress but her fly-by approach did not allow us the ability. Not wanting to make a terrible scene since we could not tell her directly, we paid and left. Never to return."}
{"text":"The food is good. Very good. Portions are generous. My only complaint is that the seating is very close and doesn't allow for much conversation due to loudness and lack of privacy.  A larger location is warranted!"}
{"text":"Super cute space that includes a full bar and a stage for live music. There is what appears to be local art on the walls and a real attempt to offer local ingredients. We have friends in Stoughton (check out AmundArt Hus!) and heard good things about Wendigo. Our server was amazingly cool and funny and laid back. The place was packed at 5ish on a Saturday. Unfortunately, they allowed a group of bratty, loud kids to take over the stage. I guess good parenting escapes even small towns these days! That said, they ate quickly and left. The menu offers an interesting variety of mostly meat. Put another way, it's definitely not health food! I was hoping to have the trout tacos I had seen online but I guess those were seasonal. Since I don't eat meat, I wound up with the arugula and potato salad. It was very nicely seasoned and served just at the right temperature, not too cold and not too hot. I also got the sweet potato fries which are always nice to have as an option. In terms of drinks, we all just had beer, of which they have a large variety of local options. Not sure if they have desserts as we were not offered any. The rest of my group had burgers, a pork chili special, all of which they said were good. The prices are really reasonable but aside from a grilled cheese option and a couple pastas and salads, there really isn't much for a vegetarian or pescatarian to choose from. I know, I know, it's WI, but man can't live on cheese and meat alone!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This place wasn't what I expected in a bad way.  We arrived on a rainy Thursday night at 7 pm. We seated our selves and waited 10 min to get a staff's attention,  another 5 min for the menu and waters,  and probably another 10 min to have our orders taken. 

We got the burger $8 with a side salad and the Phorench Dip $9 with sweet potato fries. Seeing as how it was taking centuries to get any kind of service we opted to get the poutain with brisket appetizer $8,  hoping we'd have something to much on as we wait. 

The appetizer took another 30 min to come out. 

It was slightly disappointing. While the brisket had great flavor,  we received mostly fatty pieces. The fries weren't hot,  but warm to the touch. The gravy had an overbearing dill flavor and didn't really mesh with the curds.

The entrees thankfully arrived 5 min later. 

I appreciated the fresh spring green mix and the honey balsamic vinaigrette was a perfectly light pairing. The bread they use is superb. Flavorful, flaky outer but hardy enough to hold the sandwiches. 
The standard burger came with lettuce, tomato,  and raw white onions. The burger was the standout believe it or not. Very juicy and cooked perfectly. The Phorench was a pile of prime, sprout slaws, and jalapeno. While creative,  it falls short on flavor. It was just a mess really,  again the overwhelming dill flavor in the au jus ruined the sandwich. 

I would not rush to come back here again if at all. The service is what killed it for us."}
{"text":"The fried tomato sandwich is awesome. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly.  The staff is chatty and fun. This place is an asset to Main Street Stoughton. 

It does get busy at times. Unfortunately we never think of going to Wendigo during off peak hours and so we don't go as much as we'd like."}
{"text":"Beautiful gem, warm and inviting. Great salads. Generous portions, kind staff, solid cocktails."}
{"text":"This has easily become my second favorite restaurant in the Madison area and definitely worth the short drive to Stoughton. AMAZING food at VERY reasonable prices. I've always said my favorite cheese curds came from the Glarner Stube in New Glarus. That changed when eating at Wendigo! They are so gooey and everything you'd ever want from a cheese curd! The Butternut Squash & Apple Galette was also to die for! My boyfriend had the Chicken Paprikash and devoured the whole thing. I was obsessed with the poached egg on my Kale Caesar and would eat that salad every day if I could! We loved it so much when we went for dinner the next weekend we went for brunch which was just as amazing. I wish I could have tried more. I can't wait to go again and continue exploring the amazing menu."}
{"text":"Some friends and I stopped in for brunch on Sunday morning. The atmosphere is clean & modern. Lots of space, so no wait for a table. We were all pleased with our meals and the service. Limited menu, but enough options for any palate. I had the chocolate mandarin pancakes which were served warm maple syrup, eggs prepared your way and choice of fruit, greens, or potatoes. The pancakes were phenomenal! A very filling meal, all made to order, with fresh ingredients. Bloody Mary was also good, with a nice skewer of house made pickled veggies, cheese & sausage for garnish. A tad on the spicy side due to the horseradish for my liking, but still good! If you're looking for a quality meal and a place to catch up with friends, I certainly recommend this hidden gem of Stoughton!"}
{"text":"A great gem just outside of Madison. Incredible food, great service, hilarious bartender. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Take out the fact this restaurant is in Stoughton and just judge against any other place you have been before.  It will be in your top ten of all time.  Of course everybody likes different things, I mean the Red Lobster at East Towne is busy (ew.)  My most recent visit started with the Wisconsin Cheese Platter and it was so perfect I had to ask myself why I don't come here more often.  It is really not kid friendly, but for adults this is food at its finest.  I had a meatloaf that must have been a special (?) but it was comparable to the cheese platter.  Stupid good.  Service is friendly and folksy in a good way.  Great drinks that seem to always be changing or maybe evolving is a better to describe it.  If you get turned away here because of a long wait head down Page Street and go to Famous Yeti's Pizza (owned by the same folks I am told) and you will have the second best Pizza in the State of Wi (second only because of Wild Tomato in Fish Creek, but maybe Yeti is better, pizza is very personal thing).  Otherwise everything at Wendigo is excellent, some things better than others but all wonderful.  They do have a Friday Fish Fry that looks terrific, the folks next to us ordered it, so I have that to look forward to on my next visit."}
{"text":"I just moved in to town (Stoughton) this weekend and my grandmother, a resident at Skaalen and I decided to give Wendigo a go. My family order's pizza from Yeti's (same owners) when we would come visit and we were so impressed by their pies that I had a hunch this place was going to put out a nice menu. My grandmama and I shared a cheese plate and the Carnivore burger with sweet potato fries over an IPA and homemade lemonade. My grandmama is from the Deep South and has expectation when it comes to ice tea and lemonade and the lemonade surpassed her expectations. The cheese plate had a nice selection...I loved the goat cheese. It was served with a variety of nuts and fruits and was a nice portion size, better than Graze's. The burger was made of 4 different kinds of meat maybe? It was super tasty and the bun was perfect. The sweet potato fries were served with a spicy sauce. It was good but I'm more of a honey gal, myself.

The ambiance was inviting and I loved the original artwork. They have a nice stage which I look forward to seeing put to use. I am happy that I have a place in walking distance that meets my standard and that I can take friends and family to. This place is a wonderful addition to the community and I look forward to going back...probably tomorrow:)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Here's why:  
kind service
Amazing cocktails
Great food
Community minded owners
Hip atmosphere

This is not fast food. You might have to wait, but it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"We are happy to see another restaurant join the Stoughton lineup. Unfortunetly, it doesn't seem like they've hit their stride.  We waited 40 minutes to get a drink. We waited another 20 minutes to get a table. We then waited another 30 minutes with no one coming  to our table.  It was disappointing,  especially being right next to the hostess station. We have high hopes for them and wish them the best."}
{"text":"We went to Stoughton for vacation and visited Wendigo. The food was fantastic and so were the drinks."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight based on other reviews and it did not disappoint. 

My husband got the apple old fashioned, can't remember what it was called but he wasn't a huge fan, and he lives old fashioned. We got the cheese curds for an appetizer and they were really good, a nice light hand better and really, really cheesy melt in your mouth style. 

I had the Friday fish fry with sweet potatoes. The fish was good and a nice batter, not too heavy. The most surprising part was the coleslaw - it was amazing. I normally don't like coleslaw this this stuff was awesomely homemade. Not too vinegary, and it had apple slices in it. 

My hubby got the cannibal burger with mac and cheese. It was definitely a huge burger, a mouthful of meat in every bite. A different, but good burger. The mac and cheese wasn't knock your socks off, but definitely good."}
{"text":"Great place in Stoughton.  Although the menu changes, good standbys are the cannibal burger or wendi melt. You may be skeptical of the description of some things on the menu but trust me, you should try them.  Who would have thought that chickpea and radish tacos could taste so good?"}
{"text":"out standing cheese curds best I've had, phorench dip is great all tied together with good service and Fantasy Factory"}
{"text":"Back again in Stoughton. 

Kindly, they served us food late, as we saw a show at the Opera House. 

Still great craft cocktails, of good size, served efficiently. Perrrrrfect. 

Awesone menu. Great farm-to-table and as good as if not better than most places in nearby Madison. 

Thanks again, Wendigo!"}
{"text":"Great menu.  All locally grown produce. Drinks are one of a kind.  Price is reasonable. Been here a couple of times and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Con: Very slow service

Pros: Delicious locally grown food.  Drinks are yummy.  Servers are friendly."}
{"text":"Really good, laid back place.  Local food and beers are featured!  We started with the cheese curds (sooo good).  LIght and fluffy.  The cilantro pork tenderloin was really good.  Get the flourless molton chocolate cake.  Ammmmmazing."}
{"text":"Wendigo is becoming a personal favorite of mine every time my girlfriend and I visit her family in Madison. The food is incredible and always interesting, the drinks are fresh and tasty, and they make a pretty darn good fish fry!

I can't recommend Wendigo enough, it mixes upscale brewpub with small town eatery in a beautiful way!"}
{"text":"Wow, where to start? I happened to be in Stoughton for Wendigo's (public) opening day and I will certainly return just for another meal! I ordered the Carnivore burger because, well, my friend had already heard of it. So without really knowing what it was, I threw caution aside and ordered it. That burger was huge (and messy)! Apparently it had 4, maybe 5 different meats in that patty... Meat inside of meat! Not for the faint of heart! It's 4 hours later and I still can't think to eat anything else, still too full.

My friend let me try one of her sweet corn cobs (unfortunately I can't recall the menu name), but it had a (slightly spicy) sauce on it (sauce on corn, I never would have thought...) and it was delicious! Great as a lunch or appetizer!

The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Each one having tasted menu items, they were able to rave about our selections to get us even more excited. Even the bartender mentioned how he couldn't wait to have some of the food for dinner later. Another nice touch is that they bring water to every table and leave you with a large (and classy) bottle of water so you're never without! They also have a good alcohol selection (just saying).

Can't wait to go back, also interested to go back in a few months after word spreads of this great new addition to Stoughton! Definitely worth the drive from Madison."}
{"text":"Wendigo Has a nice feel with an eclectic menu. We started with cheese curds and then I had the Phorench Dip and my wife had a burger.  I am pretty critical ... The PD's baguette was great, the meat could have been leaner, the au jus had too much tarragon(?) and unable to separate the flavors on the sandwich (6 out of 10). My wife's burger had a great bun and altogether rated an 8 out 10. Waitstaff ... 10!"}
{"text":"I dont give out 5s everyday, but holy cow is this place awesome.  Best meal I've had near or in Madison in two years, totally worth checking out but be warned it fills up fast.  Very local focused, creative menu, great beer selection and not only local beer, plus a nice wine menu.  My wife had the triple vinegar pork and LOVED it.  My daughter had the Smoked Turkey Frisee Club, which is served with house smoked turkey and pork belly with a nice lemon aioli, along with a side of mac and cheese.  Didn't say a word through the whole sandwich.  I had, upon a couple of recommendations, the fried tomato po boy and it was, as promised, OUTSTANDING.  Had avocado, smoked mushrooms and a house made remoulade.  My wife had a Three Sheeps Stout, I had a Karben4 IPA, both were great.  Nice service, respecful of showtimes at the Opera House.  YUM."}
{"text":"So goood. The menu is small and pretty intimidating, because it sounds foreign, but just try ordering something and you won't regret it. My girlfriend and i were driving through wisconsin and needed a place to stop and get a good meal and maybe a beer. If we are ever within a 20 mile proximity, regardless of what madison has to offer, we will probably stop at wendigo. Their burgers are amazing, but tey have a culinary knowlegde  that is suprisingly unique to a small town. Don't be afraid to give them a shot."}
{"text":"In short, I'd give this place 6 stars if they'd let me. I live in San Francisco and enjoy the artificially low prices and great value provided by a restaurant community that's in sync with agriculture in its community. It's an absolute breath of fresh air to see the same phenomenon in my home town of Stoughton, Wisconsin. It's hard to imagine better quality at these prices. When you throw in the perfectly designed, warm interior it is simply the no. 1 choice in Southern Dane County. 

The bar is small and classy but staffed w/ great folks. I can't speak to the craft cocktails, but it is one of the better beer lists around; in Wisconsin that's saying something. 

My only criticism is that they don't serve breakfast. Stoughton doesn't have a quality breakfast place within 10 miles of it, and I know Wendigo would knock it out of the park."}
{"text":"Read about this place in the Cap Times, and decided to go there with my two roommates. We were doubtful that it would be worth traveling all the way to Stoughton for, seeing that Madison has so many great restaurants. So we jumped in the car and drove to Stoughton, which has a lovely downtown. Gotta say we were all a little disappointed in Wendigo, though.

I tried some cranberry-infused gin drink, and it was overly sweet with lemonade. Not horrible, though. They have a decent list of tap beers as well, including the delicious Fantasy Factory from Karben4.

I ordered the roasted chicken, which was fine. Nothing about it really wowed me, and the vegetable mush and gravy under the chicken was kind of gross. The chicken seemed to be nicely cooked, but didn't exactly punch me in the face with flavor. Not sure what was all in the vegetable mush, but it had tons of bacon in it.

One of my roommates ordered the Phorench Dip, which he said was greasy. The meat was overly chewy and weird tasting. His words, not mine.

My other roommate ordered the Fried Tomato Po' Boy, which he thought was okay, but nothing special.

Our service was fine, with a chatty server and food coming out pretty quickly.

The restaurant is pretty small and intimate and decently decorated. It's a cozy little place, and there was some cool art hung up on the walls.

Overall, it was an okay experience. But I won't be traveling in the cold to Stoughton for Wendigo anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner. We started with the cheese curds which were lightly battered and melty. I had the tomato po'boy and loved all the flavors - fried tomatoes, pickled mushrooms, and avocado blended amazingly well together. The sweet potato fries side came with a spicy dipping sauce which I loved! My husband got the Cannibal Burger - a meat patty that is wrapped around meat... it was huge, garlicky, and delicious! He got the regular fries as his side and they were the best we've had at a restaurant! Crunchy and salty outside and fluffy inside. Yum!
The drinks were amazing - house infused vodkas made unique cocktails. We had a lemon thyme vodka lemonade, a ginger mojito, and watermelon punch! Or stick to the traditional drinks and the bartender can make you anything! Not into the hard stuff? They have a diverse selection of bottled beers and rotating tap selections. There's also a full wine list, which we didn't sample this time.
The decor is simple and bright. The walls are exposed brick that are off white, and some painted parts that are a beautiful forest blue green. Large paintings of wolves, bison, and birds of prey enhance the wild woods theme. We haven't had a real Wendigo monster sighting so far, thank goodness!
We will have to go back and try more of their house made drinks and unique menu selections - next time I want the trout tacos!"}
{"text":"Excellent, imaginative, changing, farm-to-table creations in an upscale bar/bistro environment with helpful, friendly staff at a very nice cost-to-quality ratio!  Eat there, and often!"}
{"text":"Went here once for the fish fry and loved it! Came back again and the food was not good at all. We had the cheese curds and they were so greasy. Enough to make you sick honestly. I had the eggplant burger and I did not like it at all. It lacked taste and was a soggy mess. My boyfriend had the burger, it was extremely over cooked!! If you're looking for a good fish fry, this place is a good option with good cocktails."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding. I was puzzled, though, by the waitstaff's reluctance to put on a pot of decaf coffee - \"It will take 25 minutes\". Have these folks never heard of doing \"pour-overs\"? (let's work on providing service, not excuses)"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back to Wendigo.  My friend and I live in Madison and she convinced me to drive down, and I'm so glad she did!  Our drinks were super tasty, the salad was delicious (and kind of enormous...), and our two mains - the sweet potato gnocchi and the pork - were both ridiculously good.  I don't know if we had anything to complain about!  Also, we were surprised we didn't have to pay double for what we got (esp. quality-wise).

The service was good too: friendly, quick, knowledgeable.  Oh yeah: though casual seemed to be fine, I think next time we'll go dressed more \"nice casual.\"

Total home run as far as we were concerned :)"}
{"text":"This place was crazy good. As good as any restaurants in Chicago. We had the beef ribs, pork belly Club and Vietnamese pork. One was better then the other. All were top shelf. The service was perfect. Heidi was friendly and very knowledgeable. 

You must get to this joint."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is always prepared well, the drinks are delicious, and the atmosphere is relaxing but fun. My husband and I have been here multiple times and we've bought gift certificates for friends and family.
If you have the chance to go, take advantage of it. I don't think you will regret it.
The only downsides are that since it's farm to table they run out of menu items faster than I would like (so order it if you think it sounds good) and the bathrooms could use a little updating since the fixtures are a bit broken in the women's room."}
{"text":"Delicious, unique, and could hold up in any big city setting. The fried cheese curds and the fried pickled veggies were amaaaaaaazing. :) The service was great, and the atmosphere was welcoming and adorable."}
{"text":"Stoughton finally has a restaurant that will pull in foodies from Madison and the surrounding areas.  This place is cool.  The first thing we noticed were the infused concoctions that were being used to make interesting and delicious cocktails.  The bar tender was knowledgeable and personable and really had the mixology thing going on.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting with just the right amount of the hipster thing going on.  We've only had appetizers thus far and they were delicious so we're eager to branch out into their fresh and interesting looking dinner menu for our next visit.  Hallelujah!  Because of Wendigo, Stoughton's finally on the map in the culinary world."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary somewhat last minute.  The wait was only 15 minutes, which wasn't bad.  They were pretty busy.  We started off with the poutine, which was delicious and just right.  My wife had the pickled beet and melon salad, which also had goat cheese and green beans.  She enjoyed it very much.  I had the Cannibal burger and Mac and cheese.  The burger and bun were so good.  The burger was a pork and beef combination with pork jowl and sirloin.  Very tasty!  I had wanted to go here for quite a while, and tonight was perfect.  We will definitely go back!  The server was very nice and helpful as well!"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to Stoughton, a town sorely lacking when it comes to quality affordable food. There was overpriced preprepared/reheated food (I.e. Laz bistro) and there's quality expensive food (big sky) but nothing in the middle. Wendigo fits the bill. Great food at good prices. 

My only qualm about their food is they overseason (salt) their food. I like salt, probably too much for my health but their cheese curds are way too salty even for me. Their au jus for the \"phorench\" sandwich is super flavorful but CRAZY salty. Same goes for their green bean casserole.  This is why I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars. Don't cut all of the salt, but maybe 30% to start.

Update since my original review:
They have taken heed and have reduced the salt content it seems.  I've been back several times and its MUCH better.  Additionally I've tried their Brunch twice...YUM YUM YUM!!!!  

My old qualm is they tend to leave their green bean casserole under the broiler for too long and the onion crisps are more often then not burnt.  It's a tough balance but something to work on."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation and it was much better than we thought!  The poutine was outstanding and the best my boyfriend had ever had!  I had the Wendi melt and he had the club house and both were great!  Decor needed a lift but I'm an interior designer so I usually pick the decor apart....great old building!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Wendigo.  It is our go to restaurant in Stoughton.  The staff is friendly, the menu is not extensive but even the pickiest eaters will be pleased with the selections.  We are addicted to the sweet potato fries with the special dipping sauce.  It is very busy on the weekends, so either call for reservations or plan on having a drink at the bar.  I HIGHLY recommend the bloodi Wendi. The infused vodka makes this a spectacular drink.  For that matter plan on a stop at the bar. It is well worth the time s talking with the bartenders about the infusing process."}
{"text":"Was super surprised at how hip and awesome this place was. Cheese curds were the bomb.com and loved the Wendi melt! My boyfriend also loved the Cannibal burger. Staff was super friendly and helpful! We're coming again and bringing more people. :)"}
{"text":"Where have I been?  65 reviews!  I just heard about this place because I purchased the Madison city tin.  It is nestled in historic downtown Stoughton.  Parking is a pain, maybe there is a simple solution but I am not familiar with Stoughton.  

You can make reservations!! Day of or ahead of time.  

Now let's get to it.  LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE.  I was impressed by the small, yet intriguing menu.  I ordered the beer battered cheese curds.  They did not skimp!  None of the curds are bite-sized.  They are juicy and large.  For $8 it is a steal.  The sriracha aioli is nice for people who want something other than traditional ranch.  

They have several home infused liquors. 

I ordered the Wendi-melt with the green bean casserole.  The casserole was good, but keep in mind it is done with their own twist.  I LOVED that I did not have to get fries!  I also had the option of mac and cheese at no additional cost.  It was really hard to make choices.  

The melt was amazing!  Prime rib and harvati.  It was so juicy and did not need any au jus.  I just can not stop thinking about it.  I felt so great in there.  OH!  I ordered homemade lemonade as my beverage. Sweet, sour and amazing.  

I can not wait to go back.  The portions were nice without being huge.  Give this place a try, I can not imagine you will regret it.  

Service wise, they are very hands off.  It is a relaxed setting and there a tons of people who will help.  The owner is the hostess and the busser.  She never stopped and we had great service.  If you expect someone to be at your table every 5 minutes, please just go to Chili's.  Wendigo is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The best restaurant in Stoughton and one of the best in Dane County."}
{"text":"The best brunch in town! They recently started doing brunch again, I hope they continue! My boyfriend and I have never had a meal here that we haven't absolutely loved. Their cocktails are always creative and delicious. We love that they source their ingredients from local farms and vendors, everything always tastes fresh! AND THE CHEESE CURDS...THE BEST I HAVE HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Poutine is absolutely to die for! Never thought I would ever like anything like that, but now I visit as often as possible for the gravy goodness! Everything we've on the menu has been amazing. So happy we finally found a place that is affordable & fine dining, with locally grown enthusiasm. #YUM"}
{"text":"Update: brunch! 
I had the chorizo polenta from the spring brunch menu. Clean plate. Delicious, made in-house chorizo. Could use more paprika, but it's just the right amount of spicy.

Another update for brunch - I had a fritatta with veggies and cheese that was great. Probably the healthiest thing on the decadent brunch menu. It was a treat."}
{"text":"I have yet to make it to Wendigo for dinner, but their seasonal Sunday brunch is amazing!  Breakfast/brunch is my favorite meal and I've been to numerous places all around the Madison area and this is one of the best, if not the best.  Some places try too hard to be creative and it just doesn't work.  Wendigo is different.  Their dishes are well thought out and truly put unique spin on brunch.  Most recently I had a pork belly hash, that was incredible.    A mix of phenomenally seasoned potatoes, diced pork belly, and egg.   I could have eaten two servings.  And my kids can't stop talking about the Oreo pancakes.  Wendigo also serves some of the best coffee."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, the best in Stougton by far. The service is great and ambiance can't be beat. For a cocktail or dinner, you will not find a better place in Stoughton. The food is so worth the trip down from Madison. FEED THE BEAST! 

And don't forget to check out Famous Yeti's Pizza, owned by the same family and serving up the best pizza in Stoughton and beyond."}
{"text":"BEST CURDS IN THE MADISON AREA!!! Sooo good! And that's saying something, because we try the curds pretty much everywhere we go. The entrees that my husband and I got were good, not great. But this place infuses their own liquor with awesome flavors such as raspberry, cucumber, rhubarb, and melon!"}
{"text":"They have a very nice job remodeling the inside of the restaurant. Before Wendigo opened here the space was very dark inside, it is now very bright and cheery.  Very hipster in style and menu. It smelled delicious upon walking in the main entrance. Service can be slow. The hostess also buses tables so sometime when you walk in there is no one to check in with or put your name in with. Because of the way the building is designed the restaurant is very loud. The food was very good though. Their sweet potato fries are amazing and they put aioli on their burgers! We just loved the food!"}
{"text":"Overall: Very Solid food, awesome cocktail menu, cool building.  

Details: We went to Wendigo on a Friday night not too long ago. Tons of good reviews made the drive to Stoughton seem worth it. And we were certainly not disappointed. 

Started with the Pigs in a Blanket, and upscale version of one of my favorite childhood foods. The puff pastry is an awesome upgrade to this meal, and the mustards on the side are incredible. I highly recommend this as a starter. 

The fiance and I then split the Kale Caeser Salad. I would say it was solid, but unspectacular. Poached egg on top was a nice, unique touch to the salad. 

For the main course I had the Wendi Melt, which is a sandwich comprised of shaved prime rib, havarti, shallots, and some other deliciousness. And HOLY COW (get it??) was it A.Ma.Zing. The Prime Rib was fall apart in your mouth tender, with a great sear on it. The cheese, shallots, and sauce complemented the meat so well, while still letting the prime rib shine. I would make the drive all the way back to Stoughton for this sandwich alone. 

As a side, I chose the mac & cheese. I would say it was fine, but would probably order a different side next time. 

My fiance had the lamb ragu, and was kind enough to give me a bite. I had to fight the urge to steal her whole meal, as the depth and complexity of flavors in that bowl was what Guy Fieri would call \"on point\". 

They infuse all of the alcohols for their cocktails, which is really a cool idea. We had old fashioned's with an apple cinnamon brandy, a really nice spin on the classic cocktail. My only drawback was they were out of 3 of the 7 cocktails on the menu, because they had ran out of the infusions. Very disappointing as all 3 sounded great. 


Overall, great meal. I waffled between 4 and 5 stars, but just a couple things (the salad, drinks not being available, side dishes) kept it from getting that 5th star. But have no fear Wendigo, we will be back!"}
{"text":"A coworker of mine had spoken well of Wendigo so when we were planning to see a show at The Stoughton Opera House we decided to give it a try. And the results of our experience there were a resounding SO GOOD!

Sarah Jane was our server and we loved her. She was attentive and fun and quirky (I love quirky) and got us out of there on time for our concert. We hope to have her again. The atmosphere/ambiance was great - beautiful artwork (local artist) and gorgeous wood throughout. It was a bit loud with it being a Friday night and there's really nothing to absorb the sound, but we managed to communicate with our friends at the table with no problem. Our drinks were nothing to write home about. I had a vodka tonic and my husband had the lemonade. They were fine - nothing special.

We started off with the cheese curds, which came with both a siracha mayo and ranch. The curds were pretty close to perfect - lightly battered, crunchy, buttery and nicely seasoned. The 2 sauce option was great. The ranch was exactly what I wanted (and it's some of the best ranch I've had in a long time) and my husband wanted the siracha mayo so that couldn't have worked out better.

We don't make a habit of this, but we both ended up ordering the Clubhouse sandwich with fries for our entrees. The toasted sandwich was rich with many textures and perfectly balanced. The smoked turkey with melted cheddar, pork belly and lemon basil mayo all married together in a way that rendered us speechless. We just kept nodding at each other and smiling in our food bliss.

Neither of us could finish our meals so Sarah Jane boxed them up, wrote what was in each box and dated them. Very thoughtful! I look forward to trying other dishes at Wendigo (especially the Cannibal burger) and may even see about requesting Sarah Jane as our server. And I really need to find Natalie Wright - her artwork is amazing! Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"A party of 4 of us stopped in last Saturday and were pleasantly surprised.  From an interior perspective, I thought Wendigo was visually appealing.  I am a sucker for anything old and/or historic so the high ceilings and brick walls were right up my alley.  It's a beautiful and comfortable space.
The menu is small and focuses on appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and entrees.  The drink menu has a few cocktails listed as well as beer on tap as well as a chalkboard of specialty bottles.  My girlfriend and I opted for two cocktails and both were a little lackluster.
Our food, however, didn't disappoint.  We started off with chees curds.  The batter was light and airy and the cheese inside being perfecly melted orbs of goodness.  I would definitely have these again on a return visit.  For our meals, we went with the cannibal burger (stuffed with tenderloin and pork jowl and a eggplant and haloumi sandwhich.  I was disappointed I wasn't asked what temperature I wanted my burger cooked to.  As a result, the burger arrived slightly more done that I would have wanted and resulting, a little dry.  Be warned: the burger definitely on the bigger side for those with lighter appetites.
The eggplant sandwhich was good as well.  Perhaps the only thing lacking was seasoning.
I don't find myself in Stoughton much (lets be honest, I needed google maps to get there) but if I ever do get back, I wouldn't think twice of coming back here.  Fair food.  Fair price.  Great setting."}
{"text":"5stars for me! Love the vibes and I think the cheese curds are on my top 3 in the Madison stoughton areas! Food both times were yummy and fresh  fun drinks too"}
{"text":"A Foodie Bar with spectacular Drinks and Wait Staff. I really enjoyed the Mohito and Old Fashioned drinks. I was disappointed that I had a late  lunch and only snacked on the excellent meat plate. A great app for 4 too much for one. But do order it half and half with cheese and order extra bread. This is a great treat. My next visit is a Chef's special of lamb.....to have a great relaxing spot, good drinks AND a Chef that is passionate to prepare lamb, this is a travelers Lucky Haven. Wish it was closer to home. The flavored spirits and craft beers make this a modern day go to spot for a great time in the historical downtown......Desert?...never got that far, something else to look forward to."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant near Madison. They use local ingredients and everything is fresh and full of flavor. They are also very cases and kid friendly. They even have an area with toys to distract the little guests. 

Since we are in Wisconsin, we decided to try a lot of cheese and dairy items. We had the WI cheese plate which featured a cheddar, a mild Swiss, a Gouda type, a blue, and a bit of smoked cheese as well as candies nuts, rhubarb butter, and fresh bread. Most of the cheese was okay. It was missing a strong cheese which would have added a little more complexity to the plate. The rhubarb butter was tangy and not too sweet. It didn't really compliment any of the cheeses. Basically nothing on the plate seemed to be intended to go together which is unlike other cheese plates I've tried. We also had the Mac n cheese which had a nice cheesy bechamel type sauce and was topped with melted cheddar. 

We also had the Watermelon holumi salad. It had baby greens, big watermelon chunks, cucumbers, cheese and aight vinaigrette. It was refreshing and light. It could have had a bit more cheese though as the cheese was overpowered by the other ingredients so it's flavor was muted. 

We shared the Phorench dip as our entree. We got the green bean casserole as our side dish. The dip was interesting. Intended to be reminiscent of pho. It was spicy and the dipping broth was really rich. It was served on a nice baguette which held up nicely to the dipping and didn't fall apart when you were eating. It was as very good sandwich. The green bean were really yummy - topped with fried onions, but much better than any my mom every made. 

For dessert we got a slice of the Bourbon peach pie. It was not too sweet with nice peach chunks and a good crust. They had ice cream, but we took our slice to go so I can only imagine how tasty that would be with the pie. 

They have a good beer list with lots of local options."}
{"text":"This place is trendy, with in-house flavored hard liquor and cute decor, plus the food is amazing. My husband had the fish fry - perfectly crispy and flakey. I had the Phorench Dip, and honestly, it was the best sandwich I have ever eaten! Two of my favorite things in one!?! French Dips and pho! It was a dream come true. I don't know if I can order anything but that next time I go there, which will be soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing Food and Quant Atmosphere. We went here for dinner on a Friday night. It was our first time and read all of the great reviews so decided to give it a try. The food was very fresh and delicious. I ordered a burger and fries my mother ordered a salad. The server was very friendly and took great care of us. I recommend stooping in and trying this restaurant if you are a local or just visiting Stoughton. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is great! We ate at the bar and had the poutine. The plan was to move to a table, but the appetizer was pretty filling so we split the Cannibal burger a bit later. 

Nice atmosphere, good music, interesting menu. 

The bartenders are pleasant and engaging, but lack some training. Any tender worth her salt sees silent cues- empty glasses, bottles empty and pushed to the edge, a credit card laying out, ready to pay. This skill hasn't been shared. Not a business killer, but a missing piece. 

All in all, very good small restaurant. We'll be back and we'll flag down bartenders as necessary."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Friendly staff, fast service, and great live music (Daniel Scott)! Order the Poutine!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great atmosphere, drinks, beer list, and food :)  Enough vegetarian options for me.  The fried green tomato po-boy is fantastic.  As an additional perk, the owner is a really great guy.  The last time I was there I left my lights on and my car battery died.  I went back in to the restaurant to see if anyone could help, and a man volunteered immediately.  As he was jumping my car I found out he is the owner of Wendigo.  Such a nice guy!  Will keep returning."}
{"text":"Fun drinks and menu. The Pho-rench dip was loved by all as well as the roasted red pepper soup. Gluten free bread available."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I met some friends at Wendigo for brunch on Easter. Let me note right away, Wendigo makes a nice, ambitious morning bike ride for Madison Eastsiders and then one can drink their 11am beer without guilt! Plus your bikes will lock nicely on the side of Wendigo's front stoop. 
We're big fans of Famous Yeti's Pizza so we were curious to check out the newest mythical-beast namesake from that family. 
Everything we ordered was tasty and the concise brunch menu offers something for everyone. I'm always on the lookout for something novel in the sweet side of breakfast so I was very pleased with the Creme Brûlée French toast, topped with a vanilla glaze and crispy bacon. The texture was ideal, not soggy but crispy on the edges and indulgent all the way through. 
My dining companions tried the fried salami sandwich with fried egg, pickled red onion, and banana pepper, the spring onion and mushroom omelette, and some beautiful banana pancakes, which looked more like oversized crepes. Breakfast cocktail lovers won't be disappointed either. The downtown Stoughton location is sweet and the place itself is warm and gorgeous with a beautiful wood bar, built in stage, wood floors, complimented with welcoming wood tables and a piano. The whole look was topped off with some endearing, simple animal portrait paintings. Both servers who helped us were warm, welcoming, and attentive. In fact our only complaint is that the breakfast potatoes were borderline underdone. I'd be very excited to go back for a meal or just for drinks."}
{"text":"This place popped up in a Yelp search, and on a whim my husband and I decided to try it. Wow - I can't tell you how impressed we were! We split the poutine and Phorench dip with green bean casserole. Everything we tried was phenomenal! The Phorench dip was one of he best sandwiches I've ever had. The poutine was to die for (try it with the brisket!). And I love that they had top-notch sides for no extra charge. We will definitely be back. Wendigo has secured a spot as one of our favorite restaurants in the Madison area."}
{"text":"A great restaurant with a farm-to-table type restaurant! The menu was changing over while we were there to feature new items, but the sandwich I had was really good with unique flavors. Highly recommend the food! 

Only downside is the entrance is not wheelchair accessible, about 5-6 steps up into the place. Once inside, the men's bathroom can accommodate a small wheelchair."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I really wanted to like this place. 

THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE!! 

We came here for brunch on Sunday 5/1. The place was empty.. Maybe a few other people. 

First off we tried to order drinks. They have a drink on the menu called snow bird with no description. So we asked what is a snow bird? Her answer.. Wait for it...\"it's a tequila drink\"..... Seriously? That's it?... it's a glass of tequila?  We had to pry the explanation out of her... 

Ok, so then we ordered food. she couldn't explain any of the brunch menu items either. A person in our group asked about GF options.... Her answer \"I don't know\". Ok.. Not a problem can you please go ask? I know sometimes it's not the easiest thing to know the menu, but at least offer to find out if you don't know. 

Once our food arrived 45 minutes later (first time we saw her since she took our order) it was lackluster. My dish (chicken and waffles) was decent. My wife's dish was cold but they offered to warm it up. Which is fine, but we didn't see her until half way through the meal. everyone else at the table said their meals were fairly good. 

Another thing that kills me at a restaurant... When there are empty cups and plates on the table for an extended period of time. She came by 3 times, and not once did she take one item off the table. 

Seriously- this was a neat little place with pretty good food, but the service was so bad that it took away from the experience.... At least for me."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem when we first moved to this small town. The restaurant itself is very quaint. It has gorgeous bright artwork on the walls and it's just the kind of place you want to stop into on a cold winter night. The food and cocktail menu changes with the seasons and it's consistently delicious and well prepared. We come here often for the warm atmosphere, poutine fries, and drinks."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD! I've been here twice and got salads both time and both were amazing. Their drinks are great too. Whoever the chef is should be world famous."}
{"text":"What can I say but Amazing!! Food is creative and delicious. Atmosphere is relaxed and inviting . The menu has a little something for everyone.  The staff was also attentive and very friendly. I would definitely advise you to go there. Now!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, so all recommendations came from the bartender.  The cocktail was ok but for $8 was overpriced. Cauliflower vesuvio was underwhelming with a very vinegar taste - see photo. It seemed like something you might make at home with the veggies you need to eat before they go bad, then dumped in a can of garbanzos as an afterthought. I couldn't finish it. The Wendigo melt was recommended over the burger, and gets points for being served hot but the macaroni and cheese side was not good enough to keep on the menu. Visit the Great Dane. They do macaroni and cheese right. Service was friendly but recommendations were off. Plenty of yummy places to dine in Madison. Don't go out of your way for this place. The prices are in line with what you'd pay at an average place on the square, but the quality of food is lacking."}
{"text":"I had a quick meal here, the arugula salad with potatoes and the Hopothesis Fallin' Oats beer. Both were the recommended by Brandon, the bartender. Great service and very friendly staff. The salad and beer were excellent. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My family of four had a nice meal here.  Service was great, fun atmosphere.  Somewhat limited menu options.  Kids didn't like the homemade cheese curds, but everyone enjoyed their entrees.  The Phorench dip sandwich was awesome.  Eggplant burger was okay.  Great grilled cheese and lemonade (according to my daughter).  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We will be back.  Good Mojotos.  Good fish fry.  Great Cole slaw & asparagus.  My husband enjoyed the green bean casserole and Fish fry.  Our boys split the burger.  One liked, the picky one did not.
We will be back.  :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed this place. 

We came here for brunch and it was pretty quiet which we didn't mind at all.

Our server was really sweet and friendly. 

My husband had the WBLT (W stands for WAFFLE!) and I had a delicious chorizo dish. I ordered a bloody Mary which was spiced with Sriracha. That was not my favorite.  

They are actually super kid friendly and had toys and books for my 11 month old to play with. They also are supporters of breastfeeding so I call on all my breastfeeding mama's to come here and support them too!

The prices are decent as well. I can't wait to try the normal menu sometime."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Downtown Madison atmosphere in good ol little Stoughton!"}
{"text":"Ive loved coming to wendigos since it opened. The food is always fantastic. The atmosphere is great. Lastly the owner is the best part. You dont see very many owners that will take the time to serve your food and talk with you. He will recognize you and take the time to ask about your family. Its a great place to eat as well as his pizza joint famous yettis. Check them both out"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for Wendigo based on other reviews, but it didn't live up to the hype. When the first person in our party arrived she let the hostess know that we had a reservation. The hostess responded that she didn't have any reservations, turned, and walked away. We hung out at the bar until our full party arrived and were eventually seated - the place was less than half full, with probably only about 6 tables occupied. Despite this, it took an extremely long time to get our drinks and a high chair.

Over half of the menu items had changed since its printing, so ordering was a bit confusing, and when the food arrived, the quality was mixed. My pork belly hash was good (but small), one omelet came overcooked and burnt. At one point a server came by with coffee refills and started pouring into a cup without asking, I let her know it was decaf and she stopped, then tried to do the same with my cup (I was drinking tea). She turned and left the table without asking if we wanted refills for our decaf and tea or offering to come back.

When it came time to pay, we asked to split our check, but apparently splitting it three ways was too confusing for the server. She ended up doing it, after we identified each person's meals on the menu, but not with a good attitude.

The inside was nice, and they have a cute little stage area, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"We tried out Wendigo for dinner tonight and overall had a good experience.  I would rate the following things as 5 stars:

1. Atmosphere- cool old building, very tastefully decorated, tables were a decent distance apart (so you don't feel like you're on an awkward blind date with the people next to you). Lots of beautiful old wood, art on the walls, and even a beautiful little wooden stage that would be prefect for small bands to play there

2. Service: our server was friendly, attentive, and overall did a great job

3. The drink selection was very good- a variety of really good beers both bottled and on tap

4. The cheese curds were AWESOME. Good enough that for some reason my husband felt compelled to exclaim \"GOD BLESS AMERICA!\" after eating one. Very large and clearly made from scratch, greasy but somehow also light at the same time. The ranch dipping sauce was excellent, though we were not huge fans of the sriracha sauce. I'm not sure why this stuff is so trendy nowadays (seriously, it's EVERYWHERE! It's the PBR of condiments- it's been around forever, but once the hipsters \"discover\" it, it's suddenly on every fancy restaurant menu, even though it was never that great to begin with.  Sorry, getting off topic, here. End mini-rant.)

And here are the things I would give 3-4 stars:

1. Husband had the Phorench Dip with sweet potato fries. He said it was tasty, but he felt like the aforementioned sriracha overtook the flavor and said it would be great if they just had a different flavor of aoli instead. 

2. I had the Roasted Artichoke and Ramp tart. It came with a decent sized mixed greens salad, which was really good, though I was not a huge fan of the tart itself.  First of all, I didn't see or taste anything resembling ramps. What I did find were what appeared to be overcooked asparagus. When cooked, Artichokes tend to get mushy, so when you put them together with asparagus, it comes out just tasting bland and...well, mushy. I think it would have been better had it been artichokes with maybe a different vegetable. It certainly wasn't horrible, but I probably wouldn't order it again.  

Overall, we would definitely go back- there were plenty of other delicious-sounding things on the menu we'd like to try!"}
{"text":"Amazing new addition to Stoughton! If you're a local, coming to a show at the Opera House, just passing through, or looking for dining experience outside of Madison, this is your place!

Everything is great about Wendigo - food, drinks, atmosphere, service and price. It has house-infused liquors for cocktails. It has a terrific beer list, both on tap and in bottles. And it has a small but well-considered wine selection. The most expensive entree is about $17, but you can also order something as simple as a grilled cheese for $4. The food is quality sourced, exalted bar food - featuring everything from cheese curds to burgers to meat and cheese platters to ribs to sandwiches to fish tacos."}
{"text":"Great place today meet up with friends or have a date night. Poutine was savory with bites of beef brisket. Mac & cheese is rich & yummy. French Dip is very good, with the shredded pickled relish. If you bring kids, there are some toys on the staircase to help keep them occupied. Tapped it off with Upland Oktoberfest & Black Philip hard cider. Yes, we are coming back."}
{"text":"This was a great find in Stoughton. We live out of town and appreciate all of the local farms this restaurant supports. My husband had the jerk chicken mango slaw sandwich and I had the scallops and pea shoots -spicy which I loved. Great menu selection making it had to choose. We also shared the lemon asparagus salad. The kids had Mac N cheese and one had a burger. We also a side of the seasonal veggie. It was freshly grilled asparagus. To top it off they had a great \"kids area\" with books, stuffed animals, puzzles and other kids toys. Loved it all. Will definitely be back next time we are here."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Had the cheese curds and they were so puffy and so different. Best ever! Too bad they've already run out of calamari and shrimp at 10pm-a little bit too early for a night place. 
The cocktails were really good. Sad that they don't have the watermelon cocktail anymore :(
Only thing to complain about is the slow service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, better service, even better food. Go here. Eat anything. Order the poutine fries. You're welcome."}
{"text":"If you want to eat here, I would suggest making a reservation. We stopped in early Wednesday evening and even though we saw empty tables, we were told we needed reservations due to the Stoughton Opera House having a show. Apparently they cater to Opera House patrons ahead of other paying customers."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because it's not as romantic as I had hoped... More open and cafe style. Food is...wow! Great local beer selection. The cheese curds are a Must Try!!"}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!   In lieu of menu items they had a buffet.  Looked as though to get rid of food before holiday closure.  Two sandwiches took incredibly long. One of the cooks wore his pants well below his ass and constantly pulled them up.  (He was observed filling the salad).  Asked for mashed potatoes but since they were on the buffet I wasn't allowed to order them. Very difficult to remember what was and was not available on the menu.   BTW--- we had been waiting to try this restaurant based on Yelp reviews.  One of the first times Yelp reviews were so wrong."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The food here is definitely not run of the mill. The Wendi Melt was mouthwatering -- add a side of the green bean casserole and it just completes it! I've also tried their zucchini tots and beer battered cheese curds and YUM! Their portions are a good size too. 

I love the fact that they use ingredients which are locally sourced. I'm also very impressed that Wendigo often participates in community events that raise money for charities. E.g. recently they were THE ONLY business in all of Stoughton that was part of fundraising for D.A.I.S. ( domestic abuse intervention services) by donating a percentage of their sales. Gotta love that!

Service would be the main part that could be improved on. Little things like clearing the table of empty plates and glasses and refilling of drinks. I would be more apt to be patient while waiting for the main entrees if my beverage isn't kept empty for too long. 

Otherwise keep up the great job Wendigo! We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"So this is a nice new addition to the Stoughton dining scene.  The owners did a great job renovating the space and making it roomy but able to squeeze a decent amount of tables in.  Honestly, we went early so there was no rush.  They had no problem with us bringing our baby in too.  The setting is rustic and elegant at the same time.   Music is mostly new folk and blue grass (think Old Crow Medicine Show, Trampled by Turtles, etc.), which I love.  The server was very friendly and excited about the menus.  The menu items were all very reasonable priced and a value for what you get.

The food we really liked: Cheese Curds, Fried & Pickled Giardanera, triple vinegar pulled pork

OK:  The Beef ribs.  Not a meaty beef rib like you might think of and it was tough getting what little meat there was on the bone.  But everything tasted good on the plate.

Cocktails: Solid.  No complaints as they both were tasty.  The beer selection is a good one too.  I wouldn't say it is small it's just very good and if a list is too long, I'd worry about the freshness.

Solid place to go before a show at the Opera House or just for anyday."}
{"text":"Every single thing I have tried here has been just outstanding. Food, drinks, service. I love that they change up their menu with the seasons. Even just a simple cheeseburger and fries here is rock solid. And at $8, it's a steal!"}
{"text":"I came to Wendigo to have dinner. It is a great little bar. A decent selection of beer. Their food is GREAT! I had the Canibal burger because it was recommended to me. It was so delicious! I have heard many of their other selections are delicious as well."}
{"text":"The absolute best Bloody I have ever had was followed by a delightful array of appetizers, entrees and a fantastic dessert. Our double date turned into a tasting as we all decided to try as many different items as possible on the diverse menu. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I've been in to Wendigo a couple times now. The first time I was in, I was surprised at how much I loved it. The food was quite delicious. The specialty cocktails did not disappoint. The atmosphere was nice and I really liked the way the interior was decorated. 

The only thing I see there could be improvement on was the service. The waitress and the bartender both seemed nice enough, but it just seemed painfully slow to get a drink and then for the food to come out. The place was by no means packed or even busy while we were there, so it was a bit confusing as to what the hold up could have been. This was a recurrence on both visits. If they could just figure out how to step up the pace a little bit, I think the overall experience would be much better. 

I will still go back though. The food was great!"}
