{"text":"We come to this location for consistent quality, service and a great selection.  I've been to this particular location many times over the years with friends, family and company functions.  I rarely eat at Chinese AYCE places but when I do it's usually where the eaters can't decide what to eat and it's a mixed group then this is our go to place cos there is something for everyone.  If you are on diet and trying to lose weight I'd suggest to stay away cos the selection is overwhelming.  For the money, it's good value and if you eat in moderation, this will be a good experience.  The high turnover of food in a busy buffet restaurant is a very good thing... nothing worse than having food under a heat lamp drying up cos no one is eating it.

Oddly enough, I don't really enjoy the Chinese food (not much is really authentic and the taste tolerable so nothing you would write home about), sushi or pizza is a forgettable experience (or regrettable depending on your stomach) but it's the roast beef I like here.  If you like beef ribs, this is my personal pick though I'm rather fussy when it comes to handling food requiring the use of hands to eat.  It's also not good for you if you have health issues which is why I would restrict my appearances here to less than 3-4 times a year unless you enjoy seeing your heart surgeon on a regular basis.  Still they have enough variety here where a vegetarian can get by or if you want to just have desserts and salads alone, you can still have someone cart you out in a wheel barrel.

One of the good aspects of the Mandarin is you will get the same experience at all their locations and they're always busy.  Having said that, I strongly suggest reservations but this caused some problems with our group on our last visit cos there was a party that reserved an entire section for 90 people but only 50 showed up when we requested a section for our group of 70 and all of us showed up.  This resulted in us being shoehorned into a smaller section where we were crammed eating (14-15 sitting squeezed at a table that sits 12) while the section next to us had 6 people eating at a table of 12.  It was the only time we've encountered this situation and clearly an operations issue that they may want to address.  Still this is a solid 4 star establishment."}
{"text":"Somehow I end up at the Mandarin once or twice a year.....for about 20 years now.
My dining experience here each of those times has been pretty much identical. This surprises me. Time after time after time, it's the same. It hasn't got better, hasn't got worse.

Selection: Large. Shrimp, to crab legs, to roast beef, to teppanyaki to pizza, to soups etc....
                Don't come here for the sushi, though they have it.
                Possibly the largest dessert selection I've seen

Fresh:  Yes. It's always busy so replenishment is continuous. 

Ambiance:  Your only reason to come here should be to eat. Get my drift?
                  And it's always busy. Always.

Service: Very attentive and friendly. Plates cleared, waters refilled, new drinks brought, all right when you need it. 

Price: Appropriate for what you get."}
{"text":"I'm not someone who likes to eat buffet but when I am hungry this is good as any place. It is not my first choice for Chinese buffets but the location is great and easily accessible but subway. One meal here and you probably won't be hungry for a few hours"}
{"text":"Let's put it this way: once my husband asked me where I wanted to eat on my birthday and I said \"The Mandarin\" so we went there---and the Mandarin is in Toronto, and we live in Chicago.  I have counted 48 hot Chinese entrees on the Mandarin's Chinese buffet, plus six kinds of soup and ten kinds of ice cream, a vast salad bar with ad lib shrimp, a grill with salmon or chicken or steak (also the Mandarin in London ONT had baby lamb chops when we were there), the Canadian buffet has roast beef  with mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding, and the last time we were at Yonge Street they had added a waffle station. I do not want to hear ONE WORD about this not being authentic Chinese food: fall silent at once. The Mandarin is a Canadian treasure."}
{"text":"Make reservations or they will give you the worst attitude you'll ever receive for the day.

5 stars for the service. My server was very attentive, helpful, and had a sense of humour.

1 star for the food. I was with a group of friends, but two of them started vomiting in the washroom, so we left early. When we went back, one of them kept on vomiting and started crying because of the pain she was in. I wasn't sick, but if you look online, there was several reports of being sick from eating at this location! Try to eat food with a high turnover (hot food and the ones that's made in front of you) and avoid the ones that aren't as popular (kelp, pickled veg) to avoid getting sick if you are coming! 

1 star for the grill chef. Burnt me with hot oil and just sort of stared at me with a blank face. To be fair, she looked like she was a high school student or something but at least you could have said sorry."}
{"text":"Very busy Saturday night.  The food was restocked without any delay.  The quality was typical for a buffet.  Not the best but adequate.

The waiter was friendly and attentive despite the busy atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a buffet chain.  New manager/ owner.., impressed me to the nines- I mentioned to her that I miss certain dish they had before and she has it prepared  just for me.  

Thank you, Paddy!a"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I literally die and go to buffet heaven. There is nothing bad about this restaurant...except for maybe those sketchy green mints they offer you when you're about to leave..

I definitely ALWAYS get my money's worth. I literally eat until I can't eat anymore. As soon as I pay my bill, I find a place to beach until I am physically capable of moving again. HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"alot of food to choose from
but common where are the flavors
fill your plate with crap"}
{"text":"i was here a while ago,  i guess the review never got through my i phone 3GS... back to the review! this is a pretty good place for a young adult it has all you can offer (junk food of all sorts), but for an adult it may be health concern... very greasy and fat in calories so i would not go there if i was an adult because if i had that money there are other places to go... but overall well done mandarin...well done!"}
{"text":"Mandarin is a buffet style restaurant and it's the same in almost every location. The buffet is massive and has a variety of Oriental food and desserts.

This location is nice and big. I love the huge colourful fish tanks, cozy and fun décor and their food! At the buffet you can expect: A variety of hot soups, salads, grilled veggies, plenty of Chinese and Thai dishes, sushi bar, ribs, meatloaf, seafood, waffles, desserts that include jelly, cakes, pies, fresh fruit, a sundae bar with tons of topping choices etc.  Besides water, all other drinks are not included in the buffet price. Those other drinks include- wine, coffee, cocktails, soft drinks etc.

I've always experienced the staff here to be very kind and efficient. The service has always been good. The prices are very reasonable; I think I paid under $23 for the buffet- not bad. The variety of the dishes is great, but I would not say the food is excellent quality. The food is not bad either, just in between- it's good. 

The major downfall about this particular Mandarin location for me is that it's almost always crowded with either kids who are running around or large groups of very loud teenagers. Also, every time I came here I had to wait some time in line in order to get a table. I would highly recommend making reservations to beat the line-up. 

Overall, I would recommend Mandarin if you're looking for some yummy Oriental food. However, do expect crowds and noise. Personally, I can't wait to go back for their jumbo fresh strawberries half dipped in milk chocolate!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. It's mostly frozen and deep fried. It's great if you're looking to fill your stomach."}
{"text":"like others, i don't go to Mandarin for an authentic Chinese meal, I go because the quality is good, the selection great, the staff are friendly, they validate parking. Lunch is by far the best deal, and I would not darken their door on any holiday (too busy for me). 
I don't eat that much, but I get to eat exactly what I want :-)"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION....ive been to couple of mandarin locations but never to one like this location. Actually ive never been to a restarant which gives service like this location. I was there last week with my cousins. we entered the restarant at 1:50 pm and asked if lunch was still being served, they said yea as soon as we sat the waiter told us we have to eat quick actually she said quick.quick quick.okayy? cause lunch was over at 3pm. we said okay. throughtout our stay from 2pm to 2:40 pm 2 different waiters came every 5 mins or so to tell.us to be quick. Our table was not clean and i asked for water.3 times which she finally gave and said you eat quick you pay. There were others eating too.at other tables. At last we gave in we got upset and got up to pay and when i went to pay the waiter asked if i were happy with service. when i said no, she gave me a angry look and said \"why no happy you? because you and the other waiter was rude and told us to ne quick every second i said and as soon as i said that she said something in her language loudly to the other waiters around her which didnt sound pleasent. Soo shocked, never had service or experience like this before..."}
{"text":"To anyone who wishes to come to this location and happens to drive.... DO NOT PARK HERE!

They normally would validate your parking for free but only for dinner and weekends. I don't mind this policy in place, what my concern is where they have placed the sign. Now I had my ticket validated before so I was in the routine of just driving into the parking lot and assuming they will validate my ticket. However, after being told and showed where their policy about validating parking, it was in the restaurant.... There weren't any signs before entering the parking lot about their parking policy. So I asked if I can get it validated since I didn't know... They said no, so basically for a weekday lunch, it costed me $32.50.. I say W.T.F.

Good Job Mandarin....."}
{"text":"Holy hullabalo where to begin???.... this place is absolutely HORRIBLE !!!!

I would define this place in one word as: Nauseating .  Using it in a sentence, I would say:   This place is Nauseating.

The food is awful and disgusting beyond measure, I would rather eat number two... Do not go in there, seriously, it aggravated my tummy. I feel resentful every time that I see their stupid sign on the street.  Everything that we tried was abominable, not to mention the noteworthy number of vagabonds eating in there.

On a positive note, I did appreciate the picture with Chinese sombrero.

This place is VETOED !!!"}
{"text":"The food here was mostly stale and bland. It was hard to find something that was enjoyable. Especially since half of all the food is just desserts. Unless you are looking for a dessert buffet then this place has it because the food here is definitely not worth trying."}
{"text":"Time travel is an exact science, so follow my words carefully: the year is 1998 and (you) I am a penny less college student.
  You and your roommates treat yourselves to a Mandarin weekend lunch once a month. To prepare for it you skip breakfast, maybe a light dinner the night before. We ate for hours and loaded for the rest of the month.

Short version: Mandarin got me through college.

Disclaimer: we ordered drinks and always tipped 15%, because you know, they gotta make money, and yeah don't eat out if you cannot tip, you cheap bastard."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting nothing but garbage. This is not chinese cuisine.

Have been to two different locations, got food poisoning at the Mandarin Etobicoke location."}
{"text":"I really love pizza and french fries. As such, this Chinese restaurant was the perfect place for me. The definitive must-miss experience for those who seek authentic Chinese, but otherwise perfect for the North American palate."}
{"text":"First time trying mandarin, I LOVE buffets and this one was amazing! 
Not only do they have a nice selection of Asian food but their dessert selection is the best I've seen in a long time!
Even the ice cream is great, and I usually skip that. Espresso ice cream yum!
Sushi selection could have been better but it was ok. Over all I think the flavours of food have been adjusted to please most people and I prefer more pronounced flavour in my food.

Sure, it's not 5 star dining or haute quisine or anything but the service is good and you'll roll out of this place happily stuffed and won't have to eat for another day ;-)
Appreciate the little hot towels and drinks are well taken care of including topping up the water. Friendly staff

It's a bit more pricey than ACYE sushi but the desserts make up for it ;-)"}
{"text":"You don't go into a Chinese buffet with high expectations, but I was mis-informed that this location was the best one out of all the ones in the GTA. The service is exceptionally better, but certainly not the food. 

Some items that stood out at this buffet:
1. Snow Crab Legs - very meaty, though dry and tasteless
2. Roast Beef - Over-cooked and dry. (see picture)
3. Sashimi Station - The ladies behind the counter are tremendously grumpy and will reluctantly give you more than two pieces of sashimi. Don't waste your time with the sushi options either. 
4. The only thing I liked about this buffet is the dessert section! Eight flavours of ice cream to pick from, a waffle station, creme brulee, rice/bread pudding, assortment of tarts, and even sugar-free cheese cake for the diabetics. 

Parking is validated at the front desk, so if you're driving, there's no need to stress over finding street parking."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Canadian style Chinese food.  If you want the authentic dishes you need to go to China Town, but if you are like the average dinner than there is more than enough here to please everyone.

Although I do like to go on the weekends and holidays when they have special offerings like the Crab legs, it is more economical to go on a weeknight.  Or go at 2pm for a late lunch at an even lower rate.  Almost the same offerings but at a better price.

I'm always impressed at the variety of food available and how often it is replaced with fresh pans.  Apparently the remainder is given to the staff to take home, which means that the paying dinners can be assured of hot fresh food.

There are many locations of this chain, and although very similar you may find you have a favorite that you'd like to return to more often.

Happy dinning!"}
{"text":"bottom line is that it's the best DINNER buffet in toronto which includes spare ribs, bbq ribs, beef roast and seafood including shrimp, crab legs and small lobsters.  the food quality and taste is mediocre (it's canadian chinese, not authentic), but it still delivers the best value when it comes to buffets in toronto.  and hey as much as i like authentic chinese, sometimes i want a springroll with that glistening sweet and sour sauce, honey garlic spareribs, fried noodles... you get the picture - LOL. i eat pretty healthy but sometimes i treat myself to buffet. my favourite pig out place. i always eat everything i get and don't waste.  i would recommend that you just go once around the entire buffet just to view their buffet before selecting what you want.  everybody can find something they love at this buffet....  my table was all smiles at the end..."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times for group dinners. I have never been impressed with the food or service. I also question the health standards and cleanliness of the place. Recently a patron found a dead mouse on a seat while dining with her family on Mother's Day. I read about this in a Toronto newspaper and have decided that I will never visit this spot again. No big loss since my prior visits were poor and I was only at the Mandarin to join a group that had selected the spot."}
{"text":"Just your average Asian all-you-can-eat. The entrance is a little tricky to find but it is outside next to where the TTC buses come out. They have fried noodles, sushi, desserts - like I said very very average."}
{"text":"So Mandarin has definitely lost its shine in my eyes ... we've visited a couple more times since our first visit but I think this will be the last time.  

During this visit, the only thing that appealed to me were the desserts - the waffles, the caramel flan, creme brulee, and deep fried honey sticks.  Basically, that is what I ate as my meal.  For $27 including tax and tip, that is waaay too much to pay for an unhealthy diabetes inducing meal."}
{"text":"It's an all you can eat buffet so definitely temper your expectations for that environment, right? There's certainly lots to chose from - both for a vegetarian and an omnivore. Typical small plates to get you going back for more. I honestly have to ask though, unless you eat like a hippo and stay all night to continue eating like Homer Simpson at a seafood restaurant (I mean, Bottomless Pete), do you really get your $24.99 worth? I don't feel like you do. It's all decent though so there's no need to go lower than 3 stars. Cocktails also kind of suck."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Not enough vegetarian items.  Lots of amazing desserts!  A variety of Asian foods and Canadian/American foods as well.  Very unhealthy, but nice for 3 times a year!  :)
Always busy though.  We always make a reservation!  We just went tonight (Wednesday) at 7:30 PM and it was still pretty busy!!"}
{"text":"I went back there a few months ago and noticed a huge improvement in the taste of everything, they also added new items like grilled salmon (which was awesome), and sushi (which would have been the worst I've ever had in my life, if I hadn't also eaten sushi in Mexico one time)."}
{"text":"I'm not under any illusions that this place is an authentic Chinese restaurant. I mean, they serve pizza, mashed potatoes and roast beef in the 'white people food' corner of the buffet line. Mandarin is great because it offers a variety of well made dishes. Let me clarify, well made buffet style dishes. For a buffet it's pretty decent, you have to admit. The restaurant itself is cheesy in its decor, but the staff are friendly and attentive. Not a bad place to spend 20 bucks."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout on a rainy day...picked up dinner on the way home. 

The fried chicken appetizer was good- huge portion, freshly fried and crispy. Enough for 2 people

The Black Pepper Beef Hor Fun was terrible. 
Huge portions, but they simply dumped boiled noodles into the container and poured a not-tasty-at-all black pepper gravy over it. The noodles were not stir-fried in the gravy, it was Very clumpy and extremely unappetizing. I was not impressed at all. That was simply lazy cooking at its worst."}
{"text":"It's decent for a Chinese buffet but there are other choices if you want Chinese food.
Desserts are good but not to die for."}
{"text":"I just wanted to give a shout out to manager Myles Wan and server Kelei. Without complaint I laughingly mentioned to Kelei that I had tried a dish which, although there was no red pepper on its description, turned out to be very spicy. He took it upon himself to inform Myles who presented himself at our table apologizing that the usually tame dish (which he tasted himself) was, indeed, exceptionally spicy by error that night. When he offered us a compensation we declined but we did end up enjoying a pot of jasmine tea which brought to our table compliments of the house."}
{"text":"Is Mandarin's food authentic Chinese food? No more than Tex-Mex being real authentic Mexican food. So no, it is not. It can be quite bland and flavourless. However this is not why you come to Mandarin and if you did, you may have just thrown away $25 --or however much you paid. 

Now this particular Mandarin is clean, gets really packed during dinner hours and depending on the night, reservations may be required in order to avoid unnecessary waiting and hassle.  

Which of the few times I have visited I have always gotten beforehand and they have always proven handy. 

So, like in a Masters chess game, if you selectively decide, pick and sacrifice items you will be eating, then your visit can truly become a feast to behold!

Also ignore the tried and true attempts of an AYCE staff to constantly re-fill your glass with water in order to fill your stomach with inexpensive liquids. That is not why you are there for! :P

Of course what I pick is completely subjective but this is what I do. 

Ignore:
* All Western food. I can get pizza, BBQ Beef, etc, at better restaurants. 
* All deep-fried stuff. Which I generally do anyways. 
* Most rice dishes. Who needs those calories at this point?
* Most breaded dishes as they would just taking up valuable stomach real estate.
* Most soups, as they tend not to be the best and for the same reason as above.
* Ignore most deserts, as;
A-) Most of their desserts tend to be kind of sub-par. 
B-) Personally, I am not big on the sweet-tooth.

What to love:
* Shrimps & more shrimps
* Mussels
* Crab Legs
* Sushi (Yes, it is only okay and limited but I *did* say I was being highly subjective and I like me some seafood. 
* I break for ribs!
* Seaweed salad!
* Seafood!
* Wontons and maybe the odd dumpling.
* Some steamed veggies just for taste. 

And once you are winding down, for your final moves, maybe a touch of soup or a dessert to quench the palate!  
Then, pay the bill.

Checkmate!"}
{"text":"I really like the place. It's totally worth the money. I usually eat there until it hurts. Lol My favorites are prawns, steak and duck. Lots of options to eat!"}
{"text":"You have to rate Mandarin based on what it is: a North American Chinese buffet.  Of course, not everything is going to be the most delicious thing in the world.  I've been going to Mandarin since I was a kid - it has been around forever.  I have very fond memories of birthdays galore at other locations but as I grew up we leaned more towards their takeout as opposed to the buffet itself.  It is a WAY better deal.

The delivery boundaries for this location SUCK.  They won't come south of Bloor - so we have to order and then drive and pick it up.  The food is always fresh and ready almost immediately.  Also, their takeout portions are HUGE.  When my room mate and I order a dinner for 4 and plain soft noodles, we have food for about 3 days.  Also, it reheats well.  And it only costs $35!  For 3 days of lunch and/or dinner!

BUT, if I get one more reusable take out bag and I'm going to freak right out."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this buffet. I always came here when I was a little and always enjoyed it. The mood is very nice and the service is quick and staff are very nice. The variety is great and there are huge selections of hot foods including rice, noodle, vegetable and meat dishes as well as cold side dishes like salads and vegetables. Don't forget the sushi, pizza, soups and bread! The desserts are also to die for. Everything from ice cream to pies to cakes and tarts. There's always fresh fruit as well and everything is delicious! I always love coming!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and am still stuffed 10 hours later. 

Starting out with one spoonfull of every single salad, moving onto the \"chinese\" food, then the \"white\" food, the sushi, then....the dessert. O-M-G

Note please that I am veggie these days and still managed to beyond stuff myself satisfactorily and then some whilst touching zero ex-land creatures (I did however try the 'Torpedo Shrimp' which is probably the best thing I had the entire day, which includes about 15 kinds of dessert). 

I think I put on 5 pounds at lunch alone, I skipped dinner and wanted to nap the rest of the day. 

Oh I cant forget to mention the sushi. I am not a huge sushi person, find it super over-rated and I hate raw fish or any kind of that scary seafood uncooked stuff. They had more veggie sushi options than fishy ones, and they were so scrumptiously awesome...well, for sushi. 
My fav. the yam, they also had inari, avocado, veggie, and many more I didn't have room in my tummy to even look at. 
If you like sushi, there was a surprisingly awesome plethora of options, even for the veggies! 

And the dessert....where do I begin? 
I tried one bite of *almost* every dessert but then I gave up after about 10-15...
SUGARFREE cheesecake (start with this bc after a few bites of the amazing other goodies this will taste like nothing, but I really like that there is a dessert option, however limited, for the diabetics) squares, ice cream...although the flavour options were disappointing, amazing variety of cakes including fudge, cheese, lemon meringuey-style, black forest and god knows what else. There were chocolate dipped marshmallows, bananas dipped in chocolate, eclaires or something that resembled them, mini croissants, waffles!!!!, so many toppings....god you could seriously go there for the dessert alone. 

I love eating, but I don't want to look at food for like...3 days after this. 

But for dinner it's gotten kinda expensive in recent years. Lunch is $12.99 and seniros get 20% off :-) for those of you dining with the wiser ones."}
{"text":"I didn't realise how many calories Chinese food has until I read the menu for Mandarin.  Enough to feed me for a week in one order.  What the hell, I'll do it.  The wings were as deep fried as anything I've ever had and paired very well with the beer I was drinking.  The vegetable spring rolls were not great.  The chow mein wasn't that great either.  The fortune cookies were good and so were the fortunes.  \"You will receive a financial tip which could make you rich.\"  Wait, isn't insider trading illegal?"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery for the second time yesterday. The portions where huge for the price which is great and you can tell is freshly made. Soooo good, got a new regular client!"}
{"text":"Selection is huge but what stands out is the service. They clear off plates very quickly and give fresh napkins as soon as you run out. They are very attentive and I was impressed with my experience there. I enjoyed the Mandarin and would recommend them to anyone for a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"A small group of us went to Mandarin on a Sunday night. If you don't want a 45 minute wait then I would suggest making a reservation as they are very busy. 

I never really hold out much hope about AYCE buffets,  however this buffet was just fine!  AYCE crab legs, YES! But no shell cracking tools, meh! The food is not out of this world or amazing but there are some really good dishes! Spicy chicken was tasty. 

There was a great selection of food, Americanized Chinese food, western food. They had a roast meat station where they were serving roast beef and yorkshire puddings.  That was what really won me over and raised this place from a 3 to a 4 star rating. The beef was cooked perfectly! Good salad bars, sushi bar (I never tried but it looked ok), pizza bar.

The dessert choices are just something else, chocolate covered strawberries and rum truffles were good....red velvet ice cream so tasty!

Eyes bigger than belly syndrome kicked in and I thought I was going to have to roll out of this place.

Atmosphere etc: It is loud, it is busy and some people have no manners! But what do you expect when you come to an AYCE buffet?? The price is right, location is convenient...a stone throw from Yonge and Eglinton subway station. The restaurant is clean and our server was friendly and we did not feel rushed. 

Definitely a must try sort of a place."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to order take out for dinner. We called and ordered our food worth just above $60. After my fiancé had hung up the phone, i came home from work. He had told me he ordered chinese food from Mandarin. I asked if he asked for hot sauce and he said no so I called right back within 5 mins. They said that the maximum number of hot sauce they can give is 5 and additional ones are $0.25. I like lots of hot sauce and that just sounds ridiculous. We argued and argued since our order was over $60 and the woman said no. We asked to speak to the manager and just cancelled our order. We don't like to give business to places like this."}
{"text":"Solid Mandarin location. Annoyed at the more expensive holiday price. Great service."}
{"text":"The food was super good, and there was plenty of it! 
Service was great, we started out with a male server and ended up with a female one, not sure how that happened. Staff was super prompt in taking our used plates away from the table, but not prompt in refilling drinks. 
Obviously the location dictates that it'll end up being super crowded, we went on a Sunday evening around 5, and were able to walk in and sit down, but with a stern warning that we had 1hr 45min to eat. Which was no big deal but a bit weird. By the time we left there was a lengthy wait though. 

They validate parking if you spend more than $30, which is very easy if you have more than just yourself eating here."}
{"text":"All you can eat buffet. Kids love it, but I prefer more authentic chinese, and there is lots of choice in in other parts of the city."}
{"text":"Came by last night for my crab leg fix. This buffet chain continues to serve comfort Chinese Canadian cuisine with friendly service. Decor unchanged with traditional over the top flowers and artifacts and small koi pond but somehow it works. The sushi not great rice too hard but they now have some salmon and tuna sashimi selections. Other dishes remain the same as expected. Standard fruit and dessert station, frozen yogurt and hard scoop ice cream. Could use a few menu updates but overall good place if you want this type of fare. They validate parking. You will be thirsty after your meal."}
{"text":"I wanted to give four stars but the taste just wouldn't allow it. Anyway, I'd heard about Mandarin but didn't really care to pay as much as they want for weekend dinner when I'm usually available. Today it happened that I was free on a weekday at lunch time so I thought I'd give it a go.

The first thing that struck me about the place was the awesome service. I was greeted as soon as I walked in. The hostess who seated me asked if it was my first time and showed me where everything was. My server introduced herself by name and told me to ask if I needed anything at all. Drinks were refilled within seconds and plates were removed so fast I never even noticed it happening. A++.

The food was hit and miss but that's what I expect from a buffet. Being my first time I tried about two bites of every single thing I could find so I'll know what to get next time. All of the fried noodle dishes as well as the fried rice were absolutely void of flavour. They will be skipped next time. Pizza was close to what I make at hope. Was ok but will also be skipped because I can make it myself. Curry chicken was ok. Too much tumeric, though. I dislike being able to taste it, should be used just to color in my opinion. Roast salmon was delicious. Spicy chicken was the best thing I tasted. Lemon chicken was good, not overpowering on the artificial lemon extract like some places. The sauteed beans were also a surprise hit of awesomeness. Egg rolls and spring rolls were both disgusting. The sushi was nice. When I have a free weekday lunch I usually do all you can eat sushi so it was a welcome treat. It was the same as average budget sushi is everywhere else so no major complaints other than the yam maki not being tempura-crispy. The avacado peach maki and the chicken teriyaki maki hit the spot for me. Back to tempura, the vegetables stayed surprisingly crisp on the buffet. I approve. Chicken balls were what I'm used to from the east coast and I haven't seen those since moving to Toronto so I was tickled about that. 

Dessert deserves it's own section because it made my heart sad. When I walked in I wanted to skip the hot stuff and just eat dessert. I'm glad I resisted temptation because it sucked. The sugar-free cheesecake didn't seem to have artificial sweetener either. The carrot cake was at least a week old. The creme caramel was a little curdled. Thankfully the rocky road square was perfect. Also the red velvet cheesecake ice cream was tasty. 

With drink and the ridiculous amount of food listed above it rang in at 17.49. Excellent value considering it's 9 PM and I still haven't needed to eat again. I will definitely go back to Mandarin for lunch. It's not gourmet and it's not \"authentic\" (whatever that means) but there are enough treasures hidden in the feeding trough to make it worth $13."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now with co-workers and it's quite good.  It's not nearly 4stars but I still recommend it for lunch. 

Food: 3/5, it doesn't seem as fresh as the one in oshawa; perhaps it's the crowd but some food seems like it was made the day before and just reheated.  Their black bean beef and other fried foods are however very tasty.  Watch out with some veggies as they can be quite salty.  Their dessert menu is great too.

Service: 4/5, great service, which you can expect from most Mandarins.  The food is taken away quickly and the servers are always smiling and courteous. However, the cleaners look miserable.

Ambience: 3/5, the only fault would be that they should invest in new chairs (very creaky) and better lighting. It feels like having dinner during lunch time.

Price: 3/5, about $20 per person. It can be a little on the pricy end for a lunch."}
{"text":"This Mandarin is the one I usually go to, as it is close to my work and when I have a big time Chinese food craving, the food here hits all the right spots hehe. Service is great, I never have to wait to be seated and the food selection is very good and very tasty every time I go. Never had any problems dining at this location."}
{"text":"So as I was visiting Canada my friends brought me here to try out the food. It was the best buffet I have been to. The best part were the ribs!! They were so delicious. So many options are offered here at the Mandarin! I am definitely going to miss this place! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"OMFG....a place that serves Chinese food where the chicken balls are made of WHITE meat...

I just got home from this place -- for what it is, it's amazing. Crab legs! BBQ ribs! Mussels! Shrimp! Seaweed salad! Even the sushi was decent. 

I signed on, expecting low quality but massive quantity and was extremely surprised to find decent quality -- I'm Asian, and I've had my fair share of dining in Chinese dives and over-priced 5 stars, but this place...for $23.99 (weekend, prime time, crab legs action)...I can't complain. 

They even had no sugar added cappucino ice cream and these amazing chewey chocolate chip cookies. And massive strawberries dipped in chocolate.

There were so many stations, I couldn't even make it to three of them I was so full....sadly I missed out on the made-to-order dessert waffles, the grilled kabob station and the sliced roast beef/prime rib station.

If you want to get your money's worth, stick to the seafood. I sure hope I don't sound like I'm stereotyping my own type, but Chinese who focus on the seafood at these buffets really know how to get their money's worth -- so follow suit! =)

You know it's a good place for Chinese food when you actually see other Chinese people dining there.

Will be back again. Especially on a lazy week night where its about $18.99 and brunch is $16.99"}
{"text":"I can't remember which location I went to but I enjoyed the Chinese buffet.  The food was not greasy, the seafood was fresh.  I have to say this is one of the best Chinese buffet I have been too.  The servers were good at picking up plates and handing out clean napkins."}
{"text":"This is a review for The Mandarin in North York at Yonge/Eglinton. I don't know where to begin. It was the only time I was let down by Mandarin.

This restaurant looks like a 1980s conversion from either a Pizza Hut or Pizza Delight (anyone remember that fuckin place?), or maybe a Kelsey's, Caseys, CC's, Olive Garden, who knows... All I know is the layout for this place is very unnatural and forced. One section looks like it was once a partitioned smoking section. 

As you enter the restaurant, the waiting/reception area is a long narrow and twisty-shaped trainwreck, where staff members also deploy from as if it were a pillbox circa 1942. Gridlocked. Who designed this?

As you enter from the mall, all the CCTV screens are immediately to the left and some patrons are monitored on video. A humungus fat guy was headlining the show as we entered, and staff had him on 3 different camera angles while he ate. All of the security/dining room monitors are on display for everybody to watch while they are waiting for their tables. Very strange thing to see. Why not turn the monitor around so it is viewable only to staff members from behind the counter? Maybe to let you know that you will be timed/monitored during the duration of your visit. Who knows, but it was pretty bizzarro stuff to see first thing when you walk in. While we waited for our seat the cameras were all over this one guy in particular, who literally weighed about 500 fucking pounds, his head was the size of a tire from a Toyota Tercel.

After a relatively short wait (5 to 7 minutes) we were led to our table, which happened to be situated one table over from the humongous fat ass previously mentioned. 

Upon being seated, we ordered coffee then went to the buffet. The buffet is a little smaller than other Mandarins that I have been to, but overall it was fine. My only problem with the buffet was all the riff-raff waddling all over the place. I'm no elitist, but Jesus Christ it's like a Wal-Mart was next door. Pants hanging down lower than people's asses, jogging pants, sports shit/human billboards, bling phones, and a rabbit hole of various other societal devolution. 

We stayed for about 50 minutes, ate 2 or 3 plates. The fat motherfucker next to us literally made about 8-10 trips to the buffet in the time we were sitting and when we did leave, he didn't seem to be finishing anytime soon. It was hard to watch. Down right fucking disgusting actually. 

The coffee we ordered never arrived. No waitress was available until the time we were ready to pay the bill. 

The place was kind of dirty, the tables and the walls were disgusting. The table cloth had crumbs and cumstains all over it when we were seated. The wall that the two-seater table was butted up against had what looked to be vaginal croutons all over it. It was disgusting and I don't know how staff cannot use a J-cloth and wipe the wall beside the table. It was obviously contaminated. It looked like many days worth of spray/discharge/debris. I don't know how management cannot see the walls are coated with vaginal croutons and streaks of mystery fluid.

Parking is also not free, but that is life in the city sometimes and can't really blame Mandarin for that. 

For a better Mandarin experience you will probably want to visit the one in Burlington or Brampton. Those 2 are A+ in both service, building layout, and general buffet satisfaction.

I don't think I would go back to the Mandarin at Yonge and Eglinton unless I was totally shitfaced and/or drugged/kidnapped.

I am disappointed that I had to leave a disappointing review of a Manadarin location and feel like something has gone very wrong in the world."}
{"text":"Usually Mandarin's have elaborate fishtanks and are actually quite beautiful inside. This one is kind of in a mall so it lacks the ambiance of other locations, but it did have really awesome food. I actually forgot how good this buffet is and I could not get enough of the garlic broccoli, the curry chicken, or the rum-soaked mango bevvies. Our server Yan was really nice and personable, and she made sure we got hot napkins before and after our meals (one of the best parts about mandarin if you ask me!). The staff continually replenished items so everything was fresh. Also, this location had a ton of dessert options, including a frozen yogurt machine and a waffle machine with chocolate waffles. Definitely go here on an empty stomach, but do exercise some control. There are so many options it's easy to overdo it."}
{"text":"Good old Mandarin buffet... We were here for the birthday promo, a free meal with 3 or more guests. You also get a cupcake and fridge magnet picture. (regularly for weekend lunch $19.99).

- Same old same chinese food
- I always go for the classic torpedo shrimp
- The sushi is not so great (not recommended)
- They have seafood - mussels, shrimp, fish
- A good dessert selection - cake, pudding,  fruit, waffle station, cookies, icecream and froyo soft-serve machine
I got cotton candy! This made me happy.

It's Mandarin, a place for everyone. Especially kids and old people.
Great birthday. My friend received a little candle to blow out and fridge magnet with an instant photo taken there."}
{"text":"The food here is good. I like how you can serve yourself. There are so many options. I enjoyed the sushi rolls, the Singapore Noodles, the ribs, glazed salmon, the ice cream, the fruit the jello and the cakes, the red velvet cake was good. My server was also very nice and charming. They are very efficient with clearing your dirty dishes. You have to come very hungry because you'll get full fast. This is one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Speed read
1) I am very thirsty after having dinner there
2) shrimp is good
3) good service
4) crab leg is not very good.  Especially the hot one.  Cold one are actually better.  I believe they ruined the crab leg
5) almost $40 per person, definitely not worth it.

I went there for a birthday party t friends.  Food to price pairs for is not worth it.  There's better place to spend $40.

Good service.

The shrimp texture is very good.  Bouncy ( not sure if it's the right word).  Both cold and hot shrimps are good."}
{"text":"Excuse my profanity, but HOLY SHIT THIS PLACE SUCKS. I don't know if it's the lack of good buffets in Toronto but coming from Chicago/Detroit this place is pathetic. Are Canadians swayed by the tacky and glittery decor and questionabley polite Chinese servers? Yes they have crab, but they're tiny. Their sushi variety is a joke. Their hot entrees are a joke as well. I am crying in my seat knowing that my parents and I just drove 4 hours from Michigan and wasted $100 on this place. Save your money and no need for AYCE if it's this bad and expensive. Just go to Chinatown. If you continue to come here and enjoy it here you're just being played by the buffet system because there's no chance you could even eat 50% of the price-if you can even stomach more than one plate of deplorable food from this place."}
{"text":"The Mandarin has, by far, the BEST wait staff in Toronto. They attend to every single need. The food is absolutely delicious. On the Saturday that I went, they had endless crab legs. Definitely go with an appetite because you will want to try everything. I also noticed that the sushi has improved - they have a lot more variety. The Mandarin is celebrating Chinese New Year, so there are many specialty dishes being offered during this time of year."}
{"text":"Super Lecker war es hier. Ich habe in Toronto gelebt und meine Studienkollegen haben mich hier her ausgeführt. Ich fands super. Das Buffet ist der Hammer. Alles sehr lecker. Man bekommt Leitungswasser bis zum abwinken - wer nicht auf Chlorgeschmack steht, sollte sich ein Getränk in der Fl bestellen. 
Auf jeden Fall ein Besuch wert!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at a number of Mandarin's but really enjoyed the variety at this one.

If you are enjoying with people that do or don't like Chinese food, it is great for all diners in your group as you are sure to find something for everyone here!

There is dim sum, sushi, hot table with roast and mashed potatoes, lots of different kinds of seafood, soup, salad, side dishes -- great asian ribs, spicy chicken, asian noodle dishes and of course, desserts.  They even have a frozen yogurt machine with fresh fruit toppings.

Very handy to the Famous Players theatre too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Toronto this weekend from Windsor for a raptors game. I've always wanted to give this buffet a try every time I've come to Toronto but never got the chance to. We decide to go here not thinking about what time it was and what day it was - Saturday 6pm. We put our names down and they say they'll call in 45 min. As we are waiting, the front area turns into a complete zoo. People everywhere. It was pretty overwhelming. I was about to give up and go to the keg across the street but my husband was complaining that he wanted to stuff himself so we wait. I'm glad we did!! After 1.15 hrs we finally get seated. 

It was the end of dim sum fest so we got some really cool items apart of the buffet. I also didn't know they served crab legs, that was a bonus. I was actually shocked at how good the food was for a Chinese buffet. Everything I had was delicious. Best creme brûlée I've ever had, yeah I said it! Was so good, I finished my husbands lol. They also had egg tarts, one of my favs. 

The manager came by and spoke with us as we came in, extremely friendly. Our servers name was Yi and he was very friendly and prompt as well. In fact, everyone who worked there was great from the manager to the girl filing our water cups.

The only thing that grossed me out were the bathrooms but in a busy place like that I guess it's expected?"}
{"text":"Large and reasonable buffet, but hardly any real Chinese dishes and most of the Chinese dishes there are involve breading and deep frying.  The first time I was here I has diarrhea for two days; since I was with a group and no one else complained, I was able to trace it by interviewing people about what they ate to the mussels.  Avoid them.

Cocktail shrimp are nice here, and it is worth filling up on them to get the most expensive item for you money.  I don't trust the sushi on a buffet and have avoided it.

Staff is very friendy as other reviewers mentioned.  Because the place is so busy and so friendly - and because of the yuppie digs in which this particular one is located - a lot of rude and spoiled brats are usually running around unsupervised by Mr. and Mrs. Yuppieparent.  Last time I was run into twice and nearly knocked over."}
{"text":"There isn't much that I can add to the excellent reviews here already. However, don't eat for about two days before going to this place :-)"}
{"text":"The service is pretty good and they were friendly to my Filipino family! They serve more than the ordinary Chinese food. The butter tart is to die for!!"}
{"text":"O.MY.G...!!!!
who would give this FABULOUS buffet less than 5 stars?!!!!!!
I mean... you can eat till your stomach really get in pain and you just cant stop eating more!!!"}
{"text":"You don't come to the Mandarin for the food.      You come because you want to completely gorge yourself senseless.   It's self-immolation.  You're trying to hurt yourself, most likely to subconsciously prove a point.

It's amazing that this gluttonous slopfest actually has a \"sugarfree cheesecake\" option for the diabetics.    Perhaps it's because almost all of their frequent patrons will come down with the chronic condition and they're trying to proactively acclimatize folk to the future.   It's hard to say.

While waiting in the feed line for dollops of trollop, I came to the instant realization that it's hard to fault this place for being exactly as advertised.    I mean, it's not exactly fair to compare this to Toronto's culinary hotspots.   That's like comparing apples to buckets of MSG-infused gravy.

Everything ran smoothly.  The food was always plentiful, and empty plates disappeared faster than you could say \"vomit soaked food coma\".

Hey, at least no one died."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

I've only been to Mandarin a total of three times in my life. Sad, eh? Well I always find Mandarin to be a westernized Chinese buffet location, and my visit last week certainly didn't change my view on this chain brand.

I was definitely impressed with the service, and in fact I think they overdid it. Every time I used the napkin to wipe my mouth, they immediately gave me a new one. Okay? Thanks, but I can usually make a napkin last a few rounds.

The food for lunch buffet wasn't anything special, and as I mentioned: Westernized Chinese cuisine. They do have quite good variety though, such as sashimi, sushi, rolls, torpedo shrimp, mussels, noodles, rice, etc. The dessert variety was also quite good, with yogurt, ice cream, and fruits aplenty. In fact the dessert was probably the highlight of my meal, as the yogurt and ice cream tasted very delicious!

At the end I'm still not a Mandarin fan, but for those who want to experience mass Asian food without going to an actual Asian restaurant (I don't know why), Mandarin is certainly not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Once again, we enter the realm of \"I wish I could half star this\".  Because I'm not 100% sure if the Mandarin, one of the fine captains of the sit down and gorge buffet chain, deserve four stars.  But I follow the same rule with stars that I do with tipping: if you think you've given too much, you probably have given enough. 

I go to this particular Mandarin exactly once a year, for a dinner party thrown by a friend. Yes, yes, we go to Chinese buffet for a dinner party.  That's how she rolls.  

Anyway, my trips here have been an ongoing education.  Each year, I learn how much I can eat at a time.  How many plates I can consume, how fast I can scarf them down.  

And now, I can finish dinner and not be pleading for the sweet release of death.

The food is tasty enough.  You can get a variety of Chinese-Canadian dishes.  

There's a wonderful ambiance to be had there on a Saturday night.  Large groups celebrating something or another, small parties, bridal showers carb loading before the festivities, it's all quite something to see."}
{"text":"This was actually better than I expected it would be.  It is a huge place (the different rooms are labelled so that you don't get lost trying to get back to your table), and the food is constantly refilled.  The service was prompt and efficient - our dirty plates were taken away almost instantly.

I would say the food quality here is average, but the beauty is in the variety.  I can't even begin to remember all the things that I sampled but it included hot and sour soup, crab legs (special for the holidays I think), torpedo shrimp, spare ribs, lots of stir-fried veggies, mussels with cheese, salmon, dumplings, and curry chicken.  Same thing with dessert - nothing that I tried was absolutely amazing but I did enjoy the cherry cheesecake, lemon meringue pie, mango pudding, nanaimo bars, and the waffles (with a variety of fruit toppings).  There is also a salad bar, a sushi section, and a section of french fries, pizza, roast beef, mashed potatoes, etc.

I've heard that there can be long waits for tables, especially on weekends, so a reservation would be a good idea.  $23.99 for dinner on the weekends (and on holidays, and during the entire Christmas season).  While the food quality here doesn't quite stand up to some of the best buffets in Vegas, it's not a bad substitute."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you are getting at the buffet.
Everything basically tastes same as they are mostly coated with the same sauces.
They don't exchange the food sometimes even though no one is taking it because the food got too dry from being left out long."}
{"text":"Got treated to a lunch here, was very satisfied! The food was awesome and the service was great. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Moon festival. Good food. Good service. Lots of choice. Go hungry or don't bother. We enjoyed and woke up wanting leftovers. Lol. No doggie bags allowed though."}
{"text":"We were recently at Mandarin at Eglinton and Yonge to celebrate our Mom's birthday. She always loved that location and enjoyed every bite of food there. Everything was festive for the Chinese New Year and we tried four plates of food before ending with the ice cream and some Nanaimo bars. I wish they had the chocolate covered strawberries they have in the summer but considering it was winter... 

The hot and sour soup was wonderful, not too spicy and I am a spice wimp. We even tried the Thousand Year Old Egg Salad which was quite exotic and fascinating. Not my favourite thing on the menu but I have never had anything quite like it. For the New Year they also has dumplings which were very good.

I have had sushi there before that was quite good but this time it was just OK. Focus on the Chinese food and you will be fine. I loved trying a little bit of everything as usual at Mandarin and maybe we will go back for Mother's Day this year too.

{"text":"Let me start off by saying when I go to the Mandarin, I am not expecting the greatest quality food. I am expecting chinese take out quality, and a hell of a lot of dessert. Oh and soup and salad to make me feel better about my over indulgence. I also expect to spend the rest of the evening on the couch or in bed, hating myself and planning my visit to the gym in the AM. This is why I go once a year, at most, but people: do NOT go to the Mandarin before a night out of drinking. I have so many friends who do this, and while it seems like a good idea, it never turns out well. 

The Mandarin (not just this location) has the friendliest staff ever. Really, if it weren't for the staff and excellent service, I wouldn't return. I'm not big on buffets but it is always nice to go somewhere where there is truly food for everyone (pizza, sushi, roast beef, yorkshire pudding, even a full turkey dinner around thanksgiving) and I'm telling you, the staff always put a smile on my face! 

Avoid this (and any Mandarin) like the plague on holidays though. The wait to get seated is crazy."}
{"text":"I think value is still there if you are a fatso but the food aaaaaaarrrrrrgggggg the food.. and dada I am going to reveal a big secret here... the time has arrived... all will be known............ I think I have figured out why the food at Mandarin is tasteless Across The Board. They cook the food and boil everything in water to heat it up just prior to serving. That makes everything completely bland, tasteless, FLAVOURLESS and neutral.
The fish tastes like the chicken tastes like the sprout tastes like the rice tastes like the cake.
The most flavourful thing was the fortune cookie.
No, a really tasteless affair"}
{"text":"Very clean and great service! We enjoyed the food tonight it was my first personal experience here and I highly recommend this place! Come hungry my friends and you will be happy!"}
{"text":"If I were to compose a list of things I miss most about the GTA, the Mandarin would be in the top 10.  Maybe 5.

I have been to three different locations in my life, and every one of them aims to please.  This location is no different.  The staff is very welcoming, polite, and attentive.  My glass of water never went half full.  And of course, the selection of food is large, piping hot, and presented well.  Not bad for a lunch buffet!  This location has a lot of usual customers - the hostess greeted several of them by name.

I don't know why the reviews are so divided about this place - you guys haven't tried the crap here in Ottawa.  Since I have lived away from southern Ontario, I haven't been to a Chinese buffet that even comes close to Mandarin quality.  I am sooooooo excited that they're finally opening one in Ottawa!"}
{"text":"Went there on my BD. Was fun, lots of choices. I really like all the salads and shrimp too."}
{"text":"Ordered take out... When did chinese food = bean sprouts???!! It was terrible, absolutely terrible! I would not in anyway order from there again... Unless under inescapable duress.


If I check in here, then I'm here against my will, please come help me!!"}
{"text":"Can I give this place a 0 star?  I would if I could!  It's gross!  Please note: Mandarin is not authentic Chinese food!  It's Westernize Chinese food and most of what they serve you will not be able to find it in China. They also don't take care of the quality of their food because it's a buffet!  You are paying so much money too!  Save it and head up to Markham.  Much better choices and options if you want real Chinese food. Just so you know most Chinese will not go to Mandarin...the only reason why I went was bc it was a work function."}
{"text":"Crab legs on the weekend here had me shooting stars or shitting Mars bars looking... Yeah you get it! 

But the point is, we all have the once in while desire to stuff our faces silly and days you can't decide between Chinese food, pizza and sushi? We've got Mandarin as a blender of concoction ready to fill you up for as long as you can withstand belching and the after effects of over eating.

Free parking validation, 3rd floor located on the street west of the resto.
At the entrance, pass the theaters on your left, down a flight of escalators, turn right!! 
TADA! That was your warm up to a speedy ticket to overindulging!!

Lots of selection during dinner. I concentrated really hard on saving room for dessert, but of course had it mid course to abstain from the grease. Good enough is good enough."}
{"text":"The restaurant gets 3 stars from me only because of the atmosphere and wait staff. It is pretty interesting inside, and the wait staff are extremely pleasant and continuously refill napkins, water, and clear your tables each time you get up to the buffet. 

The food however, is pretty bland. By the end of your meal all you will feel on your tongue is the leftover feeling of grease and salt. (But at least there's a dessert section if you still have room :3).

Now talking about the price... AVOID Weekend nights at ALL COSTS because they will empty your pockets. A dinner for 2 with 15% tip was 80$, and trust me you can get much better food elsewhere... and lots of it for EIGHTY DOLLARS. Good location if you want to organize a work  event or something, otherwise go somewhere else or come back weekday lunch hours if you wanna piggy. (I suggest just ordering a ton of food somewhere and eating at home if you want the latter option)"}
{"text":"Not the best location. I once found one of the pot lights in the ice cream, it fell from above..how bad is that? I asked if it was extra charge or included with the buffet...I demanded the entire thing to be thrown out due to broken glass!"}
{"text":"This buffet was nice but felt a little dry- I understand that a buffet should have a good variety  of food and that it can be hard to keep up dish quality (we came around 7:45 which might be later than the usual time for dinner) but many things looked too dry or soaked to eat. Some of the fried meat had semi-jerkified when I tried it. Their salad bar was lacking as well- only some torn up iceberg lettuce with an average amount of toppings. The desserts were pretty nice though- they have quite a few choices from mango pudding to creme brûlée. I've had worse, so I might come back if others want to go."}
{"text":"Over priced average food. They only validate for parking in their building during Dinner, not Lunch. To add insult to injury, they have the nerve to give you a time limit for a buffet. It's like telling people to just give them money and go. Thankfully they didn't try to kick me out after the time limit as I've hear they've done to other people. Nice servers but don't recommend"}
{"text":"Ugh. The quality of food at this Mandarin has gone down, down, down. I've been here before, years back. It was never this bad. I don't know if it's because we came at the tail end of lunch or what. But after we ate we both felt sick. Won't be eating here again!"}
{"text":"I have noticed a lot of snarky comments about Mandarin being a place to stuff yourself, and I am dismayed, as I have been coming to various Mandarin restaurants all over the GTA for years, and never had a bad meal.  What they offer is choice, and a lot of it, and all the staff strive SO hard to be polite and helpful. But despite it being a chain, the menu varies somewhat in each restaurant, reflecting local tastes.   This  busy Mandarin location makes the best creme brulee of any of their locations. Believe it or not, it's not supposed to taste like sugar topped scrambled eggs! So kudos to the Yonge and Eg location for getting the creme brulee recipe right. Generally they are one of the best quality Mandarins around. I just want to express one frustration about Mandarin, though: 99 % of the male staff at the carving table have NO idea what you mean when you ask them to slice the meat THINLY. They look at you blankly and give you slices thick enough to choke. OK, I know this is hardly a Chinese dish, but carving a roast is hardly rocket science. That's the main reason I give 3 stars, not 4 stars."}
{"text":"The only reason we go to Mandarin is for their Crab Leg Festival. The amount of crab legs my love can shuffle down his throat would have left our bank account overdrawn if purchased at market prices (I actually checked that). The crab legs are always top notch fresh, lightly salted, and pre-cut, and although I don't get into the messy business of getting them out of their shells, my other half says it is very easy as he proceeds to unshell the fifth plate of the evening. As for everything else in this buffet, it is average or even below average. I don't like a single salad from the bar, they are mainly bland and boring. The soups are Ok with 3-4 to choose from including favourites like Won Ton and Hot and Sour and perhaps a chowder or other cream soup  depending on your luck. There is no Peking Duck at Mandarin, I really don't know why, as it really seems to be a staple of other buffets, guess they dared to be different, not in a good way though. They offer roast beef which is again bland bland bland. The selection from the hot table is standard with fried foods and some of the familiar to the white men Chinese dishes, all incredibly westernized. Sushi are just plain wrong, I mean chicken with peach roll? what is that? French take on Japanese cuisine? No sashimi either.
The desserts are plentiful but nothing to stand out really.  When ordering tea ask for one tea bag, or you will get two overpowering tea bags in a small pot, for which you'll be charged.

Other than that service is uber friendly, fast and efficient. At dinner they validate your parking ticket, but not for lunch. 
Overall as I said, crab legs are the only thing that keeps this place on my list."}
{"text":"FOOD: 

CON: Tastes so ordinary. The variety of food is not that good. Most of the food here are fried, I saw only one noodle dish, and few dim sum. 


PRICE:

CON: Expensive! (You expect more from a  $30/head buffet)


OVERALL:

CON: Worst buffet ever! Way too pricey and the food was just okay. You pay around $30 per person and the food you get is so disappointing. Not going back here."}
{"text":"To me, a great dining experience is defined by the combination of taste, value, atmosphere and service. I didn't arrive at Mandarin for inventive Asian food, I came to be glutinous.

Its been over 15 years since I last dined at Mandarin, but what I found upon arrival brought joyful tears to my eyes. Families, couples, friends; talking, dining, drinking, being happy in the simplest of ways. There are few things that bring humans together as Mandarin does, because lets face it, an unlimited buffet spanning multiple ethnic cuisines forms the basis for what makes our society the greatest in the world.

Service: Mandarin has some of the most well educated and attentive servers in the entire Toronto restaurant industry, hipster servers working downtown take note, and pray they dont come after you. Our server kindly introduced herself while distributing hot towels, took the time to explain the restaurants deep roots and origins as well as the menu available to us. She quickly took our drink orders and was back in a flash with our drinks.

Food: To say that mandrain is pushing the envelope of a Chinese buffet would be subdued, while the overall menu is meant to please the massses, one finds gems amongst the hoard. Fresh ontario blueberry frozen yogurt? yes please. Unlimited fresh crab fridays and saturdays? yes please.

I want to highlight the service here in particular Myles, the managing partner of this location. Once we realized crab was a buffet item, we understandably set our eyes on devouring as much of it as we possibly could, considerate of the fact that we might be asked to stop and or leave. Myles noticed us fumbling with crab legs and introduced himself kindly, we thought it was a ploy to get us to stop eating so much crab but rather he was concerned that we were not benefitting enough from the crab offering and proceeded to deliver us a heaping plate of crab legs, then carefully instructed us on the appropriate way to de-bone the crab to yield the most meat from each leg. A complete stand out.

Later, I found Myles giving new mandarin devotee's a thorough tour of the restaurant.

I cant think of anywhere else id rather be on a Friday or Saturday evening. Thank you Mandarin."}
{"text":"This location has really gone downhill. The quality of the food used to be much better but they are not as busy as they used to be. The staff is friendly and attentive but the food is not very flavourful and most of the dishes do not look very appetizing. The Singapore noodles had no flavour to them and were in fact quite watery. The corned beef (because they had no roast beef at lunch) was really salty and extremely chewy. I am not coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I've never been a fan of buffets. There is something unnatural about food that has been sitting there for god knows how long, being touched by anyone who walks by. 

My issue with the Mandarin is not so much that it is a buffet, but the fact that you are paying so much to eat there. I understand that eating until you burst is what draws people to a buffet, but would you really want to pay so much to stuff yourself with generic food? Toronto has great Asian restaurants, and most of them are pretty cheap. What is the appeal of the Mandarin?

I can imagine people keep going to the Mandarin because they like to sample everything they offer. And trust me, they offer a lot. With so many options,  you are bound to find something you like.

And now that my biases are out of the way, I can begin my review. I went for lunch. The place was packed as usual. The service was pretty slow. As soon as we got our drinks, we headed to the buffet. I sampled a little bit of everything. The food was warm, but I never found any dish that I loved. The person I was with said this particular location was no good, and that other locations were much better. I'm gonna have to agree. I recently went to the Oakville location, and the food was a thousand times better.

Give it a try if you are into buffets. If you are not sure, then avoid at all costs."}

It has essentially everything you can think of it crave for a all inclusive dinner. We have went there for birthdays, dinners and even Christmas and haven't been disappointed. 

I would suggest making a reservation as the wait can be pretty long at points."}
{"text":"I have been to many mandarin locations, and this is by far the best one. Parking is very convenient, especially for a restaurant located on Yonge street. The food is very good, crab legs are must try if you come for dinner on the weekends. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"That's one more Mandarin buffet lunch under my belt...heh, heh.
The ROMEOs (Retired Old Men Eating Out) met there for lunch again today.
It never disappoints.  Always bright, friendly torpedo shrimp...I mean 
waitresses.  Penny was particularly nice, she used my iPad to take our pictures.  Did I mention the sweet and sour waitresses?  No, sorry, I mean chicken balls. The staff are all sweet and the food is always wonderful.
     See you again when someone else has a birthday."}
