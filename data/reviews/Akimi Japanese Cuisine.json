{"text":"This ayce sushi restaurant is only getting a 2 stars from me because the service is very poor. I have been here a couple times for dinner and I have noticed that they are always understaffed. 

This restaurant has the ipad ordering menu which is nice, but every time I have visited they have always messed up my orders. Whether it is missing or wrong orders. The last time I came here for ayce with my friend we ordered 3 sushi rolls and had waited almost 30 minutes and still didn't come out. I had to ask the waiter who then told the sushi chef. Then I saw the same waiter change into a chef uniform to help make the rolls. 

Although service is poor, the food is pretty good. One of my favorites is the torched salmon and butter fish sushi. Not sure if I would come back again though."}
{"text":"Don't come this place. Waste your time!!!

I understand I shouldn't have any expectation for AYCE place. But this is the worst experience I ever had. If possible, I rather give ZERO instead of 1 star. They worth nothing!!!!!

It was a Monday night, We ordered the sashimi right we sat down, but it served after an hour!!!!!! The fish is not fresh and watery. I asked the servers 3-4 times in order for our first sashimi came. 

The service is horrible and they are short of staff. It is like a family business which the father, son and grandson all came out to serve you.  They may try their best already but with this quality of food and service, I doubt how would they survive!!

Don't waste your time, I rather eat the $1.50 Costco hot dog right across the street!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to quickly have a miso soup and salmon avocado roll. The miso soup tasted sweet. Who gets miso soup wrong? The roll was small, flavorless, and the salmon looked pale and low quality. The place smelled like a public bathroom, probably because of the draft from the bathroom. We got fortune cookies with our bill, which was odd. We ordered off of the a la carte menu, but it felt like we got awful all you can eat items."}
{"text":"This is good sushi restaurants. It have a lot item to order. The salmon fish is fresh. rocking roll is best sushi roll."}
{"text":"Very typical AYCE Japanese restaurant.  From service to quality of food to selection, pretty much at par with other similar restaurants.  So do not expect anything spectacular.  

Food items that I like today: yellow dragon roll (actually tastes quite nice with mango on top), grilled eggplant, salmon belly (surprisingly well done)

A-ok: ramen, chicken wings, eel hand roll, coconut pudding

Not-so-good: udon, all the beef dishes (too \"chewy\"), sushi, chicken teriyaki, salmon teriyaki

Weekend lunch is $17.99.  Includes one drink."}
{"text":"You order on an iPad but the ordering app is sluggish and clearly not optimized (sorry but as a Comp sci graduate this irks me). Of course, the place is all you can eat.

Sushi itself tastes good, the speed wasn't fantastic but it wasn't horrible either given how busy it was. There's a fair amount of selection as well, I enjoyed it thoroughly. The value you get here seems to be pretty good. Overall, can't complain about much.

-1 app is slow af"}
{"text":"Wow $18 for this! 
What an amazing deal, very good sushi and sashimi.

Of course it's not as good as high end Japanese sushi restaurant but it's one of the best Japanese buffet restaurants that does takeout. I am sure their all you can eat sushi is even better. 

One thing is the amount of rice they use is a little bit too little. I know most people like this, which is why I am still giving them 5 stars. I would rather have more rice to help get full without having to finish the whole sushi tray. However the amount of sushi you get is so much that it is not required but would be a preference since this is even more than their all you can eat price. 

Still very good, no complaints. No fishy taste and fresh fish. Rice is fresh and not hard. Extremely good for the price. Also they give a lot of soy sauce. 

One thing, get extra chopsticks. One chopstick I got was broken. Luckily they gave me 2. But it's okay because I'm chinese and have a ton."}
{"text":"OK EVERYONE LISTEN UP. 

SOOOOO it was national cheese day a couple of days ago and so I was craving cheese wontons for the whole week. Decided to purchase Akimi's cheese wontons to satisfy this craving. Long story short, I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. As you can see, there was no cheese only wonton. I did not pay $6 for fried batter. So sad, all I want are some CHEESY WONTONS!!! 

Okay I also ordered the yam tempura roll which was delicious and the salmon lovers. Cuts of salmon were extremely tiny, for both sashimi and sushi. Very dissapointed."}
{"text":"Their sashimi came 1 hour later (despite asking for them many times). They only came out with other orders (although very slowly as well). I think their tactic was to stuff your stomach with carbs and then the sashimi arrived. Most places will serve their sashimi first. Would not come here again. There are much better choices in markham. 2 stars only because quality of food isn't bad."}
{"text":"Got a salmon bento box, salmon was paper thin (see attached picture)

Tempura was soggy by the time we got home because they failed to puncture the box to prevent it from getting soggy. Amateurs ..."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed this restaurant. The last time I was there I found servers/ owners to be rude. We were a table of four. One of our guests came a few minutes after us. Half way through our meal she screamed that it was \"last call for you guys\". It was pretty embarrassing, especially because we didn't order that much food. 
The food is decent. But I don't appreciate the food being shoved in front of my face while they're putting it down for us. 
This experience was pretty horrendous and will definitely reconsider my next visit and take my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It has some special rolls that you wouldn't find anywhere else, otherwise. Their picked ginger roll and special seaweed sushi is worth trying!! It has good vegetarian options, as well as lots of non veg and sushi!
The staff isn't the friendliest, but good thing we have iPads to order all you can eat!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to try out a new sushi place and we are very glad we choose Akimi! The food was exceptional and fresh. Service was wonderful and the people here are very pleasant! We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Good selection of sushi, one of the best in Vaughn i would say. Especially for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"To be honest, there aren't that many spectacular all you can eat sushi places in Richmond Hill. But this one is closer to the top if I were to rate them all. The service is typical, and the sushi is good. I've never had the problem with the sushi or any of the food. You get to order on an iPad so that's always cool. I suggest you try it to see how you like it co pared to other Ayce sushi places in rhill."}
{"text":"This place used to be Kaze, but I guess they changed name and management. The interior looks the same, exactly the same. The things that have changed are the plates and soy sauce dish (I think) lol!

Coming here tonight made me realize I have another pet peeve - soy sauce dishes with 3 legs. Boy was I pissed tonight.. I thought their slow service was bad already, but the dish totally pissed me to a whole new level. I have never had a dish with 3 legs. The balance of the dish totally blows. I dip my sushi in it and it tips to one side. I spilled the sauce couple times and it was only the beginning of the night - annoyed beyond all measure. As for service, it was unbelievably slow. I would understand if I was at a 5 star restaurant because they need to cook my food to perfection. But it's AYCE, they're not perfecting anything except for stuffing customers faces! If I were running this place, the first thing I would work on is the speed. Perhaps I should endow on them the Speed Force LOL.

On a positive note, the food was decent. Quality isn't the priority I look for in a AYCE place, so I won't be hard on them for this. Food was passable for sure, not great. If you're looking to stuff your face, feel free to come in a group! It'll be better to have friends with you to keep you company since it's so slow.

Took off 3 stars for slow service and ridiculous choice of soy sauce dish. I would rather have a practical dish over something flashy."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to take me to this place really badly so I agreed to go. We went for dinner on a Friday, for All you can eat, around $35+ seems expensive for the quality of food you receive. The sushi is subpar, nothing amazing. The rolls have too much rice, not enough fish. The staff are nice. The service is great. I probably will not recommend this place simply because of the price."}
{"text":"WOW ---- all you can eat lunch for $15.00 just what we wanted for a Saturday Sister lunch. 
The restaurant is new (February 2015), and the have a nice relaxing modern design going on with a large sushi bar and about 8 really large booths for big groups and about 10 other tables. Good size place 
The menu is either a la carte or all you can eat. Ordering on an iPad was wonderful, so so easy 
We ordered a large number of items to check it all all - tempura; pumpkin, yam, shrimp (all types were fantastic), grilled eggplant (yummy), chicken teriyaki, seafood ramen (was just ok), salmon hand rolls (yum), aged tofu (too mushy)...the salmon avocado rolls were wonderful.....the California rolls lacked some flavour. 
All in all, we will come back here !!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on a sunday for a birthday dinner. and first impressions were not good. this restaurant they set the table limit at 1 and a half hour, whereas almost every japanese ayce buffet, does 2 hours. 

When we did order the food took a long time to arrive, and we noticed the higher priced items such as sashimi either took a long time or never arrived and required us to manually ask the server to give it to us. The Tablet menu should've been efficent but they were constantly missing out on orders and such. The one thing good about this restaurant is the food is truly made to order, at least the fried food. since almost all the friend food they do, is fresh hot. and is not bad. However a lot of the sashmi,. and sushi rolls. were definitely not up to par, as the fish is not that fresh, and they seem to love to stack on the rice for all the sushi in an effort to make you full. 

Overall the desert as well. outside of ice cream which of course is regular. the rest of the desert is nothing to be proud about. the jello has too much gelatine. which made it hard as candy. and nothing that stands out. 

overall int he markham/richmond hill area there are plenty of japanese AYCE and a lot of good ones actually. so goign this far for this one seems a stretch for anyone. and i would probably not go out of my way to come here, unless i live locally and have no choice"}
{"text":"My rating would be more of a 3.5 but I rounded up to a 4 since I do go here somewhat frequently as it is close to my work for lunch. 

I noticed some reviews staying the staff here are rude, but I've had the opposite experience my entire time coming here. Yes some of them don't speak English that great, but as far as service goes I've gotten pretty good service. Examples include showing up close to closing time but they still took my take out order. Or they got one of my handrolls wrong in my takeout order, and I only noticed when I got home but next time I went they gave me a free hand roll. 

I often come here for AYCE lunch and it is very fairly priced. After tax and tip your looking close to $20 which is decent. As you can expect the actual sashimi on the sushi is a little thinner than more expensive a la carte places, but it's all you can eat and they don't pack everything with rice as bad as some places I've been too. Also their other dishes are very good, like their chicken dishes. 

Food comes out at a pretty quick pace. You order on an iPad here as well and it doesn't require the server to come over to verify it before the order goes in like some places. 

Overall I'm pretty happy with this place for value and service. Its not the best sushi in the world but it's a good place for a quick fix."}
{"text":"Food is ok but the server got no smile at all. Black face all night & I don't understand how can she put the fresh dishes from kitchen & the dirty dishes which she collected from customers table on the same tray ?!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday. Great interior - spacious and clean. The iPad needed some serious update/rework. It works, but extremely sluggish and slow. The UI/UX also wasn't the best. 

Our food were delivered very quickly. They tasted great and were quite exactly of what one would expect from a Japanese AYCE restaurant. The waitress and waiters were very kind and quick with our requests. Very impressive variety of food to choose from. For the price ($26 for Sunday dinner) we were quite satisfied with the menu. Overall it was a fine experience for us. We will likely return again."}
{"text":"Good AYCE place near Costco if you're hungry for sushi after \"shopping\"

Good quality stuff, fair pricing and fresh. Not poorly crafted like the other Markham/Richmond Hill restaurants. Just off 404, not bad for selection (big menu) and lots of items to choose from. Apparently they've been open for 6 years, and they're pretty solid but they've recently rebranded and added the ipad ordering."}
{"text":"I have eaten at so many AYCE sushi restaurants that I have learned not to have high expectation.  In other words, most AYCE restaurants earn a 3-star/OK rating from me.  Akimi does not.  It does not because the fish fillets on the sushi were too thin and the rice was too big; I cut all the rice in half.  Some of the sashimi were fresh, but the salmon was not (yeah, this was odd).  The grilled eggplant was barely pan fried, almost raw.  The seafood stir fried noodle was meh.  The saving graces were the maki rolls, the butter mushroom, and the seaweed salad.  They were good.

The venue is nicely decorated.  The restaurant uses iPad for ordering which is very helpful.  I hope Akimi can get the words out that they are new in business.  Hopefully, they would have more profit to improve the quality of the offering.

2.5 stars for now."}
{"text":"It was my first time going. 
I really liked the tempura sauce. It tasted amazing with everything. Sushi, chicken etc. taste amazing with the tempura sauce. 
Staff are nice and the chefs are amazing at making the food. The reason why I chose to do 4 stars instead of 5 is that the seat beside me was dirty and the men's washroom looked sorta like a women's washroom with only stalls. But I think this place is good in general and you guys should come here when you have the chance!"}
{"text":"Akimi is not bad. Tried this place on a weekend a few weeks ago and it was decent. 

The store is clean and contemporary, and the staff are very friendly. I decided to get takeout for a few items although there was plenty of seating. 

As mentioned in other reviews, the portion sizes are kind of small. I noticed this too once opening my takeout boxes at home. Nonetheless, the taste is ok. 

I got the salmon teriyaki, salmon sashimi, salmon sushi, and a few salmon rolls. My favourite items were the salmon rolls - prepared well and tasted good. The salmon teriyaki, although the flavour is there, the portion size is quite small. Having said that, the prices are very reasonable. 

It's not the absolute best quality sushi, but if you want a sushi fix this does the trick."}
{"text":"This is my favorite all you can eat restaurant that I've ever been too. Food was amazing, I recommend the chicken teriyaki and spicy miso soup. Very clean and great service. Paying the price for all you can eat is totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"If you live in Richmond Hill/ Markham area you know how hard it is to find a good AYCE Sushi place however when you do stumble upon one which is even SLIGHTLY better than the rest, you know you have to share with others. I understand 905 FAM the struggle is real!

First Impressions: Came here for lunch on a Friday and when you walk inside the first thing you will notice are large red booths that could easily sit 6-8 people however only a few seats for smaller parties. The place was clean, CP24 was playing, and overall felt spacious. We had a party of 2 but they gave us a large booth anyways which I appreciated.

Food Impressions: Like most decent AYCE sushi places you are not going to get great quality in food but I must say it was better than a lot of ones that I have been to. They use the iPad system which to me is overly used now. You had your typical stuff that you'd get everywhere else plus a few nice surprises like the GRILLED SANMA. The MAKI ROLLS and SUSHI ROLLS were typical like most AYCE sushi places but it wasn't bad, I enjoyed it. The seaweed on the HAND ROLLS was crispy. The best of their selection were the dessert choices. Not only did you get ice cream (green tea, red bean, vanilla, chocolate) but they also have COCONUT PUDDING, JELLO, FRIED BANANA and my personal favorite SESAME BALLS.

Service Impressions: Right when we got into the door we were greeted with a friendly hello. She walked up to us and brought us to our seats. Why do I mention this? Isn't it typical for restaurants to do this? Uhh not in most Asian restaurants. Service was quick and consistent.  We had no problem with food as most of it came out together. The service here I would say is consistent and I had no issues with it.

Opportunities: I would like to see AYCE places include Akimi who uses iPads as an ordering system use it as an extension of their service and not solely rely on it. 

Overall Impressions: It is what it is. An AYCE sushi place that isn't bad but also isn't OMG material. It is slightly better than most in terms of service, their bigger selection of food, and their taste on certain items. Overall this place to me is better than a lot of places in this area."}
{"text":"Average AYCAE sushi place. There are better restaurants for cheaper, but this is convenient for when you crave sushi."}
{"text":"First time here and all I can say is I won't be coming back. 

This AYCE place appears to be family owned and operated. Came on a Thursday and the service was slow as they only had two servers for the entire restaurant. The food service was also either REALLY slow or missed. Many of the items we ordered never came. Or did not come in the full amount we ordered. We always had to ask the server for things such as wasabi, tempura sauce, tea refills. The only good thing I can think of is the use of iPads for ordering. 

In terms of the food, it was not great- but passable. Quite a variety they offer but I've definitely been to better AYCE restaurants. The food like mentioned came out really slow or just never came at all. They bring out one food item at a time, literally. The sashimi we ordered all came separately and I didn't like that. We placed several orders and some items from our first initial order came out when we were ready for dessert. 

The service was friendly but slow, we always had to ask the server for things. And also since its family operated, there were young kids running around the restaurant, whining and screaming. Not the best ambiance. 

There is definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"Tasteless fish... Even for an all you can eat place. Charge like a premium ayce, but the service is slow (one waiter, one chef, even the iPad ordering doesn't help speed things up), the flat wooden booth benches are back breaking, and every dish tastes and feels the same.

Was hoping to find a decent ayce sushi place close to home, guess I'll keep looking..."}
{"text":"When did they start to add 20% tips on the bill. I always pay tips but let me choose what amount to give dont just add it yourself. A tip should be your choice and not mandatory. If you feel the service is good tip any amount you like dont just add it. Not only that they don't give you the right amount of pieces you order. They short you on your pieces. Lets say if you were to order 20 pieces of sashimi when it arrives its only 12. And its expensive $32.75 after taxes. With their mandatory tip of 20% at the end your bill is $36.02 each person. That's way too much."}
