{"text":"Truely excellent coffee.  Their mokas are top notch, reasonable prices.  I would put their coffee up there with some of the best I the city.  Very nice seating space and the staff have all been super nice.  Will have to try their new sandwiches soon. Cheers"}
{"text":"The cafe is very clean. It's mostly quiet, and not too crowded so it's good for me to get some work done. The baristas are friendly as well."}
{"text":"Petit café amical et bien situé au coin Sherbrooke/Saint-Laurent. Leur latté glacé était super bon et l'endroit très propre et spacieux. La lumière naturelle qui y entre par les nombreuses fenêtres donne un vibe agréable au café."}
{"text":"I love all the natural light that floods into this place. It makes it perfect for studying or an afternoon read. The décor is minimal with a black and white colour scheme accented with wood and greenery. The latte is rich and the staff are really friendly. I believe this café opened not too long ago so I'll probably come here more often before it becomes flooded with regulars!  P.S. They just surprised me with some free samples...sweet!"}
{"text":"Best Served 3rd Wave Around. Watch the care used to make your delicious Java.  At the Crossroads of the Main and the Old 138 (Sherbrooke)."}
{"text":"This cafe has everything going for it. Accessible location, perfect lighting for studying, lots of plugs, delicious Pilot coffee, and best of all, AMAZING staff. Seriously I've been here for 3 hours and gotten a free matcha latte and a sample of sausage pizza. Granted, don't come expecting free stuff everyday, but do expect to be welcomed with friendly smiles :)"}
{"text":"Tasty espresso, lovely setting (big windows on the street scene, nice plants and wood surfaces, quiet with nice background music), and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"I have been to this coffee shop twice and they offer good drinks and the vibes of this bright cafe are simply amazing. Lately they offered a new drink: caramel latte, which was not sooo sweet and tastes quite good! I like the quality of the coffee here, as well as the friendly staff. They always want to get feedback from customers and do better. The interior decor of the café is simplistic but super nice, with quite a few plants and beautiful flowers in spring. The café is trendy and bright, ideal to study, work and chill with friends, definitely recommending!"}
