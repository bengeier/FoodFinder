{"text":"Superb food and very nice ambiance.  The Bavette was one of best in recent memory - cooked to absolute perfection and simply presented.  Scallop, artichoke and chorizo appy was substantial and a perfect balance of tender scallop, rich chorizo crumble and bitter radicchio. Service was attentive and friendly.  As all places, it filled and got noisy - but that's the trend unfortunately. Will certainly return."}

{"text":"PARTIAL REVIEW 
Sourdough Bread with Fromage Blanc and Shallots

[5]

Lordy-lord, this was some of the best bread I've had since I was in Paris- and I never eat from the bread basket before dinner. Crusty and satisfying on the outside, and warm and satiny within, made even more irresistible with the tangy fromage blanc and sharp crisp shallot.

Persimmon, Sprouted Black Lentil, Spinach ($13)

[7]

With sweet, jammy persimmons, earthy sprouts and an abundance of crunchy toasty almonds, this is the epitome of feel good food- food that is inherently both healthy and hedonistically satisfying for all the senses at once. 

Confit Chicken, Celery Root, Rye ($16)

[8]

Talk about comfort food. This tasted like the most flavourful Sunday roast chicken you're grandma never made. Blessedly juicy meat, sweet nutty celeriac, hearty broth and aromatic crunchy rye crumbs on top. Man, you have a bowl of this and a plate of that persimmon salad, and you've undoubtedly outsmarted the cold and flu.

Snow Crab, Golden Beets, Fennel, Saffron

[9]

An off menu dish brought to us by the chef comprised of delicate, sweet, refreshing flavours. From the luxurious snow crab, fruity beets, and aromatic crisp fennel, it was a perfect light late Fall dish to contrast the typical hearty cool-weather fare.  

Seared Bavette, Caramelized Shallots, Black Pepper ($22)

[11]

Perfectly seasoned meat, prepared simply and paired beautifully with a bed of sweet onion jam.

Egg, Mushroom, Savoury Granola ($19)

[10]

This was probably my faourite dish of the night. I absolutely fell in love with the meaty supple mushroom medley, made even more luxurious by the unctuous egg and addictively crunchy granola. I want to put that granola on everything.

Dark Chocolate Ganache, Caramel, Milk Ice Cream ($8)

[13]

I'm not usually a chocolate girl, but this dessert was so perfectly balanced, I nearly licked the plate. The generous portion of luscious bitter-sweet ganache was coated with crispy light cookie crumb, and paired with a sticky sweet caramel, a bright tangy sour cream and buttermilk ice cream and a sprinkling of candied cacao nibs. Holy, yes. After this, I wanted to do the whole meal again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Seasonally chosen specials with minimal decisions to make, let the kitchen decide what's best for you.  Such a comfortable room in a great location.  This is where to take a date if you really want to impress."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here last night as an Anniversary dinner. The portions weren't huge, so don't come here so hungry you want to eat your arm.

We had the pumpkin risotto (amazing), steak that was a bit fatty but really flavourful, and the beet salad and lobster dish as appetizers. We were sufficiently full to be happy and didnt need dessert.

Definitely a hot spot and would recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Our Dandylion experience started off amazingly. 

The server recommended the pig jowl which was not on the menu.  He said it was an \"amuse Bouche\" sized dish so we could still order two appetizers and two mains for the two of us. 

The pig jowl was incredible. It wasn't however, small. It was almost main dish sized. 

Our appetizers were also incredible- chicken confit and white fish. 

This is when things started to go downhill...  The restaurant started to fill up, and our server basically disappeared for the rest of the night other than to serve our main dishes which were average. The trout was very saucy and had a fishy taste to it, and the Bavette, while tender was boring. 

I would still recommend this place.. But I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Halibut was sensational. A total triumph. My husband ordered the short rib and it was equally fantastic. We were on an anniversary \"pub crawl\" in our hood. Embarrassed to say we've never been here and it's been open since last November. We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Another 5 star find. The restaurant is quaint but lively, unpretentious and most importantly amazing food. Small menu that's non-descriptive, but turned out above and beyond expectations. Also, truly appreciate the service of fresh bake bread and cheese spread. Great wine select. Attentive service. Unforgettable dessert, -lime, coconut and basil. It was fresh, tangy and a must try."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. I mentioned this when I made the reservation, along with our allergies. The first thing that impressed me here was that they acknowledged the birthday warmly, but didn't say anything about the allergies until necessary when they explained the menu, and offered to accommodate them by modifying the dishes. The fact that they had thought of it beforehand was very appreciated and made us feel so welcome. The service was perfectly professional throughout the night, but very down to earth and sincere as well - our server looked beautifully understated in professional black clothing, but with low cut white chucks.

The food was fantastic, and we both had trouble picking our favourite. Actually that's not true - if they have the caramel ice cream when you go, do not leave that place without ordering it.

My only teeny tiny complaint is that it wasn't reeeeally romantic. It's a beautiful warm industrial space but I would rather go with a small group - which I will be doing as soon as I get the opportunity to come back."}
{"text":"To be honest we were a little pissed off that this place was charging so much for the food they were serving. Nothing special really... Boiled chicken in a light chicken broth. Pork belly done pretty typically etc

The menu is limited which is usually a great thing. We were a table of 6 and we pretty much ordered everything on the menu. 

The only thing we liked was the carrot soup and the veggie main dish. 

The place has a pretentious vibe to make you okay about paying those prices. Numerous better places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple salads and mains.  Had high expectations because it was ranked high on canada's top restaurants.  Unfortunately it was very normal and the taste was quite bland.  The wine was good though.  Whoever worked on the veg station did a way better job than whoever worked on the mains."}
{"text":"After the good reviews about restaurant, we decided to go. My husband and I dine out every Friday. Was really dissapointed.  The food was bland, small portions for the price and not much to choose from on the menu.  Wish we chose a different restaurant.  Spent 200 for two people and was not impressed and still hungry!  Ordered pizza later.  Wouldnt go back."}
{"text":"Visited Dandylion for dinner with three fellow diners, and all hailed our experience as an extremely enjoyable and memorable dining experience - the food and service were excellent. In addition to superb food and service, Dandylion has an extensive beer selection that boasts some labels you typically don't find in many restaurants in Toronto. It's important to note that Dandylion changes its menu often (hence why it's missing from their website) so a subsequent visit will likely be met with a completely different offering of food. Also -- the kitchen is practically in the restaurant and it is amazing to see the efficient orchestration of its operation. 

Service was stellar; professional, courteous, and attentive. (10/10)

After ordering our drinks, we were served complimentary homemade sourdough bread with a light and delicious cheese spread with shallots - it was absolutely delicious. (10/10)

Between the four of us we ordered 3 types of appetizers:
- Golden Beets: served with pomegranate, and pomelo - fresh and delicious (9/10)
- Scallops: served with leafy greens and capers and a light vinaigrette (8/10)
- Thai Lamb Salad: served with julienned vegetables and nuts (9/10)

For our mains we ordered 2 varieties:
- Braised Pork - fellow diner remarked that it was extremely tender and flavourful
- Trout with Root Vegetables in Butter Sauce - light and powerful flavour combination--absolutely delicious (9/10)

Desert:
- Raspberry and White Chocolate with Semolina paste - simple but incredible (9/10)
- Poached Pear & Ginger Cake - very strong taste of ginger but paired nicely with the other ingredients on the plate (8/10)

Overall a great experience and looking forward to coming back to a similar or different menu. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered everything off the menu and it was all so delicious. I loved the atmosphere, service and wine list. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't usually leave reviews, but this was just too good. The peas with barley was one of the best things I've ever eaten. The lamb was perfectly cooked as well. One of my favourite places in Toronto - would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place.

In offering a wine choice for our meal, the server noted that the wines were quite bright and skinny as their food \"was not very masculine.\" It was an interesting expression but perfectly characterizes the tastes at Dandylion. The food was clean and lean; tart, distinct, light tastes - lovely grilled octopus offset beautifully with fennel. It's creative, and very good. not like the food you're eating everywhere else."}
{"text":"Had a delightful meal here.  Service was excellent.   Ambience was great and surprisingly quiet despite the open kitchen.

People rave about the fresh bread and cheese spread with good reason, we had to force ourselves to stop wolfing it down.

The menu is small and, apparently, changes often; this is not a place for picky eaters as you may not find something to your liking.  We had 4 of the 6 dishes offered and all 4 were excellent.  My pork terrine was delicious and the pickeral was perfect.

The drink options are also limited but very well chosen.

We shared a cheese plate for dessert and the slices were huge,  we were glad we shared."}
{"text":"The positives about this place for me were a beautiful room and friendly service. The menu selection and food left a lot to be desired. There are three appetizers to choose from ($18 each) and three entrees to choose from ($24-$26). Almost like you are on a plane. I found the potions very small and left hungry. The tiny sirloin steak I got was served with some beans and cabbage. It was all really salty. You'd think with only three items they'd know how to make them well. 

I wouldn't return and I think you'd be better off forgetting this hipster place and get a shawarma across the street."}
{"text":"Dandylion was fantastic. We ordered the whole menu and everything was good. I didn't like every dish equally but overall the food was great. 
The portions were generally good and for 3 people we were full when we left, also having ordered 2 desserts. One of the desserts was sour cream, brown sugar with a mixture of different wild berries and was so lovely and refreshing. I believe Edulis does something similar with wild Ontario berries.
The only thing that is a bit questionable in terms of price is ravioli. It's 1 ravioli and I think it was around 25 dollars. That's a little ridiculous.
The tuna ceviche was amazing and the raw beef was incredible as well, the portions being quite generous for an appetizer. For the main, the lamb was my favorite, with the ravioli being the least favorite dish of the night.
The atmosphere is lovely and service was very good as well. It was obvious that the dishes were done with a lot of care. It's definitely on the pricey side, but not more expensive than most fine dining in Toronto. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating at Dandylion, having heard a lot about the restaurant and the experience. I understood that we would be getting a slim menu, no cocktails, and a paired down, almost Scandinavian preparation of food.

After having eaten there last night though, I wasn't overwhelmed. Wasn't really underwhelmed either. Basically, I'm just \"whelmed\".

The positives are that the service was very friendly, with a casual \"you're eating at my house\" feel. We were poured a complimentary snifter of a cider to sip when we expressed an interest in the ciders on the menu, which was a nice touch. The ambiance is also nice, with your fairly typical Toronto narrow restaurant setup, but the tables are unforgivably close to one another (again, Toronto typical)

The \"meh\" portion of the evening really focused around the food itself. The menu clearly changes extremely often (I believe daily?) and you never know what you are going to get. That's usually a bonus for me, as I like trying new things and I'm happy to have the chef mix it up in order to stay local or in season. But from first glance at the offerings, I was a little disappointed. Nevertheless, we both enjoyed the very fresh wholewheat bread and cheese spread (probably the best part of the meal). We both decided on the squid starter (squid, onions, mushrooms) which arrived looking very soupy. The squid was tender and tasty, but the whole dish came off as poorly put together. A bunch of stuff in a bowl, basically. The squid, mushrooms and onions were topped with dill (hello Scandinavia) and drenched in a balsamic and oil dressing. It was good-ish, but for the price and the buzz I expected a lot more.

The main course was problematic because I didn't really feel like any of the three options (no lamb or beef or pork as main choices, only chicken, salmon or veggie). But I settled on the roast chicken, onion, squash. My dining companion asked to increase the size of one of the starters (pork, hazelnut, cabbage), which was accepted.

The chicken came, and I was just...whelmed. Thoroughly whelmed. Half a chicken breast, thin layer of skin. An onion. A puree (apple?). A piece of squash. Quarter inch of soup. All in, everything was just so...wet. My dining companion's main was a small amount of pork tenderloin, a truck load of hazelnuts, and soggy cabbage, in a quarter inch of broth. I couldn't imagine eating all of those hazelnuts but he worked through it. Clearly, there needed to be more fat in the broth or the meat, as it came off a little worthy and pious. But maybe that's the Scandinavian in it. My chicken was very tender, but very small. The squash was excellent. The currents were odd. The onion was an onion. All in, a very strange dish. It definitely left me feeling as if I had just had lunch at a spa or health club, rather than dinner at a restaurant.

We skipped dessert and went straight to coffee. All in, with a bottle of wine, a glass of bubbles, and a cider, the meal came to $215 before tax, so not a cheap endeavour, especially when I was hungry quite soon afterwards. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Dandylion is a unique place. The menu is small and changes regularly.  Options are provided in threes. 3 starters. 3 mains. 3 desserts.  I quite like the 'simplicity' of the menu, it makes ordering a breeze! For the mains, there's usually 1 vegetarian option, 1 fish option, and 1 meat option.  The dishes however are anything but simple. First are foremost, the presentation is incredible. The dishes are almost too beautiful to eat. Definitely Instagram worthy ;) Secondly, the meals are healthy and balanced with portion controlled sizes. Some may feel the portions are small, but after having a starter and a main I was totally satisfied. But that didn't stop me from ordering a dessert!  

I had a warm beet salad as a starter, followed by halibut wrapped in butter soaked cabbage, and shared a panna cotta with a blueberry sauce.  I enjoyed everything and while devouring the dessert the Chef came out and kindly offered us some homemade almond biscotti. Even my Italian friend gave the seal of approval for the panna cotta and the biscotti ;)

Now for the not-so-great news. The service was below par. Even the Chef noticed because at one point he left the kitchen and discreetly asked the server to clear our plates. Also, we ordered a couple bottles of wine and the server would pour our glasses to the rim!  It wasn't very classy and reminded me of my 18 year old self drinking baby duck wine out of a mug at a house party (I've come a long way, lol). After dessert my friend ordered one last glass of wine which never arrived. Seemed like our server anxiously wanted her shift to end. She was young and carefree, maybe she had a house party to attend! ;) 

Despite the poor service, I will definitely return to this restaurant. I'm interested in seeing what other creations the Chef will whip up. 

Other important things to note: It's a small venue.  Not suitable for large groups. In fact, they don't even like taking reservations for groups larger than 4. Likewise, if you're a picky eater go somewhere else. Seeing as the menu is so small, you may not find something that you like. Lastly, there was an older crowd. Almost everyone had grey hair (which I happen to find sexy), but worth noting because it's not the typical young queen west hipster restaurant that you expect."}
{"text":"First thing I have to say is that the service was outstanding. The server was extremely knowledgable and she was truly gifted.
There is a limited selection of wine and some craft beers, no mixed drinks so expect variety. 
While the food was good it wasn't great particularly in light of what they charge. You're looking at almost $100 per person with wine and the portion size was modest at best and the presentation was \"artsy\" We didn't leave fulfilled and the four of us unanimously agreed we would not go back."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed at this place after it was ranked in top 5 of best new restaurants in Toronto Life.

Food was good, but underwhelming.  Braised meat was inconsistently cooked and kind of tough.  Service was mediocre and my biggest pet leave when you spend $15 on a glass of wine and they pour your 4.5 oz if you are lucky - and the owner/manager was watching the bar tender like an eagle making sure she didn't pour too much!  Really annoying when you spend $200 on dinner and they are so stingy on the wines by the glass -"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high.

Can't complain about the well-curated drinks menu and simple but thoughtful dishes made with high quality ingredients. 

There were a couple misses, though; for e.g., $18 for a just okay kale salad with buttermilk poppyseed dressing (billed as absolutely incredible, the best, by our server) cannot be justified.

 I would gladly go back to try more dishes if I was in the area and could get a reso on a whim.

Highlight: Scrumptious freshly baked bread and white cheese dip with shallots for the perfect amount of sweet and pungent bite."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for dinner last night for my birthday and our expectations were quite high after reading so many amazing reviews as well as their recent accolades from Canada's 100. We were fortunate enough to be seated very close to the open kitchen and it is a well oiled machine! We had 2 appetizers and 2 main courses which we shared as well as one dessert. My take away from the meal was that it tasted like spring. Perhaps intentional perhaps not, but there earthy aromas and flavor combinations were on point. Each plate was so well constructed without being precious or pretentious and portion sizes were perfect for sharing. Favorite bite was the terrine appetizer. The dill accents were a thoughtful and unexpected touch. The spinach ravioli was also delicious again the earthy flavors were carried through. My only complaint was that the pasta was not consistently cooked through. A little too al dente. Another stand out was the endive salad that was actually fun to eat with your fingers. The tuna was quite good not my favorite plate but I think that was just preference because everything was well executed. The preserved rhubarb tart was delicious but the pastry tasted like it had been cooked the day before. Very interesting wine list as well, with a few I'd never heard of. Attentive service as well and food pacing perfect! Would highly recommend Dandylion."}
{"text":"Overall a pleasant and different experience.
A long narrow room with the kitchen at the back, a bar on one side and small tables quite close together. There is quite an echo.
The menu is limited to 3 starters, three \"plates\", and three deserts, which are varied quite frequently. 
Hot healthy bread with a cheese, sprinkled with onion dip was brought to the table shortly after we sat down. A good start.
 We had poached shrimp with cucumber and tomato vinaigrette which was absolutely delicious, rather like a mild ceviche. The raw beef, radish, buckwheat resembled a very mild tartar, with the buckwheat providing crunch. A small dish.
For our main course, we had white tuna with peas and butter. This too was excellent, with snow peas, fresh peas and lightly done tuna steaks. The roast lamb, rare, broccoli and potato was good, with the potato in a sort of balsamic type sauce. We finished with raspberry vanilla tart which was small but well made.
There are at least half a dozen beers, ciders, and a somewhat limited wine list.
The meal comes in quite pricey at over $100 per head."}
{"text":"This was a family affair for 2 birthday girls, same date, same month!!!

Dandylion changes menus frequently, depending on the season. We didn't need to spend too much time go over the menu, it was a 3-3-3 selection.  So we ordered the 3-3 (no desserts).

We tried not to over-stuff ourselves with the complimentary bread, so good.  We had soup and salads, one meat, one fish and one vegetarian dish.  The presentation of each dish was exquisite and the taste equally matched the presentation.

The service was prompt, friendly and efficient.  

Why not 5 stars?  Desserts were top heavy on the ice cream side and we were not in the mood for ice cream on this evening.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"We love this place. It's wonderful to try the new flavours, the service is attentive but nor overbearing, and the place is romantic and modern. The beer and wine selection is very good. It is a bit pricey but.....A little gem!"}
{"text":"The \"Lentils, Tomato Jam, Cauliflower\" was a surprising hit.  The lentils were so infused with flavour that it almost tasted like meat (this was a vegetable dish).  The slight drizzling of tomato jam around the lentils and the soft cauliflower made for such a unique dish and subtle pop of flavour.  It was really a surprising vegan dish!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. The service was personal and attentive but not intrusive. The restaurant has a great atmosphere. Casual yet refined. The food was fantastic. The stuffed chicken wing was excellent as were the oysters. And the black cod dish that I had was the best fish that I have ever had in a restaurant. The chef was available to his guests and kept a keen eye on the kitchen staff that were engrossed in their craft. No attitude about this place. Just a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Not my thing. Let me start with what was good- pretty atmosphere, good wine list and non-fussy service. The food was very disappointing. The salad was too lettucy and rather dull, the steak tartare tasted of nothing but buckwheat and the raw tuna  starter was under-seasoned. The mains were also ok- the lamb was a bit chewy but the salmon was very crispy and tasty. The peas that accompanied the mains were fresh and crispy. The place was about 75% female which speaks to the limited popularity of this heavily curated menu. So glad that my husband did not go as the dainty portions (and he is by no means a big eater) and under-seasoning would not have gone over well! Not dreadful by any means but would likely not return."}
{"text":"I was worried this would be a snob-fest since they do reservations only. But it's a very laid-back but elegant place.

I ordered the halibut and grilled romaine since I've never had grilled lettuce before. It was delicious. I also stuffed myself with the bread bowl (see photo) of in-house bread and fresh goat chèvre. They very graciously gave me more to take home.

The server made an excellent recommendation for cider which I can't remember, but it was about 14$ for the bottle. 

I really love the design of the restaurant- they were playing Wild Beasts and have plants hanging off the walls and the lighting was so soft!

It is on the loud side since the tables are close together, but there was a high-pitched group of 5 who were having a reunion so that can be forgiven. 

Definitely recommend as a date."}
{"text":"Dandylion has had such mixed reviews on yelp, but has consistently been on top lists of places to go in Toronto, we just had to check it out.  It's a smaller restaurant with good ambience - plants everywhere, kind of feels like you walked into someone's apartment if it had been converted into a restaurant. The kitchen is open and visible at the back of the restaurant.  The menu is limited, but the food is absolutely fantastic.  We tried a little bit of everything - and everything was absolutely mouthwateringly delicious.  The menu does change regularly - and i can't wait to go back to try something new!"}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in Toronto. Jay's food is thoughtful, creative and balanced so ingredients and dishes speak for themselves. His style is clear and unique. I thought about flavours in new ways after eating here, and that's the number one goal when I pay for good food and dining experiences. The service was warm and attentive, and the space is comfortable and visually interesting. I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Dandylion restaurant on a Saturday to celebrate a special date.

Some things a lot of reviewers already talked about but I feel are worth mentioning are:

-Dandylion is a high quality, high end restaurant, bring your wallet and budget accordingly 
-Dandylion offers a simple, rotating menu, at any point in time they have a selection of 3 appetizers, 3 main course, and 3 desserts.  This keeps things fresh and exciting, but it means that depending on when you go, you might get a different (and exciting) experience 
-Out of the three choices, there is usually one vegetarian option

That covers the basics, so let's go into my experience Dandylion.

We arrived early in the evening and were promptly seated. The service at this restaurant is top notch.  I would say Dandylion staff provided some of the best service I have had so far in 2017.  The waitress who helped us was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu, our water was filled up promptly, the staff was always available and checked on us at the right intervals.  Top notch.

From the menu of the day, I ordered the mussels appetizer, bavette (steak) main and pistachio ice cream dessert.  My girlfriend went with the trout appetizer, halibut main and brownie dessert.  We sampled some food from each other so I was lucky to try everything!

The mussels appetizer was fresh and delicious, and the trout appetizer was like a raw sashimi dish, boldly flavored sweet and sour but slightly too sour for me.  I would have preferred it a little less sour.

The mains were delightful.  The bavette came with sunchoke and kale and it was so good!  A delicious combination that went really well together.  The halibut was served with carrot and brown butter, another delicious combination .  We absolutely cleaned out our plates down to the last crumbs.  

The desserts were absolutely delicious also.  The brownie was served with ice cream and the combination worked very well together.  The pistachio ice cream with cherry and cookie was also a delight to eat.  Overall, all the food we ate was of very high quality and prepared with care.

Although the food was delicious and the service was incredibly good, the portions were average size (maybe on the small side) and that's the main thing keeping Dandylion from being a 5 star destination for me.  A dinner at Dandylion will be one of my most expensive meals per person this year and I would have liked larger portions to leave me satisfyingly full, instead of just feeling mostly full but not quite satisfied.

Overall, Dandylion is a great restaurant for those looking  to spend top dollar on a great meal.  If that is what you are looking for, go check it out.

4.3 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Nice place but food very basic especially in light of what they charge! Extremely limited choice so you would expect something more unique than the bland plates they serve. Waitress was pushing the $8 water bottles and the wine. OverAll very disappointing. Many better and cheaper restaurants in Toronto. East Thirty Six is a good example."}
{"text":"When my friends told me about a new restaurant that had opened in Toronto I was excited to try it. The location was fantastic and the restaurant set up was great. However, the food and the service left something to be desired.

The ambiance was very unsettling, my friends and I came to have a good meal and decided to have less to drink. We felt the server had judged use on our drink choices and we noticed our service slowly declined through out the night. 

The individually the dishes were alright, not the best food I've had in Toronto. There was nothing to tie each dish together nor did the dishes have anything that was a wow factor. For the price point they were asking for, i had high expectations but the food was underwhelming, service was subpar and there was nothing special about this dining experience. 

There are many restaurants to try near by, I would recommend coming here."}
{"text":"2.6/5

Wow..  I been to many high end restaurants such as splendido and Jacobs. So I don't mind paying extra for a good meal but the dinner at dandylion was the most overpriced and confusing dinning experience I had in a really really long time. I mean.. $20+ for oysters appetizer that was served with unimpressive 3 pieces of oysters with no creativity or any complexity of flavours, $20+ for 6 pieces of overcooked white asparagus appetizer and most importantly, extremely over cooked $30 grouper? Come on. I am more forgiving with overcooked food than others but even to me that grouper taste like its been cooked by a teenager boy who just start learning how to cook. I mean.. if the dish was from small diner with $8 tag, i won't complain it but this place is supposed to be fine dine and there were nothing fine dine about these dishes other than the price tags. If the restaurant was really really  busy, maybe I'll give them a benefit of doubt but there were only two tables in the entire restaurant so there was no excuse for overcooked fish. I'm giving them 2.6 instead of 1 because the service was exceptional and terrine appetizer and bouvett main were not bad. Still doesn't justify the price tag but at least they were cooked properly. 
I don't think I'll come back here for food."}
{"text":"Man, was this place ever hard to find. If you're taking the TTC, get off at the Gladstone stop. Walk a bit to the right. Look for the windowed wall / doors. 

Inside, it was very cozy and warm. They only have 14 tables of 2. They have an open kitchen and you can see the chef's working and the waitresses were extremely attentive.

You can tell that there is a lot of attention to detail as they were constantly scanning. The head chef also walked around and you can tell he was looking at how his food was received by how they ate his food. 

There are 3 choices each of a starter, entree and dessert. (vegetarian, seafood and meat)

My partner and I had squid tempura as a starter, seared beef for an entree and she had a brownie with caramel, cream and almonds and I had ice cream with a berry sauce and cracker. 

The bread came presented in a nice cloth and I liked how 'clean' the presentation was. The bread was warm enough to melt the cheese gently, but not so hot that it would burn your hands. 

The squid tempura was battered lightly and the spicy mayo added a nice kick. Only issue I had here was that the tempura would fall off the squid pieces because I cut it. Then again, I think I would've preferred a tempura sauce and...chopsticks. I don't really like using forks for tempura because it's more messy and i'd like to keep the tempura on the squid intact.

For the beef dish and vegetables, it was quite good. I wish I could have more of a red wine sauce as it was enough for the beef, but not enough to rub/soak the vegetables in. I really thought it was a new type of potato, but it turned to be a sunchoke (never heard of it before). It was like a mashed potato in roasted form without the starchy aftertaste of a mashed potato. 

Dessert was very good. I liked my ice cream as it was the softest soft ice cream i've ever had. The berry sauce accompanying it was sweet, but not overly done. The cracker...let's not talk about the cracker. It was a great combination with cracker, ice cream and sauce.


Price: 4/5
Service: 5/5
Food: 4.5/5
Price Point: 4/5

This place is good for an upscale date or quiet-for-two birthday. Any parties larger than 4 would probably have a tough time getting a reservation. Don't bother trying to reserve a party larger than 4 on a weekend unless you plan on reserving the whole place yourself.

Do not go in expecting to be full at the end of the meal. The portion sizes are adequete if you plan on having the standard 3 course. You should expect to drop about ~$60 per person for this meal. It's pricey, but worth the experience."}
{"text":"Came here twice in the last month. Different menus each time. I loved the fish the first time. Environment was nice. Service was good. Overall good but my friend penned it 'best restaurant' in the city and I think based on my experience that's a stretch"}
{"text":"Dandylion is a fun spot for a date or dinner with friends. I had a fun night with a group of friends. Here are a few notes from my experience to help my fellow Yelpers:

1. There are three appetizer options, three main options, and three dessert options. They also serve wine and beer, but no cocktails.
2. Prices are above average. Expect to pay close to 100$ per person if you do all three with a glass of wine.
3. I had a yogurt, grapefruit and beet appetizer that featured different types of grapefruit and beets. It was extremely delicious. For the main, I had the strip loin (28$), which was served with a sweet corn and vegetable base. It was less creative, but no less delicious. For dessert I had the dark chocolate cake and avocado ice cream, which definitely hit the \"sweet spot\" between creativity and comfort.
4. The space is casual, complete with exposed brick and open kitchen. It is charming.
5. Service is very good. While they may still be working out some kinks, my service experience was as good as any other similar place in town.

Dandylion is on its way. I look forward to eating here again."}

The service is outstanding and personal.

{"text":"Heard so much about this place but was a bit disappointed. The food was mediocre ...."}
{"text":"I've never felt less special at a restaurant.

Sure, when they made a point to mention that they'd be charging us for the extra bread I felt weird. 

If four of you are spending $300+ on a meal shouldn't you be able to get an extra loaf on the house?

It just got stranger from there.

We arranged to split the bill with our friends.   We covered more of the total, and they covered the tip... with a much much more generous amount than was customary.     Nonetheless,  when the server saw that we did not add a tip to our part of the bill, he returned to loudly ask us about gratuity.    Made everyone at the table feel really awkward.     

All of this silliness and stinginess would have been totally fine had the food been memorable.   

It truly wasn't.  Which is a shame, because the location is great and the beer selection is stellar.     

Instead though, you get a mediocre meal in a staid environment.    Nothing shocking.   Nothing special. 

If you are dead-set on eating at every restaurant creatively named after a flower in the city,  you should run here as fast as you can.   Because in a highly competitive foodie market like Toronto,  I can't imagine this place lasting a year."}
{"text":"Sorry but no. Cute storefront and interior environment. However, we walked in for a table for two (it wasn't busy at all) and the hostess literally asked us if we want to see a menu before we were seated. This was AFTER we asked for a table for two. I have never been more mortified in my life and I could not believe how condescending this was. We we're not dressed in joggers or anything like that and we literally have eaten at restaurants WAY finer than this one. So if you don't want to experience pretentious judging, don't go here. Still can't get over how douchey that was."}
{"text":"Perfect date night.
Cozy atmosphere with a small open kitchen serving what ever the chief can find in the market that same morning.

It has a small menu with only 3 options for main courses and they are reasonably priced. I had the short ribs an they were absolutely delicious.

The only thing making this resteraunt have 4 stars instead of five is the portion size. I do wish there was more food on the plate but I did leave feeling satisfied and enlightened by a cool culinary experience."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place. Great good quality. Menu changes all the time. Great drink selection. Friendly service. Nice decor. Clean place. Music just a tad loud, and front entrance hard to spot."}
{"text":"Went to Dandylion about a week ago with a visiting friend. We had a great experience. Warmly greeted on arrival we were promptly sat. We were near the open kitchen where we could see the Chef and his team working. He also welcomed us which was nice. Apparently some people don't like being sat there, but we loved it. It felt like a small chef's table. Overall, service was top notch.

Now for the food - that bread! Oven-fresh with shallot and black pepper cheese spread. So good. Salivating now. Want more.

It's a limited menu which we appreciated. You can't beat a well composed and thoughtful, seasonal menu. Starting with a glass of sparkling white, we had pork jowls and duck confit for starters, both delicious. Moving on, we had the steak and salmon for mains - perfect portion sizes. The salmon was a touch salty for us, but perfectly cooked. As an aside, I don't get how other reviewers are complaining about portion sizes. You don't need massive amounts of protein. 

I usually opt for spirits as my dessert of choice, but the caramel ice cream was supremely good. We also got the cheese plate because we were in pure glutton mode. It was good but we were way too full to properly enjoy it. 

Basically just order everything and enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent! Wonderful service, Basque cider, amazing food.
The aged beef appetizer was quite large - great greens and artichoke chips too - slightest fault for the turnips being a little underdone but still incredible
The cod with fancy mushrooms and eggplant puree was just perfect.
I tried the mussel appetizer with sea asparagus and cabbage - possibly the best mussels ever.  Shucked too, which is nice. 
Portion sizes varies a bit - beef app was big but mussels were smaller.  Not cheap but good value,  and you need at least 2 things - main and app or main and dessert. I maybe shouldn't have eaten so much bread with fresh cheese,  but it was so good. ..
Will be back. Must have an open mind and be willing to try new things with such a small menu, but one of the best meals I've had in Toronto. 
And also - Basque cider."}
{"text":"I don't think Yelp has the rating wrong for this resto that some have recently touted as one of the best spots in the country. It's has a cool vibe but is not for us cutting edge nor top of any traditional class."}
{"text":"Delicious wholesome food.

I appreciated the slim menu, like a tasting menu with options.

Food was very fresh tasting,  well cooked, and appealing to the eye.

Nice simple understated decor,  and attentive and professional service. 

Looking forward to dining here again."}
{"text":"The food is hardly visible on the tiny plate but the prices are larger than life.  For some reason the wait staff seemed uncomfortable and grumpy.  We were asked if we would \"like bread?\" Hint; Bread and water are always welcome!  The decor is lacking = Ikea accents w/rough wood details - looks unfinished.  Ho-hum mid-century knockoff chairs.  Are vegetables really the star here, as some suggest?   If so,  serving them up tasty takes finesse and creativity which is missing.   Dandylion has a bit of maturing to do to establish itself as one thing or another.   With 3 apps, 3 main dishes, 3 deserts being the only choices, they all should be A+,  but disappointment awaits.  Bring your wallet but not your appetite.  Pleasant at best due largely to the smart idea of keeping the atmosphere void of loud music, thus conversationally quiet."}
{"text":"Pretentious and overpriced. There is no full bar, no draft beer, and when you ask for a full bodied wine you are told there is none because \"it doesn't pair well with our food\". We tried a pinot noir that tasted like uncle louies back yard batch that was pinkish in colour and cloudy. Lucky we weren't charged for it after we said we didn't like it. Food was so-so and for a 200 bill for two entres and two glasses of wine, so-so is just not good enough. Its too bad because atmosphere was nice and so was the service."}
{"text":"Dandelion is one of the top restaurants in the Canada as of 2018 it is #12 in the Canada's 100 Best Restaurant list.

Finding the restaurant at night might be a challenge for some as there is no light or signs outside the restaurant. My dinner mate have a hard time finding it. I have to go outside to get him in....

I love how limited and seasonal the menu is. I rather have less items to choose from but as long as they are good! They also have a Special of the Day as an alternative choice.

The plating might not be IG worthy as the protein was hidden underneath a bunch of vegetables. But I do respect the Chef's  \"vegetable-forward\" ideology, especially in this now meat porn food scene.

Since the menu is seasonal so what I had exactly is kind of not relevant, but I have to say I enjoyed everything that evening. And of course that soft and fresh from the oven bread.

Service is friendly and professional. 

BTW, my dinner mate is a super picky eater and he enjoyed all the food, which is kind of a miracle.

Thanks so much for Dandylion Restaurant for a yummy and memorable meal!"}
{"text":"Sitting across from my date at the marble-topped table was romantic and intimate, and everything I'd hoped for after waiting an eternity to dine there. It was an otherworldly experience as we conversed over glasses of biodynamic wine and craft cider. I felt like we were encased under a terrarium with plants snaking up the exposed brick walls, the scent of melted butter wafting from the open kitchen behind us. When the lovely server interrupted our fairytale moment to bring a panier of freshly baked whole wheat bread with ricotta, shallot and cracked pepper, the experience kept getting better. Was this too good to be true?"}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to try Dandylion for awhile, so when it came up as an option for a small staff holiday party I put my vote in and won! It was an excellent end to the 2016 working year for myself and my coworkers. 

The menu here is small and always changing, and I think this works in their favour. Plus, its well crafted so you can always satisfy that craving or work within that dietary restriction. Specifically: there is always one vegetarian, one fish, and one meat option for each of the three courses, plus they are happy to make further accommodations (e.g. vegan, gluten free) if you explain when you call to make your reservation. 

We spit a bottle of bubbles and made our orders. I had a super green broccoli soup for my app, the squash and kale for my main, and the selection of cheese with quince for my dessert course. All were delicious left me so full I ended up doing something I rarely do, especially at upscale restaurants: took leftovers home. I always feel a little tacky doing this at nice places, but the staff at Dandylion were not only unfussed, but actually encouraging. It only added to the cozy, unpretentious vibe the space and staff had been giving off all night."}
{"text":"This was a very enjoyable dinner.  The atmosphere is relaxed and informal, and the food very unique. There are only 9 items on the menu, 3 appetizers, 3 mains, and 3 deserts.  The main and appetizers are split, 1 fish, 1 meat, and 1 vegetarian option.  The appetizers (fish, and meat) were very nice and quite unique. But the Bavette (steak) stole the show. It was excellent, some of the best I've had!  I also had a French Pear Cider which was delicious. The desert raspberry ice cream and sauce was also amazing. Very happy I went."}
{"text":"Last night I popped in here for a holiday cheers, dinner and laughs with two colleagues. It took us a while to agree on a place, but when we realized none of us has been to Dandylion, our mission was clear. 

As others have noted, it's a very small, ever-changing set menu. They serve up one fish, one meat and one veg option for the two first courses only. This sounds tiny, but I had a tough time choosing. The beautiful combinations seemed endless. I had a warming, health-giving broccoli soup, the short rib and their cheese plate. If you're ever here and these items are on the menu, jump at them. Everything I ate was so delicious. 

If you're looking for a hygge dinner experience this winter, look no further than Dandylion."}
{"text":"Looking at the other reviews, I'm amazed at how many we're not impressed.  I must say that I am going to come down on the \"impressed\" side of the scale, but I like to experiment with flavours and textures and do eat a dish with my eyes before my mouth.  Yes the portions are small and yes it isn't cheap, but those are not reasons to downgrade the quality of this establishment.

The four of us enjoyed everything we ate.  My only criticism is that I found the soup to be a little overpowered by the dill.  The cheese plate was one of the better ones I've had in Canada.  

Very busy.  Excellent service with a style that one usually sees only in much fancier establishments."}
{"text":"Stunning, beautiful, and tasty dinner experience. 

Ok, so it is a bit over priced for the portions, but my experience here was very memorable.

Six of us sat right in the front, which was nice for air circulation on a breezy spring night. We had 3 different wines (yup), and all were really great. I recommend the un-oaked Chardonnay and Cab Franc. 

The menu is very, very small. We ordered one of everything, and they had great vegan alternatives for the veggie options. In fact, their asparagus dish (without hollandaise) was the best asparagus dish I've ever had. So beautiful, too. I'd also definitely recommend their fava bean main dish. They also brought out a vegan chocolate ice cream, which was absolutely delicious!

Beautiful touches throughout the space and very focused on taking everyday foods to the next level. 

Only for the adventurous! You will be well rewarded."}
