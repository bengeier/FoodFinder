{"text":"Hands down the best churrascaria in the valley. Servers were very attentive, they kept my water glass and bread basket full. They also had chicken hearts and I had my fill of them. All types of meat were seasoned well and nothing was over salty. We are glad to have found this place. We look forward to going there again."}
{"text":"Pretty impressive for opening night. High quality food and excellent service. Will be five star once all the kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"Concur that the Market Place Salad bar is adequate but has no wow factor.  Fogo has had shrimp  and smoked salmon and a better presentation.  The meats are good and the waitstaff is very friendly and will have certain cuts brought out if you request.  Enjoyed the rib eye and bacon wrapped filet and chicken.  Wine markup seems to be about 3x retail.  The strawberry cream was excellent - fresh and light after a relatively heavy meal.  Most of the Elephant Bar decor has been changed, but some areas were not redone.  Mashed potatoes and fried bananas are brought out as the meal begins, may benefit from serving in dishes that helps it retain the heat a little better rather than the open plate/bowl."}
{"text":"As a fan of Brazilian steakhouses, this one did not disappoint. I like it better than Fogo. If you want a great meal without driving to Scottsdale, definitely try this place. They could season the meats a little more. Must try!"}
{"text":"This place is a pale imitation of Fogo.  The drive to Scottsdale is worth the difference in the quality of the food, service, and ambiance.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"We went to Serra Gaucha for a birthday With a large group. The food was good and the staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Below zero. Food ok. Service ok. How they treat staff, horrible. Expectation with only minimal staff, horrible. Don't go. Not worth the $100 plus for 2."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the salad bar. For the money the  salad bar was not worth it. The meat was good. We tried this place because it was close, but we will not be back. Rodizio's is much better all around."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing! Food is delicious. Our server Renee was incredible. Everyone was very engaging, funny and just all around great people.   THE FOOD....currently in a food coma. first you start with the salad bar which has a variety of salads, veggies and even a meat and cheese board. Everything had so much flavor and was very fresh. Then you give the green light to start coming over with the meats! Everything was perfectly cooked had great flavor.. Then we needed it with their molten lava cake. Delicious.  Being a steakhouse, it is expensive but worth every penny. You get the whole package. Great service, delicious food, and just a fun night!"}
{"text":"Overall, it was very good.  I've been to better places with more selections, especially on the salad bar area.  A few of the cuts of meat weren't very good, but others were phenomenal, so.......  Service was very friendly and we never had to wait for anything.  I'd like to see a better selection on the salad bar, otherwise, everything was very good."}
{"text":"Booked a table to take some friends out to dinner... thought we'd try Brazilian BBQ on the west side instead of trekking to Scottsdale... unfortunately while the service was pleasant the food was not up to par. The salad bar was more like a grocery store with just about everything looking like it just came from prepackaged deli section. Cured meats were just a salami and cut up corned beef... salads and vegetables were sparse in choice and similar quality. The meats were average at best and I had to ask repeatedly for the filet to come to our table, took 45 minutes before someone finally showed up with it... it was nice enough but by that point the experience as a whole was lost. Again the service staff was very nice, however for the cost, I'd much rather drive to Scottsdale for a far better overall culinary experience expected from a Brazilian BBQ. Oh well..."}
{"text":"Thank you Jesus!  finally a family oriented place to eat great Brazilian food without having to drive all the way to Scottsdale.  We love this place and staff come to empty stomach since you will need the room the fill-in this delicious all you can eat steak house!  Also don't be shy about take out special occasion appetizers I done it several times and all the guests are amazed!  keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Hello,     We just got home from a wonderful meal at your establishment.   I have no complaints at all.   Everyone was very hospitable and friendly.   The salad bar was what I expected and then some.   Those black beans are to die for.   We had a 12:30 pm reservation. We left at 1:30ish. We were charged the dinner price.   I didn't want to make a fuss at the restaurant because I was treating my husband to a birthday meal.   So I waited till I got home to double check the website as far as prices are concerned.  And I do believe I was overcharged.  Thank you for you time.  Diana"}
{"text":"Great foodb appropriately priced. Service was top notch, from the moment we entered untilwe left the premises. Birthday dessert was free for my friend."}
{"text":"This is my favorite stakehouse in town, the service is great, meat is fresh and very well prepared, the salad bar is really good, so your vegetarian friend can enjoy a great food with you."}
{"text":"Tristan was awesome. This is the first time My wife and I have been here. He explained everything very well. I recommend trying this place and be sure to meet Tristan."}
{"text":"First off their service is amazing! I've been to this location 5-6 times and every single time have been surprised by the amazing servers and staff. I'd prefer coming here than taking the drive out to Scottsdale to go to Fogo. My boyfriend and I usually come here for dinner during the week so it's pretty slow but we came in last night for Valentine's Day and it was packed! The service was better than ever. The meats are all amazing and my personal favorite is the house special picaña. I just wish the salad bar had labels like how they do at Fogo de Chao."}
{"text":"We have not been here before, but it was fantastic.   We had reservations at 5:30, because we didn't want it to be really busy since we had 2 kids with us. Service was great.   The salad bar was pretty good. They had black beans that I think were cooked with bacon. They were good. There was rice but I didn't want any. They had a big heated container of this red stuff that I didn't know what was in it. It seemed like a pasta sauce but I didn't care to ask what it was.   They had a pickled cucumber, onion & tomato salad. I loved it so much. It was fresh and perfect. I wish I ate more of that.  They had small mozzarella balls, standard mixed greens, grilled zucchini (so good), asparagus, a chicken salad (didn't try), apple salad (meh) 2 types of cold meats (didn't try) mushrooms (good but really salty)   The sides:  mashed potatoes, amazing. They were creamy & topped with green onions, exactly how I like them.   Fried bananas, pretty good, my oldest didn't like them, my baby loved them  Cheese bread-one of my favorite Brazilian foods ever. The texture is different than standard dinner rolls. There's Parmesan cheese & due to the use of cassava flour, it has a chewy texture on the inside, with the crispy outside.   We ate so many meats I couldn't tell everything that we ate.   Some of the meats were a little salty, but the flavor was good.   The bacon wrapped filet mignon was my favorite. It was cooked about medium rare. I would eat a ton of if I hadn't eaten so much of everything else.   I wasn't a huge fan of the Parmesan pork. The flavor was okay but it was pretty dry  The desserts we ordered: Brazilian flan-sense, rich, creamy and sweet. It may be denser than what people might be used to, but it was really good and I would get it again.   Papaya mousse-it lacked flavor, I couldn't taste a lot of papaya. It was a light orange color. I wasn't sure if they had been out & trying to make it on the fly, but it tasted like a tiny bit of papaya purée mixed with vanilla ice cream & some additional whipped heavy cream. It was very disappointing, but it was literally the only thing I didn't like.  Chocolate molten cake-it was vanilla ice cream and a basic molten chocolate cake. The kiddos loved it. It didn't taste bad but I was unimpressed.   Atmosphere: relaxed, and \"not judgmental\" for the excessive amount of food we ate.   Will I be back? Probably. I should diet for a week before next time though."}
{"text":"I came for lunch and it was great! Not too busy and service was speedy. The meats were all flavorful and were sliced to order. Sometimes when getting a slice from the center of the cut, the meat seemed to lack a bit of seasoning, but besides that very good. The salad bar was lack luster but most people will be coming here for the meats and not the salad anyway!"}
{"text":"Let's be fair, and not compare this restaurant to Fogo de Chao, because if it was, it would be called that.   With that being said, I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. The restaurant is very large and can seat a lot people, and was about 60 to 70% full while we were there. They played familiar Brazilian music through out the night, which gave the restaurant a really great vibe. Guests were mostly in large parties, and seemed to be having a festive time, lots of loud crowds and laughing.   As far as the food goes, the salad bar had cheese, prosciutto, salami,chicken salad, leaf salad, cucumber salad, huge asparagus, tomato salad, potato salad, hearts of palm, rice, black beans and most likely more if I could remember. It was always fully stocked and super fresh looking.   The meats were good, some a little tastier than others. The chicken, lamb and pork were very tender. I was always able to get medium rare beef at all slicings. The servers were constantly coming to the table when our cards were green.  Complimentary cheese bread (out of this world), fried sweet bananas (delish) and mashed potatoes were served plentifully.   The staff was extremely attentive and professional.   Yes, it's true, the bill was a bit shocking at the end, but for a special occasion, or to take guests from out of town, the price is certainly acceptable.   We will definitely come back, most likely with a group of friends as we did tonight."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE ROCKS!!!   My wife and I anxiously awaited the opening and then made the time to get in here and try it out....we were not disappointed!!  We were very welcomed upon entering and all the staff had huge smiles on their faces.  We have been familiarized with this type of steakhouse and were ready to loosen our belts!  We personally found the salad bar to be very nice but I did not go back for seconds because I left room for all the meat selections!  My wife who is more a salad than meat person was very satisfied with the selections that were provided. We already have plans on going back with our friends and neighbors. The ONLY thing I wasnt happy with is we purchased a bottle of wine expecting to take it home to finish after our glass with dinner but was told at the END of our meal that this establishment does NOT let you take an open bottle home.  Even when I spoke with the owner he did not budge but was so pleasant about it, I wasnt even mad...we sat there till the bottle was gone.  Just be forewarned that if you order a bottle....be prepared to finish it!!!"}
{"text":"What an experience!  We had never eaten at a Brazilian steakhouse. It was so so good. The meat was delicious. I'm not a big meat eater so the next time I go I will hit the beautiful salad bar full of delicious veggies, cheeses, cured meats and rice and beans. The reason I gave this 4 stars and not five was because of the snippy young lady who greeted us smacking her gum!  Lose the attitude sweetie. You are the first impression of a very nice establishment!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and it was a let down. For $50/person I expect better food and more options. The first course is a salad bar with limited choices. I would've liked to have had some warm veggie options. For the second course, you have the meats. Some had little flavor and some overly seasoned. The majority of them were lukewarm in temperature which felt like they'd been sitting on a buffet table. My husband ended up getting sick so I definitely wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. Everything except for the bacon wrapped stuff. I typically like chicken but why eat chicken when they had like 14 different cuts of steak! Yes. This place is pricey and I would avoid the salad bar... but the potatoes and the cooked banana were delicious. The dessert was decent. Nothing exciting. I had cheesecake. I would pass on dessert next time and just eat more steak!"}
{"text":"We went there last night for the first time. I was very impressed to see the owner's Rolls Royce parked in the very front. Do the other employees park in front to? No menus, you go make your own salad. When through, you flip a card over from red to green, and let the fun begin. The carvers bring the meat to you. Top quality, prime cut, tender and juicy. Not just different cuts of beef, but also different cuts of lamb, chicken, & pork, and while very delicious, my wife and I left in a MEAT COMA. Very pricey too. My Wife and I drank iced Tea and Diet Coke, and our bill came to $109 before tip."}
{"text":"This place is solid.  We came here for lunch on a Saturday with our two young kiddos.  They did splendidly and enjoyed their meal  as did hubs and I.  Nice selection of meats and the salad bar was good.  I always have to have gaurana with my brazilian meals and they had it.  Yay!"}
{"text":"Everyone was so attentive food was so good I loved lamb and the Brazilian flan was perfect"}
{"text":"Very kind welcome and attentive wait staff.  The food was good. Only complaint was we had two children under 5 yrs of age, the waitress knew they were 2 & 4  yes old but still charged us half price for both of them...when we pointed out 'error' because children under 7 yrs old  are free, the waitress responded 'oh I saw that on there' but didn't think to correct the bill before bringing it to us.   It was an ok experience overall just wonder if we hadn't pointed out the error if she would have been honest enough to correct the charge"}
{"text":"It's been approximately 6 months since I've been here and WOW! There's been a fabulous flavor explosion. The rodizio offerings have double, but the flavor has quadrupled. Of course, some cuts always require added salt for me, that's just me. The lamb chops and the chicken hearts reign in flavor. Not a fan? Try them. The house choices are delicious. Try them. I didn't eat the chicken, pork, sausage or ham; I came for meat. If your not a meat eater, there's a lot of options for you. I'll be back. Hopefully, grilled pineapple will be added to this friendly and efficient staff/servers. Ciao for now."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Serra Gaucha in Peoria for Mother's Day. I honestly didn't think they would be busy, but they were packed. We never been to a Brazilian steakhouse. Man this is unreal there are SO many different meats. I struggle to eat all of them, because you have a salad bar so you don't know where to begin. We love this place. Don't know much about Brazilian culture, but the restaurants are fantastic.  One I thing I recommend is going in hungry, the whole unlimited meats is overwhelming, in a good way! They have this drink , I forgot what's it called but it's like a margarita but better and they are strong, we were told it's Brazilian rum that gives it th  Our meat server Tristin was really nice. You guys gotta try the Papaya cream , definitely a treat for the taste buds. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Damlicous!!! Service was excellent food was great! Staff was very friendly, nice setting. Definitely telling others about it and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary, it was the best and dessert was on point. Would recommend this place to anyone, especially lunch time."}
{"text":"Great place on the Northwest side of the valley.  Wife took me there tonight for my BD celebration and it was great. 13 different meats cut at the table, very good salad bar to start. I could not get over how good the staff was. There must have been 6-8 cutters with different meats cutting at table to table. Will definitely be going back there.  Great job to the people that make it a great experience"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time today and was very excited to try it. Walking in, the decors were so so, not much to it really. The hostess greeted us right away and was very friendly. We were seated right away and our waitress greeted us with a smile. She explained the specialty drinks,  the salad bar, and main entrees. The salad bar had a nice variety of veggies,  cheese, and a couple salads. The meats were perfectly seasoned and delicious! The best part of the experience was the staff. They were great and made the experience that  much better. So glad that this place opened in the west valley. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Finally ate at Serra Gaucha! Much better than expected and far better than its Scottsdale competitor, for less expense. Its a westside treasure.  Trying to understand the poor reviews of the salad bar. We found it fresh, appealing presentation, wide variety and high quality. The fresh fruit being whole might dissuade one from the fruit. The chicken Alfredo and chicken salad were awesome.  The meats, chicken, beef, lamb, ham, pork, sausage and more. 15 Varieties available. Unfortunately, we both pooped out long before approaching that magic number. Their beef choices and chicken legs were wonderful. Can't really go wrong there. The cheese rolls were light and cheesy. The garlic mashed potatoes were a good but, light on garlic. That coming from someone that believes there is no such thing as too much garlic. The fried bananas got split reviews, I thought they were very good. My wife disagreed, but ate the majority. Go figure.  We'd been told to save room for dessert. We did but could have left more room. We split Brazilian Flan and it was wonderful. Lots of syrup, whipped cream and a cherry (mine).  A very pleasant meal at a not cheap but, well worth the money price. If you want great, fall over you service, comfortable breathable atmosphere and very good food, I recommend you give Serra Gaucha Brazilian Steakhouse a try."}
{"text":"Brazilian steakhouse buffet.  This place took over the wretched elephant bar.  While it is definitely an upgrade of the predecessor tenant it is not going to earn repeat business from me.   The inside is a bit understated.  Very plain decor and table settings. The salad bar was pretty weak. Canned beans, jarred beets, you know where this is going...   80% of the meats were over cooked, dry, and severely lacking any flavor or seasoning. I had to salt,and cover almost everything in the horseradish, salsa, and chimichurri sauce provided. The pork was so overcooked and dry it was inedible.  There were actually several meats we tried and pushed to the side they were so bland and overcooked.    The exceptions were the beef rib slices, lamb legs, and top sirloin.  Those three were cooked and seasoned well.   The caipirinha was excellent but short and jam packed with ice and not worth a second round.  The desserts were just okay. The strawberry cream tasted like Bryers strawberry ice cream.  The cheesecake tasted pasty and couldn't even hold water to the cheesecake factory next door.  Expected much better from a higher end Brazilian steak house buffet.  The service was excellent. All of the meat men were polite and helpful. Our main waiter was amazing. Great personality and very attentive. In fact if it wasn't for the service this review would easily be a two.   Our bill came out to 150+ for two dinners, two drinks, and a dessert. Simply not worth the product in my book. If I am choosing between this all you can eat mediocre food and a perfectly cooked prime beef steak up the road at Arrowhead Grill there is no question where I am going.    The computer printed NOW OPEN sign on the window was a cute touch.   We personally won't be back.  Update: Lowering to one star after Hicham A sent me a compliment stating I don't know what I am talking about and asking me not to return. You won't have to worry about that pal.  I vote with my money and my reviews.  One of those you won't ever see again.  Best of luck!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! From great food to great service don't have anything negative to say. The cool thing is you get all the cuts of meat you want and an awesome salad bar. The desserts were good too tried the flan and the strawberry cream both delicious. Defiantly a great place for a Sunday dinner spot,  we will be back for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"A whole lot of money for not a lot of food if you're a normal person with a normal appetite. Saw some weightlifter types who obviously wanted to pack away the protein. It wasn't that the food wasn't good, just at that price you'd be better off getting a steak elsewhere. This place should offer more flexible pricing. Won't repeat."}
{"text":"Holy crap was this place good! A group of us stopped here for lunch, and everyone left very full and happy. The service was fantastic, and you could tell that the wait staff all wanted us to have a great time.  If you're not familiar with the concept, it's essentially all-you-can-eat meats and salad.  I'm a happy carnivore, so I skipped the salad bar (but it seemed decent sized).  My personal favorites were the picanha, parmesan pork, and bacon wrapped filet... but I haven't found anything there that wasn't in the \"damn good\" category."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened 5 days ago and my husband and I were both pleased and impressed. Service is very attentive... a steady stream of fresh plates and side dishes. And the meats are amazing!!!! Fresh, sizzling and juicy with excellent flavor!!  The salad bar isn't quite as good as some other Brazilian steakhouses I've been to, but honestly you come to a Brazilian steakhouse for the meat not the salad.  All in all an excellent experience! Will be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Fast service constant food very clean very tasty. While it's $45 per person for an adult to eat it's definitely well worth it"}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Great food and service. Nice salad bar with a big variety for you to choose"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food. It was a wonderful place to celebrate our son's birthday."}
{"text":"New place for the west side , first Brazilian steakhouse at this side of town , better than driving to the closest one I. Scottsdale , they charge $45/person for dinner , not sure what their lunch rates are ... service is good , more of a casual place .... meats are not bad and not to dry .... pricey that's why 2 stars out , will come back again only for special occasions :)"}
{"text":"Brought my son here for his birthday, amazing food and service. Great dining experience and our waiter Tristan was awesome. Will definitely be back soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and tasty meat! The meat guys come to your table nonstop, don't have to wait at all, a big plus if you compare to other Brazilian restaurants. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went for the first time this evening and it was great! Service was amazing! The only ding I would give is there were some cuts of meat that were a little tougher than the others and the limited salad bar options even just to dress your salad. Aside from that it was still worth the money and the quality of food was great! We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Good location. Front entrance glass doors were very dirty. Went on a Saturday night at 6pm. The ambience was that of a all you can eat buffet and this sentiment was shared by the entire table. The bar was totally empty the entire time we were there which was roughly 2.5 hrs. Polite servers and meat was readily available by the various carvers. Delicious cuts. However, we waited on drink refills all night and silverware on occasion."}
{"text":"Good stuff, You will leave here with the meat sweats! we showed up right when it opened, The place was empty and the service was fantastic. I'm sure all the servers were bored, we were the only ones in the joint and the meat just kept coming and coming. I felt like a freaking king, Ha. A little bit of advice, don't visit the salad bar, it's a trap. You will fill up on nonsense rabbit food and cheese. Hold out for the house special. The prime top sirloin, I'm pretty sure it's the best cut of meat."}
{"text":"This is a new Brazilian steakhouse on the west side, so I was super excited to give them a shout and find out when they open to take my family there who are in from out of town. We have eaten at the Brazilian churrasco in Scottsdale and absolutely loved it; when I asked the lady how much the price of dinner was, I was floored when she said it was $45 per person. About had a heart attack. In my opinion, this isn't Golden Corral where I'm just trying to eat as much as I can and therefore the restaurant has to mitigate as much loss as possible by charging a larger amount for my meal; this is a place where you can say yes and no to multiple offerings of open fire cooked meats. If I wanted to pay 50 bucks a person, I would have just gone down the road to Flemming's, where I've never been dissappointed and the price matches the excellence of service and foods I'm able to enjoy.  So sorry, but their prohibitive price is going to keep me away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food. A meat lovers dream. Salad bar is good with potato salad, caesar salad, veggies, black beans and rice. The meat is tender and as long as you keep the card turned over to green the meat just keeps on coming. The only meat I wasn't crazy about was the lamb. I found it a bit gamey but everything else was tender and very flavorful. The drinks aren't over priced and quite good."}
{"text":"Awesome alternative to Fogo! Great price and the quality of meats were superb. The staff was very attentive and my tea was never empty! The salad bar was a good compliment to the meats and the complimentary cheese bread,sweet bananas and mashed potatoes were good. I will definitely return and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service was unbelievable,servers all over you. The food was very good. The cost was not justified.Could see the whole experience worth $50,however charging $5 for ice tea and $8 for desert is wrong. We thought going in everything was included. Be a very long time before we go back"}
{"text":"First time coming here. I was at fogo de chao before it's the same concept, the meat is good at both places but fogo has more side options to choice from then here. Also the cheese bread taste better at fogo de chao. At Serra gaucha the bread was a bit hard & cold.  It's a good place if you don't wanna drive all the way to Scottsdale.   So if you never been here before the 1st course you get to pick out your salad, cheese, salami, veggies, rice, potatoe salad, & etc. Buffet style.    When your ready for your 2nd course. There's a card that is red on one side and green on the other. When ever your ready for meat to be served & mash potatoes & bread then you turn it to the green side. When you don't want anymore you turn it to the red side.   The meat comes by servers that go around each table like someone will have chicken drumsticks, another server will come and slice some ham for you & etc.   So far I had the top & bottom sirloin, lamb, parmesan garlic pork, chicken wrapped in bacon, sausage, chicken drumsticks, & ham. They were all really good."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The food was wonderful. The service was great. Staff was friendly and it was amazing how attentive they were. I will eat here every time I come to town and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant exceeded both mine and my husbands expectations! Being huge fans of the Scottsdale competition, we were thrilled to try a place much closer to home and I must say - this place beats Fogo on price, quality, and service. The salad bar was great, the meats were delicious and the staff was on their game. We ordered desserts as well and they were phenomenal. Date night couldn't have been better! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I love Brazilian steak houses!! You get ALL the meat you can fit in you lol as a meat eater I love it. Had a reservation at 8pm but showed up a bit early and got seated immediately, place was clean, fully staffed, and you could see where the meat is being prepared and cooked, awesome  servers where very attentive and making sure we always had Meat in our plates, the only weak point is the salad bar, the selection is small compare to other places I've been to but then again you're there for the MEAT!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Food and experience was really good. A little pricey but all Brazilian statehouses are."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING! Worried about half full parking lot on a Friday. Walked in, table was ready immediately. THEN: A culinary parade of impeccable beef, lamb, chicken, pork, scallops, what appear to be house made kilbasa... Better get an Uber when you come, once word gets out how great this place is there will be nowhere to park tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"When we arrived, the host  greeted us and  grabbed a couple menus but didn't leave menus with us when he sat us.  My husband went and grabbed menus but they were only drink menus.  There was no description of the food or the price.  Our server did not describe anything to us.  The food was fine.  Some of the meat had a lot of fat but some of it was good.  We had one glass of wine, one ice tea and a dessert we split.  Our bill was $118.  That was way too expensive for what we got.  It's overpriced and the atmosphere is just ok.  We won't return."}
{"text":"Was so excited to dine here for my boyfriend's bday..made a reservation 4 days in advance. Got there 10 min before reservation and was told it would be 20 min. We had a party if 7 so we all just chatted while we waited . I lost track of time and noticed it was 725. Went up to desk and asked if we were going to be seated soon? Hostess said it would be shortly the table was being cleaned. At 735 we still hadn't been seated, I asked again and taking as told the ranges check was being given and it would be 5 min. ...at 745 we walked out after being ignored on the 3rd time at desk. This was a special day for my boyfriend and I was where he had been wanting to for months... horrible service and crappy excuses....in the 45 min we waited they say parties of 4, ,5 and 6 all while we waited ...why make a reservation if you get better service walking in....won't be returning..."}
{"text":"Myself and my family ate here last night for Mother's Day and myself and my daughter have severe food poisoning. For a restaurant that is supposed to be upscale and expensive I'm not impressed in any way with this restaurant and absolutely will not returning and will advice everyone I know not to eat there."}
{"text":"The food was very good. The salad bar was not as robust as other Brazilian steakhouses I've been to. The quality and selection of the meats was as good as any other Brazilian steakhouse. I had the Key Lime pie and it was super! There are certain cuts of meat that they only bring out on request. So if you see it on the menu but not on the floor, ask for it."}
{"text":"Sadly, I did not get to experience the food.  When I got to the restaurant, (we were going to be 4 peopIe) I waited a full 5 minutes to be acknowledged.  A couple came in after me.  Finally, someone came to the counter and ignored me, but greeted the people behind me and directed them to their table.  I asked him why the people came in behind me and took care of them first.  He said, \"oh, I welcomed everyone.\"  He still never bothered to ask how many.  He actually walked away and left me at the counter!   I left.  I really don't think it is worth going back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit.  We have been to the \"other Brazilian steakhouse\", so we knew we were in for a treat.  So glad to see this open up for us west-siders.  For those of you who remember, you'll find that they haven't changed much of the structure inside since the last restaurant that was at this address.  The wait staff was very attentive.  The food was excellent from the Parmesan filled rolls to the variety of meats that are brought in endless supply to the table on skewers. I believe that the umber of choices was a little low for us as we visited on a Monday evening.  I would expect that the weekend brings a lot more choices.  Still, that being said, we will certainly go again."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Brazilian steakhouse so I do not have anything to compare it to. However, I was very impressed with this place. I enjoyed all the meats they brought out, the servers were very attentive, and the restaurant looked clean and nice. They bring out cheese bread, fried bananas, and mashed potatoes with your food which all tasted really good. I would recommend this place and I will be back for special occasions. Only request I have is that they include dessert in full the experience option. Lastly, my two friends that were with our group that had been to other Brazilian steakhouses were bummed that this place did not have fried pineapples. One also mentioned that the salad bar was low on options compared to Rodizios and Fogo de Chao."}
{"text":"If there was something less than one star I would give that.  Took my mom here for her birthday tonight. It was great food with one issue the service or our server to be exact.  Can't remember her name but she was visibly pregnant and I get being a server in that state is hard but she was awful. She sat us down brought our drinks and then we never saw her again. Our drinks went dry and we waited 20 minutes and then flagged down a super nice girl who got us set up. After about 30 more minuets we wanted a dessert menu and drinks again and still no server finally found her talking to another coworker and  had to get up and go ask her for dessert menus and service.  She brought the menus over and never came back again. We had to again stop the really nice girl and ask her to take our order. We ask her if she could take over our table. She filled our drinks noticed it was my moms birthday and brought her dessert for free.  Thank God for the girl who went to Skyview Elementary wish I new her name. She should get recognized cause with out her the night would of been a total disaster.  Like I said good food but for the $$$$ I expect service too. Next time I'll drive to Fogo De Chao. To bad cause this is on our side of town."}
{"text":"Walking into this place I thought the atmosphere would be more up scale.  Tons of different meats service was fast. Only really liked the house special and the lamb. The flank steak had no flavor.  The little cheese rolls were awesome, salad bar, well I don't even dare touch salad  for $45 a person. I could have got a better meal at a steak house. So it was just me and my wife. We had two plates 1 desert, an ice tea and coffee. The bill came out to $111 not including tip. For that price I could have gone to most anywhere by arrowhead and save some money."}
{"text":"Ask for Jeff! Rest food bottomless meat and salads attentive waitstaff fast service! Wonderful creme brûlée! Wonderful a must try!"}
{"text":"At the time of this review Serra Gaucha Brazilian Steakhouse is newly opened in the P83 District across the street from Peoria Sports Complex. It differs from other Brazilian Steakhouses because it's independently owned. I haven't been to every Brazilian Steakhouse out there but I can tell you the salad bar is adequate enough but it doesn't compare to another  Brazilian Steakhouse I've been to. Everything I tried on the salad bar was very fresh tasting but I also have to add most of it was very bland. Some of the offerings were lunch meat and cheese, chicken salad, potato salad, fresh asparagus, hearts of palm, fresh beets, rice, black beans with pork.  At the table they start you off with Brazilian Cheese Bread, Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Caramelized Bananas. They also offer a full bar. Then when you turn your card to green the Gauchos (meat servers) come by with offerings. On my visit the meat selection was ....  Garlic Beef -too fatty for me....and maybe less than rare....I couldn't eat Leg of Lamb - I passed but my husband said was good Lamb Chops - we both passed Parmesan Pork - came at end ......passed Filet - mine was medium well-well done....ok........ Bottom Sirloin -   no flavor and over cooked Bacon wrapped Filet - was told medium rare but was well done Rib Eye - I passed but my husband thought it was extremely well done, dry and chewy Chicken Legs - not edible......tender but way over salted (hoping this was a slip) Pork Sausage OK ......juicy  Chicken legs wrapped in bacon....only tasted like bacon chicken inside was tasteless Signature Picanha Top Sirloin - VERY GOOD! Tender and flavorful delicious!  Everyone working there is a team that serves you. Everyone I encountered was pleasant and helpful.  I know at this time they are new and need a few more weeks to get things better.  Tons of potential 2.5 stars....rounded up because they are new and have potential since the Picanha was very good.  I wish them well and I am so happy they opened in this location because we don't have many nice restaurants in this area....but my review has to be honest and truthful."}
{"text":"Everything as expected, great. But recommend the staff to add the dessert things like grilled pineapple/banana/other sweet treats. Also, definitely gotta change those tong thingies. They were poor."}
{"text":"We had an anniversary and chose to let our inner Carnivore out...  and loved the place. Salad bar was ok, but not what we were here for. Enjoyed the various steaks, bacon wrapped chicken and the Parmesan crusted pork was over the top. Service was good, and we will go back. It's a bit pricey for a regular stop, but something we will keep in mind for company, or something special. All in all a very nice dining experience"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. We were seated promptly on arrival and served drinks quickly. Salad bar had a large variety and they tasted fresh and good. Fillet mignon, ribeye steak and the house special steak cuts were my favorites. This place is a must try for people who love meat. We left the restaurant fully satisfied and planning to go back soon"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food, excellent service & the staff makes you feel like family. I HIGHLY recommend visiting them, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Coming here was an very bad experience. I was patient and calm about my food. I ordered a well done steak and they brought me a rear steak and stated this was what I ordered and plastered it on my plate..I would never recommend this place to anyone!!! The waiter then had us wait several of minutes and even forgot about us when asked to bring the check"}
{"text":"We love Brazilian steakhouse style of eating and Serra Gaucha did not disappoint! Excellent service from the greeting all the way until the end of the meal!  Start your meal with a salad bar full of marinated mushrooms, pickled beets, cheeses, peppers, and an assortment of cold salads. Be sure to check the hot plates right behind the salad bar for hot beans and rice.   Then, turn your table card green, settle in at your table and let the feast to begin. Servers come to your table with the most delicious cuts of meat. Grab your tongs and pull the meat from the skewers as your servers slice as much or as little as you want. My personal favs are the lamb and house special. Seriously amazing!   Enjoy the cheese rolls, caramelized bananas, and garlic mashed potatoes served family style on your table. And remember to turn your table card red when you need to take a moment to digest.   Annnnnd save room for dessert. The flan was good but the strawberry cream (freshly made ice cream) was incredible."}
{"text":"We were looking for an alternative to driving to Scottsdale to that other place.  Serra Gaucha is every bit as good.  The food was AMAZING.  The meat was every bit as good as \"that other place\".  The salad bar was a little smaller, but what was there was of the highest quality.  And let's be honest, if you're coming for the salad, a Brazilian steakhouse may not be for you.  The service was far superior; all of the staff were amazing and very attentive.  I give it an A++++"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is fantastic. Love the selection of stuff to go with your meats. The service was great. I got the meat sweats later on. I championed through my dessert too, even though I had no room."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise.  Great salad bar, the meat is cut off skewers and there are so many different kinds.  They give you garlic mashed potatoes and fried bananas when you sit down.  The service is fantastic.  Lunch is $29.00 a person and dinner is $45.00 a person.  You totally get your moneys worth.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"First time it was my hubby Father's Day dinner.I was familiar with the concept and it didn't disappoint.The salad bar had cheeses, ham, rice, beans, chicken among other things. Very clean great choices.The meat selection was great, leg of lamb very good, I didn't like  the chicken wrapped in bacon, it was greasy and they taste was too strong. The lemonade is to die for, I would come back just for the lemonade. I recommend this place it's pricey so it's not like your everyday dinner."}
{"text":"Meats are Great but They keep coming around way to fast I'd like to enjoy each piece and savor the flavor.. prices are way to High The Brazilian Steakhouse in Scottsdale is way cheaper this place needs a way better Salad Bar not enough  To Waste Your money on"}
{"text":"The first disappointed is the salad is way too small and not a lot of option. Price is around $50 a person, however, it's not worth the price that me and my husband paying for. During our dinner, we cannot tell who is our server. A guy accident dumped ice tea into my water, and told me he would replace another glass of water for me, and I didn't see anyone bring my water back for more than 30 minutes. No one check on us if we need anything too.   Food is an okay, but like I said, it doesn't have a lot of option for you to choose.   I was excited to go here to try food since it's locally, however, after this I would rather drive to Scottdale to have dinner at Fogo de chao. Same price but way better"}
{"text":"Well seasoned, variety of cuts of meat that keep coming, friendly staff.  Note, call for reservations because the Yelp reservation service incorrectly said they were full."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Brazilian steakhouse! Went there back in March for my moms birthday and it was a gratifying experience! Will be returning, Thanks for the marvelous service!"}
{"text":"The place is great. Endless meats and salad bar. The staff is pretty prompt. I mean compared to Texas Roadhouse or black angus or anything of those steakhouse, this is a home run. Glad this place opened up on the West side of the city"}
{"text":"The amazing things first: A server named Pam, very pleasant and attentive. (There was one other male server who was good but I failed to get his name. All other servers were just ok.) The salad bar, side dishes were good and the rolls were great. We enjoyed the lamb and a couple of the beef dishes. The restaurant treated us to a dessert for our anniversary - nice touch.  Now the not so amazing things: the front hostess should be fired; we were not greeted when we walked in and had to wait for about 4 minutes for her to seat us. There were only five other occupied tables and we had reservations. Her attitude was poor with us and others. Several of the meats - pork and chicken were overcooked and dry."}
{"text":"Very very good Place ! Come and try it- excellent service and customer service . The meats are awesome even better that the other places Like Fogo ."}
{"text":"Quality of meats where fine but no where as good and tasty as other like Brazilian steak houses for the price.   Fogo De Cho, Texas De Brazil and others have much nicer inside, bigger and nicer salad bars and much, much better meat quality and taste  Service was good, but not great"}
{"text":"We checked out Serra Gaucha last Saturday evening (party of 6).  We had made reservations and were seated right away.  As we were walking to our table I noticed how close the tables were to one another.  This is not a place to come for the ambiance or décor.  There was not much room to maneuver your way through. Once we sat down I felt like our table was sitting on top of another table, etc..   Promptly greeted by our waiter who let us know that he would be tag teaming with another team member.  He explained how it all worked and we were on our way.  You begin with the salad bar and sides.  The salad bar sides were a bit disappointing.  Cold white rice and I can't even remember the other two sides.     Once we sat down they brought delicious cheese bread and garlic mashed potatoes.  One member of our party turned their card to green and the meat frenzy began.  It was almost like you were being attacked by meat. All the waiters walk so fast with the meat.  As I am the high maintenance meat eater, I asked for my filet to be well done if possible.  No problem it will take a while 15 minutes go by and I ask another person, same response - no problem will take a while.  Finally after asking the fifth person I received my well done filet.  It was good but was not a fan of waiting 30+ minutes for it.  The waiter brought over tequila shot as a make good.   It is expensive and the inside décor needs a bit of love.  Party of 6 with 2 bottles of wine ($30 range) was over $350.   Service was average.  It started off strong but declined throughout the evening. Favorite meats were House Special and the least favorite was the Chicken. The table enjoyed the cheese bread.  Dessert is an additional charge.  I have been to Fogo de Chao before and would drive there next time before coming back here."}
{"text":"Came here with one of our Meetup groups and was not impressed. The salad bar was very minimal and most of the items were straight out of a can. The beans were very bland as was the cheese bread they serve at the table. Most of the meats seemed to be of low quality and several were way too salty. I did enjoy the plantains and the chimichurri sauce however. In our opinion the price was too much for the quality of the food. Very disappointing as I was very excited to get one of these over on the west side and we were looking forward to not having to drive all the way to Scottsdale to visit the other one we enjoy going to."}
{"text":"I'm surprised! I was surprised that there was a Brazilian restaurant on the Westside. We came here this evening to celebrate some birthdays in the family.  Service the entire time was FANTASTIC! They were on top of everything. Everyone was helpful, very nice and always made sure there were fresh plates and refills always being brought by.  The bread was Amazing!  The sides that came with it were bananas and mashed potatoes. The potatoes were so good!!!  The salad bar was good. It was very clean and had a lot of variety. I just wish there were signs next to the food so we knew what was what. There was what I think was a chicken salad and maybe a potato salad that were so good.  There were some meats that were great and some that were just alright. The bacon wrapped chicken, sausage and the Brazilian house specialty that was so good. The waiter had mentioned 15 different meats going around but we didn't seem to see that many. The people going around with the meats were always bringing by fresh food! It was a great experience. VERY impressed by the workers there!"}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian, don't come here. Duh.  I enjoy this place for the food, wow what a concept. It's meat. The waiters come at you with swords and skewers and other sharp objects with meat.  Lots o meat.  I'm not sure if this is great for kids, but I like pretending I'm a dinosaur and the little pork weenie is Jeff Goldblum. The Filet Mignon is the best. The rinds of many of the steaks tend to the salty side, but yum."}
{"text":"First off it's very boring on the inside and has a cheap feel. The salad bar has no selection and lacks any creativity. The meat was good but they claim to have a large variety but they kept bringing us the same things over and over and didn't give us much is a selection. Overpriced for what they offer and I have no desire to ever go back"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service however was pretty awful. I had to ask three people for refills on drinks or to bring sides and each time it got passed to someone else. We got our drinks refilled 20min later and got our sides refilled at the end of dinner 5min before we paid. If you don't care about service then the food is good."}
{"text":"What a great find! We love the dining experience of a Brazilian steakhouse, but we haven't found any in the west valley. We went during the lunch period and made a reservation through yelp. A very positive experience.  The food was great and the service was prompt and friendly. The salad bar/ cold bar had a small selection but everything was good. The garlic mash potatoes and the fried bananas we also a great addition."}
{"text":"We've been to other Brazilian steakhouses and this one is so inferior! There were six of us on a Friday for lunch...the waiter completely forgot my beverage and when  I asked 20 minutes later, he said the tank was not working. The salad bar was nearly empty, mashed potatoes must have been instant and the gauchos came by with so few meats....nothing like other places..no lamb at all! Half the cost of the lunch price would have been too much. We would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Wow! Rivaled our Brazilian steakhouse experience on the Norweigan Epic. The service was incredible. You didn't have to ask for anything. They we're there before you even could think about needing it. The salad bar is amazing and I could have just eaten that but I would have missed the amazing meat selections. Our favorites were the top sirloin, ribeye, filet mignon, bottom sirloin, and bacon wrapped chicken. Definitely a place to come back to and I would highly recommend the experience if you haven't done it before."}
{"text":"The service was amazing, everyone friendly and helpful.  The salad bar isn't typical salad bar but very good, but whk goes to a steak house to eat salad.  (Helpful tip, don't fill up on salad)  The different meats, the courteous staff, what a great way to celebrate our anniversary.  They constantly bring you different meats to try.  Pricey but what good steak house isn't."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, excellent selection of meats/cuts and waitstaff was quick to assist and fulfill any particular meat request. The salad bar was less than the selection at the more well-known Scottsdale alternative, would not get your hopes up if you were planning the salad bar only option.  Here is why I still prefer the other place: - The former Elephant Bar decor is still very much a part of the ambiance. The waving fans on the ceiling, the giraffe print above the bar, the table layout. It feels incomplete. - The back half of the restaurant is blocked off with a large curtain. I believe they intend this to be for large groups but it looks out of place and had some lookie-loos peering behind the curtain.  - I heard the chime every time the oven timer rang and the view from my table was right into the dish-washing station. I am thankful for the job they do, being a former dish-washer myself, but it distracted from the experience.  There is something to be said about going into Scottsdale and getting a better ambiance for the price you are paying."}
{"text":"Good selections.  Love the pork ribs and beef ribs. Great dessert....molten chocolate. Excellent services."}
{"text":"Amazing in more ways than one! Decided to have lunch early afternoon at this new Brazilian Steakhouse and I'm glad we did. Parking was easy and there was plenty of it. They usually don't open for lunch on weekdays but I think there was some sort of event today. Upon entering we were seated quickly and was given a little brief on how they operate. Drinks were ordered and came fast. Started with the salad buffet and a couple of hot plates of black beans and rice. Then came the meat... all of which were cut to a decent size and cooked to our liking. From the bacon wrapped filet, top sirloin and flank steak to the delectable chicken hearts and filet mignon... it was all mouthwatering and delicious! I cannot forget about the all you can eat sides! The cheesy Brazilian bread is my all time favorite. The other sides of the fried bananas and mashed potatoes were pretty decent. I would give the service 6 stars if I could. They refilled our drinks often, swapped out new plates during the right time. Overall very helpful and attentive! One of the owners, Albert, came by after we were finished our meal and we conversed about the background of the restaurant and how it all began. If you have never tried a Brazilian Steakhouse or have driven by this establishment contemplating if you should go...take the leap! It was a wonderful experience and I know I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Good service very overcooked meat, horrible looking salad bar. The salad bar was so sad looking , wilted salad, cheap options . There was no one at the salad bar because it was terrible . Restaurants like fogo have top shelf salad bar . This is just a dud"}
{"text":"Fantastic! We had a large-party gathering and we were very well taken care of during our meal. The service was exceptional. The meat selections were fresh, savory, and diverse. I loved the salad-bar, but my only suggestion would be to label a few of the dishes at the salad bar. The dressings were not labeled so it was a trial-error experience. There were also a few side salads that I was unsure of and so I didn't try them. The atmosphere was lovely but tables a little close together so didn't provide a clear path to the salad bar which probably was bothersome to those sitting nearby. Altogether, a great place to celebrate and enjoy the Brazilian steakhouse experience. Price was high but quality of meat made it worth it."}
{"text":"There is no way this place even comes close to Fogo de Chao. Also, for the price just go to Fogo and get the full experience and better tasting meats and bigger salad bar. I don't know how someone can go to Fogo and then try SG and say Fogo sucks. After reading that it's really hard to take peoples reviews serious.   I'd be willing to try again if they do a serious make over on a lot of their stuff!"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 10 for a graduation dinner. We were seated very promptly. The waiter was engaging and attentive. The salad bar and meats were spectacular. The side dishes of garlic mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas disappeared quickly, and were replaced just as fast by the attentive waiters. The ham put Honey baked to shame. The cream brûlée is made in house and the best I have ever had. We plan on going back, frequently."}
{"text":"This was a really fun experience.  We went at lunch time on a weekday and took advantage of the 1/2 price cost, making us able to include our children.  The service was excellent, could not have asked for kinder, more attentive service.  My 11 year old son even noticed how good our server was, which is out of character for him.  The one downer, not all of the food on the salad bar was fresh.  It looked like it was all prepped last night and wrapped on the platters for placement in the am.  For some foods that would be okay, but many of the foods looked soggy and unappetizing. If I paid $14.95 for salad bar only, I would have been very unhappy, but we were there for the meat, so I wasn't too disappointed by the salad bar.  Overall, we really enjoyed the variety of meats.  There were 2 carvers, so there was never a moment that we were not being served.  The servers were very informative and patient with our children.  My husband and I agreed that the bacon-wrapped meats all took on the same flavor, so those were not our favorites, but most of the steaks were really good, the lamb was seasoned well and my youngest loved the Parmesan crusted pork. The mashed potatoes were good, but unnecessary with all of our other food. Overall, I give the service 5+ stars, and the food 3 1/2 stars, but the service was so good, I wouldn't want to lower the rating, and the experience was so fun that I would go back (for lunch prices), even though not everything was excellent."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday night for our anniversary. Not busy, maybe 3-4 other guest dining. Walked in, and was not incredibly impressed with the atmosphere. It felt very unfinished, like the decorating was skipped to pay for other things.  The waiter we had was extremely friendly and attentive. He explained the process throughly and check on us constantly throughout the night.   You will have access to an unlimited salad bar, that has a variety of cold veggies and pastas. As well as waiters bringing different cuts of meat to your table that you can accept or decline. The Salad bar was just okay, nothing to impressive there. A lot of it was pasta salad, cut up veggies, rice, etc. I wish there was more HOT veggies there, but everything including the grilled veggies were ice cold.   The meats that the waiters brought to your table were cooked to different degrees (rare, medium rare, medium, well, etc.) The restaurant had a fair selection of different cuts of steaks, chicken, and lamb. The only thing is the flavor was not always there, I almost wish they provided different sauces to dip the meats in.   The price came to roughly $50 per person, which isn't terrible. I do think it needs to have a little bit more pizazz for that amount of money with ambiance and food. However, you can definitely make your money's worth if you eat your little heart out."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Serra Gaucha in Peoria for Mother's Day. I honestly didn't think they would be busy, but they were packed. We never been to a Brazilian steakhouse. Man this is unreal there are SO many different meats. I struggle to eat all of them, because you have a salad bar so you don't know where to begin. We love this place. Don't know much about Brazilian culture, but the restaurants are fantastic.  One I thing I recommend is going in hungry, the whole unlimited meats is overwhelming, in a good way! They have this drink , I forgot what's it called but it's like a margarita but better and they are strong, we were told it's Brazilian rum that gives it the kick.   Our meat server Tristin was really nice. You guys gotta try the Papaya cream , definitely a treat for the taste buds. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my son's favorite places, so we are here often for special occasions - birthdays, Mother's Day, etc.   It's slightly more casual than Fago de Chao, but the meats are equally good and less expensive.   They have a great salad bar - full of yummy roasted veggies, salads, cheeses and other delights.  But the star of the show is the roasted meats on a spit, brought to your table.   We love the garlic beef, the house beef, and the lamb chops. I would be rating them a 5 except they were out of lamb chops on our last visit.   They have a wonderful bar/beverage menu and a great dessert menu.    Service has been great as well. Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Best place where you and your family can eat at! 15 delicious cut of meat.. varying from beef, lamb, pork, and chicken. The ambience of the place is amazing! You can bring your significant other to eat, enjoy, and have memorable night together."}
{"text":"Hubby & I just happened to run across this place the day before.t hey open.Some employees were standing outside the front door, we asked if/when they open. They told us about the Grand Opening tomorrow, just reservations.(We had reservations for our regular place in Scottsdale, canceled to try Serra.) I contacted the restaurant via email and got a response/ reservation for what we needed. The place is in the old Elephant Bar on the Westside. Everyone on staff was friendly and helpful, entertaining and attentive.We met 2 of the partners and enjoyed hearing their start up story. The menu is the standard Brazilian fare of delicious meat delivered to your table on skewers.! ... don't forget the cheese bread!!!The salad bar was filling and good selection of items. We spent almost 3 hours there. Thank you to Hailey,Emilio and the management for delivering a great opening night experience . We plan on returning soon!"}
{"text":"Every bite was delicious, every employee friendly & helpful. We'll definitely be back. Still full from last night"}
{"text":"Who books a wedding reception on Mother's Day?!  Horrible experience...got up and left.  Had to wait over 15 mins for salad bar...finally got out of line because by time you got up there they were pulling what you wanted to refill it but did not immediately replace it.  The manager said there was nothing he could do??  Should have never booked a wedding party on Mother's Day to begin with.  Will not go back!"}
{"text":"I love that they have this place on the West Side! Finally a place that is nice and filling. I love their salad bar. I could eat the mini mozarella cheese all day! Everything was very fresh and delicious. The meat that came around was just amazing as well! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for a special celebration instead of the Brazilian Steakhouse in Scottsdale as it is much closer to our home.  So glad we decided to try Serra Gaucha!  We had a full experience dinner.  Started with the salad bar which had a lot of lovely choices..a variety of different salads along with cold meats and cheese.  The salad bar was good, but the selection of steaks and meats from the Gaucha's were OMG AMAZING.  I lost track of what was what, but I will say that the beef selections were all melt in your mouth delicious.  The leg of lamb was also so good.  We asked for some sauces for the table and were brought a selection of horseradish sauce, A1, chimichurri, and a hot sauce.  The chimichurri was my favorite...amazing on the lamb especially.  I have to give a shout out to the Gaucha's also, as they were SO FRIENDLY and helpful and HAPPY! We did have two different servers coming to our table and they were both excellent.  After the main course my stomach was ready to burst, but we still split a creme brulee.  It was huge and lovely and a large portion for each of us.  Perfect to share.  I left there in a serious food coma.  We will def be back. I'm editing to add a word about the sides - mashed potatoes and sauteed bananas (yummy) but the best side was those little Parmesan biscuits.  They pack a punch of cheesy goodness!"}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY love this restaurant. The waiters are fun and VERY nice!! The meat is excellent and so many cuts! We really enjoyed dining there! I give 4 stars only because I wish there was more on the buffet for the sides. The cheese looks like its been sitting for awhile also."}
{"text":"Came here for mother's day.   First the pros-  - lots of food! - the salad bar was great! - they have Xingu!  Cons-  - Service was terrible, our waiter had an attitude and said everything was included, which dessert, we found out, was not included.  - The meat had little flavor and what flavor it did have tasted the same for every cut.   I was so excited to try this place but it was an incredible and expensive let down.   I will not be coming back any time soon, nor will I recommend this place to anyone. I don't see it lasting too long."}
{"text":"This was very promising at first. We have been to a Brazilian steakhouse before in Vegas and wanted to try another, we were very disappointed in this restaurant. They have a salad bar option only, it was more expensive then what was advertised on their website. I had also asked about dessert being included in that option and the waiter said no it is not included in the salad bar option. It was not mentioned at that time that dessert was not included in either option just the salad bar one. My husband sat for a while waiting for a refill and the same meats kept being brought to us, not the variety that they were supposed to have. We felt rushed out the restaurant and pushed out the door and when it came time for dessert we were told it was not included which was the only reason I choose the \"full experience\" option.  Nothing was communicated to us about what was included or even the prices (I had to ask). They need to be more clear on what's included and not included in both options. We were not even shown a drink list, wine list or anything! Very upset with this place, with the cost of what we paid was not worth it, we have been to better."}
{"text":"One of the most wonderful restaurant in the world salad bar is exquisite meat is delicious staff friendly professional I just love it"}
{"text":"This was such an amazing experience. The staff was wonderful. The atmosphere was relaxing and the food was even better. I would absolutely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever been to a Brazilian steak house and let me tell you I was impressed! Growing up in a meat market as a child Im obviously a carnivore, so this place is ideal for me! All of their meats were delicious! So well prepared, great service! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing, especially for the money. A group of 7 adults and 2 kids came in on Christmas eve for my father in law's birthday. I was sure I couldn't eat enough meat to make the $45 buffet price worth it so I opted for the salad bar at $25 I believe. The salad bar was to come with hot items as well as a salad bar. The hot items included incredibly salty black beans, white rice, and a chicken dish (maybe carbanara??) which was just okay. They had three types of lettuce mixes and a pre-mixed ceasar which was not bad. There were cooked/chilled veggies including mushrooms and zucchini as well as a pasta salad, potato salad, and apple salad. The salad bar overall was nothing special and I would say that Ruby Tuesday actually has more options and is no where near the price. Nothing was labeled, it would be helpful to know what we were eating in advance. We were told there would be over 40 types of meats plus sides for the full price. We were brought out the fried bananas and garlic mashed potatoes (2 sides of each), neither were refreshed even after the potatoes were finished. There were fewer than 15 meat options actually offered, several duplicates. My husband found that most of the options lacked flavor or were fatty, only really enjoying the Parmesan chicken and prime rib. We were offered a free desert for the birthday, my father in law opted for the creme brulee, which was fine, nothing special. Overall every person in our party was disappointed with the food and we had frequently flag down servers for food or service throughout the meal. This does not even begin to compete with Fogo and I would not recommend it to anyone. The decor is really sad, you can tell it is in an old Elephant Bar because none of the decor has changed and it desperately is in need of some updates/upgrades."}
{"text":"Food was great, lots of options on the salad bar and with the meats offered. Service was not great. We had to ask multiple times to get drink refills, dessert, and the check. It was like once we flipped our meat card to red, our table became invisible."}
{"text":"5 stars and we didn't make it to the 2nd course!  Greeted at the site by a charming gentleman holding the door. Quick seating by the waitress and we went to get salads. It was at this time we had to make a quick exit. We asked for our check and the manager came over to make sure we were not leaving unsatisfied. He would not let us pay. (We'd Sat, ordered drinks and gotten some food. Hadn't hardly touched our plates. Left a healthy tip and ran out the door! Amazing customer service! To be continued... We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a weekday lunch. I have to say I was hesitant about this place, having been to Fogo De Chao before. Note, we did go towards the very end of the lunch time. The service was amazing!!! The staff made the experience! Nothing but good words towards them. The meat choices were nothing short of amazing (and some cuts were better than fogo). Where they start to lack compared to other Brazilian steakhouse experiences I've had, was the salad bar. It was good but had nothing worth writing home about and I wish it was a little larger. Not a big issue for me, but if someone wasn't a huge meat eater it would have been nice for them."}
{"text":"Excited to have a Brazilian steakhouse on the west side. Staff was very attentive and personable. Salad bar was good but not anything special or worth the $$. Meats were just ok. Pork and bacon wrapped filet were over cooked and dry. Lamb chops were over cooked as well. Some of the sirloin options were tasty. The filet was brought out after we were all done eating and looked good, but we were too full to eat more. I had to complain several times because it was so warm in the restaurant that we were very uncomfortable. Desserts were good especially the flan. Overall it was a nice dinner but not worth what we paid for sure. We will drive to Scottsdale if we want to go to a Brazilian steakhouse in the future."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing, everyone is quick to react to any request and will make sure the meat you desire gets brought to your table in a very timely fashion.   The food was wonderful, the meat very tender and tasty.  A particular standout was Tristin, he went out of his way to make sure I got to taste a bit of everything and it was a breath of fresh air to see someone take such ownership of their job responsibilities."}
{"text":"My husband and I thought we would try this new restaurant in our area. Greeted by what we assumed to be the owner and by several friendly staff.  We both agreed the friendliness of the staff was noticeably a step up from most restaurants. There was no menu or pricing - since we had not been there before we assumed it was expensive and left it at that. Trip to the vegetable, fruit and hot sides bar was interesting - my husband does not care for veggies and was looking forward to the fruit the server stated would be found but there was no fruit. Later we found out she meant the whole fruit that appeared to be decor which is why we didn't dream of taking it. The meats came by and we were advised there were 15-16 types and if we thought we missed one, to let the server know but we didn't know what was being served so we didn't know what we could have missed. We then asked if there was a list and advised to look on their website. We had a fantastic dessert Brazilian flan and strawberry cream.  We had ice tea and Diet Coke only. Then we were presented with a $122.00 and honestly had stomach cramps walking back to the car, had issues later that night and do not plan on returning. Sorry."}
{"text":"This place is like Fogo Brazilian Steakhouse in Scottsdale, but in the West Valley.   They bring loads of different carved meats to your table, it's fantastic if you are doing the Keto or Atkins {high protein diet!} I think the bread on the table was gluten-free?  The staff was friendly and quick. The meats were really tasty!  Salad bar was good, but I didn't want to load up on veggies, etc."}
{"text":"So very sorry to have to rate this new restaurant so poorly....but we were so looking forward to our dinner here and we were so greatly disappointed. My husband and I had a fantastic dining experience at Fogo de Chao last week in Scottsdale so when  a group of friends asked us to join them for dinner Saturday night I recommended Serra Gaucho. Coming from the west side I excitedly told them about the new Brazilian Steakhouse on P83 and after our great meal at Fogo we were looking forward to this. To start with the bar service was terrible. We waited quite a while for our drinks. During this time a server said we could go to the salad bar...never explained the \" gaucho\" dining experience. The other guests had never been to a  Brazilian Steakhouse. Finally our server returned with our cocktails and explained the procedure.  The salad bar was just ok...beans and rice were awful. Marinated items were good...salads good.  The true issue was the meat!! Except for two or three items...bottom sirloin, filet and bacon wrapped filet, meats were of poor quality. Tasteless( except for special of the house which was sos so salty)..stringy and tough. So so disappointing. Many were cold. Coffee service was nonexistent. Had to flag someone down to remove salad plates and provide fresh ones since the \" gauchos\" did not do this. Also had to flag someone down for the filet and lamb chops. David...the one server who truly was excellent...did his best. Looked like he was trying to pick up the slack all over...and with a dimpled smile!! Servers were rushed and inattententive...seemed overwhelmed. Had to search for David( not our server) for dessert. Again...plates sat and sat at our table even though red tickets were all up. Dessert order finally taken by someone but again..coffee service non existent. We ordered several creme  brûlées were out of them by 7:00 on a Saturday night. The bill, with drinks, over $ 150 per person. I know this is a new venture for the owners but just not up to par.  Sorry to say none of us will return and we are sorry for we really all want to support P 83 restaurants."}
{"text":"Terrible service and meat that all sort of tasted the same will be the main reason I don't go back.   Pros:  Salad bar was very good Items were high quality (prosciutto, moz, olives, veggies) Xingu on the menu (try it if you haven't) The steaks were the best tasting - juicy and tender Desserts were delicious (key lime pie and flan.) After complaining about the service, the manager did make it right.  Cons:  Terrible service if seated in the bar - seriously the waiter couldn't be found for drink refills, plate removal, or the check (had to finally ask a manager for the check after looking for our waiter for 15 mins.)   Meat tasted the same and some was badly overcooked (bacon wrapped chicken, sausage, ribs.) There was little to no seasoning on anything.   Waiter misled about dessert costs - never provided a menu or dessert or indicated it was extra. Add another $8.00 per dessert to your bill. It was deceitful (but see point one about terrible service.)  No doggie-bag policy is BS! The idea is to sample the 14+ meats, but not all are liked or fully consumed. Our table had gathered a pile of left overs that we wanted to take as treats to the dogs. Waiter refused and pulled attitude. I PAID for that food and should be able to take it away. Some people might abuse that, but most would not. Throwing it away is wasteful. Get me a d@mn box!  The food is not very kid friendly, so charging half price for food more geared to adults isn't a good value. What 8 year old eats $24 worth of meat?  The ambiance of this place is left over Elephant Bar. I felt like I was eating in a repurposed restaurant.  Parking is terrible on a weekend night (but that's this whole area.)  Recommendations:  Given the cost of $45/person at night plus drinks and dessert, I'd skip and go to an upscale steak restaurant with a good view and pristine service.   If you do want to go, hit the place up for lunch when it's cheaper and the tired interior doesn't feel as used.  I'd be surprised if this place survives 2 years."}
{"text":"Went for lunch 7/26/17 and received warm greeting and door opening. Good start. The old Elephant Bar has been transformed into a spacious tables and side booths dining area, but lacks any hint of Brazilian decor or stains of Brazilian music--they can easily fix this and I trust they do. We'd never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before, so were not aware that there are no menu choices except if you just wanted the salad bar the price would be $14.95 (quite steep for lunch--$10 for P83 Entertainment District--we're not Scottsdale, and for that size of a salad bar and the all you could eat meat was $28.95. We're used to all-you-can-eat, choices galore buffets like Golden Corral where for less than $15 at the right time will net you freshly sliced steak, so the prices startled us, but we were there for the experience, which it was. However, maybe they could devise some mini-version for lunch; they could do it per piece like at a Dim-Sum restaurant where cards get punched per item. That would be such fun and add to a casual lunch-time atmosphere and differentiate it from dinner. We were walked through the salad bar (one large table and two side stations of black beans and rice) by an attentive staff member, which was nice, but it's a lot of info to take in and I'd rather have good signage. Everything looked fresh and were artistically arranged, but nothing was particularly unique except some generous slices of cheeses (btw, should be covered or they will dry out) one of which had a tangy bite to it and the hearts of palm.  Once seated, we were brought some warm cheesy rolls in muffin shapes with a texture like a chewy popover: very tasty! My friend ordered a bottle of Xingu Brazilian beer for $6--ouch!  Two little colored cards were on our table and we were told once we switch from the red side to the green, the meat would be brought to us. I was just having the salad bar, but my friend flipped his card to green and then the parade of meat began for him. Fresh off the barbecue rotisserie and still on the skewer came a variety of cuts ranging from filet mignon to ribeye to ribs, meat wrapped in bacon, meat coated visible garlic that was so aromatic it made me salivate, and so many more that I lost track. There were also pork ribs, sausage, and chicken. My carnivorous friend was in heaven with meat so tender he said he barely had to chew it. This was obviously top quality meat, perfectly prepared, and he enjoyed the participatory nature of looking at the cut of meat and deciding if he wanted a well-done or rare slice, and he had to use the little tongs to hold it while the server cut it to order. He was also brought side dishes of a sliced and caramelized plantain, and mashed potatoes (I was hoping for some roasted colorful mini potatoes since that seems it would be a good additional use for the rotisserie and in keeping with a South American cultural homage (their brochure uses phrases like \"cultivating the tradition inherited from our ancestors\" and being \"proud to be a place where you can live and spread the culture of those who love the authentic tradition,\" so celebrating the heritage varietals of potatoes would be an excellent touch).  We are so glad we went to this very pleasant escape from the ordinary, but they need to add a little more atmosphere, and I wish they would institute the Dim-Sum approach for lunch as I proposed since I can neither eat enough to justify the cost (they are a great candidate for local coupons, Living Social, Groupon, etc. so hope to see them there, esp.  to acquaint local residents to them) and I don't know many around here who could, esp. for lunch. BTW, staff member (oh, and they all worked together in effective and pleasant manner) informed me there is no difference for dinner, except the prices go up.... Good luck to them!"}
{"text":"If you've been to fogo de chao I think you'll be disappointed. For starters, the ambiance here sucks. It feel like you're in some awkward banquet room. No decor, plastic banner outside for a sign, no feeling of any privacy... the bar is bare.... literally feels like you're at a less private old country buffet. Which makes it feel so 'westside' as an imitation of a nicer place in Scottsdale. The drink menu is not comparable to fogo, nothing 'good' or cute and girly. The buffet is smaller, nothing good on there, minimal stuff. The meat they bring around is good, I like how you see it cooking at fogo better. It's cool to try a variety of things.... the pork and chicken was all over done. House sirloin and filet mignon are good if you can get them at your table. If you're looking for the fill experience, spent the extra $8 and drove out to Scottsdale.... it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is place is still pretty new at the time of my first visit. All and all exactly what I expected. It is my second experience at a Brazilian steak house my first was at a well known establishment in Las Vegas. Naturally my comparisons of this place are compared to that. All and all very well done (pun intended). Man oh man some of the cuts of meat were so tender I swear the meat fell apart the moment it hit the lips. So tasty. NY strip, fillet minon, pork covered in Parmesan, top round, pork ribs etc. Oh man the food was good. Their salad bar was also tasty. Well worth the experience. The good thing is being a new establishment such as this starting out so good is hopefully they keep getting better and better. The west side needs these kind of attractions.   My only advice was the walls were kinda bare. The tables were set very fancy and the staff was the best but the decor was kinda bland. But hey if that's the only complaint I got I guess they're doing pretty dang good."}
{"text":"We came for lunch at opening. Everything was tasty. My favorite was the lamb. They have an awesome salad bar too. It is all you can eat so come hungry. The service we had was 5 stars from everyone."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely exceptional. The food was so flavourful. I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Outstanding experience for the second time (we loved it a couple days ago too)! Wait staff exceptional. Food delicious and great variety. Cooked to perfection. A new favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"OMG... Everything was great. The food was to die for with so many amazing and tasty meats. The service was just as good and went above and beyond my expectations.   I made reservations asking for a quiet table and letting them know it is my wife's birthday. We had a nice comfortable table and everyone was telling her Happy Birthday from when we got there until we left...   The hardest part was leaving. I was so full but all the great food still being brought past our table made me wish I had a bigger appitite... We will be back soon for sure..."}
{"text":"Another name for this place should be the fake Fogo. If you are familiar with Fogo De Cao then this place, for the same price, will not be worth the visit. Staff isn't as professional, food quality isn't a good and the salad bar had some old items at 6pm on a weekend. If you have never been to a Brazilian steakhouse you may enjoy this but if you have this place isn't worth it."}
{"text":"No prices on th menu.  We had two beers and dinner and it came to $107.  Dinner consists of a salad bar where nothing is labeled a small plate of mashed potatoes to share and a small plate of fried bananas.  Then when you're ready you flip over a card and waiters start bringing over and cutting pieces of various meats off which you grab with a pair of tongs. Turn the card over again and they stop.  Some of the meat was hot and good but some was lukewarm and tough.  Hosestly, it's just an extremely overpriced buffet.  If you're going to stay for three hours it might be worth it.  But for two people with normal appetites it's a resounding no.  Also people stare at you while you're eating waiting for you to flip your card over.  Annoying.  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We had been to Fogo before and liked the food but we are definitely not the Scottsdale \"type\" and never went back.  When Serra Gaucha opened we were very excited to try it.  We went there for our anniversary and they did not disappoint!   The food was remarkable.  All the proteins were delivered hot, fresh and so flavorful.  I had to keep turning my card to RED because it was just never-ending and we couldn't keep up!!    I tried a Caipirinha from the bar and am now obsessed with them!  The servers were spot on and seem to have been trained very well for all the things they are responsible for.   I would definitely recommend this place !"}
{"text":"Went in tonight to check it out since there doesn't appear to be any Brazilian BBQ places on the  west side. I was surprised it wasn't busier for a Friday night but it's still new and there is a lot of places to eat in the area. I'm hoping they will start getting more business and stick around, it's nice having this place as opposed to having to drive out to Scottsdale.   I'm a huge fan of Fogo De Chao and every location I've eaten at across the country has been great so they are my yard stick when it comes to Brazilian BBQ and most places don't really hold up in my opinion. This one on the other hand does. I'll give the slight edge on the meats and cheese bread to Fogo, but the garlic mashed potatoes and fried bananas are better here. Service was excellent, especially Demi who checked on us regularly and was very helpful with information and keeping our table set. Really everyone we had contact with was very nice and service was excellent. The food was also great and I would have no reservations about coming back here instead of driving out to Scottsdale for dinner.   Check this place out and bring your appetite."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a brazilian steakhouse. The food was amazing!!! I was totally impressed by the entire experience. You definitely have to give it a try:)"}
{"text":"Too start with, we had eight people and all of their tables in the main dining area seem to be set for four. We had to sit \"behind the curtain\" which made is seem like part of a conference room at a hotel, rather than nice restaurant. They need to re-think that.   The meat is the star of this restaurant, which is as is should be. They had two filet  mignons (one bacon wrapped and cooked medium well- the other cooked medium). They are both tasty, even though cooking a filet past medium is a sin of some sort. The Top Sirloin and Rib Eye are also just delicious. Their house sirloin is packed with flavor, and was quite surprising.  They have these cheesy rolls as a side and garlic mash which are both really flavorful, so be careful! You aren't paying $50 for starches.  The salad bar is nowhere near what they have at Fogo De Chao, but that is a sucker's play anyway. There is an ample selection of items to put on a salad, plus some cured meat and cheese selections, black beans and rice. More than enough considering why you are here.  This, like Fogo, is a place you go when you want meat, and lots of it. Otherwise, it is too pricey to make sense. I am glad it is in the area, as I won't have to trek to Scottsdale anymore!  The bill for two of us at the end of the night was $150 with tip. Considering that we aren't shy about the beer and wine, it was money well spent!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with quality and service. Just moved from San Francisco and was hoping for the best. I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Brazilian steakhouse was fabulous no need to go to Scottsdale! This place has all the best dishes from Brazil!"}
{"text":"I was happy to see this place open up in Peoria, since the only Brazilian steakhouses I've been to have all been in Vegas.  And for that reason, my expectations were set pretty high.    The food was excellent, the wine list was decent and included a number of things I've never tried, and the atmosphere was conducive to good conversation.    Dinged them one star because the prices were Vegas prices, not Peoria prices. A little steep for the average night out with friends.  But if you're hungry for some amazing food, and you're a baller with cash to throw around, this is the spot."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! The service started off ok but declined rapidly. We were asked if we wanted dessert before we ever got a plate for meat. Had to flag waiter down for water refill and sides. Never did that waiter return to refill drinks. Thank goodness for Miles and Nino or we wouldn't have had anything to drink or sides!!    So by the end of the meal we weren't happy with the service and the food was just mediocre. I agree with one of the other reviews. Tables were too close and it was difficult to get to salad bar.   We asked for a Manager. The hostess said she would get him. He walked around the front of the restaurant, she pointed us out. He walked behind us turned around and walked to the back. So we had to ask for the Manager a second time. He was referred to as the owner and sent one of the waiters on the floor over to speak to us. The waiter/acting Manager was able to speak to us in a Manager capacity. So we voiced our concerns and major disappointment. We were offered a 25% off our meal next time we come and this time was on them.   It was explained that we don't have designated waiters but it was interesting how every table around us was serviced more than once by the same server we had.   Very unprofessional to be a Manager or owner and not be concerned enough to speak to your patrons when they request to talk with a Manager. Not a great way to start off a new restaurant!   People take the extra drive and go to Fogo De Chao it's worth the $5 extra bucks a plate and the drive!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  The food is wonderful.  The service is great!  David is such an asset to this restaurant.  We celebrate our anniversaries here and we will be back!  We love this place!  Thank you David for your wonderful service!  We love to come here with and without the kids!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at several other Brazilian steakhouses, I would certainly not recommend this one. Majority of the meats were very tough and chewy. The level of service was not as expected either. Wife ended up getting sick when we arrived home shortly after dining."}
{"text":"This is the best Brazilian Steakhouse in AZ! So glad one opened up on the west side and much better then Fogo De Chao. The salad bar had more offerings and tasted better. The meats were to die for."}
{"text":"Great food, we enjoyed everything we tried. A decent wine list. Excellent service, warm and inviting atmosphere, and a great value."}
{"text":"Love that we have a Brazilian Steakhouse on the west side. The food was fantastic and the service could not have been any better. Love the bacon wrapped chicken but all of the steak cuts were fantastic. Tried my first cut of lamb as well and will be having that again. Don't forget to leave room for dessert- we had the flan and creme brûlée and both were fantastic. Strongly recommend checking it out if you are in the mood for lots of meat and lots of variety."}
{"text":"We frequent Fogo often so thought we'd give Serra Guacha a try since it's on our side of town. We were pleasantly surprised with our experience. Everyone was friendly and helpful and the meats came around quick and were overall great in flavor! The assortment of meat was awesome and price was comparable to other Brazilian steak houses. The only improvement would maybe be to the decor. The inside of the restaurant seems kinda incomplete and rushed. Still looks like Elephant Bar but now Serra guacha took over the building but didn't update anything. Other than that, we enjoyed our visit! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  We just don't have a good waitress.  She went on her lunch break right after gave our bill!!! Don't think we will go back ..."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about coming because I heard how overrated other Brazilian steakhouses were, but I am so mad that I waited so long to come here. The food was amazing and they bring you whatever you request from their selection. The service was wonderful, they were friendly and made the experience even more memorable. I can't wait to take my parents here!"}
