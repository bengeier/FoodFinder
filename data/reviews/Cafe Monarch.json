{"text":"Best restaurant in Scottsdale! The food was perfect and the wine pairing was even better. The wines Stephen chose were amazing! We had dinner in the patio, which was lovely. The only thing that wasn't perfect was the noise level in the patio. There were a few groups and they were too loud, it took away from the ambiance."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend there for his birthday and the food was absolutely amazing!  The owner Christian was so wonderful and even gave us a tour of the kitchen. The food was perfectly prepared with perfect pairings of wine. I would recommend it to anyone and we will be back there again very soon."}
{"text":"One of the most amazing foods I have had in a long time. The place is also very charming and romantic, with a very professional and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Valentines Day   I was late in searching for a venue but did find Monarch Cafe which is highly rated. They said they were booked but would call me if anyone cancels. They called me on the day of and asked me if I wanted 9pm. I took it. This meal was priced at 100 per person.  We arrived but the lot was full so we parked on the street. During the walk to the restaurant I realized we had to walk on the street for part of the way(no sidewalk, just dirt) and there is a 7-eleven about 500 feet away. The place itself is a converted house of so it seems. We were early for our \"reservation\" but were seated 30 minutes after the appointed time. We were then seated. I noticed not many people were dressed for a special occasion as we were. The place was crowded and were were seated very close to others. The was no intimacy. The staff and food were excellent. We were offered side dishes but were not informed of the cost so we thought they were a part of the four course meal.  In total, the bill was 300.00 including tip. All in all, I would not come back for valentines day but perhaps for a non-special occasion.  This is due to the location, and the cattle-like feeling I felt not being able to justify the cost."}
{"text":"i am not sure what all the HYPE is about. the food is acceptable. the best part of the evening was our server Stephen. if you go off the menu and order cocktails it is extremely overpriced for what you are getting. with all the choices in the valley, this would not be more than a one time shot for the four of us that went"}
{"text":"Wow. Very romantic terrace seating. The food was amazing. Go with the wine pairing. They have picked the perfect compliment to each course. The staff is very knowledgeable and attentive. If you are in the area this restaurant is a must."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to catch Christopher right when he opened up the shop on a weekday.  We were able to talk to him while he finished setting up -he is the chef, the busboy, the owner, the operator, he does it all- is a GREAT guy, and after tasting his food, he is also a culinary artist. The food was as beautiful to look as it was to eat and a good value for what you get."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! Took my wife here for her birthday (after the fact as I was out of town and had a lot to make up for) and it was just what I needed not only to hit the spot but also to get some much needed brownie points.   Food was fantastic!  Would have liked to have some options to be able to split some of the food on the menu but we still had a great time and enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch is the best restaurant we've been to in Scottsdale. Ambiance was cozy and romantic, service was excellent, and food was incredible. We thoroughly enjoyed each course of the New Year's Eve menu. Our waiter, a sommelier, was clearly passionate about the restaurant. Would go back in a heartbeat! Also- my husband and I are gluten free, which is often an inconvenience when eating out. Not only did our waiter assure us that he could accommodate any dietary restriction, he also explained how each course would be modified to make it gluten free! Hoorah!!"}
{"text":"Took my wife and two friends to Monarch for wife's birthday back in April and had a wonderful experience. We arrived too early and it kind of threw Christopher off a bit. Wasn't sure how long it would take to get there, but he took it in stride and greeted us warmly. Love the concept and the atmosphere here, completely relaxed vibe but still upscale enough and a perfect celebration spot.  Food is good, but Christopher and the restaurant itself are the real stars here. When we visited there was no assistant and somehow Christopher was able to talk with all of his tables and still put out high quality plates. Makes dinner a more intimate experience, which is exactly what a birthday dinner with friends calls for. Wife and i had fish and our friends had lamb chops. Meats were prepared well and tasted good, but the times between plates, sipping wine and looking over the fire are the reason we will be back. If you have a few bottles of wine that you have been saving for a great meal/experience with friends, give Christopher a call and make plans to visit Cafe Monarch soon!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've had in Scottsdale. The menu frequently changes based on what is seasonal. The wine pairings with the meal were amazing as well. A true culinary experience."}
{"text":"My gosh!My first time back to visit since my reception. Okay service so flawless you did not even know when a entree arrived or the empty plate was taken away.......That is how flawless the service is!!!!!!! All of the entree's were great this evening. I chose the Filet of Beef, WOW!!!! cooked perfect! Our other guest had the Tuna. She just ate that down!!!!! Oh what I enjoyed was this Cauliflower soup that was out of this world! I will never have anything like that soup again. It was 10+ . I love this place because it takes you out of Arizona........If you go you will see the ambiance . Won't give it away.......Want to go w/ friends GREAT!!!! If you want to propose to your other half go go go!!!!!! He/She will be blown away by the total experience. Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal.  I loved the shrimp and polenta better than my husband's steak,but it was still good.  I'm still thinking of the dessert!  The puff pastry was out of this world.   The Chef is awesome and the service was the best.  Definitely recommend it!  He had some soup and even gave us a serving.  Very sweet guy!"}
{"text":"Was at the Cafe Monarch last May and it was a wonderful experience so decided to go back since we were in town again. This time was not so good. When I had reserved I stated a preference for inside but when we got there I was asked if I wanted inside or out. That would lead me to believe they did not bother to read the booking preferences. The soup was overly salty as was the salad dressing. The main courses were fine but I had to remind the waiter to bring me a glass of wine I had ordered. Dessert was fine but not a knock-out. These might be overlooked in a less costly place, but at these prices one does expect a higher standard."}
{"text":"We were traveling to Scottsdale for the first time and discovered Cafe Monarch right here on Yelp! Based on other reviews we booked a reservation. It was absolutely fantastic. The dinners are a selection of entree from a four course meal. All four courses were amazing. From the steelhead pate, arugula salad, filet mignon, to the pastry dessert! First time I've cleaned my plate in years! :) We sat outside in the charming patio and had a fabulous time. The service and atmosphere were so nice! It is on the pricey side but well worth every penny spent. Highly recommend this excellent restaurant. It will not disappoint! As a bonus we received a complimentary glass of wine for booking the reservation on Yelp!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  My husband and I have been coming here for over a year.  The building and courtyard are very tastefully decorated.  The vines and foliage make me feel like I am eating in a garden; I love it!    I also love the fact that it is a set three course meal with a choice of two entrees for dinner. Believe it or not, it is hard to chose between the two because they both sound so delicious! Indeed the food is delicious and consistently great.   Christopher makes dinner look easy as a one man show in the kitchen.  It is truly amazing!  Looking forward to our next dinner...better plan soon!  Whoever the person is below that gave two stars and was surprised by a corkage fee needs to get out of the house more often.  A corkage fee is standard for any byob."}
{"text":"Last night I hosted a party of 28 at Cafe Monarch for my husband's 50th Birthday.  Christopher (and his wonderful assistant David!) handled everything beautifully.  Our guest were blown away by the venue, food, and comfortable atmosphere ... not an easy thing to pull off with this crowd.  Calamari and shrimp ceviche, prosciutto with cantaloupe salad, pork loin ratatouille, and a dessert of fresh strawberries with sweet whipped cream over puff pastry drizzled with chocolate... it was perfect!  We brought cases of wine and champagne and we had a beautiful, fun wine bar. For an evening in mid May, the weather completely cooperated and we were able to dine on the front porch.  We had a wonderful time... as I was able to completely leave all the details to Chris with the complete confidence that it would be wonderful.  I was not disappointed.  We had a relaxed evening celebrating with friends and family. Thank you again, Christopher."}
{"text":"The best way to describe this restaurant is a one man show, more like an artist in the kitchen with a friendly vibe and cozy interior. He literally was the host, server and chef. We enjoyed our visit and will definitely put it on our list of places to go to on our next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me for my birthday by introducing me to Café Monarch.  This was the most incredible dining experience that I have ever encountered.  Chef Chris is an artist, magician and conductor of an orchestra of one.  It really is something you must experience   The ingredients are simple but he turns them into a work of art.  The excitement of what will come to the table next makes the evening fun. The food was beautiful and outstanding!   It really is something you must experience for yourself.  We can't quit telling people about our experience.  R & L"}
{"text":"Was perfect for a valentine's dinner. Food delicately prepared with full of flavor, romantic ambience, and not overly priced. Will be back on our next trips to the town"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went here for our anniversary. We both had the fillet mignon and it was so wonderful and tender. The appetizer and dessert were great as well. We sat on the patio and even though it was close to hundred degrees outside the patio was about 20° cooler with the misters that they had going.   We didn't love the salad and I think it would've been great to have an option for two different kind of salads as well as the two options for the dinner entrée. Other than that though everything else was perfect. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"What?  A \"good place for children\", are you insane?  OK, not a good place for a children's birthday party, but a great place for your child who only wants to eat hot dogs.  My 7 yr old grandson became interested in cooking after watching Master Chef Junior.  The staff welcomed him and explained the ingredients in the dish, we tried to identify the different flavors and he was completely awestruck, declaring it a five star restaurant-- which we all agree with.  Chef Brandon came out and introduced himself, Scott's service was perfect -- attentive and helpful, and the food was simply fabulous. Carol S."}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant in Scottsdale. From cocktails, food, service and ambiance, this place meets all your expectations for a wonderful dining experience.   We started w the roasted cauliflower soup w truffle oil. Once we had that dish, we knew it cafe Monarch was the real deal.   Prawn tempura was light and crisp!   I had the sea bass (so buttery and flaky) seared perfectly. My husband had the filet which was cooked to perfection.   Great experience and extremely romantic if you get outdoor seating. Definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"Loved the place!  Food was really good.  Sea Bass and Filet Minon were delicious.  Presentation was outstanding.  Will definitely come back next time we're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is probably the best kept secret in Scottsdale.  The food is fresh and amazing.  The service is great and personable.  Sitting on the patio is a must especially in the fall.  A little pricy, but worth every cent.  After our dinner, we found out that our server was one of the owners.  He gave us a tour of the kitchen and introduced us to the chef.  Very cool experience and I wouldn't hesitate to dine here again."}
{"text":"This place is unreal.... best brunch I have had in quite some time.  The food, atmosphere and the owner make this place.  I went there on a business trip with my wife and baby.   I travel quite frequently and this is the best brunch place by far that I have encountered.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The chef whipped up a very tasty creation right on the spot. We had no idea what he was going to cook for us. And his dish did not disappoint. Every bite was an explosion of flavors.   Will be highly recommending this place to all of our friends in AZ.  Oh and bring cash."}
{"text":"An experience unlike any other.  My girlfriend took me here for my birthday.  It is cash only, BYOB, small tables, and romantic.  You get 3 courses prepared basically right next to you by the chef.  There really is no menu to choose from which I thought was cool, just what the chef gets from the market that day and decides to create.  We had a beef dish which was fantastic and we got lucky sitting next to him.  He had some extra shrimp left over from another dish he made and let us try it, it was amazing too.  Just a very cool/different dining experience.  Don't expect a quick, rushed dinner.  Just sit back, drink some if the wine you brought, and enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday dinner and was really looking forward to it. It was our first time and were so impressed on how beautiful the place is. We were sat at 6:45 and ordered drinks which came out pretty quickly. We ordered our entree's soon after.Our first 3 courses came out prompt and the cauliflower soup was spectacular. This is the main reason I am giving 3 stars. After we finished our first 3 courses it was about 7:15. There were 2 tables around us getting their courses at about the same time. Both tables got their entrees about 15-20 minutes later. We were still waiting. The other 2 tables got their dessert and coffee. We were still waiting. Both tables paid and left and we were still waiting. Finally our waiter came over and told they had a christmas party and the kitchen was backed up which we found questionable since we ordered at the same time as the other 2 tables who had already been gone 15 minutes. We finally get our food around 8:15. The broccolini was cold. The scallops were room temperature. The chicken was luke warm. Really disappointing. Our drinks and scallops were comped but it didn't really make up for not warm food and mediocre service on my birthday. If everything had been great we would have come back again. Now we won't."}
{"text":"This restaurant was awesome!  My husband David and I chose this restaurant for brunch based on the feedback/ratings in Yelp and, we weren't disappointed!!  The Chef had two items (Sweet & Savory) of which to choose from.  We chose the potato, spinach & mushroom frittata with chili rubbed pork tenderloin and it was wonderful!  We asked the Chef about the sauce and  He told us how he makes it and offered to send some home with us.  Unfortunately, we  are traveling so couldn't  even take our left overs.  We will definitely go back especially knowing that you can call in a reservation and speak with the Chef about any food allergies, etc. and he will accommodate!!  We also like that you can BYOB!!  Again, awesome restaurant, Chef and service!!!"}
{"text":"We booked a 6:30 reservation and were enchanted to sit on the patio during daylight, twilight, and moonlight.  But enough about the perfect garden patio.  The service was stellar, our glasses were kept full and plates removed promptly by the pleasant, polite staff.  The food was perfectly executed.  My husband ordered the side of scallops and we both had the halibut entree.  I detest creme brûlée but had to taste it - more liquified and much better than any I've tried against my will.  They used quality ingredients and everything tasted divine.  I highly recommend a visit to this hidden gem."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I have been in the Old Town Scottsdale area all weekend, having various subpar food experiences, until we showed up at Cafe Monarch!  This place is amazing!!! From the adorable outdoor courtyard dining area, to the extremely attentive wait staff, CM really set the tone to provide a truly amazing doing experience. We were hopeful the food and wine would also be incredible. And it was!! The chef changes the menu each week, but I cannot believe there would ever be a bad meal at this place. We each did the wine pairing with our meals - so much fun and so great to try wines we normally wouldn't have ordered without the pairing. We tried three of the four entree options and all of them were phenomenal!  This was by far the most expensive dining experience we had while in Scottsdale, but totally worth it! We had spent enough on other meals that ended up being fairly terrible that I think we would have paid anything to eat fabulous food like this! If you have a special occasion to celebrate or just enjoy a true five stars dining experience, you should definitely check this place out when in Old Town!"}
{"text":"A 4 course meal where each dish exceeded the prior. A superb meal with excellent service!"}
{"text":"We had our first experience at Cafe Monarch on Valentine's Day night...it was fabulous! The food was absolutely top notch, the service was fantastic and the atmosphere is unlike any other in the area.  We sat outside and enjoyed the amazing food while being warmed by heaters, listening to a crackling fire and the relaxing sound of water fountains.  Christopher is as friendly, talented and witty as they come - thanks Christopher for making our first Valentine's dinner together romantic and one to remember! We'll certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth 5 stars. Everything about my visit to Cafe Monarch was exceptional.   First, we were immediately intrigued by the brightly colored wall paint that had the two brunch choices for the day. Sweet & Savory. Both options sounded great, but I went for the Savory - which was a grilled salmon with tomato sauce & a baked spinach & potato quiche. The salmon was perfect - the best I have ever had. Many times salmon can get pretty dry, but it was tender and juicy. The quiche complimented the salmon nicely. It had a hint of spice (something - I could not distinguish) I thought both the presentation and taste was quite amazing.  My girlfriend got the sweet option. Naturally, I am not into the fruit tarts, but I think chef Chris had a nice balance between fruits and vegetables. The plate came with a giant hunk of brie. I would say that even though it wasn't for me, it was still delightful.  I am a sucker for D.I.Y decor. This place is filled with nick nacks that just make you smile. You can feel the passion that Chris has for culinary and interior design. You must go to the bathroom while at Cafe Monarch! Its super cool.   After brunch we talked to Chris about his work, and he was very informative and humble. Upon leaving, we felt nothing but good feelings about supporting Chris and Cafe Monarch. It was a truly unique experience that set the precedent for me. Well done Chris!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places where after taking the second bite you put down your fork and say: \"oh. My. God.\" I am not going to write an overly loquacious review. This restaurant is simply perfect and perfectly simple. Both in the kitchen and out, the entire staff are passionate about their work. We were here on our honeymoon and it couldn't have possibly been better. Lamb shank all the way!"}
{"text":"The service here is positively seamless. The food is always fresh and well-cooked and delicious. Wine pairings with the set menu are pricy but usually worth it. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"When I heard about the restaurant while getting my haircut, it sounded very intriguing and interesting.  When I heard that the chef/owner was a one man show, I truly wondered how the service would be.  I pictured an \"I love Lucy episode.\"  Well, I went last night and my world was rocked, so much in fact that selfishly I didn't want to tell more people.  I know, I know it's not about me, so here I am writing, It ROCKED! The ambiance, the service, the artistry of the plate, the quality of the taste of the food was ALL AMAZING!  Icing on the cake, the \"one man show, chef/owner, Christopher was also very warm, funny, quick witted and on TOP of it all.  I'll be back!\" Marc G."}
{"text":"Food and drink was really good...we would totally go back, but it seemed a bit rushed.  All and all a great experience!"}
{"text":"We have been here for dinner and brunch once and for lunch multiple times. Each meal was fabulous! Our favorites are brunch and lunch - such wonderful flavors and fresh food! We always make sure to order different items, so we can try everything!  Christopher is very kind and attentive, and it is obvious that he really takes pride in this place. We love how beautiful the restaurant is, both inside and on the patio.  This is definitely one of the places we go to when we have out-of-towners here. We will continue to come here many times over!"}
{"text":"One of our best meals in months. Impeccable service along with a great outdoor setting was the perfect stage for an incredible meal. Cauliflower purée, beat gnocchi and a to-die-for vegetarian polenta and vegetable medley entree (also available with protein) made for a terrific dinner experience."}
{"text":"This is the ultimate hidden gem for a romantic, cozy dinner. The back patio is intimate and candlelit, making it feel more like an evening out in SoCal than AZ. The full course menu is unique and the food is delicious. Dining at Cafe Monach is an absolute joy from start to finish."}
{"text":"At first I was bummed when I found out it was a fixed price restaurant as I was on a tight time line. But they were awesome and let me order a la carte. The food is amazing. And the service was totally with a smile. Ample free parking too."}
{"text":"This was definitely a very cool and intimate setting, where the owner is the cook, host, and waiter.  The food was fantastic, and the atmosphere is very relaxing."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a wonderful gem in the heart of Downtown So Sco!! Chef Chris is absolutely fantastic and I can't wait to go back!!!  Don't forget your own wine ($10 corkage/bottle), cash and your big appetite!! Love it!!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about Cafe Monarch! First, the atmosphere is very unique to anything I have experienced in the United States. Cafe Monarch brings me straight back to the best summer of my life, jaunting around Europe. Dining both inside and outside are rich sensory experiences--the hanging garden and generally the vast lushness of the outside seating feels like a private corner of paradise. Inside I love the artwork, the scents, the music... everything feels intimate and special.   The service, I think, is unparalleled in terms of restaurants in the area. I generally am a big fan of the FRC restaurants, but they don't even hold a candle to Cafe Monarch. I can't tell you how many waiters I saw doubling as photographers, without a hint of mockery (more common than one might think.) Other than food, what I like about Cafe Monarch is the way they treat me. I feel good, I feel respected, even a little bit special. I wish that feeling came standard with every upscale dining experience, but I often leave nice restaurants feeling self conscious and inferior. Not here.   Ok the food. I love the rotating menu. Everything tastes fresh, flavorful, and creative. You can never go wrong with a soup or a steak. On my birthday I ordered an appetizer but was jealous of my best friend's soup. I found myself stealing spoonfuls until the waiter came over with my very own soup \"a birthday present.\"   If you have a special occasion, or just want to feel special, come here. You won't regret it.  UPDATE: I am removing one star because of everything Cafe Monarch has removed from their once very reasonably priced prix fixe menu. I think they raised the price, too, which is more understandable."}
{"text":"Amazing place. If you want to impress your honey, this is the place. The food is great, I highly recommend this restaurant. Chris, Charlotte NC"}
{"text":"Outstanding dinner. Believe the five star rating. Creative pairings of food without being precious or silly. Fresh, fresh, fresh food. Excellent flavors from herbs, and you've never seen such fresh herbs on a plate. Professional and friendly owner. Could have huge attitude, given the demand for reservations, but doesn't. Uncorked our sparkling wine, kept it chilled, poured refills until it was all gone (we had a cab).  The restaurant is small, but not cramped, and I think some reviews make it sound like this is some sort of hole in the wall with an eccentric dining room. It is not. The decor is tasteful and warm   The kitchen is part of the room, but you can be as aware of it as you choose. Christopher had PHilip helping as a waiter, and he did a great job. The first course was super fresh and delicious salad with mint, cucumber, tomato, and other things, with a large, thin piece of flatbread, itself fantastic. We shared entrees. My poached salmon with orzo/mint?/other ingredients, and her grilled Rosemary chicken over cheesy polenta. All of it was incredible. Dessert was pastry, strawberries, whipped cream, chocolate ice cream or ganache?  Another home run. We will be back."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is so beautiful. Service is great. Nice succinct wine list. The restaurant is spotless, the bathroom is so cool. It would be a great place to get engaged or have an anniversary.  Johnny was an excellent waiter and we all really enjoyed ourselves as will you! I agree the patio is beautiful and warm even in winter although I would not have minded eating inside as it was beautiful too!"}
{"text":"The negative and subpar reviews completely dumbfound me.  This is a dining experience unlike no other.  If you're looking for a restaurant where everything is mass produced and the staff hurries you through to turnover table after table, then this won't be enjoyable for you.   If however, you enjoy unique dining experiences and spending time talking with your dining companions then this is the place for you.  Yes, it's BYOB and cash only.  The fact that it's cash only, who cares.  Really?  Why people find an issue in that is ridiculous.  You know in advance so why can't you plan for it?  And me personally, I love the fact that I can bring a really great bottle of wine versus ordering the same bottle at a restaurant marked up 200+%.  A $10 corkage fee is very minimal.  Now let me get to the food.  $45 for a pre-fixed 3 course meal is PEANUTS for the amount and quality of food you receive.  Chef Chris takes great pride in his unique creations and I love showing up and being surprised.  While his creatiions are unique, they are not crazy adventurous where most people couldn't be satisfied at the entree selections.  He does create highly complex dishes with interesting flavor profiles that will leave you guessing how he imagined such unique combinations.  And yes, as some previous posts noted, there is a time delay in receiving your courses.  Again, this is an experience, not a meal at the Olive Garden. Chef Chris preps and creates every bit of your meal as a one-man show with fresh ingredients that change daily with the season.  Why rush it, enjoy it, it's worth it!  And really, some are upset if he doesn't make it to their table?  He's cooking all the food for everyone by himself.  On nights where he can pop out and mingle with his guests, he does.  Other nights it may not be as feasible.  Give him a break.  Ignore the negative posts and go give Chris a chance for yourself.  It's these small restaurants with amazing food that I choose to give my money to and support.  You should too.  If you have the right attitude and love great food, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Dinner in the garden at Cafe Monarch is worth flying in from anywhere! Perfect ambiance, perfect food and perfect service! Bravo!!"}
{"text":"Had a fabulously romantic dinner here with my husband. My first taste of scallops and was really apprehensive. They tasted as smooth as butter and perfectly cooked. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places we have ever dined. We enjoyed our anniversary here in 2009 and had the pleasure to meet the owner. We need to return soon as this is one of the best places in Arizona for dinning."}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch is everything and more that fans say it is.  It is \"more\" when you experience it for yourself.   Lately, I've been going to some really nice restaurants in town and I cannot find anything that can top Chef Christopher's food.   Everything here is made right in front of you and it's so fresh.  Chef Christopher rarely serves the same thing twice. He's so innovative and comes up with the best flavor profiles. Loved the ribs - they were so rich and fell off the bone.  The sauce and the polenta were amazing.  Every dessert I've had there has been amazing too.  Usually something involving a fruit but also chocolate, which seems to be a must when you go there.   Talk to Chef Christopher.  He is a very  humble chef .  His talents are top-notch and really haven't been met by any other valley restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"love this place. Romantic atmosphere, nice music, good food. perfect for a nice date!"}
{"text":"Just an incredible place. Former owner Chef Christopher is in my opinion the best chef in town, so when he sold or closed Cafe Monarch, I thought that was the end of one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. But alas, never have I been disappointed at monarch still. New ownership picked up right where it left off and have even made some pleasant additions. I have had intimate dinners with a date, as well as large group dinners and every time I leave more than pleased by every facet of the meal. Family style dinner with a group of about 15 others was probably my favorite experience ever here. Menu changes frequently, but everything I have ever had is either very good or exceptional. Can't say enough good things.  Food: incredible Ambiance: very homey. Romantic, comfortable, a+ Drinks: addition of full bar is nice, good cocktails. Didn't mind the old days when it was only BYOB either though.  Service: spot on.   One of the top restaurants in the entire valley, and southwest for that matter."}
{"text":"I went there with a frnd today afternoon for a brunch !! Its a lovely place and one of the best that i have been to in Phoenix ! Luved it..Go here when you have plenty of time to realx as you wud want to spend a lot of time wen u see the place.  Few things about this place -  1. Its a one man show - Christopher runs this place and handles 'everything' by himself.He is very cordial and welcoming  2. Its BYOB.I noticed Chris helping guests with their bottles i.e opening it for the,serving it as well..I didnt expect that so i appreciate him for that 3. You will have only 2 options--Sweet ( Baked Lemon ) or Savory ( Egg Stratta that has mushroom,goat cheese,aspargus tomato )..Each plate $20 flat.Also includes a drink of your choice..I had a really nice 'Aqua Fresca'..Its like a fruit punch.He also had green tea , coffee, hibiscus tea.Bdw these 2 options are different every day :-) 4. Cash only  I luved the decor of the place..very neat & clean  , limited seating indoor ( around 5 two seater tables and 1 four seater ) . Also has outdoor seating.  I will surely go back there soon !!"}
{"text":"Last night we had an incredible dinner at Cafe Monarch.  The service was very attentive.  The food tasted amazing!  Everyone at our table loved their meal and wine.  You definitely pay for what you get.  It is a little pricey, but worth it.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star was because each time  they delivered our food or wine it was set in front of the wrong person.  Taking a sip of Riesling when you ordered Chardonnay was unexpected. It was not a big deal and didn't ruin our experience, but when you spend a lot of money this shouldn't repeatedly happen.  We will definitely return in the future because the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I headed out to Café Monarch for a friend's birthday last Sunday. The place is tiny and positively filled with atmosphere. There are only a handful of tables inside, and Chef Chris is able to give personal attention to each one. We were a little earlier than most of the rest of the folks, so we had the chance to sit and chat with him before he started cooking. Seriously? I'd go back just to hang out with the guy.   He prepared an absolutely fabulous meal. We started with a salad -- lots of greens, citrus, raisins, some tabbouleh and a little eggplant. Magnificent. The main course was ribs. I'll be honest.. I'm not really a ribs person.... but these were like, fall off the bone, melt in your mouth delicious ribs. Dessert included some of the richest chocolate that I've had in quite some time.   It's BYOB & cash only. And amazing."}
{"text":"We have dined all over the world. The food, service, attention to detail and ambiance are world class. By far THE best restaurant in Arizona!!"}
{"text":"This is an addendum to a recent review I wrote after a disappointing dinner at Cafe Monarch two weeks ago.  I must report that Chef Christopher has been both gracious and responsive to my concerns.  I will admit that we did not complain to them directly the night of our dinner.  I believe he would have remedied the situation on the spot if we had.  I learned something from this experience and feel  that with this particular chef it would be  welcomed to comment at the time.  Chef Chris is to be congratulated for this, as I have found at other restaurants  commenting on the food was  meet with open hostility.  Chef Christopher kindly offered me a \"refund\" which was not the intent of my review, but it is greatly appreciated in the spirit of exceptional customer service, for which he is known.  He communicated with me directly by email and was very generous in his solution to the situation. Thank you Chris for being so responsive with no hint of anger and the integrity to stand by your belief in your restaurant.  We will come to Cafe Monarch again next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"What an amazing place!! Four courses, with great wine pairings.  Great wine list, with some amazing boutique Napa wines, as well as great old world selections.  One of the best dining experiences I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.  I've been going for years and the food, service, and decor is consistently top notch.  Go. When you do, ask your server for suggestions. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I brought my mother to Cafe Monarch for her birthday on November 7th. We had just relocated to Phoenix a few days before and I really wanted to make her birthday special since she would be away from family and friends. After arriving a Cafe Monarch, I knew this would be a special experience. Christopher, the chef/owner, greeted us warmly right away. Monica seated us and we sat outside on a perfect Sunday morning enjoying the beautiful atmosphere of the restaurant. The concept was very simple: one sweet entree and one savory entree and your choice of beverages for one flat price that included taxes as well.  The beverages were refreshing, watermelon and orange aqua fresca and a fruity delicious herbal iced tea offering along with full-bodied coffee. Of course we ordered both a savory and a sweet entree. I was not prepared for how wonderful the food would be. It was simply divine. The quality of the ingredients was truly exceptional. I have never had prosciutto so thinly sliced and delicate in flavor. Not only did we eat some of the most wonderful food, we had the opportunity to share a wonderful conversation with Christopher. He was so warm and friendly and he went above and beyond to make my mother's birthday memorable.  I cannot wait to return for dinner because I know it will be yet another unforgettable experience."}
{"text":"I expected more based on the reviews I read. First thing I noticed was scented candles.  The waiter barely gave us time to enjoy a drink and conversation, he was all business. I would have expected from a restaurant this size to be a bit more personal. Food was nicely presented, but, just fair. My entree was too salty, as was my husbands."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to write this review for a few weeks now but life keeps happening. That and the fact that I realized any way that I try to describe my two experiences at Cafe Monarch will come off as hyperbolic because it's just that damn good.  Chris is amazing and I'm honored to say that I have eaten his food. His coffee has chicory in it for the love of God. He understands balance of flavors, freshness and service. Above all else, service.   My first trip, I was solo and after chatting with me a bit, as I was leaving, he asked me to bring the kids next time.  So I did. I came on Sunday for brunch and brought my husband and my 8 (nearly 9) year old son and Chris spoiled him rotten.   For the person who checked that it was not for kids: Maybe not for entitled, bratty kids who do not know how to sit and entertain themselves for longer than an hour. But for polite, well behaved ones who understand and recognize what good food is? It's perfectly fine.   Again, I was encouraged to bring mine and Chris did not disappoint, they were like two peas in a pod. Chris was even impressed that my son already knew what kind of cheese he had scrambled into his eggs.   A lovely experience at a charming place with amazing food cooked by a talented man.  See? Hyperbolic...but true."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance, excellent service, great four course wine with food tasting menu and above all, the food was amazing...great presentation and fusion of flavors.  The only negative was the lack of lower or mid-price point wines.  On the other hand if you are a connoisseur of fine wines, you will love it."}
{"text":"I wanted to let my mind settle before I wrote this review. I had dinner with Chef Chris on October 21st for my fiance's Birthday and it was for sure the best dinner we have ever had. Bring your best bottle of wine and cash and get ready for a truly unique dining experience. There are not enough words to describe how good the food and experience is. I would recommend sitting outside if weather allows. I live in las vegas and even with all the dining options here will be making a flight to scottsdale just to eat some of the chefs creations I can't wait to eat there again. thanks so much Chef Chris"}
{"text":"I am going to assume that if you are searching for the top rated dining spot in Scottsdale, that you abhor chain restaurants and appreciate top shelf, niche estabishments whose reason for living is to create something wonderful with each meal.    Cafe Monarch is the best small-scale niche restaurant in the Phoenix area.  Period.  The quality of food is paralleled only by the care the owner/chef takes to create an amazing experience.  If you require white glove service, Lambos in the parking lot and a dram of Johnny Walker Blue that's marked up 2000%, do not come here.    This is a place for foodies.  Enjoy.  TjD"}
{"text":"I had a chance to have dinner here in the back patio and it was great. They have their water sprinklers on so if you don't want those spraying over your food, try to find a table out of their direction.   As for the food I had no complaints. The service was fantastic as well.  Overall a great dining experience."}
{"text":"My wife and i just dined at this restaurant. I am a chef and must say that Chef Chris's concept is one I have not experienced.The food was outstanding, service excellent and the decore was creative,down to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on.  Our entrees were served on either a bed of sundried ploenta or baby spincach and blackrice.  What really intrigued me was the slaw made of shredded green papaya that was part of the appetizer course. Being a chef I had to share a neat appetizer, that i recently found, using a baby corn shoot!  Chef keep up the suberb Cafe Monarch Bravo."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me with dinner at Café Monarch last night. What a surprise! Chef/Owner Chris takes you on a unique and innovative culinary journey. The atmosphere and world he has created is whimsical and romantic.  Smart concept - prix fixe menu and BYOB. This allows you to enjoy his inventive cuisine and a special bottle of wine in a gorgeous and intimate environment. I highly recommend this restaurant. I eagerly look forward to my next dining experience at Café Monarch."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here a few weeks ago with friends. We dined on Heirloom Tomato-Watermelon Gazpacho, Spring Thyme Roasted \"Outer Banks\" Wild Striped Bass, and an amazing Key Lime-White Chocolate Tart.   The service was impeccable and the wine selection was fabulous. Sitting on the patio in the far corner was intimate and comfortable. The atmosphere in this restaurant is great for a romantic evening, dinner with friends or even meeting the parents for the first time (at the table next to us). If you have the ability to go, spend the $55/per person and get the wine parings too! It's worth it!"}
{"text":"I had the best Mother's Day brunch ever at Cafe Monarch. I also had dinner here once and my taste buds could not have been happier. An exquisite cornucopia of ingredients that were obviously well thought of by the chef resulting into delectable dishes that I ended up craving for. Indeed, a very talented, one of a kind chef in a place with such a romantic and enchanting ambiance. A one of a kind experience. It was worth very penny."}
{"text":"Amazing! Such a great romantic and culinary experience. It's expensive but so worth it."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best fine dinning experience in Arizona. Wesam was our server (he is also the Sommelier). His service was incredible, only to be outdone by the amazing food.   There were slightly less expensive options but the 4-course Prix Fixe menu we chose was $80 per person. While it's more expensive than our usual \"date night\", we can't wait for another chance to come back."}
{"text":"Hands down best restaurant I've ever been to in AZ. My wife and I celebrate our Anniversary here every single year."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight for our Anniversary and I think it's my new favorite restaurant.  The atmosphere is one of the nicest we've seen in Phoenix - not the typical Scottsdale restaurant. We had a table in the courtyard and it was beautiful and intimate. The place is upscale but not pretentious.  Loved the food!  They have a 4 course meal and you have the option of a wine pairing, which we did.    This restaurant is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great service! Amazing atmosphere! Phenomenal food! Incredible staff! 5 stars all around!!"}
{"text":"The raves for Cafe Monarch are supremely justified.  Had Chef Chris all to ourselves last night and man, did he pull off a five star dining experience!   We started with an icy timbale of roasted salmon and orzo, redolent with fresh dill, capers, and sharp peppercorns, served alongside a quartered tomato at the peak of tender ripeness-- with a plump caperberry nestled inside--pickled whimsy.  Main course came with two choices. Option1: A slow roasted pork loin, rolled in a spicy mixture accented with the warm aroma of toasted cumin. The pork was complemented by a cooling salsa of green Thompson grapes and rounded out with sauteed black quinoa, done pilaf style.  Option 2: A perfectly rendered crisp, juicy veal chop, enriched by an ethereal cream sauce of ancho chile and cilantro. Also starring: roasted local corn and sauteed spinach, providing a snap of green flavor/color to this already gorgeous dish.  Dessert: Golden peaches quartered and baked in a crusted veil of lemon scented streusel and finished with a healthy dollop of silky whipped cream.  Perfection!  A dinner with Chris is a uniquely intimate affair, his warmth and culinary ingenuity will leave the toughest critic contented.  Cannot wait to gift my nearest and dearest with another evening at Cafe Monarch."}
{"text":"Excellent service, wonderful food and a fantastic atmosphere! I will for sure visit Monarch again the next time I am in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Amazing anniversary dinner last night. Fabulous service and each food course was unique and delicious. The portion sizes are perfect so you leave feeling satisfied but not over stuffed. A surprise was a cute anniversary gift and desert with a sparkling candle !  The interior is reminiscent of what an old European cafe might feel like. REAL burning candles and a small live flower bud display on the tables definitely a nice touch.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great experience at Monarch last night. Place was all class. Great setting, impeccable service and top notch food (all 4 courses) & cocktails. Outside area was extra touch, misters kept us cool. Thank you for an incredible night."}
{"text":"one of the best dining experiences we have ever had. the cauliflower soup was exceptional, the rest of the meal was outstanding. keep the misters on continuously when it is still hot outside... only reason the evening was not perfect, it got too hot on the lovely patio."}
{"text":"This is a great spot. The patio is beautiful and romantic with lots of candles. The service was great and the food was top notch. The menu changes daily and although there aren't a ton of options, everything we had was excellent. Creative and well prepared. The steak was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. My husband added the fois gras and it was some of the best he's had. We added the wine pairing and the wines were from small producers and were good choices for the food. The pours were generous. We will definitely come back here next time we visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale on vacation and needed to fund lunch in a pinch. I used my Yelp app and came across Cafe Monarch. The rave reviews were spot on. I could not have been more impressed. This is not the type of place that you expect to find among the chain restaurants in Scottsdale. It is a hidden gem! The owner is the chef, the waiter and the bus boy. He was very friendly and accommodating to a food allergy at our table. The food was outstanding!"}
{"text":"After reading several on-line reviews of Cafe Monarch promoting its concept of a personal chef for a night, and fantastic food preparations it became a \"Must try!\" for me. I went with a group of 4 people total (two from out of town) to enjoy chef Chris' creation. We made reservations several weeks prior for a Sunday night. We were hoping for Saturday night, but it was rented out for a private party, which is quite common for this place.   We show up and get seated at our table inside in a little bit of an alcove so we were away from the rest of the tables, and certainly enjoyed the privacy afforded by such placement. Chris comes right over and welcomes us, double checks for food allergies or special preparations (he asked when we made the reservation as well), and opens our bottles of wine (BYOB in case you did not know). He tells us to relax and enjoy ourselves while he prepares the first course of hummus and arugula salad with capers and corn chips. The portions are very large and most of the table did not finish the dish completely, saving room for the main course.   The main course comes out and we have our choice of pork medallions in a citrus pepper glaze or a salmon fillet with a tarragon cream sauce. We get two of each in order to try as much as possible. Neither dish disappointed. The pork was cooked perfectly and tasted like it was dry rubbed with a red pepper mixture and then grilled and topped with a sauce that resembled confetti. As best as we could tell it had a mango and pineapple base with basil, chilies, and a variety of other seasonings. The pork was good enough to stand on its own, but the glaze made it exponentially better.   The salmon was pan fried and topped with a simple cream, sherry, and tarragon mixture. Once again, the protein is more than capable of standing on its own, however the sauce takes it to the next level.   Dessert was a poached pear dish in a burgundy reduction with a chocolate drizzle and a puff pastry, which was mentioned in previous reviews. It was very light, and a perfect ending to our meal.   Overall the meal took about two and a half hours, but we were in no rush and really enjoyed ourselves. Chris was an amazingly gracious host and making people happy seems to come to him NATurally. It was a wonderful experience and we plan on making up reasons to justify going back to see what else this one man band can serenade us with again and again."}
{"text":"Words can't even describe this place. From the patio atmosphere, and the exquisite tasting food, to the kind and knowledgeable waiters. Quality ingredients superbly cooked. An unforgettable experience."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely amazing Valentine's dinner. Food was impeccable, ambiance was great. So nice to actually be able to sit, relax and enjoy a wonderful meal. At the end of the evening the chef came out a chatted with us for a little bit. A definite must!"}
{"text":"A little paradise tucked away around old town Scottsdale. If you've always wanted to have chef to cook for you this is the place! If you're a picky eater I suggest you call ahead of time to check up on what is being served here. The menu varies day by day and is usually up to the chef to decide. If you're having dinner here I recommend bringing a nice bottle of wine to enjoy with your dinner. Talk to the chef and you'll have a lovely dinner!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Restuarant Gary Dankos (SF), Per Se (NY), and Inn At Little Washington ( near DC) and this place is right there with them food wise. Could use a little polish with the staff.  A lot of them are young and just need the PROPER training.  Otherwise I would have given 5+ stars. Overall a place not to miss.  I would recommend warming the soup bowls as our soup cooled off quickly. Everything was prepared to perfection.  Cocktails were excellent. Great wine list. Even the car attendant was a pleasure. A must go!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My girlfriend and I made our 3rd visit on NYE and couldn't have been happier with our experience. They get 5 stars from us when it comes to food, service, and ambiance. Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"My goodness! Where are these reviews coming from?? A PR company? I've seen such positive press on this restaurant that when my husband tried to make a reservation and they told him that we needed to wait 3 weeks and  bring two friends since they only had a four top I was still excited to go. Disappointed. One, you pay a cork fee for your wine but the waiters are nowhere to be found to pour it. Not ONCE. Two, the decor was sterile at best. It was like modern looking office depot desks placed in a warehouse in some parts and then fake pine needles and mirrors in another. Kind of 'off'. Maybe they need to consult a decorator. Three, although we were told to bring two people since there were no two tops, there were 2 of them just in our little room alone not even including the front area. FOOD: You had no choice of appetizers or desert. One choice.  For the entree you got to choose between fish and meat but when we ordered the meat they didn't even ask how we liked it cooked. It was all average. AND, the reviews all tout how involved the owner is in choosing the meals but we saw no hide or hair of him until we were in the parking lot ready to leave.  Small asides: I asked for black napkins. They had them but they were wet. Yup. Wet. And when we decided to take a doggy bag (yes, for the dog) they handed us a cardboard box and told us to have at it.   DISAPPOINTED. We will never ever ever ever ever go back again. The food was OK but nothing to brag about. Considering they only have FOUR dishes in the whole restaurant I expected to be wowed. Not so.  Don't waste an evening out or your hard earned cash on this place. And I mean cash literally. They don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for our Anniversary this year. I was so excited to try this place. The food was fantastic, the ambiance is truly romantic and old world  beautiful. We sat outside, the twinkle lights are abundant and everything about the decor screams quaint European  which always appeals to me. I would have been happy to give 5 stars but unfortunately I was disappointed with our server (sorry I have forgotten his name). He was friendly and knowledgeable but slow on our orders and when we arrived it was not very busy. I noticed that every table had a flower in the middle except ours and our candle was not lit. So I asked if he might light our candle and possibly bring me a flower. He did light the candle but never brought me a flower. He also did not check on us throughout the night after he brought our meal. So, while I loved the food and ambiance, the service that we received was less than impressive."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended Cafe Monarch after attending a Sunday Brunch. We went for dinner with a group of 6, and we had a great time! The food was fantastic, the service was great, and it is truly a unique dining experience. I've never seen or heard of anything else like it. The restaurant is charming, and Christopher is very sweet and hugely talented. I cannot gush enough about this place, so I'll keep it simple: YOU MUST GO HERE!  Details: For dinner, Chris offered one starter (an amazing summer salad), two entrees (pork and salmon) and two desserts (orange cheesecake that I will never forget and a pastry with chocolate gelatto). The price was $45, pre fixe, and the cost for corking wine was $10 per bottle, and $1 per beer. CASH ONLY! Overall, the night was pricey ($120 for two people), but definitely worth it for a special night out with friends, or an important occasion."}
{"text":"Went for our 1 year anniversary and was absolutely blown away with this little gem. We were welcomed by the staff and completely taken aback with their effortless ambiance. They romance you with candles lit and twinkling lights above and around you. We were served by Scott who has now become one of my favorite servers. The food was played beautifully and no words could simply describe the extent of how delicious it was. I will now call cafe monarch my secret little garden where magic just happens to exist."}
{"text":"Regurgitated attempt at the refined. Apparently relies on the ambiance of the courtyard but beware as the hostesses are especially inept. As well as waiter who added an additional $75 in drinks to our tab. Led us to believe it was 45 minute wait for outside (after calling to ensure it was a very special occasion on the reservation)then other couples initially seated inside complained enough to be moved outside after back and forth with the dim hostesses. Apparently that's the norm. Likely Purposeful since it is limited seating outside. Would have overlooked if food was worth it. Definitely over salted. Would never return - ruined a very special occasion."}
{"text":"Amazing! I came here upon a recommendation of a coworker.   I came during lunch for the weekend and was greeted by the owner/chef! The entire atmosphere of the restaurant was beautiful and I took lots of pictures. It is one of the nicest decorated restaurants I've ever been to before, including the high-class ones that charge $300 per meal.  (Sry if this sound snobby, but hopefully this provides good frames of reference)  I sat in the garden outdoors and got a grilled cheese and tomato soup ($10) and a chocolate brownie with walnuts and strawberries ($7). The grilled cheese sandwich was the BEST grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had, and I've had tons and tons of them during my life. The crust was perfect for dipping into the tomato soup and there was at least 2 types of cheese. The tomato soup was spicy and had lots of minced garlic. One lady at the table next to me thought it was too spicy, but to me it was fantastic and was a welcome departure from the typical tomato soup (you know, the creamy, bland, salty campbells soup kind). The brownie was unique as well, not only was it beautiful to look at, but the brownie was moist and tasted like..CINNAMON! Dude, I've had fine pastries. I am a regular whole foods fiend, and I go all the time to local bakeries in my native DC area. I've gone to the most expensive and exclusive stores in Tokyo (Ginza district) to get desserts, and I've also eaten in Paris before as well at various boulangeries . The brownie here was one of the most memorable deserts I've ever had. I've NEVER expected cinnamon in a chocolate brownie!   Services was very attentive as well. I am recommending that everyone who goes to Scottsdale to visit this place! Absolutely some of the most delicious AND unique (this is important!!) American-style food you will ever have. They are cash only though, so please keep that in mind."}
{"text":"BYOB, Cash Only. Beautiful setting. Incredibly romantic! Having the Chef personally call you ahead of time is so awesome! He asked for allergies and likes/dislikes. Dinner was great! Perfect place for throwing an intimate dinner party too!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for our five year anniversary dinner. Cafe Monarch is class. Sophisticated menu, romantic ambience at night, excellent service....need I say more? They have candles lit on the outside patio at night. The food and drinks were exceptional! Expect to pay more than average, but you are getting your money's worth."}
{"text":"Love it! Right up there with Fnand B as the best restaurant in Scottsdale. Fn and B has the better location.  Cafe Monarch is harder to find as it is 3 blocks from the restaurant area in downtown Scottsdale. We were there for breakfast 2 years ago it was $20 and you choose sweet or savory. The chef was the cook, and the waiter. While, they were busy, he could hire more staff if the average chains were not so busy. It is upsetting that more people do not give small great places like this a chance. While, I do not love yelp, yelp was the only way we would have found this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Loved every inch of this charming place.  Original and creative.  Not your cookie cutter restaurant that's for sure.  The owner put his heart and soul into this cafe and I hope people will give him a chance."}
{"text":"Love Love this place! The jewel of the valley offering very creative dishes from an extraordinary chef. An eye for a keen sense of taste and entertainment. Truly an artist in his mastery...finally someone who understands what simple pleasures can bring. Spontaneous happiness is this place! I highly recommend. My wedding rehearsal dinner will be a unique experience in his hands....can't wait for what Chef Chris has to bring:)"}
{"text":"Wonderful place with lots of atmosphere inside and out. Lovingly decorated and the food was delicious. You stop outside the door for the menu, I think it is what the Chef feels like making that day. I had a great tomato soup with grilled cheese bread  - and the Chef even asked me if I liked the burned ends of the bread, how did he know?????  - and for desert pumpkin bread with baked pear and what I believe was a cranberry puree  - it was fantastic. The food is made with great care right in front of you - so do bring some time to enjoy. An absolute do again. Come early and it is cash only."}
{"text":"Class, such class!!! The owner was so sweet and just attentive to me and my friends needs. I truly appreicated him paying close attention to my allergy. The food was exquisite and you can tell they love what they do. I am also in love with the butterflies that come up in the spring. Just a great setting overall..."}
{"text":"This is an absolutely wonderful find! I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone, I have only been there twice so far since I found it, we absolutely loved it both times, couldn't of asked for anything better. Ambience is excellent service was great, food was wonderful, can't wait to eat there more!"}
{"text":"Saturday brunch at  Cafe Monarch in Old Town Scottsdale is truly extraordinary!   As a \"foodie\" who has eaten at some of the finest restaurants in the world, I hardly expected to have one of the greatest meals of my life at a tiny, off-the-beaten-path cafe in Scottsdale.   Even more amazing than the fresh, bright, and innovative flavors, attention to detail and quality of the food - is the whole operation is a one man show.   Yet, Chef Christopher manages to pull off a meal equal to that of a five star restaurant...all while waiting tables, answering the phone, cooking and charming guests.      The menu is different every day and limited, so between four of us, we ordered one of everything on the menu.   I had the most moist, delicious pork chop with a sweet chili sauce, simple salad and French style omelet and shoestring fries.   We also ordered the goat cheese panini  sandwich (with grilled vegetables and dried cranberries) and savory salmon with tomatoes and cream.   Each dish was  fresh, simple and prepared to utter perfection.   The coffee was bold, rich, hot and delicious.   We sat inside and talked to Chef Chris while he prepared food (the kitchen is open and in the middle of the restaurant).    Be prepared for a unique, fresh, dinning experience that is truly unlike anything you will find anywhere else.  Of note, it is cash only and BYOB.   Will be eating again here soon (this weekend)!"}
{"text":"*UPDATE*: The management of Monarch called me and stated that they were sorry about my experience and they were going to try and make amends. It has been 4 months since our conversation & no follow up has happened. The customer service the Monarch is still providing 6 months later is still ONE STAR. I still recommend NOT to dine at Monarch. There are multiple high end dinning experiences within a 5 minutes that provide a much better dinning experience.  Original Review: This was not the place to have an anniversary dinner. I had made reservations 2 weeks in advance asking for the most romantic romantic table they had available. We were put in a main walkway next to where all the wait staff was talking about the customers. The food was good but not memorable. Your bill will be $300 minimum waking out the door and you have to have certain expectations. Cafe Monarch did not deliver tonight. Siting at Cafe Monarch tonight felt like another table at an expensive restaurant in Scottsdale instead of an dinning & memorable experience to remember for a life time. There are much better romantic alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"I do not understand the poor reviews here.  We loved the quaintness of Cafe Monarch, it added to the experience.  The waiter was the best kind of attentive, he came over to serve our dishes, five mins later to check on the food and then ten mins later to refill the wine glasses.  The place is cash only and BYOB, but we had done the research and were aware of this ahead of time.  I got the sea bass which was TO DIE FOR and my husband got the steak, which was also FANTASTICO!  Chef Christopher was amazing, he even showed me how me made a couple of the sides so I could duplicate at home.  I will definitely be sending my parents here for their anniversary and anyone else who wants a nice meal."}
{"text":"I feel I'm long overdue to write a review as it was Yelp that led me here.   My search words were \"romantic\" and \"candlelit\"...and for my dining companion's sake, I threw in \"vegan\".  This place delivered on all three counts. I only wish my date had measured up to the restaurant, but that's a different story...  They were able to accommodate us on very short notice, and were not fazed at all when I mentioned that one meal would need to be vegan. I knew it would be a little spendy, but I was ready for a reason to throw on the LBD and the boots, and to be fair, of course it costs more, it's not Olive Garden. (If you happen to love Olive Garden, don't take offense...apples and oranges...).  I had read previous reviews about the outdoor seating area, but unfortunately, (or maybe fortunately) it was raining that night and we had to eat inside. We mistakenly walked to the kitchen first, and I already loved it. We were *personally* greeted, and shown to our table. It has an intimate, warm feel, and there were only two other parties there.  I was in my little black dress, and others were a bit more casual yet no one seemed over or under dressed. The server wore jeans and a black dress shirt, and the whole place seemed \"casually elegant\" if that makes sense.  I ordered white wine, and my date ordered red. I am not a huge red wine drinker, I really wish I could remember what it was though-- (a Cab of some sort) because I came close to converting that night...:)  The food was amazing. The chef had prepared a vegan meal specifically for my date, and I had the lamb. Everything from the appetizers to the dessert was perfection. The portions were not huge, but the flavors more than made up for that, as it should be...:) I still ended up taking some of my home, and it made for a delicious snack the next day! The server was attentive and gave great recommendations on the wine, and the owner came out and chatted with us.He was extremely personable and you could tell he loved what he was doing. I will definitely be back...next time with a different date, lol!  Thanks for a fantastic dinner!"}
{"text":"First time there with a party of 7 for dinner on November 11. Lovely atmosphere and overall very refined European-style cooking and presentation let down by only a few misteps. Somewhat grumpy 'reception' by the hostess (I don't think we saw her smile once) and it took them quite a while to seat us even though we were already late. We immediately had to ask them to put out a heavily scented candle in the reception area near our table which I've never seen in a fine dining restaurant. Sommelier/waiter was charming and knowledgeable. Cauliflower soup was wonderful. All dishes were very refined although we thought the Sea Bass was a bit more oily than usual. Overall the best food we've ever had in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing!!!  This restaurant should get five start for ambiance alone (especially outdoors), but the food is five stars as well! Everything we tried was better than the course before it.  If you are looking for the perfect special occasion place for dinner - don't look any further, you've found it!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience last night. My wife and I have eaten at many fine restaurants in Chicago, San Francisco, NOLA and this four course meal, the service, the wine pairing and the ambiance was as good as any. Sitting outside in an intimate courtyard with real candles everywhere was the perfect romantic end to a short trip to Phoenix for our Global Entry interview."}
{"text":"Loved café Monarch. We went there for our 5 year anniversary and it was the perfect place. If the weather is nice, I recommend sitting on the patio. Very romantic! Such a great concept - simple yet delightful menu. We also met the owner Chris and their chef. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food tastes great! Waiters were very generous! Recommended!"}
{"text":"Incredible! What can one say? It's like eating in a master chef's house.  6 stars ******"}
{"text":"We loved everything it's a perfect get away for brunch. Can't wait to dine for dinner. Wish there were more like it. Don't forget to bring your own wine and make reso for dinner, Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful and romantic ambience. Absolutely loved the outdoor courtyard, but if you can't get a seat outside then the inside is beautiful as well. I felt like I was back in Europe. Service was excellent and very attentive. There were two price options for their prixe fixed menus, $80 per person and i think the other was $65, worth it. Cauliflower soup was my favorite. I got the chilean sea bass which was a little dry for my taste but still good. My bf got the filet mignon which was great. Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Truly a dining experience! Some of the best ambiance and decor and the food and drinks are delicious. Loved all of the 4 courses and the attention to detail. If you are in the area this is definitely a memory to make--request the back patio."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what word could describe this place. It's special. Truly one of a kind. From the moment you enter, you'll experience exceptional service. Every employee knows the menu- from where the food comes from to where the salt comes from - no lie! I heard a waiter explaining where their salt came from. Unreal. Richard, you're awesome and congrats on you're upcoming wedding. To the owners, you're doing it right... better than right. Keep it up."}
{"text":"It is such a nice neighborhood. The decoration looks like ltalian Cafes. Food is delicious and they are behaving so friendly and take a good care of you. But the problem is that you can not just go there for a cake or coffee. We were looking in yelp for a good place to have coffee and ended up there. They just have fixed menus that you have to choose one of the limited options they have and each of the options is super expensive. 65$ per person. When we arrived there the waitress said we have to choose one of the options in fixed menu beside our coffee if we want to sit there and when we ordered, we just found out it's gonna be 65$ per person. Then if you are planning to go there, just consider that it's mandatory for you to spent a certain amount of money at least."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite restaurants in Scottsdale.  It's a great spot for a romantic evening. We sat in the patio which is lit by candlelight and strung lights. The ambiance is gorgeous.  All of our servers were knowledgeable and very down to earth.  The menu had a very wide range of options. I chose one item from each of the four courses. The cauliflower soup is the best soup I've ever tasted. This was followed by a winter salad (delicious), a glorified seafood taco (also delicious) and a sea bass (incredibly delicious). The desserts were out of this world. We shared the bananas foster & the rum cake. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is mesmerizing!!! I can't believe it took so long for us to try cafe monarch. My wife and I went in last night to celebrate both of our birthdays and can equally agree that this was the best meal we have been to in 8-12 months. The atmosphere was amazing and our server Wesam hit the mark above and beyond in all aspects I will absolutely recommend and return to cafe monarch very soon"}
{"text":"Worst Service to fast ,I really didn't need to here about how the owner and chef keeps all the tips. I did like the food but server was to personal.By the way if what the server told me was true I think it a shame that the owner would take the servers tips."}
{"text":"We walked in without a reservation after the dinner rush about 8:30pm and got a table, it was a Saturday night so I was happy. I had tried to call for a reservation but the phone just rang. The patio outside is one of the most romantic spots I've ever been too. I was very excited when I saw the room, unfortunately for us it was a prix fixe menu which we both are not fans of. The place has an extremely small kitchen so this is done so everything can be pre-made to keep up with the customers orders. You get soup or salad a meat or fish and a dessert not much of a choice all were quite ordinary. The staff was great, owner was there walking around and asking about the food and service. I didn't have the heart to tell him everything was served cold my biggest complaint about dining. I hate cold food to me it's a real faux pas for an establishment. I totally understand their plight because the place is so small which is usually a real plus for me. My old chef told me many years ago that places that seat over 75 serve bad food. I may have just hit a bad night and most folks give it rave reviews. I'm not a fan of poached fish either and that was what I had since my wife got the meat dish. Was back in Scottsdale recently but did not return to Café Monarch."}
{"text":"Second time at Cafe Monarch. First time GREAT. Second time: same atmosphere, good service, more tables, but of the two entre choices (veal chop or shrimp cake) the shrimp cake was not very tasty and the veal chop was sold out. Although we were pretty disappointed we will try it again."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday lunch after a massage. My husband had the pumpkin soup with no volunteering to share! I had the panini totally yum. Loved the intimacy and delicious food. I will put this place on my Scottsdale circuit."}
{"text":"Eating here is like being invited to a dear friend's home for dinner, only your pal in the kitchen is a masterful chef.  I really respect what Chef Christopher does with his tiny workspace and limited support staff.  You generally get a choice of two tasty entrees - that's it.  But you can expect both dishes to be fresh, tasty, complex and atypical. I appreciate the BYOB concept, with the unbelievably cheap $10 corking fee.   If you're looking for a vast menu, or a hurried meal, or a place that accepts credit cards, look no further than Cheesecake Factory. If you view every meal as your last as I do, treat yourself to an exceptional dining experience with your bestie or partner at Cafe Monarch."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in Scottsdale.  The setting was awesome, the cocktails were on point, the food exceeded every expectation and the service blew us away.  I will be making this a regular spot to visit moving forward.  Side Note: Try \"The Spaniard\", best cocktail on the menu!  A big thanks to the Owner and Service Team at Cafe Monarch!"}
{"text":"Very very good   Off the cuff breakfast sandwich   Host chef waiter and a wealth of knowledge!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place exceeded my expectations, even after I had read all the great recommendations!  Each course was creative and flawlessly executed, and the flavors were out of this world.  The only course that lagged was dessert- it was good, but it fell a bit flat, especially after the wonders which preceeded it.  But overall- amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner last night and it was not a good experience.  The food was mediocre at best with strange flavor combinations.  There was not a single course that we thought was superb and the limited number of options was frustrating.  We actually went to another restaurant immediately afterwards and had a proper dinner because neither of us liked our food and barely ate anything.  The room is also extremely small and you feel as though you are sitting on top of everyone else as the tables are all pushed very close together.  Needless to say, we will not be returning and would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale on a short vacation and dined at Cafe Monarch's new location last night. It is across the street from their old location. Our server told us they had moved only 3 weeks prior. The restaurant decor is beautiful! We were seated in the patio area which had a very romantic ambience.  A fireplace and space heaters were enough to provide heat on that beautiful evening.  We were impressed at the outset because they offered us seats at the bar and offered us 2 glasses of wine (my husband had one) after we were informed that our table wasn't ready for us when we arrived on time for our reservation. We didn't have to wait longer than 15 minutes for our table.  We were pleasantly surprised to find the four-course prix-fixe menu to be very well-priced.  The first 3 courses were delicious (roasted cauliflower soup or rock shrimp, winter salad, crab cake) and my husband especially enjoyed his main course,  filet mignon. My only complaint was that my sea bass, though cooked perfectly, was under-seasoned and the bananas foster beignets did not meet our expectation.    We thought the service was on point. Our server and support team were all friendly and very attentive. We got to chat with our server for quite a bit about the Scottsdale area. If we find ourselves in the area in the future, we would not hesitate to dine here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Very attentive service and the 4 course meal was excellent.  We were celebrating my wife's birthday and they went out of their way to make it special without me even asking.  Our go to romantic restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing. No menu; chef prepares a 3-course dining experience that you won't regret. There was one choice for the 1st course, a nice sizes salad; two choices for the main course, and a dessert. When you call to make reservations the chef personally speaks to you to find out if you have any food allergies or dislikes. Intimate setting, great atmosphere. BYOB"}
{"text":"I don't feel like writing too much about the place. Just come and try it! IMHO it is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Three of us went to Cafe Monarch last night and to begin, I am not the owners mother, but it was one of the best if not the best meals we have ever had! Two of us had the fish and one the steak. We thought they were both outstanding as were the rest of the courses, especially the cauliflower soup.   The only change I would make would be instead of including 3 first courses,  to have 2 and then include dessert.   As to service, the swarm of waiters met our every need. Steven was wonderful! We can hardly wait!  Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Everything we ate here was tasty. The food was excellent and the waiter was professional and very knowledgable. Sitting in the patio at night enjoying the desert weather is hard to beat. Pricey but well worth it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant could stack up to any New York Michelin star restaurant.  As word gets out, Monarch Cafe will eventually put Scottsdale on the world scene.  The friendly wait staff, the ambience, the food and wine pairing option...all first rate. Did I mention that for a crowded and busy atmosphere, the acoustics at our table were suitable to an intimate conversation with our guests.  This is a destination restaurant that I will remember for a long, long time and will I assure you I will be a regular patron."}
{"text":"My very sweet fiancé likes to surprise me with our Valentine's Day dinner, and this time I had no idea where we were going until we were literally in the parking lot.  This is truly a hidden gem, as I'd have never guessed it was there and had only heard the name as some fabled, awesome Yelp page.  One of the great things about this restaurant is the ambiance.  I think it was once a house, and it retains the charm of a well cared for home.  The bathroom even feels homey.  If you are able, get a table on the patio... the greenery all around, candles and lanterns make for a relaxing atmosphere.    For Valentine's Day, the prix fixe menu had an amuse buche of lobster bisque, an arugula salad with poached pea, brie, sliced beet and a light dressing, and the option of either filet or sea bass for the entree.  We ordered one of each entree, which was the best decision.  We split both, and I honestly can't say which one I would have chosen if I'd had to.  I usually opt for steak over fish, but the sea bass was so tender and flavorful, and sitting on the bed of bacon jam with the side of avocado cucumber salad, it was delicious.  A major rival of the filet with crab meat and potatoes, which says a lot. Dessert was a Kahlua Chocolate Cake with strawberry coulis; I don't usually love chocolate cake if it's too rich, but this one struck the right balance.    We had a sparkling wine with dinner, with the cucumber infused water.  It takes a lot to make me enjoy plain water, but infusing it with just about anything will do it!    Finally, the service was top-notch.  Everyone here was professional and classy, and made us feel important and classy as well.  It was a wonderful experience and wonderful food... it definitely makes the list for great spots for a romantic or special occasion dinner."}
{"text":"This fine dining restaurant has a nice romantic atmosphere, but the five star food and service are the star of the show!   One of the very best restaurants in Scottsdale.   Plan to make your reservations far in advance.   The chef is brilliant with the flavors and menu inspiration!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place for lunch and had a great experience. It felt like we were at Chef Chris's house with the dining tables right next to the open kitchen. He was very welcoming and friendly. I think it's amazing he does everything! We had a large group of 8 which can be overwhelming for a small place, but he was very gracious and managed to accommodate us and we had the dishes served family style which worked out well. Definitely recommended. As the other reviews state, this place is a one man show, so be prepared to wait. But when you have great friends, great food, and a beautiful day, it's time well spent to slow down and savor the experience."}
{"text":"An absolute delicious dinner paired with a romantic atmosphere. I couldn't have asked for a more wonderful experience at Café Monarch. The waiter was extremely courteous and knowledge. As for chef Chris he was a pleasure and sat and chatted with my date and I as well as another couple. I would certainly recommend this restaurant for many reasons but above all the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"Where to begin...I don't think there is one thing that I did not like about this place! I finally got a chance to visit this hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale on a Wednesday evening around 7pm. The ambiance itself was breathtaking. It is truly what I would  picture a hidden garden to be like lit with candles throughout the dining area. Seating is limited and you must call in advance. You have the option to be seated inside or outside and I would highly recommend you reserve a seat in the garden if you are looking for fireworks this place has to offer. It literally screams ROMANCE!!! As of now, there is about a 2 week wait to reserve seating on both Friday and Saturday.  My friend and I were blessed to have Christian Lewkowicz, the new owner of Cafe Monarch, wait on us throughout the evening. He provided us with a the history of how Cafe Monarch came to be, his vision, the personal touch he has made to the decor including his lovely display of his grandmother's paintings throughout the restaurant and the much more.   The menu changes daily for dinner they offer an amuse bouche, salad, main course, and a dessert as their pre-fixed offerings. The portions are much larger than I thought they would be. I loved the idea of a pre-fixed menu, because it helps those who tend to choose the same thing every meal to live outside the box! Overall, the food was cooked to perfection and arrived at the right time every time:)   To end the night Christian Lewkowicz took his already over the top customer service to a whole new level and offered to give us a private tour of the kitchen, which was the icing on the cake. It was a much smaller set up than I imagined and it still amazes me how much work and creativity comes out of such a small space.  I am already planning my next visit for brunch with my girlfriends and look forward to another priceless experience:) Thanks Christian!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that I am a total food snob. I am fortunate enough to be able to dine at 3 Michelin Star restaurants regularly in NYC. That being said, my job takes me on the road all over the country weekly and I am usually disappointed by what there is across the US.   However, this meal was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. I cannot stress how impressed I was and will definitely keep tabs on this chef and dine here whenever my job brings me back to the Phoenix area.   I made sure to call the manager over to deliver my compliments. I must also stress that I have never complimented a restaurant to the manager proactively.   Thank you so much for such a delicious meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant achieves every aspect of the experience one is looking for in a superb meal.  As self-proclaimed foodies, my husband and I never waste our time on mediocre meals. We chose Monarch based upon reviewed as our special meal during our trip to Scottsdale from Portland (a foodie capital).  The ambiance is romantic, with everything taken into account--lighting, decor, table spacing, and temperature.  The service was excellent, with staff for every aspect of one's dining experience.  The food, oh the food. This is a prix fix menu and I generally shy away from these because I don't eat red meat and I like to select my own food. You cannot go wrong with Monarch's chef. I'm not going to describe anything we ate because I wanted to savor the experience rather than take photos or notes. I will say that the chef pays particular attention to multiple complementary flavors and textures in each dish. Every bite is sublime; there is so much going on in your mouth.  If I lived here, this is the restaurant I would bring/send guests to to impress them with the cuisine of my town."}
{"text":"Took my wife there on a weekend getaway, and we were very happy with the taste and quality of food for the price.  In NY the price would have been twice the price.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes, for every reason all the 5 star reviews state below!  Multiple trips to wine country with more than my (small) wine fridge will hold, this is exactly the place I want to crack these bottles open and let the atmosphere and food wash over me.  Hey...though I love to cook at home, I admit my meals do not justify these bottles' price tags. :P  So bring your beautiful wine and enjoy the evening away...  actually bring 2-3 bottles and decide what you are going to pour once you hear the menu  ;)  PS.  Just talking to Chris on the phone, he has more personality than some folks exhibit their entire lives!"}
{"text":"Cash only.   We went here for lunch and were not disappointed.   The food was amazing as was the service.   The menu was rather limited but everything on it sounded amazing.  The chef/waiter/owner did an excellent job of providing excellent service and amazing food.  He suggested some slight variations to the dish I ordered and I could not have been more pleased.   The mac and cheese side dish was the best I have ever had.  I will definitely go back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Amazing from start to finish! Spectacular service with amazing food. I began with the best gazpacho I've ever had, a yellow heirloom tomato and cucumber concoction, followed by watermelon and arugula salad, soft shell crap with spicy papaya and a main course of beet gnocchi and seared scallops. My husband had salmon carpaccio for his first course and filet minion for his 4th. We were both very impressed by the intense and dynamic flavors of each dish and the perfection of the proteins. And because it was our anniversary they even surprised us with a gift and delicious chocolate cake dessert. My husband got the four course wine pairing and our somliér was very friendly and impressive with each serving. If great food and service isn't enough the ambience and atmosphere is very unique and gives you a feeling of a very special occasion."}
{"text":"I, too, found Cafe Monarch on Yelp. Chef Chris and I played phone tag a few times, but we finally got reservations. My party of nine ended up getting Easter brunch, and for $20 we felt it was a great deal. We got a poached salmon salad (amazing dressing and fresh peas!) and a cashew chicken with Japanese black rice. They were served family style and delicious. The coffee, hibiscus iced tea,  and dessert course was also included in the price. Unfortunately we didn't take advantage of the BYO-champagne since we partied a little too much the previous night :)  Chef Chris came out after our meal to chat with us and he was hilarious! He is probably the only person who can get away with calling his guest an elitist cougar :) (Don't worry, it doesn't sound as bad as you think!)  This is a dining experience you should not miss. Take your time to enjoy the atmosphere (maybe eat in the patio area when it's cooler). I'm off to tell my friends in Phoenix to try it out, and I hope to visit Cafe Monarch if I'm ever back in the area."}
{"text":"Only sad part of lunch was that it wasn't the full dinner experience.  We found this place on Yelp while in town for a conference and got to have a deliciously awesome lunch for under $30 for 2.    We had a roasted veggie crostini and shrimp+polenta.  Both were perfection. Again, only issue here was that we wanted to sit there for the rest of our vacation and eat everything Chef Chris makes.  Nonstop.  The space is truly special, as if you are eating in your friends rustic house while they are cooking you up a culinary masterpiece.  The lunch was unforgettable, and we'll have to make it back for hours of evening eating."}
{"text":"Food was fairly good but my fish was undercooked 4 stars for atmosphere and the dinner overall was very nice plus BYOB and corking service."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with ahhhmazing food.  Very creative and every bite was just as good as the first bite.  Cocktails were great as well.  Probably my new favorite restaurant in AZ"}
{"text":"I'm still licking my chops. The most phenomenal dining experience in years. The patio was so intense...romantic, warm, inviting. The food could be garbage and the atmosphere would make up for it. But the food is unreal!  I can't recall a restaurant that hits all the important notes like this one. Everything about this place is geared to the experience. I found this by accident. We were staying at the Valley Ho. I'm still in mourning over the loss of Trader Vic's. Looking for something interesting, the decor jumped right out! What a pleasant surprise.  What tells the tale as far as quality, is that I didn't have an upset stomach when I turned in for the night. And I wasn't hungry when I woke the next morning. I can't recall ever enjoying dinner as much as this one. I live 1500 miles away and will fly down just to have dinner. It's that good."}
{"text":"I think I expected too much going in to Cafe Monarch, so maybe I had just set the bar too high but I was a little underwhelmed with the experience.  The service was very friendly and attentive... in the beginning. Towards the end of my mom's and my meal, we felt sort of forgotten about.  I was expecting Chef Chris to call and confirm my reservation, based on other Yelpers reviews, which he did not. I was also hoping he would stop by my table, since I had specifically mentioned it was my first time coming and my mom was in town visiting from across the country. He did not stop by the table, but did talk to several other tables around us.  I had also mentioned we were celebrating my mom's birthday a week early, not in hopes of getting anything since the prix fixe menu Chef Chris offers already comes with dessert, but just so maybe someone would mention something to my mom and make her feel special. I wasn't very pleased when the three tables around us were all given their desserts with cute little birthday candles, but nothing for my mom.  As far as the food goes, I really did like both appetizers offered (we ordered one of each and shared), and the shrimp entree was very, very tasty. But neither my mom or I cared for the filet entree, as it was incredibly overcooked (the waitress said the beef would be prepared med-rare, it came out well as well can be) and the polenta served under the filet was very bland.  $45 per person, plus $10 corking fee led to a $108 dinner before tip, which for three courses and booze is pretty reasonable in Scottsdale, I just think I set my mental bar too high.  Cash only, btw."}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch is a treasure.  I'm sad there isn't a place like it back where I live.  I am in town for the weekend and had dinner here last night with my family.  We were taken to the kitchen to meet the chef before we were seated outside in the courtyard.  It was lovely.  We brought a bottle of wine and enjoyed the appetizer: fresh mushrooms, asparagus, roasted bell peppers, proscuitto and pesto with lavash crackers.  It was a generous portion and both my mother and I felt like we could have walked away after the appetizer satisfied!  The two entrees were absolutely fantastic.  Pork with cheddar polenta and some sort of (delicious) new mexico chile sauce.  Scallops fried in panko with arugula and heirloom tomatoes.  We tried both and were very satisfied.  Again, the portion was quite healthy and we felt totally satisfied.  Dessert was good.  Fresh berried, mango with vanilla ice cream and fried wontons with chocolate sauce and berry sauce.    Service was terrific.  We had a great time and wish we could go back tonight!  If we lived in AZ, we would come back on a weekly basis!"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews unless the business is either outstanding or awful; in this case, cafe Monarch was superb and deserves a review.  The location is now across the street from the old one. While it kept the charms of the old place, it has a much more refined dining room and patio now.  The food is still excellent and so is the service; even the valet was uber accommodating.  The scallops and the cauliflower soup were my favorite dishes.  My husband thinks every dish had a lot of umami flavor."}
{"text":"We just got back from Arizona and we can't stop talking about our experience at Cafe' Monarch; it was an incredible, intimate, and delicious dining experience.  Chef Chris was a warm and funny host, who kept us on our culinary toes, in terms of surprising us with innovative and beautiful dishes that were packed full of flavor.  We have family in Arizona, and now we have two great reasons to visit!  Thanks Chef Chris for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"To be surprised... and joyously so! That's what comes to mind when I think of Cafe Monarch.  It is definitely a place where one can practice the arts of \"going with the flow,\" \"shooting the breeze,\" \"smelling the roses,\" and whatever other cliches you can think of that involve taking the time to enjoy oneself AND the people your with AND the setting that surrounds you... It's about being here and now and definitely not in a hurry. If you can do that, then, you will have a wonderful time.  It's an interesting dynamic. If you walk in, everything will be a surprise... but the man of all trades in the land of the Monarchs, Christopher, will accomodate you as best he can with the ingredients he has on hand that day. It is a very casual conversation you will have with him in lieu of selecting off a menu. You'll discuss allergies, likes & dislikes and what's available in the kitchen. The day a friend and I went, Christopher was cooking lamb... he described it has very Mediterranean with olives and I immediately stated my un-love affair with the pitted fruit. He then said he could make a lovely orange glaze and both my friend and I said that'd be wonderful... and oh was it... the Lamb, the Spinach with Barley and Pineapple... the pretty Tomatillo and Roasted Pepper... all of it was DIVINE! (Refer to pics to drool and be jealous). If you were vegetarian or vegan or didn't eat lamb, at this point in the scenario, the experience may not be the best it could be, so you see, you must be open minded and equipped with foodie cojones just walking up to an establishment like Cafe Monarch and just in case, be equipped with a Plan B restaurant... if you do end up using the Plan B, I feel very sorry for you... you'll be missing out!  A better way to go if you are picky, or have a specific allergies/diets is to make reservations for dinner and discuss all that with Christopher prior to dining. I have yet to try this, but can't wait for my second dining experience at dinner time! Whichever way you choose to approach this unique cafe, there is an element of Chef-surprise, and I think that is SPECIAL and we are lucky to have Cafe Monarch in Metro Phoenix... it truly is an experience.  One final tip: Bring CASH, Christopher only deals in \"paper.\" And this can be another analogy... Plastic = Fake, Paper = Real = Cafe Monarch!"}
{"text":"Like eating at a friend's house.  If your friend happens to be a great chef and a charming host."}
{"text":"Went for valentines and it was wonderful. It was a fixed menu w a few different options and everything we had was great. The service was spot on and I would definitely recommend them for a very nice or romantic dinner!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the deliciousness! Ambiance is fabulous!!! Had the Chilean Sea Bass which was amazing...buttery, smooth, delish. Hubs had the filet. Great! Though he thought the 3rd course beef Wellington was \"magnificent\". Everyone was so attentive and kind. Best place for a sweet romantic dinner. Can't wait to come back again. Make reservations far in advance especially if you want courtyard seating."}
{"text":"Chris at Cafe Monarch is an extremely talented and inventive chef who puts those skills to good use making great food that's healthy, tasty and satisfying.  If you want single bits of exquisite ravioli, one pea and some coconut foam, you're at the wrong place.  If you want a great meal, read on.  We went for his Smokehouse Sunday - the best ribs I have *ever* had, great chicken, great sides.  We've been for lunch - amazing salads, a fantastic take on the BLT: now, I understand, off the menu, and I can't wait to see what's replaced it..  BYOB; there's a reasonable selection at the Circle K round the corner, and their walk-in beer fridge is a great place to spend five minutes when the sun's beating down outside."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful evening at cafe monarch on our first day in the Phoenix area.  We sat outside in the courtyard.  The weather was perfect, the atmosphere so peaceful and beautifully appointed with lights, candles and plants.   The food was just delicious; each course was superb.  We especially loved the scallop 'extra'; wholeheartedly recommend.   Too bad we live on the East coast!   Will highly recommend to anyone visiting (or lucky enough to live local)"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best atmosphere if you sit in the court yard. Food was outstanding and so was the service. I highly recommend this place.  They even offered us skewers of ahi and steak as we waited for out table. You won't regret this adventure."}
{"text":"We went there with my husband for NYE while visiting Phoenix. We knew they had a special 4 course dinner which we made the reservation for but unfortunately our airplane was delayed. We called to see what they can do and even though they said their kitchen was closing very soon they went above and beyond to help us out. We ended up being an hour late so they could not serve all 4 courses,  but Christian (one of the owners) was super helpful, served us more than we expected and gave us special discount. The food was amazing (I got the fillet mignon and my husband the sea bass), the service was excellent, the wine great too, the environment so warm and romantic. I would absolutely recommend it and will certainly be going back. Thank you Christian!"}
{"text":"If my husband and I lived a bit closer to Scottsdale we'd be here every weekend! Everything we ordered was so flavorful and the restaurant was so romantic without being overdone. Definitely reccomend sitting on the patio, just breathtaking. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of the price points. Food was delicious but the portion sizes were a bit small for the high price. Overall great experience though."}
{"text":"QUESTION: If you're in Arizona and can only do one thing, which do you choose:  (a) Gaze upon the Grand Canyon. (b) Hike the trails of Sedona. (c) Tour Kartchner Caverns (d) Dine at Café Monarch  Believe it or not, the answer is (d) and here's why.  The hole in the ground, the red rocks and the bat-cave have all been around for thousands of years, and will continue to be around for many lifetimes. You can see them anytime and they're not going anywhere.    Now we are all traveling mortals, placed on this earth for a finite time.  You, me, and Chris (the chef at Café Monarch) are no exception.  Now I wish all of us, including Chris (the waiter at Café Monarch) a long and prosperous life.  But lets face it; none of us know what our Creator has in store for us, and that includes Chris (the host at Café Monarch).  Also, we never know when the landlord is going to sell our shop's location to turn it into a Wal-Mart, and this goes for the place leased by Chris (the busboy at Café Monarch).  Finally, we never know where we're going to be in a few years.  For example, we could fall in love with someone special and move back to New York City and this includes Chris (the dishwasher at Café Monarch).  Let me put it to you another way... If Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel in disappearing ink, wouldn't you rush off to see it?    Some works of art or natural beauty will last forever.  But when food is art it must be experienced (i.e. eaten) hot off the grill and whenever you can get it.  So when the medium of the 'genius-artist' is food, you have to grab every opportunity to experience the masterpiece.  Chris brings a passion to his cooking.  He tells us that cooking became a necessity as a child, but it was also his chosen form of creative outlet.  He has developed an intuitive ability to combine flavors, spices and textures.  He provides beautiful presentations that are layered with tastes... you and your pals will be guessing at the ingredients.  This \"artwork\" is tasty, healthy and generously portioned.  All for about 40 bucks plus a $10 corking fee.  Arizona is lucky to have Chris feeding a few selected diners who are smart enough to make reservations.  Go see (and eat) this man's art."}
{"text":"Incredible!  We went for our first time two years ago and had to go back when we came back to town for a little vaca. The food is amazing and I can't say enough about the staff. Sit outside if it's available and do the wine pairing if you can splurge. Not cheap but worth every penny. I've eaten all over the world and this little gem is in my top three."}
{"text":"My Husband and I had a wonderfully romantic dinner at Cafe Monarch recently to celebrate my Birthday.  This gem is tucked away on a street in Old Town Scottsdale and is so cute and inviting from the moment you pull up to the parking lot.  Upon our arrival we were asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside.  Given it was over 100 degrees outside we were taken aback, but reassured that the outside patio was very cool (thanks to misters) and quite nice.  I'm so glad we did because it is so cute, romantic, and peaceful out on the patio, just the right setting for this lovely dinner.  As many of said, the menu is pre-fixed and includes 4 courses.  When we went, I was so happy the everything on the menu looked good and met my taste.  We had some kind of bruchetta for appetizer, which was awesome.  It was a touch salty, but that did bring out the flavors of everything else.  The salad course was good as well... could have done without the frisee lettuce (personal preference), but LOVED the beets.  For our entree we both opted for the filet.  The sauce was to die for and the steak was cooked to perfection.  Again, the salt was very aggressive, but everything else was so tasty, we were able to overlook that.  For dessert we had a chocolate cake concoction that was quite good.  Cafe Monarch is a unique restaurant and a must for any foodie.  The time and attention given at this restaurant is match by few others.  They even gave me a beautiful candle for my Birthday!  Can't wait to give Cafe Monarch another try for a special occasion in the future."}
{"text":"This was my first fine dining experience. My friend and I are spoiled when it comes to good food (quality family cooks and cooks ourselves). Let me just say the atmosphere is gorgeous. The service incredible, the best I've ever experienced. I was surprised with the menu, in a disappointing way. Basically, meat in almost all courses. Really no palate cleansing anywhere. All the flavors were just a little overwhelming after the third course. Strangely, I don't know if it was just what I chose, but everything tasted sweet. The cauliflower soup was the absolute most delicious soup I've ever ordered. The only Earthy, salty flavor I had. It was a lot of fun, but we craved salt and spice afterwards. We do not regret going at all."}
{"text":"Went there for our 38th anniversary.  Have been here several times and food is very good.  Sat in courtyard and found it to be very romantic although extremely crowded.  Seating should be limited in the courtyard and crammed together.  Biggest disappointment was while I had made a 7 pm reservation they told us our table wasn't quite ready so they proceeded to sit us outside on the front patio to wait and then took cocktail orders.  We noticed they did this with every party that arrived after us.  We didn't get seated until 7:45, two cocktails later!  VERY DISAPPOINTING.  No apology so I guess this is the standard for customer service here.  Definitely lowered the bar and I have removed them from my list for special occasions.  10 - 15 minutes delay is acceptable but 45 minutes is a management issue with over booking."}
{"text":"I try to approach food reviews with a bowl full of practicality.  After all, it's just food right?  Someone makes it for you.  You eat it.  It goes to your stomach and you get full.  The collection of tastes, regardless of magnificence, are quickly filed into your culinary memory shortly after you pay and go on your merry way, reserving a moment to determine the probability of your return.    Café Monarch is a place where you can go to eat.   A restaurant by definition.   But to simply lump it into that broad classification is criminal.  Mind you, I despise flowery, over-hyped statements seemingly assigned to all things food (and wine) but this place is so much more than a restaurant.  It left me  desperately trying to grasp and hold the sensations of food, wine, atmosphere, music, service, comfort and how they all seemed to work in harmony to make our visit remarkable.   I'm a practical man and mostly grown up.  I try not to get caught up in hype or revel in the splendor of things like froe gras and Manila clam chowder or something called a Winter Salad which were all among best things I've ever put in my mouth.  But I couldn't help it.  I found myself eating each course more intently, careful not to overlook a taste, and to appreciate the complexity of flavors and the work that must go into each production.  I didn't want it to end.    You will read enough reviews about their food, and I understand it changes weekly, but ours was spectacular.  I am certain I would have enjoyed it while sitting on a rusted tailgate in the middle of nowhere, but I am also certain the deliberate attempt to create such ambiance made my food and wine taste even better.  Our servers were accommodating, wildly-attentive and wine-knowledgeable never once demanding my wine taste of Sandalwood - which I have yet to taste in any wine.  Ever.  The restroom was spotless, reminded me of a Parisian sitting room and smelled like flowers or the exact opposite of how restrooms usually smell, which was nice - even for a man.  The space, though relatively small, is cleverly conceived and just plain cool and undeniably romantic, especially the patio, with its tasteful lighting, vine and plant-laden fences and enough space heaters to make everyone comfortable on what was a typical winter's eve.    The lofty recommendation to visit Café Monarch for the first time generated such heavy expectations which usually leads to disappointment on some level.  But there was not a shred of disappointment in any aspect of our experience.  In fact, everyone in our party shared the same sentiment that we had all experienced something very intentional and marvelous.  Something we are still reliving a few weeks after our visit.  Something we all long to experience again.  I can say without hesitation the worst part of the entire night was that eventually it had to come to an end.  Thank you Cafe Monarch for making such an impression."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make it out to the Ole Cafe Monarch till the last day of the season!  Today, It was his memorial day BBQ.  Absolutely amazing.  The Rib sauce had a slight tang, but was also rich and deep to the palette.  The chicken glaze was different and was so good and really could stop to think of what ingredient might have made its mightiness.  Home made mac-n-cheese yes please!  It was so good I ate almost the entire cup.   My family humiliated the giant plate of ribs and chicken without hesitation.  Delish!  A note on the regular season...  there is really no better place to get a meal, especially a romantic on,  this is the place.  Bring your own bottle of wine or two and get a 3 course meal in authentic fashion from Chris.  The price is ridicules for what you get.  In a good way I mean.  Visit it next year in September.  You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to celebrate our 31st anniversary. It had been recommended by a friend. It was a beautiful experience. Lovely, tasty food presented gorgeously. The service was attentive but not overbearing, and they really made our day feel special. It is also a beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"BEST DINING EXPERIENCE, in a very long time! My boyfriend surprised me and took us to Cafe Monarch, for our weekly date night. I had never been and was shocked at how beautiful the outside seating is!    The ambiance is perfectly romantic, with hanging lights, huge lanterns, candles and water fountains. The service is spectacular. All the servers are extremely knowledgeable and very attentive. And the valet was fast.  The menu does not have a huge selection, but you will not be disappointed. It's a four-course meal, with the pricing based on your largest and final course. The portions are on the smaller size, but after the entire meal, you feel full. The best thing on the menu is the cauliflower soup. If you go, you MUST try it."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow!! Wow on their service!! Wow on the friendliness!! And wow on their food!!!!  I threw my sister a baby shower in the garden and they were amazing!! I want to thank them for all they did the weather was off so they inside prepared for us just in case we wanted to go inside. If I ever throw another party it will for sure be there!! Thank you again Philip, Christian and your beautiful mom and staff!"}
{"text":"went there a few weeks aro ti celebrate muy husband's birthday. We had such a nice dinner! so delicious , I had never tasted a watermelon, beet and ricotta salad so good!  If you go , get the wine pairings for your dinner, totally worth it and will make the ocassion even more special. our server was really helpful and nice and even noticed some obnoxious girl who kept laughing to the top of her lungs next to us and suggested to turn up the music up a bit. ;)"}
{"text":"It was an experience not to be forgotten. The food was delicious and our server Richard was so knowledge and enthusiastic! Amazing experience!"}
{"text":"5 stars for a great setting decorated perfectly along with a stellar lunch treat. Decor goes with the atmosphere and food, which feels like you're eating at a friend's house. Kitchen is open to the dining room. We stopped in 15 minutes before lunch closed up, and Chris was nice enough to take our order. Felt like having your own personal chef. Really a cool eating experience all around. He was also really sweet to our 1 year old, and gave her a few things to distract her while we ate."}
{"text":"The BF found this place on Yelp and promptly made a reservation for a 10 person dinner. I was especially intrigued by the idea of unique menu semi catered to your preferences.   We arrived Sunday evening and was greeted (by name) by the owner/chef/one man show Chris. He told us that even though he was feeling under the weather, he was still going to serve us dinner and with a smile too!   I was amazed at his ability to make a meal even with 10 different taste preferences (vegetarian, no red meat, not too much cheese, etc etc. we were a picky bunch). We had this zesty pesto pasta, a really yummy herb spinach salad, some rib thing (grilled pear for me, the vegetarian), and frickin' DELICIOUS blueberry marscapone waffle dessert. Al that food + BYOB = happy, happy Peggy.  I totally recommend this place because of the great ambiance, personalized service, and the curiosity/mystery of not knowing exactly what you're going to be eating! Plus, Chris has a great personality to boot.  It's approx $40/person plus $10/cork fee. Cash only, so come prepared!  Oh and I highly recommend a reservation."}
{"text":"#1 in Scottsdale/Phoenix Area! #1 Most Romantic Restaurant in the Country by Yelp!! Wow!!!!! Looking for the perfect location for a romantic dinner? This is it!  Intimate candlelit courtyard with a table by the fire -  perfect ambience! Chris (Sam) and Jacob were amazing! So friendly and welcoming. Their attention to detail and knowledgeable of the wine and cuisine they were pairing and presenting made for an enlightening and fascinating evening. Chef Gus and his team will blow your mind with their exquisite culinary creations. Every morsel on this menu is worth a Michelin Star! Thank you for the lovely evening with my sweetheart! You made our experience a memory we will cherish."}
{"text":"The setting could not be more perfect - an sweet outdoor patio with a glimpse inside of a small rustic interior, the entire operation carefully orchestrated by the chef/owner Christopher. We had a delightful brunch, felt we could be in Provence, and ate the most wonderful and interesting food. It was a sort of quiche but lighter and taller, filled with sausage and topped with a delicate sprinkling of cheese. A beautiful green salsa sauce well placed to the side and some divine-ish asparagus, artichokes and mushrooms to the other side, made the symphony of flavors complete. Our second visit to Cafe Monarch was just as wonderful as visit #1 for a Saturday lunch.  Now, we are delightfully planning our first evening visit to enjoy the 3-course dinner and showcase this gem to our visitors from CT in late April."}
{"text":"My favorite place to dine, possibly on the entire planet. Beautiful ambience, incredible service, impressive wines and a delightful, eye-opening culinary experience EVERY time. If you have a special occasion or you just suffer from really good taste and incredibly high standards, you MUST experience Monarch. Thanks to Christian and his amazing team for bringing us this Scottsdale gem!"}
{"text":"This is an exceptional restaurant both when it comes to food, wine and atmosphere. Any special occasion or date night will be a success at this establishment!!!"}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to its reputation. Went there on Saturday with my wife for our anniversary dinner. From the moment we walked in, every employee we came into contact with wished us a happy anniversary. Per my wife's request, they sat us in a corner out on the patio, which is a very beautiful and romantic setting.   Our server was great. We ordered a bottle of wine and he asked if we'd like to just sit and enjoy it before we ordered our food. As we were going through the ordering process, the wife was having a hard time deciding between two dishes (standard issue :-)). Anyway, she chose one and when the entrees were delivered, they had taken it upon themselves to serve us an extra entree so the wife could have some of both.   At the end of the meal, they served a special dessert and actually gave my wife a small, yet nice present (not something you just chuck in the trash).  The food was excellent. The service was superb. The atmosphere couldn't have been much better. The only thing that I was disappointed in was that my wine choice didn't hold a candle to the food, but that's my own fault.  Cannot recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"I reviewed this restaurant before and gave it the highest rating.  My wife and I returned the other night and it is still hitting the highest level of achievement.  We had the filet mignon and it was done perfectly.  Service was great and the ambiance was delightful."}
{"text":"The most charming, beautiful and amazing restaurant I've ever been to. The food was superb! I wish they would open one in Vegas!"}
{"text":"What a truly amazing place, Christopher is a true one man show.  Host, Chef, Waiter, Dishwasher he does it all while putting out some amazing food.  There is no skipping on ingredients, quality, flavor or imagination.  I have only eaten at this little gem twice, simply because I live rather far but, both times the food was excellent.  Today I experienced the most amazing breakfast/brunch, the most perfectly cooked eggs with spinach, portobello mushrooms and loads of grated cheese, the eggs were like fluffy clouds just melted in my mouth.  The bacon though was the show stopper, I took the first bite just expecting bacon, what I actually got was a complete explosion in my mouth, I wasn't sure at first what all the the flavors were, confusion to my mind at first bite but,  oh so delicious confusion!  Seems that Christoper doesn't just dish out bacon he drizzles it with honey, then he tops it with finely chopped cilantro and finally mixes in bits of hot red peppers......for an OMG taste.   Crunchy, salty, sweet, spicy, earthy all the flavors so compliment, this is how bacon should always be served!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had Valentine's Day dinner at Cafe Monarch last night. This place was perfect!  It had a very romantic ambience. Make sure to request the patio. The service was good but the food was exceptional. Every single course wowed us. The serving size was just right. Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my wedding anniversary with my husband there! Service was great, food was delicious and romantic atmosphere! We got free champagne, dessert and a little gift! We had a very wonderful dinner and memorable celebration there!"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed. I love the candlelit patio and scenery with live plants. All of the little details in decor fit the mood. The misters were a nice touch because it was a warm evening. The timing with the meal was perfect and the Sea-bass was probably the best I have ever experienced. I loved the large oyster mushrooms in the grain dish, the cauliflower truffle (i think it was the first course soup) had a very piney flavor and was most enjoyable.   My company was special and this was the perfect place for special.  The Owner was our server and we could tell how much he cared that everything was perfect! It was very relaxing and an enjoyable 2 1/2 hours that I wish could have lasted forever.  I hope I will have the pleasure of dining with the Monarchs again in the near future. love"}
{"text":"My husband just surprised me for my birthday with dinner at Cafe Monarch.  It was the most delightful restaurant experience I've ever had.  Every course was delectable.  My cocktail was over the top.  Everything was so full of flavor. It was like a circus of flavors!  The ambiance was so sweet with lit candles and sweet decor.  The customer service was wow!  At the end of our meal I was brought dessert and a lovely little birthday gift too. This has never happened at a birthday meal ever!  I can't wait to go back!  PS ask for Sam as your waiter.  He's amazing!"}
{"text":"I surprised my husband with this dinner for our 9th anniversary. When I made reservations I told them it was our 9th anniversary and I would love for it to be special and romantic. When we got their the first thing they told us was happy anniversary and told us they saved us the most romantic table in the restaurant.  We were lead back to a quiet table in the back corner of the patio tucked away from everyone. There was a personal heater right next to me, candles surrounding us and quiet music. I can honestly say it was the most romantic place we have ever eaten. The food was great- although the ambiance of the restaurant outdid the food! My husband LOVED the filet minion and left me wishing I got that instead of my chicken breast. My husband and I tried scallops for the first time and took one small bite each and knew they just weren't for us. The server took notice and took them off our bill completely!  They also brought us a small gift for our anniversary and a complementary AMAZING dessert.  For our anniversary, they truly blew our socks off- I will recommend this place to EVERYONE. This did not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience and the food is always fantastic."}
{"text":"Such a romantic vibe at our table surrounded by candles outside. Our dinners were delectable (we both chose the filet), and made for such a special evening. Well done, Cafe Monarch!"}
{"text":"Came with a couple brothers for a reunion dinner, plus it was neat seeing something from Scottsdale on OpenTable's Top 100 Restaurants for the year.   Made a reservation for Tuesday night 8:30, but we checked in early at 6:30 and they had a table for us! Apparently they moved across the street 3 weeks ago, so that might not be reflected on OpenTable's spaces. Noah helped us out for the night, and on his recommendation we interspersed the 3 add-on items in our menu to split. Courses 1-3 were meant as appetizers, so $30 more each to turn a 4 course meal into 7 was a great deal for us!  I don't want to spoil too much about the food, but I think it lives up to the expectation (and the price!). A lot of the seafood tasted very clean - some fish I could see being eaten by someone who hates seafood. Some of our entrees included filet and ribeye - easily beats the quality of cook and meat of some of the most acclaimed steakhouses around here. It might actually be the only time I'd recommend the filet over the ribeye, just because it was done that well. And splitting the add-ons is something we all recommend. With the exception of the Maine Diver Scallops that night, they tasted fantastic but might have been too much of one end of the palate before the entrees came out.  That being said, with a 95% perfect meal there will be imperfections. One edge of the pork belly might have been overcooked and crispy for my liking. And admittedly some of the drinks received poor customer reception compared to others - The Sebastian was fantastic enough as the only surviving cocktail of the old location, but the German Chocolate Martini tasted more tart than chocolate, subverting expectations in not a great way. If you aren't sure of the drinks, just ask or stick to their very refreshing infused water.  It's impeccable service really, and easily the best course menu/fancy dinner I've had in Arizona. Michelin Stars aren't a thing here, but the top notch service and well executed food mirrors 1 Star or 2 Star experiences I've had across the country. My only regret is not discovering Cafe Monarch sooner."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant. The patio is soo romantic. They don't really have lights to light up the patio, they have lots of lanterns with candles. It was beautiful! We had a four course dinner and We started out with a califllower soup that was so good. Then a salad with pickled cantaloupe, awesome. I had the filet with Brussel sprouts, sweet potatoe purée and corn, outstanding. My husband had the salmon with rice pilaf, the salmon was cooked perfect. The last thing we had was dessert and I normally don't finish my dessert when ordered. We had a peach crepe with rum and vanilla gelato, it was outstanding! I think we both wanted to lick all of our plates, yes it was that good. I don't think I've had a meal that good in a long time. The staff was also wonderful and on top of things. Very nice! Like I said it was our first time here and it won't be our last. This is my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is the most fascinating place you can ever find in Phoenix. Best food, drinks, and vibes. Make sure to book a week in advance"}
{"text":"So we thought this place would be perfect for our anniversary dinner, and we were right! Very few places in this town where you don't feel overdressed if you're wearing anything nicer than shorts and flip-flops, so this place gets huge thumbs-up for being a \"nice\" restaurant!  Service is attentive and welcoming, but not overbearing. The patio is just lovely. The food was yummy, but -- surprisingly -- NOT uniformly fabulous. The soup and salad were outstanding, as were the totally decadent foie gras and desserts. Entrees, though, fell short. Hubby's ribeye was actually chewy and his veg was so over-carmelized you couldn't recognize they were brussel sprouts. Meanwhile, my roasted beet gnocchi was also tough with little to no beet flavor.  We'll be back, and hope for better entrees next time."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently went here for an early Valentines Day dinner. In summary, this place is magnificent. We are big foodies and have dined at 3 star Michelin restaurants in France and Cafe Monarch is the closest thing in Phoenix to that kind of experience. They put a tremendous amount of rigor and effort into all aspects of the ambiance, the beverages, and the food. I highly recommend this restaurant. For the price of the food with respect to the quality, it is also a great value. The staff is also very, very friendly and very attentive to ensuring you are having a great experience."}
{"text":"Amazing. Delicious. Fantastic. Gorgeous. This place is the best.   Went for my birthday dinner with the family in the spring, and everything on the menu was glorious. The setting is romantic and chic. The service was impeccable. The cocktails from the bar were fantastic. And, the food....SO GOOD. The menu changes every week based on local availability and freshness. I ended up with prawns and lemon ricotta cheese fried in a squash blossom, lump crab and burrata salad, perfectly cooked filet mignon with delicious mashed potatoes, and a tiny butter rum cake for dessert. This cafe quickly went on our list for revisit as soon as possible."}
{"text":"What an amazing hidden gem! I had dinner at Monarch with my husband and another couple, both on our babymoon getaway. I was a little unsure from the parking lot, but once we got to our table out on the patio it was so amazing! So romantic with cafe lights and lanterns and an elegant atmosphere. The food here was so flavorful and well thought out. Our waiter was really great with recommendations and very attentive throughout the 4 courses. They even gave us little celebration gifts for our babymoon. A wonderful experience overall!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!!!! Will NEVER eats at this pretentious restaurant again. Made reservations for Valentine's Day. Received a call back today from some woman demanding a credit card to hold the reservation. Was told that they would be charging $150 per head. If we cancelled anytime before our reservations we would be charged $50 per head. When I made the reservations originally, I was told that I would not be charged for my two year old because he is not capable of eating a four course meal, that I could share with him. The woman on the phone rudely told me he would be charged the full $150 regardless. So $450 for two adults and a two year old!?!??! Forget that and forget this restaurant, damn dolts!!!!!!"}
{"text":"With so many amazing restaurants in Scottsdale my hubby and I try to eat at new places each time we come to town but we ALWAYS make time for a dinner at Monarch. We have 2 kids under 2 and we brought a babysitter with us from Ohio specifically so we could have a date night at Monarch. I don't understand people who don't give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Cafe Monarch.  It was as good as you've all said.  Wonderful atmosphere and the food was ahhhmazing.  Chris is very relaxed and you feel like you are a guest in his home.  I couldn't understand why the open kitchen wasn't a mess?  It was spotlessly clean.  The restaurant itself was charming and hip.  The braised ribs fell off the bone when you tried to pick them up.  I've never ever had anyhing that tender before.  The fried catfish.....delicious. The polenta, even my husband with texture issues said, \"wow, it's addicting\".   The appetizer was a bed of some sort of delicious greens and black eyed peas, topped with a huge slice of a perfect tomato and a cut of goat cheese.  The flavor combination was out of this world.  We both ate every bite.  The dessert was simple but elegant.  Fresh whipping cream, strawberries, a puddle of chocolate and puffed pastry sticks that he readily told us how to make.  He is so kind.  It was definately a 'dining' experience. ...... 2 hours.  We were getting a bit antsy just towards the end and only because we had our child with someone.  No one else was budging, even ones that had been there longer then us.  I thought the prie-fix pricing was low for what we got.  Things like the sprig of mint and a big berry in our water glass that was not only beautiful but delicious!  Considering that he is literally the only person working there, the service is fabulous.   Our water was always filled.  When dusk came we received a darling oil lamp to light our table.  Although the lighting on the porch/patio was perfect anyway.  We brought white wine so an old milk barrell with a beautiful terra cotta urn came to the the table to keep it cool.  The hip thing was that that table next to us had a wood milk crate and an urn brought for them.  The crate was turned to be open towards them and Chris put a candle down in the bottom of it and it was so hip.  He's definately got a nack for ambiance and cool. Most definately a wonderful anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"From beginning to end a wonderful dining experience New Year's Eve was  something else  with a great holiday menu the food is superb Our waiter Noah  really took care of us he gave us special  treats It l  worth every penny 5 stars."}
{"text":"There is no better restaurant in this town for a date. If she's mad at you take her to Café Monarch and get yourself off the couch.  If she's happy take to Café Monarch and make her ecstatic. If you are not sure how she feels about you, take her to Café Monarch and close the deal!"}
{"text":"Great BYOB.  The chef and owner was a spunky delight that created two beautiful dishes for our table.  The setting is such a treasure that you can't find anywhere else in old town.  Can't wait to go back for another wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Celebrated 10yr anniversary this past Friday. Had left a message earlier in the day and requested an outdoor seat. Unfortunately they could not accommodate and were told we could wait an hour for a table to open up. Wasn't going to happen so we gladly took our seat in the empty interior dining area.  The Good: Food and service were tremendous. Couldn't go wrong with the various course options and thoroughly enjoyed our food and bevies.   The Bad:  There is one shared toilet in the entire place. My wife and I had a few drinks elsewhere before dinner...huge mistake. My fist trip to the bathroom shortly after arriving was a 20 minute fiasco.  Some old Scottsdale bulimic was in there purging her foie gras. Shortly after I had voiced my concern to a manager, this surgically altered specimen (cross between a Siamese cat and a duck) emerges from the bathroom and passes by without a word. Line is several people deep at this point so I quickly rushed my business and ran back to the table. Now my wife had to go and there was still a line...I'll spare you the details, but unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber. Would rather have a port-a-potty outside to use than deal with that again.  Really broke up what could have been a special meal. Spending half the night waiting to tinkle instead of enjoying a candlelit experience with your loved one was a bummer.   Tip: Wear adult diapers or dehydrate yourself prior to arrival. Minus 2 stars for lacking facilities required to micturate."}
{"text":"Worth making a trip for.  If you're interested in food and enjoy chatting with the chef, this is amazing. The chef/waiter/maitre'd/everything is super calm, polite, and skilled.  The cafe ambience is very warm, the open kitchen makes you feel very much at home, the coffee is great (there's chicory root), and the food is superb."}
{"text":"My final Yelp review for 2016, boy what a year it has been!  We spent our NYE dinner at Monarch, a gorgeous restaurant in Scottsdale offering a set 4-course menu for $150/pp.  You get the soup and salad, and then choose from two 3rd courses and from four main courses.  Dessert not included and is extra.  Every dish I selected (including dessert) was superb and would have been solid 5-stars.  However, my wife's main course and dessert choice were both subpar (2-3 stars).  I'm averaging the two and bumping up my rating to 4 stars since I really liked the awesome service and ambiance.  As for the dinner:  * Kaboucha-Cauliflower soup was superb - the sweetness balanced by the saltiness of black truffle.  Awesome grilled bread to eat with the soup!  5 stars  * Winter Salad was a creative, multilayered salad with dual dressings.  It had some mild spiciness but I really liked the crunchiness of the corn vs the softness of the couscous.  You get flavors of bacon and chilis too. 5 stars  * Both 3rd course options were good - seared scallop with parsnip puree and a lamb lollipop that was super tender and slightly sweet.  A lollipop for sure! 5 stars for both.  * The main course had a divergence.  My filet mignon (medium rare) was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The whole poached lobster tail on top of it was likewise perfect, as were the roasted potatoes and other puree sides (5 stars).  My wife chose the chicken which turned out to be a mistake - overcooked, dry, and lacking flavor.  (2 stars).  * Dessert was another divergence.  Flourless Chocolate Cake was excellent - mostly sweet, some bitter to balance things out, and all moist! (5 stars).  The wife chose rum cake which was super sweet and had no detectable rum flavor at all - it was closer to a honey-soaked cake (2 stars).    Service was top-notch, and I think its possible to have a 5-star meal here by sticking to the filet and lobster and chocolate cake.    Never order chicken from a restaurant unless the chef owner's last name is Keller or if eating at Lalla Grill in Monterey, CA."}
{"text":"Wow, we were surprised and awed by the service, ambience, and food at Monarch Cafe. It is charming on the outside, but a little invisible in its tucked away spot in Old Town Scottsdale. Once inside, we were surprised at how wonderful it was. We sat outside in their romantic patio where every table feels special and uncrowded. The inside tables looked winderful too. The food and service were perfect. It's a special occasion place for us because of the cost, but it was worth every penny. Be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend for his birthday dinner. Absolutely the most perfect dinner in every aspect.. Romantic atmod, attentive service and incredible food. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Amazing Experience. Chris- the chef and owner was knowledgeable, funny, inviting, and accommodating. We were in for our law firm's Christmas Party. Chris made the whole experience wonderful. The soup, entree, salad, and dessert all tasted like they were made with love. I will be back.  This is a great place for date night or out of town guests with a hard to please taste.   Make reservations, this place is small and fills up nightly."}
{"text":"I am grateful to have stumbled upon this wonderful hidden Jim.  The food is exquisite and the grounds beautiful.  It's clear Chef Christopher has a gift that can't be found just anywhere.    With that I'd like to say thank you, Chef for sharing a little bit of yourself with me and the ones I love!  I wish you best wishes and look forward to visiting again next year.   Amber"}
{"text":"Not what it appears, unfortunately.  I have had business associates state the same about this restaurant.  The hostess and other workers (one in particular, name escapes me) were both unprofessional and as a result I will do my best to steer friends and clients from eating at Cafe Monarch going forward.  It's amazing what word of mouth can do to hurt a reputation.  Maybe management should discuss with staff the importance of a first impression."}
{"text":"We went here on a Wed night.  The menu is four courses, prix fixe.  The only choice to make was the main course.  A wine pairing is also offered.  Dinner was sublime--I don't know how else to describe it.  I loved the cold zucchini soup, the salad, the crab cakes and the dessert.  The wine was superbly paired and I was able to substitute white for the red--it was wonderful with the crab and it was also 109 in Phoenix.  Friends had the filet mignon --we exchanged bites--all was wonderful.  Dinner was $55 and wine $25--It was certainly very reasonable for the quality and the quantity. One more note--the restaurant is lovely --the surroundings are delightful and truly adds to the fact that you know after the first bite--that it is going to be a magical and wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Clearly one of the most pleasurable dining experiences we have had in years. Beautiful music under the lights on the patio set the mood for the evening. Service was consistent and excellent. Special requests were happily met. From the greeting by the hostess to leaving the restaurant we felt the Monarch staff went above and beyond at every step. Our highest recommendation to any seeking a restaurant where you will receive outstanding food, excellent service in a beautiful setting. A very memorable way to celebrate our anniversary. T"}
{"text":"Came here for Anniversary dinner with my wife. What a fantastic evening!  She is currently pregnant and neither of us has drank for the last 9 months so I can't comment on the cocktails or wine list sadly.  However the food and service were great.  Richard was amazing and knowledgeable.  He even comped our desert as a celebration of our anniversary and our new little one who will be here soon!   And when we said how good the agniloti was and we were sad we miss out on the Bolognese me brought us a little sample of the Bolognese (which was delicious...whoever makes the pasta knows what they are doing).   Courses came out on time and waters never empty.  Needs anticipated and fulfilled. Probably best service I've had in Phoenix.   The food:  first course.  Rock shrimp in a sweet sour chili sauce with cucumber, jalapeño and micro greens.  Clean, bright, well seasoned, balanced and perfectly cooked.  Cauliflower soup:  very flavorful and tasty with creamy smooth texture and a good garlic toast crouton. Only complaint was that the cauliflower flavor definitely go lost in all the rich creamy truffle flavor.  It was a great truffle soup but if you didn't tell me it was cauliflower I wouldn't have guessed.  Still really good though.    Second course:   Roasted beet salad.  Perfectly roasted beets, a smear of quality goat cheese, greens, agridolce cashews for crunch, a bit of honey, fresh greens and a balanced slightly sweet tart raspberry vinaigrette.  Definitely a well composed and executed salad  Third course:  crab cake.  Not bad.  Not greatest either.  Had bacon jam and corn purée with it.  It just ate sweet.  Sweet corn, sweet crab meat, sweet bacon jam.  Needed more Old Bay in crab cake, some heat or some citrus or both to balance it out. Hangar steak with butternut squash agnilloti, poblano crema and Pinot noir reduction.  Perfectly cooked steak, amazing agnilloti and balanced sauces that pulled it all together.  Great dish.   Fourth course:  seafood risotto.  Pretty good.  Lots of big plump fresh seafood all with the exception of one prawn perfectly cooked.  Risotto was good but not great.  Was on the verge of being over cooked and gummy but was ok.  Risotto also lacked a depth of seafood flavor, like it wasn't made with a seafood stock or the stock wasn't fully developed. Tomahawk pork chop was good.  Massive double chop cooked to a perfect medium.  Sauces were ok. Decent smoky flavor to the sauce.  The legume cassoulet and butternut squash kind of ended up being a muted/muddled component.  Not bad.  Not great.   We also did the octopus/chorizo add on. Two perfectly cooked octopus legs.  And I mean perfect!  Soft and tender but not mushy and not at all chewy.  Balanced heat and smoke with the pepper sauce and the chorizo.  Couldn't get it any better in Spain.  Spot in dish  Desert: flourless chocolate cake and vanilla bean ice cream with cream and fresh berries.  Rich decadent, full of flavor.  Great end to fantastic meal.    Overall definitely makes top 2 or 3 restaurants we've been too in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation to celebrate my anniversary a month and a half in advance.  Showed up on anniversary only to find no recollection of reservation.  Chef was arrogant and slow to accommodate.  He even went so far as to mention i would be lucky to eat his food.  We went elsewhere.  There are better places to spend money for excellent food in the Scottsdale area minus the attitude. I will not be patronizing his restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Romance!!! This place is with a doubt the place for a special night out. The food is divine to say the least. We had the filet (the best Ive ever had) & seafood risotto entrees- fantastic both in their own rights. Do not miss out on the rum cake dessert. We enjoyed champagne, a pinot noir, and one of the specialty cocktails. The ambiance is second to none.... the candles, the fire, the lanterns, the flowers and music... I could go on and on... Special thanks to our server Noah - so warm, welcoming and attentive.... the whole staff is superb!!"}
{"text":"Chef Christopher is not unlike a character crafted by (insert prolific author here). I wouldn't be surprised if his motto wasn't \"if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.\" Undoubtedly, he would wash dishes and bus tables if he could. The fact that he cannot control every second of the customer's experience is visibly painful.  The night's main course was salmon or chicken. Crippled by indecision, I finally landed on the boneless, skinless chicken, with a smear of asiago cheese, basil and garlic rolled in prosciutto. This coiled beauty lay napping in a pool of fresh corn polenta with aromatic tomato basil fennel sauce.  Cafe Monarch truly takes comfort food to the next level. My first bite was akin to stepping into a warm bath. Even the tap water tasted like home; a farm that I never grew up on. Truly honest, rustic food.  No visit to Cafe Monarch would be complete without a little chat from the Chef. He personally thanks every one of his customers for coming in and tucks away their comments and feedback for later analysis. The conversations are never disingenuous, but always intriguing. In between tiny sips of hibiscus tea from what appears to be a squat ceramic container that you store kitchen utensils in, he is quietly studying you and plotting his next meal."}
{"text":"Best filet mignon I've ever had.  Cafe Monarch is a small romantic spot in South Scottsdale.  Good for anniversaries and celebrations unless you are a serious baller.    The atmosphere is super romantic and chill.  Candles lit everywhere and a sweet courtyard.    Back to the amazing food.  It is a chef pre fixe 4 course menu.  And you get to pick the 4th.  The menu changes weekly so you probably won't get what I had.  When I went the first course was a butternut squash soup that was delicious.  It had a great flavor and toasted pumpkin seeds.  2nd course: Lobster cake.  I could have eaten 3 more of them.  Fresh, with a slightly spicy aioli.  Loved it.  3rd course: Caesar salad.  Basically a big piece of romaine lettuce with sauce, a crunchy slice of fried parmeasan cheese, and a piece of candied bacon.  YUM!!  4th course: Citrus Crusted Chilean Sea Bass.  Unbelievable flavor.  Fresh, moist, bright flavors.    I also had some of my wife's filet mignon.  It was covered in a brown sauce and mushrooms and cooked to perfection.  The steak melted in your mouth.  For dessert we had a butter rum cake that was divine and a cappuccino.  The service was also on point.  I doubled the tip it was so excellent.  I have no idea why it is listed as $$$.  The courses start at $65 per person and that doesn't include drinks or a tip.  This is definitely a $$$$ spot.  Whoever is listing it as 3 is trippin.   I highly recommend this place for a special occasion or any serious foodie to check out."}
{"text":"They get a one star because of mismanagement. The first time I came for lunch I was turned away, they said they were closed on Mondays, but had an open sign out front. The second time was today when I showed up a few minutes before 2 pm and they refused service because they close at 2 pm. I don't care who you are or how good your food is, it's bad on you when your customer service is that poor. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Everything tastes heavenly. For my first night & dinner in Phoenix I can't imagine any other restaurant being more pleasant & delightful. I highly recommend the braised ribs which easily fall apart with a fork & melt in your mouth. The atmosphere is in a tranquil nature setting in a butterfly garden all lit with candles & other special tiny lights."}
{"text":"The Monarch does not rank in my all time top three but it is definitely in my all time top ten. As a life long Chicagoan, I have been to my fair share of good restaurants but the Monarch stands out. It started with our waiter Richard and all the way through the parking valet. The service is absolutely impeccable. Dining in the patio is the perfect spot for that special occasion. Did I mention the food yet? My wife had the duck and I had the pork chops. I never ate so slow in my life. There was so much flavor in every bite that I wanted the meal to last.  If you are in Scottsdale, you must put the Monarch on your to eat list."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing; local food, with a patio that is simply charming! The menu is simple and the food outstanding! Christian, the owner, clearly loves what he does and appreciates his guests. Inside is beautiful but the patio takes it to a whole new level!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing!! Atmosphere was spot on! Or waiter was boarder line and there was a super loud birthday party (which obviously is not the restaurants fault) My dinner took a long  time to come out, which they made up for with a free glass of wine! This is a great great stop! A must..."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe my luck when a friend of mine received a gift card to Cafe Monarch and invited me as one of her guests; this place has been on my list to check out forever, but it's hard to treat yo'self to extra fancy meals when you're ballin' on a budget. Our party was greeted by no less than 6 staff members between the front door and the beautiful patio where we enjoyed our meal. The ambience was very romantic yet cozy, with globe lights strung across the whole patio and small lanterns on each table.  Because we had 4 with us, we decided to divide and conquer the menu, so we could try as many different things as we could. My first course choice was the Squash Blossom Relleno, oozing with melty cheese and poblano and deep fried, served with pickled onions and a black bean purée. All of the flavors paired perfectly, and the textural differences between the melting cheese and deep fried crunchy exterior was mind-numbing. My friends chose the Roasted Cauliflower Soup, which was also was fantastic. Just the right amount of truffle oil.  My second course choice was the Jumbo Lump Crab Salad, which was a crab cake with an adorable salad housed inside of a baby romaine heart to the side. It was the best crab cake I've ever had in my entire life (shh, don't tell my fella's parents, who hail from Baltimore and regularly throw crab fests). With huge lumps of crab, it was wonderfully seasoned and perfectly accompanied by the salad, which was served with a delightful vinaigrette. I would've happily eaten 20 more of them. My friends opted for the Pork Belly, which was surprisingly large. I thought that it was just the slightest bit overcooked, but it was still incredibly tasty.   I ended up going with the Hanger Steak for round 3, which was phenomenal. It was cooked to medium-rare perfection, served with asparagus slices, a béchamel, and pesto. It was the perfect final appetizer to get me stoked before the main course. My friends who chose the Yellowfin Crudo were obsessed with theirs as well. The tuna was incredible, served with aioli and atop a delightful rice cake; crispy on the outside, but the perfect chewy interior.  By the time the main course came around, we were all so excited that we could hardly keep control over our limbs. A real sucker for well-prepared Rack of Lamb, that was my fourth course choice. It was cooked phenomenally, and came with a huge serving. I'm very picky about my lamb, usually opting to only order it at French places, as that's how I've found I prefer it seasoned. So, while prepared very well and served with excellent pairings, the seasoning used here was not my favorite flavor in combination with lamb. That being said, I can't fault them for my own picky tastes. One friend went with the Bucatini, pasta with a variety of tasty sea creatures. The pasta was served with a cheesy cream sauce which complimented the seafood very well. The one small point I had against it was that the scallop was just a bit salty, though not too bad when paired with the noodles. My other friend had the Cast Iron Filet Mignon, which was to die for. I'm a big steak gal, and this was one of the best steaks I've ever encountered; the cast iron left the exterior of the steak wonderfully crispy, without drying out the interior at all. Each bite was like heaven, especially when paired with the scalloped potatoes (which happen to be my favorite way to consume potatoes--though let's be honest, there's no bad way). Our last friend had the Surf and Turf Trio which was in short, perfection. A smaller piece of filet mignon, served next to lobster ravioli and the Chilean sea bass. I only sampled the sea bass off her ate, but it was melt-in-your-mouth amazing. Needless to say, we were all bursting at the seams full with the completion of our fourth course.   Because we were also celebrating two birthdays in our party, the restaurant treated us to their most popular desserts, complete with sparklers and a small gift for the birthday gals. We had the flourless chocolate cake and the rum cake, both of which were amazing in their own accord. I lean a little more towards the rum cake, myself.  We had impeccable service throughout the entire evening, with people available at all times should we have any questions, and regular check-ins to confirm we were enjoying our meal. All of the food runners (they probably have a fancier title at such a fancy place) were very well informed about all of our dishes, providing detailed descriptions with each delivery. My water glass never even reached the halfway point before being refilled, and all the staff were all smiles throughout the evening. The stunning service I think is what truly put the meal over the top.   For anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion, or perhaps just looking to splurge on a fantastic meal, I highly recommend Cafe Monarch. Everything was spectacular from top to bottom, and it was a stellar experience throughout--and we'd know, we spent 2.5 hours here :)"}
{"text":"Chris is AMAZING! I shocked this guy normally handles the cooking, serving, greeting, etc. by himself.  The night we went, he had a waiter but that is because he had about 30 people in the place.  The food - two words, incredibly fresh.  We were lucky enough to sit at the bar by his kitchen and we got to watch him cook.  He has amazing organizational skills.  We started out with roasted peppers (garlic, rosemary, olive oil), arugula, proscittuo salad with toasted bread and freshly shred cheese.  There were three choices for the main course.  Chicken w/chimichurri sauce, salmon with capers, green onions in a white wine cream sauce and sliced filet mignon over chinese black rice.  The rice had green onions, italian sweet hot peppers and other spices in it.  He squeezed a fresh orange and orange zest over the steak and then surrounded it with thai chile sauce.  The combination of flavors were incredible.  Dessert was a napolean puff pastry with lemon cream, topped with tons of fresh blue and blackberries, fresh whipped cream, powdered sugar, etc.    Unfortunately, he was so busy that we didn't get to talk to him too much, which based on other reviews, was a highlight.   We will definitely go back.  This is a treat!  We've come back to San Diego and told all of our friends about it."}
{"text":"Good, not great. Way better places for not such a high price point. And really slow service from our waiter. My bf ordered a drink and I told him I needed another minute to decide...took him close to 10 min to come back. During that time, I could see him just standing around, but he never looked our way. We had told them it was an anniversary dinner, but it was poor service for a regular night out, much less a special occasion.  Food wise, the salad and soup were fantastic! But after that, everything was sub par.  We both highly preferred the food and service at Virtu down the road a few months prior when family was in town."}
{"text":"My wife has been wanting to try Cafe Monarch for a while, so I decided to surprise her for our anniversary. From the second we walked in the door, the service was outstanding. Everyone wished us a happy anniversary, which is a courtesy not afforded by most restaurants. Our server, Chris, was extremely knowledgeable and made our dining experience more than enjoyable. The food was absolutely amazing; not one complaint. All of the staff were very professional and attentive. One of the best dining experiences we have ever had."}
{"text":"This food was amazing! This was the best meal I have ever had omg so delicious! Chef Christopher has an amazing gift! I could taste every favor in the food and everything was homemade and cooked to perfection! Lunch was delicious! Dessert was amazing! I already made a appointment for next weekened!!! Highly recommend. Thank you so much Christopher! :)"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough about Monarch. Was a Google search for me to find out about.. I don't know how it is not listed in top 5 options in AZ. Maybe because the prices are reasonable. Either way, try this place for your next night out. Service to prefix menu was top notch. Possibly best Sea bass plate I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this cafe!  The atmosphere is close to perfect.  In fact, I lunched there today with a professional photographer, and she was so impressed, she asked Chris (Chef/Owner/Proprieter) if she could return for a photo shoot, to which he obliged.  The food was beautiful (as always), cooked to perfection (as always), and a wonderful new combination of foods (as I have come to expect).  I continue to tell everyone I know about this place!"}
{"text":"Impeccable service, delicious food, great ambiance, music selection, and decor. The courtyard patio is stunning and makes the place just in of itself. I celebrated my birthday here and really enjoyed their service. They even gave me some soup to-go because I commented on how much I enjoyed it by chance. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said! I went here for my birthday and it was such a nice and special occasion. Having Christopher cook for you and talk to you is such a unique dining experience and I wasn't disappointed.   However! I would have appreciated being told to have cash up front. Also, it got really smokey in the restaurant (it is so small) and everyone's eyes were tearing up towards the end of the meal.   I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch has a very quaint and romantic atmosphere.  The staff was very nice and attentive.  The food was delicious.    I have to admit,  I was disappointed when I found out that Cafe Monarch has changed owners.  I have heard many great things about this place and finally when I  checked it out, they told me about the change.  I was nervous how my experience would be with a different chef.  I am glad they still lived up to their expectation!  :)"}
{"text":"if you're looking for a place that is full of surprises, make sure to make a trip over to cafe monarch where the place has NO menu as the owner/chef/server/clown will surprise you where the sidewalk will never end...   cash only...  opened for lunch/dinner : wed-sun ONLY... dinner: ressies only.  *~**~*  dear christopher,  where do i begin? thank you so much for accomodating me and 2 of my friends very last minute ... i have to be honest with you, however ... it was 130pm when my friend called me and told me how you were about to close for dinner... i sat in my car, a bit speechless, thinking, are you serious? last i checked, cafe monarch was no japanese place... 140, me and my other friend get to your restaurant. 145 rolls around, and me and my 2 friends start scrambling around with our phones (thank god we have internet on our phones!) wondering where to eat ... 10 minutes after brainstorming, we decided to leave when a fine gentleman came out asking how many people it was for and welcoming us in.  we come in, and was greeted by a warm smile... asking us if we were allergic to anything, and all of the above.. i swear, if you didn't ask, this would've been a 4.5 experience ... only because i don't like goat cheese, but see? that's just my personal preference ... luckily, you had brie cheese, and oh yes siree, now where do i simply begin w/this 5 star experience? your breakfast salad? sandwich? artwork? or whatever you call it, was definitely a surprise. i cant believe how much i LOVED your food... not sure if you noticed but 2 of my friends were super hungry so within 3 minutes, their food was gone, but i was still nibbling on my 4th zucchini... your veggies and your turkey was superb! cooked with perfection...  not only was your food one of the best places ive tried in arizona alone but the experience was well worth it...  one thing to know about me is that i'm a huge planner, and when i go to places, i normally like to get a copy of the menu or skim over the menu if i can, but i think that's what made this place so much more enjoyable by having no menu... paying $13~15 and leaving with a big fat smile on my face has definitely left a memorable impression of a lifetime! i hope food network comes through your restaurant one of these days because at least i can say i was lucky enough to not try your cooking when it first opened but to say that i was even MORE lucky that i was able to try your \"dessert\" that you were going to prep for last night's dinner... o yes, the measuring cup to say the very least ...   christopher, again, thank you for taking us in and not to mention, the excellent food!!  yours very truly, jen  PS. i shall return : my next AZ trip"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I have never had a better meal!  Amazing service- Richard our main server was attentive, informative, personable, and spent a lot of time explaining things and answering our questions.  All of the staff members were on top of the service.  It is a 4 course pre-fixe menu with optional sides, desserts, wine pairing.  It is pricey- but a really nice way to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"I loved it! This place is so beautiful decor is beyond expectations. Amazing service! everyone was so nice."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how wonderful our experience was at Cafe Monarch. I had been looking forward to it for months. They noted it was our anniversary and provided complimentary mocktails (as we don't drink) which were so delicious, a complimentary appetizer, and dessert. The gourmet course prix fixe menu was beautiful. One of each item for us to share... Then the seafood risotto & the pork. The food was superb, the service was amazing. The atmosphere was very romantic. I can see why they were voted the #1 most romantic restaurant in the USA by Yelp. It was very worth the visit for our special engagement."}
{"text":"Warm ambience, very friendly and attentive service (Sam was great!), tasty and well-presented dishes. The cauliflower soup with truffle oil and the winter salad were phenomenal. The beef short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth tender and juicy. A little on the pricey side but well worth a trip on a special occasion. Definitely on the list to revisit next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"During a visit to Scottsdale we joined the few, the proud, the happy diners who have had a chance to experience Cafe Monarch! (Apologies to the USMC for co-opting their recruiting slogan.)   This venture is truly a labor of love for chef / owner Christopher whose passion for his endeavor shows in every detail from the ambiance to the food to the service.   Arriving a little early for our 6 pm reservations, we had a chance to speak with a couple of Christopher's friends who dropped by to see him.  We learned he created Cafe Monarch out of what was formerly a beauty salon. In fact, Christopher also shared that earlier in the week he had been working to replace an interior door and make some other changes. A never ending \"adventure\" of putting the stamp of character on Cafe Monarch.   Normally we might start a review with a discussion of the food we enjoyed, but the Cafe Monarch experience is so much centric to the persona of the owner that it might be best to start there. Christopher is a charming man with a convivial style.  Plus, he is a talented chef and does all the menu planning, shopping and cooking. No assistants or sous chef here. (In discussion with him, we learned we can thank his mom for his great cooking skills...in that he needed to learn to cook for self preservation!)   He is also an accomplished host who serves the meals and circulates during the evening to make certain that his guests, whether dining inside or outside, have what they need.   On the evening we arrived, there was pecan wood burning in two outdoor free standing fireplaces, offering a wonderful aroma and which would provide warmth of temperature and ambiance both for those who arrived and elected to dine outside as the evening evolved. We chose to sit inside where we could soak up the eclectic charm of the restaurant and enjoy watching Christopher at his craft in the kitchen. A nice couple from Washington state came in and sat alongside us and in enjoying an evening of delightful conversation with them, we all marveled at Christopher \"in action\".   Our dinner that evening started with a salmon appetizer that included thick (poached?) nuggets of fish served with a slice of grilled eggplant (unique combination and worked well) along with fresh herb pesto, capers and a slice of good, grilled crostini. We all agreed it was delicious and the serving size so generous we could have stopped there and been happy. But there was more to come in a choice of two entree selections, one was slices of pork served with a fresh mango salsa and citrus sauce and the other chicken paillard served on a bed of creamy polenta with cheese and surrounded by a lovely pool of tomato sauce. All of the seasonings were just right as was the temperature of the food at service. We finished the meal with a baked Bosc pear topped with wonderful warm chocolate sauce and puff pastry dusted with confectioners sugar.  As others have shared, there is no liquor license here, so you'll have a chance to bring your own bottle of wine (we love being able to do that and to be able to share it, as we could on this evening,with the couple next to us.) Bring cash as our understanding is Christopher does not take \"plastic\". To plan for the cash, we'll share that our dinner that evening, that we think included a $10 fee for corkage, was $98 or so, including tax, for two people.   On our next visit to Scottsdale, we hope to be able to have lunch at Cafe Monarch and sit outside to enjoy Christopher's hospitality and great food again.   A closing note for this review is to mention accessibility. We have a heightened awareness of that issue of late and also note that the NY Times has included accessibility comments for some time in their reviews,with a renewed focus after food critic Frank Bruni had a favorite dining companion start to use a wheelchair. While Cafe Monarch is on one level, there is a step up to the restaurant, all inside seating is at \"bar height\" chairs and the bathroom is not accessible for wheelchairs. As we enjoyed our evening at Cafe Monarch we thought of two friends who would love it, one an attorney and another an artist and gallery owner, but who use wheelchairs and would need to know in advance that although the Yelp tag says \"wheelchair accessible: yes\", the access here is limited."}
{"text":"Beautiful, remarkable, tasteful, classy are the few words that come to mind. I absolutely loved dinning at this restaurant.  The chic elegance is throughout the restaurant. Perfect for for celebrating special occasions. The ambiance is set with posh furniture, fashionable fabrics and beautiful classy French music in the the background. Truly romantic!  All the waiters are sharp in appearance and dashing in attitude and costumer service.   If you are looking for a classy , high end dinning experience, THIS is the place for you.  The food is exquisite, every course is attractively seductive to the eyes and your tastebuds.  I highly recommend this restaurant. It is simply excellent!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is everything I hoped, wished, and dreamed it to be.  The ambiance and setting are beautiful.  We were seated on the patio area and the night was lovely with the lights.  I would also like to mention they are able to enclose this wonderful area when it is too cold or raining.    The four course set menu was divine.  My boyfriend proposed to me at this beautiful place, and the entire night was magical and lovely.  In no small part due to the attentive and very knowledgeable staff.  We started with the cauliflower bisque and the clam chowder, which was heavenly.  Each course was a wonderful experience, and after the sea bass and perfect filet Mignon, he proposed.  They brought us champagne and dessert.  We had a lovely time!  Once we were leaving, we were serenaded by one of the staff that is also an opera singer!  He was amazing!   It was an absolutely beautiful night and we can't wait to experience it again. A perfect place to take the one you love."}
{"text":"amazing, delicious food and beautiful courtyard.  we will be talking about this meal and experience for a long time."}
{"text":"Having been blessed to enjoy many restaurants in many locations of the world, I am sitting here writing this & trying to remember if I have ever had a better meal or more enjoyable time...   This restaurant is Magnificent in every way!   The presentation of the food is exquisite.  Beautiful Gastronomic Art on a plate!   Flavors are delicious and complex.    Our server Bradley was extremely good & beyond accommodating.  He proudly described the food & made great recommendations.  Bradley told us about the owner... This he explained is the owner's first restaurant.  He told us how Gus & his family had thought about and planned out every detail.   The venue itself is in a way almost a throwback to another time... It is exquisite in every detail.  Very romantic, private and filled with a beautiful energy... So intimate and magical... it feels like a warm embrace!  What a delight to enjoy this special, charming jewel of a restaurant.   They offer a very reasonably priced 4 course prix fixe with a vegetarian option. We found a lovely wine for $58. Cain & Fable 373. For the price this wine is a great choice.   Our first course was a lovely soup. Cauliflower. It does have a crumbled bacon topping if you are you are vegetarian.  The soup was smooth & had several different flavors, which left us both wanting more. It was served very hot which my husband loves.  I like it a little cooler, so it was perfect for both of us as I allowed it to cool on the spoon.    Second course we selected the prawn. Tempura with a beautiful presentation. Laying on a bed of something vegetable, again exquisite pairing of ingredients... Delicious!   Third course was THE SALAD.  Colorful, Beautifully placed on the plate... A taste blast of  two colors of roasted & then chilled beets, pomegranate, jicama, crisp lettuces.  Salad Perfection!    Fourth course Filet Mignon.  Cooked and seasoned to Absolute perfection. It is a nice large portion with a square of an au gratin potato. This PRIME PRIME PRIME filet melts in your mouth.    The Add On... Foie Gras.  Hudson Valley. Sweet, crispy, PERFECT.  The Best we have ever tasted.  Seriously Spectacular.   Somewhere along the line our server Bradley brought out a scallop side dish for us to taste.  Perfectly cooked, crisp, flavorful. Gordon Ramsey would give it a 100 score.    As it was my husband's birthday.  The chef sent out a complimentary sparkler topped dessert.  Amazing Chocolate Flowerless Cake with Vanilla Bean Gelato.  We both loved it.   To make the night even more delightful Gus, the Chef & Owner, came out & wished my wonder-guy happy birthday.  He was warm, charming, unpretentious, everything his restaurant is. He is a delightful person and an out of this world talented chef.   Call for a reservation... Hope you can get in!  I predict Cafe Monarch will be a Michelin 3 Star ... Top Award Winner very soon!!!   Yelp needs to add an extra star!  It is not even fair to expect great restaurants to compete with Cafe Monarch.  It is Once In A Lifetime Fabulous!"}
{"text":"There is nothing bad I can say about my experience here. Their mint and cucumber infused water is a great start to a 5 course meal that leaves nothing to be desired. Make sure you come here hungry. Even thing the portions are appropriately sized it's still a lot of delicious food.   The atmosphere is very intimate especially if you sit outside. Vines, candles, and string lights make this a truly romantic experience.   They moved across the street from the original location due to structural issues, but the new building is just as cozy.   They have retained the old location and use it for functions and complimentary valet parking for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Incredible food/experience.  Reading all the reviews prior to going I was a little skeptical that my expectations would be reached.  No issues with that.  Christopher was amazing.....cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am just confirming what everybody else wrote about this place.  Just tried it for the first time tonight.  What a wonderful experience.  Everything was very fresh and very tasty.  We will be back in two weeks (already made reservation)."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Cafe Monarch. When people ask me for recommendations for a date night or special occasion- THIS is the best of the best and always #1. While it is pricey, I completely believe it is worth it. Their set menu changes daily, their cocktails are unique and fresh, and their quaint patio is just adorable, fully equipped with bird houses, candles, and flowers.   Their nightly menu is typically 4 courses and you pick your main between 2 options, the other courses are set. They usually do give you the option to add-on a special treat for extra $ like lobster, scallops, etc. Their wine list is great and the dishes are bursting with flavor. I can honestly say that i've never had a bad experience at Cafe Monarch. I HIGHLY suggest going during patio season because you just can't beat the romantic ambiance outside, but inside is beautiful too!   We'll be back soon if my husband knows what is good for him! ;) hahah"}
{"text":"This is it. This is truly it if you're looking for the best dining experience in the valley. I won't even try to look for the words to accurately capture just how blown away we were by this place. My parent's beat us here and had dined a few times prior to us and paid for our entire meal just so we could experience it. It is not a cheap night out, but it will be one of your most memorable -- I can't emphasize that enough. From the moment we arrived and passed our keys along to the mandatory valet, to the time we walked back out to have valet recognize our faces well enough to go fetch our car without us even handing them our ticket, it was astounding. The service was impeccable. The menu was perfection. The quality of the ingredients were jaw dropping. The ambiance was like being in a totally different world (couldn't believe we were still in downtown Scottsdale given how gorgeous and private the courtyard was). I can go on forever, but please, don't spend even close to the amount of time I spent writing this thinking about whether or not to go -- GO!!!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at over 100 restaurants in town and this is by far the best all around. Not for children and maybe not for a group of businessmen but by far the best for couples."}
{"text":"WOW!!! This is the most beautiful fun and romantic restaurant!! We came here to celebrate our Anniversary after hearing the reviews for this wonderful place! Everything was just perfect from the minute we walked into the restaurant.. The flowers and the decor.. the awesome staff from the hostess to the wait staff.  The food was delicious and we can't wait to come back!! How can we say thank you thank you thank you to Richard for the amazing service, great hospitality and fun personality!! We highly recommend you ask to sit in Richard's section for the full experience!! Thanks again for making our night AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"We were SO disappointed .. Tonight was our 40th & we were in Scottsdale & everyone recommended Cafe Monarch.. Tables too close.. A real\"routine\" .. Our amuse buche was  deposited.. No wine.. No sign of wine.. Its all a process & we are not into process for a foodie dinner. We left before any more process occurred.."}
{"text":"Delicious and great atmosphere. Very romantic but still maintains a casual feel when eating. I took my girlfriend here for a surprise dinner and I'd say it was worth it. Food was on point. It's a small menu so it wasn't hard to decide what we wanted. We managed to try almost everything since they offer a few varieties for the first courses.  We didn't pair our meal with wine or dessert, but next time we'll try it."}
{"text":"The hype is well deserved.  This really was as close to a perfect dining experience as I've had in awhile.  Sure its pricey, but I knew that going in and the experience was completely worth it.  I actually took my Mom here for dinner on a brutally hot summer evening.  She originally wanted to go somewhere else fancy but after reading up on this place on Yelp and seeing the Check Please AZ segment, I steered her in this direction.  Boy am I glad that I did.  This place is set in an otherwise nondescript part of Downtown Scottsdale near the southwest corner of Goldwater and Indian School.  When you drive up to the premises, you see a long but narrow building and the hostess waiting right at the front door.  I got a little confused about where to go as they no longer have the dining room in the kitchen area, but rather on the north side of the building.  The setup of the interior is just as other Yelpers have described.  Beautiful, quaint, intimate.  There's a beautiful courtyard in back with dining tables as well but it was far too hot to dine outside tonight.  No worries though, we had a great view of the outside from our table.  The biggest surprise to me was actually how casual the dress was.  The men I saw were all in polos and khakis while the women were in casual summer dresses.  Not nearly as dressy as I expected.    The menu here changes weekly and there are very few choices you get to make.  Its a four course menu with an amuse bouche (basically a light snack) to start, then an appetizer, then you choose between one of three entrees, and then a dessert.  The amuse bouche tonight was a grilled zucchini soup with goat cheese and a crostini.  Fantastic start to the meal as the soup was cold, light, and the crostini was incredibly flavorful despite its relatively small size.  Dipping it in the soup was the best part.  The appetizer was a romaine salad with a smoked tomato dressing and various shaved veggies including carrots, radish and beets, topped off with some feta.  You definitely pick up the smoky flavor of the dressing, but the feta smooths it out and the salad portion was actually very generous.  Then came the main course.  I chose the ribeye with beef jus, corn puree, and baby spinach.  My Mom went with the crab cakes with eggplant and tomato.  Not to brag, but my dish was the best.  The ribeye meat was so tender I could've cut it with a spoon.  The puree and jus were a perfect topping to a steak that literally tasted like butter in my mouth.  I had some of my Mom's crab cake too and it was very good, though even she agreed my ribeye dish was superior.  In addition to the main course, there was an add-on we chose to share.  It was a Vietnamese-style shrimp with green papaya.  We each had two pieces.  The spicyness of it caught us both by surprise, but not so spicy that it took away from the flavor or the enjoyment.  Finally for dessert we each got a Coconut Tres Leches cake with blackberries and a lime chocolate sauce.  Super moist cake and the sauce was excellent.  The coconut might've been a little watery, but otherwise a great way to cap off an epic meal.  For drinks we did the wine pairing with the dinner.  We got a white wine for our first two courses, and a red for the last two.  I especially loved the Pinot Noir that we got with the main entree.  Smooth, rich, and paired perfectly with the ribeye.  In addition, I checked in on Yelp and that allowed my Mom to get a free glass of house wine to help her cap things off.   Alright, the price.  Like I said, not cheap.  We're talking special occasion only.  Total for two four course meals (plus wine pairings), plus the shrimp add-on, tax, and tip was about $250.  My Mom was nice enough to split the bill with me on this go-round.  And in all fairness, we went all out.  If you come here and just get the four course dinner, water, and no add-ons, you'll probably pay closer to $70/person.  That said, the add-on dish and wine pairings were totally worth it in my opinion.  Made the experience that much better.  The staff is extremely friendly, accommodating, and professional and were very knowledgable about every product we were served right down to the vintage of the wines.  Here's another fun fact about this place.  They have the nicest restroom I've ever seen.  Seriously.  Ever.  Its immaculate and exquisitely decorated.  Nicer than any restroom at anyone's house I've been to.  My Mom even said as much.  It would be hard to compare this place to Binkley's because its apples vs oranges.  But the quality of the food, first class service, and quasi-casual feel of Cafe Monarch is certainly comparable with Binkley's.  It's mainly just a difference in style and presentation.  But as I write this, Cafe Monarch is by far the best restaurant experience I've had in Scottsdale to date."}
{"text":"We have been visiting Scottsdale every year for about the past 8-9 years to celebrate our anniversary. We have always looked forward to a special dinner at Binkleys in Cave Creek. What to do this year with Binkleys closed?  I'm so thankful I found Cafe Monarch!  Of course the beautiful outside courtyard made the night start off on a great note.  I mentioned in making my reservation that we were celebrating and it was obvious that the staff paid attention.  From the greeting at the door to the quiet table in the corner and the unexpected dessert served at the end of the meal our anniversary was part of the service.  And the meal--- wow. Delicious. Every course was perfectly prepared and had layers of flavors. That salad?!  Package it up and let me take it home!  So tasty.  When you order a prixe fix meal sometimes you worry the servings may be skimpy.  Not at Cafe Monarch. Every course satisfied your taste buds, filled you up without making you feel over stuffed.  We may have missed our annual trip to Cave Creek but we were so very happy with our visit to the Arts district!"}
{"text":"I loved this place.  I was a little hesitant about the concept, but I had a great time. My mom and older daughter were visiting from out of town.  My mom usually doesn't have dinner out because she eats so little. So when my daughter was visiting from LA we told her we were going there and that she didn't need to eat all, just whatever she wanted.  Well, let me tell you, grandma ate everything that was put in front of her,  even had the frog legs Chris served us as our starter. My daughter works production on TV in LA and she commented to Chris that he should be on Top Chef.  Can't wait to be back for another experience."}
{"text":"Every meal I've had here is consistently excellent. It is the second best dining experience I've had, second only to Le Cinq (a three Michelin star restaurant in Paris). My wine is supremely paired, and even changed out as I abhor all Chardonnay's. Even in the depths of oppressive Phoenician July heat, their patio is comfortable and highly attractive to look at."}
{"text":"Yuuuuuummmmmyyyyyy! I love Café Monarch!  We went there for our anniversary last Friday and I was very excited to see what Chef Christopher would come up with for dinner.  My bf gave them a heads up that I was a vegetarian, but other than that, the entire meal was a surprise.  It was exciting because we didn't get menus, we just sat down with our bottle of wine and were asked if we were ready for our first course. That's a good indication of what's to come if the chef if is that confident in his food that he assumes you will like what's on the menu... and we DID!  We started with a grilled pear, brie and walnut salad served with a cranberry citrus vinaigrette, the flavors were excellent, it was something I've never paired together.  For our entrée I had a bean sprout patty topped with grilled eggplant and a mushroom sauce. The sauce was amazing!  I am actually going to try to make it myself this week.   I'm not a huge fan of bean sprouts, so if I would have seen a menu, I probably wouldn't have ordered it, but then would have missed out on some fabulous flavors!  So, I guess I do like bean sprouts =).   We sat out on the patio, which was candle lit and cozy.  I think sitting inside would have been a fun experience too, but less romantic.  Inside has a few tables and a small completely open kitchen.  It reminds going to a neighbor's house for dinner and watching him cook.  The whole dining experience is very inviting, and the food is unique and excellent.   We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. The food was amazing, and the service was impeccable! We were in for a long weekend from Chicago, and went based solely on reviews. Cafe Monarch did not disappoint, and was the highlight of an absolutely wonderful weekend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled upon this gem- one of the best dining experiences ever.  Food was simply fantastic."}
{"text":"I recently attended a private party at this restaurant.  Not only was the food extraordinary, the chef is outstanding.  He lovingly prepared dish after dish after dish of culinary delights!!  The ambiance is small, intimate and comfortable.  The price (well, it was free but still) as I understand it, was very reasonalbe.  This place is a gem!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything we imagined and more. What a homey place to eat and chat and feel at home while away from the massive snow storm 2009 in DC."}
{"text":"Came here because it was at the top of the yelp search. OMG what an awesome experience, had the three lunch course, and had to get two different types of cocktail, smoke and mirrors, and fig something. Delicious. We were a party of 5 and everybody was raving about ambience, service, food and drinks. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The four course prix fixe was flawless and delicious as to quality and presentation and our server was informative and responsive.  I was disappointed in the ambiance as the tables were small and very close together and it was rather noisy.  Not what I expected for a special night out with my wife.  I would rate it as a 4 of out 5.  It would have been a solid 5 in my estimation had there not been the ambiance issues."}
{"text":"This is strictly a review based off the lunch menu.... Went here for lunch on a Tuesday and it wasn't overly busy, but lunch service took an hour and a half!! The best part of lunch was the tomato soup with mini grilled cheese bite.  Based off the recommendation of the waiter, I ordered the surf & turf tacos. These tacos were something a preschooler could throw together. Save yourself from disappointment and order the roasted beef tips...SOOO good! I had major food envy, but it is my own fault for listening to someone else's recommendation. Seriously, I don't understand why those tacos are even on the menu. Maybe our waiter forgot to put in our order and they had to throw it together in 3 seconds? I don't know but for such great reviews I left hungry and mad. At least they discounted our check for taking so long..."}
{"text":"This is one of those rare places that does not feel real. I'm not saying you'll sit down and all of a sudden you will think we're all in \"The Matrix,\" or you'll walk to your table and a camera crew will ambush you because they are in the middle of filming \"Cafe Monarch: Electric Boogaloo.\" It's kind of a hard feeling to explain, really. Suffice it to say, when you're at Cafe Monarch, you almost feel like you're somewhere completely removed from the rest of the world. Yeah, it's an upscale restaurant surrounded by a neighborhood, and they are packed every night, but there is something one-of-a-kind about this place that makes each and every visit one to treasure.  My folks actually ended up here a year ago and placed it in their list of favorite dining experiences ever. So when they returned to Arizona again this year, I made sure to invite myself and see what all the fuss was about.  The most important thing I can suggest is come prepared with a reservation, preferably for the patio grotto. The second most important thing I can suggest is come hungry, because this is a multi-course meal where you basically sit back and let the chef dazzle your tastebuds. You may think something on the menu sounds odd or unfamiliar, but trust me: as soon as you shove it in your mouth, you'll be flabbergasted with flavor.  So the three of us arrive, and the valet comes over and ferries the car away. The outdoor hostess stand was cool, and the team working the desk was made up of very welcoming and friendly hostesses. In fact, my first impression was that this place has so much charm, it may even make me look like a functioning member of society. When we were guided to our seat outside, we passed through a few dining rooms and got to see all kinds of homely touches that let you know this place has never met a stranger.  Outside was just as impressive as my folks made it out to be. Tables and chairs expand in every direction under lights, enclosed by foliage and enough atmosphere to make you question if you are still in Arizona. On appearances alone, Monarch impresses.  But on quality of food and service? Monarch exceeds any and all expectations, doing its own thing and doing it phenomenally. Absolutely every person who came to our table was professional, cordial and quick with the refills. And on that note, I would like to give a sincere round of applause to the bartenders here - the cocktails here are practically works of art, capable of leaving you emotionally stimulated and inspired for any number of activities, whether that's ordering a third round or singing along with the jazzy soundtrack they have piped in throughout the place.  Food is on a whole other level. It was last Friday we were here and I've forgotten practically everything I ate; however, even in the absence of culinary memories, I can safely say everything here is going to knock your socks off. The crab cakes were delicious, the pork belly and salad both raced into my mouth as quickly as I could move my fork, the pork chop was (no joke) the best I have ever had, and I seem to recall the dessert was good, even though at that point I was in a food coma, having an out of body experience and trying to photobomb the table next to us.  If there is one nitpick to have with Cafe Monarch, it's the bathroom. The bathroom itself is gorgeous, probably the nicest one I have ever been in. Plus, there's a random chair in there for... I'm not sure what. But the problem is there's only one bathroom. Unless there is another one somewhere that no one told the six-deep line of us about. It's a very, very minor thing to make note of, but if you are sitting there at your table between courses four and five and you know you're going to need to excuse yourself, you may want to give yourself more time than you think.  But again, that's a minor observation that comes with the territory of an old family home, and certainly nothing to get worked up about. The fact of the matter is Cafe Monarch is definitely in the top 10 dining experiences I have had. The staff is outstanding, the food is impossibly delicious and the entire visit was one that you could not get anywhere else. Don't take my review for it, though: hop on OpenTable and book your table, and then eat a light lunch that day. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"This place is awesome !! They made our anniversary/ Valentine's Day perfect and magical.  We were seated right away and greeted and told happy Anniversery. Shown to our table which was on the patio and so romantic.  Offered water right away with choice of bottled or house water with hint of cucumber. Given our menus. Our waiter Chris cane to table and explained every item on menu. Also told us the reason for changing menu is so chef can use freshest ingredients. First course we both had  Manila Clam Chowder.   Which was beyond excellent.                 Had a little bit of spice which made it, to my        taste buds anyway. The best I have ever had. Next-  Wintersalad.  -  salad was fantastic also.   Tempura King Tiger Prawn - sweet and spicy   Chilean Sea Bass- melted in your mouth   Anniversery Dessert-  Strawberry Cheesecake   Everyone was attentive. Soft music. Candlelight. Roses on each table.   Bill came. And yes it was high. But it was worth it. We could not afford to eat here more then once a year. But if you have a special occasion coming up. This place can't be beat. My husband and I go to a special restaurant every year for our anniversary and this was by far the best.  Thank you for a memorable night staff of Cafe Monarch !!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here to celebrate my college graduation. It was a really fun and special night. I opted to have the tuna tartare and gnocchi apps instead of a full meal and I was not disappointed. We also split a burrata and had a house cordial. They also make their own alcohol which is so fun! We dined on the romantic patio that was lined with bushes and twinkle lights. The waiter was friendly and made great suggestions, even bringing us some samples. Fun night and I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Finally, I was able to try Cafe Monarch. I've been wanting to go there for years! There was a group of 6 of us and we had made our reservation over a month in advance with a request for the patio, but it was inside seating for us. I was kinda bummed because we had heard so much about the patio, but our table was nice and felt like our own little dining room. Our food was delicious-- especially the salmon with squid ink risotto-- everyone that had that cleaned their plates. Dessert was a simple strawberry shortcake type thing, that was SO perfectly sweet and fluffy.  Love the simplicity of the very few options-- you know if they are only making a few things they are doing it right. We had a vegetarian and a gluten-free diner with us and the kitchen impressed them both by creating dishes for them that they could enjoy. Our server on the other hand was totally confused by the dietary needs and continually forget that they had them. He gave a poor representation of what was going on back in the kitchen! We did the wine pairing and he didn't bring the wine in time to drink with the food it was supposed to be paired with (every time). He couldn't remember what was in the dishes-- it was almost painful, we helped him by looking at our menus and reading them for him.   We'll go back for sure, but it IS hard to want to sign up for the same type of service experience-- I hope they can work on that because the food is money."}
{"text":"We come to Scottsdale once a year.  We discovered Cafe Monarch 2 years ago  when they were in the old building.   This was our most eagerly anticipated meal!   No one was disappointed.  The food was fabulous!  Each course was perfect.    I could only give 4 stars and debated about giving only 3 stars.   We were a large party dining for dinner at the later seating. We had a delicious meal with a hefty bill...I only wish the service had been as good.    For a restaurant of this caliber,  we expected much better service.    Little things like having to \"ask\" for more water to our table being cleared as we were finishing desert.  (As I said we were the later seating and the restaurant was still quite full.   In other words, we did not overstay.  In fact, it felt like we were pushed out). Considering the cost of dining here, this was simply unacceptable.     If they did not want a large party, they should not have taken our reservation.    Needless to say, we won't be returning as there are plenty of great options in the area that are the whole package..food, atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience. Great service and a wonderful atmosphere. Life is made of our experiences and I'm glad that this one found its way into my life. This was a night my wife and I will never forget."}
{"text":"We have been to several great eateries in the area and this tops them all. Of all the restaurants in Scottsdale none deserves a Michelin star or two more than this place does. The ambiance is elegant and romantic, especially the outdoor courtyard covered with bistro lighting, candles, and the sound of running water. This is easily the most romantic dining area I have seen in the Phoenix area.  The food is simply exceptional. I wish I had the palate to describe the flavors, but suffice it to say that they are both complex and delicious. They choose ingenious combinations which are which are bursting with flavor. And it isn't every day that you find morels on the menu.   Our dinner was served over four courses with a Yellow Tomato Gaspacho to start followed by Compressed Melon Salad. The Gaspacho was light and creamy and the salmon was so perfectly cooked that my fiancee actually ate the skin. The melon salad was just enough to keep you wanting more and the combination of flavors was out of this world.  I started with a Brooklyn cocktail and my fiancee had a glass of Sancerre. They give you plenty of time to savor the food, the ambiance, and the conversation. We later paired a Bourdeaux with the filets we both ordered.   Our waiter, Wesam, is a certified sommelier and he was excited to teach us all about the wine we were drinking, and some that we weren't. He even hand wrote a list of documentaries and films about wine that we should watch. He had the kind of knowledge about wine that only comes through both passion and experience. We will request Wesam every time we visit in the future!  The third course was a choice of between Crispy Skin Branzino and Spanish Octopus Puttanesca. We ordered one of each, I took the octopus which neither of us normally like much. We trusted the chef though, and as expected the octopus was delicious. Again, I wish I had the palate and language to describe how exquisite the flavor combinations were on both of these very different dishes.   Finally, we both ordered the the Cast Iron Seared Filet Mignon. Now, I won't say that this was the best cut of steak I have ever had because it was not. But again, the combination of flavors was superb. The chef dressed things well and the morels with filet makes for a divine combination.  Dessert was probably my least favorite part of the meal. We had the rum cake and it was sort of a typical dessert. Don't get me wrong if you are actually still reading this. It was good, but not up to the standard of the rest of the meal in my personal opinion. But dessert isn't the focus of this restaurant.   I wouldn't recommend a first date here, but if you really want to impress someone special, you are both foodies, and you can talk for hours, then this is your place. There is probably nowhere more romantic in the Phoenix area than the courtyard at Cafe Monarch and the food and ambiance will make for a very memorable evening."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for our 2nd year anniversary. This is by far the most intimate and romantic restaurant that I've been to with phenomenal food and exceptionally great service. They have set 4 course meal menus that go for $55 per person that changes every few days. For two people you are looking at $180-200 with tips and drinks. Very pricy but for special occasions like this, well worth your money."}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch is romantic, quaint, charming, and quirky...a nice change of place and pace in Scottsdale. The chef, Chris, cooks with love and artistry from the moment he greets you to the moment he serves you. My salmon dish was prepared perfectly (I told him I wanted something healthy) with a blend of mixed vegetables. It just wasn't the meal itself that was good, but the presentation and portion of my meal. Too bad I didn't have my camera with me, but it was beautiful. He then surprised me with a small slice of bread pudding for dessert soaked in (vanilla?) cream sauce. Is he a mind reader, too? Bread pudding is one of my favorite desserts.  The one thing that makes this place so unique is that there's only one chef and maybe another server to help him out. Remember, patience is a virtue. Don't expect a large menu, though, because there isn't one. Simply displayed on a chalkboard are a few items you can choose from for lunch. I will definitely be back to enjoy his brunch.  Oh! And for those of you not in the know. I love (addicted) to coffee and I kid you not...my coffee mug was never empty. Chris kept that baby and my caffeine levels loaded. Maybe I should marry this guy?"}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for my 24th birthday in September (yes, this review is a little late) and I will have to say that the food was very well prepared and presented. Additionally, the ambiance of the restaurant creates a \"at home\" feeling. Even beyond the food and the environment was Christopher's excellent customer service. He came and talked with us for about 10 minutes and was extremely friendly...and it wasn't just \"oh hey the weather is nice\" conversation, it was genuine and unexpected. One factor that I recognize and appreciate more than good food is customer service. This place has everything you can desire in a restaurant."}
{"text":"To give a brief update/clarification on my previous negative review (which I still completely stand behind) - and the reply from the Manager there. Yes, we did have a reservation, in my boyfriends name. I messaged the manager back privately and haven't heard a peep since. Seems they only try to save face on something public vs actually trying to fix the problem with the upset customer.  Previous Review:  It is with great sadness that I give Monarch a 1 star review.  I have come here several times over the last few years and the food has been very good until my last visit where I got horrible food poisoning. It was absolute hell for a full 2 days after. I won't go into more details.  I'm not just writing a 1 star review because the establishment got me ill from their food (although frankly, that should be enough). I'm also writing this review because of the bad reservation policy and service.   Every single time I have come here, I've had a reservation, and EVERY SINGLE TIME I have had to wait for my table or simply not been seated where I wanted. In the winter, you want to be outside on their beautiful terrance, not cooped up inside, and yep you have to wait for AGES that its not even worth it because you are so hungry that you end up sitting inside.   On the flip side, in the summer you don't want to dine in 110 degree heat so you want to be inside. Whenever you go, you won't get seated where you want. They claim to \"reserve you a table at the restaurant, not an indoor or outdoor specific place\" what is the point of this? The entire point of a reservation is to sit where you want. We made reservations on our anniversary and had to wait OUTSIDE in the HEAT (August in AZ is not kind) for 45 minutes for a table. What the actual hell is that about. Terrible management of the establishment and then to add insult to injury I got sick from the food.   I will not be returning here, and I don't think anyone else should either. Reservation problems can ruin a special occasion and no one wants to get sick."}
{"text":"I came here for my bday.  I was so exited.  Thinking they put staff through server training classes this is gonna be good.  Most high end restaurant food is good service terrible.  We made a reservation a week ahead.  Had to wait at the bar over 30 mins on my bday for my table which was booked a week ahead.  Service was terrible not impressed with the food.  They brought out a few wrong orders.  Both of our seabass was over cooked taste more like chicken it was so over cooked.  I said something they didn't even take it off the bill.  Service was so rushed stressed out.  Running fast like a chicken with their head cut off.  Beautiful inside.  Bad food bad service.  Ruin my bday dinner."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a conference and Yelp led me to this lovely establishment.  I set a reservation for 5:30 on a Thursday night.  Chris asked if I had any allergies or foods that I didn't like. You care?  Awww.... My only request was no beets. He also asked if I had any time constraints. At least give yourself an hour here.   I ended up running late, but Chris assured me it was no problem.  I arrived and was kindly greeted by Chris and his staff of 2 (one of which was a trainee).  I chose to sit inside so I could see him cook.  The inside is small, intimate and quaint. The cooking area is off to side, but in a location where most diners can see Chris in action.    The first course was shredded cucumber noodles with chopped roma tomatoes, grated asiago cheese atop 2 toasted slices of baguette with olive oil.  The cucumber threw me off a little, but everything tasted fantastic together! The perfect blending of ingredients.  I probably coulda eaten another serving but thank goodness I didn't.  The second course was Shrimp cakes with green beans, black rice with carrots, purple cabbage, and zucchini, served with a sweet chili sauce.  There was a little kick on the finishing bites of the shrimp cakes. Nothing unbearable.  I wasn't a big fan of the green beans. But they were just plain.  The shrimp cakes with the black rice were wonderful. I got pretty full from the shrimp cake, but shamelessly finished the entire portion. The final course, dessert, was pumpkin bread pudding topped with glazed pear and toasted nuts with cranberry sauce on the side and a sprig of mint.  This portion was HUGE! I think I maybe took about 4 bites and just couldn't eat anymore. The dessert was delicious and I especially liked the glazed pear topping.  The food tasted very fresh. Chris mentioned that he had gone to the market earlier that day to prepare for dinner.    Service - The staff, to include Chris, was very attentive. About mid way through my dinner, 2 more couples arrived and decided to sit outside. A few minutes after the waitress seated them, Chris asked the waitress, \"Is everybody comfortable?\"  Really?!  If ain't customer service, then I don't know what is. Oh wait, yes I do. So I've paid my bill (only cash accepted; think it was around $65) and I stand up to leave. I walk over to Chris to thank him for a wonderful dining experience and ask if I can take his picture. He graciously obliges and takes a pic with me. After the pictures, I walk out the door and who should follow? Chris! He walked me to my car and even opened my door. If THAT'S not customer service, then I dunno what is!  I can't say enough about this little gem. I only wish Chris could split his time between AZ and DC. At least think about it, Chris?? :-p  I  If you ever find yourself near Scottsdale, make some time for Cafe Monarch. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner here!  If you are in Scottsdale you must visit.  I am a vegetarian and typically am not enthused by the vegetarian options at most restaurants, particularly for the entree.....however, Cafe Monarch had phenomenal vegetarian options!  I visited this past week and they had an amazing butternut squash soup, excellent salad and then for me the best part was one of the best entrees I've ever had! Polenta lasagna with portobello, spinach, tomato jam and delicious, fresh mozzarella....then when I didn't think it could get any better, the DESSERT was INCREDIBLE!!  Rum cake with salted caramel gelato....AWESOME.  Keep up the amazing work, Cafe Monarch! I hope to return to Scottsdale soon so I can visit again."}
{"text":"We are from Chicago and came to Scottsdale for my birthday and decided to dine at Cafe Monarch and we were not disappointed, the service was emaculate  We we're seated right away and our server was very attentive and knowledgeable with the food and wine pairings and spoke not only about the individual wines but the back story on them too which we thoroughly enjoyed, my girlfriend loved the Azur pairing with her salad. All four courses were delicious! My favorite was the samosa and gnocchi but everything was great!   The ambiance was cozy and romantic, a great date night spot! Would highly recommend this place to foodies and anyone who wants an enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem and is set up like a fairy tale. Seating on the patio is a must and one is surrounded with candles and green flora. We had the fixed price menu but they do offer bruschetta and brunch which I'm dying to try. Our meal started with a pear and brie on arugula salad which was perfect. The brie had a little toasting to it which was a nice touch. Then for the main course we had the filet and salmon, both cooked to perfection. Dessert was a nice puff pastry. But what made the experience even more amazing was the service. At the end of our meal we were greeted by the owner, Christian, who was very personable and friendly. He gave us a tour of his kitchen which was adorable. Our waiter, Jeff, chatted with us for a while about travel and food which was awesome. He also recommended Mabel's on Main afterward and we ended our evening on a wonderful high. I would absolutely recommend Cafe Monarch for anyone looking to fall in love or rekindle some passion!"}
{"text":"I don't think I could give this place enough praise. From the moment we passed through the doors until 2 days later we were in awe. IT WAS THE BEST DINING EXPERIENCE OF OUR LIVES. On vacation, we yelped and found this place. The food was Devine. The service was beyond measure and the atmosphere was in a word.... Perfect.  It was the crowning moment in an already perfect trip.  Please visit this restaurant. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Genuinely one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. My wife and I go here for special occasions and it's always spectacular."}
{"text":"Another 5 star experience at this amazing little gem of a restaurant!  I brought my team here for dinner during our meeting in Old Town Scottsdale.  I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner of cauliflower soup, spicy tiger prawn, caesar salad, filet and rum cake & flourless chocolate cake - seriously amazing!  The patio is so romantic, the service is top notch and the food is just incredible!"}
{"text":"Perfect evening for my sister's bday! The service and food is amazing! Perfect place for special occasions and date nights! Love the atmosphere here. Thanks to everyone who made the evening memorable!"}
{"text":"I rarely give a 5-star rating but with a place like Monarch you can't go any other way. Everything from the atmosphere to service to food was beyond superb. You will spend a lot of money but it's worth it because the whole evening will be a night you won't forget. Every spot in the restaurant was thoughtfully decorated with its own unique charm, even the bathroom! The outside patio had lights to make the space feel intimate and romantic, and 1920s music playing to match the vibe of the restaurant.   The 4-course meal is excellent, I mean truly, every course is mouthwatering good! We started with cauliflower soup with white truffle oil drizzled on top, the perfect blend of flavors to start the meal! The main dish we got steak and Seabass - both are good but if I were to recommend one I'd go with steak, melts in your mouth, perfectly prepared, it'll rock your world!  All staff go out of their way to make the night feel special, they even brought my mom a cute little gift and free dessert for her birthday! Great for a special occasion or nice date... either way it'll be a dining experience you won't forget."}
{"text":"I can't really say anything that hasn't been said over and over again in previous review.  Great service, phenomenal food, fair prices, and healthy portions.  This place is truly unique and I would come back over and over again.  However, I'm still not a fan of them not accepting credit cards which pisses me off to no end.  The personal call from the chef/owner a few days prior to our meal to confirm our reservation and other details is an excellent touch.  I would however have loved for him to drop by my table at some point during the meal.  I actually thought it was odd that he didn't.  Anyway, this is a great place and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Even though I didn't get a chance to eat here on my recent trip, Chris earned me as a fan when I stopped by.   We'd just checked out of the Valley Ho and were heading to the Fairmont when I noticed the sign for Cafe Monarch. Having read all the great reviews, we pulled into the parking lot so I could jump out and make reservations for later in our stay.  I instantly liked the look of the place: cute, cozy little house with some porch seating. But I was still taken aback when I walked in and realized the main room was seating and open kitchen combined--in a very small space. Chris, partially hidden behind kitchen racks, greeted me right away even though he was clearly busy. I explained that I wished to make reservations for a friend's birthday on Monday. He said they're closed Monday through Wednesday (the remainder of our time in town), as he plated some amazing-looking salmon on a bed of greens. I think I looked really sad (mostly because I just wanted to grab one of those plates of salmon and dig in), so he said he was really sorry but he hoped we'd come back when next in Scottsdale.  You know I will, Chris. I'm just worried that it will be even harder to get a table next time! ;)  Note: I also asked for a menu to take with me, but Chris explained that there's never a set menu since he changes it daily, depending on which fresh ingredients he can source."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had. Expensive but amazing food, ambiance, and service. We went for our anniversary on a brief weekend trip and were so glad we did!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the epitome of fine dinning. The service from the wait staff is first class and the best I've ever experienced: professional, detailed and friendly. They're confident and at the same time put you at ease and make you feel comfortable and very well taken care of. The food is a 4 course menu which changes with the seasons. I've dinned here 3 times and each time has been exceptional. If you have a special occasion such as an anniversary dinner, birthday, or any holiday or even a proposal dinner. This is the place to do it. The atmosphere is romantic and classy, it's very well decorated and beautiful top to bottom."}
{"text":"Sit outside.  Wait if there aren't open tables outside.  There are bar tables on the front porch and they'll happily bring you drinks until your table is ready.  The inside is adorable, but smells of scented candles and, at least the evening we were there, was more than a little stuffy.   However, outside on the patio is one of the nicest spaces you will ever dine.  Bordered by thick foliage and large palm trees, lights strung overhead between you and the stars, just adorable, quant decorative touches, it's a pleasant and a perfect space for a special occasion, even it that special occasion is just dinner with a loved one.    Wife loved the Honey Pair cocktail, so much she had a second. My Prohibition was interesting, but the walnut was a bit too overwhelming.  Wine list short but brilliant; you don't see rose tavel on wine lists by the glass often and it's perfect for the setting.  The list felt well thought out by people who care.   Service impeccable, from front desk through the meal.    No reason to highlight the dishes, since they will be different when you go.  What's important to know is that they are well composed, consistently tasty, not huge portions.  You really don't need any \"add ons\" served with the main course.  Service will be a little slow, particularly with the main course. But you won't mind just relaxing in the beautiful setting, and it's a chance to have another class of rose tavel."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for our Anniversary this year. I was so excited to try this place and along with the price tag, I had high expectations. The food was fantastic, the ambiance is truly romantic and old world beautiful. We sat outside, the twinkle lights are in abundance and everything about the décor screams quaint European which always appeals to me. I would have been happy to give 5 stars, but unfortunately I was disappointed with our server (sorry I have forgotten his name). He was friendly and knowledgeable but slow on our orders and when we arrived it was not very busy. I noticed that every table had a flower in the middle except ours and our candle was not lit. So, I asked if he might light our candle and possibly bring me a flower. He did light the candle but never brought me a flower. He also did not check on us throughout the night after he brought our meal. So, while I loved the food and ambiance, the service that we received was less than impressive and the"}
{"text":"Very intimate& romantic setting. The food is exquisite. I highly recommend the wine pairing option. On point."}
{"text":"One of the best of the best. Excellent service, excellent food, excellent ambiance. This place is a definite must try. I don't usually give restaurants a 5 star but this place totally deserves it.  Everyone is so nice & welcoming from the moment you arrive until the time you leave. The food speaks for itself? sauces are near perfection with their distinct taste and texture. The wine pairing is an excellent choice as well with wines from Europe and California. You won't regret your visit here..."}
{"text":"My partner and I had our anniversary dinner at Cafe Monarch last Sunday.  It was a wonderful experience.  Chef Chris was very charming.  The weather was cool and he had a couple of outdoor fireplaces going with fragrant pecan wood. We had the whole place to ourselves outside!  It was very romantic.  The food was simply outstanding--we placed ourselves in his oh so capable hands!! We are already looking forward to going back with some friends.  Plan ahead on your dates and you will not be sorry!!  This special place has been discovered.  Enjoy the experience!!"}
{"text":"The wine pairing was phenomenal and accompanied the food beautifully.   Both Richard & Sam delivered an outstanding quality of service, which made the experience incredible.   Look forward to coming back soon"}
{"text":"Always great! Coffee is excellent, fresh ingredients, etc.  Christopher goes out of his way to make sure everyone's experience is wonderful.  We normally go here for lunch and it is always fast enough so we get back to the office on time."}
{"text":"More than a restaurant, Cafe Monarch is a Phoenix must-do-before-you-die. As every review proclaims, Chris is a culinary maven who makes every experience unique and custom to the preferences and tastes of his clientele.  This is by no means a large restaurant; the dining room fits maybe 5-7 small tables with views of the chef at work constructing off the cuff dishes. And while the idea is that you sit close together with other people--this is a neighborhood restaurant after all, you don't feel crammed among strangers.  Definitely make reservations for dinner and be sure to tell Chris about any dietary restrictions. We stopped in for brunch yesterday at 11:30 but were easily enticed by the lunch menu displayed on the daily chalk board. Gruyere and cheddar grilled cheese with spicy chipotle tomato soup was the perfect meal for a wintery afternoon. Still hungry? Sure! Chris whipped up a chicken dish, lightly seasoned with chopped eggplant and sweet black rice which was enough for 2 but technically was for us to \"split\" only charging us for 3 plates total. A choice of iced tea or Cafe du Monde coffee was offered and we chose the iced tea infused with hibiscus and other fruity flavors, perfectly flavored yet unsweetened.   Dinner runs about $50 a plate and bunch/lunch $20. Cash ONLY and BYOB ($10 corkage fee).   Perfect for out of town guests, special occasions or if just you're craving delectable food. Even though it's becoming well-known, it feels like a secret place you discover every time you go."}
{"text":"As I began my journey to the outdoor patio visions of the small quaint kitchen, hanging lit lanterns and beautiful music made me feel as if I was in a house on the French Countryside. Our meal from start to finish was one of the best both of us have ever had. The Filet Mignon melted in my mouth and was balanced with a corn relish. The ambiance and service was top notch. I had some restrictions for allergies and chef whipped up several wonderful alternatives. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! The vibe and the atmosphere is phenomenal! I love the smaller menu because truthfully everything you have here is delectable.  I was excited to have the best ingredients at the time with the most incredible flavors! Love this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The most romantic and intimate restaurant on the valley, it's truly a celebration itself and should be reserved for the best occasions. Their three course meal changes regularly, but I have been back and on a few occasions, they will feature previous dishes once more. Their cauliflower soup is outstanding and a salad I had, which had candied bacon and pecans in it, was unmatched by any other, as for their entrées, the filet is almost always available, or a form of it. Their wait staff is thoroughly knowledgeable of the menus, inside and out, and will help pair anything with the perfect wine. What a divine place this is."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink after leaving craft 64. Drinks and service were a 10 and the courtyard itself was so comfortable. It was a pleasure just sitting there and enjoying a cocktail. I can't wait to return for a full meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful, absolutely wonderful. SUCH a great, charming atmosphere. The food was unique and delicious--Chris, the owner/chef, only prepares a select choice of meals per day; we went for breakfast this morning and there were two options. We both had the crostini, which was amazing--grilled pear, goat cheese, arugula, large pieces of toast, oranges, blueberries, and strawberries. Chris even gave me a complimentary glass of Prosecco to give cheer to my recent move to Scottsdale. The pricing was $20/person for breakfast. Well worth it. A great find."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely stunning! The courtyard is the most romantic setting for an amazing coursed menu. Highly recommend for a dinner with your significant one if you're ever in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is one of my top restaurants in Scottsdale. It is very romantic and the food is fabulous!  Try to get the outdoor patio... it is breath taking :)"}
{"text":"This is an absolute treat!  First off, make sure you make reservations for this place. We had reservations but we still ended up waiting another 15-20 mins for them to get our table ready. We sat at the bar and enjoyed a cocktail prior to being escorted to our table.   When we got to our table, the waiter gave us a rundown of the menu and the specials. He was knowledgeable and gave us a few recommendations of what he liked but it was pretty much everything on the menu.   It was a 4 course meal with the option of dessert (sort of). Everything was delicious. My only knock on it was that the waiter asked us what kind of dessert we liked and we said chocolate - he brought it out and charged us for it. I guess, it was a misunderstanding on our part. We were already full so we wouldn't have gotten it if we had to pay for it.   I would still recommend it for a special occasion as it was $280 or so for 2 people after tip."}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch had great food, service and atmosphere. My boyfriend and I went for our one year anniversary and the intimate setting was perfect for the occasion. Chef Chris made salmon and pork and they both were delicious. We especially liked the appetizer, it was the perfect amount and flavor with the pesto, tomatoes, prosciutoo and fennel. We highly recommend this restaurant and would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have ever had! Great atmosphere as well! Would highly recommend to all. Joined yelp just to write a review on this place!"}
{"text":"A delightful experience! Exceptional service, romantic atmosphere. The patio supposed to be more romantic (it really was) but I believe the interior has more ambiance. Well. Next time!"}
{"text":"A gem that is evocative of a resto in the south of France. Incredible service that isn't overly solicitous, romantic courtyard decorated so beautifully, and gorgeous, delicious food with a wonderful wine list. A must-do for any romantic night out. We will absolutely be back. This place was fabulous."}
{"text":"Love love this place! Quality and fresh food, excellent service and the food presentation is amazing! You can tell the chef is very skilled and creative which you can actually feel at every bite of his food! Also the place is very cute and romantic perfect for Date night or special occasions."}
{"text":"I researched the reviews and it did not let me down.  Valentine's Weekend Menu and the experience were worth the deposit taken at the time of reservation.   Place was at capacity.   The cauliflower soup was crazy good and I am a bone-in ribeye sort."}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch is so good that I feel like it deserves 10, not 5, stars. If only I could give them.   Cafe Monarch is an intimate and romantic restaurant in Scottsdale. The ambiance is absolutely perfect - this is a perfect date night or event location - and the design is rather unique. The service is absolutely phenomenal in every way - our server, Brendan, was basically a mind-reader, and the sommelier (a member of the sommeliers guild, no less) definitely knew his stuff.   The food was perfect, and I really mean that. It began with a sweet potato and pumpkin soup, which was savory and perfectly accented with a bit of cinnamon. The appetizer, a salad with blood orange and prosciutto, was possibly the best I have ever had in every sense. The filet mignon was, of course, transcendent - perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and perfectly accented by an amazing sauce. The dessert, a rum cake, accented the end of the meal perfectly.   Alcohol-wise, this place rocks. The wine was expertly paired and added to the meal significantly.  The cocktails were also excellent - I had the \"Winter Wonderland,\" which mixed delicious mint and cranberry with herbs and other delicious tastes.   Needless to say, this is possibly the best restaurant I have ever eaten at - and I've eaten at a lot."}
{"text":"Such a fun experience, we have already recommended Cafe Monarch to several friends! We went for brunch, and you pick between 2 options, drinks are self service. The food was delicious! Maybe not fully worth $20 for baked french toast....but fine. Chris came around afterward and chatted with us, which was quite nice."}
{"text":"$13 well cocktail, $65.00 breast of chicken, seated and asked to move in favor of another party...this is the place for you.    Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic evening here celebrating our Anniversary! Chris was our server & made everything special. We requested a quiet table outside and it was perfect. My entree came out a little cold but Chris made it right. Highly recommend this restaurant for a romantic evening."}
{"text":"\"A Most Romantic Dinner in Old Scottsdale\"  Cafe Monarch should drop the \"Cafe\" because it takes away from the sheer elegance, and romantic setting of this fantastic restaurant. The magical atmosphere was reminiscent of Le Vallauris in Palm Springs.  We went with our good friends from Chicago, and asked to be seated in their Courtyard, which is definitely the place to be. With tiny lights, it transforms the Monarch like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis.   The drinks are creative. They have a four course prix fixe menu. The roasted cauliflower soup was superb with nice touches of smoked pine nuts, garlic confit, beet chips and white truffle oil créme fraiche. The spring salad was loaded with surprises including smoked goat cheese, roasted brussel sprouts and beets, pickled yellow beets, cashews, and a chile garlic vinaigrette. This was followed by an ahi tuna poke or a vegetarian pasta offering.   There were four main courses to choose from including a macadamia crusted halibut, filet mignon, crispy skin chicken breast or polenta lasagna. We had the halibut and filet which were nicely prepared.  They gave my wife a beautiful complimentary dessert with a nice keepsake. Our server Sam was attentive and knowledgable.  We all agreed Monarch was our favorite restaurant on our trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks like an illustration off the page of a storybook. The decor of this quaint cottage is classic and pretty. We sat in front at a small table outside in the shade of a big tree.  Chris is an anomaly. He was by himself cooking, hosting, and serving. I was impressed by his calm demeanor and grace. He ran his restaurant with a smooth efficiency. Busy as a bee but filled with purpose.    My dish of turkey with cranberry sauce, julienned apples, mandarin oranges, mixed greens, and bread chips reflects everything about this man's cooking. He understands flavors and cohesiveness. He also has an eye for beauty, each part of my plate reflected his attention to color and detail.  My mom had made Korean food for Thanksgiving instead of the traditional stuff. But thanks to Chris I still got my Thanksgiving fix, in a gourmet way. It was nice having the best of both worlds. I had a lot to be thankful for."}
{"text":"When initially seated for our reservation, we were placed at a table near the bar area, which proved far too noisy. We asked to be seated elsewhere & after a few minutes, were advised they could move us but that the wait would be another 45 minutes. After deciding the wait was acceptable, we were lead to a set of small tables, which were placed in an area we found just as noisy. We asked if we might instead sit in the little area we'd been seated upon our arrival at the restaurant & were accommodated. (I suspect by this time they'd labeled us pretentious!) While awaiting the next table they graciously offered us a new round of cocktails & a delicious nosh (a bruschetta of shredded Brussels sprouts, nuts & jam; apologies to all for not capturing the exact ingredients). In what seemed little time at all we were taken to the courtyard & seated at a comfortable table towards the back. Sommelier, Wesam (Sam) Kawa, captured our selections from the four course prix fixe menu & was delighted we chose the wine pairing. Four of us were dining & we started with roasted cauliflower soup & scallop tartare. The white truffle oil & créme fraîche in the soup balanced the cauliflower beautifully, providing an earthy taste & luxurious mouthfeel. Subtle hints of lime highlighted the  gentle heat of the aguachile in the tartare. We moved to a salad of young bittersweet greens, compressed watermelon, softly pickled rind, lardon & lavash. Many people dismiss salad, yet shouldn't; especially when it's as delicately composed & as  lightly dressed as this one was. Two of us chose to follow the salad with the Niman Ranch beef stuffed samosa & two with the crab cake. The samosa was flaky; the combination of beef & tabbouleh & accompanying yogurt sauce complimented the crust without it becoming overly soft or soggy. I love pork, yet I'm often reluctant to order it out since it's typically over cooked. Sam convinced me to give the Iberico pork chop a try as my entry & I cannot thank him enough - it was succulent. Some may laugh, yet I chose not to eat all of my chop because I wanted to enjoy more (taking a large leftover portion home means I can delight in this entry over two days)! Had I known in advance how light & flavorful the rum cake we ordered for dessert would be, I'd have ordered three (gluttony: thy name is...)! Truly, this was a fresh food, full flavored, delicious & pleasurable dining experience!My compliments to the chef, his kitchen staff & to our server, Sam. My thanks as well to the management for their courtesy, complimentary cocktails & nosh."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the Phoenix metro area, bar none.   Amazing ambiance, even more amazing food, and they're very vegetarian friendly. You can't beat it.   If you live in the area and haven't tried it, you're truly missing out. Absolutely 100% recommended."}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch is a fine Dinning Restaurant located in Old Town Scottsdale. This is a multi award winning restaurant. Voted best romantic restaurant in the country by Yelp....Voted Number ONE Restaurant of Scottsdale by Tripadvisor out of 956 restaurants (in 2018). This is a reservation ONLY restaurant. Walk ins are not accepted. They offer fixed priced four course dinners that run at 2018 prices of between $80-$140.00. Wine pairing runs around $95.00 a person or you can purchase cocktails or bottles of wine. We thought the bottle pricing was a reasonable mark up. They only marked up the pricing less than half on our bottle and many places usually mark up the prices much more than that. The menu changes every other week so it's unlikely you will be able to try what I tried.  To cut a long story short.........  Atmosphere is amazing.....if weather is nice you might want to request patio dining in your reservation.  Service was very professional and servers are trained in sommelier training.  The food is mostly very detailed and high quality.   If they offer the Squash Blossom Relleno - GET IT......It was one of the very best things I tried anywhere. Very Complex and full of textures...so flavorful....wish I could eat a plate of them.  Another favorite of the evening was the Yellow Fin Tuna Crudo.......Really Great......full of flavors.  The dirt......Chairs inside are not so comfortable. Springs are broken and chairs are in need of repair or replacement.  More DIRT.....Not a fan of the Bananas Foster bread pudding....so much so I might never order dessert here again...Very dense, not sweet, unripe bananas.....  A most lovely dinner....not perfect....but for the most part if I ignore the dessert ...then very good -  to -  exceptional.  4.5 stars"}
{"text":"I had to come up with some place special for my wife's 30th birthday this week. Wanted it to be somewhere romantic with amazing food. Enter Cafe Monarch.   Arrived for our reservation at 8:30. Taken straight back to our cozy little spot by the fountain on the patio. This place is beautiful. The lighting and ambiance in the back on the patio made me totally forget that merely hours earlier I was cursing at the sun and wondering if I would ever be able to hydrate again. The misters were on and it felt perfect (it hit 109 degrees today).  Our waiter came out quickly and explained the menu and we ordered some wine. Smallish wine list but some great choices. Went for some Oregon pino.  The meal started with amuse bouche of sweet pea soup with lobster, sweet corn and mint. This stuff was mouth watering. I could have had three more bowls....a solid start.  Next was a summer salad of arugula, citrus, compressed cucumber, and tomatoes. Fresh and delicious.  The only choice here, other than the drinks are to decide which entree you want. Tonight they had a choice between Hawaiian opah and flat iron steak. We ordered one of each. Both were amazing. The I fish had a wasabi flavored  purée side alone with a vegetable like hash ( I do it no justice ). So so,good. The steak was a perfect medium rare. My mouth is still watering just thinking about it.  Desert was a light peach Napoleon. Light, sweet, and yummy.  Yelp is rarely wrong. There is a good reason this place gets the best reviews. My wife was impressed, full, and snugly, just as planned. They even gave her a little birthday present.  This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. I have zero negative things to say.   Bravo Cafe Monarch. Bravo."}
{"text":"Wow.  That about sums it up.  After cancelling a brunch reservation for my fiance's birthday, we scurried on over to Cafe Monarch.  Fabulous Sunday, and the weather is gorgeous.  We drive up to Cafe Monarch a little early to avoid the Sunday crowd (thanks to the advice of some reviewers since Cafe Monarch is a one-man show and can get pretty busy).  There are beautiful monarch butterflies flying around the outside of the Cafe.  Beautiful landscaping and cafe style, white linen tables adorn Monarch.    Chef Chris is outside writing up the day's sweet & savory brunch menu.  We walk on over, and he remembers the message I had left him the day before.  He wishes Edgar a happy birthday.  He explains the way the restaurant is run and tells us to help ourselves to the beverage area as there's hibiscus tea, coffee, water w/mint leaves and orange juice.  A cute little station with beautiful drinkware.  We help ourselves and get comfy on a bench outside.    A few minutes in, his helper comes out and tells us to take a seat anywhere we'd like and asks us what we would like to order.  We order one each of both dishes.  One savory and one sweet.  When our meals actually came out, we took one bit, and I went inside to tell Chef Chris to bring us each the opposite of what we just ordered.  We couldn't share!  It was too dang good!  DELICIOUS is an understatement!  For the sweet dish we had pumpkin french toast with roasted pear, amber maple syrup, cranberry butter and spicy chicken sausage.  For savory we had grilled porkloin w/feta, herb potatoes, fried egg and tomato sauce.    The flavors that were extracted from these dishes are unbelievable.  Chef Chris creates a custom menu every single day, and you'll never have the same meal here.  It was divine.  The french toast is one, if not THE BEST french toast my fiance and I have ever had anywhere.  We didn't drench the french toast with syrup as there was no need for it.  The texture was spot on, and it was moist.  The cranberry butter was absolutely delicious, and it accompanied nicely to the chicken sausage.    The porkloin was cooked PERFECTLY.  Not dry and not under done.  The herb potatoes were stacked beautifully with wonderful herbs and spices, and the very top layer was crispy.  Perfectly cooked fried eggs (it takes a real special person to make perfect eggs in my opinion), and the tomato sauce was out of this world.  This wasn't some run of the mill tomato sauce.  It was home made, thick and hearty tomato sauce.    This was the perfect way to end our trip to Scottsdale, and we were so happy to have been able to experience Cafe Monarch.  Chef Chris is truly talented, and you can feel his passion and love for what he does.  Not a lot of Chefs carry this same passion, but he does.  There is LOVE in each and every dish - no factory style kitchen dishes coming out of here.    My fiance said it... \"the best breakfast I've ever had.\"  Thank you again Chef Chris!"}
{"text":"Oh boy!!! If you are in for some scrumptious, finger licking good home-made food this is the place to go. Chris is the chef and a wonderful host. He has an amazing talent with the kitchen. Everything he makes is devine and deliciuos. I had the honor of celebrating my post graduation lunch here with my family. They were all very impressed with presentation, taste, and mood; that they want to return, ASAP! More importantly, my 104yr old grandfather (who is a very picky eater, I might add) ate everything we served him and ZERO complaints. I believe he ate more than me! Thank you Chef Chris for such a memorable dining experience.  You are soo talented. I will definately be returning."}
{"text":"GREAT experience. Made a reservation for the day before Valentine's Day for an early celebration. The staff made it extra special for my wife and I. It's a 4-course pre-fixe. Menu changes often, they source locally. The cauliflower soup is amazing, duck was great, winter salad fantastic. I had seafood risotto - a little on the salty side, but still very very good. My wife enjoyed the scallops - absolutely amazing. We opted to add-on crab cakes which melted in our mouths. The ambiance is incredible. A must for special occasions! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent environment, and excellent food.  I went for brunch and the food was seasonal and fantastic with both sweet and savory choices.  Just remember to bring cash..."}
{"text":"My daughter found Cafe Monarch on Yelp and we decided to go there for dinner while on vacation last week - 5/8.   Based on reviews, we had high expectations for Cafe Monarch as we decided to spend the money to enjoy a culinary experience at a highly recommended restaurant.   Cafe Monarch didn't disappoint.   It was the real deal and it was of the best restaurant meal experiences I've been able to share with my family.    I was a bit worried about the small first, second and third courses but those were my favorite part of the meal.   It was so nice to try something wonderful and have time to rest in between.   The presentation was really very nice and added to the experience.   I was also afraid that the entree was going to be smaller but I under estimated the meal.   It was a lot of food and the experience was a highlight of our vacation.   Don't be fooled by the description on the menu and trust your server to steer you through the meal.   It was really everything we had wanted and more."}
{"text":"The best place I have been to...my fiance is pregnant and is due shortly and wanted to treat us out...honestly you pay for what you get..and that is perfection in the food and the drinks..even the water..mint and cucumbers out of this world..the patio is very rustic and old school it is a perfect romantic setting..if I have the money again I would love to check out that weeks menu!!! Place from the outside looks like a hole in the wall..but man does the food and crew throw you for a loop!!"}
{"text":"I can't give this place enough stars. My husband surprised me with a meal here tonight for my birthday. Best food experience of our lives. The food was outstanding. 4 course meal with the menu changed bi weekly. Every course was better than the last. Sam was our waiter and a trained sommolier. The wait staff treats each customer like royalty. I can't wait to go back and we told Sam we would be requesting him again. They even gave me a dessert and gift for my birthday. I've never had a restaurant actually give me a gift. 10 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here - the food was exceptional - enough said.  Great mix of flavors from unique pairings!  The atmosphere really knocks it out of the park.  Upon arrival, even for just a short wait for our table, we sat outside at a private table to have a cocktail and review the menu.  The outdoor courtyard is really lovely - dimly lit, romantic but lively, and surrounded by foliage (no street view).  The service was also excellent.  Always attentive, accommodating, very friendly, and prompt. We will most certainly be back! Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing! This is our second time and our 8 year old wanted to visit this restaurant, so as a \"done with 2nd grade celebration,\" we decided to surprise her with dinner here. The ambiance is so beautiful, the restaurant even smells of a winter wonderland (not even kidding). The service is outstanding, everyone that works here knows the current menu inside and out. We love that the menu is changing, so there's always something new and exciting to try. Our first dining experience was with Chris and this time John. Both of these gentlemen were so kind, attentive, and 100% great! This is a restaurant we will keep coming back too."}
{"text":"If you enjoy amazing food, exemplary service and really cool ambiance you can't go wrong with Cafe Monarch in Scottsdale.  Definitely one of the better dining experiences my wife and I have had in the four years we've been together.  For starters the owner of the place Christian was our server and was extremely knowledgeable about everything, pleasant and remarkably down to earth despite owning a highly successful restaurant in Scottsdale.  Probably attributed to the fact that he busted into the industry busing tables 15 years ago. They have a fixed menu that can literally change almost daily so they take all of the thinking out of it.  They even have a wine pairing for the fixed menu that isn't part of the normal wine list to make sure it is the perfect match.  No small detail goes unnoticed.  You just sit back and enjoy all of the amazing courses while enjoying some tasty and unique cocktails or vino.  I can't imagine having a bad experience at this place and despite always wanting to try new places, I would definitely come back here if we visit the Scottsdale area again.  Keep up the great work Christian!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch is an absolute must-try dining destination!  Chris, the owner,  is a one-man show taking reservations, prepping, cooking, and even washing his own dishes. He works very swiftly and efficiently with just one server running the food. He shared that he was a Northwestern graduate, and Cafe Monarch was his creative outlet.   The 3-course dinner was amazing!! Our first course consisted of eggplant tapenade with perfectly cooked asparagus and buttery toast. The portions were huge.   Next, we were given an option between salmon with sweet corn and spinach or pork tenderloins with Japanese cashew rice. The salmon was delicious.   Chris not only created a wonderful meal, he entertained us with his witty jokes and keen sense of intuition. We were celebrating our friend's bachelorette so he asked us to go around and share one word about her. He added his own observation: compassion. He couldn't be more spot on about her and I know she really appreciated his thoughtfulness.  It's byob with $10 corkage/bottle. I would definitely return the next time I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"An excellent meal, great ambience in the courtyard, and exceptional service.  Definitely request courtyard seating for full experience."}
{"text":"I am surprised at all the 5 star reviews.  Café Monarch is mediocre for the expense.  My boyfriend surprised me for my 40th birthday with a dinner at Café Monarch.  We were impressed with the restaurant concept, high end, delectable fare, operated as a one-man show.    The starter white bean soup was bland and the main meal was very, very spicy.  It took about 3 hours to get through only three courses; it was BYOB unfortunately the owner/chef charged us a corking fee.   We were not able to choose what we wanted for dinner, we only noted any food allergies we may have had and the chef prepared surprise spicy beef dishes.  When making the reservation, the owner/chef/waiter offered to make a special birthday treat and asked my boyfriend what my favorite dessert was.  He told him that  I love cupcakes and Chef said he would make them for us.  At the end of our meal, he informed us that he had sold all of my cupcakes.  That was absolutely, positively, 100% unacceptable.  I do understand why it took so long to prepare and serve the meals, but just that he sold out all of my birthday cupcakes, not even just saving one for the birthday girl, was disappointing.  Unfortunately, I will not visit Café Monarch again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. It was absolutely magical. The atmosphere, the food, the service - exceptional! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Everything you could want in a cozy neighborhood fine dining establishment.  The restaurant looks to be converted from a small home, so seating is pretty limited--but that just adds to the charm.  Location is very central to downtown Scottsdale, but enough off beaten path that it feels hidden.  Decor and atmosphere are a fun mix between country garden and creole soul.  Food excellent!  And if you sit inside, you get to enjoy watching Chef Chris work only a few feet away.  Its like dining at the home of a close friend--who happens to have an industrial grade kitchen, and can throw down in it.  To know, before you go: Cash only and BYOB."}
{"text":"My wife and I just celebrated our anniversary here. The food and wine was excellent, we truly enjoyed everything that we had. And they also went above and beyond what I expected when they brought my wife out an anniversary present after the dinner. It made the entire experience perfect. The staff is intelligent and great to converse with throughout the dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. We sat outdoors in their garden area and it was so beautiful. The service definitely deserves 5 stars. The rum cake was well worth the wait- I got surf and turf which was a lot of food! I wouldn't recommend getting it unless you are really hungry. Pricey but if I'm ever in Scottsdale I will definitely return here!"}
{"text":"What an experience!  This is a quaint, romantic setting perfect for special occasions or even a date night out.  You feel as though you are in Chef Chris' own kitchen and the staff is so welcoming.  This is NOT a dinner that is rushed.  I am not sure why some reviewers were upset that they didn't get their food in a more timely manner - my fiance and I had such a great time talking and drinking in between each course.  There was no pressure for the table to be turned over, the staff wasn't looming over us waiting to drop the check.  How awesome is that?!  Each course was timed perfectly and every bite was fantastic.  We were served a three course meal based on our preferences discussed in the initial reservation phone call.  At the end of the night, Chef also let us sample one of the other entree option.  The food was phenomenal.  It was great, as well, to be able to bring in our own bottle of wine and champagne to accompany dinner.  The restaurant is BYOB and cash only.  Don't let the negative reviews sway you from the amazing evening that awaits you at Cafe Monarch.  THANK YOU Chef Chris and staff! It was truly a special evening."}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch has atmosphere in spades and excellent food to match! Having just rolled into town for a work trip, we showed up before the day's menu had yet been written on the chalkboard. We were content to enjoy the serene ambiance over cups of cold water and a mug of chickory coffee as the chef chose the day's offerings and began prepping in the little kitchen that juts out into the dining area. The chef was friendly and fun, chatting with us and the other patrons that trickled in as the morning grew longer.   Of the four or so dishes, I chose a grilled cheese with gruyere and a tomato basil salad, my companion a salad with roasted pears and prosciutto. I can promise it's not hyperbole when I say that this was the most wonderful meal I've had in a long time! The tomatoes were divine, the basil abundant and I don't even know what was in the dressing, but it was amazing.   The greatest feature of this restaurant--besides the delicious food--is the chef, who is also host and server. He gave me a little tag with a butterfly stamped in blank ink as a souvenir on my way out the door. How could he know this is just the type of thing I save in little boxes or tuck into books to remember my excursions?   I also enjoyed the charming decor with its the blue-tinted Ball jars, casement windows and pewter plates mounted on the wall. It felt a little French provincial--cozy and casual, yet elegant. Truly, there's some kind of magic about Cafe Monarch, which you'll have to discover yourself."}
{"text":"Based upon the reviews, we had high expectations. Each course of the pre-fix menu of outstanding. Nothing was just very good. Each course had its creative elements in addition to simply tasting great. My wife had the sea bass and I had the steak. Both were extremely good. Although it could be viewed as a bit costly ($65 per person), the pre-fix wines were of very high quality and paired well for each course. Some of the wines were of very limited availability and would carry a high tariff. However, considering we had a total of 4 glasses, it was justifiable. The interior is quite unique and interesting. All together, it was a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"The service from entering to exiting Monarch is impeccable. Service is an art at Monarch. It's the kind royalty gets too used to. The waiters (I noticed only the men served) were attentive to every detail from when we needed water poured to folding our napkins if we left the table even momentarily. Our four-course meal was a palette adventure. A masterpiece that caused our tongues to lash out for being deprived of such intensely delicious flavors for so long! Not one dish was disagreeable. Not even the foie gras, an acquired taste of a meal. I would have been quite satisfied on the soup and salad alone.  My hubby prejudged that the seemingly small portions would not fill him up, but his stomach was feeling heavy before he even took his last bite. In our book, Monarch is reserved for the special, blue moon occasions.  And for us, and a few nearby table mates, that was exactly the case. We were celebrating our fourth wedding anniversary. We won't soon forget Monarch because we can't return any time soon.   Ambiance = 5 stars Service = 5 stars Food = 5+ stars Good time with hubby = pricey"}
{"text":"My date and I ate brunch here on Sunday.  We both liked the casual cottage atmosphere.  Almost feels like an english garden rather than the Arizona desert.  We were given two choices for brunch at $20 which includes tax and tip.  Sweet (baked french toast with bacon and fresh berries) or Savory (chicken with a sweet red chile sauce and two eggs sunnyside up).  We decided to each order one and share.  The sweet dish was ok, the french toast didn't have a lot of flavor but the berries were fresh and the bacon was extra crispy (yum!).  The savory dish was very good and had a nice taste.  Overall a nice sunday experience, a bit pricey for breakfast (breaks down to about $16 a plate before tax/tip) but might try again to see what else comes up on the menu."}
{"text":"We chose Cafe Monarch for a company party. None of us knew what we were in for. We all left raving about our meals! A truly flavorful, playful experience. The ambiance is so romantic, if we lived in Scottsdale this would definitely be our go-to date night spot. We chose to do the wine pairing with our meals and this just complimented the flavors of every dish so well. We were thrilled! I had the duck- so rich and creamy. I'll be dreaming about that meal for months to come. Our server was SO knowledgable and helpful. We really enjoyed him. When we met up with the rest of our group (different groups visited different restaurants around Scottsdale) we were the only party that couldn't stop talking about how amazing our experience was. 10/10 would visit again."}
{"text":"Good food but service was soo slow... the timing between courses was way too long.. restaurant was extremely noisy also. One very positive.. the chef was extremely attentive to One in our party had very specific dietary needs. Her foid was perfect and tasted great. Cudos to the chef."}
{"text":"This was hands down my favorite restaurant in Phoenix for years. I LOVED the patio and the building, it was so quaint. Very upscale shabby chic. I was incredibly disappointed to see the new building when I took my grandmother there for her birthday. The atmosphere changed from comfortable, fun and eclectic to overly grandiose in a way that is unflattering. The food was still quite good but half of the experience was the atmosphere. I don't know that I'll be going back anytime soon. :("}
{"text":"Yup. I fell in love again. Reborn. Unreal.  This place is purely amazing to say any other word than \"perfect\" to describe Cafe Monarch, would just be cruel injustice.   Every dish left my hubby and me speechless. Their cocktails were phenomenal too and complemented the dishes. We tried \"The Monarch\", \"The Spaniard\", and \"El Diablo\". All very tasty but my favorite was \"The Monarch\" just because I love the fresh fruit juice concoction.   I love that it's a set menu of 4 courses:  1. Roasted Cauliflower Soup - literally woke us up and prepared us for what's to come next  2. Spring Salad - This is what I envision what Spring would taste like. I'm just drooling thinking about it again  3. Lollipop Lamb Chop - Exactly like the name. I wanted to pick up the lamb chop and save it for dessert because it was so good  4. There are 4 selections to choose from but I got the \"Rosemary Seared Filet Mignon\" - The filet literally cut like butter and just melted in my mouth  There was a complementary dessert for me since it was my birthday - their Rum Cake, which was out of this world and they even gave me a gift! It's a cute delicate jewelry box. I loved it!   I love restaurants that take the time to be detailed in their décor, service, and everything else. Their attention to detail and consideration definitely showed from entering the restaurant until the last step I took as we walked out - completely blown away!   We'll definitely be going back in the near future, special occasion or not :)"}
{"text":"This is a rare eating experience where they get everything right. Honestly, both my wife and I agree that after dining here it makes you rethink all those four and five star reviews I have given to other restaurants. Service was spot on. Food was perfection including filet cooked perfectly, halibut with citrus crust that had just the right amount of flavor, soup with roasted pine nuts that added just the right amount of smoke, and a salad that was to die for. The poke was good with fresh corn that snapped when you ate it. Yes, this is about as good as it gets and I honestly want to take one star away now from my other restaurant reviews. Thank you for making our anniversary dinner so special!"}
{"text":"The best restaurant I've ever been to - from the ambiance (sit on patio!), to the service, to obviously the food and wine. Our reservation was running a little late so they provided delicious bruschetta and ceviche while we waited. Because we were celebrating my bday, they even gave me a small gift with a sparkler dessert. The ultimate special occasion resto. Bring your pocketbook, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was my first fine dining experience and it was amazing! Although the staff could probably tell that we weren't used to the this kind of dining they were all super friendly and were knowledgeable about the menu. They also were great with accommodating to me being vegetarian and were well rehearsed in what I could enjoy. The atmosphere makes you forget you are in Scottsdale, Arizona and transports you to Rome or Tuscany. There was only one thing that my friend and I found a little weird. The hostesses, who was very friendly and well mannered, would not stop smiling for the life of her. I understand that they want to appear as friendly as can be but I became worried that they took her soul or something. It was robotic like to have this person walking with a  full tooth smile plastered on their face and it never wavering . I imagine her face has to hurt at the end of the night. Overall, my experience here was amazing and I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Ever wondered what it's like to visit the Secret Garden? I imagine the atmosphere would sort of be like the patio at Cafe Monarch. Head past the intimate chef's kitchen dining room, which seats about 10, and through the gorgeous indoor restaurant that will make you feel like you're in a castle dining room, and walk out to the patio covered in candles, featuring a fountain, and ensconced with flowers. It's one of the most romantic restaurants in the Valley I've ever been to, and it re-opens Friday, October 4, after new ownership.  Every night, Cafe Monarch features a unique three-course prix fixe menu, based on seasonal items and Chef Andrew Nienke's taste. Call ahead if you have special dietary needs, and they'll adjust the menu accordingly for you.  I went there last week with some girlfriends -- thank you so much to new owner Christian Lewkowicz for the invitation -- and had one of the freshest meals I've ever had. We started with a watermelon salad, which came with huge chunks of juicy watermelon and a bed of fresh greens. I love watermelon salad, and this one was extra-tasty.  My pals had salmon and filets for their entrees, while I got to nibble on quinoa topped with fresh carrots and leeks. The portion size was huge and left me stuffed.  For dessert, we were treated to freshly baked puff pastries topped with fresh berries and vanilla ice cream. I slurped up every bite of the dessert, which was light and refreshing and managed to seem healthy because of the fruit.   My favorite part of Cafe Monarch, though, was the atmosphere and hospitality. The service was amazing and made you feel like you were in your own little world -- perfect for an anniversary dinner or special get-together. Our meals would have cost $45 each, which was a steal for such unique culinary creations and such top-notch ingredients. The relaxed atmosphere will transport you out of the Valley for a night and make you feel like you're in your own private retreat."}
{"text":"I have to say that I'm very sad it's closed for the summer months, but good for Chris for taking some well deserved time off as this is a one man show.  Chris does everything, I do mean everything, from cooking your meals to washing the dishes.  Every experience I've had there has exceeded my expectations from the food to the service.  This is one of the few hidden treasures of the Valley.  Though do not expect to a quick in and out.  Expect to stay and savor your meal and your dining experience!"}
{"text":"Welcome to another secret garden of Old Town Scottsdale. Are you wondering where Cafe Monarch is located? Well, it's hidden in the most delightful way and I wouldn't want it to be any other way. But if you really want to find it (and I don't know if I want to give the secret away), I will say that it's located just south of Indian School off of Goldwater.   When a restaurant has a five star average and nearly 60 reviews, they've got to be doing something right. Cafe Monarch is no exception. After months of anticipation, Cafe Monarch finally reopened its doors after a summer hiatus and I couldn't wait to give it a try. Through yelp reviews, I heard that you come prepared to eat what the chef feels like making that day. Yelp friends, don't question the chef. He knows what he's doing. He knows what you want more than you yourself know what you want.   I began my meal with a freshly made hibiscus iced tea. It was the perfect refreshment to enjoy the warm weather on the adorable patio surrounding the restaurant. Since this is BYOB, the chef mentioned that this iced tea is also quite tasty with some vodka in it, but since I had a long day ahead of me, I went the alchi-free route this time. Possibly dinner next time? The menu had a variety of items to choose from including a chicken pesto sandwich or salad and a prosciutto panini. I went for the chicken pesto sandwich after the chef said it was his favorite (and remember, don't question the chef's choices) and I couldn't have been more pleased. The chicken was roasted to perfection and moist with freshly made cheesy pesto giving it a hug. Situated on a freshly made french baguette, it was a treat to put in my mouth and I secretly didn't want the cuisine experience to end! To accompany the sandwich, the chef made a salad full of fresh cantaloupe, grapes and strawberries. I assume he makes salads based on the season and I was very happy the fruit season was upon us! The meal was perfect. It was light and satisfying in a perfectly peaceful setting. The house is adorable and I wish my own could resemble it.   I think this could quite possibly be one of the perfect locations to dine on a lazy afternoon when I don't have a care in the world (or want to pretend that I don't). And before I go, I wanted to mention how nice the chef/owner is! He's very personable with his customers and makes each experience unique and delightful. I believe that delightful is absolutely the overall word to describe my experience at Cafe Monarch.   Some things to note before you visit:  - Cash only, so come prepared. I had an iced tea and sandwich with a salad and it was around $16.   - BYOB and if you forget, there's a Circle K just next door to buy some \"quality\" booze   - Be prepared to relax and enjoy yourself. For being a one man show, the chef/owner does an excellent job of preparing a delicacy in a short period of time, but the atmosphere is so adorable you should plan on staying to enjoy it while you're there."}
{"text":"We went there for my birthday. Their new place is gorgeous. When we arrived I was greeted with happy birthday by everyone. I agree with the other reviews that call it an amazing gem worth every penny it costs. The waiters are meticulous and every course we had was perfection. The waiter even brought me a sampling of wines to taste before ordering. I can't say enough about this incredible restaurant. Hopefully the owner & chef will be around for many years so I can continue dining here. We have been here many times and always find it perfect."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere, it is like having your own personal chef!!! Fantastic food!"}
{"text":"I tried to go for brunch the last time I was in town with my son and girlfriend but there was a private party.  This time I was able to get in with my son.  Sat in the lovely patio area.  I ordered the bacon and date sandwich.  It was so tall because the dates were whole as we're the little tomatoes.   However once it was smashed down I tried to get my mouth on it for the full experience. Let me say the sweetness of the dates with the smoky, crunch bacon and delicious bread it was so worth the mess that was made.  The lady next to our table ate it layer by layer. No fun.     My son had the salmon salad.  There was a lot of salmon.  We shared and we had a lovely time together.  We were full so didn't have dessert but  I saw someone eating the brownie and it looked really good.    This is not a cheap restaurant but if you have a special date  this would be a place to consider.  Service was good.  Glad to have finally dined there."}
{"text":"I made reservations to Cafe Monarch for a surprise night out for my boyfriend's birthday. Let me just start, if you are wanting to celebrate any special occasion, this is the perfect place! The restaurant is gorgeous with a romantic setting. The bar had an impressive selection of cocktails, scotch, whiskey, tequila, vodka, sparkling, any wine you could possibly think of, and much more. Our reservations were made for 7 but our table wasn't ready so we made our way to the bar.  Bartender suggested the Like a Stone cocktail for my sweet side and boyfriend got the Bella Sera. My only complaint would be the bar is a little small and there's a lot of traffic for the tight area. The hostess was very apologetic because our table took around 40 minutes to be ready. They comped our cocktails for the wait which was appreciated because they're a little pricey but definitely worth it.  I requested a table outside because I've heard about how beautiful the courtyard is. But of course is was stormy, cold and windy that night. So, it was nice that the hostess seated us inside. Our server, Sam, was very charming and extremely knowledgeable on the menu and wine. We decided to get a bottle of 2016 Malbec from Argentina. It was great but way to much for just us two. But hey, special occasions call for bottles right?  The four courses were divine. My boyfriend and I ordered opposite so we could have a try of everything. When it came to the entree, I ordered the seafood risotto because Sam promised he'd tell me how to make it. He never did so next time he owes me. Haha. My love ordered the surf and turf which he really enjoyed. Food like this is worth every penny. Everything was cooking to perfection and the flavors were sophisticated and blended well. It was a tastebud party all night long.  There was another server named Andrew who was extraordinary and attentive. My boyfriend was pouring us more wine and he came up and asked if he could do it saying \"you're here tonight to relax and let us serve you!\" We felt so special and cared for the entire night. Best service I've had in a long time.  We ended the night with a surprise desert and sparkler that Andrew brought out for my boyfriend. It was a lovely touch. My only regret from the night was not being able to drink the delicious wine that Sam had specially picked out for my risotto. It was spectacular and complimented my meal perfectly. But I was already at my limit and unfortunately couldn't finish it. So, that's a personal apology to Sam and the wine...  Thank you Cafe Monarch for an unforgettable evening. We will definitely be returning again soon and recommending this to all our family and friends."}
{"text":"Food was very good but the seating and service did not work.  The indoor seating is limited and it seems as though all seats are right next to the door, which you will notice as the door opens and closes as the staff comes and goes every couple of minutes in their inefficient trips to the kitchen.  The staff was invasive, as they tried to remove our plates at least 3 times while we were still eating. We went for our anniversary, paid over $200 and were in and out of there in 50 minutes. It felt rushed and despite enjoying the food I can't imagine paying that much again for a rushed noisy meal when hoping for something more relaxing.  The outdoor seating is preferred by most patrons, but the night we went it was 50 degrees and we were told the outdoor seating was full. At that temperature I'd rather sit inside, but a tall bar style table next to the door carries no elegance.  The music indoors can be so loud that it will stop conversation, changes in volume can surprise you, quiet for a song or two and then a jazz song will queue up at a different volume level and make conversation across the table difficult for 5 minutes or so."}
{"text":"Yup, this place is amazing. Some of the most delicious food I've tasted. I'm not huge on alcohol but I had a delicious specialty cocktail with passion fruit and lime, it was so good. The meal was $250 for 2 people- we got the prix fix, plus 2 drinks and 2 desserts. That's pretty expensive. Good thing we had it in our restaurant budget this month :)"}
{"text":"Stunning Setting, Epic Fare & Amazing Service Charming settting, every course was better than the the last. I had never even heard of this place, and cannot tell you how excited I am that I had the opportunity to go. The setting was romantic, outdoor patio was insane, misters keeping it cool and just such a kickback vibe to the place. The food was as on point as it possibly could be. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a picky reviewer, so I don't give an establishment a 3 Star rating on a whim.  We read many glowing reviews of Cafe Monarch so we decided to give it a try.   Our first (more about that later) waiter was pleasant and took our order and my wife ordered the wine pairing. I don't drink so I just ordered soda.   She said specifically that she was not a fan of white wines and in particular did not like Pinot Noir or Sauvignon Blanc.  The waiter said he would avoid those.  She enjoyed the first wine and the first food course was very good.  So far so good.  While we were eating our second course, another waiter showed up at our table and brought the next wine.  He did not introduce himself and he seemed ill at ease.  He poured the wine which was a Pinot Noir, exactly what my wife said she did not like or want.  We didn't make a big issue and kept eating.  We weren't sure what was going on but it became apparent that for some reason, our waiters had been switched.  Our original waiter was waiting on other tables and we now had a new waiter, but as I mentioned there was no transition, introduction, or whatever.  It was awkward, especially for a restaurant of this caliber.  Later, while we were eating another course, the waiter brought another wine.  Guess what?  This one was a Sauvignon Blanc.  The second of the wines my wife specifically said she did not want.   Later, our original waiter stopped by as we were waiting for the check and my wife mentioned the problem about the wines.  Either there was no communication between the waiters or they just didn't care.  The waiter's comment was something along the lines of \"Well, yes, you said you didn't want the Pinot Noir or the Sauvignon Blanc, but these are such exquisite wines you just have to like them!  To me that translated to, \"Hey, these are the wines we have for the wine pairing and that's what you are going to get, and if you don't like these wonderful wines that we have decided to serve you, then there must be something wrong with you.  When the total bill for two people is almost $400 for a meal and one wine pairing (again, I don't drink), I find that totally unacceptable. As a side note, our first waiter asked me if he should keep the soda coming and I said yes but that didn't happen so I finally had to flag a waiter down after 20 minutes or so to get another soda when mine was empty and I even put the empty glass at the edge of the table as a hint.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"What a WONDERFUL experience!  Quaint, elegant ambiance. Excellent service and hospitality. Quality food. Beyond reasonable price!   $55 for 4 courses, which included a  fillet on my recent visit. The entree portion alone would've come close in price at other venues!   Only $25 for wine pairing, which comes close to 2.5 glasses (not counting the super generous Yelp check in offer of a free glass of house wine!), each of which was perfectly suited to match our course.  I can't wait to go back! Putting this on my \"top 5\"!   (And, it's going on the Steak Out list: Seriously, if there is a steak on the menu, I highly recommend at least someone at the table get it!)"}
{"text":"Imagine being invited over to dinner by a friend who's a gourmet chef. Your friend is a great host-- friendly and engaging, the setting is warm and welcoming-- an outdoor patio with trellises and a secret-nook feeling, and the food is divine-- full of flavor but never overpowering the main ingredients.   Well, that's what my friends and I experienced at Christopher's \"Cafe Monarch\" last night. From the moment I sat down, I forgot I was at a restaurant, and felt instead like Christopher had invited my friends and I over for dinner. He was a gracious host, and made sure all of our needs were met. The opening dish of grilled eggplant, buffalo mozzarella, pesto, and tomatoes really got my tastebuds going, and it didn't stop-- from the bonus dish of penne pasta in a creamy sauce with feta and chicken (which he shared with us as he was already making it for the group next to us), followed by pork tenderloin (the juiciest I've ever eaten!), and topped off by a dreamy dessert--  the sweetest strawberries with chocolate, bananas, and blackberry compote (you'll have to excuse me if I don't get the descriptions totally right-- I love food, but am not a total \"foodie\").  Anyway, I was just blown away by the whole experience. Christopher has it down perfectly-- and I am astounded that he does it all by himself. And I was amazed by how affordable this special experience this was! (Just make sure you bring cash- as I don't think Christopher takes credit cards)  Cafe Monarch is a magical place. It is obvious that this is the manifestation of Christopher's heart and soul! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The dining experience was amazing. It Is a four-course meal and every course was better than the next. Staff was very respectable and polite. I would definitely recommend anybody going there for a special occasion. I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Nice place, after tea for two, steak, and chicken entrees came to $200, that's including a $40 tip (most of the patrons I saw there would not need this detail, but for those who this is a special occasion, just giving an idea budget wise). Food was nice, not out of this world, fancy, but I knew going in the ambience (1) and quality service (2) is what I was paying for; food third. The important thing is that the wife liked it, that's what matters lol. There is a great steak house where we go in Chandler that has the traditional steak (larger portion sizes) and seared mushrooms that I like when ordering a filet mignon, this filet mignon was nice, but did not feel like there was much to it spice or pepper wise, nice, but plain for my taste (not especially memorable). Everything was good though, nothing was bad, I went mainly for my wife because she is from Europe and is particularly fond of snug and intimate restaurant settings- with the enchanting candle light decor. The staff was competent, polite, inviting, and knowledgeable. They kept our tea hot and filled it often. They used Stash tea, plus carried Stevia (bonus), which tasted great, the Chai tea had a particularly nice flavor. The green tea was plain, my wife kept taking my Chai tea :). We went for our anniversary, it was a nice winter night with adorning lantern lights, I switched seats with her so that she was close to the space heater. The staff was great about turning up the heat if someone asked. Any time one of us got up to use the washroom, when we came back our napkin was always re-folded neatly back to the table. One of my pet peeves with restaurant's is when I open a sweetener packet for tea or coffee and the server never takes away the trash, our server here was smart and picked up the paper debris quickly, to me this was a good sign of detail. There is only one bathroom for both men and women, which was a little odd for such a big/busy restaurant, so be prepared to wait in line. The bathroom looked nice inside, old world charm, rustic, candle lit as well with wood elements. The restaurant uses real wax candles, not the fake battery operated one's, nice touch,as well as the fresh flower on our table :). Overall if you want something pretty, intimate, cozy, and fancy for two people in the $200 (with tea) to $300+ (with wine) range, then this is your restaurant. If you are super hungry, this is not your restaurant, the food is a collection of the cute petite servings you see in the movies. My wife was full, but she eats very little usually. For a big guy you might want to have a light snack before coming. For a slim light eater, this restaurant is more than enough."}
{"text":"I'm another yelper who loved this place.  Frankly, I don't know how one could not love this place.  Everything from the gardens, the attractiveness from the outside to the magical setting inside renders the restaurant beautiful.  My wife wanted a special plate of vegetables for the main course and the chef came out personally to understand what she might like.  The food is really delicious with portions that are just right.  The starter which was a crab soup (more crab with a white corn sauce) was delectable.  The salad, first rate and delicious.  My daughter and I had the Ribeye and the Filet and shared.  Both were amazing but we preferred the Ribeye.  My only disappointment is the cost.  It's an A+ restaurant but comes at a A+ price.  For 2 adults and a teenage daughter having ordered two cocktails and the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu our meal cost us $350 after tip.  That's an expensive night out--which means this has to be a special occasion restaurant rather than one we go to every other week.  I would have preferred a lower price and more frequent visits--because it really is delicious."}
{"text":"We celebrated our 1st anniversary here. We let them know that in advanced and everyone that we came in to contact with knew what we were celebrating, it felt very special and was so appreciated. We arrived slightly early for our reservation and were seated in the porch area where we ordered a drink and were served a free appetizer. It was small, but wonderful. We were then taken to our table which was in the courtyard area, which was absolutely beautiful. The service was incredible and each course was impeccable. I think the first course, the roasted cauliflower soup, was our absolute favorite. One of the most amazing meals we have shared, and it all felt very special. We were also served a free dessert, which was some sort of custard or ice cream filled donut- we were quite full by this point, but it was much appreciated-  just wish we could have eaten more of it! It is quite expensive, but well worth it!   Thank you, Cafe Monach, for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Dining scene in Arizona has really came a long way!  Thank to restaurant like Monarch.  Great location, great service, tasty menu, and immaculate preparation of the food.  They did everything right.  Had great experience dinning here with my family!"}
{"text":"Double checked our bill...we had an 8 o'clock reservation, waited 10 minutes to sit down, and were given our check at 8:59. Four courses for $350 in less than an hour...super fast!"}
{"text":"There are restaurants that you visit to get some food..and then there are experiences that you will remember forever. Cafe Monarch is solidly in the latter category. There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said already.   They made our anniversary dinner so extremely special. The attention to detail was outstanding. I even went home with a little present! Typically in these type of restaurants, the ambiance and service outshine the food. However, that was not the case at Cafe Monarch.  I do not live in Scottsdale, but I will definitely come back for more!! Keep doing you, Monarch."}
{"text":"The four course chef's menu is fantastic from start to finish. I really enjoyed the thoughtfulness of the food and the flavor. The ambience has a touch of whimsy and so do the courses."}
{"text":"OMG! The food is beyond AMAZING.  Cauliflower soup, farmer salad and seafood risotto. Yum!!! And we did the wine pairing for our dinner and SAM was awesome! He picked the most exquisite wines to pair with our meal. Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Woohoo is right!  We've been coming here for a couple of years and came on Sat night for my birthday. Upon arrival find that Christopher has finished his renovations and had a beautiful new dining room and best of all, a new space on an outdoor patio, complete with fountain and heaters, where we elected to dine. As usual, the food was outstanding and service good. We do find however, that we miss talking with Christopher during the meal, but understand that it's just not possible with all the new tables. We wouldn't go anywhere else for a special occasion or just when you want a special & intimate place,  and great food. Too many times you pay too much for just okay food, so it's a treat to get great food for a fair price. Do yourself a favor and try Monarch Cafe.....you'll love it as much as we do.  Mike & Niki S."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, service, and food. Can't stress enough, the atmosphere is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to write my review of Café Monarch until the time was right. I cannot believe it has taken me this long to come here but this was one of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time. If you don't know, Café Monarch is a family owned and operated upscale dining establishment nestled in an unassuming Scottsdale neighborhood.  The restaurant itself has a very homey, intimate feel. We were lucky enough to get a table for two outside and the weather was incredible. The décor was simple and beautiful; you really did feel like you were in a secret garden.  The prix fixe menu changes constantly so you never know what you're going to get. For my first course I had the roasted cauliflower soup with truffle oil and pine nuts adding a delicate balance of flavor. Second course was a spring salad with compressed watermelon. Simple and beautifully presented. The third course was the lollipop lamb chop that was cooked perfectly medium rare and melted in your mouth. I opted for the cast iron filet mignon served with caramelized shallot butternut squash pave, crispy Brussel sprouts, with a beef jus emulsion. This was definitely one of the most memorable steaks I have ever had. Not only was the presentation on point but it was perfectly seared and tender.   As far as I know, Café Monarch is the only restaurant in Arizona whose servers are all trained sommeliers as well. This adds an excellent element of service to the entire dining experience as the wine paring is perfect. Our servers and their assistants were all so attentive without being overbearing. I cannot wait to be back and see what incredible food they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Great date night spot with intimate setting. The way they set up tables, far away enough from others, we enjoyed our conversation throughout dinner.  They have nice wine selection. They have options to pair with each dish but we chose to order a bottle instead. Unfortunately a bottle my date chose didn't quite work out. We both had a feeling it will take time but what we underestimated was how long it took before it became good. They transferred wine into decanter, but it took a long time for wine to become good. Around the time the main dish came, our wine started to taste where this wine should taste. They do have nice crystal wine glasses though..    They serve four course menu here. They had two options for the soup.  Soup was a bit too salty, we both didn't finish. Salad was very good, I especially enjoyed brussels sprouts. Flavor and texture was just right, I would have enjoyed larger portion of the salad. Nice presentation too with different colors.  Main dish was nicely done. I enjoyed my fish and his steak. Around this time, my wine tasted really good with oaky smell to it. When he looked at the menu, he knew I was going to order fish for my main dish so he chose this wine. It just took a long time.  Desert and service was just average. I enjoyed the ambiance more than anything."}
{"text":"Never given a restaurant 5 stars...until now. Incredible atmosphere,  service and the food was amazing.  No need to say anymore...if you can't figure out to go here from all the great reviews, this isn't a place for you."}
{"text":"Amazing place! All the rumors of this little gem are true. The menu changes, so you will never know what to expect. Do expect amazing drinks, food, and service. There are not many places in the Phoenix Valley that pull it off as well as this place!"}
{"text":"Found reviews for Cafe Monarch on Trip Advisor and Yelp and was looking for the best dinner in Phoenix.  This restaurant did not disappoint.  It is one of the top 10 dinners I have ever had.  Service, atmosphere and most importantly food was all impeccable.  The four course layout is perfect.  There are limited options in the course selections but there is easily options for anyone wanting to dine at this level.  Every dish was perfectly prepared and flavorful providing a dining experience equal to restaurants in New York and DC.  Event detail was covered down to even the table water which was a mint and cucumber water that was just right.  I had the paired wines that were well suited to the dishes.  When waiting for our courses the waiter gave me an extra pour of wine while we waited.  I had the Foie Gras which was an excellent addition to the perfectly prepared ribeye I had.  The waiter brought out the diver scallops as well which were awesome and demonstrated service and thought that was above beyond.  My wife went with the chicken which I would typically avoid at a restaurant but it too was unbelievable.  The atmosphere is romantic and perfectly executed and classy.  If you enjoy eating, and enjoy great service and environment this is the place to go in Phoenix, they do it all right."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a nice dinner and we were not disappointed. We were able to sit on the patio and the ambiance was amazing.   She started with the cauliflower soup and I the clam chowder. Both had great flavor. We also ordered a couple of the cocktails. They were very good.   Both main courses were so good that we hung around long enough to finish them. We wanted to order dessert, but were absolutely stuffed.   Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"From top to bottom this meal (and place) could not be more perfect. GREAT atmosphere, GREAT service, and the food was perfect. The price is high but what a great place for a special occasion (well worth it)."}
{"text":"I am not sure where to begin with this review. Everything about Cafe Monarch was perfect.  The ambiance was romantic.  An elegant rustic feel.  It was too hot to eat outside, but the outdoor dining looked beautiful.  Our server was friendly and attentive. Our meal was perfection from beginning to end.  My friend and I shared bites and her filet was one of the best I have ever tasted.  Tender, moist and perfectly prepared. Standouts for me were the Tuna Tartar and Halibut.  Chef Brandon is pure talent.  I was vacationing in Scottsdale and if I come back I most definitely will be going back to Cafe Monarch."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch party! All I can say is amazing! Everything from the ambiance, location, setting, service and food!! I'm from Cali and can't wait to come back to AZ to come again!   You taste the freshness and quality in every bite!! I can't wait to come back for more!!  I loved the sweet owner and her awesome son that made our experience unforgettable!   If your in AZ and you don't come here you def missing out"}
{"text":"Ate at Cafe Monarch Last Night:   All you Need to know:    Call Chris (the owner who takes the reservations personally) Now!! and confirm the first reservation they have, and go enjoy the best food and eating experience you have had or will have in Scottsdale.  If you are a 'foodie' , you will leave raving about the freshness, quality, creativity of the recipes and unmatched flavor of the food.  If you are not a 'foodie, you will either become one, or at the very least , leave lauding the chef's personal attention, the great waitstaff , cool vibe of dining in the kitchen or eating outside in the beautiful courtyard, and decor that makes you feel you are anywhere but Scottsdale.  If you are neither, than you should not have read this far, but should certainly give Cafe' Monarch a try, you will become both.  Thanks Chris for making me feel like a regular the first time there. I will be back and bring friends.   - James"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best meals I've enjoyed in years - each of the four courses was sublime, and the service was attentive, prompt and quite friendly.    Format is four course prix fixe; the price depends on what is selected for the fourth course (e.g., seafood, beef, etc.).  Even with a nut allergy that precludes some choices, the wait staff went above and beyond to ensure that what I did select would cause no harm.  Will definitely be back for future special occasions."}
{"text":"We had NYE reservations here and we picked the best spot in my opinion! This restaurant has such a beautiful dining atmosphere, it was in a courtyard area that was very beautiful. If you're looking for a romantic place, this is a great choice.  We had a tasting menu for NYE, everything was very good and well portioned out. The pace was very reasonable, the service was excellent with a very down to earth staff, and the food is cooked at a very high level. This is a lovey spot where I would love to go back and try more of their offerings."}
{"text":"A singular experience.  And I don't even live in Phoenix.  Based on the glowing Yelp reviews, I took my family (and a great Crozes Hermitage) there on our last night of vacation and we had a spectacular night.  Patio seating is magical, Chris is kind and a great chef.  The salad was amazing, fresh asparagus and cucumbers and straight from the garden tomatoes, feta and an olive oil that made me feel like I was in Italy.  We had given Chris specific dietary needs, and he followed the to a T, and still prepared two outstanding chicken dishes, one with a gruyere polenta and the other with black rice and a sweet and spice sauce.    Dessert was ridiculous, a very rich chocolate ganache and a very creamy tart.  All under the stars by candlelight.  The entire restaurant (4 tables worth?)  gave Chris a standing O.  He deserved it.  Go here for a very unusual and exceptional dining experience."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Every course of the tasting menu was amazing. Wine parings were spectacular and larger pours than expected. Larger food portions than expected. Wait staff was excellent. Bar staff was friendly. Overall amazing experience."}
{"text":"Everything that you've read about this restaurant is correct!  It's an amazing place which is very romantic, both indoors or the outdoor patio (it's worth waiting for a table to sit outdoors). If you're looking for an incredible dining experience with attentive service, this is the place to go. Each item we were served was so delicious and had distinctive tastes. Splurge the calories and get the flourless chocolate cake for dessert, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go, you must make reservations! The ambiance is great and the music adds to the complete feel of this French themed restraunt. My wife and I have dined at a lot of restraunt's and this one is by far the best! If you want the best fine dining experience look no further, you will not be disappointed! Make sure you sit in the courtyard, it is beautiful."}
{"text":"As everyone before has stated, this is a place you must experience!  I randomly stumbled upon the yelp reviews for this place last year when I was searching for a byob Valentine's dinner, and I thought the concept of the restaurant was interesting.  Turns out the place had been booked for months, but I thought it was really awesome that Chris took the time to call me and extend a warm welcome for another occassion.  Fast forward a year.  A friend of mine from Boston was coming into town, and asked me if there was any place I had always wanted to try; I threw out the idea of giving this place a try and he agreed that it sounded wonderful.  Thankfully we were able to get reservations this time:)  I really like the idea that the place was byob; it's very hard to find places anymore that allow it.  We had a heck of a time finding the place, but once we did, we were pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant was very charming and welcoming.  I was actually taken aback by how small the restaurant was inside; I believe there were 10 of us in the place total.  The tables were pretty close to one another but it somehow worked; it never felt like we were on top of another table.  It was really a pleasure watching Chris at work; I couldn't believe that someone could work alone and  be so organized and efficient.  My friend called ahead to warn of his food allergies and Chris was more than willing to cater to his needs.  THE FOOD!!!!! Oh wow; incredible.  Oddly enough, my friend and I both agreed that our favorite dish of the night was the starter salad.  I believe it was an arugala salad with fresh made hummus, apple and squash.  The hummus was extraordinary, and I had never even thought it belonged in a salad.  Boy was I wrong. For our entree with both chose the fillet and they were both cooked to absolute perfection.  Every item of the plate had such incredible flavor.  Desert was also very good, although the cheese that was used was a little pungent for my taste; so I stuck to the glazed and powder sugar coated strawberries and his homemade cinnammon sticks (I'm sorry, I have no idea what they are actually called).   Overall we were incredibly satisfied!  The cost was very comparable to any fancy steak house you would visit, but this place was by far superior.  Anytime we had a question for Chris he was more than willing to answer; and at the end of the evening when we were the last to leave, he came over to the table and chatted with us:)  I would recommend this place to ANYONE!!!"}
{"text":"I'm worried I'm skewing my star profile by constantly rating restaurants I love, but I feel so much more motivated to review a place like this then some place mediocre.  I let them know that we were dining here for a recent engagement and WOW they did not disappoint.  We dined outside, and despite it being over 100 degrees it was not a shock to see most patrons dining outside.  The misters kept everything cool, and the garden atmosphere is both unique and romantic.  The fountain and the greenery add a special touch to a small street in Scottsdale.  The food was also fantastic and each course was fantastic.  They respected our food limitations but the meal was not lacking in any way.  We will definitely be back!  We loved Cafe Monarch, and hope others have the same experience!"}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant. I am only disappointed in the fact that I didn't know about it sooner! Went for lunch and was impressed. A new favorite!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went for a grown up night out. I love good food but don't always like to get all dolled up to enjoy good food. It was the perfect evening out. Completely unpretentious, its like going to a friend's house for dinner who is also an amazing cook. So, hands down 5 stars for atmospere. Now, onto the food:  1) chef/owner makes what he wants to make. Be ok with it and you won't be disappointed 2) three courses, prix fixe for $45/person plus $10 corkage. Byob cuz there's none at the restaurant (a great deal if you ask me) 3) make reservations! On the night that we were there, he had one seating-that's it. We felt very special as we watched Chris turn down several walk-ins. 4) what we ate:  Tomato soup with grilled cheese sandwich-the best tomato soup-EVER, perfect consistency, a nice garlic kick. Grilled pork tenderloin-my dish, very tasty, over bed of japanese black rice. So good! Scallops with bacon-lots of scallops, lots of bacon, good flavor Strawberry tart-remember-it's Feb in Arizona and I was having a hard time finding good strawberries. These were better than good.  Remember-the chef is the owner, the owner is the chef so if you call during lunch or dinner, chances are, he's cooking. We usually love trying new places and don't often repeat, but this one we will."}
{"text":"High end fixed menu restaurant. They have outdoor (with heating lamps) & indoor seating options. The decor, both indoor & outdoor, is nice. The service is very formal. They do accommodate vegetarians, but cannot always accommodate vegans - best to check with them a week prior before. We were happy with the dining, though the desert was boring - simply fruits & I believe gelato. After paying so much, I would have liked a more creative eggless vegetarian options, especially since we notified them early."}
{"text":"Go for it! Celebrated daughter's birthday on the patio which was a new experience for her having been born in MN in November. They provided a complementary sparkler dessert and gift to top off our meal. We all selected different entrées and commented we'd order the same again (but menu changes weekly) Service was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable; excellent but not exceptional with a minor communication snafu between seating person and waiter. Overall nice dining experience."}
{"text":"I had high expectations based on the reviews, but unfortunately they were not met.  Came for my birthday but they didn't ask (so I didn't tell) and there was nothing special done for us. We were seated inside at an awkward table by a window with another couple basically pressed against the glass on the other side. The inside was nice but I was left wondering if the courtyard was nicer as other people after us refused indoor seats and asked to wait for an outdoor seat. I never even got to see it. The décor was cloying - like what a little girl's idea of romance looks like. The music was some nice trance-ambient though and my husband liked his cocktail.  The food was pretty good, but not great.   The cauliflower soup was too rich and distracting. It was heavy on the truffle flavor like what people think expensive food should taste like, and the few pine nuts were too heavily smoked tasting. The cauliflower was buried.   The spring salad was the best dish of the night - well balanced. The tuna was also tasty (excellent quality), but they had to substitute some of the ingredients and I think we missed out.  For mains, we got the filet and the crispy chicken. The filet was well cooked but nothing special. The chicken was a big disappointment - the skin was not even CLOSE to crispy, the flavors were muddled and bland. We also added the scallops which were great quality and well cooked, but the accompanying mess of dried corn, overdone pancetta, and some southwestern chili flavors were close but ultimately missed the mark.   We skipped dessert and left pretty quickly."}
{"text":"My daughter took us here for the first time last night.  The ambiance, service, food, all were excellent. I've been to the best restaurants in Monte Carlo, Monaco (lived there), Paris, Brussels, Zurich, Amsterdam, some Michelin star restaurants, and this one is in their league.  I'm very fussy about eating fresh, quality, beautifully prepared and presented food.  Only one little thing, I found the service to be a little too fast for our liking, and one rest room.  We're used to going out in Europe to restaurants where it's normal to sit at a fine dining restaurant for 2 to 3 hours, to truly savor the food, atmosphere and company. The next time we will definitely mention it to our water. Also, the wooden chairs were hard and uncomfortable.   Otherwise I highly recommend this wonderful little treasure."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to visit Cafe Monarch about 2 months ago for a friend's birthday, and I can't wait to go back!  Tracy's review was right on the money when she described this place as being invited to your friend's house for a home cooked meal.  (If your friend was a fantastic chef and host!)  Don't forget to bring a nice bottle of wine to share, as this place is strictly BYOB.   Chris, while busy, was a fantastic host/chef and catered to our every need.  (Even tossing out our corking fee - Thx Chris!)  Be sure to make reservations well in advance, it fills up quick because the place is the size of your living room, but it is well worth any wait you may have.  Be warned though, going here is an all nite event - do not make plans for anything later in the evening!  (And if you do, you will be prepared to cancel them all at first bite -  it's that good!)   Overall, this place is simply gnat-tastic!  *wink*   ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Delightful...visit; now! 4 course prixe fixe good value for money. Accompanying wine flight a bit expensive though the white Tempranillo was a real, and unusual, treat."}
{"text":"Amazing. Perfect for a special occasion. Love the eating in a historic home feel and amazing tasting menu. Loved the service and I highly recommend..."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?! This place was absolutely amazing and definitely a must try! Café Monarch definitely got it right by combining full flavored, delicious dishes with a service experience above and beyond most restaurants these days. I believe the menu rotates weekly, and so far it has not disappointed. The set, multiple course menu helps alleviate the stress of choosing a meal.  This hidden gem is tucked away in Old Town Scottsdale and gives the perfect romantic ambience and exclusive feel. I would highly recommend this place for a date or just anyone looking to impress because this place definitely does the trick!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast! French Toast"}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch is one of the most romantic  and unique restaurant I have ever been to. The restaurant is filled with lit candles everywhere both inside and outside - If you can, try to sit outside in their courtyard. It is a oasis of ivy, candles, and stars right above that inspires the imagery of the secret garden. They have heaters almost at at 1:2 table ratio so it's easy to stay warm despite the winter season.   The food is incredible. It is priced at $65/person for a 4 course meal + $30/person for wine tasting. The menu changes week to week but during my visit, I had sweet potato bisque, a fresh winter salad, filet mignon, and a rum cake. I was pleased with the wine pairings - the sommelier was clearly gifted in his trade and did a great job in enhancing the already perfect meal.   The service (our waiter: Bradley) is attentive but not overbearing - there wasn't a point during the meal that I needed to wave someone over. We had to wait a few minutes for our table, but the beautiful patio and cocktail menu made the time go by quickly. The owner was lovely and checked on us regularly. She apologized for the wait and made sure we had the best table in the courtyard.   This restaurant is really something special and I would recommend this place over and over again."}
{"text":"What a truly amazing dining experience. One of the most romantic restaurants I have ever been too. I came here with a colleague and we were surrounded by couples celebrating birthdays and anniversaries with the signature sparkler dessert.   Upon arrival we were told our table wasn't ready yet - instead of standing around waiting in a bar we were directed to a table on the front patio and were served complimentary appetizers and delicious cocktails. What is this magical fairytale land? Twinkle lights, fresh flowers, candles, all the attention to detail. I had the Conquistador cocktail with vodka, lime, strawberries, fresh basil and ginger beer - so good. The appetizer was a bruschetta with brie and caramelized brussel sprout leaves - I would have been satisfied with just that.   But then we were escorted to the outdoor dining patio - covered in twinkle lights with roses at each table. The four course menu started with a lobster bisque, followed by a salad, and a foie gras wellington. For the main course I had the crispy chicken that was perfectly moist and juicy on the inside. Dessert was not included but we couldn't leave at this point without it. I had a decadent warm chocolate cake and a frothy foamy cappuccino.   The service was impeccable - always there refilling water, folding your napkin if you got up from the table. The bathroom was just a continuation on the adorable cottage decor. I felt like I was in a Beatrix Potter story.   And the prices weren't bad - not compared to what we've become accustomed to in LA."}
{"text":"Yelp needs to change their rating system so we can give cafe monarch the credit it is due. Six stars for atmosphere, food, wine list, service, and did I mention atmosphere! My hubby and I don't dine out like this all the time so it was a special treat to indulge and add all the extras as well (extra course and wine pairings were well worth it). This place is special, a one of a kind experience and my new favorite in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The best place in Scottsdale hands down. I am an avid foodie and guarantee every one a dining experience you will talk about days and years later!  Excellent quality and use of ingredients. The restaurant is so unpretentious with a staff who are very knowledgeable and take their craft seriously."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to Monarch to celebrate my birthday last night and we were both completely blown away. The food is phenomenal and the service is like nothing I've ever experienced. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I planned a surprise party last week and it could not have turned out better! Every other place I called wanted a large deposit and could not accommodate 20+ people. The owners, Phil and his brother, helped me with arranging for the cake delivery and setting everything up. The venue was great and the food was even better! Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"I had been hearing about the glorious dining experience at Cafe Monarch for years but never made it there to have lunch or dinner.  Yesterday some friends came into town and I chose Cafe Monarch as an unique dining experience for them.  And we were not disappointed!  Everything was wonderful from the open air enclosed patio dining to the subtly lit candles that were used to light up the back patio area to"}
{"text":"May not have tried the food, but the phone service is less than OK.  Tried to make a reservation 3 weeks in advance and the request was, \"I'd rather you make sure you can make it then make the reservation and then cancel.  I mean, are you just trying to book it as a safeguard?\"   Would have loved to experience the 5 star reviews since I'm flying in from NY, but uhm, no thanks.  And people say New Yorkers are rude."}
{"text":"My husband stumbled upon this spot while in old towne Scottsdale and said he had found a place I was going to love. He promptly made reservations and we went on a Thursday night. The atmosphere was low-key which was exactly what the doctor ordered and our meal did not disappoint.  I am in the design field and let me say that though the food was the star attraction, the decor of the place was amazing too. The owner did the interior himself. Impressive. We are hooked."}
{"text":"We found ourselves at this quaint, extremely charming restaurant called Cafe Monarch in downtown Scottsdale. Had we done more research, (I was tired...) we may have learned that it is one of the most highly touted restaurants in the area and one seldom gets in without a reservation. Here we are, under-dressed, with no reservation, but delightfully greeted at the door with a bit of hesitation; the staff surely wondering if we are prepared for a dining experience such as this. Ha! They didn't know who they were dealing with...  I will outline our meal and tell you all about the details of the exquisite menu that we selected from. However, I would be remiss if I didn't begin by telling you that it was one of the most incredible meals I have ever had with nary a miss on any dish. The service was also exemplary as one would expect from this level of dining.  Our meal began with a Roasted Cauliflower Soup - white truffle oil, crispy prosciutto and Gruyere grissini. Some chefs balk at the continued use of truffle oil. I haven't jumped on that bandwagon as I still love the truffle flavor and if it is done right - as this surely was, it offers a hint of flavor that elevates the dish ever so delicately!  Our next course was an Autumn Salad - local micro salad mix, charred brussels sprouts, candied applewood bacon, toasted pepitas, couscous, poblano, heirloom baby tomatoes, dried currants, crispy corn, Calabrian chili-garlic confit and a basil buttermilk dressing. Wow, all of that in this little salad. Each bite, an explosion of flavor with such an interesting mix of ingredients and a unique composition. Yep, loved it!  Next up; Anson Mills Shrimp & Grits - persimmon chutney, roasted pasilla peppers,  and micro cilantro. A little sweet, a little hot, a little creamy - I like it a lot!  My main was their Cast Iron Seared Filet Mignon - Niman Ranch USDA prime beef, sunchoke puree, sautéed haricot verts, wild mushroom medley, charred cipollini onion, roasted fingerling potatoes, banyuls-beef jus emulsion. I love the fact that this filet mignon was cooked ever so perfectly and the execution of each and every vegetable or sauce was done with exact precision.  It's not over yet! Ok, so I did say something about being ok with just soup & salad for dinner, but now that we've gone this far - why stop now? We must finish this fabulous meal off with a bite of sweet. Suggested as the best in the house was their Rum Cake - pecan butterscotch, vanilla bean gelato and chantilly creme. Yes, it was as good as it looks, minus the shadows in my photo. A great end to a magnificent meal. One might think this is a once in a lifetime experience, and for many that might be what it is. However, for me, I can't wait to get back and try their new season's menu!"}
{"text":"I took my mother here for Mother's Day (I apologize for the late review), and it was fabulous. Everything here gets 5 stars because of the customer service, atmosphere, food, wine, and more! This restaurant is a lovely experience and a great way to try new creative dishes. My mother and I decided to order so that we could try each dish from the prefixed menu, and nothing disappointed. Our waiter (and the other employees we talked to or passed) were charming and knowledgeable about the menu and wine. I'm a huge wine fan and appreciated that the staff was educated and informative about this. Cafe Monarch is definitely a treat for anyone wanting to try something unique in the valley. Take someone you love (friend, partner, family member) and sit back and enjoy an evening on their quaint patio with the overhead string lighting brightening your entire evening."}
{"text":"The atmosphere on the back patio is like being in another world. It's romantic, cozy, and beautiful. Even the bathroom had a great ambience!! The food and service were equally as impressive. We will be coming here for dinner every time we vacation in Scottsdale from now on."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I gave a restaurant five stars- everything really has to come together.  The five stars rating is based on two visits six weeks apart.    Initially after my first visit I though that perhaps it was the perfect spring Arizona weather, fluffy clouds, light breeze, the sunset sky with orange and purple hues that made the out door ambiance magical.  Our next visit in the throws of the summer heat was just as magical.    The hostesses greeted us warmly on both occasions as did most of the staff as we walked towards our outdoor seats.  Nothing in Phoenix, and I mean nothing, compares to the outdoor seating here. The candles, the trees, the shrubbery, the eclectic music, the misters, the hidden nook and crannies with hidden seating-everything just works.   The menu is essentially fixed with a few choices of salads and main meals.  The wine list is excellent.  Service is spot on and not intrusive. The price point is high but well worth it.    The food obviously is star as my photos will attest to.  I can not wait for my third visit."}
{"text":"This dining experience brought us back to nights in Italy; truly a diamond in the rough experience. We were asked upon entering if we preferred to eat indoors or out -the indoors looked inviting and warm but as soon as we saw the tree and hanging light lined patio the choice was immediate (would not have been so much if the option had been outdoors overlooking the parking lot where some guests were seated).   After being seated, our waitstaff was friendly and attentive, pointing out we could either opt for the paired wine option with our meals or choose from the wine/cocktail list which all four members of my party selected to do.  All selections, except the main course - which consisted of  meat, seafood or pasta -were pre-set and did not disappoint in the least although my friend's husband felt the butternut-squash ginger soup - with maple glazed prosciutto garnished with pumpkin seeds - was a bit on the sweet side.  This was followed by a locally produced arugula and beet salad with blue cheese and plum prior to our main courses. Our companions devoured their seafood selections and my husband and I our filet mignon, cooked to perfection medium-rare as ordered.  The meal was topped off by dark rum cake with toasted pecan butterscotch, just the right proportion.  We'd have liked to have been offered beverages to accompany dessert, however, once we asked our waiter for our choices they were promptly delivered although my first pot of tea was lukewarm and had to be replaced, with a reminder to bring a fresh cup.  Still, such an oversight did not detract from our overall enjoyment of the evening. If not for the rather high price of the evening, we'd be back sooner rather than later -- but we will definitely return."}
{"text":"4.5 stars Started out with perhaps the best soup of my life (corn with lobster).  Then the caprese style salad was good but was hoping for more flavor from the tomatoes my cheese.  The filet was incredibly tender but lacking flavor. Finally the carrot cake dessert was delicious. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I think it is worth coming here just for the ambiance. Honestly one of the best dining environments I have eaten in. And definitely romantic.   Service is super super friendly. Unfortunately, there were some big holes in the actual service. But it is impressive to have an entire team of people this warm.   Food was good, not great. Same with the wine pairing.   But let's be honest, if the food and service were perfect then I would have to move to Arizona just to have date night here."}
{"text":"We went for a special occasion dinner and were blown away. The patio is beautiful like out of a movie set. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable and efficient. The food was absolutely incredible!! The craft cocktails all looked amazing, I had one (which was enough!) that was outstanding. There was not a thing I could complain about, suggest differently, or didn't love. I am a foodie, happy to try new things, my husband is a lot pickier & has food allergies. They never missed a beat!! We were both incredibly pleased. Can't wait for an occasion to bring others!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Where do I start? I was looking for a special place to spend my girlfriends birthday and needless to say, I found it. She's pretty well traveled so I wanted to find something that would take us out of \"Arizona\" instead of the usual Maestros or Sam Fox concept which I love but I wanted something more unique and special. I love the pre-fix menu options because I'm super picky and it forced me to try new things, she's the opposite so she loved it all. The patio was something out of a Hollywood movie set from a romantic movie but still cool enough to be able to enjoy dinner with the fellas. The candles all around made the ambiance righteous, I couldn't help but feel like we were in another country. Each of the four courses was simply amazing. Each plate was perfect in size and the presentation was bar none. The staff and owner were fantastic. We loved every moment there. Thank you for such a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"SOO good. I don't give out 5 stars too often but this place really hit the mark for everything - great food, atmosphere, and service.   Let's start with the food - $75 for a 4 course meal (creamy cauliflower soup with bacon drizzled with white truffle oil, ahi tartare, arugula salad with smoked goat cheese hibiscus reduction and pomegranate,  and a beautiful thick piece of Chilean sea bass that was crispy on the top and melt in your mouth everywhere else).   Gorgeous outdoor seating surrounded by vegetation and candlelight. A beautiful romantic oasis. Definitely worth the money and visit. Wonderfully professional, attentive, and welcoming staff. Perfect evening with the girls!!"}
{"text":"One of the most unique dining experiences in Phoenix and around. I, for a moment forgot that I was actually in Phoenix.   It's a perfect place to celebrate an occasion . I was giving a surprise to my friend and they do this birthday thing with an amazing dessert and a sparkler.  The moment I entered the place, I was in awe of it, it was romantic yet so easy and casual.  The service was just extra ordinary, never did I see the glass half empty with water. They took care of so many things in such a subtle way. We were having a great time and we never thought we needed anything else. It looked so much like Europe to me TBH.  The thoughtfulness around food is amazing. The roasted cauliflower was the best thing I tasted ever. Each course was so  well thought off and unique in its own way. The flavours and combinations were so dynamic. Definitely recommend this place. A little pricey but well worth it with the experience you get out of it.  I'm ready to go back here in a second.    P.S Do request for a courtyard seating . It Is mind blowing."}
{"text":"Wow! What a treat! The dinner was incredible, atmosphere outstanding and service wonderful. It is a true Scottsdale gem. Very romantic and personalized service at a reasonable price...what more can you ask for! Our waiter Christian was delightful.  The evening was priceless:)"}
{"text":"Wow. Did brunch today, as opposed to dinner from the previous review.  Outstanding. 3 little waffles with fresh berries and a lemon-pistachio butter(?). Best waffles I've ever had. Light and crispy on the outside. And not just \"fluffy\" on the inside. More unique - almost like a popover texture in the middle. Not overly sweet, just the crispy, moist waffles with natural sweetness from the berries and a handmade syrup from fruit.  Then a whole nother course: scrambled eggs on top of melting gouda, next to toast with pesto and artichoke hearts, bacon and chicken breast stuffed with sausage.  Either one of these courses could have been my whole brunch. But I couldn't resist eating both. Thank god we rode bikes there and back, and then rode again later to dinner with friends in the hood.  And great news! Smokehouse Sunday is theoretically starting next Sunday at 11am. (for future reference: this review is from Oct 2008)"}
{"text":"Went their Friday night for our anniversary. We were greeted promptly and wished a Happy Anniversary. Seated right away in the courtyard. Was a little apprehensive about eating outside given the temperature. But the mist system keep it cool.  Sam our waiter was extraordinary. Very attentive wished a us a happy Anniversary as well he was engaged in the service alll evening making u feel special.  The food always was outstanding. The steak and scallops were excellent.  Try a specialty drink very refreshing.  Yes it is pricey but the experience is priceless   It's our go to place for special events"}
{"text":"OMG! I am so proud  to see someone in today's world, take pride in ownership of putting together such a classy and upscale restaurant in my home town of Scottsdale AZ!  Cafe Monarch is nestled in Old Town Scottsdale on the west side of Scottsdale RD off 1st Ave. The food for one thing is absolutely divine! We ordered from the fixed menu in which we had sea bass and a filet.I can't praise  this place enough about the food & the ambiance. They do not buy nor serve frozen fish and meats! Everything is fresh and so perfectly presented on your plate you will think it is a work of art!  The  service is impeccable! I heard a man from North Dakota owns the place and his son runs it. I don't know the owner nor the staff personally, so this review is real! Make reservations because I am not the only one obviously that has found out about this great eatery! Busy place. Worth the wait if you have to wait for a table. The prices are a little high  but not bad considering the value and exquisite service and food. They have a great wine list!  Make this a great 'date' destination! It's a sexy place!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I did not check out the whole restaurant because we literally was seated in the front right next to the door.  The noise level was quiet and calm, ambiance was enchanting and charming, and the service was just ok.  The server was not as attentive as I would like, but he was friendly.  We had to ask him for more waters a few times and tell him we were ready to order after waiting for at least 20 minutes.    You definitely will be spending a pretty penny (probably around $60-80/person).  The menu is extremely limited.  You get to pick one out of two options for an entree.  You are served soup first which was quite tasty.  Then a salad - watermelon, cheese, and arugula (I think).  It was pretty delectable.  I decided to order the salmon as opposed to the ribeye.  The salmon was really scrumptious.  I enjoyed every bite of it.  Then on to the dessert. Dessert was mediocre - whip cream, strawberries, and some kind of crisp wafer.    All in all, it was excellent, but I would save the visit and $$ for special occasions."}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch was hands down the best restaurant I've ever been to! Not only was the food phenomenal but the service was even more impeccable! Such a beautiful location for a birthday or anniversary (or in my case both ;P). So in love with this restaurant concept and can't wait to return for our next special occasion!"}
{"text":"Went here for our Anniversary and had an exceptional meal. Their wine list was a bit pricey but still a great evening."}
{"text":"The food was very good! I had the cauliflower soup and Seabass. Both were good; the cauliflower soup was amazing, one of the best I've ever had. I ate at the quaint old location across the street, the original spot in the patio and it was really cool liked it a lot"}
{"text":"We were debating on whether we wanted to deal with the special occasion factor of a restaurant or just wanted some great food. This place was incredible. The ambiance was perfect and fun, the wait staff extremely good, and most of all the food was on point. Would 100% recommend."}
{"text":"Well I'm impressed! I've been to Cafe Monarch in Scottsdale now 3 times since it's relaunch under the guise of Christian Lewkowicz and chef Andy Nienke, each time more pleased than the last. The menu changes daily for dinner they offer an amuse bouche, salad, main course, and a dessert as their pre-fixe offerings. With only limited seating, you must call in advance. There is nothing more magical than dinner in the candlelit courtyard garden, which is where 'my' table is located. Last night I was treated to an amazing experience that I've come to know, if not expect from this talented duo. The amuse bouche was a tartare on a slightly toasted incredibly fresh baguette with a simple piece of raw red onion. \"Heaven\" The salad was a deconstructed caprese with heirloom tomatoes marinated in truffle oil over some of the freshest mozzarella I've ever tasted.  Entree choices were slow braised short ribs or grilled shrimp over polenta. My dining companion chose the short ribs, and absolutely loved them.  After a taste, I totally agreed with him. They were melt in your mouth tender, and so juicy and succulent. I chose the shrimp. I know you're thinking grilled shrimp? Yes, grilled shrimp. 8 large perfectly cooked shrimp over the most tasty polenta all topped with a delightful sweet/sour reduction that tied the textures and favors together like...well, like, The Millionaire Matchmaker was involved!  Each course is perfectly sized so that you can enjoy the flavors and not be overwhelmed with the taste. I know you know what I mean. You sit there beautiful meal presented to you, a huge portion of it, and you feel obligated to eat it. Don't deny the truth we've all been there!!!  The final course of the evening was a light and creamy ice cream, house made of course, bits of chewy, gooey chocolate cake and very slightly sweetened whipped cream, all with fresh sliced strawberries.  I'm not a huge dessert person, but the portion was just right for me.  Just a couple of bites is all I typically have, and that is what it was...just the perfect final bites to a fantastic meal.  Do not forget they also prepare lunch on Thursday, Friday, and Saturdays with the same choice pre-fixe menu.   Please do yourself a huge favor and get to Cafe Monarch as soon as you can. I can not wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It has a great patio and a constant change in the menu with wine pairings that suit the meal perfectly. Every time I go, I leave happy and recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"I judge restaurants not only by their food but also the service and the experience in dining at that particular restaurant.  The food was fabulous at the Monarch Cafe, the rear patio setting was just out of Tuscany and the service was excellent. Our waiter Scott really made the evening for us.  The took what appeared to be a 4 plex apartment building and converted it into a restaurant. It is a gem of a place with plenty of on-site parking. We had a wonderful meal there."}
{"text":"I would say Café Monarch has reached its full potential with the new location. The service is truly outstanding and now the property is as well! There were no fewer than five people sharing duties to entertain us with our meal last night. Everyone was superb and their spirits were high. The cocktails were perfect. The food was superb. The ambience was fabulous.  For me, this is a special occasion restaurant. You can't be faint of wallet when going here.  The prices are high, but here you get what you pay for.  They are also extremely accommodating. My wife and I split meals, with me getting about 2/3 of it. That was fine with them and we enjoyed the four course dinner between the two of us.  Since the menu changes constantly, I won't get into the details of every course. Except to say that each course was magnificent! The flavors were just outstanding!  If you haven't been, go! If you haven't been since they moved, go back!"}
{"text":"First off, I feel bad giving this place just three stars. After reading all the reviews, I was really hoping to like it a lot more than I did. I've heard for months from friends and fellow yelpers about how awesome this place is, so we decided to give it a try for early Vday dinner.   The atmosphere is very very nice. Nice little cottage with a kitchen (where they have a few tables next to the chef), a dining area, and an outside patio area. There are lots of candles and can be romantic place. The waiters were all nice, but we had some issues with the service. A group of 4 that came 20mins later than us(just 2) sat next to our table and kept getting food quicker than us. The most annoying part was that the waiters kept telling us our food would come, but the speed and service was definitely lacking.   As for the food, it was definitely worth 3+ stars except for the main chicken pesto dish. It was just two butterflied chicken pieces with pesto sauce, no vegetables, no special sauce, nothing special. I did love the appetizer 1 (white bean soup with side of bread with asiago cheese), appetizer 2 (barley and poached shrimp w/ sweet asian chili sauce), and one of the main dishes (pork tenderloin with a sweet chutney/hint of curry sauce and asparagus). The dessert was just some strawberries and fudge brownie. Again, nothing special.  All in all, I did like the experience, but the food left me thinking there could have been more or that it could have been better. Maybe I went in thinking too highly of this place. I am willing to give it another try, but it's not #1 that I would recommend to a friend.  ** I wanted to add something. Chris, the owner of the restaurant sent me an apology via email and phone call. This says a lot considering chefs will get very offended if you talk remotely bad about their food/creations. I have to admit. I feel bad if I seem very cruel in my review, but I feel that I was not over-exaggerating anything. I like to think that I speak the truth and hopefully readers can appreciate that. One last thing.. Chris pointed out to me that the chicken pesto had provolone cheese and spinach. I am sorry Chris, I have a dull palate.   Again, i would like to try cafe monarch again and will update on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Second visit here for dinner.   Fantastic meal.  Four courses were amazing.  Greatly enjoyed the tomahawk pork chop. I also did the wine paring with the meal-- it was well worth it.  Service was great.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp I was able to find this hidden jewel.  The place looks like a spanish style motel converted into a restaurant.  With a cute garden in the back.  I had already eaten so didn't intend on a 2nd breakfast.  But stingy GF only allowed me a few bites so I had to ask Chris to whip up  another plate for me.   It was my first time having chilled salmon done that way and it was so good.  Everything tasted so fresh.   For the price you get to drink all you want.  And I must have had at least 10 glasses of the orange juice with mixed berries.   The food and the atmosphere reminds me of eating in Napa, CA.   Will definitely return when I'm in town."}
{"text":"WOW!!  Incredible experience!  We travel with a group all over the country and are fairly jaded when it comes to restaurants who claim excellence. This place was so outstanding that we don't know where to begin. How completely wonderful!!!  Sam was outstanding!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place, made a reservation at the last minute so we didn't get to sit on the patio. The place is intimate and warm and inviting. It's a Prixe fix menu every course was great, I almost don't want to post this because it may get too busy. I dine out a lot and this was one of best meals I've had in a long time, I would give it a 6th star but yelp wouldn't let me."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for sure! The atmosphere is romantic the food is amazing and the service is just right. For a romantic quiet get away from the crowded trendy chain restaurants, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Idk what else to say but bravo. This place is a gem .... And I'm glad it's hidden. Food is so so so amazing. Service and garden seating is so delightful. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We visited Cafe Monarch on a recent trip to Scottsdale after reading such positive reviews. Once we saw the menu for the week, we were sold! We started with a butternut squash soup, then had some kind of fried polenta and greens salad, followed by filet mignon and flourless chocolate cake. I'm not sure how they do it, but the creativity of each dish and the thought that went into marrying all of the flavors and textures was impeccable. My husband and I both agreed, it was the BEST meal we've ever had.  We had a 5:30 reservation and were seated in the courtyard, which after our experience, is the only way to go! Simply beautiful with great ambiance. We would definitely return to Cafe Monarch!"}
{"text":"Pretty much best restaurant in Scottsdale. I've been here 23 years and have eaten at many places old and new. This one is hands down excellent in every area, hence it's consistent high rating. Not sure what else to say, except that it's worth the price."}
{"text":"This is such a wonderful restaurant!  The patio is beautiful, the food is amazing. Every course was delicious. The wine pairings are very well thought out and unique.   One of the best restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had the cowboy steak and sea bass with lobster and scallop add-ons...  All were cooked perfectly...   High quality food and service...  Well done, Cafe Monarch."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, fabulous food! Chef Chris is fantastic! We brought a friend here from out of town & was the best dining experience ever!  Can't wait to go back! Make sure to call weeks in advance & BYOB - Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Why would I come to your place again. The first time is humiliating enough to be ask to leave right after dessert is served.   I think your clarification was incorrect. As soon as dessert was cleared, we we were asked to leave. As I stated in 30 years of dining I never encountered such rudeness.  We  paid closed to $800 dollars for dinner.   The other people didn't want to sit outside. What make you think we wanted to sit outside? There were Mosquitos outside!  Please be nice. Don't treat us by the color of our skin! The world need more love and less hatred."}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch was amazing! From the moment we got there we knew it was going to be a great dining experience. We were greeted kindly and were seated in the outside patio. It was beautiful! So romantic! The food was divine. So tasty! I got the sea bass and I must say it was the best I've ever had! The service was top of the line they make you feel special. I would definitely recommend this restaurant especially for a special occasion. Next time I'm in Scottsdale I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"the food here was very good. liked the service. loved the flavored teas."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a culinary delight. It's amazing decor with personal touches by owner Sofia and Chef husband are worthy of a Michelin star! Great for special occasions or romantic date. We are lucky to have this gem in Scottsdale and highly recommend to everybody!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband for my birthday celebration weekend and this was one of the places I had chosen for our Saturday night dinner as my actual birthday was on Sunday. OMG. This place is breathtaking. You have to make reservations if you want to come here and you have to request the outdoor seating as it was like a fairytale atmosphere. I mean I was blown away by the outdoor decor, it truly was a magical experience. They also really make you feel special. Honestly, one of the most beautiful restaurant experiences I've ever had and I've eaten all around the world. This will always be memorable for me.  This is a pre fix menu which isn't always my favorite. I have to say I loved 90% of everything brought out including the squash soup, their salad. A few other appetizers were just okay for me but nothing was horrible. The stand out of the night was my filet mignon as the server told us their cows get the royal treatment and you could tell. The meat just melted in your mouth and it was one of the better filets I've had for sure.   They knew it was my birthday so they brought out a little birthday treat (complimentary) with a sparkler that blew out, it was just beautiful and hats off to the staff for making everyone feel special at a place like this. They also gave me a little trinket to take home which I thought was also very sweet. This was definitely an experience I will never forget and not only for the delicious food, outstanding service but mostly for that magical, one of a kind atmosphere. So happy the weather was perfect for us to sit outside. Would love to return someday again!"}
{"text":"Good food cooked perfectly, with A+ service. This is a pre fixe menu with a few choices for two or more courses. The menu changes every couple weeks, so it's always a different experience when you come for dinner.  Richard took great care of us, this is the second time we've been fortunate enough to have him serve us. I couldn't ask for better service, better timing between courses, or ambiance. The patio is gorgeous.   This is one of my favorite fancy places in Scottsdale to eat. I can't recommend this place highly enough. Great date place."}
{"text":"So, somehow, I had never heard of this place. I can't even recall how I stumbled onto it. Probably when Googling something like, \"top places in Arizona that make you feel like you're dining in the movie 'The Secret Garden'\". Or something like that.  This place is spec.tac.u.lar (said like Kevin Spacey from American Beauty).  My friend and I just kinda went on a whim on a Thursday night, not knowing what to expect. I didn't realize the menu was prix fixe, but the hostess quickly filled us in on the details - $45 for a 3-course meal. Salad, entree, and dessert. Fine by us. We were greeted by extremely friendly staff and a delightful little patio, lit up by soft lighting and actual candles. Not that fake fire plastic cheesy bullshit. We were seated by a little fountain at a small table with a chair on one end, and then a 2-person couch on the other. Clearly meant for some type of romantic snuggling. A few minutes later, the owner, Christian, came by to chat with us a bit about the history of the place. He was very friendly and sincere.  Our server took our beverage orders and I said something along the lines of, \"I dunno, gimme something fruity. No cucumbers\". He brought back something perfect for both of us, and they were SKRONG drinks. I was already giggling like a schoolgirl. Luckily, the eggplant salad came out quickly after to soak up some of that alcohol. It was super unique; filled with diced tomatoes, olives, chunks of eggplant and a bunch of other tasty stuff neatly placed on a bed of greens. Oh, I should mention, their menu changes daily, so you get something unique every time you go. Not sure if it changes for lunch/brunch, but for dinner it does. The salad and dessert are the same, but you have 2 choices for entrees. It makes ordering very simple. My friend had the short ribs and I had the shrimp polenta. Our entrees followed quickly after the salad, both looking and tasting delightful. I honestly don't know what the Hell polenta is, but it was yummy. Everything was so fresh and simple, and being a bit of a cheap, uncultured person, I appreciate things that are simple. I had a bite of the short ribs as well - tender AF. Lastly, our desert came out. Simple as well. Just a lovely brownie with some ice cream and wait...HOD UP. Is this brownie toffee!?? Yes, it was a toffee brownie. I tried to be polite and take adorable girly bites, but fuck it. I ate that thing in like 5 seconds. Afterward, the chef himself stopped by to get our feedback on the food. He was a character. Funny, friendly guy who unfortunately told us he was moving back to San Diego in a month. But I'm sure whoever replaces him will be just as badass. I would expect nothing less at this point.  So after 2 drinks and a 3-course meal, I'd say yeah. We were pretty satisfied. Our bill came to about $120 total. Not what we had intended on spending, but certainly worth every penny. This place is really great for a romantic evening, a special occasion, and definitely a wedding. I haven't been for brunch or lunch yet, they've been booked up the past couple of Sundays sadly. But I can't wait to try it and write a novel on how I feel about it for your reading pleasure.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, LOVEEEEE!   The menu changes weekly and all the food is locally grown. Amen to that!   I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and even though the prices were a bit high, every bite was well worth the price. Because there were two of us we got 1 of each course (there were two options for courses 1-3) and a variety selection for our entree. Everything was perfectly paired, and was so delicious!!!! Even though it's a 4 course dinner, we were perfectly timed when delivering a new course and removing the current course. I was also very happy that the portions were not undersized. We did overeat because we couldn't put our forks down, but I would LOVE to go back and I'll be a customer for life. The Rum Cake is apparently what they are known for and I could eat it all day, too! One of the best meals we've had in Arizona!"}
{"text":"The chef promised three choices for entree...there were two...salmon which was fair and short ribs..a cheaper cut of meat. The tables were too small...not enough room for dishes, glasses and a wine bottle.. the desert promised was bread pudding...but a cobbler was presented. Corkage of $10 per bottle, but glasses were not exchanged from red to white wine. The Chef asked about the meal but did not listen for a response...I will not go back"}
{"text":"From the moment we stepped up to this little hidden gem (with the welcoming twinkling lights on the patio) to the moment we grudgingly departed, we were enchanted. The ambiance was incredibly romantic with an old world feeling...loved the french music! The service was outstanding in spite of how busy they were, and my husband said he had the best filet of his life! My halibut melted in my mouth. My favorite part, which was quite surprising, was when we were first seated in the front outdoor patio area. The attendant offered us a generous portion of complimentary steak skewers and tuna tartar. Will put this place at the top of my list!"}
{"text":"Perfection at its best! Simply exquisite & exquisitely memorable! My husband and I came here to celebrate my birthday & it left me speechless. The atmosphere was quaint & charming~ the bathroom was marvelous- I could have stayed in there and just gone exploring. From start to finish, I could not stop saying, \"Yummm.\" From the roasted pine nuts cauliflower soup to the rum cake- oh, heavenly. Christian, our food connoisseur was so amazingly attentive. Towards the end, I was given a birthday present- a beautifully wrapped jewelry trinket box. The birthday rum cake with vanilla bean ice cream just blew my mind! The cake was so moist & full of flavor that left you wanting more. I mean, I loved it so much that Christian gave me 2 more to take home (which I ate for breakfast)! I will be eating at this fine restaurant more regularly now that I have discovered a piece of heaven in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the pleasure of dining here for our  4th anniversary. We were greeted by everyone and it was sweet that ALL staff congratulated us the entire night!!! The food was delicious and perfectly prepared! We informed our server that we were in a rush unfortunately and needed to make it to Gammage for the amazing Hamilton Broadway. Needless to say our courses were delivered in a timely manner. Due to our schedule we skipped the dessert but the restaurant gave us a special anniversary gift before we left, a gorgeous jewelry box!!   Thank you to everyone at Cafe Monarch. We're excited to return very soon!"}
{"text":"An absolutely amazing restaurant. My family and I went here last year to celebrate my mom's birthday. Everything from the food, to the service, to the ambiance was outstanding. I have dined at many well reviewed restaurants in Scottsdale, and this restaurant is by far my favorite. Monarch is a must try!"}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch lives up to the hype. The courtyard is a perfectly romantic setting, the food is divine, the service is solid, and the price is well within reason for the experience you get. I will be regularly checking the ever evolving menu and coming back as much as I reasonably can. This is an oasis in the desert, I can't believe I waited so long to try it."}
{"text":"A fantastic meal in a fantastic location with exceptional service. In fact, the service was almost too good. Our only \"criticism\", if you can call it criticism, is that the pace was too fast. We hardly had time to finish our course that our plates were whisked away and the next course in front of us. We could have appreciated just a little more time to linger over this mouthwatering, exquisite meal. Thank you Cafe Monarch for being part of our wonderful , romantic, wedding anniversary celebration!"}
{"text":"A treat! A perfect evening. The ambiance is from a movie. Imagine the most romantic candle lit courtyard from a storybook. Chef selection begins with three courses timed wonderfully. Each building upon the next in preparation for the entrée. Wine pairing is top of the vine. I selected chicken. We enjoyed filet and sea bass as well. The menu descriptions are perfect and a must read. I can't do it justice. All I can say is enjoy the perfect dining experience. 5 stars plus! I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Never disappoint. Surpassed our expectation again the 2nd time around. Will definitely come back for more. Thank you for such a great night and  a souvenir, the wine topper sure will be out to use..see you next time."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Scottsdale as it's romantic, the service is top notch, and the food is always consistently amazing. Molly and I had a business dinner here several months ago and they sat us outside on their patio which was just perfect. The only problem with Cafe Monarch is that we don't go there enough for our date nights! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"There are no words to express the pure heaven and masterpiece that is the food at this establishment. I cannot eat here often enough, there aren't enough days in the year! Every menu item is haute couture on a plate! The staff who have all been the same for a year (when I first discovered it) are the definition of service excellence. The decor and the incredible courtyard are a work of art! Expect to pay top dollar, the courses are predetermined other than the main which you choose from several (all breathtaking) options. Definitely add the Scallops to your meal, and the drinks list is divine. If this business was a person, I'd marry it, and this review doesn't begin to do it justice."}
{"text":"We just returned from a second long weekend trip to Scottsdale in February (a chance to get out of the St. Louis winter).      A highlight of both trips has been a chance to eat at Cafe Monarch.   The decor is almost unbelievable.  We've never taken so many pictures inside a restaurant.  During our first meal there, 3 people in our party actually took pictures of the decor in their bathrooms...and only later did we admit it to each other and laugh that their bathrooms were so fancy it was worth a quick photograph :)  This last trip the service was impeccable and the meal was excellent.  I personally had the Lobster Bisque, Sea Prawn, and Citrus Encrusted Chilean Sea Bass.   Every time we've been here we've paired our meal with the wine flight.  During other pre-fix meals with wine flight pairings we've found the pours to be very small.   Here they serve full glasses which are paired very well with the serving.     I can't recommend the locale, meal, and service enough.  I would check their menu online to prepare yourself for the price.   That said, we have found it worth every penny and are discussing our next trip to Scottsdale and meal at Monarch already."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. From the server who sings opera to Sam the sommelier to the bus boys everyone here cares about your experience and make every moment you have at Monarch amazing and they aren't even the best part. The food, I could write a sonnet about how the flavors dance on your taste buds. The courses all flow perfectly together on a fashion that leads you full, satisfied but wishing you had more room for the next dish. This little slice of heaven is what you wish you could find in the culinary capitals of the world, but we are so happy to find it in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Impeccable service, delicious food, exquisite wine. The meal (and ambiance) is set up to be very European/Old World. As such, our meal was a true experience and lasted about 2 hours. They did ask us if we had somewhere to go, in which case they could speed up the courses, but I would recommend taking it slow and savoring the entire meal. Each course was beautifully presented, unique, delicious. They don't include the vegetarian options on the menu but those were absolutely delicious as well, not an afterthought like at many places. The servers were knowledgable and went above and beyond to answer questions we had about the wine and food. They even were able to talk to us about different regions in France and their wines. Extremely professional, a truly romantic and classy experience. Menu changes frequently so we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am extremely glad I got to partake in such an exciting dining experience with a group of friends at this restaurant during my trip to AZ. Loved the fact that you inform the chef of any food allergies or preferences in advance and you will get a unique menu of the day determined by the chef. I am still amazed at how this restaurant was only run by a one man team that evening, owner/chef/everything...Chris was amazing and he was very friendly, accommodating, and even took the time to chat with us.   We came with a group of 10. so you can imagine how many food preferences we had and how difficult it may have been to whip up a full blown meal for us. The food was amazing!   - Baked pesto chicken pasta was alright (initially a little undercooked, but it was re-cooked and brought out perfectly crispy on the edges).  - Spinach salad with yellow and red grape tomatoes: delicious and flavorful.  - BBQ rib/pork w/fingerling potatoes: There was a nice little kick to the sauce.  - Marscapone waffle with fresh berries: This was my favorite, crispy warm waffle with just the right amount of sweetness from the marcapone and berry sauce. Divine!   Good food, great environment, and a wonderful way to catch up with friends and the fact of not know what dish would be next/taste was a nice little conversation starter for everyone. I am intrigued to come back and see what type of different dishes would be served. I definitely recommend checking this restaurant out.   P.S. Reservations required and CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"One of the best and most memorable meals we've ever had in all our travels. Both my husband and I dislike onions, garlic and scallions -- and the creative and accommodating chef cheerfully and creatively adjusted all four courses of the chefs menu to accommodate us.   Great ambience. Excellent knowledgeable and energetic (yet unobtrusive) waiter, outstanding service. We really Look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Scottsdale or Phoenix...One of the best in the US. I should not be writing this review because it will make it much harder for us to get reservations, but, Cafe Monarch deserves so much praise for the quality of its food, its ambiance, and the amazing chef and family who own the establishment. The food is absolutely terrific, highest quality and incredible preparations. The menu is unique, you have a choice of two different entrees each evening, and the appetizer, salad and dessert are part of the meal...the price is an excellent value. Their wine selections are unique, all excellent. We went with friends who were wine experts, they did not recognize many of the selections, but found some great offerings. It was fun to find small vineyard offerings and discover new wines. The dining areas are intimate, we especially love eating in the outside area, a garden setting where you are transported to someplace lush and secluded..You would never know you are in downtown Scottsdale. What more can I say?"}
{"text":"It has been several weeks since our trip to Phoenix and I thought it was finally time to write a review of Café Monarch. Chef Chris, sorry it took so long but I have been slammed at work which is typically where I do my best Yelping :)  Café Monarch is one of the most unique, and delicious, dining experiences we have ever partaken. We lived in Phoenix for many years and Café Monarch was on the top of our list to try before moving to Dallas. Sadly, we discovered that the restaurant is closed in the summer time and we missed our window of opportunity before leaving for the Big D. As we planned our trip back to the Valley of the Sun for this past March, we knew which restaurant topped our list of \"Must Haves\" while on vacation.  Upon our arrival to the restaurant, Chef Chris greeted us from behind the cooking station. He notified us that our table was out on the patio and that he had the special menu requests of the other two members of our party. The staff that night notified us of that night's menu, for both the carnivores and pescatarians of the group, and was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. We made our menu selections for the evening which included an appetizer of prosciutto and pesto on a toasted baguette with a salad of fennel and green apples, a main course of roasted pork loin and black rice topped with a sweet chili sauce, and a homemade angel food cake with fresh fruit. Everything was superb. The fennel and apple salad was very unique and the pork was cooked perfectly (I hate dried out pork).  What was most interesting about this experience is that Chef Chris takes the time to speak with his guests. Dining at Café Monarch is more like eating a meal at someones home rather than going to a restaurant. Chef Chris is an artist and a remarkable host. He wants each guest to leave feeling satisfied with not only the meal but the overall experience. We talked about everything from food, to running a small business, to Yelp. Chris cares about the opinion people have of Café Monarch and goes to great lengths to be sure people have a great experience. He even showed us the new dining room which should be opening soon.  The price of the meal was what you would expect form a fine dining experience. Actually, it is pretty reasonable for 5 stars especially since it is BYOB.  Café Monarch was worth the wait. I wish we had something similar in Dallas but we will just have to make Café Monarch a special treat whenever we are back in Phoenix.  Thank you for a fantastic evening!"}
{"text":"I don't ever write reviews, but this place is highly exceptional. The food, the staff, the setting, everything was beautiful. It's a bit pricey but you're paying to be pampered and the food is out of this world good. The filet mignon was the best I ever had and the potato fingers soaked in duck fat was outrageous. My lovely girlfriend had the Portobello lasagna which upon looking at we had no idea what it was, but it was sensational. We want to thank you so much for a very lovely evening."}
{"text":"From the waiting area to the final table in the courtyard The Monarch was an intimate and super romantic experience. The candles, lighting, and decor set the stage for what is about to give your mouth a taste explosion. With the help of the servers you'll be guaranteed to eat and drink one if the best meals you could wish for."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Unique Dining Experience, this is the place!  Cute atmosphere but the food is some of the best I have ever had. I love that there is no menu and you get what you get. I make enough decisions every day and it just feels good to let the experts handle it!   The three course dinner was so amazing I took photos! The only thing I would love to see is chairs the are more comfortable. But hey when the food is so good the hard chairs don't seem like such a big deal.   Great job Chef Christopher!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! I have nothing but great things to say. If you're looking for a restaurant for a special occasion, or you just are in the mood for terrific food, you really need to put Cafe Monarch on the top of your list."}
{"text":"Café Monarch is unlike any other dining establishment in the valley, other reviews have compared it to a secret garden and frankly that couldn't be a more appropriate comparison.  The atmosphere here is simply breathtaking.  It's the perfect location for anyone looking for a special intimate evening.  The sound of the water fountain, the flickering of the candle light, the beautiful and lush landscape is something out of a fairytale.   From my experience with most restaurants is that they either have a beautiful atmosphere or good food, rarely do you find both.  This is not the case here; this family owned and operated restaurant prides itself on offering diners the best dining experience possible. With a menu that changes weekly, they are able to offer diners a delicious meal that consists of fresh, organic, all natural seasonal ingredients. Owner Christian Lewkowicz is so passionate about offering diners such a well rounded experience, that He and all of his servers are currently training to become sommelier's, which as far as I know Café Monarch will be the only restaurant in the Valley with such training. Because the menu is always evolving, and the attention to detail; it's the perfect spot for anyone who considers themselves a foodie!   The particular evening that I dined there, We arrived a few minutes early.. So we sat outside and had a cocktail while we waited for our table to be ready.  I ordered the El Diablo which has Olmeca Altos Silver Tequila, Gran Marnier, Watermelon Fresca, Muddled Jalapeno, fresh lime, fresh lemon with a sugar-chili rim. It was delicious and I love that all of the ingredients were fresh, I highly recommend ordering it.   Once seated inside the restaurant - our server came by the table and explained what that evening's menu options were.  Never once throughout the entire meal did I feel rushed. Our server was friendly, engaging, well educated on the menu and wines offered and very discreet.    We were started off with a delicious amuse bouche of Steelhead pate with crispy wontons, It was delicious and a perfect way to start the meal.   The second course was an arugula salad with feta and red quinoa -  the portion was huge and the salad was perfectly balanced. I ordered the wine pairing with the meal, which I highly recommend. All of the wines offered on the pairing menu are not available on their regular wine list. The salad was paired with a beautiful French white Lorie wine by Domanie Du Lobard. It was the perfect pairing to the salad course, light and crisp with a little fruitiness.   For my entree I got the Sautéed Chilean Sea Bass, Crab-Edamame-Saffron Risotto, Petite Shaved Fennel-Onion Salad, Vanilla Bean-Lemon Beurre Blanc. I LOVE Chilean Sea Bass and it may have been the best sea bass I have had. The real stand out of the entire meal and a must have were the Seared \"Diver\" Scallops with Baby Spinach and Bourbon-Shallot Sauce which is well worth the $20.00 additional charge.  The entrée was paired with a Greek wine Skouras Saint George Nemea.  I wasn't expecting a red wine to be a good pairing to the Sea Bass, but it complimented the flavors perfectly.   The desert was a shortbread with fresh berries which was paired with a delicious  Prosecco.   I thoroughly enjoyed my entire evening at Café Monarch and can't wait to dine here again in the future. For the quality of food and the price point ($65.00/pp and $30.00 for wine pairing) it will be apart of my regular rotation!"}
{"text":"We just loved everything about this restaurant! The atmosphere is so charming both inside and out. The service was excellent and the food couldn't have been better. The portions were just right and the menu was really creative. I'm so glad we got to experience with very special place and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a truly unique dining experience."}
{"text":"We were visiting from NY celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary.   They gave us prosecco to start and a complimentary dessert and gift to end.  And the in between was just fabulous.  The salmon carpaccio was perfect with capers.   The soft shell crab was tasty and just enough before our entrees of sea bass and filet mignon.   The filet was cooked medium rare and to absolute perfection.  Better than a steak house. Sea bass was delicious as well.  And the ambience was so romantic and inviting.  We truly felt like we were the only ones dining."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations of Cafe Monarch as we have heard great things. Everything from service, ambiance and decor was excellent.  Every dish blew our mind as far as quality, freshness, balance, flavor and how well it was cooked.  In fact this was probably the best meal we have had in Arizona as far as I can remember."}
{"text":"Wow, this restaurant is amazing!  My fiancé and I live in Chicago and were in Phoenix for the weekend visiting my Grandpa and had a night to ourselves so we decided to head over to Scottsdale to try this place out.  It was so fantastic.  We sat outdoors in the back patio and it was beautiful.  There are candles in lanterns everywhere, the walls are covered in vines, it is so perfect.  Everything about this place is beautiful and peaceful, from the design and the table settings to the music and the presentation of the food.  The menu changes weekly but while we were there we had a white asparagus soup, a watermelon salad, a filet with mashed cauliflower, and a flourless chocolate cake.  We also ordered the wine pairing and a drink before dinner, we got this really cool drink on the menu that our server suggested which is like a margarita but it's served in a bowl, on fire, and it's for two people to share.  The wine pairings were excellent, the meal comes with three wines, the first one was a bubbly moscato, the second was a merlot blend, and the third was a bubbling pinot noir which was so fantastic.  I had never had a bubbly pinot noir before, it was fantastic!  The service was great, our server was excellent, we had such a perfect evening.  If we are ever in the area again we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Café Monarch is a culinary experience. Unlike any other and absolutely extraordinary.   We sat inside, I think in the \"kitchen area\" where you can watch the chef/owner create his masterpieces. It was really cool to watch the owner perform his magic and to watch the joy he got out of cooking. The food had so much flavor and the way he incorporated the different ingredients amazed me, some of the ingredients didn't sound like they would taste good, but somehow they worked together and our taste buds exploded. Absolutely delicious! Café Monarch is also very accommodating, if you have allergies or you're a vegan (something along those lines!) he will gladly make the meal to fit your needs (just make sure to call ahead, especially if you're with a big party).   We didn't dine on the patio because it was like 30 degrees outside (Christmas time), but the patio is really awesome. It's really romantic and charming and next time I go there, I will make sure to enjoy the patio.   If you're a foodie and you love tasting new, exciting food, you HAVE to try this place. It is an experience you will never forget. Simply wonderful.   5 Stars for atmosphere, service and of course the FOOD!"}
{"text":"There's a reason this is one of the top rated restaurants in the Valley.  Everything about this place is impeccable.    To start, the ambiance is very cozy and romantic.  We dined on the patio, and I felt like we had been transported to a villa in Italy.  Lights hung up above, beautiful garden surroundings...you feel special in a set up like this.  Our server, Sam, truly took us on a magical journey.  We opted to do the wine pairing with each food course, and Sam not only brought out fantastic wines to drink, but he talked to us about each wine, and why it compliments each dish.  We found out that he is also the sommelier at the restaurant, and his knowledge and passion for the wines really shined through and made us even more excited and enamored with our dining experience.  And the food; holy cow the food!!  Every course was truly special.  Their menu changes weekly, and we had the pleasure to enjoy many fantastic dishes. One dish in particular (the filet mignon) was highly recommended by our server Sam, and I am so glad he told us that because it was one of the best filet's I've ever eaten!  I 100% recommend coming to Cafe Monarch for a romantic, beautiful meal.  It was truly one of those food experiences that I will cherish for many years to come. :)"}
{"text":"Exquisite. Having lived in California the last 7 years, I'm disappointed with Arizona's lack of quality restaurants. People rave over Sam Fox concepts and similar chefs, which wouldn't last long in Cali. This place however is legit.  When you can make a soup and a salad that knocks your socks off, just wait until you get into the main courses. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So this one is hard to review because the menu changes weekly however I was immensely impressed by the wine list and cauliflower soup.  The front of house has done a great job with ambience balancing how big this restaurant is while still making it feel cozy."}
{"text":"Beautiful building, perfect for a romantic date. Service is attentive, friendly, and professional. Food is high quality. The menu is based on a four course dinner and you pick your options for each course."}
{"text":"Double Woohoo!  When Adonis wants to take Aphrodite out for Valentine's Day and they happen to be vacationing in Scottsdale (?) this is absolutely where he'd take her.  First off, their adobe courtyard is a stunner. Take a look at the pix~! Olympianly romantic. So if you want to impress your honey with rustic elegance you've found the golden apple of restaurants.  The dinner format is great, too. Three set courses followed by your choice of entre. We loved everything served: soup (the truffled cauliflower with beet chip and pinon garnish was about the best soup I've ever tasted . . . anywhere . . . anytime), salad and appetizer/small plate (a wonderful tempura tiger prawn with an amazing tomato chili jam) were all the same for each diner. You then had your choice of entre with a slightly variable price. Every dish was simply superb. Superb, as in memorably and unusually delicious.  Dessert rocked (my favorite = the rum cake, my sweetheart's was the flourless chocolate cake), as did the service. All in all, one of the top 10 meals I can remember having anywhere around the world. And that's a lot to say.  Sign me, David \"Your faithful subject\" M.  P.S. Helpful hint--Because you don't get to choose your first 3 courses, be sure to check out their menu on-line before going to make sure everything you're going to get is something you'll like and/or be able to eat. If that's not true, then have the smarts to call beforehand and make arrangements for an alternative dish so both you and the restaurant won't be placed in an uncomfortable position as the dinner progresses."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an absolutely beautiful exquisite meal at Café Monarch for a 27th wedding anniversary. By far this is been one of my greatest experiences in dining in Arizona!"}
{"text":"WOW. To date, the best restaurant we have been to in the scottsdale area!  Very complex flavors and impeccable service with the every server having an excellent knowledge of the wine pairings.   This is a fine dining experience so please respect the restaurant and dress the part!  It's a nice night out  A word of warning:  if you do the complete wine pairing, plan on using a car service!  They do not pour a small glass!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous experience in romantic courtyard with twinkly lights.  Great service and amazing food, wine from start to finish. Highly recommended special date night spot with great attention to detail and friendly staff. One of the best dinner experiences in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Be aware, this isn't like regular restaurants, the menu is based on current fresh foods that are available. We hit Monarch for Sunday brunch and all 5 in our party loved their food and.....we all shared as well. All of it was excellent!"}
{"text":"After my review I haven't signed on to yelp for a very long time only to notice that chef/owner had personally wrote me a sincere message regarding my experience, and although I have not yet returned to Monarch (since its closed in the summer) I'm truly touched by the thoughtfulness and gesture of owner/chef to make the overall experience better."}
{"text":"Very happy with my experience here!  Stopped by on a Wednesday evening (which is apparently a new night for them as they were only open Thurs - Sun) and were able to be seated immediately.  In fact, it was pretty empty.  The courtyard area is very cozy / romantic / beautiful.  I love the atmosphere!  The starter (squash with burrata and other yummy things) was delicious!!!  For the main, I chose the fish (choices were between fish and pork) and it was good - not great.  I still ate it all, but I've had better.  The dessert was also very good.  Overall, it was a great meal and experience.  I liked only having to decide on my main and wine.  The \"host\" seemed very passionate and knowledgeable about the food and was very friendly.  (I think we offended him when one person from our table asked for salt - which isn't a negative thing, it just shows their passion / confidence in their food!)."}
{"text":"The food was as amazing as the atmosphere!  Beautiful garden tucked away with the perfect music playing and plenty of misters for summer dining.  My new favorite!!"}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars. I first dined at Café Monarch over a year and a half ago, and was swept off my feet.  It was a beautiful weekend afternoon, and Chef Christopher charmed our minds and our bellies into utter heaven.  I went two subsequent times each with less star-power than the former.  I have not yelped it because on that first occasion Christopher brought up in conversation his aversion to reviews, even mentioning \"Yelp,\" because he was trying to keep things quiet, organic, special, unique, which I can respect.  But it seems that has changed based on all these reviews and his yelper shout-out regarding potential employees, so I'd like to add my experiences. First time: * Salmon cakes bursting with fresh fish, capers, bright lemon.  Plump and amazing.  Sitting on a bed of dijon-laced frisee.  * French Toast made with this thick, amazing brioche, perfectly drenched is real maple syrup.  Sugary crust on the outside, warm soft deliciousness inside.   * A gigantic, gigantic, gigantic, plate of perfect bacon cooked in a high-heat cast iron skillet.  I still fantasize about this bacon. It was a perfect day. $50 pp and worth it.  Second Time: * Thanksgiving.  It was a buffet.  The amount of work and care that went into each dish was evident.  The turkey was smoked, the potatoes sweet with hints of tumeric & cinnamon, lovely local organic veggies, chunky sausage stuffing- basically all the fixin's gourmet-syle.  Unfortunately they seemed to have been sitting out for a long while, because the temperature of the food was cool and it was on its very last leg.  It was droopy food.  We chalked it up to it being a Holiday. $50 pp and semi-worth it.  Third time: * If this had been the only time I went I would not go back.  We raved about it to some friends and brought them one Saturday night to share the heaven.  Brought some amazing grapes and sat back to let this chef work his magic.  No starters, apps, or salads, just one small dish of gorgonzola pasta for 4 people to share.  The pasta was good, fairly well-executed but all 4 of us were still very hungry.   We were embarrassed at how much had we glorified it to our friends.   $50 pp and not worth it."}
{"text":"Now for a great review. My friends came here a little while ago and just kept going on and on of how amazing this place was. My husband and I decided to try it for our anniversary dinner. Talk about luxury. We had a nice table for 2, they set it up nicely, and there was no wait when we got there. (Mainly because we made a reservation)! My husband and I both loved it. Please come here for anniversary dinners or just come here for fun! (Just if you have kids probably don't bring them because they have big compact meals that may not be the best for kids!)"}
{"text":"In summary, one of the best meals and experiences in our lives.  We have had the privilege of traveling and visiting some of the nation's top restaurants, and I have worked in the wine industry (both at winery and restaurant ends) for years, so this praise is not handed out lightly.  Stepping out of the car in front of the unique building that houses Cafe Monarch, we knew this would be different. The prior reviews ramped up our expectations.  We were greeted at the large gate by the hostess lighting two large heart shaped candelabra and ushered into the large courtyard with a beautiful fountain - feeling special already. Stepped inside to the most amazing and unique architecture - seemingly in old world Tuscany - and taking in all of the details.   We were seated at the window viewing the fountain, at a table adorned with tulips and a candle, under a gorgeous chandelier hanging from the hand painted, domed ceiling...now if the service and food can live up to the atmosphere...  The menu is four courses - a choice between two or three dishes for course one, two and three (these are small, but large enough to share) and then a fourth \"main\" course which determines the price of your meal. You can choose to have a course-by-course wine pairing for an additional fee (I would recommend putting yourself in the somm's hands here). Dessert provides closure.  Our server/sommelier Sam came over asked about us, what we liked, and told us a little about the evolution of the Cafe. We elected to have Sam pair wines with our courses and act as our guide. His cheer, and knowledge of food and beverage - coupled with the staff's flawless service, made this a magical night. All we could do is say \"wow\" and wish this was not 3/4 of the way across the country.   We enjoyed the best clam chowder ever for course #1, paired with a Savart Blanc de Noirs Champagne. Sam selected an Italian white, Graci Etna Bianco, to pair with a fresh Dungeoness crab \"salad\", essentially crab in a leaf of bib lettuce with toasted Pepitas, Avocado and Dill Crema. The crab was so fresh, it tasted like it just came out of Bodega Bay.  Our third, a tuna tartare served over crisped rice \"cracker\" (not a real cracker), drizzled with a chili aioli was out of this world, dazzled when paired with a Trimbach Alsacian Riesling.  My wife and I diverged for our main course - she went with the duck and I went with the beef, paired with a Tor Grenache from CA (winemaker Jeff Ames is a friend) and an Italian Ornellia Le Serre Nuovo Rosso, respectively. Both hit the mark, and the duck/grenache pairing was nirvana (talking goosebumps).  Dessert with an Alvarez Sherry sealed the deal.  If you visiting the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, this is a must for a dinner. If you live in the area - lucky you.  PS - Sam - good luck on your Master's exam!"}
{"text":"This is a phenomenal restaurant in Scottsdale, I am so thankful my best friend found it! The menu changes weekly to reflect the best seasonal ingredients so that always keeps things exciting.i don't even know how to explain the interior, quaint, and almost like a cabin with lots of vintage chandeliers, mirrors, paintings and more, it is beautiful. Everything about the interior was perfect. My friend and I selected halibut and filet as our entrees. Each were outstanding in their own ways. The filet had a perfect sear and was wonderfully tender on the inside. The halibut had a number of flavor layers that went together well. We thoroughly enjoyed each course. The price is very reasonable, a $65 prix fixe plus alcohol. We were also honored to meet the chef Brandon on our way out. Definitely make this a stop if in the area."}
{"text":"Just perfect! The little garden outside is amazing, beautiful And charming, candles And Palm trees. The food was gréât: à menu Of 4 courses meal (without desert) for 65$ or 75$ Service perfect Delicious, healthy portions, refined! Really worth it!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for my birthday. Truly an amazing and passionate staff, who went above and beyond for me. Food was so good."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and experience! I went here for dinner last night and truly had a wonderful time. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was very romantic and relaxed. Christopher, the Chef & Owner, was also the server, bus boy, host and manager. He did it all and did it perfectly.   When I made the reservation he called me back to find out what kind of food we preferred and to find out if we had any food allergies. I told him seafood and beef and that we weren't picky eaters. He had a delicious shrimp and asparagus dish for me and a pork tenderloin in a beef and smoked chipotle bbq sauce for my boyfriend. Both were excellent! He even asked me what herbs I liked to prepare my shrimp entree with. Never been asked that before!  Our reservations was at 7:30pm and we didn't leave until 10pm. It was a long and very nice evening. The price for a three course dinner was $40pp and then $10 for the corkage fee. I don't know where else you can get a meal of this quality for the price.   It is officially one of my favorite restaurant's in the Valley and can't wait to return. Next time will be for the brunch I keep reading about. It'll be the perfect way to spend a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I enjoyed a romantic fantastic meal. It was our first time to Café Monarch and we will definitely be going back. The filet mignon was sensational and they have a terrific wine selection. We highly recommend the patio and the staff service is superb."}
{"text":"We road tripped across the country this holiday season, and were smart enough to stop by Cafe Monarch. Hands down, it was the best meal of our entire trip. The food was phenomenal, of course, but so were all the cocktails and dessert. One of the best things about the family-owned restaurant though is it's able to evoke a sense of timelessness that allows you to come in, sit down and just take your time with everything--the person you're with, the dishes you're about to enjoy, and really be present in the moment. It's a little desert oasis that's been curated to perfection."}
{"text":"Best food in the valley and was always my favorite restaurant. Service was extremely slow from our waiter, the only time he said more than 3 words to us was when he dropped off the check. We had to flag multiple other people for our drinks and missing food items.  This was my first visit during the summer and I was sadly disappointed. It was slow service and extremely hot! We were sat directly by the door and the staff went in and out every few minutes. The indoor portion of the restaurant felt hotter than the outside. Food was amazing as usual but we rushed to get out because we were so hot. We've learned our lesson, come only in the winter."}
{"text":"Cute little cozy eatery serving up what's the best and freshest at the moment.  From the hand-written menu outside to the picturesque garden exterior, Cafe Monarch is a little gem in the heart of downtown Scottsdale.  It was a lovely late Saturday morning when we ate here, right at opening time (11 AM).  The menu for lunch is all $12.50 no matter what you get, with selections such as pork tenderloin, chicken breast, shrimp, and brie with fennel.  The last two selections are what my friend and I had.  The shrimp was excellent.  It was perfectly cooked, on crispy toasted bread covered with pesto.  There were also pieces of sweet pineapple, sliced cherry tomatoes, and chopped onion to add some more color and tropical flavor.  There was a massive amount of shrimp on the plate, which made this dish a tasty and very good deal.  My friend had the brie with fennel and puff pastry (My description of this, by the way, does not do the dish justice).  All the ingredients were well prepared and very good on their own, but for me, it wasn't as good as my shrimp dish.    Drink selections include hot tea, coffee, and iced green or hibiscus tea ($3).  The hibiscus tea is very refreshing with a deep garnet color to the drink.    Our total for 2 lunch dishes and 1 iced tea was a little over $30 including tax.  This establishment is cash only, so come prepared!  P.S.  Another plus about this restaurant.  For those of you who hate scavenging for restaurant parking around downtown Scottsdale, Cafe Monarch has its own private lot."}
{"text":"The BEST and most ROMANTIC restaurant ever.  The courtyard was mostly lit with candles - I cannot describe how beautiful it is.  You will have to see for yourself.  Very light easy-listening music playing in the background (not blaring and obtrusive like a lot of restaurants),  Our waiter was Steven and he was delightful.  We also had a young man that cleared plates and was kind enough to take our photo.  So the staff was courteous and prompt and discreet. They saw that we were enjoying ourselves and  did not disturb at all.  Some places try to hustle patrons in and out quickly.  The food was amazing.  The menu changes often so I can only comment on what we had:  Roasted Cauliflower Soup - I didn't think it sounded that good, but it was delicious.  Light and creamy and heavenly.  Salad (not sure of the exact title) but the candied bacon was over the moon.  Then a giant prawn - another winner.  My boyfriend had the Chilean Sea Bass and it was buttery and luscious. I had the filet and it was cooked exactly right.  We also had the rum cake for dessert - oh my goodness.  I wish I had a larger vocabulary to describe just how fantastic the food was.  We both had a glass of Malbec and it was spectacular - very, very smooth.  If you go to Scottsdale with your  significant other please do yourself a favor and make reservations for this place.  It is pricey, but so worth it."}
{"text":"Ranked number 1 as the most romantic restaurant of the country (based on data gathered through yelp apparently) - my husband and I came to Cafe Monarch to celebrate a belated V-day.   I've been spoiled by endless Michelin star restaurants and countless ridiculously priced fine dining - although Cafe Monarch didn't top my fav list, it def broke into my top 5. From ambiance to service to food, every category was beaming 5 stars across the board.  Soup, salad, steak, fish - whatever you order, be prepared to be wowed! Every course was thought out and explained to fine details. Every dish was meticulously put together and beautifully presented. I honestly loved every component of my dishes (a smear of a sauce, a shred of greens), every bite was heavenly. The time lapsed between each course was just right. Our 4 courses plus their complimentary dessert only took about 90 mins from start to finish.   Menu changes every two weeks so no point of my going into details. The only change I wish to see is for them to offer bread service. I was surprised that a fine dining restaurant like this didn't offer it. But then again the 4 course meal is probably more than enough to satisfy most stomach (just not mine).   Overall - who can give less than 5?"}
{"text":"5 stars service Simple menu course with various meat selections such as chicken, beef, pork, and fish Vegetarian dish  Overall, I really like the service and food. For me, food was little salty. That would be the only issue.  For price, it is expensive but compare to any other high-end restaurant food course, it is NOT expensive"}
{"text":"Outdoor garden, fixed menu,  Not BYOB anymore"}
{"text":"This is by far, without question, one of the best places I have ever been.   They have fantastic, well thought-out menu items and with the menu changing weekly, so much fun to try and try again. The food is always to die for and the outdoor patio is simply stunning.   Love this place."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant!  Our waiter, Chris, was one of the best waiters I've ever had.  He was very friendly, and made it a great dining experience.  We started with the Kamboucha Cauliflower soup.  It was incredible!  The soup was creamy and the bread they give with it was out of this world.  For the next course we each got the winter salad which was also outstanding.  The braised pork belly in there was delicious and the rest of the ingredients blended nicely together.  I would highly recommend both.  For the third course, we were a bit disappointed.  My brother got the Duck Breast (advised by our waiter) and I got the bolognese.  Compared to the first two courses which were booming with flavor we just did not find the duck it to be anything special (might just be preference).  The bolognese was good but really didn't stand out.  For the 4th (main) course we split the filet and seafood risotto.  The risotto was the winner.  We both loved it and were shocked by the huge portions of lobster, scallops, crab, etc.  The sauce they use was outstanding. Would highly recommend it! The filet was good, but had a lot of butter, and was definitely not as good as the risotto.  Our only disappointment of the night was that we showed up 10 min early for our reservation and then weren't seated for over 30 min.  I know it's a busy, highly rated restaurant but we were a bit frustrated standing around that long.  Overall it is definitely deserving of all of the praise it receives and I would definitely come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I never expected the owner to reply my review, but Chris did. No business is perfect just like all of us. The most important thing is that the business is trying to solve the problems. For a business owner who cares about every customer's opinion, there's no batter business man he can be!"}
{"text":"Awesome artisan chef.   Unique and delicious.     They typically have a couple of dishes to choose from.  The chef clearly takes great care in menu selection as I've never been at a loss to find one I like.  Highly recommend this restaurant for brunch and recommend sitting on their beautiful patio!"}
{"text":"What more can I possibly say?  This place is amazing and I will never be able to visit Phoenix again without going to Cafe Monarch. Our server was a bit obsequious but he was good. The food was outstanding and the wine selections were appropriately varied and interesting as well.  I never thought I'd say this, but I could have licked my bowl clean of the cauliflower soup!!"}
{"text":"I too have been meaning to review for quite some time.    This place is unique in terms of Scottsdale.  The atmosphere is intimate and romantic.  Chris is a wonderful host and multiple times has accomodated for us being late for our reservation.  Our dishes have always been outstanding.  The best part- BYOB!  Having a 5 course dinner with two bottles of wine for 3 people for $150?  I'll take it!  There's no other place in town where you can get this kind of value.  Chris makes a point to get to know you a little more each time your there and last time we were there he even kept the place open late just chatting with us.  We will be back and I'm sure based on the other recent reviews that it will be harder and harder to get a reservation here!"}
{"text":"Great special occasion restaurant.   Leisurely meal and attentive service.   4 courses and while pricey, I thought a great value for the portions and quality of food.   It was our anniversary so we did receive a delicious free dessert.   Ambience is fantastic especially on the large patio.   Will accommodate dietary requests as well."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely  beautiful. The restaurant is one of the most beautiful most impeccable places I have ever been to. Every detail was perfection and even their bathroom was beautiful. We went there for our anniversary  and I really wanted to love it! The service was outstanding, friendly, attentive, special. My only problem was the food itself underwhelmed me a little. The starter courses wrere fabulous then came a salad that was very meh except for the candied bacon that was delicious the other ingredienta (some grana padano and a bitter dressing) not so much. My husband has a steak that was just okay nothing memorable and I had some scallops and they came over some lentil based and it was just underwhelming , they were well cooked but the other ingredients didn't  mesh al well. Their dessert was complimentary for our anniversary and  it was a phenomenal rum cake. I loved the place and service but the food did not do it for me sadly because it was definitely one of the prettiest places I have seen!"}
{"text":"So we had our wedding reception here and it was phenomenal. It was small, well as far as wedding receptions go, but everything went so smoothly, I couldn't have asked for anything else.  Christian and Philip were amazing, they were really accommodating, letting us check out the restaurant before making our reservation, and not even pushing us into making the reservation that night (even though we shot them an email the minute we got home saying we wanted in), having custom menus with the prices removed printed specially for us, and just being patient with all of our questions, and trust me, we had more than a few. They even let us drop off our decorations and cakes before they even opened for the day, which was a huge relief for me since I was afraid the cake would melt in the car as we went out to get our pictures taken before dinner.  The food itself was absolutely delicious - all our guests (and us too) were just blown away. In every dish, the flavors blended perfectly together and you really couldn't go wrong with any of the choices available for the 3rd and 4th courses. I cannot stress how many times, in between bites, my now husband kept saying he'd be taking me here for our anniversaries to come. And the presentation of each dish! Let's just say pretty much everyone at the table was taking pictures before digging in, though that got hard to do since we were getting a little too excited to try each dish as it came out.  The only thing I might have changed about the night was maybe our main waiter. Don't get me wrong, he did his job, but was just a little short with us. And this might have partially been my fault since I wanted things run a certain way and he didn't care to be told what to do, so I guess we just got off on the wrong foot. But at the table, in front of our guests, he did his job so I won't dwell too much on this.  All in all, amazing experience, and we're absolutely glad we chose Cafe Monarch for our reception!"}
{"text":"We found the original Cafe Monarch a couple years ago, and yes it was by far the best in the valley.  I was crushed to find it had closed.  Recently I saw it on Open Table and found they had reopened.  Alas, it is not the same place at all.  No more BYOB, which was fab, as we could enjoy a really great wine.  So now at $55 plus just for the food, it is quite expensive.  But then so are the (ugh) steak joints, soooo.  They really jammed the tables in the courtyard which is small.  The tables are tiny and you really feel crammed in.  God help a large man over 6 feet in the chairs.  The food was very interesting, a great mix of flavors but TOO SALTY.  Everything was too salty (except dessert).    NO BREAD.  For $55, can't I get some warm bread!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'd even pay $56!!!! Some of the sauces were very tastly (except salty) and I wanted to polish them off.  Was I to lick the plate to get my money's worth?   Please, give us some BREAD!!!  They also need WARM PLATES.  So hard?  Not really.  Our main course was warm but not hot.  I want my food HOT.     Be prepared to spend $100 each for dinner.  My hsb thought his meat was not the quality you would get in some places, but again compared to the steak places.....  That being said, we will try it again.  The food had a very interesting mix of flavors.  Everything was interesting, and would be outstanding if they lost some of the salt."}
{"text":"One of the best spots you fill find in town. We loved it. Little pricey but worth. Make sure you have a reservation."}
{"text":"This is a must see, must do restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale.  If there was one restaurant I'd recommend in the entire Phoenix metro for a great meal/experience this would be at the top of the list.  Cafe Monarch is great and sure has found a niche that it thrives well in.  Very out of the ordinary with the owner holding the duties of chef/hostess/busser/and server, but he sure does it well.   Having a very limited menu posted near the front door proudly tells what the chef wants to serve his patrons for that day. There's only two to three items listed with little description.  I was a little confused myself as I like to understand and take control of things, but I soon realized this was something to let the creator(the chef) to have his way with.     His creations come with enormous skill glorifying fresh ingredients into a dish that can appeal to anyone's palette.  I've enjoyed salads with salmon and chicken the times I have visited, but who knows what will be on the menu on my next visit.  Whatever it is, I will must certainly try it!   Two final matters, bring cash as the owner doesn't like give up the 3-5% the credit card companies like to charge for convenience of the American consumer.  Lastly, you will have to wait until September to enjoy this place as it is closed for the summer."}
{"text":"Took my lovely wife here. The food, service and atmosphere were outstanding!  We travel a lot and have never had food this good. Seriously would have liked to lick the plate good. When we travel we like to sample a variety of places... we have already made a second reservation for here on this trip. Anywhere else would fall short of the combination of flavors the kitchen has put together; for every course served.  We will make it a point to eat here whenever we are in the Phoenix area. We dressed up a little, but jeans would be ok too."}
{"text":"I can't and will never be able to rave enough about my experiences here. This has been my go to for Impressing my loved ones. With great service elegant menu. Thank you cafe monarch for never letting me down. The wine list is by far exceeding of expectations. Prices aren't bad for value either. The staff always trained and make your experience almost seem personal in how they treat you like family."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly nice. The patio was beautiful, romantic and just breathtaking.  They had the prix-fixed 4 course menu. You got the soup, caprese salad, choice of lamb or tuna tartar, and 1 of 4 main course choices (sea bass, sirloin, chicken or beet gnocchi).  There wasn't a course where I wasn't wanting to lick my plate clean. The roasted cauliflower soup with white truffle oil was smooth and creamy and AMAZING (and I don't usually like soup). Caprese salad was fresh and light. The tuna tartar was fresh and had a great flavor with a bit of spice kick. The Chilean sea bass was flaky, fresh and just incredible. Again, I was willing to lick my plate after each course. For dessert, we split the chocolate flourless cake and couldn't have been happier. It was light, and served with fresh fruit.  Very nice cocktail and wine list. I had a nice Savignon Blanc that went well for both glasses. Yes it was very expensive. But the service reflected the price and the quality was well deserving. Our water glasses never dropped below half full. They were kind enough to spray to help get rid of the flies that were around (huge help).  Such a great place. Expensive? Yes. But well worth it."}
{"text":"My hubby took me here for my birthday.  What a cute little gem!  We were seated by the fountain at the courtyard.  Had a lovely experience dining here.  Excellent wine pairing too. We felt like we were in Prague!  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the winter salad.  It was way too salty!  Apparently, they change the menu weekly, so we will probably return."}
{"text":"I made it a point to visit this restaurant during my trip to Phoenix.  Being from Manhattan, I am spoiled with exquisite restaurants to select from.  This was by far a true gem of a fine eatery.  The scallops were cooked to perfection with truly creative flavors.  The ambiance is chic, cozy and elegant."}
{"text":"I visited in December of 2016 when I was home for the holidays. I've been waiting to craft the upmost respectable review of this place ever since. Here I sit in February and I am still left speechless from my experience. The ambiance was simply breathtaking, relaxing, inviting, and romantic (even if I ate alone!). The staff was exceptional. Their knowledge of what they are placing in front of you and what is on the menu was remarkable. When it comes to the food, I'm still utterly speechless. The quality, the attention to detail, the taste... unbelievable. I've never had or savored food like this before. It was a beautiful beautiful experience and I will certainly return the next time I'm home again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"What a cute place with amaaaazing food and service!  I came her last week for my birthday, its more of a romantic setting that I would recommend to couples for a special night out. Theres a great patio in the back with large trees, shrubs, fountains, and candle lights all around.   All the staff seem to really care about the business and their customers. I felt that the food was worth the price and the overall setting and experience took it to the next level getting the 5 stars!"}
{"text":"An interesting, almost unique experience, dinner at Cafe Monarch is much like that in a small Spanish or Mediterranean cafe.  There are 17 seats, one chef, one waiter, and a fixed menu (you get your choice of three entrees however).  If you have special dietary requirements, tell the chef when you make your absolutely necessary reservations a month in advance.  The experience earns the four stars, but the food is not good enough to propel Cafe Monarch beyond that.  Not that it's bad -- but there are too many rough edges and not quites, such as the superfluous undercooked potatoes in the London Broil salad.  Service is slow -- three courses in two hours -- but you won't mind since you can watch the chef cooking from most tables and it is an exceptionally comfortable place to eat.  Definitely bring your own wine, expect to experience new tastes, ignore the minor eccentricities, and you will be glad you came."}
{"text":"Loved every moment.  Beautiful place,  exquisite service,  wonderful food. Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"prepare to spend a few hours here and really have a romantic experience. the food is divine. the service is laid back (in a good way). the chef runs the whole show and plays all hats. the menu is forever changing and when you make a reservation he will ask you questions so he can tailor your meal and experience to your needs. probably not a good first date place because if the date goes wrong, you will be stuck for a while. perfect spot for an anniversary or something. or even just to have a nice meal with people you know and care about."}
{"text":"Truly exceptional .......plate by plate, Chef Chris is sure to delight your palette with his fantastic flavors and fresh ingredients. Go there, just not on the days I want to go back...I don't need you getting in my way! :)"}
{"text":"It was absolutely awful what they did to us. First night out from our baby and we wanted to go somewhere special-- so, we chose here. We drove all the way from Peoria to pull into the parking lot, only for them to call us at 8:30 to tell us our reservation was for 8:30 was cancelled due to the rain. I looked up and there was no rain. It rained for like 20 minutes a half an hour ago... but I guess they rather have you drive there first before they refuse to take you in. It didn't rain the rest of the night either. Ended up going to a steakhouse down the street and sitting on their patio. Too bad for them because we were planning on getting a few gift certificates there too."}
{"text":"What a special treat to celebrate our birthdays at Cafe Monarch. The ambiance was romantic and the service was excellent.  The four course pre fixed meal started with cauliflower and clam chowder for each of us. Second course we both picked beef tartare. For the third course I had the duck and my husband had the Lamb Kreatopia. Both were so delicious. I had the seafood risotto for my main course and he had the Chilean Sea-bass. The main courses were so well seasoned. To top of it off they brought us each yummy desserts, banana fosters beignets and rum cake!!  Richard and the  team were so friendly and attentive.  He selected the perfect wine pairing with each course. They made the evening so enjoyable. We will definitely return the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent, Elegant, Essence of Beauty.  Would be a Perfect venue and restaurant for a private event."}
{"text":"The ambiance of Cafe Monarch is a 5 but we were really disappointed with the food.  I had the filet which by itself was flavorless.  The sauce was really good but it was necessary to mask the bland over cooked filet.  I ordered it medium rare and it was delivered medium well. My husband had the cannelloni and he said it was fair.  The cauliflower soup was good, salad fair and the dessert fantastic. We ordered the scallops and asked if that would be too much food. Our server said no and of course it was too much. Perhaps this was a bad night. The wait staff was attentive."}
{"text":"What a great and amazing experience...this place is a can't miss. If you're looking for a special romantic experience this is it! The patio is spectacular and brings an ambiance that can't be matched in a \"chain\" restaurant. The food was amazing! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I know i didn't have to, but i had to spoil myself before i head back home and boy....i am glad i did. From all the places that i have been to, this was the best tasting water i had all week. I finally got that funky taste out of my mouth from the crappy tasting water and was indulged by some fruit flavored water. What a great start to a wonderful and expensive dinner.  The price on the menu includes a full four course meal. Oh...boy, was i hungry. I was glad that the price included four courses. I was first spoiled with a butternut squash soup with a fried piece of goodness in the middle. (Sorry chief, i didn't take a picture of the menu and i have a bad memory on all the goodness that i ate.) The portions was small, but i was glad that it was because i was heading for a four course meal. with three-four spoon fulls, i was done and was waiting for more.   Next up was the salad. I never fell so much in love with the salad, coming from someone who loves meat. I mean even the lady at the next table was having loud foodgasims. It was a bit awkward, but the timing was perfect from what i was thinking in my head. It was arugula with some type of vinaigrette, a piece of juice watermelon with blue cheese, and a wonton crisp. Simple, but delicious.  Course number 3...the entree. The main course of the meal and the hero...the filet mignon. This hero was so tender and flavorful that my fork was jealous. As soon as i cut the meat, my fork had a piece, then it was gone. This pattern would repeat until it was all gone. The hero even brought his friends: a sweat potatoe puree, grilled asparagus, portabello mushroom slices, and crispy onions on top. It was a perfect harmony for the hero and his friends for my fork and my tummy.  Finally, the last course of the night was dessert. The one meal of the day that i wasn't too fond of. I did however like the ice cream. The vanilla bean ice cream was the perfect way to end the meal.   An overall great food experience."}
{"text":"WOW!!  This is a great, hidden gem in Scottsdale.  Based on the great Yelp reviews, this place will not be hidden for long!  My wife and I went here for lunch last week. We felt like we were eating at a friends house instead of at a restaurant.  Chris, the owner and chef, is a great cook, improvises magically and is very personable.  Instead of ordering from a menu, we were told by Chris what he had available in the kitchen...and he then offered options on how he could prepare to our tastes.  How great is that.  I started with a strong cup of coffee...Chris serves Cafe Du Monde...which is primo coffee which speaks to the coffee enthusiast.  My wife and I split a great French onions soup....which was great if you like onions!  I followed with a chicken sandwich with roasted peppers, goat cheese, spinach and cilantro. My wife had a chicken sandwich as well with bacon, fig, spinach and mint.  Both sandwiches were amazing and innovative.  We took notes on how to make to repeat when we got home!  However, the best part of Cafe Monarch is Chris...a great chef and business owner.  He cares about his guests, what they eat and sincerely wants you to have a great experience....and we did.   We'd go back again...and if I'm back in Scottsdale for business...I will!"}
{"text":"It's was our 30th wedding anniversary and terribly storming.  Our reservation was at 6:30. Didn't know how Uber would work out so we got there a little early. Here is wear the royal service started. They met us at the door of our Uber and welcomed us with a giant umbrella.  Walked us straight to our table, asked us if it was acceptable and seated us. Apologized for the weather and told us not to be disappointed.  They would make our night the most memorable.  Never ever have my wife and I had such a fabulous experience. Our waiter Sam explained the evening to us in a way to completely make us comfortable. Each course was explained and brought out at a pace to allow us to have a nice slow romantic conversation.  We decided to have Sam do a pairing for us. The wines were as great as the courses. Each mouthful of drink or food had such a variety of fantastic flavors it was incredible. I can honestly say after 30 years this is the most incredible, romantic, wonderful evening my wife and I have ever experienced. Thank you MONARCH.  I definitely recommend this place. REMEMBER you get what you pay for. This place really delivers."}
{"text":"We showed up because we read reviews on Yelp and were excited to try the food! No one mentioned it was reservation only and we had taken an uber so we were kind of stranded. The hostess was firm and didn't offer us any options for dining so we finally had to ask if we could just order a drink or something. She sat us in an area that overlooked the parking lot which sucked. We ordered these passion fruit drinks and they were so good!! I could have chugged the drink it was so smooth. They only offered a pre fixed menu and we weren't about to spend $80 pp to dine in a parking lot. Our bad for not double checking if they were reservation only."}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch is more than a restaurant - it's an experience. If I had to put an analogy to this one - I would say that most restaurants are like watching a concert on tv and this place is like being in the front row at a great show. I was immersed in Christopher's beautiful world and entertained the entire time.  As Camille H mentioned, this place may not be for everyone. There is no menu provided to pick things from. This is not a place for a quick snack, although, I bet if you asked, Christopher would provide it. If you are a picky eater or have food allergies, call ahead of time. But if you go in with the mindset that you are going to be surprised with a meal full of the freshest ingredients, wonderful combinations of flavors and fantastic stories to every dish, you will not be disappointed.  I am not sure I would bring my five year old to this place. She would enjoy it, but I think my husband and I will get most out of our dining experience with a babysitter. Since Christopher is a one man show - chef, server, host, story teller, etc. etc, each course takes awhile, and my child's attention span most likely would not last through the entire meal.  For a description of the amazing food we ate, please see Camile H's review. She described everything perfectly.  This is my new favorite place in the valley. I can't wait to go back! Highly highly highly recommend this experience!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible restaurant. Chef 4 course menu is incredible. Service is incredible. The ambiance, the decor, everything is awesome."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful surprise for my anniversary last year. While the prices are high, the experience is worth it. I had scallops, which were incredible, but the real star of the show was the cauliflower soup. I've tried time and time again to recreate even a semblance of it in my own kitchen, but I'm convinced it cannot be done. This is a great place to celebrate a special occasion, get a little dressed up and go for a good old-fashioned Scottsdale people watching session."}
{"text":"We did the wine pairing with the four courses.  It's a tour through the world via wine. Our server was Sam, he was professional and knowledgeable. The service was well choreographed. My filet was perfectly prepared and my wife loved her salmon. The desert was on point. I would put their rum cake against the butter cake at City Hall. Great date place. Love it."}
{"text":"I think 5 stars is not enough to rate this restaurant, I have been in 5 stars restaurants around the worl, but nothing like this, unbelievable atmosphere,  the food is out of this world, and the service is great, I felt we were in a different planet.....diffently we will comeback....thank you for all this. ....."}
{"text":"Most exquisite cuisine, best restaurant in town! The service is impeccable, attention to details and super friendly staff! Each course better than the previous! Classic example the excellence is not expensive it is actually priceless!!! I am sorry it took me that long to find this place!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service, ambiance and outdoor dining. Moderate portions, expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"The entire experience and all of the food was top notch! This place is the full package with some of the most professional, entertaining and organized staff I have ever encountered. The food was beautifully prepared and presented. I left the night pleasently full and satisfied. Even a normal night feels like a special occasion at Cafe Monarch."}
{"text":"Gracious gastronomic greatness  Had Cafe Monarch on our foodie bucket list since the flattering piece about it in Phoenix Magazine.  Originally wanted to partake last summer, before finding out that it is closed during hell season in the Valley.  My wife and I visited for Valentine's Day, instead.  The converted house is beautifully done.  Service staff isn't what you'll find at a five-star/diamond place in terms of polish, but they are none the less attentive and thorough.  Some tips: Do not forget that CM is cash only; make a reservation; is price ($45) per person; and is BYOD.  There were a number of couples disappointed to step up and find out the place is already booked until March.  Another was surprised there is no ATM.  Minor things if you remember and prepare.  Food was simply perfect.  The soup was delicate and you could play with the flavors in your mouth rather than be overwhelmed by salt or sugar or vinegar or even the stock.  The steak was immaculate in flavor and texture (he even cut against the grain).  And the dessert was an elating triple chocolate confection that mixed soft, crunchy, and smooth ganache flavors in a way I had not previously experienced.    Serving sizes are what they should be.  Nothing like the over-sized, moderate-quality options at even chain nicer chains.  The setup is each table belongs to you for the whole night and there's no rush to flip tables for volume.  Last, the chef gives the impression of a kinder Gordon Ramsey-- just as serious and meticulous, is direct with his wait crew about attentiveness, but is also kind with his efforts.  It was nice that he called ahead to incorporate our food preferences.  Was more impressive that he remembered my wife's name when we checked out.   Cafe Monarch helped make our Valentine's a superb night.  The dishes are wonderfully memorable.  We'll be back for brunch, dinners, and new food experiences."}
{"text":"Wow! I was in town on a week long business trip and the one thing I look forward to most when I travel are the meals. Cafe Monarch was a highlight of my trip. As soon as I walked through the door I felt cozy and right at home. Chef Chris asked me what I preferred out of a few selections and I went with the lamb chops and spinach.  Usually I'm pretty picky about lamb and always inquire about prep but I left myself in his hands.  Chef Chris served me a perfectly cooked thyme rubbed lamb with a wonderful citrus sauce.  Spinach was prepared with garlic and a hint of mint which complemented the lamb perfectly.  Simple, fresh, delicious...  Just remember to bring cash"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review about this place for quite sometime. We had our rehearsal dinner here back in April of 2009. The Chef was so amazing and so accommodating.   We were able to rent out the entire place for a private event, which isn't large to begin with but its very romantic and intimate. He created a wonderful menu for our guests upon our request which was different from any regular restaurant fair, and different from what we were serving at our reception. That was important to my husband and I as we had a lot of people from out of town attending and wanted to give them a great experience.  There were candles everywhere and beautiful flowers, it was just a great experience. I will admit, I was skeptical but it turned out to be a beautiful night.   The only reason I am giving this 4 stars, is if I remember correctly, it is cash only. If you are like me, you don't carry cash, like ever. And there is no set menu. Chef Chris cooks with local ingredients and the menu changes everyday.  But the food was great and the portion sizes were more than what I expected.   I believe they close for the summer, since most of the seating is outside so make reservations once they re-open! Also, come with an open mind and open palette. It's also BYOB so come prepared and you will have a great evening. Its nice to find a small, intimate place in such a busy, fast-paced metro area. It will feel like you are somewhere else!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST dinning experiences ever!  Just wish they had one in Southern California!     The ambiance is as romantic as it gets!  If you're thinking of proposing, this is the place to do it! Excellent food and Service as well..Worth the price.  Live a little or in this case,  a lot!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is small, personal, and just full of good vibes. Chris is a one man show and yes, it is that crazy as it sounds. How he does it all, I am not sure. But, I can witness that he doesn't have 8 arms either. He looks so chill that you assume he doesn't know the definition of stress. Jealous? Yea, I was. Back to dinner. It is a byob = awesome. Pre fixed dinner of $45/person. You need reservations for dinner. When you call he asks you your preferences. Chicken, meat, seafood any allergies etc. You come in and he first serves the appetizer. Mine was an assortment of vegetables (mushrooms, eggplant, pesto, tomatoes) and lots of goodness. The entree fish cakes with this sweet sauce. Dessert was AMAZING. Fruits like plums and berries over this cream and flaky crust. It was aromatic and sweet, but just the right amount. Chris is so sweet and makes you feel comfortable. The bathroom was cool looking too :)"}
{"text":"Cafe Monarch is everything the five star reviews make it out to be and more. It's a must try for a unique brunch/lunch/dinner/whatever experience in the valley! I'm reluctant to review this place since I don't want to wade through patrons on my way to another lovely Sunday brunch, but my taste buds will not be deterred. (Plus I have until September before they re-open, so there's plenty of buffer room.)  It's an impromptu fly-by-the-seat-of-whatever-the-chef-feels-like-whipping-up type place. The kind of place where you show up to breakfast and are asked one question: Sweet or savory?   So whatever you do, leave those picky eater at home! When it comes to dinner, you don't want a wonderbread palate (\"Um, I don't eat anything green...\") influencing the meal. Chef Christopher is a dynamo in the kitchen, and you need to leave that one man show plenty of room to create his masterpieces. No exaggeration, his dishes are crazy delicious masterpieces. It's like having your own personal top chef customizing something just for you.  The fact that this place is BYOB makes my heart smile. I love sharing a couple bottles of good wine or champagne among friends over dinner, and the fact that I don't have to pay a restaurant mark-up is ideal. He's also cool with you brining in some orange or cranberry juice for  DIY mimosas in the morning. There's a $10 corking fee, but considering the fact that a glass of wine is often more expensive than that, it's a screaming deal.   Be forewarned that this is a dining experience rather than a quicky meal. A much more European approach to lingering and enjoying the food, drink and atmosphere. It will take you a couple hours to get through everything from initial seat and greet with the chef (who doubles as the waiter/busser/todos!) to your last scrumptious bite. Totally worth every minute of waiting. Also, you might not want to come here starvin marvin. And definitely don't invite anyone you can't stomach hanging out with for a couple hours.   Let's wrap it up: -Don't bring picky eaters. -Don't come so hungry that you'd eat the ass end carpaccio out of fresh roadkill. -Don't bring socially awkward schmoes that will suck all the fun out of the room because you've got to be around that for hours, man. Hours. -Do BYOB, and don't be afraid to bring a mixer for mimosa fun. -Do bring cash only, and tip very, very well. (He deserves it!)  I now set you forth upon the world with the knowledge necessary to enjoy all that Cafe Monarch has to offer. Use it wisely."}
{"text":"One of the best meals we've ever had.  Each dish better than the one before, and the wine pairings were fantastic.  We secured patio seating, and it was a delightful evening.  Service and food were excellent!  We've recommended this place to total strangers and hope they were paying attention!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Celebrated my first anniversary here, and it was absolutely worth it.  To start with the host and server both wished us a happy anniversary as soon as we walked in.  Usually, you don't hear a word about it to the end, so it took us both by surprise.  Our server was incredibly knowledgeable concerning wines, they didn't have a Malbec at the time but he served up two more delicious wines that made me completely forget about a Malbec (forever).  All the courses tasted amazing!  For the main course I had the filet mignon which was dynamite, talk about just perfectly cooked and exactly how I ordered.   My wife ordered the sea bass; during dinner I had just told her that I hated sea bass.  I tried hers for kicks, and again took me by surprise.  That's probably the best fish that I have ever tasted, and I am not a fan.  The servers added a special touch for the occasion, and overall this restaurant/experience was well worth it.  I will also say...it was 115 degree day (End of July), we had dinner around 7pm. The outdoor patio with the misters was still manageable, I barely noticed the surrounding heat.  I would say sit outside if you have the opportunity.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Location - In a colorful area with four other businesses.  Reservations - Required for dinner on Friday/Saturday, and recommended other times when open.  It wasn't busy at 11 am on Saturday for brunch, but you should still call.  When I called to make reservations, the owner, Christopher was very friendly and even remembered me when I arrived.  Hours of Operation - 11-3 daily and for dinner on Friday and Saturday only.  Website - N/A Payment - Cash recommended but owner will take debit/credit card. Service - Slow but very friendly.  Owner is the cook/server/manager/host.  Everything is at a leisurely pace.  Therefore, if you are expecting a quick place to dine, don't come here.  We were the first customers luckily and our meal still took about 2 hours.  When we left, one server appeared to help out Christopher. Decor/Ambiance - Very quaint decor.  Owner decorated place himself.  French country, peaceful, waterfall running in the back.  A fresh lemon and wax paper line each checkered blue table.  Relatively small place, never a line for \"seating\" but be expected to wait for food.  Price - Pricey but well worth it.  It's as close as I'll ever be to having my own personal chef.  Brunch/lunch was $20, plus we were charged a corkage fee of $10.  I believe dinner is $45/person for a three course meal that is planned that day. Food - As stated, don't eat here if you are picky.  BYOB is encouraged so we brought a bottle of champagne from the Circle K nearby. Christopher provided us with a bottle chiller and flutes.  For our meal, Christopher asked if we were interested in brunch or lunch.  There are some items on a chalkboard menu by the kitchen, but for the most part, there is no written menu.  Christopher will ask what we feel like eating and if we have any preferences or dislikes.  Then the conversations goes something like \"...okay, you would like some brunch.  How about, some French toast with fresh fruit and bacon? I can also make some fresh French roast coffee or hibiscus iced tea?\"  All the ingredients are seasonal and entrees made when ordered.  1. French toast with orange sauce, walnut cinnamon confit, fresh fruit medley and oven cooked bacon - French toast was light, crispy outside and soft inside.   Fruit was cut fresh (pineapple, banana, strawberries, grapes, oranges and a caramelized pear) and seasonally sweet.  Bacon was cooked to perfection. 2. French Roasted Coffee - Not overly strong, but great delicate taste."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting the grandparents. They definitely treat you like royalty here! As a vegetarian, they were very accomodating. The small plates were delicious, and they comped my drinks since the misting water was dripping on my head (good thing it didn't stain my expensive dress!). My veggie entree was just okay with a somewhat bland with simply chopped veggies with risotto, and my husband got SICK after eating his sea bass entree. Reminder: NEVER ORDER FISH IN THE DESERT.   Overall, though, it was quite a lovely experience, and the staff were exquisitely attentive!"}
{"text":"Vegan/vegetarian friendly! Exquisite food. It's the cutest little place with candles all over and warm fire places. Great service!!! Came here with my whole family."}
{"text":"Cash only is accepted. The food is excellent. I went for a sunday brunch. My options were savory or sweet. $20 a person without tip. It was excellent. I got french toast but the menu changes all the time. Very pretty patio and great service. Chef Christopher is amazing."}
{"text":"WOW!  Ate here last Sunday with my wife and 2 friends. This is a unique experience, almost like sitting in your favorite chef's house and sitting by the kitchen while he prepares you a personal feast.   We all loved it - everything. I had a Chicken with some kind of amazing pepper reduction that reminded me of a Mole type of sauce, and the mashed potatoes on the side were just garlicky enough and a wonderful consistency - I ate every bite and I don't usually like potatoes!  Chis... the chef and owner... and server... and greeter... and entertainer and maitre d'...and busser... was working his butt off but in the end the whole experience was just fantastic and this guy is creating some genuine magic here at Monarch.  One little issue was I noticed a bit of smoke in the air from all the cooking just like 10 ft away - I think they could probably get a little heavier duty exhaust fan in the kitchen... But in a way it just reminded me of how close this experience comes to almost being at a chef's private home while he whips up a few favorites for his friends.   BYOB? Yup, and only $10 a bottle for corkage!  What a deal, and also respectful as most cities in the United States (except Phoenix) offer this as the rule rather than the exception. Smart!    The dessert was also fantastic - an entire plate for each guests filled with chocolate ganache, fresh whipped cream, a poached pear to die for...and delicate puff pastry.  Mmmm... We will be back, if we will be lucky enough to get a reservation in this soon to be \"impossible to get into\" little gem."}
{"text":"Excellent with one big caveat which I'll save till the end.  First, why five stars?  The foremost reason is the place (ie atmosphere).  One of the things I miss about San Francisco (just moved to Phoenix in Summer of 2010) are the small eateries with lots of personality.  They are difficult to find in this area.  Well, Cafe Monark fits that description perfectly.  Very small tucked away nicely in a quiet corner in the Oldtown.    The owner is the greeter, chef, waiter and cashier.  The place only has about 20 seats.  The food is excellent and from what I can tell the set menu changes regularly.  Lastly, it's BYOB with a $10 corkage.  So, for the caveat, it can be slow.  That what makes it unique (run completely by the owner) can make it slow.  However, come with a nice bottle or two and enjoy the place.  The food is worth the wait and the experience is certainly unique."}
{"text":"In a world full of overpriced, ultra hip, high-attitude and low-quality Scottsdale restaurants, it was refreshing to find this amazing gem, Cafe Monarch.  A place where time slows down, and where great service is not an endangered species.  This place is truly amazing, from the ambiance of dinning room, to the romantic patio heated by the gentle glow of central fireplace.    Our waiter, Chris, restored my faith in good service.  Over the years, I have given up on even expecting good service from a waiter at a restaurant.  The plethora of chain restaurants staffed by mechanical robots who repeat pre-prepared lines that someone in corporate marketing written down for them has lowered my expectation for service everywhere.  Chris, however, was a breath of fresh air.  A waiter who actually \"CARED\" about our dining experience, and made sensible recommendations on food and wine to ensure that we got the most out of evening.  Furthermore, he went out of his way to accommodate any request we had even though the place was packed on a Saturday night.  Most important, he had passion for what he was doing, and it showed.    The menu was fantastic, even though it is a set menu that includes four courses, it has enough flexibility and choice to accommodate almost any taste.   The wine list was extensive and extremely well-balanced in terms of selection and price.    Well Done Cafe Monarch!  You have brought all the right elements together to create a new standard in Scottsdale.    Dining Experience Perfection!"}
{"text":"Dinner for two after a spring training game.  We booked our reservation months in advance. (They warn you that outdoor patio seating is on best-efforts basis when you book). We arrived, plenty of parking, and were greeted by Matre' D.  She told us we would be seated in 20 minutes.   Things went downhill from there until we were finally seated to a delicious dinner.   We were asked to 'wait' at a table, they would serve cocktails and and app.  We were ignored for 15 minutes (I went back to complain) and then we were finally served a drink and the yummy appetizer showed up.  The cocky waiter asked how our drinks were (I didn't like my cocktail).  He never asked me - he just smiled at my wife who enjoyed hers and just left. After another twenty minutes he never returned.  I went back up to ask to be served another cocktail - since our waiter was too busy or indifferent to serve us.  I wanted to leave at that point.    Almost all of the 'waiting to be seated' tables were assigned tables while we were waiting for our drink (45 minutes later).    My wife left for for the bathroom and came back telling me about the 'line' for the ladies room.  She was stunned that a restaurant could get a way with so few bathrooms (she is a space planner).  Finally we were shown our table (so they get 1 STAR for the first 45 minutes).  After that things got better.  We sat on the patio (a delightful venue), and enjoyed a very nice dinner (check out their menu).  Our waiter was quite knowledgeable  and helpful.   The food was 4 star quality. And dinner service was great.  Monarch needs to focus on expectation setting and weak staff.   This is a place with a great venue (worth waiting for) with terrific food but:   - maitre' D cant set expectations   - one waiter in front area needs to be let go   - bathroom situation needs investigation"}
{"text":"My husband and I have made reservations and come here two years in a row for our anniversary. I'm so glad they've expanded to a larger venue. It is lovely inside and outside, but we chose to sit inside due to the heat because he was in a suit. The staff were super accommodating towards our vegan/vegetarian diet and both the menu and service did not disappoint. I think it is safe to say we will continue this tradition! :)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. I love byob! The girls at the table ordered the filet minion and it was decent, but the boys ordered chicken and it was raw. The chef sincerely apologiZed and gave them catfish instead. They loved it! I loved the place the chef was nice and we will return again!"}
{"text":"5 stars for outdoor dining, I think this place has the luxury to charge a heavy price tag just on ambiance alone. 4 stars for the food, the course menu is interesting, portions are small, and is rotated seasonally. Overall great experience, however I don't believe the price tag is appropriate for the food. It made me feel better spending $300 for a dinner for two, due to the scenery being very intimate and beautiful."}
{"text":"Anniversary Dinner - What a lovely spot!   Our anniversary fell on Sunday night and Cafe Monarch was very busy! Our waiter made the experience very memorable. He started by bringing us sparkling wine to celebrate our special event.   We started with both soup selections - Cauliflower and Lobster Bisque - they were not the highlight of the meal as both were just fine. The winter salad was quite nice, nothing unique but the dressing and all the elements were very nice. The Lollipop Lamb was a double cut and was prepared perfectly and the Tempura King Prawn was too spicy and seemed out-of-place with the rest of the meal. We enjoyed the Filet MIgnon and Sea Bass for our entrees - both were outstanding.   We had no intention of getting dessert but, again, our waiter surprised us with the most amazing Rum Cake to share. This was a perfect end to an outstanding dinner!"}
{"text":"Redemption!!!  Ok so this place ruined our anniversary back in 2013 when they lost our confirmed reservation. Now its under new management and everything went smoothly.  Food was awesome!! The Main Course was by far the best dishes of the meal but the others were quite good as well. We would definitely come back if there was a GRoupon or something like that. If it wasn't on a deal we agreed we probably wouldn't.  We liked it a tad better than Binkleys but not as much as Kai and its similarly priced. $250 for a couple with a couple of drinks.  Nice atmosphere for sure. Id probably wait until Fall and sit on the patio though. The inside spot we got was right by the door and the door opens and closes about 10x a minute so it was definitely HOT inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"This was such a charming restaurant, I sat on the patio with my husband for his birthday and it was just breathtaking. I just absolutely loved the ambience outside, it was a little secret garden. They played romantic music and had candles and lights everywhere.   The food was great, the first three entrees were a little small, but the main entree made up for it at the end. I was a little let down they didn't serve bread with the meal, but I left content. I had the Chilean Sea Bass and it was cooked to perfection. I don't think I have ever had Sea Bass cooked that well before, it had a crispy crust and just melted in my mouth.   I definitely plan on coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I came in for the first time last Friday with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and everything from the atmosphere to the food and service were amazing. We added the wine pairing option and were not disappointed. Our server was knowledgeable, professional and friendly. The courtyard is amazing and very romantic. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Cafe Monarch! My boyfriend and I had dinner on Saturday night and the food was amazing as always. The service here is always equally amazing, and it's hard to find good service in old town. Ask for Marlen, he does a great job, very knowledgeable! My boyfriend is a foodie and could write for days about flavor profiles and textures, etc but all you need to know is that the food tastes great. I really appreciate that the menu changes every week because every week there is something new to be excited about trying. I also highly recommend trying every dish just as the chef has prepared it (as long as it doesn't interfere with allergies of course). I can be a picky eater at times but everything on the plate is there for a reason and I have surprised myself at how much I enjoy certain ingredients when they are used the right way. This place is perfect for romantic/special occasions, the outside courtyard is very beautiful decorated and cozy. One of my favorite AZ restaurants!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I've gone three years living in Arizona and JUST KNOW getting to experience Cafe Monarch but last night was absolutely WONDERFUL! We had a 7:30 reservation but didn't get seated till about 8:15 but it truly was ok because they sat us at the beautiful, lively bar. The restaurant itself is gorgeous! Everything my date and I ordered was delicious. We started with the foie gras, I enjoyed the cauliflower soup, beef tartare, duck breast, seafood risotto and the rum cake all of which were FANTASTIC!!! The service was fabulous, our server was friendly, knowledgeable of the menu and extremely attentive without being annoying. We sat outside on the perfectly heated patio. I would definitely recommend for any and all occasions! I can't wait to go back next weekend!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now, they finally opened back up and we went Saturday night. It was well worth the wait! Everything about the experience was amazing.One of the most beautiful restaurants I have ever seen. I love all the touches with candles and lanterns. So romantic and we seriously loved the place. First taste was a crostini with jalapeno jam, brie cheese and green. Delicious! I wish I had more. First course was a beet salad with toasted hazelnuts. Also very good and I don't even like beets. Second course was a choice between filet and salmon. My boyfriend got the filet and I got the salmon. Both were incredible! And dessert was a pastry with fruit and ice cream. Pretty good, I enjoyed it and I usually like chocolate more. Overall such a great dining experience Got to meet the owner and the chef after dinner. All super polite and engaging. We will be back!!! Perfect location for a rehearsal dinner :)"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the ambiance and food at Cafe Monarch - nearly a perfect evening! It's tucked away on 1st Avenue in Scottsdale, and on this cool and rainy evening, we felt very comfortable. It's prix fixe, $45, plus drinks. We enjoyed the salad and then had the two choices for entree - scallops and pork osso buco. Each dish was prepared perfectly, and the desert was excellent, too. The waiter was good - and the only quibble is that that fellow picking up plates as we finished stopped 3 times to ask if we were done, when we were clearly not. Once is fine, 3 times is not good training. The bill came just as I took my last sip of coffee - also a bit rushed. Everything else was well paced and done well, and the rest of the evening was wonderful. Enjoy! Recommended for a special evening."}
{"text":"When visiting a new city for one night you hope to pick the perfect spot to experience food, ambiance and great service. Cafe monarch fulfilled all of those expectations. I loved everything about this place. It's the perfect date night spot or place to celebrate an occasion.  The ambiance is dark and romantic but not overly done. The menu is a price fix menu so there are very few decisions to make. My husband and I started with the cauliflower soup that was topped with truffle oil. Of course it was tasty and rich. The next course was tempura battered prawn. The prawn was a good size and the flavors accompanying it really made the dish stand out. The third course was a Caesar salad which it was anything but. There were so many flavors that I never felt like I was eating a Caesar salad. This also happened to be my husband's favorite dish and he doesn't even like Cesar salads. The last course I had the Sea bass and he had the filet. We both enjoyed our meals and above all didn't leave feeling gross and overly stuffed. The portions were perfect. We topped the meal off with a flourless cake which was melt in your mouth delicious.   Our service was very good. We sat inside since we liked the interior of the place so much. Our waiter was very helpful with choosing a wine and explaining how the menu worked. He described the dishes that we could choose from in good detail to help us make our selections. They also give you time between dishes and never rush you. We enjoyed our bottle of wine and our dinner very much."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for Valentines Day (very cliché but its actually his birthday too!).  So naturally, the prices were jacked up.  Either way, the meal was absolutely amazing.  Service was on point and atmosphere... well... that's just part of the entire package.  I love the fixed menu and being surprised.  Cocktails were superb as well.  Overall, if you want to splurge, and are looking for a unique, romantic dining experience... this is THE place!"}
{"text":"Went to my favorite spa in paradise valley to celebrate a 10 year anniversary with my partner and wanted to go off-premises for a different experience.  Always let Yelp reviews guide me and my fellow yelpers did NOT let me down.  This was the  most elegant, romantic, culinary experience we could have found.  The weather was unbelievable so it made the evening even more amazing.  We sat out on their patio and had the most memorable experience we've had in a long while.  The customer service exceeds that of any fine restaurant I've ever been to in LA, Paris, New York, and other cities known for their foodie-like experiences.  We were fortunate to have Sam that evening and his mentee, Michael.  They were a large part of what made this evening so memorable.  They went above and beyond to make sure that our needs were met and that everything was perfect.  I, unfortunately, cannot eat spicy foods or my stomach rebels instantly but they worked with the chef to make sure that every dish was tailor made and was as flavorful (or more) than the spicy dish that was part of the menu.  The food, all of it, was outstanding and each creation was a flavorful explosion.  The brussel sprout appetizer, the watermelon salad, the soft-shell crab (a real treat), the sea bass (melted in my mouth), and the wine selection were outstanding.  They also treated us to their rum cake for dessert.  I kept looking around to see if I could lick each and every plate.  And i'm not really a plate-licker.  They even gave us a little anniversary gift.  This place is magical.  I hope that they continue to make magic.  Thank you Cafe Monarch!"}
{"text":"Literally speechless. I absolutely love this place. The ambiance, the decor, the customer service and the FOOD. Geez. Two thumbs up.  Very shabby chic, lanterns candles everywhere. If you're not sitting in a patio, you're definitely missing out.. each table had a white cloth, candle lit and a rose in a vase.  My boyfriend and I had a four-course meal here of course and it was just wonderful. I love how the menu said \" vegetarian option available \" score!!!!!! $$$$$  Our first course was the roasted cauliflower. Oh wowwww. So creamy and so tasteful.  Second course was the spring salad. Best salad I had ever had actually.  Third course was the gnocchi for me and the lollipop lamb chop for the bf. He said it was heavenly. The gnocchi was a bit chewy, but the sauce was delicious.  Fourth course was the polenta lasagna and the rosary filet mignon. I absolutely loved my lasagna. I would have finsihed it but I was so full from all the food I had prior to my entrée. The mushrooms was delightful. Ummm I can tell he loved his filet mignon......... cause his face expression said it all. Hahaha.  I'LL BE BACK.  Yesss. Take me backkkkkkk"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The service was great and the food was excellent. Very charming and romantic atmosphere too. It's a set menu other than your main course, but we were very happy with all of the courses, and the additional scallop appetizer was amazing. We had a perfect evening!"}
{"text":"This place rules.  My wife and i went for a Saturday lunch and it was awesome.  Chirstopher was still setting up when we got there, we were first in the restaurant, so we just sat and pulled a book off the wall and hung out.  So, not much to say that hasn't been said.  Not really a menu, there are a few items that he has prepared for the meal but anything can be customized to your liking.  I had a BLT on grilled bread with dates and barley salad that was probably the best i've ever eaten.  My wife had a roasted pear salad with red wine glaze and a huge hunk of quality blue cheese, and she added a chicken breast and he didn't bat an eye.  Every bite was so full of flavor.  The place itself is pretty small, and the chef prepares your food like 5 feet away, every table inside is essentially a chefs table.  You can talk with him and observe while he cooks, as long as its not too busy.  The atmosphere is awesome, books on the walls to check out, all kinds of pictures, and for me the open kitchen is the entertainment.  This place is cash only and BYOB, so be prepared.  We only went for lunch but looks like a perfect place to take a couple of bottles of wine and hang out for dinner.     This place was awesome, can't wait to go back.  Bring an open mind and a good dose of patience and i don't see how you couldn't love it."}
{"text":"Gentlemen, if you want to impress your lady, this is the place to go. Beautiful romantic atmosphere, amazing food, fantastic service. They made our anniversary dinner extra special and didn't pooh pooh accommodations for this expectant mother (which I find many higher end chefs do).  This place is a bit dressier then the average restaurant (men should wear collared shirt) but not stuffy (wear said collared shirts with a nice tailored Jean). Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Celebrated our 26th wedding anniversary and wanted to try something new to us.  They exceeded all expectations and more!!  Be prepared, it is a little pricey, but well worth it.  The waiters were incredible and the ambiance is amazing.  Treat your self to a nice evening and go check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful girls night out here with my 3 best friends.  The basics:  $45 per person, cash only for a 3 course meal.  $10 per bottle corking fee.  Food was delicious and portions were HUGE!  The restaurant itself was situated in a small house.  It was beautifully decorated with candles and had a beautiful courtyard with a warm fire to sit by between courses.  Our server was very intuitive and could tell that a near by table (obviously celebrating a birthday) was being a bit loud so offered a nice table in the courtyard under a heat lamp for us to enjoy our dessert in peace.   We were also able to meet Chef Chris who we could clearly tell was passionate about his restaurant and the wonderful menu he creates daily.  The amazing thing is that he makes all these creations with only hot plates and panini presses (no gas line to the building)!  Would certainly love to visit again next time we are in town.  Only thing I would suggest is some heavy drapes in the dining room to help dampen conversations.  Bottom line: great food, great staff, beautiful restaurant and an excellent value!"}
{"text":"A big group came on my birthday and while I was thinking there was no way it could be as good without Christopher, I was wrong.  I will without a doubt be back for more."}
{"text":"We dined here last night and enjoyed a truly memorable, one of a kind dinner. The staff catered to our every request and the food was absolutely incredible. Perfectly portioned and every bite was it's own slice of heaven. The restaurant is also breathtakingly beautiful. We can't wait to return on our next trip to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I remember when this place was quaint, hidden away and the chef would talk to you.... it was one of my favorites.  ...now they've expanded, and thr chef is nowhere to be found... too bad..."}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience. Every course was better than the next. Would highly recommend for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Want to win with the ladies on date night?  Shell out a few extra bucks, put on a pressed shirt, and set reservations for a patio table at Cafe Monarch. It's got this super romantic and charming ambiance, amazing pre-fixe dinners with excellent wine pairings, and we had impeccable service with knowledgeable waitstaff and an in-house sommelier when we went. Expect at least an hour and a half to 2 hours dining experience. The portions are small for their high end price, but it's one of those places where your date will surely be impressed. If you want large portions, try Chili's or Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"I came back here again for my birthday dinner. This is the first time I've been back since they have redone the back patio renovations and I'm glad we did. The environment oozes romance. The food was exquisite and service impeccable. I wish they still had the BYOB option (corking fee applies) because I had tasteful bottles of wine I would have loved to pair my meal with.  My date loved it too. I will definitely be back with my plus one."}
{"text":"I would give Cafe Monarch 10 stars!!!  Food and service are AMAZING!!!  The sizes of the portions were small, but I think we all forget what fine dining is about...Not the quantity but the quality.  The quality of the food was simply out of this world.  I have been to a few other places like Tarbells, and this place puts them to SHAME!!  The service is absolutely top notch.  Not sure why anyone would rate this place less than 5 stars, unless they can't afford or appreciate great food and service.  I will absolutely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Tremendous experience overall. It was my for wife's birthday (and she is 32 weeks pregnant), so it was one of our last date nights before kids. Scott and the other waiters were incredibly attentive all night. Each course was outstanding and flavorful. The ambiance was playful yet romantic. We will be eager to plan our next special occasion dinner here once our little one joins us in a few months."}
{"text":"Husband and I went to Cafe Monarch for his birthday last night after seeing a review that they were vegan friendly.  I was a little hesitant having been told the same by other fine dining restaurants only to be served a salad I could make myself.  That couldn't have been farther from the case here.  Each course was brilliant in both taste and presentation.  Our server, Sam, had a fantastic knowledge of the wine list and was able to suggest a bottle that definitely suited our tastes.   The one and only negative I can report is that it was loud and crowded but that was understandable as their patio was closed due to a heavy rainstorm and everyone was seated inside.  We will absolutely be back and I encourage other vegan foodies to check this place out."}
{"text":"Pros - Unique dining concept, Owner/Chef/Waiter/Busboy Christopher is very fun and engaging, great small restaurant ambiance (3-4 small tables indoors, large outdoor dining), BYOB, and creative food experience.  Cons - Your meal is influenced by other people's food preferences.  I took a large group of out of town visitors to Cafe Monarch because I read such great reviews on Yelp.  Reservations are key to dining here.  When you make your reservation, you need to provide Christopher with your food preferences and he whips up a meal for your group based on what you tell him you can't eat.  It's definitely not a place for picky eaters.  The meal he created was good and made me want to come back to see what he'd make the next time.  Be forewarned, this was a 2-3 hour dining experience so don't expect to dine and dash."}
{"text":"+ makes people instantaneously love little cafes.  + as good as it gets! - in arizona."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: After our last trip, which went awry (see the review), I got a phone call from the manager (owner?) apologizing for what went wrong, explaining that their chef had an emergency of sorts and needed to leave and someone else took over who did not do his job correctly. She said that she knew that this dinner was a total mess and that she wanted us to come back another night to try it again. I, of course, told her that was not necessary, but I appreciated the offer, but she insisted several times. That is how I found myself back there tonight.   Tonight's dinner was night and day different than the dinner we had two weeks ago. I know this may be slightly skewed since we had been asked back after having a not as good experience, but because of the nature of this restaurant (everyone gets the same food) I still think this experience was valid.   The patio continues to be beautiful, and tonight was a great night for the patio because it was cool, not cold, and the heaters were not necessary. The menu was a very good one, though not particularly suited to the husband and I (as we aren't generally fans of seafood and this menu was seafood heavy). Despite this, we enjoyed every bite of the meal.   We started with a lobster bisque. I was prepared not to like this, as I don't love lobster, but this was sooo good. Creamy, velvety, and not too fishy. It was served with a piece of toast that soaked up the broth...really good. Secondly, we had the same salad as the last time we were there....but it wasn't the same. It had the same components, but it was made correctly this time... last time it was just a piece of brie, with plain undressed arugula, plain nuts and a big piece of poached pear.... this time the salad was dressed perfectly, it had a thin slice of poached pear and a slice of poached apple and the brie was grilled (I think....)... it was so much better. For main dishes we had a filet topped with crab and a bearnaise sauce served with cheesy delicious potatoes, beets which were....beets, and nicely cooked asparagus and sea bass topped with cucumber and avocado served over red quinoa cooked with bacon, roasted carrots, and a delicious sauce (this was super flaky and delicious....the husband liked it better than the steak which is very unusual). Dessert was also tasty, it wasn't what it said it would be on the menu (was supposed to be chocolate espresso, but was a vanilla cake of sorts with several different yummy sauces like caramel and chocolate and served with fresh fruit...the best part? The nuts... really well toasted and added just the right amount of flavor). We weren't offered/didn't get coffee, but that was ok. Additionally, we had our dinner over 1.5 hours... I feel like that is an appropriate amount of time for a coursed dinner, so that was a great improvement. After this experience, I can see us giving this restaurant another chance... we will be back!   PS After giving it some thought, I have concluded that the problem that we have experienced at this restaurant is largely due to communication. Had we been told there were issues in the kitchen and invited back another night from the beginning, that would have been acceptable (especially given the size of this operation and I do feel that it was not very fair that because of yelp we got a second shot but the other people there that night who most likely had the same experience probably didn't get the same treatment). Had we been informed at some point about menu changes, that would be ok too, but for some reason, things like this aren't disclosed at this restaurant. For example, the menu said chocolate dessert or pureed potatoes or whatever, if I were at a regular restaurant and ordered that, they would need to tell me, Oh I'm sorry, we've run out of that, but we do have something else. Why isn't that the case here? If there was one thing I think they should change, that would be it. Just a thought, but, as described, the food was far better last night and the follow up service was also very good, so they have that going for them"}
{"text":"Nice romantic restaurant with good food and drinks.  The menu is fixed with a choices for each course.  They have valet parking.  We will definitely come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"My wife and I are retired restaurant owners/operators from the Chicago area, a well respected white tablecloth establishment for the past 32 years, still going strong. Our first visit to Cafe Monarch, although accidental, uplifted our spirits on this Mothers Day. The greeting could possibly use a hint of sophistication, of professionalism if you will; cute young ladies dressed in black is not synonymous of \"class\". This being said, our main server Richard was a delight to deal with, educated, well travelled, well spoken....his table-side manners are impeccable and well suited to the class the Monarch aims to belong to. Other wait staff members seemed well versed on the menu as well. The setting, outside, was one of the most romantic and classy environment one can hope for when fine dining! The menu selections could be seen as a bit short but considering the menu gets altered every other week or so......good choices. Perhaps I was a bit disappointed to hear the lamb was from NZ.....since the restaurant prides itself on featuring seasonal and local foods as much as possible...well? Colorado lamb is of high quality and somewhat closer than NZ...right? The cuisine was at the level of a 1+ Michelin star in France, not bad from a \"self taught\" Chef if I understood well. This young man has a bright future if he keeps at it and does not burn the stages of betterment. Our bottle of Ruinart Rose Champagne was chilled to perfection, such a pleasurable sensation! Richard overheard it was our 50th anniversary; he brought a dessert with a sparkler, a nice touch indeed! Greeting: 4 stars       Menu choices: 4 stars      wine list /service: 5 stars Food preparation/presentation: 4 stars    Service: 5 stars    Ambience/decor/appointments: 5 stars       Value: 5 stars (not cheap mind you , but worth it!)"}
{"text":"All I can say is mind blown with this place.  Very romantic, very intimate and very unique.  If you are looking for a place to be romantic or celebrate a special occasion look no further.   Took my beautiful gf here to celebrate our 4 years together and we couldn't of asked for a better setting. The staff was beyond remarkable and our waiter was very helpful with us.  He surpised us with drinks of his choice recommended certain items went above and beyond.    Now the food is to die for,  the flavors, the way the plates were set up to us being told by the server what each dish entailed was phenomenal.  It's a pre fixed course and you could not go wrong with anything you choose.  To top it off they brought us dessert with a sparkler in it to celebrate our day.    We were pleased, happy and impressed and could not stop talking about this place.  We will be back and look forward to what it has in store for us next. Thank you to everyone there on making our day that much more special"}
{"text":"Totally agree with M M R's review.  Well done.  I'll try a short and sweet version:  One man band - Christopher does it all...and I mean all.  While food is fantastic, the experience is what makes this a one of a kind place.  Bring cash and your own wine.  Don't be picky, let him bring you what he is making.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Impeccable. Everything was absolutely phenomenal.  Gorgeous setting - we were lucky enough to be sat in the courtyard and it's breathtaking.  Service was top notch, timing was perfect, management was gracious and the food was utterly amazing. I honestly don't think I've ever had such a pleasurable dining experience.    The menu changes weekly and you can view it online before you make reservations. Its fairly costly, but worth every penny. Best restaurant Scottsdale has to offer in my opinion. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Scottsdale!!  Awesome service, amazing food, great atmosphere.  Watching Chef Chris maneuver about the kitchen and tables is like watching theatre...  I haven't posted to Yelp in quite some time, but this place made me get on here same day!!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch 03.20.11  1st visit to Cafe Monarch - very relaxed environment.  Plenty of parking spaces.  Chef Chris was very accommodating.  Chalk board on the sides of the entry way displayed the entree selection for the day.  There was a section for guests to sign in.  $20 includes tax/beverage.   CASH ONLY.  Pork Tenderloin and Bosc Pear salad were choices for the day.  Presentation - amazing.  Quality of ingredients - excellent.  Taste - superb.    Next visit will be for dinner.  Can't wait."}
{"text":"This place was outstanding all around.  You have earned your great reputation.  Our waiter Sam went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed.  He even gave us reccomendations of things to do in town.  We appreciate you guys and your greatness!"}
{"text":"First off, just walking into this place is like a fairy tale. Quaint, garden like setting it's perfect for a romantic evening. We ate outside on the terrace which was like a dream. I have a gluten allergy and they catered to this well. Our courses were cauliflower soup, salad, filet mignon and a gelato dessert...all exceptional! Also, the service was immpecable, just outstanding. I will also say even though my husband did not wear a jacket, the majority of men were. Their prices were very reasonable for quality and if I wasn't pregnant, the wine pairing sounded delicious."}
{"text":"It truly doesn't get any better than this. Having traveled the world for many years as something of a foodie I've rarely encountered a restaurant this close to perfect. Adjacent to its previous space the new location is a re-purposed professional building that has been beautifully appointed with all of the ambient touches you would expect in the finest of French restaurants. Upon entering we were treated like royalty by a staff that has been well schooled in the importance of the impressions they make. While we sere seated in luxurious comfort our waiter carefully explained the Monarch system which is a four course fixed price dinner priced according to the selected entree. Wine and dessert are extra, of course, as well as a few carefully selected and mouthwatering sides. Each diner in our party of four pretty much stayed with the same choices with a few exceptions. For openers we all tried the squash blossom relleno, unusual, delicious and not to be missed. For the second course there is a choice of a spring salad, which I'm told was excellent, and a yellow fin tuna crudo which I had and was nothing short of terrific. The third course was a choice between Heirloom Carrot Gnocchi and a pork roulade. I had the latter and it was a delicious warm-up for the main event. Three of us ordered the citrus crusted Chilean Sea bass and the other the crispy skin ora tuna. The tuna was reportedly outstanding. As for the sea bass, I can say that I have never been served a  more flavorful, just right sized and perfectly prepared piece of fish anywhere. The citrus crust was deliciously flavored and pleasantly crisp. The fish was soft and flaky, and I was sorry to see the last bit disappear off my plate. Dessert? Of course. There was a list of possibilities and being already stuffed we ordered one for each couple - a rum cake made in such a way that it is wonderful cake flavored with rum rather than the other way around. With a cup of delicious coffee it topped off the meal. The wine list is extensive. The connoisseur will not be disappointed. There are, however, many wines on this well-thought-out list that diners will find impressive and affordable. Honestly, this is the most complimentary restaurant review I've ever written so you would not be faulted for asking \"was there anything negative?\" Well, yes just one picky little thing. When our waiter served my second glass of wine from the carafe he had a plate in his right hand to deliver across the table. Instead of doing that first and coming around to face me as he should have done, he backhanded the carafe over my glass with his left hand and nevertheless made a perfect pour. In sommelier-land that maneuver is a no-no but I had to admire him for making it work. My conclusion is that if you have a special celebration or you are entertaining a very important guest or client Cafe Monarch is the place. In this town I don't believe you can do better."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to write my first review! Growing up in Phoenix, I just recently experienced this cozy and romantic restaurant. It has officially hit the top of my list as my favorite restaurant in Arizona. My boyfriend and I went to Cafe Monarch for a special occasion and we were blown away. The two of us being total food and wine lovers, enjoyed the carefully created and perfect wine paring set with an exquisite menu. The food was spectacular, the service was impeccable, and the ambiance was breathtaking. I could go on and on about my love for this family owned gem, but I'll leave the rest for your visit in the near future."}
{"text":"An absolutely perfect meal. Easily one of the most intimate dining experiences ever.  Chris is the ideal chef, modifying his masterpieces to create the ultimate bespoke meal that catered to my preferences.  Totally fairly priced, great setting, and food that will blow your mind. By all means necessary, make sure you find this little place when you're in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Delighted to have found this place. It's everything reviewers say:  romantic, cozy, and most importantly amazing food. Amuse bouche soup course dazzled (white asparagus with zucchini crab roll and tomato jam). The salad was a burst of fresh flavors -- watermelon, arugula, beets, hazelnuts. Entrees of filet mignon and halibut were equally inventive and high quality ingredients. Flourless chocolate cake was a sweet finish. Candlelight and attentive service. Wonderful find in Scottsdale. A memorable night."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday. 4-stars for the food, but I'm giving it 3 for the cost. It is really pricey, and it's unfortunate that one needs to spend this much money to have a quality meal in Scottsdale. The dishes were excellent and well plated. The wines were nice but not spectacular (not worth the $60 add-on to the pre-fixe menu). I would go back, but I'd go back a lot more if it were cheaper."}
{"text":"This is the first time I wish I could give more than 5 stars - I considered going through all my old 5 stars reviews and downgrading them because of Cafe Monarch. Our experience here was truly incredible.  I came with a group of 6 on a Saturday night for a celebration. We had possibly the best waiter I've ever had (can't remember his name, unfortunately) - extremely friendly, charismatic, knowledgeable, and just overall fun.  All of the food was amazing - ALL of it. Nothing specific to recommend. Get what sounds good to you and I promise it won't disappoint.  At the end of the meal, because we were celebrating, they brought out dessert with a sparkler and a little gift for us. I'll never forget our meal here."}
{"text":"The Monarch is a first class, 5* experience all the way around. From the light canopy on the patio to the romantic individual bistro tables, to the well-educated servers and wine sommelier. We visited for the first time for a birthday dinner (table for 2) and the experience lived up to the high expectations we had. The menu and wine pairings were *INCREDIBLE*. Our server, Chris, was very attentive, friendly and relatable, which made it that much more enjoyable. Be sure to book a reservation because you can't expect to just waltz in to the top Scottsdale restaurant and grab a table any night you want. It's worth the wait, and well worth the price!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! My friend called to see if we could get in on a Friday night but we weren't holding our breath. Much to our surprise the owner said he could fit us in at 7:30! Already 5 stars in my book!  When we arrived we were promptly seated at a table for 2 right next to this really cute, rustic wall fountain. The patio is adorable and the weather was perfect which made for a wonderful dining experience. Our waiter was very attentive and everything on the pre-fixe menu was to die for! So fresh and delicious.  When we finished our meal, the owner took us on a tour of the kitchen where we met the chef and were able to see how he made everything for our dinner, so cool! I will definitely be back to try out a different menu another night as well as brunch!"}
{"text":"Ours was a five-star experience here from the COURTYARD to the SERVICE to the FOOD! Richard was our waiter but the service involved a team of people. We have traveled to Europe and all over the U.S. and can honestly say that Monarch delivered our best dining experience ever.  Loved the background music too. We chose not to do the wine pairing offered; so our bill was far less than $150/per person as described by an earlier reviewer."}
{"text":"I walked into Cafe Monarch and knew instantly how my dream kitchen would look, how my dream restaurant would be laid out and how my dream clientele would be. We had called in advance to see if Chris could prepare a vegan meal, a request he gladly obliged, and we were welcomed warmly in various ways: 1) A lovely greeting from Chris, excited to meet the vegan with additional questions about how food can be prepared, 2) prompt opening of our bottle of red to get us started, 3) a cozy seat by the fire outside while he prepared appetizers.  The food was fresh and delicious, though I think he may have been timid and slightly insecure about not being able to cover anything on my plate with cheese. After an hour long post-dinner chat about vegan cooking secrets, he was (dare I say) excited about the idea of trying something completely new in the kitchen. So regardless of the food, which sounds odd because that's the main component of many of our reviews here, his contagiously friendly personality, openness and fervor for food were worth many more stars than this rating system will allow. Bravo and I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This place deserves more than 5 stars. We went for our 27th anniversary and you couldn't find a place any more romantic than this. We were seated in the charming and quaint outdoor garden. The food, a five course prix fix menu, was extraordinary. The presentation of each dish is artfully done, the flavors were a delight to the palate. Each dish is so unique and just needs to be experienced. I choose the double pork chop and it was so large, tender and juicy. I took 1/2 home for lunch the next day and it was still amazing. My husband choose the duck and he loved his also.  Richard, our waiter, was perfection. His explanation of the menu and the preparation of the food was exemplary. His attention to detail was awesome, he was attentive but not overbearing. All the staff is very professional. Because it was our anniversary we received complimentary champagne toasts at the beginning and a the crepe for dessert that was light and airy with fresh fruit. It is a little pricey but so very very good especially for a special occasion."}
{"text":"There are very, very few perfect dining experiences.  This was one.  Immediately, you are transported to a country château in the Loire valley when you walk in this place.  And then...the courtyard.  Candlelit, perfectly rustic and overgrown with vines and palms, and adorned with candles and chandeliers.  You just...forget, and you are truly transported.  And then there's the service.  Absolutely on point.  Professional, never obsequious, and ridiculously prompt.  My husband and I both had the filet and the diver scallops.  I mean, beyond perfect, both.  I can't say enough about how fabulous our experience was.  Vingt sûr vingt."}
{"text":"An amazing dining experience! The high level of service & atmosphere was only topped by the amazing food. I have recommended cafe Monarch to several friends.  I would easily rate a 10 star"}
{"text":"So after reading the reviews I made it my mission to come to this restaurant. I wanted dinner but bc of scheduling issues with my friends we decided on a bday brunch on Sunday. I am so glad we made it!! The food was AMAZING and Chef Chris was awesome. This place is a must do for any \"foodie.\" I can't wait to go back. Schedule your reservations as soon as you can bc this place books up fast which is no doubt because of the pure awesomeness of it. I already have 2 reservations for dinner this month!  Thanks Chef for a great bday celebration. Yours truly, the bday girl from the table of women who of course love bacon. Lol!!!"}
{"text":"My mom offered to take me out so we could have our own Mother's Day dinner, just the two of us. I picked Cafe Monarch based on Yelp and we couldn't have asked for a better experience.  The place itself is so warm and inviting. The patio is seriously magical with all the candles and greenery.  The food was equally as great. We checked the menu online before we made reservations to see what was on tap and the menu for the evening sounded really interesting. And it was.  It was $55 a person for the four courses and it was worth every penny. Our service was excellent and since we went a little early, we had the place to ourselves for almost an entire hour.  I will definitely be back and bring the husband for a date night. So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"An Oasis in the Desert!  My girlfriend and I have been meaning to try out this place for about a year now. Her and her fiance are moving to Australia next week so I sent her a text telling her we have to have a going away dinner and we had to try this place out before she left! So we double dated and all 4 of us were blown away.  We had a table in the courtyard which is just simply amazing. The word that kept coming to mind with the decor was \"quaint\" I don't know if that is the right word but I can't think of a better one! Loved it. You get a 4 course meal for $55 which for the quality and atmosphere is very reasonable. We all elected to add the $25 for the wine pairing (3 wines).  Each week is a brand new menu! One of the things that I loved was since there were no decisions to make except your meat (It is a pre fixed meal and you choose one of the 2 entree dishes) I tried ingredients and dishes I might have skipped over under other circumstances.   The Food-  We started with an Amuse Busch (spelling?) which was Lobster and Ricotta stuffed squash blossoms with a tomato curry sauce- FANTASTIC! Our next course was a watermelon and yellow beat salad with marcona almonds and a lemon vinaigrette - all the ingredients were so fresh.   For dinner my boyfriend got the Halibut and I got the Ribeye so we could try each dish. Normally I am not a big fish fan, not that I dislike it, I just like meat better! But this Hazelnut-Brown Butter Halibut was just superb! It was served with sauteed Wild Ramps, Roasted Sweet Corn, Forbidden Rice, Red Quinoa and Couscous, Cockle Clam Vinaigrette. It was served in a sort of \"patty\" next to the fish. All of it went great together! The Ribeye was sooooooo tender! Would give any steakhouse a run for their money! It was a 4 chili rubbed Ribeye (I ordered mine Medium Rare Plus and it was perfect). It was served sliced instead of whole and came ontop of a potato Leek-Lobster Hashbrown that has mushrooms and spinach in it. The other couple did the same thing (splitting the 2 meals) and were as equally estastic about it!  For desert we a White Chocolate Key Lime Tart with a Raspberry Sorbet. It was the perfect end to the meal!  For the Wines-   Our Amuse Busch and First Course was served with a French Chardonnay which complimented both dishes great. The Napa Blend (Hahn) was OUTSTANDING! I even ordered another glass and took note of the name so I could purchase it for my home! The dessert was accompanied with a desert white white served in a champagne glass, seemed like a cross between a Muscato and an ice wine but this was the only wine they didn't bring the bottle out for and I never asked what it was. We decided at the end of our meal to order a round of champagne to toast their moving to Australia and to Cheers to our fantastic evening at Monarch Cafe!   All of it was just superb and service was spot on! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time Saturday. It was with all certainty worth 5 stars. The food was delicious and the portions were just enough. The service was spectacular. And the decor was beautiful. Can not wait to go here again! A must try worth the $$$"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is relaxed and laid back. The menu, though limited, is outstanding. At first, I was worried when realized I basically had 2 choices that maybe neither would be vegetarian friendly, but I asked and was pleasantly surprised. The food was DELICIOUS. The coffee was great. The dining patio made me feel like I had stepped into some other world, away from the rest of Scottsdale. And I don't know if they put them there or not, but I saw several Monarch butterflies floating around the garden, which just added to the ambience. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Perfect date night for me and my husband. The atmosphere was beautiful, comfortable and warm. The staff from valet to hosts and waiter were all welcoming and polite. The food is outstanding! The menu had lots to choose from and everything was unique. The cauliflower soup and sea bass are one of a kind. One of my new favorite places and the menu changes all the time so we will be going back often."}
{"text":"My very favorite date night spot! Romantic atmosphere, delicious food, great wine pairings & cocktails & the service couldn't be better! Like dining in someone's beautiful home - this family run business makes you feel like a welcome guest in their home! Six stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Want a new favorite spot to celebrate life with great food, friends, your favorite wine and candelight?  This is it.  Call Christopher (your new best friend that can -really- cook), tell him what you like, and relax and let him work his magic.  The food, setting and ambiance are magnified by his passion for delivering perfect experiences, and you're sure to leave here feeling full, and lucky to have found this (on yelp no less...maybe this site is good for something!)  If you're on the fence, don't hesitate.  this is a winner.  Great for bunch, lunch or any special occasion, we also come for the best quiet time away from it all that we've had in ages.     If you're looking to chase the crowd to the next hot scottsdale eatery, or overpay for wine don't go here. (gotta love byob!)  Truly unique, If you find anything like this in AZ, please leave it in the comments, becuase we haven't."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to write a fantastic review of Cafe Monarch, but last night's dinner was almost a complete thumb's down.  I reserved a table here because it sounded like a special occasion, foodie, date night, but they had obviously overbooked, so the whole evening was extremely chaotic in the restaurant.  And because they overbooked, the rush to get us through our meal was palpable.  We had the prix fixe meal with wine pairings, and could barely finish one course's wine, before the waiter was appearing at the table, pouring the next course's wine.  On top of that, as the wine glasses piled up, they weren't taken away from our table.  As for the food, well, it was rather ordinary, except for a lovely first course gazpacho.  We could have made the salad at home with a bottled dressing, and the wine pairing was completely mis-matched.  The quid ink crepe was like a small, black tortilla filled with canned crab, and my duck entree was overcooked and uninteresting.  Finally, we had told them ahead of time that we share a birthday and were celebrating it at Cafe Monarch.  They looked embarrassed and brought us out a dessert with a sparkler.    Dear Cafe Monarch - only book enough to make each party's meal special and honor the food."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was good! The service was a bit dry but fine as well. I did find that the prices were a bit unreasonable"}
{"text":"Delicious food, intimate and romantic ambience, perfect experience.  I've never tasted sea bass like the one at Cafe Monarch.  It tasted like lobster!  The way it was prepared was unlike any other restaurant.  The wine pairing was perfect.  The cauliflower soup had me thinking about it for weeks.  And our server was professional, knowledgable, and charming.  This restaurant should be on your must go to list."}
{"text":"Wow!  Just wow!  Totally and utterly overrated.  I really wanted to believe the hype and hysteria.  I really did.   My best friend and I went there last week.  The menu was melon soup with lime sorbet, heirloom tomato and cheese salad, and either ribeye or curried fish.    First the atmosphere is fantastic, really quaint and romantic. The servers were well meaning too.    First course: the amuse Bouche soup. It was about two table spoons of melon smoothie that anyone with a Vitamix can make.  Oh but it had a dollop of lime sorbet on top and a colorful swirl of who cares.  It was like getting dessert as appetizer but much less satisfying.  Second course: the heirloom tomato and super sprout phenomenon salad.   It had three  one quarter inch thick half moon slices of tomatos, three pieces of cheese and three quarters of a pound of sprouts of some über micro green.  But to be fair it did have a shmear of some paste on the plate.  Basically tasteless, tomatoes were less than ripe and still very hard.   Really 55.00 for three slices of tomatoe, cheese and a handful of greens? Call me crazy but the value for a a foodie for food that tastes like my kindergartner made it is just not there.  Fail number two.    Third course entree:  I had the \"ribeye\" and my friend had the curried fish.  The ribeye was unlike any ribeye I've had.  It frankly wasn't ribeye.  It was three medallions of lean beef over black lentils and drizzled with who cares wine reduction.  Again very lacking on flavor, contrast, and flavor.  But seriously folks who doesn't love a bite of top round with a deliciously bland mouthful of lentils to deaden all your taste buds?  Oh and before I forget, after we ordered my friend noted to me they didn't ask how you wanted your steak cooked.  So the next time the server came 'round we asked why and said I want it rare.  The server (who I think is in training bc he seemed to have to ask the other server everything - which is fine better sad than sorry there's a sometimes steep learning curve in fine dining) said, \"the steak is cooked medium rare the way the chef wants it.\"  Now I haven't worked with Gordon Ramsey but I bet you a million dollars that he'd ask the patron for his opinion on the matter.  That said I still really think he was in training and forgot to ask and didn't want to go back to the kitchen and get yelled at for not asking etc.  Been there myself.  Fine medium rare will do just fine - the chef said so.    My friend's curried fish (I totally forgot what type of fish but I think it was mahi mahi) was the best dish of the night.  But it too was not that impressive.   I think I would rather hit malees for fish in curry sauce.  And again it had some lentil bland mound under the fish.    The final course was dessert.  We ordered two Lagavulin 16s on the rocks (it took a minute because the server had to ask the lead server to talk to is about scotch options) to go with the...oh wait the dessert was so unmemorable I forgot what it was.  I literally can't remember what it was.  But I do remember being unimpressed and saying to my friend the first course soup would've been a better dessert.    Lastly the bill.  The night before we ate at Mastro's In Scottsdale and had  a much much better bill to food ratio.  And I am a ravenous foodie and I understand small courses and I Know it's not a steak house.  My point here is that at the most expensive steakhouse in Scottsdale where the ribeye is 70 dollars or so and you know you are being plundered for meat you could buy at AJs and grill or put in your salamander you are still getting tastier food and more bang for your buck.  Or likewise if you went to Binkleys in cave creek your money would be So much better spent.  Food doesn't get masked and duct taped with lentils there.  And you could do 3 or 5 or 7 courses or just order off the menu AND Chef Binkley will take the time to ask if there is any special accommodations for allergies, taste profiles etc that he needs to change or modify for you.  Oh and it tastes amazing so you get your money's worth.  At cafe monarch (where the chef is king) they must be doing summer budget cuts and dialing the food down a notch as the snow birds leave and the locals get the table scraps, or maybe it was an off night, or maybe they just serve food that way I don't know but frankly it sucked.  TOTALLY AND UTTERLY OVERRATED AND UNIMPRESSIVE!   Oh and the ice cubes for our scotch cost $2.00 each.  That's right two dollars for frozen water put into a rocks glass.  Seriously, the budget must be really out of balance."}
{"text":"Can I just say? Impeccable from start to finish. It's very rare that we experience sheer perfection in a restaurant. We are big foodies and to be blown away is very rare. This  was a stunning surprise. I must admit when I heard about it, I was a little put off by a small menu choice but boy was I wrong! The food was outstanding, perfectly seasoned, the wine pairing exquisite and the restaurant truly deserves the \"most romantic ambiance\" title that it has been given. Service was impeccable! This will be our new go to in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner here today.  It was my birthday and I checked out this place on a whim.  Spoke to the owner and asked him for a reservation the night prior for 7-8pm.  We just had a cancellation he said at 7:30. Amazing, since this place takes orders 4 weeks in advance.  We were seated in a small area.  Table for two.  All by ourselves.  View of the moon and stars.  Occasionally saw waiters filling jugs of water and so forth, but no big deal.  I felt like I was in Europe.  Dinner. Amazing,  the review would be too long to write, but when I shared with friends they said amazing... Sounds like your house nick.  I chuckled saying yeah, pretty much.  Beautiful preparations, beautiful service, had a level three sommelier attend to our needs. Dinner was filling and real of the old country.    Two things.  They are NOT BYOB.  They do take CREDIT CARDS.  Don't listen to the previous reviews.  Will we return.  No doubt the most original conçept for cuisine if you want a real memorable meal.  Thanks Christian and Steven for making 39 years old a memorable year."}
{"text":"Shortly after I wrote my 3 star review, Christopher contacted me. He was very apologetic about our experience and wished that we had enjoyed our meal more.  He immediately offered to refund us the cost of the meal because we weren't 100% satisfied.  After discussing his offer with my friends, we decided to take a 50% refund.  Let me just say that I was personally a little uncomfortable with this because while I have received refund/free meal offers from other businesses in the past, I've never taken them up on it.  I don't think it's about the money and I certainly don't write reviews to elicit free meals.  However, since the 3 of us split the cost of the meal evenly, I felt that it would only be fair if I took my friends' suggestions into account.   Anyway, the refund check arrived in the mail yesterday.  I decided to upgrade my review to 4 stars given the overall experience.  It's rare to find business owners who value their customers as much as Christopher."}
{"text":"Where do I start with the Cafe Monarch experience?  I guess at the beginning.  Last winter a good friend took me to lunch at Cafe Monarch and it was love at first bite.  Christopher, the owner/chef/server/bon vivant and everything came over and described all the choices, but I asked if I could have the bacon/fig/pepper club sandwich as a salad.  He said yes and it was LOVE!!!!  So, now the food makes you misty and so does Christopher.  Most salads can start off well, but about halfway through you are thinking that while good, it's the same thing again. Every bite of Christopher's salads is a new experience, from start to finish.  One bite might be savory and sweet, the next crunchy and spicy. You cannot believe that a salad can have that many fabulous permutations, but it does and it happens every time.  And if there is hummus, don't even get me started!!!  After that first experience, Christopher and Cafe Monarch became my MUST EAT place. The setting is intimate and artsy and European and funky and just plain FUN!!! The food combinations are seemingly endless and it never disappoints.  I spent my birthday there with my husband who is a picky or some might say \"fussy\" eater.  He doesn't like sauces or too many combinations and on and on.  I was a bit worried that the birthday evening could devolve into something unpleasant if he didn't love it as much as did I, but there was no need to worry because he LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it.  It was one of the best birthdays ever.  This led us to beg Christopher (yes, we were willing to beg) to return a bit early from his summer closing to create the perfect birthday dinner for my husband's BIG birthday. I won't say the age, but it was one of THOSE birthdays where you want to make sure it is special.  We had 17 people for what everyone has described as the most magical evening they have experienced, perhaps ever or at least rarely.  People that I would never have expected to \"get it\" were immediately bowled over by the ambiance, the intimacy and the fun that prevailed.  When someone asked me after the fact how I would rate the experience on a scale of 1 to 10, I said without hesitation 400!!!  In life we often want things to match our pictures, this so far exceeded our pictures of the evening that it at times defies description.    When you are at Cafe Monarch you feel you are at home or at the home of a dear, intimate friend.  If food is love, then this is the place of boundless love.  I have just finished lunch there today and will be heading back on Saturday for our anniversary.  For us, it is the best \"go to\" place in the Valley and I have lived here a long time and eaten a lot of great food."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience for me.  I had planned all winter to visit this resto.  My friend and I kept trying to set a date that would work in Mar/Apr this year.  With it being the high season here in AZ, we had to book about 4 weeks in advance to get a decent seating time on a weekend night.  So, we booked our date.  A week out, my friend has a family situation that came up and could not make it.  Well, I waited all that time (not including the time it finally took for us to settle on a date) I sure as hell wasn't going to cancel the dinner JUST because my friend could not go.    Ok, so this is definitely not the type of place one would expect to see a woman sitting along eating dinner.  NO WAY.  This place has the most romantic, quiet and beautiful patio dining room.  With it being April, the patio dining room was in full effect and in walks ... ME.. solo.  Dressed to the nines in my 5 inch heels and dress and etc as if I were meeting someone.. Nope... table for 1.  I am seated right away and this is when I began to really sit back and enjoy myself.  Every person that came to my table called me by name, Ms D, can I get you some more Tea?  Ms D, how was the this and Ms D, can we get you a that?  Oh man, all that fuss over me made me feel like a true princess.  Chef Chris even came by twice and commented that he was happy I had decided to come anyway.  I was too.  My meal was very good.  A week or so before the dinner, Chef Chris personally called me to ask what types of foods we didn't like and what we liked.  I said Chilean sea bass is my favorite fish and I generally enjoy fish.  I forgot to mention that the only thing I really HATE is fennel and caraway seeds - like PLEASE DO NOT PUT THAT IN MY DISHES.  How I manged to forget that important detail is beyond me!    So its the dinner night....   On my drive to dinner, I remember thinking to myself, how could I forget that i HATE fennel and caraway seeds.  I thought, what are the chances that he would have fennel or caraway seeds in the dish?  I shrugged it off and thought, \"naaaah\".  Get to dinner and discover they had Chilean Seabass (Yeaaa!) with, you guessed it, blanched fennel and etc.  My heart sank because I don't really eat beef, which was the other option.  so, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.  I figured I could possibly remove anything with fennel in it and just eat the fish.    To my surprise, the fish comes out and, you guessed it, I LOVED it.  Fennel and all.  I was shocked.  I ate EVERY bite of that fish.  Chef Chris told me that blanching fennel calms down the flavor and he was right.  It was actually extremely pleasant.    Any place that can make me like fennel and cause me to start cooking the fennel in my CSA basket at home deserves a minimum 4 stars.  They get a bonus star for the stellar service.  I think I will return for a b'day dinner... alone in the next couple of weeks.  I'm due for some food pampering.    Bravo Chef Chris and staff!"}
{"text":"This was our second time to enjoy this restaurant. We first came for our anniversary then again last night for my wife's birthday. We have such an amazing experience the first time that there was no question where we'd celebrate the birthday.  We were fortunate to have Richard as our waiter/concierge (as I like to put it) he is clearly happy to be part of the experience at Cafe Monarch. He is very knowledgeable and helpful and always available without being overbearing.   You'll notice I haven't said a thing about the food up to this point. The reason is this restaurant is as much about creating the perfect evening as it is about the food. It is people like Richard who fulfill that mission. Thank you Sir. We got lucky last night as he was with us one more time.  The food...I can't articulate how amazing the food is. Simply incredible! On our first visit I enjoyed the Trio and last night the Tomahawk.   On your next special occasion, give Cafe Monarch a try. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"This restaurant mostly trades on the beauty of the building and not on the quality of the food or the service. Wait staff was attentive but disinterested. The food was not as impressive as expected. I had the shrimp fra biablo and there was no spice. Our cappuccinos came with a packet of sugar..most higher end establishments use sugar cubes.  We were not offered a choice of dessert although it was a good cake. Small things but they don't go unnoticed. We had 2 dinners in Scottsdale, one at Kai and one at Cafe Monarch, and Kai was the clear winner. If you're looking for a true culinary experience go to Kai, but Cafe Monarch is a good option in old Scottsdale for a decent dinner in a beautiful building."}
{"text":"I wavered between a 4 or 5 star and finally ended up at 5. Not only was our meal delicious but the atmosphere is incredible and the whole dinner was memorable. Having come from a small town in the Midwest, I didn't grow up with places or patio's like this (especially not ones you can sit on in January or February) and every time I stumble across one in Phoenix, I act like a kid in a candy store and take 20 pictures of everything and just get HAPPY. The ambiance of the patio was something out of a dream to me. Lots of greenery and vines, pieces of neat decor, and LOTs of candles.   My fiance and I came here with another couple for her birthday dinner and I was so happy that Cafe Monarch was where she chose to go! We had discussed Different Point of View or Elements at Sanctuary but ended up here as it was closer to our after dinner plans at Mabel's on Main. While this place might seem better suited for a romantic dinner for two, it also worked pleasantly well for a table of four. It has been bookmarked on my Yelp forever and it seemed like the type of place that warrants a special night out.   I had been a bit hesitant about the menu since its a limited offering every night but we had the perfect meal when we were told a beef tenderloin filet was offered that night. My FAVORITE! The other meal was scallops. Our waiter was attentive and kept us good on drinks the whole evening. The time between courses was slow but I think they intentionally do that to make the dinner an event rather than trying to turn over the tables quickly. Since we had plans for after dinner, we asked if they could pick up the pace and they definitely did, so the effort was really appreciated.   The filet had a coffee rub on it and a nice sauce over the steak that I enjoyed a lot. So many times you go to Capital Grill, Ruth's Chris and the like and get a big steak but not a lot of other flavors or seasonings on it. While some may say that's the way a steak should be served, sometimes it's nice to switch it up. The filet was 8oz and was very tender and cooked perfectly and I thought the sauce complimented it very well. The salad and dessert were both good too and I would jump at the chance to come back here again. It may even be at the top of my list when my parents visit in April. Definitely has the WOW experience for me!"}
{"text":"SUPER romantic spot my husband took me to for my birthday. We had requested to sit outside, although due to high demand we were seated at an intimate table indoors. The atmosphere is so cute, and the food was great! We loved how they offered a wine pairing option, although for the price we decided to order a bottle of wine instead. It is a four-course menu with little options, but everything we ordered was amazing! I'd highly recommend this spot for special occasions."}
{"text":"There is no finer dining in Scottsdale. If you miss Cafe Monarch in your travels or if you are a resident in the Valley of the Sun, you have simply not lived. The exquisite food, the sultry and romantic ambience, and impeccable service are unmatched anywhere. You have never been engaged by a service staff like this. Take a vacation for an evening and feed your soul - it is long overdue."}
