{"text":"Best breakfast (Trucker's) in Mimico and great coffee. Attention to detail with the breakfast is impressive........real butter and the beans are excellent. Everyone is very friendly, a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"TL;DR Food: Solid standard breakfast.Yummy jam. Service good.

As far as a standard breakfast goes, Margo's did rather well. I'd give it a 3.5 but it's closer to 4 than to 3. 

Given the early nature of our visit, we were in the mood for breakfast, but the lunch items are rather enticing and though it is a little hole-in-the-wall on Lakeshore, the lunch specials evoke a certain creativity. Today's was a mac'n'cheese alla arrabiata or roast chicken with fixings.

I ordered the Trucker's Breakfast which was very standard through and through. Hearty, everything perfectly cooked, satisfying. I saw spicy mayo on the menu and had to order a side of that for homefries. It was quite decent. They had a kids breakfast option which was nice, and even accommodated my youngest by slicing up half an avocado. The most interesting item was the homemade jam, that I think was strawberry rhubarb. Delicious. It was not overly sweet and had an almost creamy quality to it. The coffee was all espresso based (for drip coffee aficionados, that means you order an americano) with soy and almond options.

Service was good. Rapid, efficient, informative. There were books for the kids, which was nice. I'd like to return to try some of the lunch specials and that fresh-fried chicken wrap."}
{"text":"I came here for  hang over breakfast and fell in love. The service was excellent, coffee was superb, food was standard breakfast with some fantastic fruit. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"What we had: 1) Tucker's breakfast and hot chocolate and 2) Breakfast Poutine and americano

Great cute spot in South Etobicoke. Menu includes all day breakfast and a range of poutine, as well as a variety of other great offers, such as zucchini latkes and a bunch of sandwiches.

Service is very friendly, prices are good. 

There are a lot of vegetarian options although we did not opt for those. 

Notable food comments for tucker's breakfast: \"jam is really good\", \"is this pulled pork in my beans? (yaas)"}
{"text":"Saw that Margo's just opened in the neighbourhood so I stopped in for a quick bite.

Apparently the hot item is the bacon poutine but since I was rocking skinny jeans and not my comfy pants I opted for the chicken wrap instead.   

First off, great chicken, all white meat, breaded and fried right then and there, none of this frozen garbage the lazy chefs are using these days.  The wrap was delicious, included fresh lettuce, tomatoes and spicy house made mayo.

Can't beat the price and taste...will be back for sure to try the poutine, I'm rooting for this place to make it!"}
{"text":"Ive been to this place a few times. Their items are freshly made and taste great. I ordered the chicken wrap today with some fries on the side.  The wrap was the best wrap ive ever had. The homemade mayo was simply delicious. 
However i find it a little bit overpriced for a place that just opened. Wrap+fries came to about 11$.  Not cheap for the size and amount of fries.  (Which i believe are not homemade)."}
