{"text":"Make my words! When you get down to brass stacks, it does not take a rocket science to savor a good Filipino food. It is clear that whoever makes the foods at LJ Kusina, the chef (and its staff) deserves the Order of Canada for an outstanding level of talent and exceptional contribution of service in the Markham region. Okay, maybe that is an over overstatement, but sometimes you just have to swallow and accept the facts.  The feeling of being so unrealistically content, and that a perfect life and food can exist is far beyond anything I could have ever perceived. LJ Kusina is my savior and meaning for existence.   Overreactions aside, I love eating their traditional Filipino food especially their flavorful pork sinigang on top of their chopped garlic flavored fried rice. Their meat lumpia is just as great, their pork barbeque sticks dipped in vinegar is incredible, and of course, their 5-inch tall halo-halo - amazing dessert to combat the summer heat."}
{"text":"I liked it very much, I had a tamarind soup with shrimps. The cost of a meal and drink for my mum and I was about 24 dollars altogether, and the server was very helpful and found us just what we wanted. My mum's pork was also quite nice and tender, so I have no complaints, though the portion of soup I got was perhaps a bit too much and it would be nice to be able to order different soup sizes like you can in many Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"Good tasting filipino food at a reasonable price.  The owners of LJ are very polite and kind.  Watch out for the crispy pata and the palabok - very addicting.  The deco, although nice and modern, seems a bit out of place and does not seem to match the culture of the food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and ambiance. Not bad for a Filipino restaurant, my sister and I were like, ummm are you sure this place is not that expensive? The price of the food were reasonable considering the fact that it was made to order but the taste? Umm yeah you can take it back and I'll pay for it.   We ordered sisig, pork barbecue, and rice. The sisig - oh don't get me started. I've tasted better sisig. Remely's Sisig is shitty but I'd rather have that anyday instead of what I got from here. BBQ? it was alright, it was too sweet but it was okay.  Anyways all in all, I give this place 5 stars for the decor and atmosphere, 3 for the price and 0 for the taste. I was excited to go to this place especially with the fact that its so close to my house, but from the looks of it, the best Filipino restaurants out there in my opinion is still on the Bathurst/Wilson area, and I still would not mind spending extra money for gas to go there.  Why am I so critical? I grew up with a mother, a set of aunts and cousins who are all in the lines of business of catering, food and nutrition, and even eateries (carinderia's) in the Philippines. I've tasted THE BEST Filipino food growing up. But with life being so busy, its no longer possible for me to get them."}
{"text":"I love this place. My aunts and uncles took me here for dinner when we went to visit from 'Mercia hahah don't worry I love Canada too. We had the crispy pata, chicharon, bistek, all kinds of pancit and of course halo halo at the end. The thing that separates this place from your traditional Filipino restaurants is the atmosphere and the presentation. Filipino food gets a bad wrap because people eat with their eyes and lj fixes that. I also like how their food is not dripping with grease. All around a great experience, with great food and great company. Don't know why the ratings are low."}
{"text":"This is ultra cheap, clean, well kept and really decent quality. Try the pork sisig and you will never regret. There is of course, halo halo, which is a filipino restaurant must have. I had it was delicious. There are some efficiency opportunities (business speak) but I had a great experience over all. Will definitely come back.   For ten of us, we padi $ 170 for a humongous feast. You can't beat that."}
{"text":"When I saw the photos of LJ Kusina on the Internet, I knew I must be here before... Chili Mango http://www.yelp.ca/biz/chilli-mango-markham!!  Nothing had changed much. Decor left untouched and I sat at the same booth I ate before... looking at a different menu.  LJ Kusina offers All Day Combo for $6.99. That has a good selections of different protein: Chicken/Beef/Pork/Fish with a side order of mixed vegetables and rice.  Afritada Chicken($6.99)  - chicken cooked in tomato sauce where dark meat was used and you can have a choice to have the kitchen prepare it spicy... - The chicken though tender and quite moist but quite a few pieces won't cooked all the way through!!  Special mention is the fried whole fish that the gentleman ordered at the other table, it smelled so good and I almost have an urge to ask him \"Can I take a Photo?\"  Halo Halo ($5.99) - Ube ice cream made in house is a lot lighter and not as sweetening as the standard one I experienced at other restaurants - I found the whole order was basically shaved ice with hardly anything.... it was a little disappointing!!!  The Filipino ladies working here were so friendly. Even the owner came over and asked me how was the food and we started talking about ice cream as she was the one that made all those mango, coconut and ube flavours!  I told her I just want MORE ice cream...  :) Maybe next time!!"}
