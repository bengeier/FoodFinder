{"text":"A great Brampton find for Italian food! I had my first visit earlier this week and I can't wait to go again.  Decor is a little outdated There is no bar area, or draft beer  Service was a little sparse at times But the food was great  We came here on a recommendation and we were told to just order off the specials board. And trust that you can find something for anyone on the board, including lots and lots of seafood! I was surprised it was so busy for a weekday night.  For apps we ordered: Spicy scallops and Portabello mushrooms  Scallops were perfection, loved the sauce and easy on the spice. Scallops were mixed with onions and beans with a side of greens. Definitely loved the beans for the different textures Wasn't too crazy about the cheese sauce the mushrooms were in though. I love mushrooms but wouldn't order this again.  Entrees were: Lobster linguini and Seafood risotto  Pasta was good, good portion. Personally I would've loved more lobster, but who wouldn't? Risotto was awesome. Came out super hot and had a generous portion of seafood (squid, scallops, mussels and shrimp) yum!"}

{"text":"The food here was excellent and the service was even better!! My favorite dish was the 'Spicy Scallops'...the scallops were cooked to perfection.  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I would have give this place s 5 stars if it wasn't for the ridiculous wait for the food. And when i say ridiculous,  i mean at least an hour wait. However,  food is amazing and generous and that's the only reason why we keep coming back. Great authentic italian food with huge portion. Also, the BEST panna cotta ever!!!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food! Must try their specialty, osso bucco."}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing service.. best Italian restaurant I have ever been to. Plates/Bowls are huge. Olive oil and bread on the table .. very nice.   The only Italian food that is better is my mother in laws real home made pasta and pepper sauce."}
