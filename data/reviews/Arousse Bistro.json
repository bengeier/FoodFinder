{"text":"Just returned from this absolutely delicious restaurant and had to write this review so more people can discover the wonderful tastes and experience the atmosphere! We came on a beautiful evening and sat on the terasse, enjoying wine and Lebanese beer. I had the shish taouk platter, which came with delicious rice with a hint of cinnamon, a really wonderful tabouli, and small servings of hummus, baba ganoush, and garlic sauce. It was a perfect way to try everything! I went in thinking I would have leftovers, but it was so good I ate it all! My husband really enjoyed his chawarma wrap and side of fries. I found it a bit odd that they had poutine on the menu, but the fries would make the perfect poutine fries that we will certainly be back to try!   In an area with so many restaurants, I am very glad we tried this one!"}
{"text":"We ventured out on the coldest night to sample the menu at this very charming and contemporary Middle Eastern bistro. It was so cold that my iPhone freaked out and the battery went into hibernation so I couldn't take any pictures of the delicious food. Overall the menu was very interesting with options for both  omnivores and vegans Most  of the items that we ate were excellent and the middle eastern version of poutine with haloumi cheese. (What else on such a cold night ?) was a standout. The Tajines of eggplant and beef were incredibly delicious and well seasoned. This place has great potential. Its a welcome addition to St Denis which has been on the decline in the last few years. The staff is exceptionally nice. We will definitely return and can't wait for the warmer months when we can enjoy Arousse Bistro on the terrasse.   Another cold night and we ventured to return for another fun meal and to photo capture the yum."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is a jewel, it is fine libanaise cuisine, you have some for everyone. Large selection for vegan and vegetarian people but also some very tasty meal for meat and fish lover."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for an early dinner here and it was very good! I love Lebanese food, so I was very familiar with the menu. I ended up getting grape leaves that came with hummus, tabbouleh, rice, and baba ganoush. It was all very good, although I was surprised that I got the tiniest bit of baba ganoush and wished for more because it was delicious. My boyfriend got the falafel and said it was very delicious. A really nice restaurant with friendly staff and a good menu for all kinds of diets (vegetarian, meat eater, etc.)."}
