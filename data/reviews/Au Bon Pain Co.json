{"text":"The food was good but the service was not. It seemed that the manager was doing more effort to serve us food than the attendant. My experience with the au bon pain on Boston was so far much better than this time."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Au Bon Pain in general, but this one in particular is the worst. I walked in to find every employee on their phone, yelling across the store to eachother. Worse, yet, the entire store, from the door way, smelled of vomit. I made it to the line, but had to turn around as the smell was so pungent. I cannot speak to the product, but I can say, I would never go in there again."}
{"text":"Offers what you'd expect from the Au Bon Pain chain.  Recent changes in how the sandwhich section works are a welcome improvement.  Their breakfast offerings are decent for the prize, while I've also heard their salads are pretty good.  This particular location while not the prettiest does have good employees and tends to manage rush traffic rather well."}
{"text":"There are so many Au Bon Pains to choose from they can't all be gems.  This location just so happens to be my most frequented because it's located in my office building.  I have noticed the bananas lately have been brown.  It's happened twice to where my banana was rotten on the inside.  I like the oj I think it's great but the pastries are not well stocked. To me it seems that no matter when I go in be it early or be it late they're always out of something.   Au Bon Pain use to have a brie, grapes and cracker offering but I haven't seen it in a really long time. They also use to do a mozzarella with pesto and tomatoes in the little to go container they stopped selling that too.  With Au Bon Pain the quality is failing."}
{"text":"I just had my first au Bon pain two days ago that my BF brought me to the office and it was amazing. I LOVE the smocked salmon bagel. Today I went get some breakfast to this store. It was EMPTY! They have a few bread, muffin left on the shelf. I went to the counter to get a smocked salmon and they were out of the onion bagel. So they asked me if they could use plain bagel, then I realize behind the glass shelf they only had 2 kinds bagel and I think it was like two of each. But I said yes cz I believed their brand name, besides it won't make a huge difference. The lady after me was asking for a wheat bagel and they didn't at it either. But, it was 9am in the morning, how could you out of every kind of bagel at this time? And I believe it is a store claim that they serve all day breakfast! Anyway, I have nothing to complain about the service, the stuffs were nice and friendly. after came back to my office, I was so excited to have my breakfast since I can still remember how good it was last time I had it. OMY, it was HARD when I started to eat! The bagel was just simply over toasted! I had to be really careful to bite it slowly and take small bites because it was just that hard. The cream cheese and salmon were still good, give it that were made in their factory. The store stuff only need to toast the bagel and put them together. I guess that was very hard to do. I will not go back to this store ever. Maybe the EQT building store. That is where my first bagel came from."}
{"text":"I eat at ABP usually at least twice a week while in Pittsburgh, PA. I usually go to the location down the street, but there is an ABP in 600 Grant St. that I go to for convience. I order the same thing usually, Thai Chicken Salad and recently, I've switched to a different dressing as a substitute. Most locations, either in Pittsburgh or in New York, will just mix Srichacha and BBQ sauce, as requested. The location in 600 Grant St. every time gives me a hard time and berates me for doing so. This is not a difficult or complex request; instead of the Thai Peanut Sauce, just add the BBQ & srichacha sauce. Upon asking for this, I was told \"No.\" When I asked why, I was told \"We don't do that.\" Upon further inquiry, your staff did not have an adequate response and repeated, \"We don't do that. Other locations SHOULDN'T, and we don't.\" This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. If you want to charge me extra for the mixture of sauces, fine. But I was not given this option, instead, I was told flat out \"No.\" I am furious that I ever have write such an idiotic complaint, but this is just ridiculous.  Go ahead. See for yourself. If you like the Thai Chicken Salad, and enjoy srichacha and BBQ sauce (it's a great combo), order it and see the ensuring madness."}
{"text":"Had a Thai peanut and chicken salad. Very good. The only thing I would change is I would add almonds. The dressing was delicious. It was fresh and the service was great. I love au bon pain and even though they're pricey I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Even though I'm not the biggest fan of this chain, simply because of the food quality and taste, I really enjoyed and appreciated great customer service over here.   So if you like sandwiches and soups, this is a good spot for a quick and easy lunch. My favorite part is that you can take the food outside (upstairs) where are many tables to sit and you can enjoy listening to the sound of water in water fountain. I loved that!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time. It's in the lobby of my work building downtown and can be accessed by anyone. They recently did a $3 off purchases of $10+ promotion which was great. I got the Thai chicken salad and broccoli and cheddar soup. I was able to pay while they made it so lines are not an issue.  The salad is chopped well and so far I've enjoyed the Southwest and Cobb salads too and some of their baked goods. Red velvet cookie was my fave.  The staff are friendly and learn a lot of the customers names. The food is easily transported with little concern of spillage, or the seats are a good option. ABP also has its own WiFi network for free.  I will certainly return for more salads and soups and eventually try the wraps too!"}
{"text":"Love this ABP! Far superior to the PPG food court. This was my favorite breakfast spot on my walk from the bus stop to the office. GREAT oatmeal and great croissant breakfast sandwiches. Love the coffee. Hazelnut blend with honey and cream FTW!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Au Bon Pain downtown. As with any Au Bon, I'd recommend the grab-and-go options (bagels, yogurt parfaits, danishes, etc.) over their other offerings. If the lines are short, the sandwiches are okay, but I don't think they're worth the wait.  This particular location is small, and while the bakery goods are usually stocked pretty well, the cold items (like yogurt, etc.) are really hit-or-miss. I can't count the number of times I've gone here looking for their greek yogurt parfait and the shelves were bare. There's no rhyme or reason to when the shelves are stocked, either.  The saving grace for this location is the staff, which is generally very nice, but service can be slow and the checkout lines can get long very quickly when too few people are on the registers to handle the rush (this is a common occurrence at this location)."}
{"text":"They don't serve the Spinach Croissant so this was a no go for mom. They also did not have the lentil soup and she was told they did not have that soup all week.  It is questionable as to whether they will have it Monday. Mom might go back sometime, but its doubtful.  The one advantage is that this place is open Saturday from 10 - 15:00."}
{"text":"This location is the worst downtown in my opinion. My biggest issue is that it does not seem as though they keep things stocked adequately to survive the daily rushes (that you would think they'd be expectant of by now and have a game plan for how to keep up), and often times everything is out at once. Despite the convenient location, I rarely go here anymore because they usually don't have what I'm looking for anyhow."}
{"text":"I visit this location the most since it's in the building where I work.   I belong to their eclub and had a $2 off of $7 offer.  This is a good deal since their food prices are a little high. I ordered the Southwest Chicken salad. They are kind enough to let me swap out cucumbers and corn for roasted red peppers and carrots.  There was a citrus lime vinaigrette dressing suggested for it but I opted for lemon shallot vinaigrette. You can get your salad dressing on the salad or on the side. The salad also comes with a baguette or other bread choice. I chose the new sprouted grain roll. (I gotta get my grains in somehow). The salad is enough for two meals!"}
