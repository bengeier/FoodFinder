{"text":"Horrible bar and grill. DO NOT GO. Got scammed

Headed over to this bar after work (6ish), and the place was half full inside. Immediately noticed that the place is really warm, probably in the high 20s with a lack of air circulation. Asked to move to the top fmfor more ventilation... no issues. 

After we sat down and asked ordered a beer with wings special, the waitress came back and told us that wings are not discounted during 'busy hours'. No where online or in the bar shows this restriction... and that we had the pay original price... should have told us BEFORE you served us our beers or even sat down. The bar wasn't even full and there weren't games going on at acc or rogers centre... 

Service was mediocore but place is way too warm and I felt scammed after that experience. Restaurants cannot just make up a rule all of a sudden..."}
{"text":"Went to Hoops just before a Jays game. Was really hungry, so I ordered a slam dunk burger. Umm.. No.
There was no flavour. Even with the bacon and cheese, still bland and not worth the price.  
Some of my coworkers had their poutine, which they said was pretty good
The wait staff were great, however they might want to check id.
Turns out one of my coworkers was underage and was served alcohol."}
{"text":"This place is mostly empty. I wonder if its the manager's attitude that keeps the place empty!! Lol.
They have no understanding of customer service. Wondering how long can they survive :)"}
{"text":"Flat beer and dirty glasses.  It's a \"sports bar\" will extremely loud dance music.  

I guess it's a \"sports bar\" Toronto style...."}
{"text":"I opened this Yelp account just to write this review.

If you are looking for service of ANY kind, do not go here. Stopped by after the Leafs game on Halloween night, well before the \"post-game rush\". The place was practically empty. We grabbed a two-person booth in the bar area. We were sitting there for 10 minutes and not one waitress acknowledged our presence. Plenty of them walked by, but not one of them stopped at our table. One of them was just standing right at the end of the bar with a sour look on her face, a few feet from our table, I can only assume she saw us sitting there. After 15 minutes we got up and left, but not before voicing our displeasure with the service. We walk to the front of the restaurant and discover five or six waitresses all standing together talking. Again, the place was practically empty but not one waitress came over to serve us. Obviously they were too busy talking to each other. When we voiced our complaints to them about the service, all they could do was stare at us with blank looks on their faces. One of them even gave us dirty looks. Just terrible. The waitresses all seemed to have contempt for the customers. Not sure how a restaurant expects to be successful with such awful service and servers. Management might want to invest in some waitresses who don't consider it annoying or a nuisance to actually serve people. The only thing this place has going for it is its location, and the fact that Real Sports is so busy on game nights that it forces people to go here. It has no redeeming qualities, as you can see from the many reviews below mine that say the same thing. Without even eating a bite, I know I will never be returning here and I will definitely share my awful experience with friends and online. The person I was with also writes for a food blog, and she will definitely be sharing our awful experience with her many readers. Terrible customer service is not a brush that any restaurant wants to be painted with.

Also, the table we were seated at was dirty with crumbs, the menus were sticky, and the restaurant had an unpleasant, musty smell. Do yourself a favour and go to Real Sports instead. It may be more pricey and busy, but at least you'll actually get some service, the food is great and it is spotless - everything this place is not. I didn't even want to give it one star."}
{"text":"Always been quite satisfied anytime i have ever come to this place. Staff were always friendly, attentive, and personable. I have been quite satisfied ever since making this place my after work \"haunt.\" Could not ask for better staff whether it be the employees or management. All have treated me like gold since the day I walked through the doors."}
{"text":"If you drink beer, I probably wouldn't go here.  The staff are super nice though. If you would like to know more, sit at the bar at the raps and watch the show."}
{"text":"Chose this place because of how close it is to the CN Tower and Aquarium and wanted to grab a quick bite. By \"quick bite\", I was thinking easy pub food, enjoy the patio for an hour and be on my way. Hoops is not the place I had in mind. 

To be fair, we were seated quickly, and had a n amazing view of the CN Tower on the patio. Drinks were taken relatively quickly. But from then on it was a downward spiral. 
Cons: 
1. Dirty tea cups. Lip stick stained and my mother actually had to get up and hand the dirty cup to the waitress for a new one.  
2. Customer Service. Many of the waitresses mumble, rarely give eye contact, and not very polite. Gives an unwanted feeling to the guests. 
3. Waiting time. Only 4 of us seated and we all ordered basic pub food, burgers, wraps, chicken. But almost an hour wait for the food. Not sure what happened there. 

Overall, Hoops doesn't have slam dunk potential. Go for the booze."}
{"text":"this is the worst place i have been in my life, they stole my personal property, and ruined my id, i am from out of the country and this is completely unacceptable behavior from a supposedly professional establishment. i would never suggest you try this place if it could have zero stars it would. terrible food, awful drinks and beyond the worst service i have ever experienced. do not try this place!"}
{"text":"Went in after Jays game, seated right away and then the wait was on... 20 minutes later I asked a passing waitress if she was our server, she said she was and left without taking our order... So we left! Then politely expressed our concerns to the manager and he just gave us the long stare! A 45 minute waste of time. Can't comment on the food or the drinks, sorry!"}
{"text":"Used to be a decent place that I frequented a lot just a few years back. They've done a whole lot of renovations but the thing I feel the most is that the service is terrible now besides the vibe being less sportsbar(y). It wasn't the greatest before but at least you got the order in and had your fill of pub stuff. I was basically sitting around staring at screens and my phone before anyone bothered to get my order and get me what I wanted. Last time I'm coming here."}
{"text":"Service was very slow- our waitress forgot about our pitcher of beer for the longest time. But once the food came (wings and nachos) we didn't have any complaints! Good place to watch the game, but there were some TV's that didn't work"}
{"text":"After some sightseeing, some friends and I stopped at Hoops because it was nearby and cheaper than the shit they sell at the CN Tower. It was hardly the experience we were hoping for. They sat us down and then proceeded to take 15 minutes to bring us drinks. We were so close to walking out and in hindsight, we would have been so much better off doing so. After waiting some more, they took our order. I had the chicken fingers with a side of gravy and my wife had fettuccine Alfredo. Waited forever again. Brought out the food and they had forgotten my side of gravy. That's fine, maybe they just forgot to write it down. What's worse though, is that their fettuccine Alfredo was neither fettuccine nor was it Alfredo. It was more like spaghetti. She said it was cold and tasteless. The whole time we're \"enjoying\" our meal, the section next to us is filthy. Not a single person came to clean it up the entire time we were there. All the waitresses were talking at a table in the back. Not once did they come to see if our food was okay or if we needed refills. The table next to us was full of loud, obnoxious people who clearly had too much to drink with no regard for anyone around them. The waitstaff did nothing about it. After sitting, not eating our food for another ten minutes, we finally flagged down someone to give us our bill so we could get the hell out. Looking at the bill, they charged us over 90 dollars, including $2 for my side of gravy that I never received and $8 dollars for drinks that we never ordered. This place thinks it can get by on having young girls with their bits hanging out and not giving good service. This was anything but a slam dunk!"}
{"text":"Completely and utterly insulted by your waitress. ...whenever I pay a bill with my debit card I always leave a cash tip...so when I paid my bill and didn't leave a tip on the machine she asked me if there was a problem with the food or the service,  I responded no...she rolled her eyes and I pointed out to her that the tip was cash in the table....she rolled her eyes again and walked away....my husband wanted to take the money back but I left it there...I then tried to wave her down to get the manager and let make them aware of my horrible treatment. ..but she wouldn't come back...I waited by the hostess table, no one showed. ..should be 0 star rating"}
{"text":"1 out of 5! I do not recommend this place! Only positive is its usually empty so you can always drop in for a quick beer with friends!"}
{"text":"Visited here for my husband's birthday on a regular summer Friday night. We waited a while to be recognized in the dining area. Pitcher \"jug\" are pretty flat. Food feels like it may have been frozen for a couple of months prior to being served. Service is nonchalant and slow. Go to real sports for a couple bucks extra. Cheers"}
{"text":"I felt compelled to leave my first Yelp review!

Came here after Jays game with friends because website said Thursday night was 1/2 price wings.  After ordering and receiving 4 pints was told wings were not half price because it was an event night.  You are right next door to Rogers centre.  When is Thursday night not an event night?  The website does not say event night exclusion.  Server only kept repeating \"I only work here\".  No apology or agreeing it was BS.  Just a robot reply.  Ended up going to real sports bar... at least you know what you're getting... good food but pricey!  I'll take that over scamming me everyday!!"}
{"text":"This review is directed at the Hoops Sports Bar and Grill location that is
situated on 4207 Keele Street (opposite of the York University Keele Street
Campus):

 On January 5th 2012, I was at this location with a research colleague
of mine at approximately 8:45pm. Being Graduate Students on a full
scholarships, we were at this establishment to celebrate new job prospects, an
imminent graduation, and possible entrance into law school and a PhD program,
respectively. Myself and my colleague are not the belligerent typology of bar
frequenting clientele- on the contrary, we are highly respectful individuals,
well educated, and we tend to tip fairly well in relation to the service and
treatment gained through each experience associated with a casual night out.

Now that the context has been laid, I will jump right into the disastrous event
that unfolded. Upon entering the establishment, we ordered 1 (one) pitcher of
Heineken, 1lb of peppercorn wings + fries, and another 1lb of honey garlic
wings+ fries. We received our pitcher of Heineken just fine, and by 9:00pm our
first order of 1lb peppercorn wings + fries arrived, yet, the second order was
nowhere to be seen. My colleague and I started to eat the first order of wings
and fries while anticipating the second order to arrive momentarily. 

Sadly, after 20minutes of waiting (approx. 9:20pm) we approached the nearest server and politely informed her that we were still awaiting the second order, the one that consisted of 1lb of honey garlic wings + fries. Within 15minutes, the
outstanding order arrived and my colleague and I proceeded to enjoy our food.

Upon consuming the one pitcher of beer and devouring the 2lbs of wings and
fries, we were approached by a server in regards to the bill, and we mutually
relayed the notion of splitting the bill- the price of the pitcher would be
covered by my colleague, and I would pay for the 2lbs of wings + fries.

 When the final bill arrived, it stated that we had received: 1 order of 2lbs of
wings + fries (approx: $20.29) and one order of: 1lb wings + fries (approx:
$10.13), and the total was in the vicinity of $30 and change. Upon noticing
this error that likely stemmed from a miscommunication, I politely informed the
server that the bill was incorrect. Within the span of 5minutes, my colleague
and I were surrounded by three very confrontational and hostile servers who
began to spew accusations and engage in a highly condescending and abusive tone of voice. 

The servers claimed that the first order of wings (2lbs) were in a
'very large circular tray' and the second (1lb) order was in a smaller oval
tray. My colleague and I disagreed by stating that both orders arrived in the
smaller oval shaped tray (ie. the 1lb trays) and that there was no presence of
a 'very large circular tray'. Furthermore, we mentioned that each order
received had approx 6-8 wings as opposed to the 10-12 wings that accompany a
2lb order.... 

Eventually one of the servers who had 'attitude' yelled, \"Im very
busy and I dont have time to argue over $6, next time, when you eat 3lbs of
wings you should pay for your 3lbs of wings\". My rebuttal was: \"Next time, you
should take note of what a customer orders, and that order should be reflected
on the bill\". ....She obviously did not take kindly to those words, and
eventually an adjusted bill of $16.90 was brought out. I paid using my Amex
Gold card, left a $0.00 tip and proceeded to exit the establishment. 

Prior to reaching the exit, the server with attitude who was stationed at the bar yelled \"thanks a lot guys, good job you f****** cheap as*es\". The last words uttered by this server were not taken kindly by myself and my colleague and for some reason or another, we perceived the foundation of our treatment laden with racial undertones (myself being an East Indian Male (brown skinned), and my colleague- a visibly Jewish Male (Star of David pendant exposed) - both somehow playing the inadvertent and stereotypical cliche roles of the \"Cheap Brown Guy/Cheap Jewish Guy\". I would strongly encourage every potential customer to read not only this review but the others that accompany those in relation to the Hoops establishment located at 4207 Keele Street- they are all negative. 

I still have the receipt and bill saved to verify the date/time my colleague and I were present, and I am more than willing to sit down with the manager and owner of this sub-par restaurant."}
{"text":"Early afternoon on a weekday, and the restaurant was about 1/2 or 2/3 full, with lots of staff around. 10 minutes after our group of five was seated, server #1 took our drink order. That was the last we saw of her. Ten or fifteen minutes later we flagged down server #2 at the next table and asked her to find server #1, explaining we only had one more hour before we had to be back at our meeting. Server #2 came back eventually and brought some but not all of our drink order, promising the others would be out soon and also taking our food orders. The other drinks finally arrived maybe 10-15 and the food 25 more minutes later, 45 or 50 minutes after we had arrived, though my order was incorrect. Server #2, be it said, seemed to be trying hard - for example cheerfully taking my order back and fixing it, quite quickly for once. My sense was that there was something going odd back in the kitchen.

The topper was that one guy asked for a glass of water, and when it finally showed up it was clearly tap water with ice dropped in it just before serving, rather than being pre-chilled. It actually arrived at the table rather warm. Never seen that before in a restaurant, no matter how low-quality!

The sandwiches and fries were okay. One guy got soup and expressed the opinion it was watered-down store-bought out of a can. Prices weren't bad. But unless you are not hungry or thirsty and have lots of time to blow, I wouldn't recommend the place."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for an after work drink and some ribs. First impression when I walk in is the place is dirty. Patio is niceand modern but somebody should be cleaning the tables better.
I had the Rib and Wing combo which was ok. I cannot complain but I cannot tell you that I was impressed either. It was supposed to be the special of the day but it just looked like they cut the price and the portion size. Fries were good though!
The key is at this restaurant is the service, or should i say the lack of service. Both bartender and waitress never smile, are not very attentive and do not seem to care about being there. This is probably a result of the management/ownership lack of attentiveness. I saw the owner and he looked more like an overseer then someone who was pushing his team to succeed. 
Stay away, until the ownership understands what it means to be in the hospitality business."}
{"text":"what should i mention first ?!
- poor service
- cold food
- small portion
why did I come here again?"}
{"text":"Service was decent. Lots of extra charges.. Even when we tried to return luke warm food. We were told the wings were great. They were mediocre... Wouldn't come back. Even the music was the a buzz kill. Not a good alternative to Real Sports Bar... We can see why it was empty."}
{"text":"Ordered the burger and fries. Bland and stale bread that fell apart on me. Draft beer is a bit flat (Keith's). Old, gross looking menus. The place is falling apart.  Oh, and no debit option. Credit card or cash only. There is, however, an atm on site. Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"The poutine was good but that's about all I can say good about this place. It smelled gross and the hostess was less than friendly. We should have left the minute we walked in."}
{"text":"Bad service, asks half the table what they want to drink and since half the people asked for water she just said ill get you water and left without asking the rest if they wanted a drink.  Brought out triple the amount of cutlery as needed that took up space.  I ordered the spicy BBQ chicken wrap.  The chicken on the wrap was cold and the BBQ sauce was so spicy I couldn't get through it.  (I've eaten scorpion and ghost peppers I can handle heat)  Wouldn't go there again.  Did I mention I almost fell through my chair as the chair cushion had detached from the chair and was half off the chair.  Fun times."}
{"text":"Worst part of my trip to Toronto!  Our party of 4 was seated promptly then waited 20 minutes for a waitress to take our drink orders.  Other groups seated after us were eating appetizers by the time our first round of drinks arrived.  

After taking our entree orders the waitress disappears...the guy who greeted and seated us (manager/host?) brings our food to the table.  My fish & chips dinner looked like it came from a fast food seafood chain restaurant.  Two pathetically small pieces of fish were overshadowed by a copious, but unremarkable and soggy pile of french fries.  

My daughter's meatballs and pasta with tomato sauce entree arrived quite dry and in desperate need of some additional sauce.  She asks for some \"additional sauce\". The manager(?) asks if she wants ketchup, hot sauce, or salsa.  At first everyone at the table thought he was joking.  I said \"she wants more red sauce...spaghetti sauce for the pasta\".  He asks again if she wants ketchup.  I looked at him like he had just fallen from outer space.  I told him \"pasta sauce...tomato sauce\".  He comes back to the table with salsa and ranch dressing and says \"mix them together and try it...it's good\".  Again, we thought he was joking, but nope, he was just clueless.  

Our original waitress doesn't return at all to check on our meals or to ask if we wanted drink refills...where the hell did she go?  We all finally get water refills from another waitress and finish eating our average to substandard entrees.  Our meals clearly finished, with empty dishes and empty drink glasses piling up (3 per person), no one clears a thing until we asked for waitress number 3 to do so- she removes a few items from the table.  Waitress number three must have taken over for number 1 on a shift change.  Maybe its her first day on the job.  After about ten more minutes she pops by the table and clears a few more dishes.  She clearly had no perception that we were all finished with dinner and had been waiting for the check.  My wife prods me not to ask for the check just to see if the waitress would actually take the initiative to provide us some aspect of quality service.  The waitress doesn't ask if we are finished or if we wanted anything else so I ask her, \"can I have our check please\"....she looks at me with a puzzled countenance and says \"you want the bill?\"  Waitress number three comes back to the table and has no idea how to use the wireless credit card machine.  She looks at me and asks if my card is a debit card.  I said no...it clearly reads VISA on the face of the card.  I think that VISA is universally understood to be a credit card in most urban restaurants.  The one star is for two average meals of the 4 entrees we ordered.  If I could give a minus 1 for service, that would be too generous,"}
{"text":"This is a great example of a time when Yelp should allow 0 stars. I don't normally like to put negative energy out but I feel like I can save a lot of people disappointment by suggesting avoidance if you want to enjoy your food. We had a really great server who was only doing their job, but otherwise our experience was not one I would like to recommend to others. Their \"that will be extra charge\" bit gets old really fast. Go to real sports or jack Astros and eat edible food and remember this yelp forever"}
{"text":"Let me just say this. It's a sport bar, so your going to get pub food and drinks, but in saying that I have never had a great meal at this place and it's not cheap. The pool tables in the back are also tiny and are hard to play when there's more than 2 people. 

The service has historically been spotty but has been okay recently. 


Only reason I return is due to its proximaty to my condo and ease for a drink after a game and the pool tables, however I would check our Real Sports, St. Louis , Jack Astors, or loose moose. 

Food- 1/5
Service - 2/5
Location - 5/5
Pool tables +1
TV quality -1"}
{"text":"Excellent place on Tues and Thurs for the best deal on wings and beers!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review so the rest of you do not WASTE a single cent on this place.

Long story short, (my honest opinion) seems like they are struggling for business, place was empty - considering there are tons of other options nearby and for that reason they seem to be cutting corners with food. They seriously water down everything, the sauces, dips etc.. I guess they have to make inventory stretch but no! it's unacceptable for the prices they are charging.
I stopped here thinking how could you screw up fries, burgers and snacks you know? Boy I was wrong. My friends order the burgers which had a cold middle and my $10 poutine was a joke. It was almost rude to charge $10 for it, I would've been happier giving McDonalds my $10 for a small fries and give the cashier the change. And avoid the spinach dip, they basically take it out of a jar, grate some cheese ontop and bam, there is your $15 dip and if you don't eat it fast enough youll see the water start to build ontop. gross lol. You would think considering it was empty you'd get better service? No, she barely checked on us! 

Keep walking just a little bit more and you'll reach REAL Sports bar.. 
Much more worth it.

STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"I would give it no stars...
It's my first time here... this place is gross. The fries were soggy and the chicken fingers were undercooked. Our waitress forgot our drinks and it took her 20 minutes to bring a pitcher of beer. The only reason why i came here were because the other sports bars were packed and the raptor's game was about to start. I'd rather miss the game than come here. Argh

Update: just found a fly in my beer....."}
{"text":"The service here was absolutely horrible. The food took forever to come and the main dish came with the appetizer. The food was dry and horrible. Overpriced. Next time will head over to real sports."}
{"text":"Hoops is a chained restaurant? How?

Let me get this in the open right now; if you are a civilized person, do not come here. 
If you're looking for a place to subside your hunger, do not come here.
If lack the physical ability to defend yourself, do not come here.
And if you are a York University student looking for some late night grub, don't have a car and this was the only place open, still..do not come here!

I have been here on several occasions, none of which were voluntary, and all of them during the late hours. I like to call it: 'The Hoops of York'
You will never have trouble finding parking here as the enormous lot caters exclusively to its patrons at night with every other store closed. This run-on sentence concludes everything good I have to say about Hoops.

Upon entrance, you are met by baseball caps, size XXL collared shirts on medium sized people, medium Tapout shirts on XXL people, students who should be studying at the Library at York instead, and clusters of Abercrombie & Fitch catalogue rejects. You will see beings of all stereotypes, and if you're lucky you might even see the waitress who is supposed to seat you. 
There are plenty of flat screens to keep you distracted while you endure the unbearable wait for your food. They go out of their way in promoting the wings here, and if you order anything else, I suggest you bring a Rubik's cube to keep you company.  The portion of the wings & fries are generous, but once you sink your teeth in, it quickly becomes obvious that these wings have been frozen..and probably for a long time. Seriously, what on Earth do they expect you to do with all that fries?! 
Don't come here with more than a group of four. But if you are, I hope for your sake there's a game on, and you're planning to watch it til the end. 

On certain days of the week, you'll get some army guys from the armoury nearby after 10:30 at night. Whether you support the troops or not, for goodness sake do not go near them. They will start a fight with you, as they believe they own the place. But that just about goes for every click who frequent here. There is an air of tension between each table. Someone once threatened me saying that his uncle was \"up there\" with the Hell's Angels. So naturally I told him that my uncle was \"up there\" with Toronto Police, and it would be lovely if our uncles were ever to meet. 
It gets pretty busy at night with students who don't know how to cook, and are too good for instant noodles. They even have a DJ booth at the elevated section spinning everything I hate. 
The restaurant is horribly under staffed, and it appears that the bartender seconds as the manager at front of house. Its miraculous that anyone here gets their order at this place. 

Honestly, my Yorkie friends. Forget about taking your hot classmate here to try to inebriate her. Just do her homework instead. It's faster."}
{"text":"The only good thing this sports bar has going for it is the location. If you ever get your beer order(which she forgot about my 2nd) it will be stale(like my guests) if you are able to put your empty beer glass on the edge of the table and she walks past it 8 times before asking if you want another one(which never came) then in my books you are not a very good server."}
{"text":"This is a great sports bar, with a lot of action.  There are plenty of TVs - and several booths with their own TVs. However, the service is a bit slow.  We came here to watch a basketball game and almost all of the TVs were tuned to hockey (even though the Leafs weren't playing). We had to beg our waitress to change just one of the 50+ TVs to basketball.  If they're not going to have basketball on, they should change the name to \"Pucks.\"  The food is OK. The chicken wings were good, pizza was so-so. Beer selection is large, but mostly bland mass-produced brands."}
{"text":"I was renting an AirBNB above this bar. I ended up there every day for wings, beers and sport.

Sexy waitresses and lots of entertainment"}
{"text":"Came here on a chilly overcast Saturday in December before a Marlies game.  We didn't want to pay the higher prices or wait in line at Real Sports, so this seemed a good second choice.  The place was probably 3/4 full around 1pm, with everyone there seeming to also be pre-hockey goers.  Service was a bit slow, but friendly.  Took the server a few times to get our bill right at the end.  There was myself and my boyfriend, and another couple with us, but she mixed up whom was with whom.  Then the second time, some items were wrong.  She got it right the third time and apologized, so it wasn't a big deal, but would be annoying if you were in a rush.  The food itself was so-so.  My 'event' pizza with mushroom, peppers and cheese was thin crust but had minimal topping or flavor.  My partner found his wings average and a bit dry.  The nachos my friend ordered were fine to her, but I found dry and overdone.  The atmosphere is fine with many TVs (including ones at your own booth, which is nice, and some TVs actually built into the floor, which is cool and I'd never seen before).  Large bar area and mid-sized place with maybe a capacity for a few dozen?  The bathrooms unfortunately are what bring down my score from a 3 to a 2.  In the ladies room, out of the four stalls, only two had locking doors.  Out of the two left, only one had toilet paper.  So that needs to be dealt with.  I'd go back here for drinks only if someone else recommended, but not on my own."}
{"text":"A friend suggested to go here as we had an event at delta afterwards (right across the street). I agreed, before I saw that this place had pretty bad reviews on here. We still ended up going, and it was exactly as the reviews said. Service, although friendly, was kinda slow. Our server also didn't really know the menu well when we asked her for beer/food suggestions. She mentioned she was new, so that's fine. It's the food that was extremely disappointing. We had a hoops pizza, and I think it was literally the most bland pizza I've ever eaten. I thought it was hard to screw up pizza, but it really wasn't good at all. I wouldn't really want to come back here to be honest."}
{"text":"I am going to echo some of the other reviews of this place by saying DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE. 

what kind of sports bar has ELLEN on not just one but many TVs??? Oh and they sat us in a booth with a tv that didn't work. In fact many of the booths had non functioning televisions. 

Server had no idea what a domestic beer is. 

Where do I start. Hmmm how can you screw up pub food? Nachos is pretty easy, no? Well... they couldn't make nachos. If they couldn't do that what else are they incompetent with?  The nachos came out not as I ordered. So when I requested they rectify it they brought out the same nachos with cold toppings on it. Manager insists that's how they do it? Nachos and cheese go in the oven and then everything else goes on top. Ok some may agree that's how it's done but when the server tells you 'careful the plate is hot' and it isn't hot, and the cheese is partially melted, the skepticism begins to brew. 

My Chili for the nachos was served on the side. So it's nachos with a chili dip. After 2 minutes on the table everything is not even warm but cold. I could put my finger in the middle of my side of chili and not even flinch. There was no point in ordering something else on the menu when many other options are within a stones throw. 

My wife ordered the pulled pork nachos and that was also cold with partially melted cheese. 

I'm sure this is a great place to meet for beer before a game but do yourself a favour, eat somewhere else. 
The manager was willing to remove the food from the bill. That was the only positive thing from our experience."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. The portions are great. 
Love coming here before a leafs or raptors game and grabbing a quit bite and a few drinks with friends before heading in to the ACC."}
{"text":"The place is hidden and it was dead when we went. 
We went on wing night. Tuesdays and Thursdays, pound for $5.99. Some beers are 3.75$ I think and after 9 $2.50 or something. 

The service was fast, considering we were the only ppl dinning. The server did say it's packed after 9 and we went at 4 lol. 
The servers were pleasant and helpful. 

The wings were huge and a steal for 5.99$
They charge you .99 cents for extra saucy and I can only enjoy wings if they are extra saucy. However, she didn't charge us . 

Your blah corner pub. I would come here again for their wing nights. 

We actually enjoyed the place being dead, we were able to converse without yelling at each other on wing night at a pub."}
{"text":"Extremely slow and inattentive service. Sat down at a table and waited for over five minutes and was never greeted by anyone but had about 6 different servers walk by us. Moved to the bar and waited another five minutes to be acknowledged by bartender who was busy chatting. Service could be improved."}
{"text":"Toronto's worst sports bar! Place is a dump, really dark, food is crap. Nothing good going on here. It's only busy when the overflow of other bars are forced to go there."}
{"text":"Disgusting bathrooms. Pretty much an average sports bar. We had wings, waffle fries & garlic bread. We chose this place because it was close to our hotel and we had a discount. Average prices for the city. Music in bar ran by a digital juke box. We took it over with what we liked. Other patrons weren't happy about it. Lol oh well. 3 drinks each and the food came to $100 before discount."}
{"text":"Slow service! Terrible waitresses I ordered a 'buffalo chicken sandwich' and I got the sloppiest sandwich I have ever seen ! Two skinny chicken fingers on a bun?! Ew I told her I wanted to order something else and the waitress said sorry it's going to take alongn time so I didn't eat any of it and she still billed me for it. Obviously was not goin g to i think McDonald's would have been a better option. Save your money it's overpriced and gross!"}
{"text":"Food:

Fairly standard American fair.  Wings, Burgers, Nachos, etc
Compared to other variants of this restaurant style the food isn't anything to rave about.  It's standard.

Service:

I've never been here really after work or on weekends when things probably get busy, but the service isn't great.  I've never been here when I haven't had to wait for a server to show up or missed an order or something off.  Must be the day shift, though I haven't been there in a while.

Atmosphere:

Lots of TVs so that's good for a sports bar.  Visibility to the different TVs is good too.  Booths and seating is good, they definitely maximize the space, though it makes the place look even emptier in the mornings with all the empty chairs, like in a western movie when you, the new law man in town, walk into the saloon, letting the creaking door close behind you as you survey the bar.  There to the left is the barkeep cleaning that glass with his rag, and as your eyes veer right, you settle on the lone figure sitting at the back of the bar, amid the sea of empty chairs, nursing his bud light, staring right back at you....--gasp...sorry got carried away...don't read that out loud, its too long :)"}
{"text":"Im pretty satisfied with this place! Went here with a group of 14 people on a last minute decision for a late birthday dinner/drinks and service was decent. Place was somewhat empty and the food came out a tad slow and they forgot the bacon and croutons in my Caesar salad so they brought it out on the side for me and i had to personally mix them in myself. Other than that, environment is decently relaxing with an upbeat music playing in the background. Food tasted good, servers were friendly and came often enough to check up on our group as well as refill water. Lastly, washrooms were dim and small but clean."}
{"text":"This place got everything wrong. First we tried sitting inside but it was 30+ degrees and the music was ear piercing loud. We then moved outside where we were kept waiting for a very long time before we could order drinks. The experience continually got worse - very bad food, got my order incorrect as well. Overall displeased. The only reason this place stays in business is their location."}
{"text":"As the saying goes: \"First impressions last a lifetime\".

My first impression of this place was terrible. B!tchiest waitress I've ever had in my life. SHE THREW THE MENUS AT US! 

Drank our water and left before even ordering. I will not go back to this place. Ever."}
{"text":"Would have to agree with a few other posts.  Average sports bar.  Good bar food.  We initially walked by and saw what others had and thought we'd give it a try.  Nothing really special but not terrible.  They initially forgot to put bacon on my burger and forgot our salad dressings.  Not a lot of drink refills.  Server was sweet.  Servers didn't seem all that intelligent but quite chesty if you get my drift.  Lots of people going to the Jays game. Overall not bad.  Again, sports bar atmosphere.  Small bathrooms."}
{"text":"About an average of a bar as you can get.

I never understood why it's called hoops though - they don't seem to be predisposed to play basketball games.

Anyways, everything about this place scream average.

I could rip on the layout - the chairs and tables are too close together, the decor - it's plenty dark, but food and beer is what you go to a pub/bar for. 

The food is standard fare, salads, burgers, ribs, chicken wings - nothing to write home about, but it's not bad either.

The beer is priced average - something like $16 a pitcher for domestic."}
{"text":"The layout of the bar makes it unpractical for large groups."}
{"text":"Horrible place.. Do not go.... Service sucked and the food was worse. When I walked in I asked the hostess if they got the NFL games... I was told yes and my wife and i seated at a booth with its own tv... Ordered drinks and waiter said he could change the TV.... Ordered dinner and got ready to watch the Raiders v broncos...Oh yeah we don't get NFL package. The salmon was gross. Dried and fishy... Wife's salad not much better... Manager didn't give a shit... Maybe he should do something other then walking around....When I left I told the hostess that when someone asks if you get the NFL package and you say yes and you don't that's what I call in the USA lying....Don't go here.... Go around the corner.....I wish I could have given it no starts"}
{"text":"This place is horrible had to wait 45 minutes for our food and when it finally came it was disgusting and hardly warm. The waitress seemed confused and the pop tasted like water. We were ignored most of our visit. It was my first and last time coming here."}
{"text":"What a Shit Hole!!!

Service is subpar, how does a restaurant run out of food and offer no substitution or accommodate requests???

Steer clear of this dive!!!

I will never come back here again were a table of 6 and 3 of our orders are screwed up and/or the kitchen refuses to accommodate requests and allergies."}
{"text":"Food is decent and nice servers, but the place is rather tired.  Went because I thought it would be a lively place to watch the Leafs.  Lots of TV's but many are broken or so old that the colour is really off.  Shockingly, for a Maple Leaf playoff game, many TV's were not even tuned to the game!  Had to ask servers to put it on.  What the...??  They have daily specials, but they are all cancelled when there is a game, which is funny for a sports bar because isn't that kind of the point?  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I came here with some coworkers after a company outing at Ripley's and I ate the following:

-Calamari - meh. It felt under-seasoned and fried a bit too much.  
-Coco shrimp - good taste and sauce, but there was too much batter for my liking.
-Fajita Friday special - great toppings, the veggies tasted great, but the meat wasn't very high quality and average at best.   However  they got my order mixed up with another person who ordered the same thing.  I prefer my steak medium rare and this was well done.  I'm not a fan of well done steak.  Overall though, it was not bad. 

-Service was pretty decent.  They gave us a nice big slice of chocolate cake since it was a co-worker's birthday. I didn't have any but everyone said it was delicious.

3 stars and it's just a normal sports bar."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar....  It's OK. The service is lacking sometimes. Even when they're not busy. Always seem to be waiting longer for food than you should if you look around at an almost empty restaurant and bar.  The food was decent...  Nothing special. The desert however was great. They were out of the caramel apple cheesecake....  But eh. What can you do. Service needs work....  And the overall attentiveness by waitstaff needs a kick in the ass. I'd give a 2.5. But I cant. So 2 it is."}
{"text":"Disgusting. After being disappointed with comicon, i came here with my boyfriend. Ordered a pitcher of Heineken which was flat. We ordered a burger meal with fries. The burger tasted horrible and the bun was falling apart. The fries were a total waste. Not worth the price at all. I would never visit here again, much less recommend it. I wish i read the reviews prior to coming here."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good restaurant I got the pull pork wrap with sweet potato fries. The food I got was great fries was excellent but the person I was eating with order a medium rare steak but they made it medium well. After words they replaced the steak I appreciated that. A Small compliant but still a negative. The environment is nice with an abundance of different games and sporting events.All in all good deals for the meal and would definitely come again if in the area"}
{"text":"ugh this place

everytime I come here for non drink related things, I always regret it, but drinks wise, its great!

here's the skinny on this joint (my slang is so hip right?)

It's the closest pub to York U, so it's clientèle is mostly students, with occasional riff raff  that drifts here from Jane and Finch..


The drinks are cheap, the games are always a playin' and they have some food specials sometimes.

But don''t go here to eat, you're better off getting food at York Lanes bro.


Walk here from Campus, its just a stone throw away.

So um, yea. Hoops.

It's definitely something."}
{"text":"Not sure why these guys got such bad reviews, it almost prevented me from coming here but I was desperate to find a good sports bar that I decided to take a chance.
I'm glad I did because this is by far the best sports bar in the area and the only one that you can watch a game on a big giant screen with the volume on.
I had the burger and it was great.
So all in all I think his place is worth your time if all you want is to enjoy a good game, a beer and a burger."}
{"text":"Fun place to go in the neighbourhood. Atmosphere are older men watching sports, not the best for a younger crowd, but not terrible. Food is getting A LOT better. Burgers made with local ingredients."}
{"text":"My review in August stated a poor experience in quality, wait time and service. Thanks for the comments Dave but I find it ironic that my review was about quality and waiting and it took 3 months for you to respond, and you're response was as bland and generic as the food. I will return to Toronto but not Hoops. Sorry"}
{"text":"For chains such as these I've come to believe it's best to stay with tried and true classics such as burgers and fried foods (I mean, there's much less to mess up here...). 

Pasta? ...please. Just pour yourself a pitcher of vegetable oil and down that instead. 

At least their Double Chocolate Mousse CheeseCake was pretty good. Decorative as well (to my surprise)!"}
{"text":"Honestly not a whole to write about Hoops Sports Bar & Grill. The food is pretty standard American/Canadian staples like burgers and sandwiches. I had a pulled pork wrap which was lacking in BBQ sauce. The fries were pretty good at least. The prices are a few dollars higher than other similar restaurants probably because of the location near the Rogers centre / ACC. Overall it is pretty much what you would except."}
{"text":"If you happen to be coming from where I was and walking towards the Rogers Centre by way of Bremner and want a beer and a bite, you're a bit stuck. Hoops is one of only a couple of options. 

The service was mildly attentive, the interior obnoxious to even a big sports fan like myself (how many TVs do you need? One at the table? Ugh) and the food way, WAY overpriced. A pedestrian ravioli dish for $17.99? Yikes...I'm a lousy chef and I could have replicated it pretty easily. And what's worse, it doesn't seem as though they even feature their full menu before games. They have something called an \"event menu\" where my first and second choices (I looked online beforehand) weren't available! So for at least 163 nights of the year (Jays, Leafs and Raptors games) you're stuck with this limited menu? And I'm not even counting concerts, lacrosse and whatever else might constitute an \"event\". Now I may be wrong and perhaps this only pertains to baseball games, though I somehow doubt it. In any event, it's still pretty weak.

If you can, go out of your way if necessary and take Front Street. You'll have about a hundred options, most of them being much better. So unless you're coming from work, have little time and Bremner is unavoidable, skip this place and hit up Jack Astor's or The Loose Moose or Overdraught or well, anyplace else. When I was there and the other few times I walked by it was pretty packed and there's no reason for that, other than the location. Avoid."}
{"text":"I can only review service and quality of \"cocktail\" I ordered.  I wish I could give 1/2 a star.  My hubs needed to use the washroom, so I thought we might order a drink to use the facilities here - color me completely stoopid :/
We flagged down the bartender, from chatting up her fellow employees, as she had her back to the bar patrons.  When I got her somewhat divided attention, she was perplexed by my order -- margarita on the rocks with salt.  I had pull like taffy from her, which tequilas she had to offer.  Once I got the list of two (I can't make this up), she wanted to know if my \"on the rocks\" margarita was frozen.  I thought explaining \"rocks\" just meant over ice cubes, it would help.  It didn't.  I finally got a tall glass full of margarita mix only for $19.  Add $3 for my club soda.  I couldn't even drink it, as you would imagine syrup over ice would go down.  Another 10 minutes to grab her from wandering aimlessly staring at her feet or hands and we paid the $22 for leaving a full drink on the bar and a 30 second visit to the washroom.  This place was our only hiccup in the city thank God and duly noted."}
{"text":"The only reason why we came here was due to Real Sports Bar being packed.  However HOOPS is your usual pub with all the pub fares, etc so dont expect too much.  
The service was sub-par as our server had no idea what beers where on-tap or bottled, which should be general knowledge if you're working at a bar.  In addition, even before the venue started getting crowded, getting drinks served took longer than most pubs tha I've been to in the past. 
The food selection and prices are reasonable at HOOPS.  For fares we ordered their HOOPS nachos with spicy chicken, along with their sweep potato fries and a pint of their belgian beer they had on tap.  Overall the food was good.....just good."}
{"text":"Well, unfortunately I have to decrease my original rating BIG TIME for this place. Went in for a beer around 5 o'clock yesterday while I was waiting for a Dominos pizza. I wish I hadn't. Atmosphere was completely shot...just an overall dull on-your-deathbed kind of feeling in the air...

Bartender greeted me first before the waitress/hostess (i don't know if the waitress was shy but the whole time she was usually somewhere in the back). Didn't really like the snooty/lazy service already...'bartendress' behaving as if I'm some sort of dumb-a$$ for not knowing all the brands of domestic beer...maybe i am but I wouldn't expect a tip if you feel so inclined to talk down to me! I still went ahead and ordered a Budweiser. Bartender told me to sit down and the waitress would bring me a bottle. Decided to sit out on the patio to grab some sun and the waitress was smiley & friendly & served me my bottle...she was also kind enough to let me know that the bar rail was the same price as the domestic beer. Then I remembered the Leafs were playing against Colorado so I went inside to watch.

By this time, I noticed that not only was the first table I sat on dirty but so is the indoor mini-table by the bar & pretty much the whole floor, in general. On top of that, the bathroom was absolutely filthy too!  If the waitress is so bored why doesn't she make herself useful by sweeping or cleaning up a bit?! The hand dryer in the bathroom was also broken with a big sign 'out of order, sorry!' & the crappiest soap I've ever witnessed in a bathroom. The soap contraption shoots out a tiny speck of foam - just useless. I Sincerely hope this is not the same soap that the staff are using because ain't NAY-TING getting clean with that subpar soap. 

The Leafs were sucking as per usual and I needed one more drink to quiet the sorrow inside my 416-soul. I ordered a double amaretto sour (why do i even bother at these low-brow joints...) and the bartender agreed to add real lime instead of bar lime. I paid a pretty dime for this drink and got back half a cup of a drink. Pointed it out - she didn't care. By the time Colorado scored their 2nd goal I had to get out of there and got up and asked the bartender for the bill (waitress is never there...I suspect animosity between the two staff members). 

I paid, left, grabbed my brooklyn style pepperoni pizza from Dominoes (yay!) and walked by the bar again and what DO I HEAR? LOL The bartender is cussing me out! Here she is with the waitress (oh look they're friends again!) talking about how I yelled at her because the Leafs were losing lol. I wanted to go in and reassure her that me asking for the bill, in no way, shape or form, means that I was angry at her. But talking trash about your customers in front of other customers? That's a no-no. 

I will NEVER be back. I suggest teaching your staff about proper etiquette & professional dress because the excess make-up is very unappealing - jus' sayin. A lil less rouge & pasty globbed-on lipstick would probably be a bit more professional (I am not exaggerating). 

There. NOW you have something to talk crap about me to your fellow staffers."}
{"text":"My First yelp review as a \"Toronto\" Yelper!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

and sigh... I'm giving it 1 star- what a rough start. Not to mention that I moved back to Toronto from Vancouver to watch a Game 6 Stanley cup playoff game too. What was I thinking not to book my flight one week later?

Anyways - back to my experience at Hoops.

From the moment I sat down, I felt like the waitress was hounding me for my order. I felt rushed and uncomfortable. There were crumbs in my water, which is never a good sign.

Their bar rail (house hardballs were $4 after 7) options didn't include caesars, but I was not informed of that information. In addition to that - their menu needs to be up to date. Being particularly picky yesterday, I wanted the Amsterdam Blonde in a bottle - she brings me back a huge glass, which once again, I was not told it was not in bottles, and if I had known, I would've gotten something else.... I was in a bad enough mood already.

The quarter chicken dinner I ordered was... OK. The meat was decent and not dry. The gravy seemed like it had come out from a package, and the \"seasonal\" vegetables were from frozen, especially the carrots which were definitely frozen burn.
The fries were skinny and deep fried to the max - no potato to it whatsoever... just thinking about it makes me grossed out. Even McDonalds had more potato than their fries. They could've been sitting there for hours, even overnight and then tossed onto my plate.

The pizza was okay as well.. the crust had good bite, but I wasn't expecting anything great.

The prices compared to other places in town are definitely pricier, and you can definitely get cheaper elsewhere for MUCH better food.
The TVs are great for game watching, but i will not be back here.... EVER."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here on a Sunday to grab an appetizer and watch some football. It was really hot and muggy and the server said sitting by the ceiling fans help. We opted to sit at the bar and ordered coconut shrimp and calamari. The coconut shrimp were a little too crispy but the calamari was not bad."}
{"text":"The service wasn't the best, asked for Mild wings, and got BBQ wings, over priced, for no reason. You could definitely find a better spot. Don't end your fun night here. It will ruin it"}
{"text":"Blehhh this place is horrible. Bad service. made us wait 15 min to even get seated. No air condition inside. had to sit inside because it was so bad. server outside was running around - forgetting stuff all the time and did not even care about us. food was eh - forgot half of what we requested. Then she made us wait 30 min to give us our check...."}
{"text":"The food here was generously served. Portion size was huge! For me at least. And the food tasted alright. It wasn't bad, nor was it amazing. I think I ordered fish and chips? Or chicken fingers? Lol, I can't remember, but their menu had variety. 

Overall the service was great and they always have games going on. A great atmosphere to just hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Hoops tries to be a pub, it fails horribly. Their food is terrible, their service is terrible and their layout blocks more views than it helps. Their only saving grace is the big screen TV they have in the main room.

TL;DR: don't come here. Save your money for a quality place."}
{"text":"Service is hit and miss at this location.  More often than not, it has been good. 

Fajita special - mostly onions. not too much meat. otherwise good.

Ravioli - was supposed to have pesto sauce? sauce did not look recognizable, left co-worker hungry

wing special - sometimes over cooked, tasty fries, inconsistent spicing.

Would I go here on wing special days?
Of course.  You have to buy a drink, but for less than $10 i get a pound of wings, fries and a drink.

Are there too many TVs?
It's a sports bar you dumb ass! And there is no such thing as too many TVs and there doesn't exist a TV that is \"big enough\"

Is this my go to destination?
If I'm near the Rogers Centre and don't feel like going to far away then yes."}
{"text":"Location is this place's saving grace. It's still open because it's probably the only thing close to The ACC that isn't always jam packed (Real Sports) or super expensive.

Came here yesterday before the Leafs game as of course, Real Sports was full and The ACC didn't open their doors till 6:30pm. Forced to go here due to proximity.

Like what most other people said, there's no freaking AC at this joint. WTF guys! I was sweating my face off.. in mid October!

I ordered a pint of Keiths and it came with 1.5 inch of foam at the top.. and the pint glass itself was one where the entire glass filled to the top would be a pint. I didn't bother complaining because, to be truthful, I wanted to eat and get out. 

I ordered the Hat Trick burger. Overcooked, and bland. The fries were okay though."}
{"text":"It's great if you want to go to a sports bar by the acc. Don't expect your food and drinks very quickly though. Service is slow. Foods not great either. If you're hungry and your foods not ready yet there is plenty plastered on the walls, eat up."}
{"text":"I have been ordering take out from this location for years and the service and food quality have be on a strong decline. 

To avoid cooking dinner on a Friday night while friends were over, the following was ordered:

2 orders of Chicken Wings (honey garlic and medium):
-in the past we would get 8 wings per order but this time we only received 6
-when I pointed this out to the server upon pick up, she said \"oh, I don't know what to tell ya.\" 
-both orders were overcooked (I mean REALLY over cooked)

Hoops Deluxe Nachos
-the order was half the size from previous orders I have had (not exaggerating 50% smaller)
-again, when I mentioned this when I picked up the order, the server didn't seem to care. She did proceed to tell the other 3 servers sitting down behind the bar about it and they all just shrugged their shoulders and continued chatting

Onion Rings
-did not come with the dipping sauce listed on the menu
-i didn't notice this until I got home

Spinach Dip
-it is meant to come with pita chips for dipping...my order had 4. That's right, 4 small triangle pieces of pita for a full order of dip that is meant to be shared
-I had to ask the server twice before she agreed to give me more. However, instead of pita chips, she gave me nacho chips 

I think they anticipate that customers who place orders for pick up don't actually check their order before leaving the restaurant.

I am not one to complain and if the restaurant had been super busy (like on a game night or something), I would be a bit more understanding but that was not the case. There may have been 15 - 20 people in the restaurant and 4-6 servers appearing to be \"hanging out\" behind the bar.

It was clear that I was unhappy with the food and service and no one cared to take the opportunity to make the situation / experience better. 

My recommendation to other potential customers would be to spend the extra money and walk a block east and go to REAL SPORTS BAR instead It has MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH better food and service"}
{"text":"The service here exceeds the  Real Sports Bar 10 fold. If you want a sports bar near the ACC or Rogers centre this is the spot if want value and service."}
{"text":"I really can't understand how this place is in business in such a high rent zone. No AC on a hot night where they charge a $10 PP cover to watch UFC. $10 for an 18 oz. domestic beer after tax and tip. Service is horribly slow and as others have mentioned the bathrooms are disgusting. I give it a 2nd star because they had the UFC when most other bars did not. I'll look for another place to watch next time I am in Toronto during an event that I want to see. Very poor operators as the location has serious potential."}
{"text":"Called to make a reservation, arrived with my guests and there was no recollection of the table for 8 I had called in for. The manager (who I spoke to over the phone) denied ever speaking on the having this conversation (he had a very distinct accent that helped me pinpoint exactly who it was that I spoke to). He quickly tried to separate us and give us two booths apart from one another for groups of 4. He was very quick to leave it at that, with no apology or sense of sincerity. After making it obvious that I wasn't going to tolerate that, he quickly put together three dirty high tables with wobbly seats in a tiny corner. One of my guests went up to him to let him know that it was my birthday, and to request shots for the table. He went on to telling my guest that I was rude and racist for the comment that I had made about his accent. 

All in all, I understand that you're put under a lot of pressure, especially with a last minute table of 8. But if you are going to make a mistake, be honest about it and don't try to put the blame on others. He even asked me to show proof of the call because he said I probably called a different restaurant. 

He was very unprofessional, we got no apology, and decided to criticize me to one of my guests. The food was absolutely terrible and the tequila shots were all watered down. The service and quality here is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"I wanted to drink some beer and munch on some food before the game. I walked in here and straight to the bar. I ordered my beer and ordered the Hoops Poutine. The women behind the bar was very attentive and prompt. I didn't bother reading the reviews before I arrived here because it didn't really matter at this point. It was almost game time and I needed some beer and food before the game. 

I'm glad I didn't read the reviews because I didn't experience any of what most reviews even said. Nobody was rude, the Poutine was damn tasty. Maybe this isn't the best Poutine out there but it's the best I've ever had. People have to realize that it's a sports bar & grill, not a 5 star restaurant with exceptional service. It's a quick order your food and beer place unfortunately. This place doesn't not deserve a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Came back again against better judgment. Such a surprise that this place is still in business.

Was downtown in the area with coworkers, my manager, and a few others. We were all tired, hungry, and had a hankering for some drinks and basic pub food. My manager saw Hoops in the distance and recommended going. I told him about my past experience, however I did state that it could have just been the day or the waitresses on duty therefore it may be a completely different experience this time. Boy, was I right in the worse way.

When we arrived, we were told a table for five wouldn't be available for about twenty minutes as they needed to get one ready. No problem, it was midday on a weekend so it's understandable. We sat outside enjoying the sun for the time and went back in to be seated. The hostess told us that they have yet to clear any tables. Straight behind her were FIVE customer-less tables with the tables unclear. We asked if she could please get just one cleaned up so we can sit. We were told to give her 5-10 minutes. We went back outside and 15 minutes later went back in. Low and behold, none of the tables had been touched. She asked us to wait another 10 minutes. My manager ended up walking past her, picking up the dishes from one of the tables, placing them onto another with dishes on it, and asking her to wipe down the now clear table. We all sat down frustrated and exhausted.

We got water right away from the hostess, however it took twenty minutes for a waitress to come by to ask what we wanted to drink. By that point, we had our food orders chosen so we placed those also. Drinks arrived ten minutes later, every single one of them wrong and were taken back. Food arrived twenty minutes after that and were so unappetizing, most of us didn't make it half way through. We asked for the bill for our food only as we never received our rectified drinks. Fifteen minutes later, she shows up with our proper drinks and the bill. We state that since we have been done eating for some time and since we specifically asked her to have the drinks removed, we didn't want the drinks now and wouldn't be paying for them. She refused to remove them as we had them sitting in front of us. We ended all leaving cash for the total of our food and leaving.

Not to mention that none of the bathroom stalls had toilet paper during the entire duration of our visit, five waitresses were sitting in a booth together having drinks in between taking orders (I assure you that they were not on their breaks), the sheer rudeness of every worker we encountered, along with a myriad of other problems.

Mr David H. may visit Yelp frequently as he pretty much has to apologize on every single review. I don't need nor want an apology and plea to give them another chance; I want the business to learn how a proper restaurant should be run. If you need to close for a week to train your staff and make sure everything is how it should be, so be it. At least take some pride in your establishment. I will never be setting foot in here again and will stop anybody I know from coming near this place."}
{"text":"This place is okay. If there's a game on, don't expect to get a seat. The service is mediocre and the food is hit and miss. I usually get the Buffalo chicken wrap or sandwich and the burgers are pretty good. I live close, so it's convenient, but if you have the time to spare walk the extra few minutes to Front St or King St."}
{"text":"Being the tourist that I am, I ventured into Downtown Toronto my first weekend in the Great White North. And how did it welcome me... with FREEZING COLD weather. Nevertheless, I had to go to CN Tower, jump on the glass floor in the viewing area, have my new umbrella blown out, and then stumble into a bar. I was heading towards Air Canada Center when I saw Hoops & some shelter from the cold. 

We were seated pretty quickly in a booth that was honestly a little small and a lotta claustraphobic surrounded by HELLA TVS! 

Big ones.

Small ones.

Multi-screen ones.

Ones in your booth.

(Even ones in the bathroom!)

I guess when you're there to watch a game... you'll never have an excuse to miss a moment of it.

The food was your typical sports bar faire. Pasta & Burgers FTW! Full bar, too. The warm fuzzy feeling definitely made the rest of the walk to ACC a little more tolerable."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at Hoops. Ever. Why? No reason, although their basketball shaped menus are a tad silly, but I guess it IS called \"Hoops.\" 
But it was never the menu that bothered me - offering your typical pub fare, which I'm sure is decent enough - it's just that the first time I visited Hoops a few years back on an NFL Sunday I was there to drink and watch sports, and have been doing that there ever since. 
I have only sat at the bar as you have the best view of the TVs there, including one of those 9 screen GIANT TVs that can broadcast one large image or 9 multiples, or anywhere in between. 
Beer selection is decent, and they often have specials. I tend to order Steam Whistle when there, probably because the brewery is a 3 minute walk down the road and it MUST be fresh, right? 
The patio is long, with a great view of the CN Tower & Rogers Centre. Sat here one early summer afternoon with the missus and we hended up having more beers than we planned, which I check off as a compliment to the place.
For those Go Train commutersout there, Hoops is an easy walk to Union to make that last train of the night back to Durham Region, and you most definitely need some liquid assistance to make that long ride East.
So, I like Hoops over Real Sports or Loose Moose because it allows for the comfortable \"local pub\" feel and the prices are easily 20% cheaper than Real Sports just down the road.
I promise I will dine there next visit and update this review. And when I say \"dine\" I mean have some wings and fries at the wood. But still..."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible in every aspect. Food arrived both incredibly late and out of order with the rest of the party. Food was clearly sitting too long and all the lettuce in my wrap was cooked. Wait staff was mediocre at best and forgot to bring our orders which made the already late food even later. Would never go back."}
{"text":"Horrible crappy food. Crappy layout. Crappy tvs. Stay away. They have daily specials but don't honour them on game night. The location I'm mentioning is the one closest to the ACC. Seriously. It's awful. Everything about it"}
{"text":"Agree with VA.'s review entirely about service and TVs, but the place deserves more love than just 2 reviews, so I'm adding another!

Have been a few times since moving into the area.

First things first - the wings. I remember the wings being ok.  Nothing great.  I like dry and crispy, these were wet and a little too fatty/chewy... However, like I said, I agree with V.A.  You give me that wing deal and I will do it.

On my most recent visit (the same night as a Leafs' game) it was busy.  Fortunately, we got a table quickly.  Unfortunately, the place has crammed a lot of tables into the space and at our table of four, we were pretty darn close to our neighbors making it more like a table for six.

Now, to add something new to the mix...
The burger, I think it is called the \"Paris Burger\", was a great surprise!  I usually have low expectations for bar burgers because they tend to be either a frozen patty from McCains, or a charcoal hockey puck.  But I'm a guy who likes a good burger, so I'm going to try it at least once!  So, the Paris burger.  It was cooked well, not under or over.  The patty was substantial and may have been processed, but it didn't have much fat or gristle, which is common of those burgers.  It also had some dijon mustard and peppercorns spread on top that added a bit of that spice that goes so nicely with beef.  Add in my pint of Guiness and I was a very happy camper.

Any way, this is not an Irish pub, or a fancy beer bar; It's a sports bar.  A place you go to watch sports on an absurd number of televisions, drink beer, and usually devour the flesh of some dead animal.  And in all these categories it succeeds."}
{"text":"Ok....this is my 2nd review of this restaurant. I was here in 2014 & the owner \"Richard\" assured me they were upgrading the place. So I decided to go back.....NOT GOOD!
*The restaurant was dark & dingy
*The chairs that I tried were all wobbly. I looked for a non-wobbly chair but to no avail. Even the waitress couldn't find a non-wobbly chair!
*The table was sticky, like it was wiped down with a sugar water 
*The chicken in my chicken fajitas was clearly not fresh. It had the \"reheated taste\" too it
*The fixings that came with were bad. The lettuce was wilted, the cheese had that greasy look, meaning it had sat a room temp for a while & the overall quantity was insufficient to cover the fajitas shells 

All in all this was my 2nd bad experience at this restaurant. This place should just close down & reboot as a better restaurant. This is NOT a \"do over\", go to another restaurant there's better close by."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE.  We went to watch the Leafs game here and it was such an awful experience we won't be back.  Once seated at our table we were ignored until we flagged down someone to ask where are server was.  I expect to pay more for cider, but not $8.15.  On game nights there is an event menu with WAY higher prices, not cool.  The food was meh for such high prices.  And the bathrooms are unclean and not stocked.  One stall in the ladies washroom went from 6-10pm with no paper, even after I brought it to their attention.  And my husband was drinking a beer that was advertised as part of a contest.  When we asked the server for details she had no clue.  We had to ask several times before being given a ballot."}
{"text":"Overall the vibe of this place is pretty good. Numerous Tv's covering various sporting events. The only problem is that the service is not great. The sports bar was not particularly busy yet the waitress took forever from getting our drinks to serving us with the bill. Overall I would probably not come here again as the service was terrible (maybe do to overworked employees) however the vibe is good."}
{"text":"Had an awesome night with friends here, every staff member there was super friendly and service was prompt! Our server Angela was amazing and really made us feel welcome for our first time here! Definitely would recommend and we will be coming again!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night with a friend that I hadn't seen in a while, hoping to catch up with him.  There was a big hockey game on (IIHF junior gold medal game), so I was hoping to catch that too.  This is a sports bar, right?  I figured it was a safe bet that it would be showing.
We got to the bar, sat down, and ordered a couple of drinks.  The hockey game was showing, but the sound was drowned out by the music they were playing.  That was pretty disappointing, but I was happy that they were at least showing it.  Then the DJ (*sidenote: why is there even a DJ at a sports bar..?  Where there isn't even a dance floor..?) decided to crank the music.  When I say crank, I mean that my friend and I had to yell at each other to be heard - it was ridiculous.  I flagged down our waitress and asked if she'd mind asking the DJ to turn it down a few notches; there were other patrons who were visibly annoyed by it as well.  She gave me an apologetic look and said that the same thing happens every week: people complain about the volume, the DJ is asked to turn it down, he turns it down for about 10 mins, then turns it right back up.
For the type of establishment that this is supposed to be, I was extremely disappointed.  If I wanted obnoxiously loud club music where I can't hear my friend who's a foot and a half away from me, I would have gone to a club.
I can't comment on the food because I didn't order any.  The service was fine and our waitress was friendly.  I will never go back here though, what an annoying experience."}
{"text":"Staff was very rude. They sat us down at a dirty table that was sticky. Ordered appetizers and the waitress gave us dirty plates and silverware. Music was overly loud could not even hear my friends talk. Food is terrible and very pricey! Do not go here!!!!"}
{"text":"When I heard  about the real sports bar, I soon realize what a fake sports  bar is .. welcome to hoops... the service is kindna slow, food is horrible.. my tequila came from  mexico... hence why it took 15 mins to arrive and got taxed 8 ways... $16 a shot.  The fish is dry, the fries are soggy, n the calamari.. well.... the only thing Cajun  about them is the dirty water that they came from... mic drop"}
{"text":"As I was sitting down to eat dinner in my condo, my building erupted into flames. A friend passing by on the street phoned me to say that my fire alarm was legitimate and so I promptly evacuated the building. Thirsty from my 42 story descent, my friend kindly offered to buy me a beer at Hoops next door. I happily accepted and we took a seat at the bar. Later I was joined by two other displaced neighbours and we ordered a second round of beers.

Having missed my dinner due to the conflagration, I grew hungry and asked for a food menu. Realizing wings were on special I reviewed the sauces available and was intrigued by the last sauce \"teriyaki and jerk.\" In a classic case of confusion brought on by the lack of an Oxford comma, the waitress informed me that those were two separate sauces and not a unique Japanese-Jamaican fusion. Saddened, I ordered wings with a different sauce.

Sitting with my fellow evacuees we drank our beers and I waited for my wings. We hypothesized how long until we would regain entry to our homes and I waited for my wings. We finished our beers and I waited for my wings. A half hour later we saw the fire trucks leave, residents start returning to our building, and I waited for my wings.

Seeing we could return home, my neighbours and I asked for our bills and I asked for my wings to go.

\"Specials are dine in only,\" said the waitress.

\"Well, I'm only here because my building was on fire,\" I replied, hoping for an exception.

\"Most people are,\" she retorted.

\"Well, I don't really want the wings if I can't have them to go,\" I said truthfully, just wanting to return home.

The waitress left with a vague, noncommittal promise \"to check\" with someone.

Awhile later the waitress returned with the bills, giving them first to my neighbours, and then throwing my bill on the bar without apology or explanation simply stating, \"Specials are dine in only.\"

I looked at my bill, happy enough that they only charged me for my beer, and I paid what was owed.

My neighbours and I headed home, parting ways at the elevators. I returned to my condo and saw my now stale dinner sitting on the table--in my rush to leave I had forgotten to put it in the fridge. I reheated my dinner in the microwave, consoling myself that it likely still tasted better than Hoops wings, and I vowed that the next time my building erupts into flames I will walk a little farther to a nicer bar."}
{"text":"I'd give them no stars if I could.  The bartender was good.  Please close soon so someone else can come in."}
{"text":"Close to campus, decent food, good place to hang out with friends for a pint after class."}
{"text":"Never had eaten at this establishment but it being so close to the rogers centre, decided to try it out. Food & service were good but the manager on duty was unbelievable. He was rude as soon as we got to the front door. We had a guest inside waiting for us and he basically called us liars and said the resto was full. We walked right past him to find our friend. Tons of seating available inside i might add
Called him over to speak with him & again he was rude, unprofessional and a poor excuse for customer service. We will NEVER EVER return to Hoops. What a disgrace"}
{"text":"Went there on a wet Friday afternoon and it was a nice place to relax. Nothing too special going on so it was nothing to special to experience. The food was okay, nothing great but nothing bad either. Typical bar with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Yuck!  Let's see... the only way to describe this place is: dirty, over-priced and bland!  Save yourself and go two doors down to Quiznos if you need a quick bite, I wish we did.  Won't be going back... ever!"}
{"text":"I moved near Bremner for quite a while now, never tried this place due to the overwhelmingly low rating on yelp.

Worked overtime a couple of days ago, too late to cook, decided to give it a try. It's actually not that bad. Beer came fast and cold, wings were what you'd expect from a typical sports bar, salad was actually quite tasty even for a meatarian like me.

Service was pretty OK. The only thing I'd comment against is that this place feels kinda greasy and dirty. Overall 3 stars, plus 1 star for the nice surprise (that it's better than what I expected)"}
{"text":"Smelled like bleach inside, found a large shard of glass in a drink, alerted the waitress who said \"sorry Hun\" and couldn't finish but got charged for it anyway"}
{"text":"Came here to watch UFC because D&B was packed. It was a very busy night with only 3 waitresses so service was hard to get. Got 2lbs of honey garlic wings and fries. Wings were good but the fries were not even fries, they were crumbly bits. Friends got the steak sandwich and a pizza. Pizza was doughy and under cooked. The waitress thought the steak sandwiches were steak entrees and had to send the food back and tried to convince my friends to keep the side veggies the steaks came with instead of fries the sandwiches came with. When trying to leave (we left about an hour after the game, so it was pretty empty) it took about half an hour to get the bill."}
{"text":"Service was decent and so was the food (Mexican quesadillas), but the place was really dirty and greasy!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with my soccer team for the first and probably last time (last game of the season)

Their $34.99 deal for 3 lbs of wings and a pitcher of Canadian (and fries as it turns out)... that did not look like three pounds to me.. and the wings were pretty crappy.  Took forever to get the food though they did bring all the food for our party of 16 out at once.
Waitress forgot to ask us how we wanted our wings, and some other stuff.

Shockingly, they had Leffe Blonde on tap."}
{"text":"La portion Hamberger au menu enfant est particulièrement généreuse.

L'ensemble de nos plats étais aussi généreux avec des petites frites maison. 

La nourriture est bonnes

En plein été plutôt chaud, l'air climatisé est timide. 

Très long avant d'être accueilli par notre serveuse, malgré que le rush avant match viens tout juste de terminer. 

Est-ce que je recommande: Oui si vous n'êtes pas pressé
Est-ce que je vais y retourné:  Oui"}
{"text":"I recommend the pulled pork sandwich and the nachos with the hot chili on the side. It was delicious the food and the service is great."}
{"text":"The coconut shrimp are very good. The $3.xx charge for sweet potato fries is a little much, but that's just an opinion because we aren't from the area and do not know how expensive sweet potatoes can be.  We loved our server. Even under a lot of pressure as the Rotary convention dismissed and there were not enough menus or tables, she remained calm and got our order PERFECT. We'd love to call her by name but can't remember. She was on the patio, serving half of the tables. 

Why a 4/5? The kitchen was kind of slow and the portion sizes were smaller than we would have expected for the price. But overall, we enjoyed it and would come back when in Toronto."}
{"text":"Typical pub grub. Nothing fancy, but nothing bad either. Have happily eaten here a number of times before/after a Blue Jays game.

The layout of tables is a bit cramped but that aside it's a decent enough bar with plenty of TVs, so no problem in getting to see a screen from wherever you are."}
{"text":"Wow talk about service ... Apparently the day was too busy for the server to remember my order... I ordered sweet potato fries and we were going to order deserts but they ran out. The server came back and got my friends drink orders and didn't follow up with my food, but I didn't pay it any mind. The server suggested cris cut fries but totally forgot bout it because they didn't have any deserts. When the server came back and gave my friends their drinks, I followed up and asked for my sweet potato fries she said I didn't order fries from her. I saw the original server and asked her where my order was. This person said they completely forgot to pass it on but yet they had the time to suggest the crisscut fries. They both looked at each other confused and said I can just place another order. Why would I want to when my hunger already passed. On top of that they were not sincere nor did they care. That made me loose my appetite. Moments after they came with the girls drink and no apologies. When they cleared the table and the menus they didn't even say excuse me. Smh... What's that's about? Bad service!!!!"}
{"text":"not my favorite or even go to place 
the food was nothing special 
a bit over priced
great location tho 
the music physically was louder in the bathroom then in the resturant...not sure whats up with that"}
{"text":"I love how close this Hoops is to my place because it brings me back to my days at York - so huge points for nostalgia factor.  I've always enjoyed their wings and the beer is always frosty and decently priced.  There's a lot of stiff competition in the area, but Hoops holds its own.  Now if only I could convince them to have karaoke like their Northern counterpart :)"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon after visiting the CN tower. It was not busy at all! The service was average, but I really only saw my server when she took my order and when I got the bill. The food was average bar food, but they did give big portions. It was an OK experience."}
{"text":"It was ok. We came here on a busy night on a whim to watch some basketball. To get our tv changed to basketball was an enormous undertaking even though it shouldn't have been. Don't ask me why, but it took a REALLY long time to change the channel, and required 3 or 4 staff and a number of follow ups on our part.

Aside from that, it is your typical Hoops experience. Food wasn't that great, service was sub par (mostly slow), but our options were limited (Real Sports was packed for the night). If you're in a similar situation, and you have some friends hankering for some sports to watch, this is certainly an option."}
