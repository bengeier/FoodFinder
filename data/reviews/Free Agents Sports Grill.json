{"text":"So we came by 2 weeks ago and made reservations  for a birthday party... did I mention 2 weeks  ago?? Ok so we get here and they have given away our tables due to the game AFTER 2 WEEKS AGO MAKING RESERVATIINS AND HAVING 3 TIMES THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE  AT THE 1 TABLE THEY HAVE.... NOT happy, they  shoukd have called us or something,  we were even early. Not happy about this llace."}
{"text":"Bar food with an elevated twist, and done well. Atmosphere is typical sports bar with top notch service (bravo zulu to Missy behind the bar). I had the burger sliders with fries and jalapeno poppers, both excellent. Everything was noticeably made fresh, no premade, frozen shortcuts here. The sliders were served with marinated onions and peppers (yum) and the jalapeno poppers, which are truly the best I've ever had,  were made with fresh jalapenos, chipotle cream cheese, bacon, and a combo sauce drizzle that was simply delicious plus a scoop of fresh guacamole. Unequivocally recommended."}
{"text":"First time here with the girlfriend and our sever Felicia did a wonderful job finding out of the food was lactose friendly.  We ordered onion rings and they were fantastic.  Neither of us like over breaded fried foods and the onion rings were light and crispy.  The chicken sandwich my lady ordered was fantastic. The avocado was fresh and the bread was perfect. I ordered the ghost pepper burger and the patty was flavored with just the right amount of Worcester sauce.  The atmosphere and service was great, we will be back for more. Thanks Felicia"}
{"text":"Freaking awesome. My bartender was Corey. He was really nice about my difficult drink order and make it correctly the first time. The wings were so good. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Me and my family have come to free agents a few  times now and each time I've had a pleasant experience. The food has been very good.they have two electronic dartboard that we enjoy playing. The last time we went they had a live person singing for a few hours which was also enjoyable. We have become regulars there at least once or twice a week and will continue to do so . On a sidenote try the inside out nachos."}
{"text":"Stopped in a few days ago for a couple of beers and to look at the menu since we used to come here before when it was Game Time. The menu is very limited to pretty much burgers. The regular cheeseburger was almost $10 and the wings were 10 for $10. We decided that since the beer service was slow that food service would be worse and based on the fact for burgers wings & beer we would have been $50 for dinner - We left not to return. Good Luck"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service!! I love the atmosphere... From sitting by the bar and talking to the hilarious bartenders, to sitting at a booth and enjoying dinner, or playing darts and listening to great music. This place has it all and is an absolute 10!!!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday offers $1.50 tacos. We had the fish tacos, which were crispy and well prepared. The sauce was flavorful, and they offer Tapatio! We also ordered the onion rings, which appeared hand battered and also came out nice and crispy. 

The owner was extremely friendly, and we enjoyed our conversation with him. He was extremely welcoming to our group. The server was very nice, and she worked hard to ensure our large party was happy."}
{"text":"went there to watch  rousey vs holm ppv. stood at the desk for at least mins with the staff not even looking at us. one waitress even said hi to a couple next to us and walked away.  we left and i dont see going back."}
{"text":"Had the best Damn wing's.... And now they closed, search is on for a new place. I don't know what's wrong with that locating but i had my hopes that this one would have worked"}
