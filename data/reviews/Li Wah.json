{"text":"Li Wah used to deliver to us all the time. Now they wont :( delicious food just wish they would still deliver."}
{"text":"Decent dim sum that I would come back to, if I was in Cleveland, but not that great compared to LA or Houston.

For the amount of people, there were definitely not enough carts.  Also most of the dishese were room temperature to cold, so that was really disappointing.  Best dishes there, in my opinion, were the Daikon Cakes, the Sui Mai, and the pork ribs.  Again, not the best I've had, but the best options at Li Wah.  

Service was also just ok.  There wasn't a hostess when we arrived, just a cashier lady, who was too busy ringing people up to look at us.  So, we kind of stood around as a line of people formed behind.  And when we were done, we had to wait awhile for our check and finally gave up on them coming back to get the bill, so we just took the bill up ourselves."}
{"text":"The food is great here, but the service is horrible. You have to flag down a server to get them to take your order, or you will be sitting at a table forever.  Also, 99.9 1/2 of the servers and staff doesn't speak or understand English well. 

Basically, you have to point out what you want to order, on the menus--which is written in both Chinese and English. If you want refills on your tea or water, you have to flag down a server, as well. 

If it wasn't for the great food, I wouldn't come here at all. Their lunch special isn't that much of a deal. With my Shrimp Fried Rice lunch, I saved about a dollar--and received a small bowl of Won Ton Soup.

They have free WiFi here, which is good. And they have their own Private Parking Lot."}
{"text":"I've gotten hooked on some of the delicious dishes at Li Wah!  I have eaten at this restaurant only on the weekends between 10:30 am and noon.  I don't like waiting for a table, and this place is packed after noon.  Also, the earlier you get there after the restaurant opens, the more chances you have getting the food that you like will be available.

I recommend the tripe, ha gow (shrimp dumpling), shu mai (pork dumplings), ha chun fun (shrimp wrapped in rice noodle with a sauce), pei dan juk / congee (rice porridge with preserved duck egg), sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, sweet tofu, and pork spare ribs.  Sorry for any of the misspellings of the dishes, but I'm going by what the servers call them as they push their carts throughout the restaurant and ask diners at each table if they're interested in what they have.  There are a lot more dishes available, but these are my favorites.  Most of the time, I can understand what the servers are saying, but sometimes ... (???)  If it looks good, I will try it anyway.  I always ask for a small dipping bowl of sriracha (hot chili sauce) to spice up the dumplings.

When you are seated at your table, the hostess will ask what you'd like to drink, and leave a piece of paper with Chinese (I assume) characters on it.  Whenever you get food dishes off of the carts, the server will place a mark on the piece of paper so that the cashier will know what to charge you at the end.  Most of my favorite dishes (see above) are $3 per order, which, in the case of the dumplings, is 4 dumplings per order. 

Oh, and don't get the regular hot tea that they bring to the table.  Ask for the more flavorful gok po (black tea with chrysanthemum).

LI Wah is located in the Asian Plaza at Payne and East 30th.  Although there are lots of spaces in the parking lots around the plaza, they can fill up on the weekends by noon as diners and shoppers head to the restaurants and stores.

I have always experienced great service at Li Wah.  Even though there are a lot of tables, the servers move the carts quickly, empty dishes are removed and empty glasses are filled efficiently."}
{"text":"One star is a lot for this resturant, don't be fooled by the pictures , I ordered a chicken plate for to go and a sea food plate, 95% of the plate was a vegetables and 5% is a chicken. It was really hard to find chicken in the plate. It's a $13 plate why I can't find chicken??"}
{"text":"I grew up on Li Wah dim sum. I've had dim sum in other big cities and I realize that there is incredible dim sum out there. But for Cleveland, this is pretty decent. They provide all the staples that a dim sum restaurant serves and they have aisles big enough to fit carts down. I know it's part of the dim sum mystique, but it drives me nuts when you go to a restaurant and the carts are playing bumper cars with your chairs.

So food and space is great. What has been hit and miss is the service. Here is the scene:

MOM: (politely in chinese) \"hello, where can we get some egg custards\"
SERVER: (annoyingly in chinese) \"over there\" (points to a cart that is right next to our table that we already looked at that didn't have any egg custards).

REALLY, THE CART RIGHT NEXT TO OUR TABLE IS WHERE WE GET FOOD IN A DIM SUM RESTAURANT???? Why didn't we think of that??? Stupid us, we were looking for the speaker box so that we could order our egg custards with a side of super sized fries!!!!

That was a miss. Then it became a hit because the next server we asked actively finished her current task and looked for a plate of egg custards for us. 

So Li Wah, pretty good dim sum, sketchy service."}
{"text":"I visited Cleveland for a day.  I wanted to get \"good\" Chinese food.  I tried this place because of reviews.  I ordered dim sum, honestly, I did not like it at all, neither did my friend.  Soup and fried rice tasted like as if they used some instant mix or something.  We were very disappointed at this place.  I just have to say this place is in a shopping center.  It took a while to find this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian restaurant in Cleveland. Although they do serve \"Americanized Chinese food\"  like your General Tsos etc. I would not go here for that. What makes this place great is their \"Dim Sum\" style. Old Chinese women come around with carts serving everything from dumplings to chicken feet. They have over 20 types of dumplings that are all phenomenal. My favorite dumplings are the \"Su Mai\" filled with pork. You will get the largest selection on the weekend where they also have large entrees like duck and shrimp. I will warn you ahead of time that you will have a difficult time communicating with the staff as they speak very little English. I believe they only do the dim sum until about 2:00. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I went on the day of the Asian Festival and I was still able to get my meal quickly, my server was friendly. My only gripe is that when I first entered, the greeted was cold and standoffish, which annoys me greatly. However, the rest of my experience was great and I will be going back. Also, unlike many Asian restaurants, I didn't come out smelling like fried food."}
{"text":"Li wah is one of the more authentic Chinese restaurants in Cleveland. Get there on Sundays for dim sum before the crowds do. This place gets crazy especially around Chinese holidays. It's sometimes tough to get the staffs attention with it being so busy. Favorite dish here was the pan fried noodles."}
{"text":"\"I wish there was real Chinese food in Cleveland.\" This reminded me of the plot engine of TH White's retelling of Arthurian legend, most specifically the bildungsroman of Arthur's maturation as he proceeds through challenges given him by Merlyn. Also, I was hungry.

So, I said, \" I [think I] know of a place!\" I'd heard of some dumpy Cantonese trough, in a paycheck-loan part of town, that has lines out the door on weekends. So out comes my Treo 700p (I hate iphones), and soon enough -- thanks to my alacrity with the Y, E, L, and P keys on the tiny keyboard -- I'd found the place, or at least its address.  Click, tap, tap... \"Hi, how late are you open? How late open today? Umm, today, you close, when?\" \"We close 1AM.\" Paydirt.

It's in what appears to be a former methadone clinic on Payne Avenue. They try to make it an \"Asian Mall,\" but really, Li Wah wears the pants in this \"mall.\" Dimsum (3 items for $12: well, the good things in life are sometimes expensive) is served all day, and is very decent, or if you prefer, indecent. Tofu skin rolls, yes. Cilantro dumpling thingies, yes. Egg noodles with roast duck, YES. Even almond jelly dessert stuff. And they have lots of Forbidden Kung Pao Chicken and Beef With Ancient Mysterious Broccoli type dishes for gw-- well, let's not be racist here!

Service is a comedy of extremes. Grumbling and sighs if they don't know you. Creepily over-warm if at any time in the past year you have  given them any sort of tip. And when you go back to your car, wave a 
friendly lei-ho to the cook guys standing behind the back entrance and smoking.

All this, in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I love li wah. This was the first place I ever had Chinese food with more variety than a typical takeout place. I love their Chinese vegetable dishes. I love that they're open late so you can eat after a concert or other performance without feeling rushed. I also love that sometimes late at night there will be people performing karaoke."}
{"text":"Why all the great reviews??? Maybe the Dim Sum is a bag 'o chips and all that but the food is horrendous...come on people...they're using Minute Rice, watering down the Duck sauce, and dishing out  egg rolls filled with celery. Portion size is what you'd get at a Nursing Home. When I asked the waitress for some fresh duck sauce..... because the one she brought was sour and not fresh she looked at me like I had five heads....... Disgusted with me she took the bottle and returned with 2 packets of carry out sauce which is worse than the sour one. She sure showed me didn't she. I should have realized what was ahead after that bowl of Won-Ton with ONE noodle."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in cleveland! 
Alot of variety in menu, good portion , reasonable price. 
However, it is always crowded and sometimes long wait."}
{"text":"Dim sum selection was decent.  I liked the pan-fried turnip cakes, siu mai and pork buns.

However, the \"kai lan\" vegetables in oyster sauce was lamentable.  The shoots were old and thick, and I could hardly bite through them. It was so bad that I had to spit it out."}
{"text":"We came to Li Wah to entertain several guests.  We ordered authentic Chinese dishes and unfortunately none of them were good.  They were all cold and they didn't have any distinguishing flavor.  The roast duck was cold and salty.  Eggplant in a casserole with salt fish had no salt fish and the eggplant was deep fried and burnt.  The beef with tendon casserole tasted old.  The server suggested a scallop with black pepper dish - the scallops were small and haphazardly fried with a few slivers of green peppers and onions.  The only dishes that were decent were the stir fried vegetables: pea tips with garlic, and kong xin cai with garlic....but it's difficult to get those dishes wrong.

I would definitely not go here again."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Cleveland-area and have been going here for years with family. A must go to place for dim sum in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Tender snowpea tips/shoots, kung pao tofu, string beans, and noodles are some of the veggie options. The dining room is large and well decorated - fit for a Chinese king! Of course, in China the centuries-old dynasty system of kings was overthrown in 1911 with the founding of the Republic of China (ROC) government by Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, so I guess no more emperors will grace the throne of this restaurant. Well, I guess current Chinese political leaders could seem like kings, but then again, even if they were, why would they visit Cleveland?

Yeah, come here to eat if you're in town, but afterwards, make your way out of the state to Chicago or Pittsburgh before your stomach gets hungry again. Maybe you'll eat like a king/queen in those cities..."}
{"text":"Sorry, you guys. For Cleveland, this is an okay dim sum joint. But by Chinese standards it is just average. Compared to an average place in San Francisco or even Seattle, SNORE. If you want some really great dim sum, try Ton Kiang in San Francisco way out on Geary Street. At Li Wah, the flavors all blend together and the order-off-the-menu items are gloppy. The portions are disgustingly huge. If you must go, the best day to go is Saturday. That's when they have the best selection. If they come by with a huge wok-ful of mussels, I would recommend that. I wouldn't go on Sunday...too crowded and not worth the wait. The bathrooms are really dirty and smell bad. It's like pulling teeth to get some hot chili oil. Very, very average Chinese food."}
{"text":"I was super excited to eat here on Christmas. We recently moved to Cleveland from Chicago and a fellow foodie recommended it. We got egg drop soup, shrimp dumpling, sweet and soup chicken and my hubby got beef and broccoli. 

We should have turned around as soon as we got there. I can't believe how busy it was. I found it greasy, disgusting and hardly qualified as food. The soup was oily, shrimp tasty funny and chicken greasy and mystery meat beef. Don't go here - stay away. 

My parents were visiting my sister in San Fran eating spectacular dim sum. So jealous and disapointed with our choice. Again, I looked around and other people were eating going about their business. I wanted to vomit. 

 Hope to find some good Chinese in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Went to Li Wah for Thanksgiving, which is depressing on both sides. Took forever to be acknowledged after being seated, 30 mins to get tea, dirty linen, dirty plates, big crash from the fish tank area and a mouse trap came flying through the dining room. Tried speaking to management about the awful service, did nothing to help, and at the end got stiffed on the almond cookies and oranges as a final f* you. Food was mediocre but felt ok not eating much because the restaurant was filthy. Would have gone elsewhere but no one was open :("}
{"text":"Usually when come to this place for some good Chinese food, I always bring my large family. Today was totally different because I had my daughter with me. I don't know how many times I had to as k for water, fork, and another plate. Regardless, if my daughter is only 2 years old. I shouldn't have to do a waiters or waitress job in getting what I need. I had to wave my hand like I was in some high school to get one of the ladies pushing the cart to bring me some food. All they ever did was go to the large families first before me. I had enough and order the food to go. Once I did that, a waitress came to me and said \"You gonna tip?\" Her accent was so thick that I had to ask her several times what she said. Finally the casher told her that I was going to tip because I needed change. I felt insulted and harass for what she said. So I totally ignored her like I been for 45 minutes with the food and my items. But I did leave her a tip as well...Next time, give service to everyone and not just the big tables with large families."}
{"text":"Awful! The pork shau-mai and hargow I ordered were room temperature off the cart. Can you say \"danger zone?\" When I complained to the waiter he shot a look that was a combination of \"I couldn't care less\" and \"watch me pretend I can't understand you.\" Overall service was slow and indifferent, carts were infrequent, food quality was poor. Li Wah used to be the place to go for dim sum in Cleveland but now it's a place to avoid."}
{"text":"Many of the reviews here provide critical commentary on the quality of Li Wah's dim sum (lunch). My review will not attempt to dispute this. Instead, I will provide an assessment on their dinner menu based on my experience. 

So I came here for dinner and ordered several items, none of which was extraordinary. The items were extremely greasy and salty. Aside from these two characteristics, the flavors did not stand out in any way. They used large quantities of soy sauce in cooking their fried rice. The color of the rice was a heavy, dark brown; it was almost atrocious. The vegetable and meat dishes were glistening with grease, kinda like Pat Riley's hair. I felt extremely bloated and stagnant afterward. 

But all things considered, Li Wah is, in fact, located in Cleveland; as such, it would be dishonest and unfair to hold them to the standards set forth by Chinese restaurants in California, Vancouver, or New York. At the end of the day, I am glad they are there, and based on the reviews of other Yelp users, I am sure their dim sum is noteworthy."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've experienced an actual authentic Chinese restaurant. I only ordered one dim sum dish that was pretty tasty. My Main course was the szechuan chicken and my friends dish was the Thai curry chicken. I requested the dish to be extra spicy which it was not, nor was it even slightly spicy at all. In the end when we were paying for our meals separately and they charged us an extra 10$ (5$ a piece) for no apparent reason. We asked about it and two waitress tried to argue there was no mistake. One tried to say its for taxes. There's no such thing as 5$ for taxes with 10-15 dollar dishes. Eventually another waitress came by and said its wrong, which after we got 5$ each in cash for being over charged. Besides the non spicy dish I ordered and being overcharged, I MIGHT come here again, just for the \"authentic\" experience. **Make sure you're not overcharged."}
{"text":"Today's lunch stop in Cleveland's little Asia town was at Li Wah restaurant on Payne Avenue. The place is in a little shopping center, that also houses the 30th Street Cafe. It was packed when I walked in, but I was seated pretty quickly.

I tried the shrimp dumpling dim sum, which was exactly the same as the one I had a few days ago at Bo Loong, I mean exactly the same - I actually thought that there's one vendor who supplies dim sum to all the asian restaurants around town.

And just as at Bo Loong, I had the Szeschuan shrimp, and hot and sour soup. Again, the soup seemed just like the one I had a few days ago at BL. The main entree was a little different, but good. If anything, the portion was a bit on the smaller side compared to BL, and there were definitely fewer shrimp in today's dish at Li Wah.

The service was fine, nothing to write home about, but I'm beginning to see that at these types of places, like Siam Cafe, Bo Loong, Li Wah, it's not about the service, but rather about the food. One exception I've found was at No. 1 Pho, where both the food and the service were very good.

Will be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Since moving to the east from Texas, I wanted to find a dim sum spot that was just as good if not better than the dim sum places in Houston. As with any dim sum place, I really don't expect good service. This place was no different, and most of the staff didn't speak English. I even tried to ask about a speciality dish, and after going through about 3 people, the third person told me they were out. The food was pretty good, and tasted what I'm used to. My husband and I will get our normal plates: barbecue pork steamed buns, sui mai, chicken feet, pork ribs, sesame balls, egg custard, shrimp rice noodles, and sticky rice. You have to make sure you hit a good time...if you go to early, the good carts don't come out until later. If you come too late...then you have to wait in a super long line because it's packed. Next time I'm craving dim sum, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Li Wah many times, and got take out here last night.  I had Chicken Lo Mein, Pepper Steak with Onions and Peppers, and Dou Miao with garlic (pea shoots).  The Lo Mein was very buttery, a little more than I would like, but it was good.  The pepper steak was made with fatty steak, which I hate.  However, this is what I expect to get in Chinese food.  My boyfriend really liked it.  The Dou Miao was great.

There is a dish they have here, with noodles and small pieces of beef that I would like to try again, but I don't know what it is called.  The problem is that I used to come here with Chinese people who ordered for me.  Like most Chinese places, you can order whatever Chinese dishes you want here, if you are Chinese.  If you don't speak Chinese, you are limited to the English menu.  If you have any Chinese friends who know their cuisine, come with them."}
{"text":"Li Wah was very busy on a Sunday lunch time. The atmosphere is beautiful there are chandeliers, statues of a dragon and phoenix, overall the atmosphere is great. 

If you don't know what Li Wah is main for, I'll tell you. Li wah or dim sum is mainly a restaurant where the staff pushes carts around the restaurant filled with food. The only downside is that the carts don't always make it to you. I was REALLY hoping for a stripe, but the cart was ALWAY on the other side of the room. I had to ask one of the staff if they could bring it to me, it took about 5 minutes for me to get one dish. 

The food is okay, the roared duck was oily. The moment you take you fist bite you get the fist taste of oil. Also the dick was a little dry. But there   soft tofu dessert was excellent, if you thought it wasn't sweet enough you could always ask for more if there syrup.

The restaurant in my opinion deserves a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"My family came here for a birthday dinner and ordered a Peking duck, but were served with a plate of duck skin with lots of hairs and some ridiculous lies. I will never come back again and I would recommend the same for your health.

While we ordered the food, the manager and the waitress persuaded us to order a full size pecking duck or roasted duck which is about $35. There were both half size and full size available, and we didn't feel it's necessary to order the full size because we still want to try other entrees. However, the manager and the waitress kept talking and talking. My family didn't want to make it a bad night for a birthday dinner and finally compromised and ordered the full size pecking duck along with a few other things.

The waitress promised that she would start serving us food in 3-5 minutes but only came back after more than 30 minutes. She brought a plate of duck skin with LOTS OF long hair on it. It's even difficult to find a piece without hair. I asked her how comes there's so much hair and where is the meat? We ordered duck or duck skin! She said \"this is what you ordered. Our Pecking duck is like this. The duck is skinny\". Then I stopped their manager and told him this is so gross and not hygienic. How can my family eat the duck skin with hairs? He said he would figure out what's happening. Then after that, the manager tried to avoid making eye contact with us until we waited for another 30 minutes and stopped him again. He told us this was not their fault because the duck they bought has hairs on it. My father said \"then it is the problem of the person who raised the duck - he raised the duck with hairs\". The manager said \"that's right\" and immediately turned away and ignored us from then on. 

At this point, we still had three other entrees and we might be able to ignore the hairy duck and finish the dinner. But the waitress might suddenly realize our upset could hurt her tips and came back with a full plate of duck meat and then stopped by again and again with different ridiculous \"excuses\". First, she, who is the person once saying \"our duck is like this\", told us it is healthier to eat duck with hairs, because it means that the duck meat was processed naturally. Then she came back every 5 minutes with a different excuse, such as \"American don't minding eating duck with hair\", \"nobody complaint the hairs on the duck before\", \"she is only working here less than a year, so she doesn't know the entrees well\", etc. Our family couldn't have conversations among ourselves at all and we didn't want to talk to the waitress any more. We ended up packing all unfinished food other than the duck and left very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a really nice dim sum brunch on a Saturday here. The food was fresh, authentic, and delicious: mussels, bbq pork buns, pork and shrimp dumplings, chicken and pig's feet, beef tendon, turnip cake, xiajiao, and preserved egg and pork congee were all winners. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for Dim Sum on Chinese New Year...  Was greeted by a long, long line extending out of the restaurant and Lion Dancer's.  I've been here before - it's always packed - with mostly Asian folks, which is a good sign.

I've only been here for Dim Sum, and the Dim Sum is good, solid Cantonese style, with a decent variety.  They have things that will meet a midwestern palate, such as shumai, char siu (basically bbq pork) but also more traditional offerings, such as all things tripe :), mung bean pastries, asian greens, and chicken feet (which I haven't tried, but hear they are good).

Don't expect many vegetarian options.  Don't expect it to be east/west coast.  Expect it to be good, pretty authentic, and a fun way to spend a saturday afternoon.  Try the custard filled buns - they are unassuming, but wonderful.  You'll be hooked, I promise."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here since I was like 6. Everything I've tried (aside from the chicken feet...not my thing) has been wonderful. The service is always good and it's generally pretty packed. I do think the dim sum is better than their lunch/dinner selections. I take my friends here whenever I can!"}
{"text":"My favorite dish from there is steam tilapia, yum yum... This restaurant is known for dim sum, I enjoy it too.. In my opinion, it's the only best dim sum in Cleveland Ohio... I had it from other places but Li Wah by far is the best.. 

Ps: don't set your expectations too high, you ARE in Cleveland, it cannot ever be compare to big cities such as New York, California, or Chicago... Just Saying"}
{"text":"This is the only dim sum I've experienced in Cleveland but have visited many in NYC, SFO and up and down the coasts.

That said, it's fairly authentic and therefore a pretty good choice. They use carts which I prefer because the food comes fast and furious. A good selection of just about everything with few exceptions. Fresh fish in the tanks and a small butcher area for take out pork, chicken, duck, etc.

It's a decent sized restaurant so you're almost always guaranteed a table or a very short wait. Parking can fill up but the main street provides easy alternatives to the lot.

The restaurant is in a strip mall of sorts that's connected to some souvenir shops, small businesses and the Park To Shop Asian grocery. Visiting each of these after our meal and loading up on low cost groceries at PTS has become a ritual.

Allocate a few hours and you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"Not clean. I found an eyelash in one of my dishes...

And I ate the part that touched the hair... it was so disgusting and I lost my appetite..
They cancelled the dish and apologized once but that still doesn't make me feel any better about eating food that is dirty.
Disgusting"}
{"text":"Cleveland just doesn't have good dim sum.  Li Wah has gone downhill and uses some frozen products.  I don't like that.  If you want good dim sum the closest is in Toronto.  If you want average dim sum this will fill the bill.  Frankly though you are better off going to Park To Shop and buying your own frozen and then steaming it at home.  Frankly, I think that is where Li Wah gets some of their dim sum."}
{"text":"I used to get lunch here at least once a week since it's so close. The food is actually really good, the service ok, but the prices are outrageous. $9 for veggie fried rice and a side of sauce (Hunan) is $2. But that wasn't the problem for me. It was the fact that halfway through my fried rice I saw a dead cockroach hiding in my meal. I have not eaten here since and not one of my co-workers has either. This place was a weekday lunch staple. WATCH OUT!"}
{"text":"i've not had their dim sum.  so i can't yelp it.
but i can yelp their generic chinese cantonese menu.

not so much.

sicky sickerson, guys.
general tso obviously conquered my stomach and tore some shit up.
i'm just sayin'"}
{"text":"Decided to try Li Wah based on reviews from a food delivery service and am very impressed! My boyfriend and I ordered Green Beans, Orange Chicken, steamed dumplings and a few pork buns. Everything was very fresh and delicious. I was blown away by how the chicken was all succulent white meat, freshly tossed with orange slices and chilies. I can't remember the last time I had chicken that juicy. I also noticed the dishes were rather light and healthy- so I didn't immediately need a nap after eating (No MSG). How refreshing! Their homemade buns are a must; light and fluffy dough with savory pork and veggie filling. Needless to say, I'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for many years, NEVER disappointed! Recommend the DIMSUM....BEST IN TOWN!"}
{"text":"Very solid Chinese food! Haven't done the Dim Sum (would like to try that soon -- I'm getting in the mood for a pork bun again), but we ordered dinner from here tonight.

My husband decided to get the steamed dumplings and the crab rangoon. He loved the dumplings and said they were \"the best ever,\" but could take or leave the rangoon. I tasted it and thought they were flavorful, but a bit strange to eat. Where do I start? Do I save the inside for last? Etc. Maybe I'm just a bit deficient in my rangoon-eating tactics.

The wonton soup was very good -- not the best -- but had the following under control: broth (chock full of pork and scallions) and wonton flavor and size. The wonton dough was a bit on the softer, slippery side, and I kinda like when it's a bit chewier and thicker (and harder to just cut with your spoon, making it more difficult to eat, but hey! I'm a weirdo). There was still a lot of dough, though (does it actually qualify as \"dough?\" Maybe I should be saying \"noodles\"), and for that I was appreciative.

Chicken and broccoli was a winner. Great sauce, LOTS of food. Had those crinkle-cut carrots as well as mushrooms. Did I mention I hate mushrooms in Chinese food? As well as in most other foods, except on pizza. This dish was just a BIT overseasoned, though -- I guess I just mean salty. I've been watching too much Top Chef again.

Overall, very nice dishes! Will order again."}

{"text":"Had a big family holiday gathering (10 people, ages 12-92) and decided to go out for Chinese food. With all our complicated likes/dislikes, orders, changing our minds, figuring it all out, the waitstaff was amazing. They got it right with only one small mistake that they fixed right away. The food was great. Everybody found something they liked, and many of us found we liked something we did not expect to enjoy. It was all a great success!"}
{"text":"Passing thru on way to Chicago. Didn't have a chance for \"Dim Sum\" but had a wonderful dinner there. The dishes we had were better than I had recently in NY. Price is reasonable too.  Definitely am recommending this place."}

{"text":"Food poisoning alert: my whole family got sick from eating this place! 


I frequent this place for dim sum, they are not the best but they are decent in the area. 

While the food is decent, my only complaint is their service and cleanness. The table cloth on are table was filthy when they sat us down. Not a big deal but definitely have me question on their sanitary. 

Service is bad, no question ask. I won't be back."}

{"text":"It's the only place in town for good dim sum. Today was not such a crazy busy morning here. We were sat promptly and we received excellent service. 

Exterior: located in Asia Plaza around East 30th in Cleveland. 

Interior: Asian decor. Green lights along the ceiling. Roasting whole ducks in a case. Bright red columns with gold Asian writing in then. It's a large restaurant that can accommodate a lot of people and large parties. 

Clientele: there are a lot of Asian people here. That's a good sign. Anybody who loves this type of food could be here. 

Food: I personally think it's excellent. Good Chinese is hard to find. This is as authentic as it gets. They have several off menu selections that most people would not order. They have tripe and weird organ dishes. 

Final thoughts: we had excellent service today. The food was wonderful!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice for dim sum. There can be a long line but it moves very quickly, especially if you are willing to combine parties with others to get a bigger table. 

The location is in a shopping plaza with a grocery, pharmacy, a number of small shops, and another restaurant. 

The variety of dim sum is good, however, it is hard sometimes to get the cart you want and they do not seem to come by as quickly as we would like. We would waited a good ten minutes before another cart would come by.  The chicken feet, peaking duck, and egg pancake were awesome. My son loved the pork spring rolls. Also, some of the best wonton soup I have ever had. 
 
The waiter for drinks is practically non existent...no refills for the majority of the meal. Getting the check is a struggle then too, we waited 15 mins just to get our check."}
{"text":"I liked LiWah overall. I didn't dine in so I cannot comment on service inside the restaurant. I can say my order was ready quickly and came out hot. The people who work there don't speak the best English but I don't go to a Chinese restuarant or conversation. i.e who friggin cares. The food was good and had good flavors. I didn't need to add soy to everything to get it to taste better. I had Chicken Chow Mein and Kung Po Chicken (nice spice level). I did get spring rolls but they were over cooked and little greasy. That was my only bummer.
The decor was nice. It was clean and welcoming. I liked the market building it was in. Reminds me of being in China.
Overall, I give it 4 stars based on this go around.
I will go back and recommend Li Wah."}
{"text":"The dim sum here is alright, but now I feel sad that people drive the 2 hrs from Pittsburgh just to eat here... since it's only ok.

I think my main complaint is that there is no variety. There might be 10 different things on one of the carts, but they're all variations of the same salty and fatty ground meat in the dumplings/shumai/just as meatballs. And the meat is so greasy that after a few bites you begin to feel sick. The selection of sweet stuff is a bit better, but still, not many options.

Also a bit expensive. We spent $40 between 2 people here. In other cities, $30 easily feeds 4."}
{"text":"Really good. Best Chinese I've had in Cleveland. Food is fresh and place is clean. The price is also very good. I think I wish the service was a bit more friendly, but they were fast and I'll will go back."}
{"text":"Standard dim sum. Satisfies your dim sum hankering. Except today the cha siu baos tasted rancid. Mentioned to waitress and got typical Chinese defense , \"they were made this morning\".  I don't think so, or else why would I take one bite and leave 2 1/2 buns on plate - and refuse to have them packed \"to go\"?  I ain't lying."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday for Dim sum lunch after reading all the great reviews and ignoring the bad reviews. As expected the restaurant is busy we shared table with another couple because they didn't have any open tables for two but because of that some food carts that goes around all the tables just skips us because our table is near the wall and not too many guests were in that corner, this didn't bother me. I thought the food was kind of meh... nothing special, it reminded me of the frozen stuff you can just buy from Asian grocery  stores nothing tastes fresh. 

On top of that, the service was lousy, they were quick to bring the bill and take my credit card but when I asked for a box to take home the leftovers nobody seemed to remember. we had asked 3 different workers and every one of them walked past our table again and again with things for new customers but no take home box; pretty rude to just ignore customers after the bill is paid. After 15 minutes of waiting we just left the leftovers it's really not something I want to eat later anyway. I feel sorry for the Clevelanders thinking this place is special."}
{"text":"This is my go to dimsum place in cleveland, very authentic and large quanities of food for a very good price, i strongly recommend the siumai and the bbq pork buns"}
{"text":"Cravings for Dim-Sum?  For Mid-west Dim-Sum , this place isn't bad.  They have most of the dishes you could ask for, and most of the people with the carts understand what you want, if not, do what I do and point.  There are a few things that are not on the carts and you have to track someone down to get that, but they are usualyl quite fast and happy to bring it to you.  

If you go a on a weekend after 11 be prepared to wait.  Be aware that they do charge you by the portion.  When I've gone there, there are always people who have never had this before and I always feel bad when they get the bill."}
{"text":"The sweet and sour chicken is good. On Sundays they have a food cart that goes around, it's horrible."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. Always a big favorite for my boyfriend and I whenever we go to Chinatown. The service is fast and very friendly. The food is fantastic and authentic. There's so much variety, huge portions, and the prices are super reasonable. Expect to take home leftovers. And pace yourself, because the deserts are worth trying.. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Dim sum review ONLY.  Been here a bunch of times (which is really the only way to truly gauge a restaurant).  Bottom line: Quality of dim sum here is on par with most of dim sum houses I've visited while living in NYC (and I've been to most there, multiple times a piece).  That includes Manhattan, BK, and Flushing Chinatowns.  My China-born/raised (and later NYC-raised) wife feels the same.  Food seems as fresh as any other dim sum we've had, contrary to some of the other reviews here.  For those with a semi-sweet tooth, the dan tat (egg tart) and Malay-go (sponge cake) are off the chain.  Ask for them if you don't see any floating around on the carts.  Chicken feet, char siu, various bao (buns, sweet or savory), lo-bah-go (turnip cake), pi-gwut (short ribs), cheung-fun (noodles filled with beef or shrimp)... all legit.  As with any dim sum joint, go with a group, because the more people you have the more you can sample.  Noon on the weekends seems like THE time to go.  Go too early or too late and you run the risk of a limited selection on the carts.  Oh and be sure to stick with the Cantonese fare.  I wouldn't expect dim sum chefs to really nail down the Northern dishes (e.g. xiao long bao), which they do offer here although they are not typically found in most dim sum spots.  Dim sum = Cantonese, so, Cantonese/Toisan speaking servers.  But you only need to ask to see what they have and point to what you want, so that shouldn't be too much of a problem.  Ho-ho sik!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now for dimsum and gotta say, it's so far the best for me in Cleveland. The carts are flowing with yummy steamed dishes, and the food is all delicious! Come here if you want to try some real Chinese cuisine! Dimsum for two people usually ends up being aorund 15-20 dollars. The place is HUGE and would be ideal for parties and very Chinese in decor with lanterns, red walls, dark glazed wood furniture, and fish tanks where you could pick your own dinner. They also sell Chinese barbeque pork and Beijing duck as well. This is a great place for a real Chinese food experience."}
{"text":"I moved to columbus, OH from the Bay Area; the golden states where dim sum is known to be the best.  This place is better than any restaurants in OHIO!!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I have had dim sum pretty much everywhere -- from NYC to LA to Dallas to Chicago and even in Jackie Chan's restaurant in South Korea. 

Li Wah has GOOD dim sum. They don't have as many selections as most places, but that is probably why they can afford to keep their food fresh. I've only been here on a weekend for brunch, so I can't speak for the weekday dim sum, but I doubt there would be much demand for it in Ohio so I can imagine the quality takes a bit of a dive on the slow days. It's definitely the best you'll find if you're in or around Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I'm going to lay it out there...the dim sum scene in Columbus, OH sucks...it's atrocious. To say there is a scene would be so false. That's why on my recent visit to the CLE, when I had a dim sum itch, I knew I had to hit up Li Wah. Now, I've been here several times in the past. After all, I spent 4 long years of college in the CLE, as well as many visits to friends who remained thereafter. All I can say is while they're not on the level of NYC, Taiwan, San Fran, or Chicago, this place is pretty good and can definitely hold their own. 

The prices are fair. The decor is what you'd expect for a Chinese restaurant. They push carts around with all the food so service is quick. Will definitely return for as long as they are open."}
{"text":"Dinning at Li Wah is always enjoyable for the family, we tend to go there for Dim Sum and have been there several times for dinner. Li Wah is one of the only authentic Chinese restaurants we have found in the greater Cleveland area, their dishes in Dim Sum are similar to places we have eaten in Hong Kong and come out on traditional carts. Some favorites are the Pork Congee, Shrimp Balls (sometimes you need to order as they do not always have these on the carts). The pork with black bean is yummy, while the Shrimp with Eggplant is a must if you like Eggplant! 
Would highly recommend Li Wah and will be visiting there again soon!"}
{"text":"Dim sum is decent. We got bad tripe....service was horrible and they def need more carts! Prob go back someday, but not soon! Ok for the area, but not worth the drive to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Who would've thought Cleveland would be home to amazing dim sum? I've had dim sum in New York City, but the dim sum experience at Li Wah is my favorite. We love going on a Saturday or Sunday morning. Li Wah has a great variety of quality dim sum, friendly cart-pushers, and a fun ambiance. The jiaozi (potstickers) rock! The rice congee isn't half bad either. Delicious, noisy fun for the whole family."}
{"text":"I'm from Pittsburgh and this is the closest place to me for good dim sum. And I swear I will be back to Cleveland very often just to stop here. Sunday mornings here are so so so busy and we were lucky to beat the rush the day of our visit (come early before noon). 

Having no dim sum places around where I'm from, I've never had an authentic dim sum experience before, when there are carts going around and you just point out what you want. I didn't know what to expect going in, but I loved it here! Everything we tried was fresh and delicious. The service was good, despite there being a language barrier at times since I'm not Chinese. 

I absolutely cannot wait to come back to Cleveland, literally just to visit Li Wah!"}
{"text":"I only go there for dim sum.  Every time I go, I get disappointed because variety is limited, service is not attentive, carts are not moving around, ...  and I swear that I will not come back.  Then after a while, I crave for dim sum and I will come back since it is the only dim sum place in this area."}
{"text":"Tried it again today for Chinese new year as my husband wanted to go there. Nothing changed: there was no line, but we were not seated for 5 minutes; the dim sum was limited and cold; and we had to wait again to pay the bill. Overall, still the same bad restaurant and it caused an upset on Chinese new year. No clue what is going on as even the bad Chinese restaurants in Massachusetts and New Jersey are not this bad. Makes you really miss Asia... With lots of regret if you dine here for dim sum."}
{"text":"Li Wah is like the miracle of the loaves and fish.  No matter how many or how few people come with us, no matter how much we eat, the end bill is always exactly $11 per person.  And it's well worth it.  

Li Wah offers a good selection of the standard Dim Sum fare, and the food is tasty.  It ranges from the standard (pork rolls, shrimp) all the way up to the weird stuff like duck's feet and large slabs of broccoli.  The restaurant is crowded for Dim Sum and don't ever expect to have your drinks refilled unless you ask aggressively, but overall this is a great way to spend a weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Great dim sum! I grew up in Hong Kong, where is famous for dim sum. This place serves pretty authentic dim sum. I travelled to Cleveland for a short weekend getaway and tried to find good Chinese restaurants. We found Li Wah was rated as the best dim sum in town. 
If you get there during their peak hours, probably 12 -2 pm, please expect some wait. Try to avoid those hours and skip the wait. 
We got there around 1, which has a long line in front of us, and most of the people are party of 3 or more. With just 2 of us, we were able to skip the line and get a 2-person small table almost right away.
Their dim sum were nothing fancy, just like one of those small dim sum place in Hong Kong for local people. They have a wide range of varieties. While enjoying their dim sum on the salty side, don't forget to order the tofu dessert!! 
If I happened to travel to Cleveland again, I will definitely stop by for their dim sum! And I'll recommend Li Wah to others!"}
{"text":"Service is good, traditional Cantonese way. However the food is not as good. The shrimp domplin is not so tastety and was just not enough. In the afternoon they serve ordinary Chinese food and the taste was better. It's actually a very good place to hangout with a lot of friends cause all of people can order whatever they want, the amount of food is limited."}
{"text":"It's a cute little dim sum place in a small Asian shopping center. It's clean and bright. The service was quick and efficient. On days when it's crowded, the place could feel a little stuffy and hectic. 

 I came for lunchtime dim sum both times I was here. Prices are reasonable, but the bill adds up pretty quickly. Lots to choose from the dim sum carts and everything is quite tasty. The one dish that I would not recommend is their steamed clams. The clams were poorly prepared with pieces of shells everywhere. 

Overall, I recommend this place if you're in the area. Great for large groups! The dishes aren't spectacular, but they are delicious enough to inhale completely when you're in a hungry rage. Also, very good tea!"}
{"text":"Food was okay considering they're the biggest Cantonese restaurant serving dimsum in Cleveland downtown area. However I think their are getting sloppy with the quality in the food and the service. 

I am still in stock after seeing the on table  service continuing serving with the soup ladle which was bumpped off on to the carpet after wipping it off briefly on a cloth.

The \"sticky rice and chicken wrapped in the leaf\" (I don't know the name but if you ear dim sum you will know which dish I'm talking about) has half piece of a filthy chicken feather on the leaf...

I ordered the roasted duck dish as well. Half of the dish was duck fat with rarely meat on it. I called over a lady and trying give her some feedback. She told me I already eat half of the dish and it's too late as if I was about to ask her to server another dish which I didn't even plan to. 

First off, collecting feedback from customer is the most important thing of service delivery which can help your business to get successful. Second, in restaurant, if customer has legitimate reason to complain about the food or personally doesn't like it, the restaurant should take care of their customers and worry about their service instead of worrying if they're trying to take advantage of the restaurant over half of the silly duck dish. 

Highlight here, their manager took half of the dish price (4 dollar or something) off my bill and told me they didn't even roast the duck in their restaurant!!! So they're not responsible for the quality of this dish.........I almost laugh my ass off. 

I'll never ever go back to this place again and admitting this is a shame among the Chinese community. I've been so many places that have 100 times more humiliation than this place. I'm over this place now."}
{"text":"Had Saturday Dim Sum. Make sure to come early. There was a long line out the door after we were seated. The variety of the dim sum was good. There were some dishes that I never seen during dim sum. The main dishes were average size but fresh. Everything was hot, never warm or cold and service was fast. 

Be sure to ask for a freshly cooked taro root cake. The taro root cake was still good but if the cart is there intended to seer it tableside then it would be a nice to have it that way instead of the person picking one up from the side where it was already warmed. 

If I ever come back to Cleveland, hope I can come again. (I love Dim Sum)"}
{"text":"Located inside of Cleveland's best Asia Market is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Ohio. Now, I haven't really been to many outside of Ohio, so my judgement is made on that scale. My usual dish is the Wor Su Gai, AKA Almond Boneless Chicken. The portions are huge. I tend to come here on holidays as they're something that my friends and myself don't observe. Unlike many of the other reviewers, Dim Sum isn't a dish that excites me, so I have no opinion on the dim sum. I highly suggest visiting with a group and prepare to share. Also, don't get overzealous with the cart of goodies that gets pushed around the restaurant or your bill will rack up quickly."}
{"text":"Having recently moved from the Asian-saturated Irvine, CA to Cleveland, OH, I have started my quest for anything vaguely resembling the familiar Cantonese and other traditional comfort foods.  

After wandering down a rather sketchy looking area of town, we stumbled upon this plaza, where we followed the sound of clinking dishes to this dim sum restaurant.  To the right of the entrance is a display of roasted meats -- duck, chicken, pork -- and to the left was the cashier.  I asked the hostess if they offered take-out dim sum, and she handed me a menu with pictures and a piece of paper to write my order down.  We ordered the basics - har gow, siu mai, bok tong go, shrimp cheong fun - and a pound of char siu for good measure.  The hostess was quite helpful and friendly -- at least according to Asian standards.

The delicious aroma of the char siu pervaded the car as we drove from Cleveland back to Brecksville, and once at the house, popped open the styrofoam containers.  The har gow and siu mai were small, but the ingredients were fresh and not overly greasy.  The bok tong go was flatter and had less sponginess than I am accustomed to, but was still decent.  The cheong fun was pleasantly soft and filled with good sized shrimp.  The char siu was a little dry since it was fairly lean, but was also decent.

I'll probably go back to pick up more dim sum, and also to try the roast duck and roast pork."}
{"text":"A family favorite, my kids can't get enough of shu Mai. We've been coming here for over 25 years. Very authentic food and could be intimidating to less adventurous crowds. Best part is dim sum on Sunday's. A great way to try new dishes with the smaller portions."}
{"text":"This is the place to go in Cleveland to get your dim sum fix."}
{"text":"I love coming here on the weekends for dim sum with a group of friends. The food is always good and reasonably priced. One of my favorite places to eat in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Terrible dim sum.  Overpriced as well.  $9.50 for a over-cooked Chinese broccoli dish.  Roasted duck with neck and undesirable parts was put on the plate, should have never put on customer's plate.

Will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Dim sum here was pretty good, with all the staples being tasty, except for the \"shrimp in tofu\" dish. That tasted like vinegar. Unsure if this is how they make it or if the tofu is stale and fermented. Either way, the tofu wasn't fresh and definitely had been frozen & thawed & reheated. The other dishes tasted a little bit off from the dim sum I'm used to (NYC & Hong Kong). Though, again, unsure if this is how they do it in Cleveland. 

Otherwise, service was good and waiter was friendly. Strangely, our table was the only Asian people there. Maybe it was because we went on a Tuesday or maybe we chose the wrong dim sum place."}
{"text":"This is not authentic Chinese food. Ordered three dim sum dishes for 12.95 and the spicy fish. The flavor is okay but not what I expected. But the service is really great here."}
{"text":"I've written too much today -- and will update this review eventually.  4.5 stars.

This is, thus far, the best Canto-food I've had in CLE.  Wanton Gourmet is also quite authentic, but it's more \"working class\"... which I absolutely love.

Li Wah is a bit more upscale Canto food.  In NYC or the Bay or LA, this would get a 3 or so.  But so far, in CLE, it's rather high up.  :)

For the record, I know Eileen and Ryan who are Chinese from California.  I am Cantonese, and go to Hong Kong once to thrice a year for various reasons... including eating.   It's reasonably authentic, promise.  Oh, and Toronto, in 1995-2004, was the hands down best city for Dim Sum in North America.  A lot of those chefs have moved back to HK or retired now...  :("}
{"text":"Li Wah has been a part of Cleveland's Chinatown for a long time. They really do bring a good dim sum experience but I feel in years recent, they have been reheating frozen dim sum to sell instead of making it fresh. Now I know it is hard to make everything from scratch as it takes a lot of preparation. I do give them credit for trying to come up with more options. It is still good and I think they really try to please the customers with their service. I will still come back as it is a good place to connect with friends and ear dim sum."}
{"text":"Decent place for dim sum in Cleveland. Doesn't compare to the larger cities, but still pretty good. The only thing I really wish they'd improve on is the egg custard bun! Just wish it had a better outside crust. Decently sized portions for items not in the dim sum cart--not overwhelmingly big. Will be back. Hopefully they come up with more choices for dim sum in the meantime."}
{"text":"Never ever again. After my meal I went to the mens room where I witnessed a man in a white kitchen apron walk out of the stall and straight out of the restroom. He didn't even glance at the sink to wash his hands. He was too busy texting on his phone. I could not possibly be more disgusted."}
{"text":"Why is dim sum so freakin delicious? It's seriously better than brunch (sorry brunch lovers)! Coming from LA, where there is literally a dim sum restaurant at every corner, I didn't expect Cleveland to even have dim sum. But I'm pleasantly surprised by Li Wah! It has fairly authentic dim sum, with fast and friendly service. If you're new to the whole dim sum scene, I suggest starting off with some BBQ pork buns, shrimp dumplings, pork shumai and red bean buns. But if you're a hardcore dim sum-er like myself, you must try the fried steamed chicken feet and steamed ribs! 

The only complaint I have for Li Wah is that it lacks the wide selection of dim sum items I'm used to back in LA. I wish they had rolled rice noodles, leek dumplings, and taro cakes :("}
{"text":"Good variety of dim sum, not too expensive.  It's pretty standard dim sum dishes - definitely hits the spot when you are in the mood."}
{"text":"Good spot for dim sum. Two of us came in on a Saturday around 12:30p and had to wait about 7 minutes, not bad at all. Fast and friendly service.  I am from NYC (now in Cleveland) and was overall happy with the food (quality, taste, selection) and experience."}
{"text":"Lunchtime dim sum is best you will find in Cleveland (which, I realize, isn't saying much). But the dinner menu is very forgettable standard Chinese fare. Sauces are heavy and bland, beef and chicken is of very average quality. There are much better options within blocks of this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum, good enough substitute for La. But their food is really greasy not as flavorful that way when all you eat is grease. I do enjoy their chicken lotus wraps I do miss those a lot. We do go every few weeks because we do need our daily dose of asian food...yum"}
{"text":"The best thing about Li Wah was the food it was great. Service was good."}
{"text":"Dim sum game be strong! Not bad Cleveland.. I'm impressed. I tried the shumai, spare ribs, BBQ pork buns, egg tarts, and the salted shrimp. While the shrimp was a meh, the other dishes were surprisingly quite good! (I'm comparing this to good o'l weekend dim sum in MingHin Chicago) I stopped by on a Saturday morning and the restaurant was PACKEDD, we were lucky to find a corner table! I was expecting a decent wait but the carts were quickly stocked and kitchen seemed to be at its A-game *thumbs up* Last but not least.... They had Xiao Long Bao aka Soup Dumplings!!!! *drool* And they were deliciouss *cry* Overall, great experience! Still not up to the level you get at bigger cities but this is a great start for the land."}
{"text":"I had dim sum at Li Wah on 11-23-16.  I got there around noon and the place was very busy but not too terribly noisy.  Dim sum are delicious, service is prompt and prices are moderate.  I also ordered vegetable lo mein, which was served with green peppers, snow peas, mushrooms, water chestnuts, onions, baby corn and a bit of bok choy.  The green peppers, for my taste, should not have been added to this dish as they are overpowering.  Tea is flavorful but could have been a bit stronger.  Pot stickers are really delicious.  Parking can be tricky but if you circle around you will find a spot.  Li Wah is adequately staffed and it looks and feels very clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"Is this Cleveland right now? But really- I thought CLE was all about beer and polish food. Not today my friends! 

If you're looking for an experience, look no further than Li Wah on a Sunday for some tasty, Asian vittles. Dim sum FTW. Chicken feet? Got that. Taro patty? Got that. Peking duck bun? Got that too. 

The price is right. The food is pretty ok. Some dishes were super tasty, like the sticky rice and meat wrapped in a banana leaf, while other dishes were just alright, like the roasted duck. Quick service. Free hot tea. Cool ambiance. 

All in all, I feel like this Cleveland brunch spot is a staple and should not be overlooked.  I'll be back, Li Wah, and next time, I'm going to bring my friend who speaks Chinese so the cart ladies can answer all my questions  (\"what's in that bun?\")"}
{"text":"i ate at Li Wah Restaurant during the 7th Annual Asian Festival. I ordered mixed vegetables: broccoli, onions, carrots.  I also ordered Fried Rice and it was average. I ordered 2 chicken egg rolls and they were crispy and good. The service was good and the server was knowledgeable of the a la carte dishes."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place for dimsum food. You get dishes instantly and they are all absolutely delicious. Cheap too."}
{"text":"First of all, this place is in relatively ignored location that is the tremendous void between University Circle and downtown Cleveland.  Don't let the location scare you.  It's actually pretty decent and has great highway access.  I left my sleepy suburb and ventured out to try this place with some friends and I was not at all disappointed.  

If you're a fan of Chinese food this place has got to be heaven.  The Dim Sum is terrific.  While I don't eat meat, my friends who do all loved it.  The few items I did get to try including the vegetable spring rolls and veggies were absolutely incredible.  I ordered from the menu and ended up getting Buddha's feast, which was excellent.  The food was hot, fresh, and incredibly tasty.  Prices are fair and the restaurant is actually quite nice.

The service for our large group of 9 was somewhat slow as we had to find a waiter to get us water, or even take our orders from the menu.  The carts of food also rolled around somewhat infrequently.  On the flip side, it was convenient being able to just drop in on a Saturday for lunch and have a table for our large group without having made reservations.  This restaurant is definitely unique among Chinese restaurants in Cleveland and I would highly recommend it if you haven't been."}
{"text":"We normally drive here from Columbus to eat Dim Sum and Dinner. It's located in a Chinese shopping plaza... but the plaza is pretty quiet and small. The service is pretty good and fast. The Dim Sum is probably one of the best in Ohio... unless you compare to NY, LA, SF or Vancouver. But hey unless you are crazy like me and drive to Toronto, this is not a bad place at all.

Their Har Gaow, shu mai, chicken feet, ribs with black bean,and beef tripe is very tasty. 

Prices are not too expensive either. We usually eat Dim Sum around 1pm here then Dinner around 4-5 here. Hmm yea.. well... we're like the bottomless pit."}
{"text":"I am giving this place four stars conditionally.  If it were in Monterey Park or San Francisco I'd be much harsher, but in Cleveland its downright gourmet Chinese food.

The dim sum is pretty good, served on the push carts by surly Asian ladies.  I have yet to eat from their lunch or dinner menu, but I imagine the dishes would be respectable.  

The best Chinese food in Cleveland hands down."}
{"text":"I was visiting my friends who just moved to Cleveland (actually Westlake which is lovely) and they took us to Li Wah. My friend is Chinese so when she said this was the only decent place for dim sum that she has found, I knew it would be good. 
Now some of their selections are authentic Chinese, like the tripe, chicken feet, and I forgot the rest, but I'm not that into those items. The variety of dumplings were really good and they had Chinese Broccoli that was perfectly done (not fainting in the dish with a whole bunch of oyster sauce). They had Mexican doughnuts  (yes, that's what they are called) which is one of my favorite desserts when I have dim sum. It was all great. 
The table next to me had a plate of HUGE crab legs that looked delicious but I kept myself under control. 
So if you are in Cleveland visit Li Wah's."}
{"text":"They're only good for the Dim Sum. Which is usually always packed on Sunday's. Cute little Asian ladies pushing the carts but it is kinda pricey."}
{"text":"Great dim sum, one of the few places in town for an authentic Chinese meal. Needs some work on cleanliness, bathrooms are quite dirty."}
{"text":"if you coming on weekdays,there is only a few choices for the dim sum. The food tastes not too bad,the reason why I give this place 2 star is about the service. The waiter is kind of  stubborn, he took us to a window seat which has 2 chairs in there. I asked him I would like to move to the table which has 4 chairs that I could put my bag in the chair. He keep telling me \"don't you think the window seat is perfect? You could put your bag in the windowsill,it's perfect.\" Even there were plenty empty tables,even there was a single men sit in the big table,the waiter seems not happy to let us move to a bigger table. Can't understand. Not feel comfortable during my meal."}
{"text":"Well, times change and they certainly  have at Li Wah! What I remembered  as the crown jewel  of Asia Plaza is now a dirty and overrated  dump. I stopped for a late lunch last  week and was greeted by a crowd of \"employees \" at the door, none of which seemed  to know what to do next.. ( show me to a table) One person took the order  then another one tried to take my  order like they were jockeying  for the table.. Szechaun Shrimp was bland and fried rice ( which is extra) was tasteless and greasy. The dumplings  I ordered came out 10 min. after the shrimp then I was asked if I would like a box for them? No, actually  I'm going to try them while they are hot... What? Now she's  trying to rush me out the door? I'm  pretty  sure they don't  close between lunch and dinner, so I don't  know what the big hurry  is!! In total, I was there for 30 min. Never again! I should have continued  down the street  to Superior  Pho where I originally  planned to go."}
{"text":"Been here for years since I was a little kid. I never really written a review until I started a yelp page but this place rocks. Compared to other dim sum places I've been to like Toronto and California, this place isn't that bad for Midwest Cleveland. 

They have dim sum on weekends from 10am-3pm and it's best to arrive early since the place can fill out fast. Food is charged based on how large or small the plate is. 

My most recent visit we ordered at most all large plates which were $3 each and the smalls are like $2.50. I went with my family for Labor Day weekend and there were 5 of us. We ordered the shrimp noodle, shu-Mai, ha gow, tripe, spicy chicken feet, and seafood lo mein. Everything tasted delicious and I can't forget about their egg tarts. The only downside is that they add lots of msg to their food so make sure you drink lots of water!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad for Dim Sum in Cleveland"}
{"text":"I really did not like the food here."}
{"text":"It's a halfway decent dim sum spot (can't be too choosy as there aren't too many options around anyways), but I'm mostly a fan of Li Wah's dinner menu. The fact that it really reminds me of Chinese dining halls back on the West Coast helps for sure. They have a variety of traditional dishes that my parents would even be satisfied eating, as well as other dishes that cater towards more Western palates. You'll do best by bringing someone familiar with ethnic Chinese food or who can speak the language to get the best service and best recommendations. Would recommend the Peking Duck (with the buns) and Japanese Tofu. Don't forget the Chrysanthemum Tea (if you like herbal teas, that is)! Treat your servers well, and they'll take care of you. 

It's perfect for both big groups, families, or a friendly outing. There's even a sectioned-off banquet room for really large parties. The prices are higher than other Chinese places around, but nothing outrageous. Parking can be found in front of the store, around the side, or on a really busy day, in the Park To Shop lot (walk through the indoor shopping mall)."}
{"text":"Nested in a little shopping mall of sorts, I was pleasantly surprised that this dim sum place was open so late (we arrived close to midnight on the way back from Cedar Point). Ordered a couple dim sum dishes since the carts obviously were not out and about this late at night and as such, there was no one in the restaurant other than us. Surprised how quickly the order came as most dim sum places I've been to before tend to struggle with made-to-order outside of dim sum cart hours. I will say that the dim sum here is pretty good, not the best I've had, but definitely good enough to be considered relatively authentic. Dumplings, eggplant, shu mai, you name it, there's a decent list of dim sum options, at least from what I can remember when taking a cursory look at the menu. Would definitely come here the next time I'm in the area, although I certainly would be open to trying some of the others that local folk have said are good, too. As it's in a small shopping area, parking tends to be limited so do keep that in mind when coming during weekends, when it tends to be more busy."}
{"text":"This place was highly rated, however we ordered Cilantro Shrimp Dumplings, Pork Buns, and Shanghai Pork Dumplings and all were very plain and had zero taste. They actually without asking substituted the cilantro shrimp dumpling for a plain shrimp dumpling. I sent it back and he just said they were out of cilantro. Really? All pork is just sausage with no taste and under cooked. Every single thing that came out was bad. I'm not sure how this place gets a good rating."}
{"text":"I noticed that there are a lot of references to the Dim Sum here. Unfortunately I came here for an event and didn't get a chance to get the authentic \"Dim Sum\" experience here. We got a buffet specially for the event I was attending. Only dim sum dishes I got to try were the har gow, shumai and the steamed buns. I think the har gow and shumai were decent and the steamed buns were dry. 

The other dishes we tried included noodles, cream cheese wontons, sesame chicken and something else I can't remember. I wasn't too impressed but to be fair I should come for a regular meal."}
{"text":"ok ok, haven't yet gone here for Dim Sum, but it's on my to-do list!

Had some strange craving for Chinese food this week and decided to gram some take-out after class and give Li Wah a try.  Wound up getting crab meat rangoon, steamed pot stickers, the house special pan fried noodles and honey black pepper beef...and fortune cookies (don't judge, I know they're not traditional Chinese, but I'm not either and i LIKE them!).

After I called with my order they said 20 min, so great stuff on the timing!

Now, I'm comparing to NYC China Town, Vancouver and San Fran for quality of the food because those have been my main Chinese food experiences

Pot Stickers - passable, a little lackluster in flavor, definitely needed the sauce that goes with them

Crab Meat Rangoon - seriously lacking in the filling department, basically just big things of fried dough

House Special Pan fried noodles with ?Chicken? - I ordered the chicken because when I go the first time to a Chinese restaurant I don't usually order the seafood....but, it smelled very fishy when we opened it, and yep, sure enough, shrimp and taco.  It was good (probably my favorite of the bunch) but not what I ordered.

Honey Black Peppered Beef - I usually order beef & Broccoli, but after reading a few reviews, this dish seemed to be a big hit.  It was pretty good and I would definitely order it again even though it has asparagus in it and I've got that stupid gene....too much?  ;o)

Fortune cookies - uh, where were these from?  The \"Depressing and Pessimistic Fortune Cookie Co.\"?  Cookies were fine, but the inserts weren't fun at all....where are the cute little \"Confucius says\" ones?

So, all in all, an ok experience....especially since I'm the person that if I had to pick one Asian cuisine to eat for the rest of my life it would be Indian and most definitely not Chinese, heck, it wouldn't even make my top 5 of Asian cuisines.  I would still like to try Dim Sum some time here as I love those little steamed buns!"}
{"text":"Weekday Lunch Review

2 carts of Dim Sum... very slow... did not circle at all unless a waiter told them to come around. Quality matched the pictures already posted... even though the selection did not.  We were able to ask for items not on the 2 carts and they came promptly.

No tea menu... plain or nothing.

What they did have was really good.  Nice balance on spices.

Chewy rice noodles with nice ginger beef filling, flavorful bao, and filled a take out order promptly so we could take some home to my mom.

Peking duck and ribs by the slab available at a station just inside the door as well as live lobster and bass.

4 stars for quality... would get take out next time and not try and eat in."}
{"text":"This has got to be my favorite dim sum restaurant in Cleveland. I've had dim sum all over the country, and for being a little restaurant just outside of Cleveland, I love this place. The dim sum is authentic, the prices are comparable to what you would pay in chinatown NYC, the service is decent. They have the carts come out on weekends, but they offer a selection of dim sum from the kitchen every single day.
I highly recommend this restaurant. Anytime I'm in the Cleveland area for work, I stop in here, have some dim sum and hot tea and pick up some take out for home.
Recommendations: try the roast pork and the roast duck. Also, the chive dumplings are probably my favorite."}
{"text":"We eat here all of the time. Very good food and great service. My stepchildren don't live far from here so it's convenient and good"}
{"text":"Li Wah is definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in town. Service is always quick. Its not your typical greasy tasteless Chinese. They have a pretty decent menu selections. Prices are very reasonable and they are open LATE which is a plus for someone like me. They also offer a number of dim sum items. The restaurant is huge and can easily accommodate parties from 2-20."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying WOW! We did not intend to try Li Wah at all we actually intended on trying thai thai in Lakewood how ever after driving out to Lakewood from Willoughby I found out they are closed. Their website stated they opened today at 11:30 I'm not happy about that but any ways back to my review. We sat on a side street thinking about where we should go. We all decided to go to our go to place which is superior pho. Upon arriving at superior pho we decided we need to try different places. I have been eyeing Li Wah on yelp for some time so I threw up the idea and my father and sisters boyfriend decided it was a good idea. We got here around 2:30 in the afternoon later then their lunch crowd. We got seated fast but it did take sometime before someone came over for our order to be honest there was only like 3 other tables most workers kept walking around. We decided to order only dim sum dishes as that is what they are known for. My father and I got the same thing. We got a soup dumpling , a rice noodle roll with minced beef, bbq pork buns and another kind of dumpling. I enjoyed it all only thing I do not think I will order again is the bbq pork buns. I felt they were to sweet and would prefer a more savory item. They gave use a brown dipping sauce which I think was some sort of possible oyster sauce. We also got a red vinegarish type of sauce for our soup dumplings that I honestly did not think was good. On the table they have a very tasty hot chili oil. Not super spicy but actually seasoned well with oil and soy sauce I enjoyed dipping my dumplings into the hot oil. After we finished our food we got on the subject of bizarre foods and how he eats chicken feet. We noticed they had chicken feet on the menu so we decided to order one of them to try it out. To be honest I thought I would choke on a chicken nail haha but it was in this very tasty black bean sauce. there was not much to it other then sucking off the skin and chewing on some tendons. I enjoyed it but don't see the point of ordering it again. The whole table absolutely enjoyed  the soup dumplings our server was a younger guy and mentioned to us they would take a little bit of time to come out. I guess they only make so many dumplings and when they run out that's it. How ever he was super nice and went in the back and made our 2 orders from scratch that right there is why we left a nice tip  :). After we finished the server was friendly and we had a little discussion about how we enjoyed the food he told us how dim sum restaurants work in Chicago and nyc. He mentioned to us a few times it's best to come on a Saturday or Sunday right at 11 to experience the dim sum steam carts being pushed around and that they have A LOT more items to choose from and things are continuously coming out from the back. I also liked the rice noodle roll. If you can get past the texture of the noodle which does not bother me it's a great little dish flavorful in a soy sauce liquid cut it up and dip it in hot chili oil omg heaven. I recommend people stop here and try their food. Next time I might look at their whole menu and try to order some things that aren't to Americanized. I know Li Wah will be another go to place for us. All three of us ate for about $35. We just split the bill 3 ways so it was roughly $12 and that's not bad for lunch. I did tell my self once the food was out that it did not look like a lot of food but once I ate it all I sure was stuffed. A complete 5 star looking forward to a weekend visit to get the full dining experience,"}
{"text":"Little Bites of Chinese goodness

A Chinese friend of mine first took me to Li Wah for Dim Sum. I was slightly frightened when I first went into the shopping plaza it is in. The plaza itself is fairly run down and slightly frightening but I decided to grin and bear it and I am very glad I did. The moment you walk in the restaurant you nearly forget you are in a run down shopping center in Cleveland. The service is fast and courteous even when the restaurant is busy.  For Dim sum a group of ladies push around carts some with fried dumplings others with sweet dessert rolls and another with steamed fare. On a side note some of the servers pushing the carts do not speak very good english so you may end up ordering a couple things you are not sure what is in them. Their selection ranges from the very traditional tripe or chickens feet to the american favorites like pork barbecue buns. 

Li Wah for dinner is also a treat especially going in a large group it gives you the ability to order a lot of different dishes and they will be served pseudo family style so that you can try a little bit of everything. I have yet to try anything on their menu that was anything less than a culinary experience. 

What I recommend:
Lotus wrapped sticky rice
Sesame buns
Roast peking duck 
Salt fried squid
Turnip cakes (to die for)
Some other little bites that sadly I do not know what they were.
General Tso's Chicken 

Hit or Miss
Some of the entrees are a little americanized and a little gloppy.
Soft shell crabs (all i'm saying is don't order them when they are out of season)

Avoid like the Plague
The bathrooms (your favorite watering hole has better toilets)

Overall:
Go try it. Even if you don't like one thing there are 20 more to try. Go in a group, order a bunch of different things, be adventurous, eat a lot (trust me you will), and enjoy the variety if nothing else."}
{"text":"You'll find your usual dim sum staples but with some extras like sauteed mussels, roasted crispy skin pork, and jelly fish salad. Everything was delicious and fresh. The only bad thing was the parking lot gets full quickly but you have the options of parking on the street. Also there are pan handlers out front so beware."}
{"text":"Have gone here with a group of people several times - always good, always plenty of food, always fun! The menu is quiet extensive so don't come here unless you are hungry and planning on doing real damage ;-) Probably one of the best Dim Sum places in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Li Wah is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Cleveland!!!   Every time I come here I get the chicken fried rice or some other delicious dish that never disappoints. Definitely check this place out when you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Always super fast pick up orders. I usually have simple orders. Delicious food all around. I've eaten inside before. Interior is okay. Its all about the food."}
{"text":"The best Authentic Chinese food around!! I'm from San Francisco and the food here securely lives up to the food in China Town! No Crappy Americanized take out here,and they have a Dim Sum!!! When I want to gert a taste of home I come to Li Wah and find complete happiness! Also, check out the grocery store in the plaza, AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Li Wah is an authentic Chinese restaurant along with Bo Loong and Siam Cafe located at the heart of Asia town in Cleveland. As you sit here, do realize that there are two menus -- the American-Chinese menu a.k.a. the solo menu for \"westerners\" accustomed to having one meal all for themselves OR the authentic Chinese menu, a.k.a. the group menu which features several large dishes meant to be shared.

In the group menu, I'd go for steamed whole grouper, yang chow fried rice, salt-baked fish fillet or pork. If in a larger group, one could also order a set course menu of several courses. Again, all served in the middle of the table, meant to be shared.

If you're here for dimsum, order things like the pork shumai, shrimp dumpling, pork spareribs, steamed pork buns, or chicken feet if you're up for it.

If you're clueless or actually appear clueless, they'll give you the American menu so that you can enjoy your General Tso chicken, whoever he is."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dim sum served at Li Wah.  Stand out dishes were all the dumplings. Pork and shrimp were my favorite. The shrimp or beef wrapped in rice noodle was also quite good.  These dishes weren't dripping in grease, a major plus in my book.  

Sticky rice, pork buns are all pretty standard and good.  This place is pretty cheap. About $10-20 a person depending on the size of your appetite.  

The variety and number of carts is lacking given the size of the restaurant, but at least it gives you plenty of time to chat and build up your appetite in between dishes.  I also wish that the dishes came out hotter.  They all seemed more or less luke warm. That's okay though, I'm just glad there is a decent place in Cleveland to get my dim sum fix."}
{"text":"Growing up in Cleveland, Li Wah is one of the best restaurants with tasty dim sum. In bigger cities, such as Los Angelos and Manhattan, there are obviously more varieties in appetizers, main dishes and desserts, however with the small Chinese population in Cleveland, I would say we are pretty lucky to have Li Wah around! 

I have been going here since I was a kid for brunch, dinner, and even wedding receptions. We come as a family or bring friends from out of town to this dining location. The food is phenomenal, and to this day, I love introducing friends and coworkers to share a bit of my culture through food! 

Be warned that a majority of the dim sum dishes are composed of pork or shrimp or a combination of the two. If you decide to go with the dim sum option, it is best if you come with a Chinese speaking friend so you don't order anything surprising! Most dim sum dishes are for sharing, so don't be upset if your friend takes a dumpling of \"yours.\" My favorite (and all the kids' favorite) dim sum dish are the Siu Mai, which are the pork and shrimp dumplings. If you order straight from the menu, food choices are pretty straight forward and if you need some explanation, most of the servers are able to explain to you in English. My favorite from the menu options is the Pan Fried Noodle with Seafood dish. Thinking about it is just making my mouth water... yum! 

Dim sum runs from 10 am - 3 pm on weekdays (with limited options) and 10 am - 4 pm on weekends. Menu items can be ordered throughout the day. 

I highly recommend Li Wah for authentic Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and they have the standard traditional dim sum dishes that I appreciate.  They also have more modern takes on dim sum that I appreciate as well (a bit healthier).  As we finished up our dim sum lunch, we ordered a few dishes to take home for dinner.  Usually service is fine, but this time we our takeout order took FOREVER (like over 20 minutes, which is ridiculously long for Chinese stir fry which usually takes 5).  We asked a few times to check on the order as we really thought they had forgotten it.  There must have been some issue in the kitchen because the lunch crowd was already over at that time."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of dim sum, this is the place to be. This is one of the few places in Cleveland that serves this Cantonese food, but this is the best place by far compared to the other ones.

On weekends, the place is usually packed with Asians from all over the greater Cleveland area. However, seating is usually not a problem as this is a fairly large restaurant. 

Their dim sum selection features over 40+ items, ranging from the usual shrimp dumplings (har gow), pork dumping (siu mai), congee, to beef tendons and chicken feet (you should definitely try this, its tastier than it sounds!). The dim sum is served from carts that are pushed around the restaurant. Each cart has a different selection of dim sum dishes. You stop a cart and you make your selection. The dishes are tallied on the check. The dim sum is fresh and is made daily, but selection and freshness is definitely better on the weekends since its busier and more batches are made. My favorite dim sum dishes include the shrimp and pork dumplings, pork & egg congee, chicken feet, beef tendons, stuff eggplants, shrimp rice crepes,  and to finish off with egg tart custards and/or sweet soy bean pudding.

During dim sum, you don't really have a dedicated server. You can flag down any one of the servers to get what you want. Some server's are better with English than others, so communications can be an issue for non Chinese speakers. However, they do have a menu featuring pictures of the dim sum dishes which you can select and will be brought to your table.

My only advice for first time dim sum goers is to be open minded and try what smells and looks good!"}
{"text":"As far as Cleveland dim sum goes, Li Wah's is the best.

Compared to Seattle? It's decent.

The sesame balls, char siu bao, and siu mai are the best things there. And the chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. I will eat an entire plate of that all on my own. 

I LOVE tripe....but theirs is not good. And I adore chicken feet, also not good there.

It seems like no matter how much I order or how many people I bring, the bill is always around $60. My sister and I can go....$60. My entire family of 5 can go....$60.

Parking can be a bit of a mess on busy days (I parked down the side street during the Chinese New Year festival), but most days I seem to manage to always get princess parking."}
{"text":"OK quality dim sum here, and with cart service.   It was crowded for weekday lunch and we noticed a lot of business folks come into Chinatown for lunch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in to grab a late dinner around 11:30pm because they were about the only thing open. The food we received was horrible! We both ordered general zso's chicken. I got fried rice which was $1.50 extra. First mistake. The rice was NOT cooked. I could keep going on about how terrible this $25 late night Chinese run was but I'll just end it by saying I will never be going to Li Wah's again and I advise anyone else to do the same."}
{"text":"I WILL NOT EAT HERE AGAIN... Ordered: spring rolls - full of chestnuts and no other veggies, shrimp wonton - broth was so bland and without flavor, and sesame shrimp - horrible like the shrimp was taken from frozen shrimp cocktail and cooked it that sauce very gross!!! The only decent food I received was the white rice."}
{"text":"Li Wah is the place to go for dim sum in the CLE! One clear indication of this is the packed dining room on weekend afternoons. It's like the entire Cleveland Asian community had made previous plans to congregate here every single weekend.

Of course, that's partly due to the skilled chefs at Li Wah. This place prides itself on having one of the most extensive dim sum menus in Ohio, and with 30+ items to choose from, I can see why out-of-towners consider this their one-stop destination for \"Chinese tapas.\" 

Standout items include:
-Mexican buns
-Clams with black bean sauce
-Shrimp stuffed fried bean curd
-Hargow

My one small gripe about Li Wah is sometimes the pastry chef goes MIA on the weekends. The last time I checked in for dim sum, they weren't serving preserved egg pastries nor the baked bbq puff pastries -- two items I MUST get anytime I see them listed on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food! I went here recently for a business lunch and although they were pretty busy, there was plenty of room to, we were seated immediately, and the service was fast. I think because they do get so busy they like to keep things fast paced which made the server seem a little short, which is my only complaint. They were very nice but just not super patient. The food came out fast for our table of 6. I ordered the chicken and shrimp pad thai, you get soup with your combo meal so I ordered the wonton soup, and lastly an eggroll. The portions are huge! The soup came out fast, it was only one wonton but still very good. Our client ordered a large wonton soup for her meal that was a large portion with tons of wontons. Overall, the soup was good. My pad thai had a limited amount of chicken but a good amount of shrimp and a ton of noodles. It tasted delicious and I had enough for lunch the next day. The eggroll I had was piping hot and tasted amazing.

The prices are fairly cheap. I would love to try the dimsum sometime. There is plenty of parking outside. The interior is old and a little dated but still cute and comfortable. 

Overall, great experience I highly reccomend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely no desire to return to a place that has shark fin soup on the menu. Very, very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a Sunday Bruch favorite.
Though the Dim Sum isn't very traditional, there are nods to tradition for those who perfer it. I am a creature of habit and get the same 5 items;  pork shu mai (spelling?), steamed pork buns, fried rice in the bowl, sesame balls, and custards. My husband is all over the menu; chicken feet, tripe, and jellyfish.
Delish"}
{"text":"Chinese New Year's was an exciting and unexpected event that occurred while we were there with its dancing dragons and drums. What was not exciting was the smaller portions we got because of it and the mandatory %20 tip we had to pay for less than prompt service. I ordered clams in black bean sauce and when it arrived I knew I would have to eat some of my companions food to be full. What was really disappointing were all the rocks and pebbles in the clam sauce. I could not eat the rice they put on my plate. This was a potentially dangerous meal. Sadly and unlike my previous visits, everyone ate everything on their plates. This was impossible my last  two times there. I hope they are better when they are less busy; when the new year is over. Maybe I'll come back and try it, but I am just not sure."}
{"text":"Very good Cantonese-style Chinese food.  I've eaten here a large number of times, and I've had both the dim-sum (served during lunch) and the regular entrees for dinner.  The food here is very different from the sort of Americanized Chinese food available at most places, and the quality is consistently high.

There is no sense in naming specifics because (a) i'm not sure what half the stuff is, and (b) it all tastes really good.  I love the way they use Chinese broccoli instead of American broccoli, and use a variety of different kinds of mushrooms instead of the bland button mushrooms, etc.  I've had good experiences with the dim-sum, the regular entrees, the large soups to share with people, and also with the casserole-style dishes (something that is not available in most Chinese restaurants in America).

The atmosphere is nice too--it's a big fairly open room, casual but still a little classy.  This place is among the best place to bring large groups: you can get a large round table or two that has a spinny-thing in the center to make sharing easy.  They also have serve alcohol at very reasonable prices.  You can't go wrong with this place; I've had significantly worse food in both New York's and Philadelphia's Chinatown; this place could easily hold its own in either of those locations, although San-Fransisco might give it a run for its money."}
{"text":"Took three things from the dim sum cart. Deep fried taro with pork inside looked uncooked - was gooey and pink-ish. And cold! Stuffed tofu skin rolls looked good on top, but the bottom was dark and dried to a leathery texture. Rice noodles with beef had an odd smell and the beef was pureed smooth like \"pink slime.\" 

Had I eaten the rest I would have been disappointed by small portions. But I only had a bit of each of the three. Yuck. Yuck. And yuck."}
{"text":"Ok, before people yak and moan about how the dim sum here is \"mediocre compared to NYC/LA/China\"...no kidding.  Its Cleveland.  And I've had Dim Sum in NYC, SF, and Hong Kong, and ya know, for what it is, its actually pretty decent.  I like it.

The reason for the 2 stars off is because of the horrific service.  Seriously? People call this service? I get no-frills...I even get the attitude sometimes...but the blatant impatience and rudeness of the servers is awful.  If you take 2 secs longer to decide what you want from the cart...the woman starts to roll her eyes, any longer, and she'll just push the cart by you.
Some kid waved some kind of eggplant in front of us and we asked \"What's in this\" and he seriously looked at us and said \"um...eggplant?\"

NO KIDDING!?!? EGGPLANT!?!?! REALLY!?!? I WOULDN'T HAVE GUESSED.  What about the other stuff thats in it. 

No idea.

Yea, come here if you want decent dimsum, as long as you are perfectly happy being treated like an nuisance than a customer"}
{"text":"I can't add much other than this place was a great experience. In my brief time in Cleveland, I have been really glad to find some of the cultural variety that I have found elsewhere. I thought everything was on par with the few times I've tried dim sum in the past. 

Overall, I thought the restaurant was clean, the service was on top of everything, and the prices for dim sum were low. The servers come around with carts filled with steamed pork, seafood, or tofu pastries and there are some other things on the menu that I didn't see being carted around. I laughed as they tried to unload everything onto the table, so be sure to let them know when enough is enough! I'm really looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon. The place was bustling with people. We were seated fairly quickly and as soon as we sat down the carts started bringing their food. Dim-sums brought to you in carts have their own charm and greatly add to the experience. 

The service: They gave us menus which had pictures of all the dim sums that were being served. This actually really helped to choose what you want or ask for something you like. All the little Asian ladies with their carts were really nice and helpful bringing food I asked for even though it wasn't on their particular cart. 

The food: Definitely exceeded my expectations. I had been told it's not as good as Dim Sum in Toronto or Chicago, but I actually thought it was comparable. 

Overall: I will certainly come back. I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes dim sums as well as to those who are looking to try it for the first time and are looking for an authentic experience."}
{"text":"Dim Sum isn't very good and there are not any Cantonese friends I have that are regulars here. It's very large so it's good for groups."}
{"text":"Great food, service was ok, took long time to get someone to take my order,
Very nice menu, dim sum great, very Chinese, plenty of selection, go here and enjoy authentic Chinese. Very nice."}
{"text":"Li Wah is definitely the most popular place to go for dim sum in Cleveland.  This isn't to say that the food is amazing, but overall, Li Wah is a pretty solid choice.  When I go, I usually get the siumai (the dim sum staple pork dumplings), cha siu bau (steamed pork buns), sticky rice wrapped in leaves, chicken feet, tripe, the shrimp wrapped in long noodles, and usually some other miscellaneous items like vegetable dumplings or some kind of custard-filled item.  One thing I wish they had that I've seen elsewhere is Chinese sausage in a bun or wrapped like pigs-in-a-blanket.  

Of course, one of the best features of dim sum (anywhere, really) is that you can get all this food at a very affordable price.  Li Wah offers dim sum seven days a week, but the experience is much fuller at lunchtime on Saturdays and Sundays, when the restaurant is bustling and there are many more carts and food choices available.  Yes, many of the servers don't fully speak English (this, it seems, is dim sum tradition) but they're always happy to go through and show you all the different items they have in their cart."}
{"text":"I am very much in line with the 3.5 star review given by Yelp users.  I have found Li Wah to be inconsistent, ranging from mediocre to good.

I recently visited Li Wah and encountered some familiar themes.  For one, the service can be painstakingly slow, especially when it comes to bar service.  We waited at least five minutes for our server to arrive after being seated, and once we placed our drink order, it was at least ten minutes before they arrived.  Mind you, the restaurant was only one-third full.  We ordered our next round well in advance to ensure it arrived in a timely fashion.

As for the food, it was surprisingly good.  My group ordered the Pu Pu platter (so very adventurous of us, I know), and everything was solid.  I made my Kung Po chicken a complete dinner, and the hot and sour soup was serviceable.  The egg rolls were tasty, although the BBQ rib that accompanies the egg roll needed some work.  The Kung Po was about right, although it was a little veggie-heavy, which I considered a cheap, cost-cutting measure.  The rest of my party was satisfied with their meals, as well.

Looks like Li Wah has earned a return visit."}
{"text":"The three stars are probably more for myself than for the quality of the restaurant or its food.  To be honest, we stopped here for lunch while in the midst of a training downtown, not knowing anything other than that it served Chinese food.  I'm unfamiliar with Dim Sum, to be my own detriment, and plan to return here at some point to branch out - the Pad Thai was tasty, however.  Pretty standard layout and decoration, with well-presented food and reasonable pricing.  Service was standard (as in fulfilling the basic needs), but a manager of sorts did check in with us from time to time politely.  All in all, a pleasant experience, and one I plan to try again (this time adventuring out into the Dim Sum world)."}

{"text":"Wowah Li Wah! This was conveniently located pretty close to down town Cleveland. Friends have been saying for awhile to check out Li Wah when you get a chance and finally had a chance to during my visit. 

We tried to stop over Saturday during New Years holiday which was a big NO. We showed up about 12 PM and the line was way too long. It was nice seeing the lion dance in the Asia plaza but we had to bail. We tried again Sunday at 10:30 and there was not even a wait. We were seated quickly but it took awhile to get drinks ordered. It's what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant with the service.

We came for the dim sum and that is exactly what we got. Between 3 people we felt like there was an endless amount of dishes we picked out. My favorite was the soup dumplings which we waited to see if they were going to bring around in a cart but found out it is something to ask your server as they make it fresh in the back. Definitely recommend!

We had the typical dishes, shu-mai, pot stickers, congee soup, steamed pork ribs, turnip cake, shrimp noodle rolls, beef tripe, and wood ear mushroom salad. I'm a huge fan of turnip cake and they were definitely up there but everything else was pretty average.

Definitely worth visiting while you're in the area, dim sum options were nice, plenty of space, lines can be long, service was as expected and the food was just okay for me except the turnip cake and soup dumplings!"}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this restaurant often for dim sum ( over 15 years) and always had a positive experience. This all changed today. My son had bit into a shu mai piece and inside was a long thin piece of metal. It looked like a piece of a stainless steel scrubber you use to clean pots and pans with. I called a waiter over and he quickly disposed of it before the manager came over. I began explaining to the female manager what happened and the waiter came back to tell her what happened. I assume this because they did not speak English. All she asked why we disposed the item. To which I said your waiter took it before we could do anything!! WTF we do not make up shit like this! So all she did was apologize and asked if my son was okay. I'm very upset about how this was handled. As if it was not a big deal and suspected we were lying! My son almost threw up when he pulled it out of his food! I don't know if I'll ever go back again after this incident. We were not looking for a free meal or discount but to be treated better. In all fairness she did ask if she can switch out any dishes and at that point I said no because we just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"Every time I have gone to Li Wah I have been supremely satisfied with the offerings.  Their selection of dishes is quite good and the prices are not bad at all.  I am a long time fan of dim sum and sadly in Ohio we have few good options.  If you are in the Cleveland area this is a must eat.

If you are in Columbus check out Sunflower."}
{"text":"All 3 of our meals were cold and tasted awful. We didn't have the dim sum which may have been our mistake. I do find it hard to mess up egg rolls and sesame chicken."}
{"text":"One of only a few dim sum joints in Cleveland (Bo Loong is the other notable one, and they hold their own as well). It is a full fledged restaurant that is open very late, but they are mostly known for their dim sum lunch, and with good reason. It is THE go to spot for Cleveland Asians to get their dim sum fix.

It gets packed on weekends, so if you manage to get a table, you'll have to be vigilant with the cart ladies or you might be neglected. Some notable dishes are siumai (obvi), shrimp dumpling, chive dumpling, and tofu skin roll. I love sticky rice and turnip/taro cake, but theirs isn't that great. Oh, definitely request the crunchy crab balls, which aren't available on carts but might be the best thing you can get here.

Misc - Service is serviceable, no frills. There is still a bit of a language barrier so you'll have to rely on the old \"point at the ones you want\" method at times. Asking what specific items are is a lost cause unless you get to speak with the manager. Pricing is reasonable."}
{"text":"What a fun experience! We came for dim sum on a Saturday around noon. Our friends grabbed a table for us but they were seated right away. Parking in the lot was busy so we street parked no problem. The food was of quality, from what I could tell... I didn't get sick, so that's a win.
Very filling. This was the first meal and last meal of my day, so very filling."}
{"text":"I was dating a guy who asked me if I had ever been for Dim Sum, I hadn't, and I wasn't even sure what it was. 

After he explained it to me I decieded it sounded exactly like something I would love, so we headed to Li Wah's on a Sunday morning. 

When you walk in the shopping mall, you see a lot of designer knock off purses, and Li Wah's enterance. Some might find that a bit \"seedy\" but trust me, you'll get over it. 

The staff is friendly, even if they barely speak a lick of English. 

I was really pleased to see Asian's, EVERYWHERE, and all of them enjoying their food. That's always a good sign, especially since I have never been to any parts of Asia, so for me I go by my taste buds and not \"authentic\" or \"not authentic.\"

Needless to say I really enjoyed my experience. I have been back several times since. 

If you have dietary restrictions or an aversion to certain things then I wouldn't reccomend Dim Sum simply because half the people pushing the carts don't know what's in it. They'll agree with you or disagree with you to get you to buy whatever their selling. 

Go when it's busy because the food is fresh and you get a better variety from the carts. You can also order things from the menue and they will promptly be brought to the table. 

Do not guzzle your drink down, it's almost impossible to get a refill depending on how busy they are. The servers always seem distracted to me. 

All in all I love this place. It is what it is. Good food for hungry people."}
{"text":"Coming from a Chinese background, and originally a Pittsburgher, I was excited to find an establishment that served dim sum when I came to Cleveland (as there is practically no dim sum in Pittsburgh!)  Li Wah offers the classic dim sum served with carts around lunch time on the weekends, which is a happy site!  The dim sum itself is standard fare, with the classic shumai, chicken feet, turnip cakes, etc. being served.  After bringing various friends to dim sum, I did notice that it is not particularly vegetarian friendly, and many of their dishes are fried, so these might be important things to keep in mind.  Although definitely not the best dim sum I've had, the food is still tasty and the prices aren't bad.  For a dim sum place, Li Wah is satisfying and a pleasant find here in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The dim sum is so good here! I got the shark fin dumpling, shrimp dumpling, and beef tripe. 

However, I gave this place 3 stars because of the quality of their food. Tastes like it's sprinkled with MSG - making it more delicious. And also everything seems like it's super unhealthy. 

I would only recommend a friend to come here for dim sum!"}
{"text":"One of the only places for dim sum in Cleveland with comparable prices to other restaurants.  Every time I go, I see more Asians that I have ever seen in Cleveland in one place.  The location is large and airy with enough seating for the bustle of a busy Saturday Morning.  It is a good place to sit and have some authentic Cantonese food.

The waiter staff was surprisingly helpful and quick.  Our water was refilled more than once without asking and I was able to ask our waiter for dishes that I didn't see on the carts.   He was more than efficient in finding them and bringing them back to our table.  When we were ready, I was able to flag down our waiter almost instantly to get our check and another waiter without even asking took our check away because he saw that my card was with the bill.  That is good service

When I go, I always get the tripe, egg tart custards, pork pastry, and several other shrimp dishes.  I don't normally get whole duck or crispy pork belly here as it is a bit on the expensive side but they have it fresh in the front of the restaurant if you are interested.  Overall, I would go here to get my Dim sum fix in a heartbeat but I don't know if I would drive several hours for the food."}
{"text":"I can remember coming here as a little girl for dim-sum when bo loong was too crowded.  Now it seems the roles are reversed.  After a several year absence I've been to Li Wah twice in the past couple weeks.  The first time was for Asian New Year (Happy New Year!).  It wasn't very crowded at all, but I have been here for New Year in the past when it was jam packed (mostly after the lion parade)  The server was awesome.  I was with my lovely, but oh too healthy friends.  You know, the girls that won't eat beef, processed foods or anything overly bad for you.  We tried to order noodles with just vegetables and were looked at like we were complete idiots.  She wouldn't let us!  They finally had to settle for chicken and good thing we did.  They were amazing.  We also had chicken curry, veggie spring rolls and baby bok choy.  All of it tasted fresh and good.  I didn't get my usual Chinese food stomachache either.

Coming here gave me a hankering for dim sum so we went back on Sunday, they're busiest day.  There was a huge crowd of people crowding around the door and host stand so we put our names in, was told a wait time and waited.  And waited.  We watched as names were called out.  Finally I got a spot by the stand watched her process.  Pretty much every name was crossed off but ours and just a couple others.  Everyone after us was crossed off as well.  I honestly believe it's because we weren't Asian.  Well jokes on you, I'm a halfy.  Pretty annoying.  The dim sum was good but I have had better.  

I know they're not hurting for customers but that practice was really annoying.  I hostess at an Asian restaurant as well and I've made my own family members wait til it was their turn to for a table."}
{"text":"One of my best girl friends took me and the girls here for some dim sum after an eventful night out. This was our first time in Cleveland and we wanted some great eats. We got potstickers, shrimp dumplings, pork shumai, mussels, chinese broccoli, beef meatballs, and fried shrimp balls. All were pretty darn delicious, definitely better than some places in Michigan I've been too. We were so happy to be able to be get the food so quickly! I saw that they had roast pork and duck..omg. I was too full to get some, but next time I will definitely get some."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food. We got the shrimp in lobster sauce and the shrimp and vegetables. The vegetables were crisp and fresh. The lobster sauce was seasoned very nicely. The portions were large and so expect to take some home."}
{"text":"Li Wah is solid.  Great Quality Asian food consistent.  I enjoy it.  I've been here for lunch and dinner and I cannot say I have had anything bad.  I do wish the spicy mustard was a bit spicier but the taste of the spices and herbs in all the dishes I have had have really been pretty good.  Can be a little pricy but really a good meal for its cost"}
{"text":"Been coming here for as long as I can remember and it's pretty standard Chinese food, probably one of the better ones in Cleveland.  I'm not a fan of their dim sum though I think their cooked food is pretty good and reasonable."}
{"text":"Great place to eat as they have many dishes to choose from. Their Walnut Chicken is AMAZING! also they have great dim sum and egg drop soup!!!"}
{"text":"After my horrible experience at Sunflower in Columbus, I decided to make a trip to Cleveland after hearing about Li Wah from friends. Li Wah is probably the best dimsum place I've had in Ohio and the closest thing to what I had back in New York. Li Wah makes their dimsum in-house, not store-bought and reheated aka microwaved like Sunflower's. Most of the items are pretty standard, nothing too special as far as selection i.e. siu mai, shrimp dumplings, bbq pork buns, spring rolls, etc. We also ordered a beef hor fun from the entree menu which was good as well. Def recommended for anyone in Columbus who is in the mood for dimsum and is willing to drive 2 hours for it..."}
{"text":"We visit this restaurant on Sundays for dim sum and it has always been a pleasant experience. The food is good, the staff friendly and the interior clean.

One possible downside is that you won't know the price until after you've eaten. It's typically about $50 for 2 people.

The mussels and dumplings are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great food.  The food was sweeter than the Cantonese food I've had in China.   Some of the best Chinese food I've had in the US.   I wished they had more authentic Sichuan dishes.  However, it was delicious."}
{"text":"I get takeout here a couple times a month for lunch. Its pretty standard fare as far as Chinese take out goes. A plus for me is when you order sesame chicken or general tso you don't get the cheap pre-breaded nuggets (you will with sweet and sour chicken though).

This place gets the bump to 4 stars because of their Dim Sum. During the week they have the fried food carts and steamed carts rolling around the place. On the weekends they have these plus a soup cart, steamed mussels and more. The ladies that roll the carts around speak almost no English, but that's no problem. They will just start throwing food down on your table if you let them but everything is very well done and tasty so its okay.

If you have never had Dim Sum I suggest you go (check their hours though). It will be a food adventure."}
{"text":"There's always a long line around lunch time, so I don't come here too often. However it is Father's Day after all, so we made it a point to got up early. Arrived around 10:45am, right before the rush - people after us had to queue up for a table.

Items I like today: 

- Ma lai go ??? - Cantonese sponge cake: texture similar to angel food cake, it is a steamed cake made of sugar, egg, and flour. They don't always serve this item.

- Sticky rice bowl - ???? it came in a bowl. looks like fried rice. 

- Fried eggplant with embedded shrimp

- Egg tarts

- Turnip cake

- fried sticky rice ball with pork inside

Things I'm doubtful today:

- Soup dumplings ???: I was so excited to discover that they will make this for you upon request, thanks to yelper Keven C.'s tips. When I bit into the dumplings, something doesn't taste right. Maybe it's related to the ground meat they use today. See my next entry.

- beef meat balls: we ordered this often. There's usually no problem. But today I taste chemical in the the meat, similar to the meat in soup dumplings. I want to say chlorine...can't really tell. 

- char siu - the red bbq pork is a bit dry and stiff today. It didn't give me the impression that they made this today or this morning. 

When we were leaving, I saw they just started to serve pig feet ?? - so maybe it's worth it to come later for more varieties? 

When I went to use restroom, the floor was wet. Turned out one toilet was clogged or something, so I decided not to stink up my maxi dress by avoiding using it here altogether.

This is a fun place to take friends who's never tried dim sum before. If they had experienced it in Boston, San Francisco or Asian countries, skip Li wah and take them somewhere else more CLE-centric."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the city of Cleveland. They have authentic dim sum presented on dim sum carts. The food is a very good quality and service hot. It's like having the same type of food you can find in New York, Toronto, San Francisco but it's here in Cleveland. The dumplings are always very delicious. There are many different choices of dim sum."}
{"text":"This restaurant made the biggest mistake of Chinese food, which is NOT FRESH. I had the pork ribs and it tasted very obviously not fresh, possible frozen.  I had the second dim sum which looked like dumplings, but the skin and the inside separately immediately after I tried to pick it up with my chopsticks (btw, I know how to use chopsticks)! I'm 101% they froze the dumplings because the skin lost its elasticity. 

If this restaurant was in Chicago Chinatown, it would close pretty soon."}
{"text":"If you've ever been curious to try dim sum, get it here, it's the best place to go in Cleveland. I would recommend their lunch menu, as it is significantly cheaper than what you will spend on dinner.

I can't vouch for the rest of their menu, but the dim sum is fantastic and filling. Great for groups and very convenient to I-90."}
{"text":"A 4 star rating since I have not tried any other dim sum restaurant. I have nothing to compare Li Wah to, despite other dim sum restaurants locally. Have been frequenting Li Wah since I was a working man (lunch with coworkers, retired 2003) and have continued to eat here since.While working, enjoyed several menu items but their Walnut Chicken is the best. Dine here routinely these days with a friend. We always do a dim sum lunch and have yet to be disappointed. Last visit we sat for over an hour after we finished eating and the manager continued to circulate, keeping our water glasses filled. Very nice place, excellent service and good food. Also, the New Years celebration is fantastic! Bring your camera and the kids."}
{"text":"Good sit down family dinner! Fully enjoyed it! Especially the Mai Tai and the Poo Poo Plater! Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Love this place. I typically drove about an hour to get to this place along with other family members that traveled much further to get here. I now live in Southern California but I do visit here when I come back in town to visit family and friends.

This place is located in a plaza. It's much better now that they remodeled. The parking lot gets full fast when busy but there is street parking and another empty lot next to it that is available to use too. Not the greatest of an area.

Dim sum is good but it can be cold at times which is disappointing when myself and family members travel far to eat here. They do not use food covers. I have been to eat dim sum all over from San Francisco to New York and in between so I know great dim sum restaurants. I feel that Li Wah is pretty good considering that there is not much of an Asian cuisine with dim sum around the area so take that into consideration.

Come early on the weekend for dim sum and the food will be hot. Ordering from the menu is great! They will make any custom dish no problems.

It is not the most cleanliness place but it's good for a Chinese restaurant. Prices are decent for the area."}
{"text":"BBQ duck was the best. Everything else was mediocre. But it is the best dim sum but they have compared to all other places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Freaking rip off!  Haven't been there for a while and when I went back today, I found all small dish dim sum plates are now considered medium plates; and some medium plates are now upgraded to large plates (without upgrading the volume!)  So I used to pay around $25-$30 and now I paid almost $50 for two people.  What a rip off!  I will never go back there for dim sum anymore.  I can have a really fancy brunch for that price."}
{"text":"I was downtown dealing with some work things, and had been craving Chinese for a few days - perfect answer is obviously to go to Li Wah. I'd never been here for dinner before, only for Dim Sum. I definitely think their dim sum is better than dinner (and likely cheaper for the same or more food). I wasn't feeling very creative and went for comfort food, so sweet and sour chicken for me. 

The portion was sizable and had a good amount of peppers and onions with it. It was flavorful and probably the best sweet and sour chicken ever. My dining companion had lemon chicken, and finished most of it. I also really like their tea. The portions are large enough that even though we were both starving, we would have had enough for lunch the next day. I didn't get enough rice, but I'm sure if we could have found our waiter, he would have brought more (another bummer about not getting dim sum - there are always TONS of employees). A weird note: the tvs were all silent with Spanish subtitles. I wasn't watching tv, but it was weird.

Now onto the bad. I really struggled with whether this deserved one or two stars. I'm giving it two because I've had so many good experiences here in the past. So we're winding up our meal and the person I was with went to the restroom. He noticed an employee wearing an apron walk out of a stall after flushing, texting, and walk past the sinks. No washing of hands. YUCK. I was glad that we had eaten already but that is just disgusting. As soon as my partner came back, the waiter asked if we wanted to to containers. Um, no thank you. If I wasn't done eating, after I heard this I was. When we left (after paying), we told the woman at the register about what happened and she was just like, \"Meh. Okay. Sorry about that\". 

Now I need to find a new place for dim sum"}
{"text":"Went there for dim sum on saturday.

There wasn't much selection, and the hostess asked us if we wanted a few dishes that were just cooked (they turned out to be lukewarm).

C&Y's dim sum is better."}
{"text":"Dim sum!! Try their meatballs and ask for worcestershire sauce to dip it in. Also if you are feeling adventurous they have a stir fry frog dish I strongly recommend."}
{"text":"The food was good but one thing happened today, which made me very disappointed. I had lunch today and wanted to use some coin as part of the tips. Other tips I wrote on the check and total was 15%. When I put the coin on the table, a waiter behind me said:\" we usually take 15% as tips. But it seems no more than $1 on the table.\" (He didn't notice I also wrote tips amount on the check.) I was unhappy and pointed out that I have given enough tips. And then the waiter just said :\" can I take the check and tips?\" NO APOLOGY!!! 

I was waitress and I understand they rely on tips for living. But did you even take a look at the check? How did you judge I wouldn't pay enough tips? And did your restaurant require mandatory 15% tips for lunch? Why no one suspect I didn't pay enough tips before when I was with my friends and also used coin as part of tips? What happened today was just because I was alone? If others pay less than 15%, will you ask them to pay more? No, you will not."}
{"text":"Delicious dim sum spot in Cleveland, we had a party of over 20 people and they were able to accommodate us all, but we did have to get there around 11 before the place got really packed. 

Service is decent, no frills. Definitely is a language barrier but not terrible, you really just point and nod to what you want on the cart. We didn't order any items off the menu. 

The food was great, we filled up on a bunch of dumplings, duck and sticky rice before realizing they actually have a cart for steamed mussels and other really tasty delicacies. We sat on the far right and I noticed a few patrons were hyper vigilant about seeking carts and dishes out. As the restaurant got packed some tables we being a little neglected."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Friday and it wasn't too busy at all. My first cart dim sum experience.

Veggie spring roll: VERY good
Shrimp-stuffed frozen tofu: VERY good, yum
Chicken potstickers: ok, but then again I'm not a huge fan of potstickers most of the time
Steamed tofu skin shrimp pork roll: tofu skin was good
Baked BBQ pork bun: YUM

It was a nice experience."}
{"text":"If you've thought of dim sum (yum cha), Li Wah was a choice to explore. Be the explore and try dim sum brunch if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Having been spoiled with dim sum on the west coast, it's hard to find a place in the midwest that measures up. I've tried dim sum in Columbus, Cinci, and now cleveland and this place is the best of the 3 cities. They have a good selection with many carts circling the floor. The only really bad thing I've had are the steamed BBQ pork buns - there's something really weird about the pork (tastes old). I forgot about them the 2nd time and got them again and still the same problem. The eggplant and taro dishes are my favorite. Everything else is just okay but the service and large variety is good enough for me to quench my dim sum cravings."}
{"text":"Chinese food that tastes like Chinese food. Nuff said. Doesn't happen very often in Cleveland.

Ryan, I don't see how you can be much harsher. The food is genuinely good, wherever it's served. There are plenty of bad Chinese places in So Cal that Li Wah beats by miles. I really like the bbq pork buns. On a good day they're soft and salty and coated with that lovely glaze- delish!

On the regular menu, the westlake beef soup and pan fried noodle taste like they should. Both pretty solid."}
{"text":"Eating here makes me feel like I'm back in Hong Kong again! Going on a Sunday for dim sum is a guaranteed good decision, with everything prepared just as I remember it. Just be careful that your eyes aren't bigger than your stomach given how quickly the dishes can pile up on your table if you simply order what looks good! Definitely go for the eggplant, and getting the shao mai is always a safe bet even for more picky eaters. 

Going here for dinner on a regular night is a treat as well, with the pigeon matching exactly what I wanted, right down to the Tsingtao beer to go along with it! I'll definitely be making a return trip here, especially because it feels like a return trip to China."}
{"text":"There aren't very many dim sum restaurants in Cleveland, but Li Wah is by far the best in the area. There is a wide variety of various dishes, and all the trademark dim sum dishes are there, such as the har gow and the luo bo gao. They also have some items that are more likely to be seen at bakeries, such as pineapple buns and egg tarts. Li Wah is one of two restaurants in Cleveland that have dim sum in carts, which helps make the experience be just as authentic as the food itself. Must-go place for dim sum lovers in the area."}
{"text":"Great shrimp won ton soup. Broth was por perfectly seasoned. The shrimp wontons were big and tasted incredible. There were a lot of choices with their dim sum. We had the Shu Mai, 3 types of shrimp dumplings, pork bun. They were all perfect. Some of the best I have had. Only item I was not impressed with was the pot stickers. Looking forward to coming back to Cleveland and trying again."}
{"text":"Li Wah never disappoints when It comes to authentic dishes. Good servers, and good food. This place is a gem to the asian community."}
{"text":"Dim sum. I love dim sum. This restaurant is huge and was severely packed (with a line out the door) when I visited. The wait was not bad though, which made my hangry tummy so happy.

There were some dishes that didn't strike my fancy (like the eggplant and the chicken feet) but the quality was there. I've been weird into texture lately, so I feel that had a lot to do with my dislike in these select dishes.

Now, for the good stuff. When you go, you NEED:

The duck (although pricey, is worth it)
Shrimp
Chinese Broccoli
Porn Buns
Dumplings with shrimp
Mussels

There is so much on the menu, as there is in all dim sum joints, so it's a bit overwhelming. 
BUT, if it is your first time, check out the list I provided above. Nothing on this list will disappoint."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese restaurant in the Asian plaza.  Good service and great food at a reasonable price. Drink options are only so so"}
{"text":"If you love dim sum you won't be disappointed by coming here!! They also have great soup dumplings (Xia Long Bao). I wish I would have know about this place earlier in the year when I first moved here! GREAT customer service and food!!!"}
{"text":"Neat place. Dim Sum was good but didn't blow my socks off. Some dumplings we liked more than others. It's definitely a fun experience. They come around with little carts of dim sum, pork buns, soups, and noodles and just load you up with whatever you want: an authentic experience. Service was quick...you weren't without food for long until another cart came by. They are not very helpful at explaining what's inside the dumplings or buns though....language barrier and all...but it probably doesn't matter much because the food is overall pretty yummy. Again...not the BEST I've had, but probably the best in the area at least. 

For those who don't know, the dim sum service happens M-F from 10-2. You don't order off the menu for dim sum. They come around to your table with a cart, ask what you want , then put it on your table. Usually you get 3-4 dumplings per serving. They leave a check on your table that serves as a tally sheet where they keep track of everything you choose from the cart. 

It's a neat experience. You should try it!"}
{"text":"I am really shocked that this is not rated as a 5 star because, if rating solely on food, it is authentic perfection.  Granted it is in a hole in the wall shopping plaza,but I am basing this rating on the food as it holds its own.  Actually, the surrounding shops are really fun to look at, more on that later.  This is the second time my husband and I have eaten here for Sunday Dim Sum.  I highly recommend you arrive early lest you want to be part of the very long line that forms outside.  Ordering the Dim Sum can be a little intimidating.  Pick up the menu and see what looks good.  They will bring carts around and you can basically choose what you want and how many.  If things are taking a little longer than you want and can't find what you are looking for, I suggest a little prompting.  Just tell them what you are looking to find.  My favorite is the baked BBQ bun, wow just wow!  Also, love the pork and shrimp won tons.  Peking duck was not my thing but cool to watch it being roasted.  My husband's favorite is the sticky rice.  It comes wrapped in lotus leaves.  Kids came with us the second visit.  My daughter just ordered the lo  mein   Chicken meal.  She chowed down!!  Took it home and had enough for her to eat 2 more meals.  She is a fan.  We will certainly frequent this place when in Cleveland.  It's great to bring a group as Dim Sum lends itself well to the social aspect of dining with friends.   As for the nearby shops, daughter bought a dragon tea set, son found rubber nun chucks and a ginormous Pikachu stuffed animal.  Had a great time!"}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST DIM SUM IN CLEVELAND! ;)

Okay, the dim sum is so-so.  But this is where all of my Asian friends (myself included) go to satisfy our occasional dim sum cravings here in the Cleve.  It's sort of like the bubble tea at Koko Bakery - the dim sum here is not particularly good, but it's the best that Cleveland has to offer.  There was one time that I had dim sum in Maryland and, a week later, had dim sum here.  That's when I realized how bad it really was.  After living in Cleveland so long, you really do develop lower standards for Chinese food.

The steamed pork buns (char siu bao/cha shao bao) are the best - they are warm, have a good amount of filling, and are comparable to those in, dare I say, California.  The rest of the food is so-so but good by Cleveland standards.  For example, the shrimp dumplings (xia jiao/ha gao) are sort of tough to chew and sticky compared to other cities.  Same with the shumei (shao mai).  The shrimp rice noodle rolls (xia chang fun) have too few shrimp and the skin is too thick.  

I've also tried Li Wah's regular food, which again, is good by Cleveland standards.  I catered a party for 40 people with food from Li Wah, and everyone was asking me where I got such good Chinese food.  (It was 5 trays of dishes for $250, btw.)  And yes, they do put MSG in their food - I asked.

They speak cantonese in the restaurant, and sometimes they don't understand you if you speak mandarin to them."}
{"text":"As a girl who spent three weeks trekking through China and eating anything and everything, Li Wah is traditional perfection. The dim sum is delicious. The dumplings are great, the pork buns are inspirational, the chicken feet are pretty tasty, and everything look scrumptious. The cart-pushers are very accommodating to people who are new to dim sum, and they're constantly stopping by with more treats to try. Plus, it's crazy cheap if you're eating in a group. A meal for seven ended up being $7 a person, including tip. Li Wah is my new favorite weekend brunch spot."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!! TERRIBLE AWFUL!! My fiancé and I got off work at 4:00 last Friday and went here to have dinner. We were not greeted by the staff, instead we were told repeatedly: \"We have large party. We have large party. 5:50 5:50 large party!  - All food\". We asked to be seated at a table and were refused service!  There were over 30 empty tables!!! We will never go back!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I read reviews on Yelp as I was making my way across the country and figured I would give this a place a chance as it was right off the interstate and had a parking lot. Plus it had great reviews. The wife and I split  the sweet egg dim sum, BBQ pork dim sum, (Both were the small plates) and the kung pow chicken. Everything was great except for the server who didn't show up at the table for about 10 minutes after we sat down. We were pleased overall with our food."}
{"text":"this review is for their dim sum. I haven't had enough of their regular menu items to be a good judge of the non dim sum fare. 

we lived in Cleveland for a while and for a period of about a year, we would get dim sum here every single weekend. we were back in Cle for a wedding this weekend and couldn't resist a trip to li wah. 

the atmosphere is ok. it's nothing really special, but it's nice. it is in a weird location in a mall. but just make it past that and i think you'll be in love. 

the selection is just great and almost everything is really yummy. the siu mai, sticky rice, the potstickers, shrimp balls, and baked BBQ pork buns are my personal favs. max really loves the hot pepper prawns too. 

the service is always great. everyone is so nice and accommodating. and they're very good at handling large groups. 

I'd definitely recommend trying it. so so so good."}
{"text":"Always delicious. This is a Dim Sum destination for us on the weekends. Suggest arriving before 11:00 am or after 1:30 pm because there are lines sometimes. But no worries..they move fast. I love the meatballs and shrimp dumplings. You will not go away hungry!  Very good value too."}
{"text":"A bit expensive and limited in its variety, it makes up for it in competence and loneliness as the only Dim Sum place I've been to in the Cleveland. It is a bustling no frills eatery full of Chinese people on Sunday and the food gets better later but it is also more crowded. I am going back, but it really needs competition. The 4 is a 3.5 rounded up."}
{"text":"A very typical Chinese-American restaurant in terms of taste. I came here with my dad on a Sunday evening and ordered the black pepper sizzling beef, green beans, and shanghai spring rolls. The spring rolls seemed like they had just been fried from frozen and didn't have much flavor to them besides oil. The green beans were coated in sweet and sour sauce, which made finishing them kind of sickly and difficult. The beef was downed in sauce and too chewy, so it was kind of hard to appreciate. Since they were rib slices, my dad compared them to the korean dish la galbi and told me to leave this kind of beef to the Koreans.

I will say I was happy with the complimentary appetizer of tossed cucumber. I also heard they specialize in fish, but I didn't have a chance to try it out. I have also heard they have dim sum on the weekends, which is a personal favorite of mine.

Overall, I want to come back and try the other things that I couldn't experience. Maybe I've just been choosing the wrong dishes. Some genuine Chinese places have low ratings as it's not so much about appearance or service but rather just food. However, this experience was not the best, so I will stick with a low rating."}
{"text":"Li Wah is my go-to dim sum spot near Cleveland. Their main dim sum dishes are what you expect. Their more special dim sum dishes like chinese broccoli or duck with bao can run you $7.50 so make sure you really want it. The servers speak chinese, so it may be hard to tell them what you want. Egg tart runs out quick, so either order some or be aggressive when you see a server come out with a fresh batch. Their pork buns have a bad pork to bun ratio, so you'll be getting a lot of bread. Their tripe is solid. I normally get 2 orders of this. Every other dish is about average. They also serve you tea and you can ask for iced water along with hot mustard for your food. Overall, decently priced and a good fix for dim sum for this geographical location. Cannot complain."}
{"text":"Unfortunately (fortunately?), I've had dim sum in Flushing, NY and have been comparing places in America to that experience. At Li Wah, the flavors were just alright. I felt like I needed to salt many of the dishes. The service is just alright also, though you can't expect much from Asian places in general. Decor was drab (but clean!!). 

Overall, it was a lackluster experience. Maybe because it was a Friday afternoon..? It sounds like weekend dim sum is the place to be from other reviews."}
{"text":"When it comes to dim sum in Cleveland, we don't have a whole lot of options, and this is the best. At busy times (weekend afternoons), it's fresh and tasty. Not the best you'll ever have, but lots of variety and that wonderful instant gratification. Service is very good and the food is tasty. If you just want to order off a menu, I'd pick another nearby Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"have wanted to try DimSum for MANY years .. finally got the chance on 11-1-15 .. went just when the busy lunch rush started to line up but only waited for a table about 10 minutes (2 in our party) .. did not enjoy the cramped seat in the corner near the rest room but we were out of the way of others constantly being bumped by the flurry of activity w/the carts coming & going .. gotta say what we tried was really tasty .. wanted to try more but could not seem to get the items we wanted to whisk by & trying to get the attention of a server to communicate properly what we wanted (language barrier) was a task of its own .. will go back to hopefully try what I missed this time around"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch today. As soon as we were seated the nearest cart came over and started our dim sum journey. We tried the shrimp noodles, pork buns, dumplings, wonton soup and a few other things i cant remember. The wonton soup was a bit weird tasting but not bad, and the rest of the dim sum was amazing. We will be back."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving Dim Sum I come here! This service here is quick and the food is delicious! There are some things that you need to order from the menu that is included because of how it is made and served which wasn't such a big deal.  Just show the picture or point to the number and they will get on it right away. 

Try to pace yourself because they will continue to come around every couple of minutes to see if you would like to other more.  I went with a couple of guys and ended up over ordering because they wanted to try a bunch of stuff.  Their egg custards are definitely amazing to eat as a sweet treat in the end along with your hot jasmine tea!

Best dim sum in town at the moment! So come and get it!"}
{"text":"The dim sum here is pretty tasty.  The dishes are all fresh and hot, and they have a wide variety of things to try.  I like the picture menu too if you want something that they don't have on the carts at the moment."}
{"text":"I've grown up eating dim sum at Cantonese restaurants in New York, so this may be the reason why I am a little underwhelmed.  There aren't too many places in Cleveland where you can get dim sum - you can either go to Li Wah or drive up a few blocks and go to Bo Loong.  People are always comparing the two.  My friend and I decided the only fair way to judge would be to eat dim sum from both places on the same day.

Both places were okay, but I thought that Li Wah's was a little better.  I ate a char siu baau (roast pork bun) and a cheung fan (rice noodle roll) from both places.  The char siu baau was a little moister and tastier at Li Wah.  My friend, who has eaten dim sum in Guangzhou, compared more of the dim sum and thought that the dim sum at Li Wah was fresher and tasted a little better.

The availability of dim sum definitely depends on the day.  I went with one group of friends on a Saturday and another group on a Sunday.  On one day there were a ton of options, while on another day it seemed like the same cart of food was going past our table over and over again.

Li Wah also serves dinner and does catering.    One night, my friends and I ordered the dinner for 6, which gives a very generous amount of food.  The waitress was nice enough to allow us substitute dishes (as long as they were of equal value).  I thought the noodle dishes (beef chow fun, pan fried noodles) were very good.  Some of the other dishes (lemon chicken and basil chicken) were average.  I like the soup better at the other restaurants in Cleveland's Asia Town.

All in all not bad experiences, but I prefer the restaurants in New York's Chinatown."}
{"text":"Average dim sum food, but the service is absolutely the worst. Would not consider going back there anytime soon. I hope other customers have better luck..."}
{"text":"Great places for dim sum. Make sure to try the crispy shrimp balls! Their menu items are ok but some are better than others. I usually just order a bunch of different dim sum and it is very affordable!"}
{"text":"Good place for morning tea and dim sum. Could be very crowded any day after 11:30 am since it serves the entire Asian population of Cleveland and around. Service was friendly. Shiu mai, shrimp dumplings and chicken claws were nice and authentic. Egg tarts and congee were a bit too small. Also offer something called Almond Tofu with pineapple on top. Never tried it before but it was quite a good dessert."}
{"text":"Very solid dim sum experience.  Not as good as Hong Kong, New York or California, but I was impressed by the variety for Cleveland.  I went at 10:30am on a Sunday, and the majority of the items weren't out yet.  They came around with the roast duck and pig after we were almost done.

The service is quick and attentive.  The flavors are good.  My favorites were the pork filled taro croquette, the turnip cake, and the shu mai.  My usual favorite--the char siu bao weren't as filled as I'm used to.  I didn't get a chance to have the chicken feet, but they looked the way they're supposed to.

Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'll make it a point to go back."}
{"text":"Good Dim Sum 
Good service 
Fair prices 
Much seating 
In the mall of Asia Palace
Have not been here for 9 years but glad to see they're still around"}
{"text":"One of my favorites Chinese restaurants, just wish the service was more friendly, anyways would go back anytime."}
{"text":"COULD NOT WAIT for some quality dim sum in Ohio. Walked in starving and inhaled the first 5 dishes of pure carbs and very little meat that came our way and regretted it fully as my stomach started filling up. A fantastic cultural experience and fun little place for a big group but a bit pricey and the food quality was very average. I wouldn't go back but I am glad I tried it out!"}
{"text":"Caution: I'm utterly, disastrously biased. I live in San Francisco, with a very robust Chinese diaspora. That alone results in Chinese at least twice times per week from as many places I can find. On that note, I wish I could return to boost my rating. This place was really worth it, and I recommend you try it for yourself! Remember 3-stars means A-OK! :)

The Great: Honey Peppered Beef! I've never had this dish before, and whoever posted the photo on Yelp deserves mad props! I figured it looked good, and I liked the idea of asparagus, zucchini, tomatoes, and beef. The sauce wasn't overwhelmingly sweet - in fact, it had a bit of savory tang to it. Everything was prepared well, the beef was tender and delicious, and it ate in one sitting. Very delicious - a 4-star dish in my book.  

The Good: Tea. Let's be real, tea can do a lot for a meal. You have bad tea, your meal isn't as enjoyable. The tea was good. 

The Disappointment: Egg Drop Soup. While the egg itself was great and I could tell it was prepared on the spot, the actual liquid was below my lowest standards. I would've rather had the egg in spiced water vs the greasy, tasteless yellow-dyed muck it was served in. I knew I should have ordered Wonton...  

...

Cost: This place is priced just perfectly! A great value all around."}
{"text":"Positives: They were open late. The menu was very descriptive and had a lot to offer. The servers were fun and informational. The cons: The food was cooked in so much oil. Saturated in it. Leftovers not worth taking home."}
{"text":"The dim sum is really good with more subtle notes to the seasoning than the dim sum I have had other places. The menu is pretty basic as far as dim sum goes but I was able to find my favorites. The scallion pancakes were really good. I loved the sauce for the pot stickers. Service was good and prices were very affordable.

Cons - temperature, I found most of my dim sum was a little cool but it wasn't a busy day. The bathroom was a little dingy."}
{"text":"I haven't been here to try their dim sum, but I have gotten delivery from them courtesy of delivery service delivermefood.com

Compared to Great Taste which I had in my first week in Cleveland, Li Wah definitely affords a more authentic and wider range of dinner options.

+ House special pan fried noodles: no, this isn't that chow mein fried noodle crap that belongs on \"asian salads\". This is legitimate Cantonese-style wok fried noodles with a seafood/meat/veggie sauce that goes over it. Delivery separates the two so you can combine it at your leisure, eliminating the fear of receiving a soggy sopping mess. I swear, If you don't order this dish from Li Wah for dinner, you will fail. This dish is hard enough to find in Chicago's Chinatown, but you'll find it at Li Wah.
+ House special fried rice: better quality rice than Great Taste, but they skimp on the meat and veggies making it mostly rice. Delicious otherwise.
+ Pan fried dumplings: the rectangular/open-end kind of dumpling that has been lightly pan-fried. I like this rendition just as much as the round dumpling kind. Accompanying sauce is excellent.
+ Shrimp chips: if you like them less shrimpy/gamey than Great Taste's, I would recommend getting a bag of them. It's only $1.50!

- Shrimp won ton soup: maybe I need to have it fresh, but the dumplings were a bit soggy. Also, the soup is a tad on the salty side. Scallions on top are a nice touch though.
- Egg roll: I guess I'm not a huge fan of the bulbous looking deep fried egg rolls. I don't know how to explain it, but really if the skin of the fried egg roll looks smooth, I like. If it's pocketed and obviously fried beyond crisp, I no like.

Get the house special pan fried noodles!"}
{"text":"Dim sum here is far superior to that at Bo Loong... And that's saying something, because Bo Loong is hard to top for dim sum.
It is more expensive though, but the taste here is more fresh to me, and the place is cleaner.  I was really surprised because I don't really care for HoWah, which is owned by the same family (from what I understand), but Li Wah is excellent.  I'm glad I tried it!"}
{"text":"I really don't know what to say about Li Wah but yum fricken yum!!  I've only been here for Dim Sum (twice) and each time I really enjoyed the food options.  Each time we've had over 5 people dining for lunch, 2 of whom are Asian, which makes ordering a breeze.  I have no idea what we get only that out of the 7-10 dishes, there wasn't one I didn't enjoy.  I even almost tried the chicken feet but since it was a favorite of one of the dining patrons, I let her indulge herself.  

A couple favorites are the pork meatball, beef meatball, some smokey noodle dish, spring rolls, pork buns, shrimp balls, and I can't forget about the pot stickers.  Since the orders are done in Chinese, I really don't know the exact name of each dish, but I probably could point them out. 

We've all decided that visiting Li Wah needs to happen at least once a month and I couldn't agree more.  I could spend hours just snacking on this deliciousness, you should get over there for lunch and sample for yourself."}
{"text":"5 of us went after concert downtown. Mediocre at best. Never order Peking Duck here! It was just horrible. Skin not crispy, and meat was mixed up with some bean sprouts and green peppers sauces. Duck tasted old not fresh.. I orderd half duck, maybe i got 3 ounces. Our sons ribs came out cold like refrigerator cold, sent back and they microwaved them. Granddaughters chicken very tough. I could go on and on...what happened to Li Wahs food? We did not try dim sum, we were afraid to order anything else. We told servers about our food and disappointment., nothing was done. Prices to high for quality. Try Siam or Boolong if you want you eat asian in that area."}
{"text":"The food tends to be good to very good. Some days however the kitchen may be off.  One day the chicken with black bean sauce was greasy. Service tends to be slow.  However, the restaurant is popular among the city's Chinese community and almost every customer is Asian. Bad point: The neighborhood is less than safe. A high profile violent crime occurred in the Asia Plaza shopping center not long ago. Go during the day, not at night.  Other bad point: the halls of the shopping center smell like something awful.  For the person who doubted the area could be called a 'Chinatown': this was once Cleveland's Chinese district, but most Chinese have moved to suburbs or passed on. Calling it 'Asiatown' is a tourism gimmick to generate interest in the neighborhood. The Chinese area is pretty small, most of the surrounding streets are black or remnants of the once populous Croatian and Slovenian communities."}
{"text":"To be fair.... It was decent. It's the only Dim Sum place I tried in Cleveland. I'm from LA so you can't compare this to LA. 

I got Togo. The service was really nice. She was helpful. 

They did run out of the BBQ pork Buns ??? which was disappointing. 

BBQ Pork- quarter order. She tried to get me to order a half order but I told her no. The meat was good. Kind of dry. 

Roasted Duck- once again tried to get me to do a half order. I told her no. The meat was good. Lots of fat. Juicy. Tasted good. 

Rice wrapped in lotus leaf- this was the best thing here. They put BBQ pork in it which made it really good! 

Pineapple Bun- these are the regular buns. ???not????it didn't taste hot nor did it taste fresh 

XLB- ???were ok. She tried to talk me out of this twice. She said it would take over 10 minutes and told me \"Americans like potstickers better\". It was weird. 

MaLa Cake- ??? was delicious! One of the best ones I've had ever. 

This place fine."}
{"text":"This is a great dim sum place.  Although I am not Chinese, I went with some Chinese frineds that could help us communicate with the servers.  They had some great vegetarian options like the taro cake and the veggie dumplings.  The restaurant was packed with Asian people on Sunday at noon, and there were lots of dim sum options to choose from.  Some other favorites at our table were the shrimp dumplings and the pork buns.  If you like Dim Sum, I recommend that you give it a try."}
{"text":"It was everything I hoped for and more. Staff was very friendly and helpful for us 1st timers. We spent around $40 and had the duck, BBQ pork, shumi, shrimp dumplings, egg or spring rolls, potstickers, some rice noodles roll with scallions, baked BBQ pots bun. They give you some very tasty hot tea and all kinds of yummy sauces. Dim sum is everyday but they start at 930 on Saturday and Sunday! Good to know"}
{"text":"I have now been there both for their Dim Sum service and their normal dinner service. Their Dim Sum sim is absolutely the best in the Cleveland area, bar none. I have gone with several groups, including those who are sticklers for authentic Chinese dim sum, and they agree with me that Li Wah is THE place to get good Dim Sum in Cleveland.

Their normal dinner service is not too different from other restaurants outside that they offer a abridged dim sum menu that you can order combinations from. It was very good. I ordered the tried and true General Tso's combination and was very happy with my choice. I definitely recommend this restaurant to all fans of dim sum and Chinese food in general."}
{"text":"I work for a major sports network on a crew working baseball. We worked the Indian game last week. I called ahead of time and spoke to Randy, I gave him my budget and told him our crew is 35 people and has a few vegetarians on it. With that info he put together an awesome menu. We got to game time and it was a rain out. I quick called Randy, explained what happened and they were able to make the meal 3+ hours earlier than planned right in the middle of their busy time at the restaurant. They provided us to go boxes and delicious food. My crew was super happy to have dinner so quickly, they were hot and wet from the rain and having a great meal made them smile. Thank you Li Wah crew, you were awesome the entire time and sometimes a person in my position can make restaurants crazy with all our \"needs\". I appreciate your helpfulness, and would suggest them highly for larger orders, if they pulled off a meal for 35 at a baseball field I'd  guess they do a great job in the restaurant. Thanks again!

Oh and we probably fed 50 people but ordered for 35! Great value."}
{"text":"Li Wah is some of the best Cantonese food that Cleveland has to offer.  It offers an awesome selection of dim sum at lunch as well as a comprehensive Cantonese menu.  This restaurant, on E. 30th and Payne Ave. in Chinatown is an anchor tenant to the Chinese plaza where it is located.

The dim sum has been a five star experience the last few times I have visited.  Carts are pushed around with all the entrees that I crave.  Fresh-baked bbq pork buns, sui mai, ha gow, turnip cakes, and deep-fried taro are all available on a minute's notice.  On the weekends at lunch time, there is virtually no wait for a cart to arrive with all the staples.  I have had dim sum in many cities around the U.S. and China, and this place is my favorite!

Cantonese dishes are also popular, with the usual American dishes as well as authentic Chinese menu items.  The last time I visited, the Cantonese lobster had very fresh lobster.  The sauce seemed a little different than the lobster sauce I am used to, with sliced pieces of pork instead of minced pork.  There is nothing better than pulling fresh lobster off of the shell.  The chicken we ordered was also very fresh and tasted like it was made to order.  Tofu and clams were executed well.

I would recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to entertain family and friends are in the downtown Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, but never for Lunar New Year Celebration! Went as a part of a fairly large group (57 people) and along with everyone else in the restaurant (seemed like every table was taken) had to have noticed operations ran smoothly. From the food delivery to the quality of each dish (multi course meal that included dumplings, chicken, lobster, fish, westlake soup, etc.) to the entertaining fireworks, drums and dragon display, Li Wah did an outstanding job!"}
{"text":"My family and I are from Columbus and we frequent here often when we visit family. I absolutely love dim sum and this was a pretty good place to get it. I'm not familiar with the area but from the outside the place looks sketchy. The inside is pretty nice. The food was good though the service could have been better."}
{"text":"Ah, Li Wah.  Haven of late night Chinese food deliciousness and random drunken debauchery.

Now, I've rarely been to Li Wah before 11pm, and I mention this only because I think that the best qualities of the place appear during the late night hours, amongst hoards of theatre people after a show, or to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, or loss of virginity.

The food is fantastic; they make the best General Tso's I've ever had, have great standard hot & sour, wonton, and egg drop soup, and serve some of the largest portions around for the price - I always have leftovers for the next day, or later that night.  Or morning.

They also serve alcohol, which is a huge bonus for many, though I usually just have endless green tea and water.  All the regular (de)hydration is available, as well as QUALITY sake, and a kick ass drink called a volcano (see photo), which is made up of several different liquors (and possibly some heavy duty cleaning solvents) and has a shot in the middle, which they light on fire before handing it to many a drunken, accident-prone patron.

Other bonuses: they stay open LATE.  I actually don't even know when they close, but we have never been kicked out, and I know we've stayed at times until well past 2am.  They also know us, and know that although we are generally a large, raucous bunch, we respect them and appreciate them and tip them well, so service is always great (except for that one time with the new waitress who couldn't speak enough English to take our order, poor girl - THAT was a rough night).

Possibly my favorite bonus: occasionally, someone will reserve one of the larger rooms for some big event like a Chinese wedding, during which we are able to observe some absolutely priceless drunken Chinese karaoke.  I can't even describe it.  Amazing.

Add to that the presence of some cool Chinese shops across the hall, giant tanks of live sea creatures (whose demise I try not to imagine), and big tables with giant lazy susans in the middle to make sharing entrees and passing around condiments and tea that much easier, and that equals my favorite Chinese place, ever.

So if you're in need of a big helping of great Chinese food, look no further.  If you haven't been here already, go.  Now.  As in, turn off your computer, for real.  Report back to me and let me know what you have consumed so I know you are not slacking.

(Note: Had a version of this one up before, but wanted to make it current since I'm back in Cleveland now!)"}
{"text":"Loved this place. We came for the dim sum and it did not disappoint. We had the wonton soup with the shrimp dumplins, crispy shrimp balls, shu mai, deep fried pork dumpling and the steamed shrimp dumpling. The crispy dumpling was my favorite, however I enjoyed it all.  To order the dim sum a woman comes around with a cart and the menu shows what each individual small plate is.  An amazing experience that you must try. They only aerve the dim sum 11-3pm. It wasn't very busy but it was raining, I've been told that there generally is a line."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic place. Dim sums are made in a very authentic way (I would say 100% Chinese and 0% American), and there are so many choices of dim sum, which makes me feel that this place is better than the most visited dim sum restaurant in New York."}
{"text":"The best place to get Dim Sum or really any variety of Chinese in Cleveland. It's a bustling, spacious affair in an Asian plaza in a pretty dead part of the East side. The inside is well-lit, the cart ladies and the wait staff are all friendly, unassuming people; there's nothing wrong there.

I'm really flip-flopping between 3 and 4 stars for Li Wah because the dim sum is all over the place in terms of quality. The cha siu bao are pretty fantastic, and just about the best thing they offer here. I don't visit without getting an order or two of them. Their sticky rice is also awesome. Just a little sweet, the meat is properly cooked, and a good portion size too. Some things are a definite miss, though-- the siu mai come to mind. Chewy, almost rubbery with a really odd texture to the shrimp.

On the bright side, they don't mess up the tea-- jasmine, I think. It's never oversteeped. Tea is just as important to Dim Sum as the food, so it's something you should always watch for when trying out a dim sum place.

As far as dim sum in Cleveland, goes, it's basically your only option, and it's good enough to have me coming back four or five times. There are some things you should avoid, but overall it's a pretty good meal at a decent price."}
{"text":"Wow, China town brought authentic to a whole new level. I dined here with my best friend and his family, for brunch, and they gave me the inside scope of the \"do eats and don'ts\" from dining so often as this was a local place his grandfather use to bring his father, then later my friend, Greg.

Although I am not one to know much about Asian food, they filled me in on what to know. Here's the scoop; carts get pushed around and you order from what you see, or the menu, but go by vision. Although I am unsure of the technical names of the dishes I ate, I can assure you, it is all FABULOUS. What an awesome experience of trying foods I had never tasted, but to be apart of it all? Awesome, especially with a line out of the door, so get there early.

Eat the following; sticky buns with pork, rolled rice with pork stuffed inside, green vegetables with oyster sauce, and the pastries with the yellow filling.


Take a chance and order it, you'll love the whole experience!"}
{"text":"This place is like the best dim sum place in Cleveland, but yet it's not that great. Worse service ever and food is not always fresh since we had to point out to them that one of our dish was spoiled ."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it! Good dimsum.
The restaurant is pretty big and was pretty busy during Sunday lunch when I came. 
We had a good amount of food and the total came out to be around $15/person"}
{"text":"This place has really good dim sum. It's definitely better than anything you can get in Michigan, and rivals the stuff you can get in Toronto/Markham (and according to my brother, even rivals Hong Kong's).  There's not too much MSG, everything is fresh, and reasonably priced.  

Their main menu is great too.  Again, not too much MSG, not too greasy, and reasonably priced.  Standout dishes for me include Dungeness crab with ginger/green onion, beef chow fun (they use fresh rice noodles, which makes a huge difference), and roasted suckling pig (the skin is perfectly crispy and the meat is very tender).  Pretty much everything I've eaten there I enjoyed.  

I do have to say that one time, we ordered jellyfish and there were shards of broken glass inside that my mom and brother both bit into...thank God they didn't slice open their tongues or the inside of their mouths.  We saw that as an isolated incident, though - thankfully, that hasn't happened to us since then.  Normally, an experience like this would make me not want to go back ever again.  The fact that we're willing to keep going back there after this incident should say something about how good the food is."}
{"text":"I came here recently for dim sum when I visited some family in Cleveland.  We got there at 2 pm and the restaurant was half empty. We were seated and able to order right away.  We ordered a few items and they were brought soon after but then the servers never returned. The servers were not really aggressive as far as asking us if we wanted anything else.  I got the feeling they wanted us to finish soon. The dim sum was decent for Cleveland and would give this place 4 stars for that reason but I am subtracting a star for service."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Came in late at night and had some wonderful, made from scratch fresh food. Staff is very nice, will absolutely come back again!"}
{"text":"Solid dim sum with fast, friendly service. I was surprised with how efficient and accommodating they were to our large group. 

When someone in our group realized they wanted a dish in particular but hadn't seen in circulating in the carts, one of our waiter's would order it and bring it right out to us. 

Would definitely be back when back in this area!"}
{"text":"Dim sum in Cleveland? Meh. It was okay, not amazing.

We stopped here for lunch, after reading the reviews online. Excited that there might be a good place in the Midwest for dimsum, I got ready to eat. We ordered the first ha gao..and the skin of the dumpling was strangely sticky. It stuck to my chopsticks. I mean, the fillings were all good of the ha gao and the siu mai, etcera, but the skin of all of them? They stuck to my chopsticks. I'm not sure if maybe they just over cook the dim sum or over cook the skins or something?

The BBQ though looked good. I didn't try it. I'm not a fan of their dim sum (maybe if I went for bao...that would be safe), but I think next time I\"ll just try their dinner foods or the duck and roast pork. As most of the people inside the restaurant were Chinese.... maybe there's something in there that I missed.......because I didn't think it was that good at all...."}
{"text":"This was my first dim sum so I don't have much to compare it to but I  loved it! Everything I had was great minus the tripe but that's just personal taste. It was very crowded inside but we didn't have to wait long for a table. The service was really great as well. The only thing I didn't like was that I really didn't know what I was eating. The food was very authentic and I really didn't know much about Dim Sum. Either way, it was delicious and I hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"Growing up in Shanghai, this is in no way comparable to what I had in my hometown, but considering that this is Cleveland, I would give it a four star.

Two things I like about this place - cheap and fast. You take your seat, and then waitresses will come surround you with carts of dim sums. You pick the ones you want, and be brave to say no if they are really trying to sell you something. Then they will then mark the price on the bill that they keep on your table. You pay after you finish.

Dishes that I enjoyed: steamed pork chop, steamed chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, lotus cake, and some other dishes. Their roasted duck was only ok, not recommending. I don't usually don't order vegetables either."}
{"text":"This was my first bad experience at Li Wah. The food was OK but the service sucked. It's like we were completely forgotten after the food was served. The server never came back to ask how our food was or if we wanted anything else. Had to flag another server down to get the check."}
{"text":"Sigh, this is Cleveland so there won't be much competition when it comes to Asian breakfast. 

We stopped by on a road trip thinking that maybe this big city would have something good to eat. The restaurant opens at 10am, but the food wouldn't be ready until 11am. The staff is decently hospitable... They would be a lot better if they were proud of where they were working. You can tell how embarrassed they are that the cooks were just coming into work at 10am, and how only 30% of their menu was available on weekdays. 

The dim sum wasn't good either. Worst shrimp dumplings I've ever had and the chicken feet were too hard... Maybe they were from the other day? Wouldn't be surprised. 

Note: To enjoy a good experience here, come during the weekends. It's what we were told."}
{"text":"I love Li Wah for lunch. All the Dim Sum that I have tried has been delicious! I also like the normal Chinese plate lunches (ie, stir fry, fried rice, egg roll). 

One of the best dining experiences of my life was going to Li Wah's Chinese New Year celebration, complete with the lion dancers and multiple courses served family-style.  It was awesome, and I definitely plan on looking into going this year.

Parking isn't awesome here... A couple times, after failing to find reasonable lot or street parking, we've headed over to Bo Loong, which has more ample private parking."}
{"text":"Located in the Asian Plaza in Cleveland with huge dining space. Li Wah looks more of a authentic traditional Chinese restaurant styled in 90s. With a good menu selection and seasonal seafood choices, this place would serve most Chinese residents well. Li Wah also features authentic Cantonese Dim Sum, which really is worth a try for some. However, apparently this place still needs a bit more of sincerity and expertise in culinary skills if they want to fill up the extensive space regularly. Dim Sum items are must-have, and their Roasted Duck is good as well."}
{"text":"I expected David Lo Pan to appear as I ate my meal (villain from Big Trouble in Little China). This restaurant reminds me of his lair and I remind myself of Jack Burton (Kurt Russell). Eating dim sum is a pretty great way to wrap up the weekend on a nice quiet morning/afternoon. 

Lo Pan: And now, my beloved disciples. The moment of truth... the needle of love."}
{"text":"My neighbor, George Moy turned me on to them. I never had Chinese food so good. Fresh and tasty. The best. He brought to us. Next time I want to go there."}
{"text":"Traditional atmosphere, was pretty busy when we arrived. Drinks were great, food was average. Service could have been more prompt...worst part were the gnats,they were everywhere. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"3.5 - I'm a true believer that all great dim sum places never score above 4 stars for some reason. 

Came during CNY weekend and of course this place was PACKED. But the woman manning the front did a great job with taking names and in all actuality we only had to wait for about 15 minutes for a table. 

Standard dim sum dishes. But a notable dish is their crab ball. At many other dim sum restaurants, their balls are mostly the crispy outside, but at Li Wah, they're mostly crab!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dim sum. The service was a little slower and food selection was not huge. Also really expensive for a dim sum place.... however the food quality was relatively fresh considering Cleveland is not known for our Asian food. So if you'd like to treat yourself for some dim sum experience, i would still suggest this place."}
{"text":"Being from Columbus, my choices for dim sum locations are very limited. And being an Asian from the west coast, I've come to not have high expectations of dim sun here in Ohio. I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It's not a Tim Ho Wan by any means, but it's pretty darn good Ohio Chinese food. All the staples, eg ha cao + xiu mai, are pretty standard and what you'd expect. The BBQ pot bun (hum bao) wasn't good - meat tasted/smelled old. Jasmine tea was like 60c a person - should be this cheap or free in authentic Chinese places. The stuffed eggplant dish was my favorite - probably the best variation I've had. Despite the restaurant being pretty authentic (including a large Chinese clientele), the servers spoke pretty good English and were mostly attentive. When we asked for sticky rice, one waitress brought out both dim sum varieties for us to choose from. Food comes out fast and the carts circulate often, and we were not pressured in to ordering more food. A bit expensive for dim sum ($50 for 3 people), but we may have just ordered more than typical people as we were all stuffed by the end and couldn't finish about one small plate of food left."}
{"text":"Average in terms of dim sum. They push carts here so you get the real experience in terms of ordering your dishes. Some of the items we wanted were not on the carts so we had to request them specifically. Reasonably busy for a Saturday morning and decently priced. Overall decent dim sum."}
{"text":"Been here for dim sum and its great.  Maybe not like Hong Kong but pretty good anyway.   There are few options for dim sum in Cleveland and this place is worth visiting.  Very clean, good food and service.  Patience may be required as its authentic Chinese right down to a lot of the people who work there that don't speak much (if any) English."}
{"text":"I feel bad doing this...  I've gone to Li Wah so many times for dim sum without ever having any difficulty.  But I feel that I just have to update my review based on my last visit there.

I was there with the bf and some of his family that were visiting in town.  We went for a late night dinner (they're open until midnight!).  The staff were fabulously friendly and my visiting family were pleased with the service and the food.  So was I... until about an hour later.

I got home and developed very unpleasant GI symptoms of food poisoning.  I was in quite a bit of pain and discomfort until the middle of the next day.  Time course and symptoms all fit with food poisoning.  I always get the bugs much worse than the bf.  He had some mild discomfort as well.  The bf's father also had unpleasant GI symptoms that night.  I would have passed it off as who-knows-what... maybe I caught some bug from all the kids I work with... except that multiple members of our party had the same symptoms, all at the same time, just after eating there.

Very sad.  I had a hard time re-covering faith in restaurants after bouts of food poisoning.  We'll see... I'll probably give it another try after a period of initial avoidance.  It's only happened this once out of many times eating there... so I'll just knock 1 star off and leave the rating at a 3*, although really... one should never get food poisoning from decent restaurants.  Hygiene & proper food handling, peoples!!!

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Dim Sum is excellent and Anna is an amazing lady! This is. Very cultural feel in here. I recognize a few of the workers from the Annual Cleveland Asian Festival. I have not had lunch or dinner but I will definitely update. Hope ill be entering another notch on the ol' PAXn' belt."}
{"text":"Dim Sum... yes please. This place has it all. Authentic experience in the Asian Plaza. These guys own both Ho Wah and King Wah. Li Wah being the most authentic. I highly recommend the steam dumplings if you go the Dim Sum route. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"The first time having dim sum is a bit overwhelming. Luckily, I went with friends who've gone before. I let them do the ordering and focused on eating! 

My favorites were the shrimp balls, fried rice, broccoli and pork dumplings. 

I definitely want to go back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"What an absolutely fantastic time to check this colorful and cultural eatery out - none other than Chinese New Year itself!  Let's start this culmination of information out with a bit of advice - come early for your Dim Sum if it's CNY, for as you could imagine, the place gets jam packed!  I was fortunate (888! *the lucky numbers in Chinese) to be in a smaller group of just 3, but I can imagine for a larger group it'd be quite a wait.  We hit the spot right in time (around 10:20AM), and only waited about 5 or 10 minutes to be sat among some strangers, which was not at all an issue for us.  In fact, the little girl at our table was just killing me with her cuteness, so I suppose it was actually ideal!

Little plates and steamer baskets of tastiness are pushed around by several different servers and boy is there a variety!  Our leading lady led the way and suggested some popular dishes for our first time.  We had Har Gow (Shrimp Dumplings) the shrimp was covered in a very unique textured dumpling, and I would not describe it as slimy or unpleasant... I actually rather enjoyed the exterior.  I, unfortunately, am not crazy for shrimp, so it was not among my favorite dish.  Let it be known that this is highly recommended though, and many others without a shrimp dislike, were beyond thrilled with it.  We also tried pork dumplings, which were coated in a tofu exterior.  I absolutely adored these!  The flavor, the texture, the slight crunch when you bit into them... I could have eaten an entire small plate to myself!  We then tried Siu Mai, which was a Shrimp and Pork dumpling which are wrapped in a fresh pasta skin that is left open, allowing the fillings to peek out.  A pleasant ginger rested atop.  Very jam packed with flavor and freshness!

We followed this with the side that surely put a spring in my step!  A light and crunchy and absolutely magnificent spring roll!  Man, this was by far the best spring roll I have ever had.  Light and crunchy, flaky, and fresh cabbage resting inside... it was delectable each and every bite.  Not to mention piping hot!  Oh my - it's got my mouth watering now!

Afterwards I noticed a very fresh and plump looking bun on a cart, which was Cha Siu Bao - otherwise known as a Chinese BBQ Pork Bun!  It grabbed my attention, so of course we ordered them.  Oh how savory this little bun was.  Perfect dough to sink your teeth into, surprising your buds with a hint of sweet and a mouthful of hearty meat.  It was FILLING, in more than one way  ;)

We then tried a Dan Ta, also known as an Egg Tart.  It was a mini little crust filled with egg custard and baked to a golden perfection.  Great texture on the exterior, but a softer squishier inside, as you would imagine.  It was lightly sweet and hit the spot as a nice end of the meal dessert.  You'd think, under rational mind, the meal would have ended there, right?  NO.  This girl (me) was craving some serious greens.  We ordered Chinese Broccoli which was essentially a combination of spinach and LONG broccoli.  Say bye-bye to Broccolini - there's a new boo in town, Chinese Broccoli!  ;)

All along throughout Dim Sum we sipped on some tasty Jasmine tea with floral accents.  We also were able to watch the very entertaining Lion be fed the little envelopes (Hong Paos) with money to bring good luck!  This was a thrill of a performance, and I was wildly impressed, especially considering the tight spaces this Lion found its way through.

All in all, this location wow-ed me to the max, and will certainly have my business for future Dim Sum-ing.  I'm not sure you can just add -ings to any cultural experience, but here I am, paving my own path.  If you've never experienced a Dim Sum, this would be the ideal place to start!  SHIN NAIH KUAI LEH, LI WAH!"}
{"text":"Best dim sum I've had anywhere, great atmosphere, and unbelievably reasonable prices"}
{"text":"I am pretty sure that anyone who knows me is aware of the fact that I love to eat. And, anything Asian usually gets me going. Li Wah is one of the coolest and old school places for Dim Sum. I am not even sure where to start with what there is to eat, as everything is in strict Chinese and has some English translations, but I never know. I love the shark fin soup and while it sounds strange, it is excellent. The sesame balls, and any of the buns are a total hit. As is the crab claw and any of the noodle dishes. We usually go here on a Saturday or Sunday, and I can always count on it being packed. Get here early and be prepared for your taste buds to explode. So good. The service is good, not great. However, this can be easily overlooked with the food and how great you feel when it is over. Payne avenue may seem a bit sketchy, but this is safe area and worth the visit."}
{"text":"I recently went here for the first time in years and was pleasantly surprised. Everything I got was so delicious! I definitely think Li Wah is on par with dim sum restaurants in big cities such as NYC.

It was incredibly busy when I stopped in on a Sunday but luckily I didn't have to wait long for a table. I ordered hot tea for my family, which used to be free back then but isn't anymore. My favorite dishes I tried were the beef tripe, chicken feet, stuffed eggplant and shumai. I love dipping everything in chili oil for an extra kick. 

The only negative thing I have to say is that I wish they had more variety. It felt like I kept seeing the same dishes over and over again on the food carts. Besides that, this is the place to go for an authentic dim sum experience in Cleveland and I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Okay, here is the cold hard truth: Dim Sum in Ohio, Lower Your Expectations People.  That being said, after trying dim sum in the three big C's of Ohio, Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati, by far, Li Wah has the best tasting dim sum and the best selection, especially on Sundays.  Just by looking around the room on Sunday, you can see by the masses of Asian heads, that it is a great place considering that this is Ohio.  Honestly, you cannot expect it to taste like San Francisco or Boston or New York, and no, we do not have a Chinatown, per say, in Ohio, but this is as good as it comes.  Li Wah is connected to an indoor shopping center that has been renovated and the old grocery has been reconstructed into a nice new, larger grocery store with fresh bakery items.  Sure, it does not compare to the large meccas of the United States, but, hello, this is OHIO, get it?

I have been coming to Li Wah since I can remember and they have evolved.  Their dim sum items have expanded, their quality is much better, and they are faster at getting items out to customers and getting those carts around.  They have more cart servers who can semi-understand/speak English, which is a relief, and the waiters are more attentive than before.  The seating is a little crowded, but chairs do not end up bumping into each other, which is more than I can say for a lot of dim sum places.  The noise level is just fine, not too loud and no annoying Asian music.  They usually have sports games playing the television.

They have the usual dim sum favorites: shumai, chicken feet, bao buns, egg custard, congee, what I call \"footballs,\" etc.  I always order their chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, yum yum.  They usually have four or five different types of carts which come around several times.  Remember though, the most dim sum selection is prepared on Sunday, but get there before peak time or you will be waiting for a table.

The reason why I did not give Li Wah five stars is because sometimes the cart servers get chatty and forget to do their job.  The managers have to prod them and tell them to stop talking quite a bit in order to get the customers served and the carts around which is irking.  This problem is getting better, however, because the issue was much bigger in the past without management interference."}
{"text":"The dim sum is pretty good here. Though I have to say that the food is too greasy. They could definitely take it down a notch on the oil. The ladies there are very friendly and service is fast. Definitely worthwhile if you're in the mood for dim sum in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Looove this place..dim sum for sure yum, yum.  When I go, a friend orders a special dish \"Chow Ho Fun\", either beef or chicken.  It's not on the menu, but it is a flat rice noodle dish with just the best sauce ever!!!  Make sure to order it \"wet\".  Unless you're not one for the saucy types.

My one gripe....I know, I shouldn't be complaining. But the dim sum purveyors, are so frustrating.  I will try anything once. But I really would love to know what is in those little pillows of happiness.  A communication barrier for sure.   I may ask for a translation next time."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Came here for some dim sum. Got the bbq steam buns , shrimp/chicken shumai, shrimp wontons (? Don't remember the name of them) and an egg roll. would recommend everything but the egg roll. Overall OK experience."}
{"text":"Atmosphere- decor is just like any Chinese restaurant. It's really smelly here and its not a pleasant scent. 

Service- A 

Food- I always go here for dim sum and occasionally for dinner. It's probably the most delicious Chinese restaurant in Ohio that has decent dim sum. My advice- get everything on the carts."}
{"text":"I leave here many a Sunday afternoon high on MSG, chili oil and hot tea. As far as dim sum goes, there aren't really many other options in CLE but despite the lack of competition, this place continues to live up to its reputation. 
If you're the type of person that absolutely must know what's in everything you eat, this place is NOT for you. Every day from 12pm-2pm the dim sum carts are loaded with delicious and texturally interesting items that will delight any adventurous palette. You could, of course, order off the regular menu, but I would probably only do this if I came with a large group, since many of the dishes are made to be shared family style. 
On the whole I love coming here- I love the atmosphere, I love the food, I love the slight language barrier and having no idea what
I'm putting in my mouth, and if these are things you appreciate too, you'll love Li Wah!"}
