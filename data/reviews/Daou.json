{"text":"I tried this restaurant based on the reviews that I read about the restaurant but when I tried it .. It wasn't good at all and it's expensive for what they are serving find another lebanese restaurant if you want to try Lebanese food."}
{"text":"Phenomenal and fresh tasting food! Great customer service. The food had a rich authentic taste. Enjoyed every morsel:) Don't let the outside look of the place dissuade you, once you are inside and eat your first bite, you will be happy from that moment onwards:)"}
{"text":"Girlfriend's family took me to dinner here while I was visiting. I was impressed with the food and the fresh ingredients. Great hummus and fattoush salad. Wish I had a place like this back where I'm from."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Lebanese restaurants in different parts of the world and this is one of the best. The food, service, and atmosphere is excellent. I'm definitely returning."}
{"text":"I was planning to order from Daou for my family dinner party, and I decided to sample the food. I ordered a plate of mixed grilled meat with fries and falafel, they were both terrible...the red meat pieces and Kafta were raw inside, I came home and had to cook everything myself. The fries have seen better days, they were limp greasy and basically inedible, on top of that I found a white hair nestled inside, I threw them out. The falafel were a complete disaster, I have eaten falafel more times than I can count and those were the worst I ever had, they lacked taste and texture, I honestly did not taste the distinctive falafel taste of spices and crunchiness . I was very disappointed with this restaurant and felt cheated as I know they know what real Lebanese food should be like. The only positive thing out of this experience is that I tried the food before using them for my event. Sorry Daou but you lost me as a potential customer!"}
{"text":"My favorite Lebanese restaurant of all-time.  The food there is AUTHENTIC. It's just like my grandmother's cooking.  The ideal way to order at Daou is to order small dishes and share.   Service is amazing.  A real gem. Prepare to unbutton the top button of your pants when you leave."}
{"text":"Our cousin was coming to town and was in the mood for Lebanesefoods and no one was in the mood to cook a time consuming meal. My family is half Leb and have been coming to Daou's for a long time now. If you want authentic, fresh food in a relaxed \"home away from home\" setting, you will love Daou's.  We had reservations at 7pm on a Friday night, this place is popular with groups and loud families so it may not be the best choice if you are in the mood for a romantic tête à tête:) It was busy when we arrived, several very large groups but the noise level was in check and it was a jovial type of atmosphere.  As always, we were greeted with a friendly smile and warm hello and brought to our table.  We generally eat the same things and share it \"family style\" and ordered fatouj, baba ganouj, kibbeh, grilled shrimp, grilled marinated chicken, the filet mignon and Lebanese rice.  The baba is smoky and delicious, their fatouj fresh and crisp.  The shrimp are buttery, garlicky perfection and although I'm not always a fan of chicken, their chicken pieces are pounded thin, and the marination is beyond delicious. I've eaten it cold the next day and it is even better!  The beef is always melt in your mouth tender, perfectly cooked and beautifully marinated as well.  They also offer catering which we recently used for my mom's birthday party, truly beautifully presented food and just as amazing as it is at the restaurant. We had our usuals along with a rice, carmalized onions and grilled fish dish which became a new favorite!  We also had an artfully prepared fruit platter with beautifully carved fruit which was all in season, sweet and refreshing.  If you love Lebanese food Daou's offers an unparalleled experience your taste buds won't soon forget!"}
{"text":"Completely delicious. Hommos, vine leaves, falafel--I give them all top marks. Decor is a little dated, but that's part of its charm."}
{"text":"From the outside Daou looks a bit run down. Not so once you enter. The food is fresh. The service is professional. Don't miss the grilled meat."}
{"text":"This place is truly authentic Lebanese fare and according to the friends I just dined with; it smells like Lebanon and tastes like Lebanon haha The steak tartare \"kafta nayé\" is out of this world.  It was apparent by the fresh flavours that the tabouli salad was prepared only a few minutes after we ordered it.  My Lebanese friend states that you can judge a great Lebanese restaurant by its tabouli and this one is as authentic as they make with fresh Italian parsley and abundance of herbs, tomatoes and lemon (many places cload it with wheat bulgur and not the right amount of parsley; that method is not Lebanese but more Egyptian or other countries calling it taboule; might as well call it a couscous salad, Daou has the real thing)  The grilled meats were wow factor; especially the sheesh kabob which has some of the  leanest sirloin cubes I have had in a restaurant for a while.  We finished off with dessert; lebanese crepe filled with ricotta style cheese and rose water drizzle; mmmmgood the Lebanese espresso coffee was perfect to end the meal.  Bring your appetite and Come in your gym sweat pants or prepare to unbuckle your belt as you will need it!  Too bad grandma wasn't around to read the lines left at the bottom of the coffee cup; next time."}
{"text":"Food is top notch. All the meat items appear to be well cooked, if perhaps a tad over-cooked. But I was looking for a sampler platter for Vegetarian food. It came with so much food, I was trying to serve everyone else, who also had too much food. The hummus and falafel were certainly sit-down restaurant worthy. The odd thing about this place and many middle eastern places in the middle East is the obsession with French Fries. All the chicken dishes come with traditional white rice and a serving of french fries. Where did this trend develop?  Service was decent, but because the restaurant was full and a group of teenagers walked in shortly after we ordered, we were not extremely well-attended to.  The other reviews about this not being unique food, are all true. I like the basics, but I have had better at a couple other places around the world."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times have just been meh. Lebanese restaurant with a variety of options however the food is just average. Being of Middle Eastern descent, I've had phenomenal Lebanese food in my life, and this is no where near phenomenal (or even good really).  I wouldn't really come here unless I had to - there are lots of other great places in the city for you to check out!"}
{"text":"I was really please with the service, the atmosphere and of course the food. However for very little more money, I have had better."}
{"text":"I am so confused by the high ratings here... perhaps I came on an off day? Maybe it's because I'm Middle Eastern and have certain standards when it comes to my region's fare? All I know is that the lunch I just had could be summed up with a giant \"meh\"/turn-y hand gesture.   We ordered two dishes. The first was the day's special, which consisted of a plate of rice mixed with minced meat and topped with chicken and pine nuts. The rice mixture was fine but the chicken was soooo dry and totally tasteless. It came with a side salad that was adequately dressed but pretty sad-looking all around. Our second dish was the kafta plate (minced meat formed into pipe-shaped burgers) with fries (it was between that or more rice). The kafta was sort of flavourful but again, very very dry. The fries were fine but I would have honestly preferred a salad to go with it (they wouldn't allow for substitutions).   On the whole, the level of food we got simply could not justify the prices listed on the menu. I have no doubt that a lot of love goes into this place, but at $20 a plate for something I swear is done better by (insert name of fast-food Lebanese restaurant), I just can't justify coming here. I'm really not trying to be mean or dismissive, just honest. It's not as if the ambiance or service validates that sort of premium either.  Lunch did end on a somewhat positive note thankfully with dessert and coffee. Our kadaif was to die for and our coffee came with the perfect consistency for fortune telling!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for the right moment to try this place, family occasion or birthday, but it never came. So I decided to try it solo.  This place is always empty whenever I pass by, there used to be a lot of people from the Middle East in this area, but it looks like most have moved on. So the businesses suffer a bit. It doesn't help that Amir's and Basha's have \"Mcdonalized\" this cuisine, so people are wary of paying more.  As I looked at the menu, most items are just too expensive. I know this is not Amir, but what I had cost $25. everything else was just about 30-40% higher than elsewhere  like Petit Alep or Kaza Maza   It was a plate with a Kefta Kebab, Chicken cutlet (Taouk) and Filet Mignon brochette. With a little bit of rice and nothing else but a couple of onions. The taste was ok, but the meats lacked flavor and the filet mignon was chewy and mushy.  A grilled tomato would have helped somewhat as well as wrapping the meats with pita bread, where the juices would drip.  No soup or salad, with a glass of wine, that's close to $40 dollars with tip.  The menu is so large, I doubt it can all be fresh, they don't have a table d'hote menu or a lunch special, This would offer more to the customer and emphasizes something that might be freshly made.  The service was a bit distant, the waiter seemed stunned when I asked for sumac. And as I was leaving, I noticed an elderly woman, either working or related to the owners, sitting with her hands on her face, almost crying.   I would go back with a larger group to try a bigger variety of items, I want to encourage places like these. When you compare it to Petit Alep, which is packed,  I get the feeling they could really improve by doing some tweaking."}
{"text":"Deep within the bleak and depressing hinterland of Marcel-Laurin boulevard lies this understated mecca to Lebanese food. The food is prepared simply yet perfectly with a well honed confidence.  They don't just serve chicken. They serve amongst the BEST chicken you will ever have. The filet mignon shish kebab (get it medium rare) is good enough to make you cry. The same with the kefta. Their food makes you feel like you've been ripped off by every other Lebanese restaurant in town. I don't know how I am supposed to ever go back to Basha, Amir, or even the mighty Boustan after eating at Daou.  The fattouch salad and hummus with pine nuts to start were both excellent. The falafel salad however, is in a league of its own. The falafel balls are served hot with a crispy exterior and soft and moist interior. Topped with tahini, tabouleh, tomatoes, turnips, and peppers, this dish transports you to a place far away (ever farther than Ville St. Laurent!) This falafel obliterates all others in the city. Again, Daou has managed to ruin every other falafel I might have elsewhere in the future.  I look around the restaurant and see families from all backgrounds; Indian, African, Lebanese, Italian, Jewish. People who have all undertaken a pilgrimage to get their fix. Every time a slice of birthday cake is served, the restaurant starts blasting this cheesy happy birthday-like song on the speakers causing everybody to start singing and clapping. It's one of those unique old school experiences that reminds me of Chi-Chi's happy birthday song in the 80s. Paired with a standard but excellent chocolate layer cake, there are few better ways to spend a rainy Sunday night.  Prices are just slightly elevated but considering the quality of food, they are entirely justified. Daou is still priced well below a trendy place like Damas which wildly overcharges for what is essentially humble food.   Service was a little slow, but they get a pass on a holiday weekend in Quebec. Scratch that. With food like this, they could hypothetically curse at me and keep me waiting for hours like an animal. It wouldn't diminish my admiration for their works of art on a plate."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good place. Tonight was the second time I've eaten there in the last two weeks. It was packed to the brim with noisy people having a good time, and the food I was served was very good.  When I sat down, they put some pita in front of me, and some beet-marinated turnip and olives. Nice touch, and kept me going until I was served.  Service was a bit slow, but the place is very big and every single table was taken excepted the one I got. That ought to tell you something. (Next time I'll come on a different night. Saturday prime time will be packed. It's popular, it seems. Deservedly so.)"}
{"text":"+1 star for the delicious French fries and +1 star for the kind service, and that's about it.  I come from a place where Lebanese food is commonplace?; in comparison, this place is below average. Definitely do not get the lamb chops; the meat was soooo tough and perhaps old. Get anything else.  As for appetizers, the walnut based dip and the hummus tahini were decent, but don't get the baba ganouj as it was bland and didn't taste fresh.  It's too bad, I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. I had the hors d'oeuvre viande and everything was very tasty. The dolmades (they call them 'vines') were tight and fresh-tasting -- if I was ordering a main they'd make an excellent appetizer. The kebba was delicately spiced, and the falafel was spectacular.   I had a nice chat with the owner on exiting -- she and two sisters emigrated from Lebanon in '75. They bring a really authentic and pleasant dining experience to the area."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about my visit to Daou. If I could, I would give it 3.5*. The restaurant itself is blah and old looking from the inside & outside. The service was good but on the slow side.  Because Daou was so hyped up to me, I think I was more disappointed than I would have been if I stumbled on this place randomly. We ordered many plates to share so that we could try a larger portion of the menu.  The fattoush was bland and definitely not what I expect from fattoush, while the hummus with pine nuts didn't have any olive oil on it which I've never seen Lebanese hummus served that way. The cheese cigars were delicious but TINY in size. The stuffed vine leaves with meat were rolled really tightly and were actually yummy so these 2 appetizers were my faves.  We also got the falafel zehlawa, which is essentially 4 falafel balls topped with tomatoes, turnips, hot peppers and tahini sauce. It was good but again nothing mind blowing. The grilled meats plate with chicken, kafta and filet mignon pieces was yummy but not worth the price.   The best part was dessert, I loved the katayef stuffed with cream and pistachios covered in rose water syrup. I wouldn't go back because it's far from me and I wayyyy prefer Garage Beirut downtown for authentic Lebanese food."}
{"text":"This is the class of the field in Montreal when it comes to Lebanese Style Middle Eastern food.  Last week I was there with 3 other diners for a celebratory dinner. Please make sure you bring your appetites, as portions are generous.  Knowing about the size of the portions, we began with an appetizer of pepper and cheese did with deliciously fresh pitas.  The following main course were ordered: Grilled quails with french fries These were delicious, moist and very tasty  Fillet migon brochettes Nicely charbroiled, moist and tasty.  Grilled chicken breasts Very well spiced, juicy and delicious  Kebbah Nayeh This is the lebanese version of Steak Tartar, which is served with raw onions, mint and olive oil. It was perfect  All these were accompanied by rice and french fries which are outstanding.  For dessert I ordered a mehallabiyeh which is served with a cruet of rose water syrup, and other diners ordered turkish coffee.  Its head and shoulders above the average lebanese fare, and is well worth a visit.  While you are there, if you want to be transported to the 60's drive behind the restaurant and marvel at the Motel Pierre situated around a court yard.....so tacky...they don't make motels like that anymore."}
{"text":"This is a great place for large groups for good and honest Lebanese food.  Makes for a great Sunday afternoon lunch, Monday-Wednesday dinner.  Good, classic and a must visit at least once."}
{"text":"Not good enough as I expected, but the grilled mutton is tender and delicious. Service is so so. Price is a little higher than other kabab restaurants."}
{"text":"Visually this restaurant looks unimpressive from the outside. The parking lot looks run down and dirty, it's located right beside a roach motel and the exterior facade of the restaurant gives possible clients driving by absolutely no idea what type of cuisine they offer which is a damn shame because this place has probably offers close to the best Lebanese food in the city.  5 STARS.  Really? Why?  Firstly, this place turned me into a falafel freak. The falafel in this place is the absolute best, BAR NONE! They are always fresh, fried 'just right' and come with the best tahini/lemon sauce ever. I've had their falafel in a pita as well as a side dish with vegetables and it's always been the highlight of my meal. I've brought friends from other origins (French, Italian, Greek) and they have always been amazed by the quality falafel. My mouth waters craving their falafel at the THOUGHT OF IT.  The fattoush salad is exceptional as well. Normally, I'm not a huge fattoush salad lover, my wife is and I've tried it here and it's perfect. I can't help but eat more and more of this salad every visit while I barely touch it elsewhere.  The hummus is also particularly good as well. With the free fresh pita they provide this makes a great appetizer. It's tasty and tangy and goes down smooth. Be careful to not fill yourself up with this!  Other things I've tried :  The cheese rolls as well as the vine leaves are very average in comparison. We rarely order these. Next few visits we'll try other stuff.  One thing folks will order is from their meat selection. Restaurant Daou has a variety of selection of meats such as kebab, chicken and filet mignon which are very expensive due to their low value. While they are tasty and well done but the portions are ridiculously small compared to the price you pay. For example their huge meat variety plate is priced around $25 and it only has 1 kebab, 4 pieces of filet mignon and a chicken breast with some side fries. This meal is good but is it worth $25? I think not.  Make sure to shop for your items wisely.  We're particularly fond of the Lebanese coffee as well as the Lebanese crepe stuffed with ricotta. They are very good but may not be for everyone.  The service has never failed me. They are quick and eager to help. Thoughtful and helpful and you'll never find yourself running after them.  The price. Let's just say, if you're going here for a full meal and you order the overrated meats, expect to pay close to $100 for 2 people. If you shop well and try a variety of appetizers, the delicious falafel and dessert selections, you can pay far less, somewhere around $60 or so for 2 people.  I spoke of the decor on the outside but on the inside it is clean and warmly decorated. You'll have no problem feeling comfortable while having your meal. I've seen this place busy but never full, which is a shame because the quality is definitely there.  The power is in your OWN HANDS!  I recommend this place to anyone!  Will visit again."}
{"text":"Solid, if uninspired Lebanese food. They serve all of the basics, but seem to be riding on their reputation. Nothing is bad, but it is not great. The service is not that friendly and interior is pretty tacky (chrome plated stacking chairs)."}
{"text":"Authentic Lebanese food never tasted any better. The service is great and the food is even greater.  Whether you're dining with your spouse or with a large group, the outcome is always great.  I definitely recommend Daou for your Lebanese fix!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Restaurant Daou in ages. So we all gathered and brought the whole family there. We had the Fattouch salad, falafel zehlaweh, vegetarian vine leaves, baba Ghanoug (eggplant puree) & hummus. All the entrées were delicious but la pièce de resistance was a dish called Syadieh with rice cooked in home made fish broth perfumed with different spices, nuts, tilapia fish and onion confit. You don't go to this restaurant for its decor but for the delicious authentic Lebanese food. Great staff, the owners are very friendly. The price is a bit high but worth it for the quality offered. There is a slight chance that you meet the René Angelil or Dion family eating there. An overall great experience. As a expatriot I truly know what I am talking about"}
{"text":"Very few good Lebanese restaurants with such good quality. I see the prices are fair enough yet some ppl can find them a little bit expensive specially for the appetisers but only one is enough. Had the grill plate which taste so good. i advice to try the arak drink too and finish your meal with atayef, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm a falafel freak and Daou has one of the best falafel in pita in the city. The falafel balls are always fresh and the whole thing has a great tahini/lemon flavor. It's a big sandwich and I usually order it to go as a whole meal. I'm a vegetarian (they also have fab fatoush and taboule salad) but I when I've brought meat lovers there they are happy.  I've been going there for a good 15 years. Be warned that it is a bit noisy if you eat there and there are lots of people - but the food is fab."}
{"text":"We arrived without making reservation to an empty restaurant that got filled really quickly on a Saturday evening. Lot's of families.  We wanted a window table but the owner couldn't give it to us cause they were all for four or more and she was anxious knowing he many made reservations for that eve. The service is hot and miss. We had one pretty apathetic waiter at the beginning and a lovely pleasant one when we ordered the dessert. The restaurant is not well maintained - with lol of a cheap wedding hall and washroom who've seen better days. The food: great fresh fatoush salad, fantastic hummus with pine nuts (snobar), kibbeh was just ok (though fried to order). The desert was amazing - big portion of Atayef - sweet soft sweetened cheese wrapped with thin crape flavoured with pistachio and rose water. That's alone was worth the visit. My partner who is not versed with middle eastern food loved the hummus and the Atayef. We will come back."}
{"text":"My family is  Iraqi and the food is just like cooking at home. It is so good and great for large groups!  The meat and chicken are always fresh."}
{"text":"Standard, good Middle-Eastern food.  My date described the server as being \"le serveur qui nous a bien fait rire\".  I really felt for the guy because I understood that he wasn't clueless out of any bad emotion."}
{"text":"I came here wit my colleagues. It's definitely more of family restaurant. I am by no means an expert on Lebanese food but I liked it. The service was fast at first but then it did take awhile for the grilled meats to come.    I tried the Lebanese beer, Almaza, for the first time. It was good... very light. We started with the fattouche which is basically a lettuce salad with grilled pita. It was good but nothing too impressive. We also ordered the taboulé but I didn't try it because I'm not a fan of that much parsley on a plate. The regular  hummus and hummus hachoui were very good.  It was my first time having the latter. I liked the mix of hummus with minced meat. Also I don't usually like babaghanouj but this one was very good! I had at least three servings of it! Next we had the habra nayeh which is basically raw minced meat. It was a bit bland on its own but it came with onion and mint on the side.  I thought it was weird that they chopped an onion in half n just gave it to us like that to eat. I figured they would have cut it up in little pieces and put it on top of the meat.  I mixed the raw meat with hummus , babaghanouj and olive oil and it made it better. I didn't eat the yabrak siameh (cold vegetarian vine leaves) because there was already so much food on the table and I've tried the Greek one before and didn't really like it all that much. I did try the warm one with meat inside. It was OK. Besides the babaghanouj, my favorite thing was the falafel with Tahini sauce. However, my Syrian colleague didn't like it for the same reasons that I did like it....it was very grainy. Apparently it's not supposed to be like that and I've had falafel at sumac and panthere vert so I knew it wasn't supposed to be like that but I really liked the taste and the texture. The one I had at sumac was very hard and I didn't enjoy it but this was the opposite. Lastly we had the grilled meats. I wasn't impressed with the chicken. It was hard and not juicy. The shish kebab was good thought and the kefta kebab was OK. Our sides consisted of rice, fries, and pita bread so there was something for everyone."}
{"text":"Very good libanese restaurant. You can't go there and not take their humus, babaganoush, fatouch and their shish  taouk combined with the filet mignon is just exquisite."}
{"text":"Been here many times and the food is excellent. Very authentic and really good. But visually it is horrible. Very run down and was left in the 1970's and never updated. The parking lots has tons of potholes and the place looks dumpy. Time to renovate !!!!!"}
{"text":"Food and service are great...a lots of flavors in your mouth. You go there for the food and not for the decoration, it may need to be renovated a little bit but I guess it's the charm of the place. A bit expensive though but I will go back again..."}
{"text":"A dear friend of mine lost his mother many years ago, when he was quite young. To help his family cope with such a staggering loss, he promised to help more around the house, and even to help cook -- except that he didn't know how. So, the first night he had to make dinner, he called up his favorite restaurant and asked for a recipe. To this day, everyone who's been to Daou says his hummus tastes just like the hummus they make here.  That incredible story says several things about this gem of a restaurant. They are run by a compassionate, generous family. Their food is the best in the area (and in Arab-heavy Montreal, that's really saying something!) And dining there is an experience you will remember for a long time.  We came here with said friend, who still counts it as his favorite and took us on a tour of their menu. Since we were there during Lent, we only ate their vegetarian dishes, but I can honestly say I hardly missed the meat and dairy options; everything was absolutely delicious. Their baba ganouj was my favorite (we have a photo of another friend literally licking the plate it came on!) but we also enjoyed their hummus, sauteed chicory, fattoush, tabouli, spinach pie, falafel and even the French fries with tahini sauce. The only dish I didn't care for was the stewed beans -- the flavor just wasn't my favorite, though they were cooked well. Of course everything came with piles and piles of pita and little dishes of pickled turnips and bitter green olives. Oh, it was such a fantastic meal!  I hope to return someday: not just to Montreal, but to Daou. I don't think I can give five stars without trying their kibbeh, labneh and knafe -- three of my favorite Middle Eastern dishes. I have a feeling they will step up to the challenge!"}
