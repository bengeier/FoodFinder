{"text":"I'm Persian myself, Their food is always cold... and i'm sure they preheat that before giving to customer! 
I dont recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"What a great place, food were excellent, device was flawless, we really enjoy it very much entertainment were awesome we definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have good food and great service with fabulous atmosphere   you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food , amazing live music Friday & Saturday nights . They have recently increased the price which is still a good value for an all you can eat buffet."}
{"text":"We had our baby shower at persian palace and loved everything about it.. from inside decor to food and staff! It was just perfect. It was also very affordable. I don't know why the reviews are not all amazing. All our guests really enjoyed the food, service and ambience. thank you!"}
{"text":"I came here with 5 of my non-Iranian friends to show them what Persian food is like. We went for the 9-10pm all you can eat buffet. They told us we are welcome to come earlier but 9pm is when tables will get called to go get their food. We arrived 10 minutes before 9 so as a result, we were the last table there. However, 10:15pm rolls around and we have yet to be called to go get our food! I go speak to a server to see what's going on, and they said we have to wait since everything is finished and they are making more food! I then also noticed that there are only 3 dishes and one salad at this buffet. Are you kidding me?! I'm paying $40 for just 3 dishes and an hour and a half wait??! I can go to Jerusalem Restaurant and have a huge variety of food and not have to wait to get called. We were so hungry that we just ate whatever was left over in the dishes and they were cold. Eventually when the food was cooked and brought to our table, they brought the kabob with NO RICE. They just brought pita bread with it. Either way, we were pretty full and unsatisfied. The manager wasn't being apologetic and thought just bringing the food to our table was good enough. He only reduced our bill to 4 orders instead of 6. Still for the price we paid, the service was terrible, and the wait is insanely long. I will never go back, I am very embarrassed and disappointed."}
{"text":"Persian palace management needs to take a lesson in customer service. I contacted the manager to make a reservation for private birthday party of 20. The manager was not only rude to me, instead of checking whether I was willing to pay the price to book the banquet hall that takes 40 people she just assumed I wasn't going to pay the price and decided on her own she said I cannot afford the cost. I'm highly disappointed that their management is so unprofessional by the way their food isn't that great anyway. There are a lot of other iranian restaurants that have fantastic service and really good food like Shishlix."}
{"text":"Dont judge a book by its cover they say but for this place you have too! Yes the place might look all fancy and cozy but the food/staff are horrible! Ive given this place 3 chances and each time i regret it even more! I can not stand their dry and uncooked food."}
{"text":"Great venue
High class decoration inside
External appearance is average
Good presentation of food
Fair price
Lots of rice to come with"}
{"text":"Their hours are listed incorrectly, I called them and the lady that answered said they are already closed.

I don't understand why businesses lie about their hours here on Yelp."}
{"text":"Went with friends, amazing dinning area. Food was delicious, interior of the restaurant is marvellous. Must try place in GTA"}
{"text":"It's an amazing place. Splendid design, it's so fancy
The service was above and beyond. Our server was so nice and professional 
The food was so good. I had chicken kebab that had been well marinated.
I love the place, definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful Christmas Day dinner with 10 people and all coming in at different times. I didn't know this place before, we were really looking for a place to eat on Christmas Day and was so glad to have found this one. Food and service was excellent, I highly recommend it and will be back again."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the place has a nice wow factor to it. The ambiance is nice. One of wife's friends took us out for dinner this past weekend with our kids. We let them order as we're not familiar with Persian food. The kabobs of meat were great! Very tasty and moist. I have taken notice of a drink they have it's a carbonated yogurt drink. The more I drank the more I started to take in to its unique flavours. Wifey was not fond of the drink the pre meal edibles was also not everyone in our family. I didn't mind it as I just love food. I would have not known about this place if it wasn't for our friends. I highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Food was really great! Totally worth the price. (We spent 70$ for two, including a drink and tip). The design of the location is very beautiful and unique. I strongly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Attended a formal dress party in celebration of my friends new album release.  

Immediately upon entering the beautiful decor it goes without saying is consistent throughout this beautiful establishment.  

Music and sound were good I couldn't see any issue.  

The meal was for a large group it was in a buffet style and consisted of a mixture of Persian and North American.  The Persian food was decent but the north American was mediocre to say the least.  

Service was ok but not the fastest.  No price list for drinks provided per table - cash bar."}
{"text":"Honestly, The Persian Palace is beautifully designed. Truly lovely, but honestly being Iranian I've had much better food. In my opinion the only reason this place is so popular is because there isn't really an Iranian restaurant around richmond hill thats this big so obviously people will be raving about it. Their food is meh, its not bad, but its not the best. There are much smaller joints around the city with tastier food."}
{"text":"The whole restaurant was gorgeous and the food was amazing! For such an extravagant looking restaurant, the prices on the lunch menu were pretty decent. I really enjoyed the ghormeh sabzi! The only downside to Persian Palace would have to be the weird elevator/musical rendition of old '90s classics music playing in the background. It made things a bit awkward between myself and my boyfriend as we were waiting on our food. Other than that, I would definitely come back to eat at The Persian Palace again!"}
{"text":"Don't let the grand entrance to this place fool you! Even the interior is nicely put together but its too bad the rest doesn't follow suit. I was really disappointed after the first visit. The staff and owners need to learn a lot about Customer Service!! My family and I had made reservations there to dine and celebrate a birthday. Unfortunately they failed to give us our previously arranged seating area and were very rude about it. We actually got up and left. I have heard that the food is not the greatest anyway. This is a big shame particularly for the serious Persian chefs and restaurant owners who are known for their amazing hospitality and business ethics."}
{"text":"Decor is elegant. 
That's about it.
Service is very slow although polite. 
All food is like warm. Suspect it's all microwaved as few dishes had hot spots."}
{"text":"Came for lunch for my dad's birthday. Great lunch menu, good prices, very good quality persian food in a beautiful setting. The outside of the place looks a little intimidating and weird as it is attached to the Travellodge, but inside is goegeous!!! Try the Mirza Ghasemi,  an eggplant appetizer that is to die for. The rice and stew options are delicious and remind me of my mom's cooking."}
{"text":"Tip for vegetarians/vegans: if you're coming here make sure you order off the menu (a la carte). We came as a part of a group and ate at the buffet. They had vegetarian pasta, rice, grilled tomato, and salad as the only vegetarian options. Where are the stews??! Why am I going to a Persian restaurant to eat awful pasta? I would give 0/5 if I could. VERY DISAPPOINTING."}
{"text":"Been to the palace for three times now. An \"okay\" below average place with over the top decorations!

Starting with the smart and elegant design, this is truly a Persian palace, starting from the entrance door, the statues, the wall moulding, chandeliers, everything screams elegance..all this sets the mood for a great meal! Unfortunately not!

Considering the numerous competition 'Persian restaurants' in the area, they should do much better in terms of food quality...considering they have a head-start to everybody with this beautiful setup!

Food and service are mediocre, not bad, but nothing that would invite you back.
I have asked for the manager on all my three visits, but he or she is always absent. That certainly affects the service quality as well.

Too bad the food quality and service do not match the gorgeousness of the place!"}
