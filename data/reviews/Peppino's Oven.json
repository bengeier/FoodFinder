{"text":"Great food and service! Had the Chicken Pesto Pizza, it was great! Lots of fresh toppings and looks like a lot is made from scratch, went there for a lunch meeting on a Friday and it was packed. A wide variety of menu items, but would recommend the pizza!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting, this time for lunch.  OMG what a difference and not in a positive way.  I asked for a sandwich and a pint which I enjoyed.    After I paid at the counter,   I noticed a specials tent, for you guessed it a sandwich and a pint of beer. (approx $4 less)  When, I pointed it out, she said nothing, made no apologies and silently returned the difference.  I hate being ripped off and felt this us exactly what was being attempted.  Needless to say for a mere $4 they have lost my business forever.  (This was a few months ago)"}
{"text":"After hearing my brother talk up Peppino's so much I decided to try. Its a little place in a strip plaza off of third line in Oakville.  We had a thin crust pizza with artichokes, black olives and prosciutto. It was really good pizza - i'd defiantely try it again  we also had a appetizer - peppers stuffed with ricotta and some other things- it wasn't so good. peppino's still gets 4 starts for good pizza. try it!!"}
{"text":"Stay away, pizza not even fully cooked, poor beer selection, must pay at counter for credit cards, very young staff and some shady bar regulars!"}
{"text":"This is a great little pasta and pizza cafe located near the big indoor soccer facilities south of Dundas in Oakville. The decor is a bit bizarre: half of the restaurant looks like Italy, the other half looks like Jack Astors (a bar, sports jerseys, TVs, etc).  As soon as you walk in, it smells spicy and delcious.   I wasn't that hungry and ended up just ordering a cappucino and a salad, but my mom ordered a small vegetarian pizza and my brother, a huge pepperoni calzone. Both of them loved their dishes.The pizza is a good medium thickness crust and had lots of toppings. The calzone was massive and covered in tomato sauce/parmesan. Everything is apparently made in house with homemade tomato sauce. They also serve a lot of different homemade pasta dishes, which looked pretty tasty. The salad is quite big, and topped with sunflower seeds, mandarin oranges and raspberry dressing."}
{"text":"8pm on a Saturday night.  Very busy with big groups and families.  Very noisy.   Checkered plastic tablecloths remind me of East Side Mario's.  Seated quickly and got drinks right away.  Ordered 15\" half veg half pepperoni, capicola, asiago cheese pizza.  Good pizza, definitely worth a trip back'"}
{"text":"Warm cozy atmosphere, excellent service and great value. Pizza is delicious and we have had nothing but exceptional service."}
{"text":"Not a place you'd travel from Scarborough for but if this place is in your backyard, you could do worse to have a no-nonsense pizza and sport themed pub with an Italian twist. The pizza is reasonably priced and the sauce is solid. My GF is Singaporean and likes stuff on the spicier side so when she asked for some hot sauce they brought her both Franks and their own home brewed hot sauce. It really says something about who's in the kitchen. And I think lends support to the other poster's conjecture that their pizza sauce isn't something out of a can.  A few nice twists. If I read it correctly they have Moretti on tap. And fans of classic arcade gaming will be delighted to find an arcade machine with about a dozen classic games built in, from Space Invaders to Missile Command. The game also renders the vector classics like Asteroids and Battle Zone."}
{"text":"I think they have a bunch of teenagers working there, we ordered the gnocchi and calzone. The gnocchi came out cold and flavourless, and very small portion. My boyfriend asked to make the calzone with mozzarella instead of ricotta, and they filled it with ricotta anyway and no mozzarella, they also bunched the pepperoni in one spot inside the calzone, like piled 10 pieces all together. We live close but would never eat there again."}
{"text":"good food, good prices, good opening times  (open late).   The waitress was a bit rude and abrasive."}
{"text":"A pizza joint that turns out classic pub fare. It wants to be a sports pub with different sports banners hanging from the rafters but lacks the appeal to watch a game with only two tvs. Very un assuming from the outside across the street from an old folks home, it has a gery cozy interior. The pizza is made fresh to order and is top quality. A nice kittle hidden gem. If you live in yhe area, its well worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place has 4 stars? It's pretty much East Side Marios. The garlic bread had no garlic on it. And the most important ingredient in italian food (the sauce) was flavorless...in both the gnocchi and fettuccini alfredo."}
{"text":"Decent pizza with decent prices.  This place feels like a Boston pizza sport bar theme but more of a local spot with friendly service.  Service was good although they were not very busy.  They had a good amount of other options other then pizza but pizza is the star."}
{"text":"Pizza here was not good and the kitchen also messed up our order. Luckily our waitress was a lovely girl - she made this experience not totally wasted."}
