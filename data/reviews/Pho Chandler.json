{"text":"Authentic fare, wonderfully prepared. Everybody is friendly and polite. We ordered pho and spring rolls and they were excellent. We want to go back and try some other selections."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. They have very good Vietnamese coffee. I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"Service was quick and great. Food was delicious! I had vermicelli B3, hubby had soup P9 with crab and tofu. Both very impressed with taste, quickness and price. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"We go here about once a week. The food is constantly good and everyone is friendly. .. We love this place."}
{"text":"This place is pho nominal!  Been back to this place over and over, and never disappointed.  My favorites are the spring rolls, green beans, and house pho.  All three are a must try!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The seafood pho was absolutely delicious! I came here with my wife and mother in law on a Sunday evening. The service was great they were very fast and attentive. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great pho, awesome spring rolls, prompt & courteous service. Would recommend! 

We came in on a busy Saturday but we promptly seated, greeted & beverage order taken. We started with spring rolls (with shrimp & pork)  and these were delicious! I've had a lot of spring rolls but these were something!! 

Next came pho. I got the veggie (added tofu) pho & hubby got the chicken pho. Both had wonderful flavor. The vegetables were perfect in texture & the same with the tofu. Lightly fried to remain firm in the broth. Chicken pho was yummy & chicken wasn't gristle or chewy and fatty.  Very good. 

The service was awesome. Very friendly. Would definitely come back & recommend if you're wanting some delicious pho."}
{"text":"First, I must say I don't usually write reviews but I definitely will here.  

The Pho is amazing and I love it so much.  I should have given this review for the pho a long time ago, but anyway....I always get the P11. Mì Hoành Thánh - Wonton Noodle Soup - $8.25 but substitute the thinner rice noodle for the thicker spaghetti type noodle.  It is so good and my favorite.  Yummers!!!!   I can't try anything else because this is just so good that I can't think anything is better so I won't try anything else.  

I went there last night and got my usual and I was a bit emotional because I recently lost my husband (I know this is not a great subject for a restaurant review, but it is what it is.)  I can't tell you how caring and lovely all the staff ( I hate that word) were.  They offered to give me my meal on them, which isn't what I wanted, but they insisted.  But it was more than that, they were the most caring lovely group of wonderful people and it made my pho, which is always amazing, seem just that much more delicious and fantastic.  So, thank you to them for more than just an amazing pho...but for also giving me a pho that came with love."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say! Took my kids for Pho for the first time and they loved it! I had the vegetable pho, my daughter, the traditional beef pho, and my son, the absolutely dynamite seafood pho. All of the side veggies were fresh and added a whole other dimension to our meal. The service was excellent and the prices are so inexpensive it's a real value! We will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food and quick friendly service. Went for lunch - the portions were large enough to ensure Pho for dinner too!"}
{"text":"Ordered a xl chicken pho and barely got any chicken it was basically a ton of noodles.. And it was very bland as well, I wouldn't come back. The service was very good though so there's that."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and price.  Always busy for a reason.  Yummy Pho!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Family owned business.  We have yet to be disappointed.  The prices are reasonable, and the portions just as reasonable.  We always enjoy ourselves and have gotten to know the staff -all of them are great.  Our usual hostess is single BTW.  Ask her out on a date.  Tell her the guy who drinks Vietnamese iced coffee late at night suggested it (and it is delicious BTW)."}
{"text":"Probably best  Pho in Phoenix. It beats Davang. Nam Sao, Avira, etc. Very close to Pho 43th at its best.
Unlike typical Vietnamese in PHoenix, which run down decoration. This place is new and clean. Staffs are young and work hard. They are very busy too. Wish it closer to my home."}
{"text":"Simply the best Vietnamese food in the Phoenix metro area! A tad difficult to find, but worth the extra time. While the Pho is slightly above average - everything else we have tried there is to die for. Excellent service, extremely clean and food bursting with flavor...what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great for the Valley - clean restaurant, food is tasty, relatively well priced.  For south Chandler, it is the pho place around, and so for the convenience to my house, family friendly, large portions, friendly service and staff, I give it a 5."}
{"text":"Veggie spring rolls, vegetable pho, any noodle, stir fry and rice can be made vegetarian here with tofu and lots of veggies. But this is one of my go to places for vegetable pho and Vietnamese vegetarian spring rolls in Chandler!!

This place sometimes gets packed but they are pretty quick about getting people in, served and out !"}
{"text":"I don't like the attitude from the Server/manager (Thao), she is not so friendly.

We were there to have lunch but we being treated like we are some kind of burden.
I understand it is rush hour at lunch time but that is not how you treated your customer!
The food is ok. 
But customer service is my big big thing.

Won't come back."}
{"text":"My review will be bias because the only things I ever get here are fried spring rolls and Pho. oh, and Thai iced tea. The reason for that is because I want to have that place I go to for Pho specifically. Being from CA and having had the best Pho in little Saigon, I know a good place from a sucky place! This place is great! The restaurant is clean and nice, though that is not a factor in my review. It's just a note for those foodies that require clean and nice before eating at an establishment. The staff is always kind and friendly, though again, not a factor in my review. I do love to see \"our server\" every time we go. 

The veggie Pho is packed with yummy fresh vegetables, the chicken Pho tastes fresh all the time, and the brisket is not as fatty or chewy as other restaurants in the Valley...and trust me, my boyfriend and I have visited just about every restaurant that serves Pho (but really shouldn't.)

Google maps sometimes routes me to an empty lot, just go to the home depot and you'll see it tucked to the side of that parking lot. They have televisions on, at a decent volume and it's usually something good like Dateline or some major sporting event. I love driving out to this place when time allows."}
{"text":"Awesome! If you are going for lunch, get there before noon or you'll have to wait in line.. Get the P10 and hot if you want to clear your sinus's. It's delicious.."}
{"text":"I tried Pho Chandler and I love it! The service is great, the food is awesome, and the price is so cheap. I go there at least a handful of times each month."}
{"text":"If you have the time to sit down, this is it. The menu is vast. Although it didn't take but a minute to pick. P10. Amazing. Next time I'll get it as hot as they're willing to make it. I ordered mine 4/5 on the hot scale. I like spicy food. It could've been hotter. Great service, great food and great prices."}
{"text":"Superb Pho here. Consistently good broths brimming with flavor and generous amounts of cilantro and scallions to delight the taste buds. I like that the basil and bean sprouts are served crispy and fresh. Really nice, friendly staff that is attentive and helpful. Really enjoy coming here. The icing on the cake would be if they did bubble teas too! Haven't found any place in the valley that does them well..."}
{"text":"I had the green curry chicken with rice.  Very yummy.  Portions were large enough to take some home.  We went late for lunch but early for dinner so it wasn't busy.  The veggies were  very fresh and you can order things as spicy as you like.  I like it pretty hot but not ridiculous so I ordered a 4 out of 5 and it got my attention but didn't burn my buds.  It was perfect for me, but if you think Taco Bell has spicy food you better order a 1.

I will go back again, they have many more dishes I would like to try."}
{"text":"I went here 3 times now for Friday group lunch and everyone came away happy each time.  The price was reasonable and the food did not disappoint.  The yard stick of any Vietnamese restaurant for me is Pho and IMHO it is fairly good with fresh green, very hot broth, reasonably flavorful but not too much sweetness.  The only down side to this place it it's a little far away from Chandler's town center."}
{"text":"So I ate here for the first time after reading all the rave reviews.  First thing I gotta get off my chest is that the ice water needs to be improved!  Tasted like crappy tap water with a slice of lime.  Come on spend a ill and get a filtered water system Pho Chandler!  I had the pho dac biet. Or the P1 I think it was.  Come on people learn to say it the way it's meant! Anyway I'm a broth guy and on a scale of 1-10 the soup was a 7. I like mine more beefy and it was rather mild. The noodles were good and I rate them a 9. Lil chewy and sticky the way rice noodles should be. I had lots of meat even after all the noodles were down in my tummy, which can be a rare thing nowadays.  Anyway I'll be back to try more stuff on the menu. Hope you fix the water by then!"}
{"text":"Amazing! This food is exactly what you're looking for. There's a reason why this place is always busy. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and consistent, great service too.  The only catch....this place is busy! So be a little patient, as they turn the tables quickly. I see lots of to go food heading out the door too, a great sign.  The kids loved the fried rice and spring rolls. So yummy, and so glad they are in this part of Chandler!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I've had the Pho of course and several other dishes, and everything is always amazing!"}
{"text":"First time having Pho was at this restaurant!  My wife and I enjoy the food from here. The staff is nice even if you are ordering takeout 5 minutes before they close!"}
{"text":"Had to change my review after the last few times the hubby & I came here. Sorry Pho Chandler, but your food has been disappointing me the past few times and I can't keep the high marks on here anymore. The pho has no flavor, and the other plates weren't anything to rave about either...except the bun rieu. One good dish. Good service. Two stars.  =)"}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese restaurant that I have consistently been to. I love the pork in the spring rolls, we always get this as a starter. The pho and the vermacelli noodle dishes are great. The staff is very friendly and hospitable. Look forward to eating here for many years to come."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years. Absolutely best Pho in Chandler. Top 3 Pho Restaurants in Metro-Phoenix Area."}
{"text":"Such a great place!! Extremely fast and friendly service. Every time I've visited no matter how busy or slow it is you still get the same patient and friendly staff. The food is always consistent and very reasonable prices. Great place for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Pho is delicious Vietnamese fare- it's always hopping so be prepared for a wait of 5-10 min or morgen weekends.  The veggie spring rolls with peanut sauce is fresh and delicious.   My friends lives the own ton soup, and my husband loves the vermicelli bowels.  Prices are reasonable and you get big servings.  And the staff is quick and attentive!!!"}
{"text":"We used love eating here.  But, unfortunately, as they have become busier the quality of food has gone down.  The service is still good but we sometimes have to wait.  We wouldn't mind if the food was as excellent as when it started.  The meat seems chewy like it was prepared in advance and then just heated up.  The only exception is the Pho, still great although I have had occasion to find plastic wrapper pieces in my bowl."}
{"text":"We love the friendly family atmosphere.  Food is excellent, great service, & clean.  Thao is great!"}
{"text":"I've come to Pho Chandler for a couple of years or so and each time I've gone, they never disappoint. The staff are all really friendly. The food is Awesome. From the Spring rolls to the Pho to the rice plates, all great eats. I love coming here because it's a nice small place tucked away but very relaxed and an enjoyable atmosphere. This is one of the spots me and a very good friend of mine love coming too."}
{"text":"Everyone knows I love pho.  This location is my backup given distance from house.  They are really good and if they were closer it would be a fight for number 1. Great pho best Thai tea.."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese cuisine around. We've gone here since they opened. Back then we hoped they would do well and stay open since their food was so good. Now, if you don't get there in time for dinner, there's a bit of a wait, which is great because that means others feel the same. Love their Pho soup and Bun bowls!!"}
{"text":"After coming down with a sinus infection I needed something to fill my belly and make me feel better. The Seafood Pho (I believe P8 on the menu) gave me LIFE! Snow crab, shrimp and scallops (not a big fan of scallops so, I requested extra shrimp instead).

The place was clean and the service was fast, yet friendly. I especially appreciated the fact that the containers were neatly placed on a piece of cardboard in the bottom of my bag. Most places, regardless how good the food is, just toss everything in a bag and send you out the door. This small detail added stability to my package to assist in avoiding spillage during the car ride home. All of the ingredients were neatly bagged and separated. (5 stars)

The actual Pho was DELICIOUS; though I was expecting a tad bit more shrimp and crab. If I counted correctly, there were all of 5 shrimp, 1/4 of the crab body and 1 inch of crab leg in my container. I had to literally ration the portion out so that I could have a second bowl later.  For the price, I wasn't expecting a lb. of seafood however; it would've been nice to have a decent amount in my bowl to fill my belly. (4 stars)

Overall, I rate them 4.5 and, since you can't give 1/2 stars, I'm rounding up (like the IRS). I would recommend this restaurant. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was visiting from SoCal where we have a ton of amazing Vietnamese restaurants so it's pretty hard to impress me when it comes to Vietnamese food. The pho was good but that was about it. Tried the fried rice and the banh ceo which is like an asian omelette with meat and vegetables. Both were just ok and also had their spring rolls which I didn't care for because the pork was grilled instead of being boiled which is more traditional. The restaurant is small but the staff was very friendly which was nice. Would come back for the pho if I was in the area but other than that the food was not very memorable."}
{"text":"Love this place!  We have been going here since they opened and have never been disappointed.  The vermicelli dishes are wonderful, as is the chicken pho.  Everything is super fresh & tasty!  When I order for pickup, the food is always hot & ready when they say it will be.  The service is top notch, as well.  Any employee who remembers their customers by name in this day and age deserves kudos!"}
{"text":"My family has been going to Pho Chandler since they opened and love their food. We always get the Pho, and usually order the Bun Thit Nuong and crispy eggrolls as well. Not only do they do Vietnamese cuisine great, they also have a number of Chinese dishes that are delicious as well. My son loves their Mongolian Beef.

Their staff is so gracious and nice, they know us immediately when we walk in and most times don't even need to ask for our order as they already know what we like. Great service! We go back often."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for almost a year and the people and food are absolutely amazing. We are pho snobs and the broth is delicious and full of flavor. Everything you order is good. This place is packed with regular patrons working folks and young families even during the week, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We had an assortment of dishes with a party of four. Everything was fresh, abundant, tasty, piping hot and served with a smile. Our iced tea glasses were constantly refilled. The cost is quite reasonable. For the amount of food we had, you couldn't eat at Mickey's or the King for the cost of our meals."}
{"text":"The seafood pho with the chicken broth was really good.
Quantity of sea food leaves more to be desired.
Quick and polite service and great prices."}
{"text":"First time Pho eater so I have no frame of reference but I definitely know what all the rave is about after eating at Pho Chandler, I loved this soup! 
I also tried their fried rice since it's an Asian dish I'm familiar with and love so much and it was really good, lots of veggies.

The servers were super sweet.

Didn't know this before hand but we saw most people bringing their own wine to drink, awesome, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My sons & I tried this place in the Fall last year and they didn't like it. However, I pleaded with them to give it another try.  Now, they love several of the dishes.   Food is fresh and we always take to go boxes home since the servings are generous ;)"}
{"text":"I ordered the spring rolls and the Pho Ga. I felt the spring rolls were made earlier in the day and not fresh. The soup was super hot, but once it cooled to an appropriate temperature, it was a really rich and developed broth."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's basically the only place in South Chandler to get actual food (as opposed to wings, pizza, burgers, etc).  The service is great, the food is delicious and cheap."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the south part of Chandler. It's nicely designed and very clean. The very first time I tried to eat there the wait was 45 minutes. Too long when you have to smell the wonderful food. It's a small restaurant and always packed, which says a lot about the food. When I finally did get the chance to eat there (several times now), the soups were great! The Pho broth is perfectly seasoned and not greasy. They have a medium sized bowl and large bowl. The medium is pretty filling if you plan on get one of their great appetizers. I enjoyed their spring rolls, beef ribs, and lettuce wrapped spring rolls. Their non-soup noodle bowls are also great. I like the grill pork with spring rolls. The service was great and the food came out quickly. I suppose it has to when there's so many people waiting. The price was very reasonable. It's not close to my house, but worth the drive."}
{"text":"First time here, very busy for lunch. Hope the food is good! Okay got my take-out order for me and a person at work. We ordered the Pad Thai, Papaya Salad, and Lat Na...all Thai dishes. I have to say that the food was very good with good sized portions. But the Thai food is a vietnamese version. I look forward to trying the Pho next time, I'm sure it will be great!!!"}
{"text":"Before I share my experience, I'll just say that if I was asked to go to this place again, I would say no and to suggest going somewhere else. I hate dry meat, especially in pho. That's a sign of it not being fresh. 

I don't know how people are in love with this place. They either have really bad taste or they have never tried quality pho before. 

My cousin took me here for the first time. I arrived and there were so many people. The entrance was crowded and every table was taken. Since the place was so busy, I assumed it would be really good. Yeah, no.

I was seated about 20 minutes after I got there. As I was waiting, I noticed the place was always picked up by a young girl to keep the place neat. My cousin and I got a table and we looked through the menu. I noticed that there's no option for a small or big bowl for pho. Just one size. I was confused because what if I want a small bowl. 

My cousin and I ordered pho dac biet (special) because it's our favorite, with all the meats. The plate with the veggies only had one lime. I'm pretty sure that by ordering two bowls, there would be at least 2 limes for each bowl. The meat was dry. I've been to other places before and it's never been that dry before. There was no juice in it. Definitely not fresh. There was barely any noodles. The flavor was ok. When I ordered a pho dac biet, I expect it to be dac biet. It wasn't. 

Besides from the pho, I ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee. I liked it way better than the pho. How sad because I should like the main meal more."}
{"text":"My experiences at Pho Chandler was very different, it was a Vietnamese  restaurant filled with lot of different food that I have never heard of. The restaurant was mellow and had relaxing music playing in the background. I felt like I was in a spa that's how relaxing it was. When I first walked in, the first thing that caught my eye was the way they decorated the place. The restaurant had low lighting, with a  mellow color paint, and it had a beautiful fish tank that had colorful fish. But the thing that is going to have me coming back is the food it was so tasty and different. 

     The plate I ordered was called Pho, it was a soup  that was so hot that when you put thin meat in it, it cooks in the soup. The Pho also had veggies and noodles in it. Another dish I got was an appetizer called Goi Cuon which means spring roll and it was kinda like a egg roll but the only difference is instead of being hard it was soft it also came with this sauce called peanut sauce. The sauce was sweet and crunchy from the peanuts another reason why I liked the sauce was because the sauce and the spring roll complemented each other  it very well. In my opinion I recommend people to try this food, it is a different experience. I guarantee you that you'll get an better insight about this culture and their foods after coming here. The food wasn't the only thing that was great the service was just as good.

   The people were very polite and friendly. My server was very sweet and alway made sure I satisfied. She also recommend me this vietnamese coffee and in my opinion it wasn't that good. Another thing I really liked about my server was how she explained to me what I ordered before I ordered. If you ever get the opportunity to come to Pho Chandler restaurant you should give it a try."}
{"text":"Love this Place!  Easy seating arrangement, clean and prompt service.  The staff are friendly and attentive.  Our pho soups are always amazing with great flavor.  We have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Was excited to try Pho Chandler based on all the stellar reviews. I don't like leaving poor reviews but felt this warranted one. Was impressed with the pot stickers, which left me really excited to try the much hyped soft noodle stir fry. First bite, I saw something black. It was a nice black hair. Shocked and in disbelief, I put it aside and poked around. And found two more black hairs. Now, I've never had Vietnamese food before, but I'm guessing there's no wild spice that looks like black hairs. If there is, please enlighten me because I'm really sad to have to write this review.

Really disappointed. Really wanted to like this place. 

On a side note the pots tickers tasted fabulous, but due to the hair, I won't be back. :("}
{"text":"YUMMYlicious!!!!  

Most Vietnamese owned Pho restaurants makes us feel rushed as soon as we walk in!

This place was very welcoming, and the service was OUTSTANDING and SUPER friendly!! 

The food was amaze-balls!!! Very tasty, authentic, and was served with just the right amount of wait time.  

We did not feel rushd - we were able to enjoy the yummy goodness - fresh rolls, rice, noodles, and Pho! 

We will be back soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Pho Chandler! We go at least once a month, and the food never disappoints. Obviously the Pho is wonderful. We also always order the spring rolls and the green beans for an appetizer. I also love the thai beef salad. 

The owner and employees are also very pleasant. They are quick to recognize us, and it always makes us feel like we are 'locals.' Can't say enough great things about Chandler Pho!"}
{"text":"I try different Pho locations around the Valley whenever I hear good reviews...Pho Chandler still 'takes the cake' after about 5 different locations. Service, ingredients, taste, texture and price have not been beat!

Best Chicken Pho in the Valley...not to mention that it is BYOB which I dig."}
{"text":"A great little hidden pleasure. The pho is some of the best I've had and huge portions.
Love the lemon grass chicken, Pan Fried Egg Noodle and the peanut sauce that comes with the spring rolls. You can't go wrong here. It does get busy but I usually take a to go order."}
{"text":"Been going regularly for months. Always had great food and service. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I've been to just about every Pho restaurant there is in Arizona and Pho Chandler hands down is the best yet. The quality of their food never ceases to amaze me, I won't be going anywhere else anymore."}
{"text":"The best pho in Phoenix area. Very tasty and fresh. Good amount of meat. Service is outstanding and prices are pretty affordable. I'm the regular here for sure."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! Finally a Pho restaurant for S. Chandler. That alone wins 2 stars.  I've been there 3 times now and it's definitely decent.  The other ones in older parts of Chandler are better but hey who wants to drive 25 minutes just for pho.  The rice dishes here are my favorite.  The \"pho\" is just ok.  My favorite here is their spring rolls.  The grilled beef inside really set it apart from the rest; and I like how each time I've had it the skin isn't hard as a rock b/c it's been sitting in the fridge for 10 hrs.  It def tastes fresh to me.  The service is definitely great as well.  Go Pho Chandler!"}
{"text":"There's a place where I can go and eat all day, everyday and this is it! Went to Pho Chandler with my father and brother and had a wonderful and delicious time. I've been here on multiple occasions and I have to say they live up to my expectations everytime.
This time we Got the Pho Dac Biet - House Pho'nomenal ( a house special combination of sliced eye round steak, well done brisket oxtail, soft tendon, trip & beef meatball with rice noodle) $8.25, Pho Tai - Sliced Eye round Pho $3.95, hot tea $1, and a regular soft drink $1.75.
The House Pho'nomenal is delicious and the \"small bowl\" isn't as small as you think, they have a HUGE bowl! My father got the Pad Thai and said it was really good and I have to say it is quite good. All together the food was absolutely delicious. My only complaint that when they are busy (and they usually are) there is not enough room because the place is quite small. I recommend they expand because they'd be better off with an expansion and make even more money. But all in all a fantastic place! I know I'm going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Only Pho I could find in Chandler!  Line was out the door and I know why!  Very good Pho and spring rolls.  Service was good."}
{"text":"I adore this place!  I've gotten their house pho, seafood pho, and veggie pho, as well as their lo mein and pad thai.  I have absolutely no complaints about the food, service, or atmosphere!  This place is wonderful for both take out orders and dining in the restaurant.  I wish I could give a rating higher than five stars!"}
{"text":"So good!!  I have been there 4 times and the waitress (owner's daughter?) seems to recognize me, which is nice. I hate it that they are closed on a random day of the week because it is always the day I want to go and I have been disappointed to show up and see the 'closed' sign. Excellent food, great service and relaxing. Delicious, healthy food close to my house. Makes me happy!!"}
{"text":"Ok, Mr. Hoang Bach. You coerced me to come into your family's restaurant to try it out, and so I had to take you up on the offer and now I am here writing your review. (Just for anyone reading, I've known Hoang since 4th grade and he has NEVER informed me that his family owns one of the best Vietnamese joints in the valley.) I'm surprised he would want me to write a review because I'm highly critical. So here we go: 

Chandler Pho, you're freakin amazing. I wish I can take your cooks home with me. 

As an appetizer, my husband and I always go for the egg rolls. Now, we're die hard Saigon fans (as I stated in my review for AZ Pho & Grill in Gilbert) and I have yet gone to a restaurant that can top them. Welp, I found one. Now the only difference between P.C and Saigon is that P.C's egg rolls use chicken and Saigon uses pork. Slight difference in taste, but I gotta admit, the chicken is pretty damn good. It definitely gives it a \"lighter\" taste and I can bet it has far less calories than the pork (win win). I got their Thai Iced Tea, and again, super delicious.  

Now, my husband and I both got our regular go to pho: Ph Tái (eye of round steak pho). Our opinion, again, just fabulous. They gave us AMPLE amounts of sprouts, thai basil, two giant slices of jalapeno, and juicy lime wedges. The taste was great and not too greasy. You can definitely taste the spices; far from bland. In other words, you can taste the love in this soup.

We saw that there was a kids menu and I definitely applaud them for that. Very rarely do you see a kids menu at a Vietnamese joint, let alone one with quite a few decently priced choices. We ended up getting the chicken lo mein for our two year old daughter. Sadly, she ended up not eating it because she was absolutely obsessed with our pho. But I gotta say, I've never had better lo mein. Seriously, I've been to NUMEROUS Chinese places and this by far, is the best lo mein I've ever had in my life. 

The atmosphere is quaint. On the smaller side, but who cares. Better get there before the dinner rush. Servers were very polite and were prompt to get us what we requested. It was clean and decorated well.

I give Chandler Pho 5/5 stars. Not because I know someone who has the in, but because they genuinely have amazing food. I will recommend them to all my friend's who want to try great pho and egg rolls."}
{"text":"I originally planned on eating Pho because I came down with a cold.  But then I saw Bun Bo Hue on the menu and thought this would be the cure.  My sinuses and tastebuds were happy.  I still added the jalapenos for more heat, but the broth was perfect with the right amount of spices and aromatics...I could smell my food even though my sinuses were congested.  This was the first time I have ever picked up my bowl to savor all that broth, I didn't care about etiquette, I enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Awesome food great service!!!! The spring rolls are fantastic, pho is excellent, short ribs are delicious. Worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"Nice lunch place.  Fast service, inexpensive, and family run."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho in town. We've been coming here for years and have not been disappointed even one time. Tao and the other servers are always nice and timely. Excellent Pho Tai... Spring rolls are amazing!"}
{"text":"Ive eaten here many times and never had a bad experience or for that matter, a bad dish! My whole family goes and we all switch and share, so Ive tried basically everything on the menu and its wonderful. One of my favorites."}
{"text":"Best lunch ever!!!!!! First time having Pho and I will be back again really soon."}
{"text":"We found this through the reviews on yelp and I must say I'm very glad we did! Pho chandler very clean and the decor is modern. The staff was very attentive and kept our beverages filled. The food was ahhhhmazing! We of course ordered the PHO. The broth was soooooo savory and the meat and noodles were cooked to perfection. I also recommend the pot stickers they are nice and crispy with the perfect amount spice. This is one happy customer and we will defenetley be back!"}
{"text":"We drive past 5 other pho places, 25 minutes out the way to eat here. Hands down the best Pho in the Valley. I always get the Pho Tai, meat on the side. Don't forget the Thai Tea!
The customer service is also unbeatable. Even during busy times your glass of water will not fall below half without needing refilled."}
{"text":"Loved it I got the special pho was beef flavor, my son got the kids chicken pho and he liked and is a picky eater, my wife got the stir fry and her idea of Asian food is panda and she liked it!"}
{"text":"My family and I moved to Phoenix metro a few months back and this was our first foray into Vietnamese cuisine since moving here.  First, the positives.  Service is outstanding at Pho Chandler.  The crew there are very attentive without being over-bearing.  The Egg Rolls were pretty good.  nothing to write home about but pretty much par for the course.  Now the negative.  The Pho.  So sad.   I was hoping for the best, but I was let down.  The broth, which is by far the most critical part of a good Pho, was one dimensional.  I'd swear it was from some sort of mix or the like.  It was very hot, which is good but that's all I can say about it.  In my humble opinion they have not mastered the art of the broth.  I will be trying some other places in the area to see if this is the norm (I will be VERY sad if it is).

BTW, I'm not a Pho snob.  I've had my fair share in Philly, Dallas (not good), Denver, and many many places in OC, CA.  I've had very good and I've had very bad.  To me Pho Chandler was just very boring."}
{"text":"I love this place.  My favorite dish is Lat Na.  The Chicken Pho is also very yummy.  They are always busy but still get the food out quickly."}
{"text":"I had the I really wanted to like this place and give them a glowing review. Sadly, the food was a little lacking in the taste department. My friend and I went here for lunch. Arrived there at 11:15am to avoid the mad lunch rush and overcrowding. So, that part was pleasant. We ordered the Gi Cun (Spring Rolls), which we shared. They were average (I make them better at home). I had the Bún Bò Hu (spicy thick rice noodle beef soup). This was probably the most bland Vietnamese soup I've ever had. Which was very disappointing because I've had it at friend's homes, and other restaurants. It's normally very flavorful and delicious. Sadly, it was not the case here. The Thai iced tea was good though- not too sweet.  Service was average. The inside is smaller than it appears from the photos listed on some reviews. So, I can certainly see how quickly it gets packed during lunch hours. It was a bit crowded when we were leaving. I seriously doubt I would bring my kids here. I don't think it's a good idea, unless you have very well-behaved kids. Otherwise, it may not be a fair or pleasant experience for other diners since the area is pretty cozy and no separate areas for couples or adults dining alone to enjoy a quiet lunch/dinner.

I don't know... I am a fair person. So, I may give them one more chance. I certainly hope this was the exception."}
{"text":"Good food, fair prices and good service. This is a nice little restaurant tucked away in the strip mall.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service! My favorite Vietnamese food in Chandler"}
{"text":"AMAZING customer service! Never an empty or even half empty cup. Super patient and let us customize everything with no attitude and even assisted. Solid food and quick!"}
{"text":"Still coming here frequently for lunch 2 years after my first review.  I love the \"bun\" and the crispy noodle stirfy as well as Pho."}
{"text":"Consistently great service and outstanding food. I often get the pho with oxtail and tripe. They cheerfully make this combination which isn't on the menu outside of more extensive combos. The oxtails are stewed to perfection and it's a fantastic umami fix. My wife gets the mongolian beef. This is among the best versions we've ever had of this chinese diner staple, by far the best in Arizona. The vermicelli is also wonderful, but I can rarely resist the pho."}
{"text":"We  saw that this Ph place has high rating on Yelp's, so we couldn't wait to try. We're always trying out new places looking for good Ph.  We were so hoping Ph Chandler would be our Ph place. We drove a long way to get here from Phoenix, and we were sadly disappointed.  The broth was water down then salted up for \"flavor\". If we have known that Ph Chandler would be this bad then we could have stay home and open instant ph package. What a waste of time and money. Seriously  my mother-in-law's Ph is 1000 times better than theirs. Few of their dishes aren't even authentic Vietnamese dishes; just Americanize, they are conjured up for non-Vietnamese that don't know any better."}
{"text":"Love eating here, staff is super friendly. Always remember the regulars that come in to dine. I always eat the spicy green beans and chicken pot stickers. Would recommend this place to anyone looking to try something new. Keep up the great work Pho."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I figured I would like this place.  Maybe it would be a cross between Saigon Pho and Anise, wouldn't that be nice.  My fave is Anise for the quality, but its on the pricy side.  Saigon Pho is okay, always busy, but the quality can be hit or miss and they tend to use dark meat chicken instead of white, which I prefer.

Anyway, this is about Pho Chandler.  I won't return since it's out of our way (we were going to a play at Hamilton High).  Hubbie got a beef soup that had the gelatinous beef in it (w/ brisket too) that you either tolerate or will make someone like me gag.  He much prefered the beef soup he can get at Saigon Pho.  Daughter got the Pho Ga and she liked it and thought it was comparable to Anise but I was thinking no way just looking at the dish.  I got the lemongrass chicken and it was waaaaaayyy too sweet...and I have a tremendous sweeth tooth.  I much prefer the lemongrass at Saigon Pho.

The place is clean, service excellent.

Anise still remains my gold standard and Saigon Pho my fallback for when I want to go cheap."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the pho here tonight.   The P1 pho without tripe or beef tendon was hot, delicious and filling.  The flavor of the pho was outstanding.   We also ordered the lemon grass beef vermicelli and it was excellent.  Portion sizes was generous and we had leftovers to take home.   The wait staff was attentive, but not overbearing.    Drinks were refilled promptly.    

The restaurant was almost full when we arrived at 5:00 pm and waiting a few minutes for a booth to be cleared.    Would we go back....Yes, we would!"}
{"text":"Absolutely best Pho in the valley. Portions are huge, perfectly cooked and seasoned and the personnel is friendly and quick to respond to any suggestion. Location is in a strip mall on a corner in the southeast valley, not a great spot but that is the only negative about a this place. Highly recommend this place to anyone, just don't tell too many people about it!"}
{"text":"Awesome! The staff was super friendly and on it! Food was great and several options. Our waitress was exceptionally patient with my dad has It was his first time trying pho. She took the time to explain the options. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! I didn't expect to like this place but was pleasantly surprised when the food arrived. The pho is flavorful and not greasy at all (some can be). I had the veggie pho and it was so packed with fresh veggies - great value! The spring rolls are my favorite - they grill the pork which gives a bbq/smoky flavor to the roll - incredible. The egg rolls are great too - the serve them with lettuce and mint to wrap them in. Yummy place!!"}
{"text":"Great place, food is always fresh and tasty. We usually get the Spring rolls with peanut sauce, papaya salad, which is amazing, some Pho and lemon grass beef. Those are our go-to dishes but everything we have tried has been delicious. Although the atmosphere is nothing special, the employees are attentive and have great personalities. They joke with you and will remember your name. You are never without water or your drink of choice. Great when you want something different to eat at very reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Good food, great prices. What else can you ask for?

The vietnamese coffee was my very favorite item of the whole lunch.

The service was OK and the place is not that comfortable but hey, nobody is perfect.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best pho's I've ever had. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, though quite busy. The servers have good humor and refill drinks and take plates before you even ask. They have large and x-large soup sizes! Egg rolls and spring rolls were delicious and over all just a great price and quality."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to try a new Pho place because we are in love with our regular spot, but were pleasantly surprised with this place. Unfortunately they were out of Thai ice tea, but the egg rolls were great as well as the chicken potstickers. I was disappointed with chicken curry plate but tried a few dishes at my table and everything else was wonderful. I will definitely be either ordering the Pho or Stir fry next time. It was a nice clean environment and the staff was very helpful and friendly. Will be adding this to our list of regular spots for sure."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  I only gave 4 stars due to the wait time for a table; you'd better go prepared to stand for a spell.  But the food is plentiful, affordable, and very tasty.  You must also try their Thai Iced Tea! ;-)

See you today Pho Chandler, I'm bringing you 2 new customers!"}
{"text":"Visited here with a friend for an early dinner yesterday. Upon arrival, EVERY table in the place that was empty needed to be cleared of EVERYTHING. Note to Management...learn how to bus tables.  For the 45 mins we were there the whole place was as dirty as I saw it from entrance to exit. The service is bad in that they pressured us the SECOND we sat down to order and came back THREE times within a 2 minute period. The green bean app, was good except it was on the cool side...just barely warm and was cold within a minute of placing it.  The garnish on it was old looking sliced carrots...like they store it in a container in the kitchen cooler and pull it out for an order.My Pho dish had pork that was SO SMOKED...it just STUNK like chef poured a bottle of liquid smoke on it. It was also the consistancy of dried jerky. Couldn't eat it.  Note: I have had the juciest pork in a variety of Vietnamese places.  Not here. The springroll was tasteless and COLD. The noodles were okay, but the side sauce was way too bland. My friend had more of a Chinese deep fried Sweet and sour and she thought it was just ok.  Whatever. We ate..well, my friend ate, and talked and NOT ONCE did someone bus our table from when the check was delivered even.  REALLY BAD. Maybe for Chandler this is good Vietnamese.  I'm from NY so...yeah...MEH. Perhaps the broth dishes are better, but really for the $30 in and out for food-I know because I was treating.  I'm not going back. One star for my poor dish, bad service and literally, cold food."}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with this place and feel at this point, I cannot live without it, so I better not ever move out of the area!  Their chicken and/or veggie pho recipe is so delicious as well as healing!  I eat it both regularly and whenever I get a cold and it clears the sinuses right up!  Take out or dine in, this place deserves a 5 star rating.  And Tao (I hope I spelled her name correctly) is the sweetest person!"}
{"text":"Literally the best!!! Been coming here for years, the staff is great and the food is amazing!!! So fast, and affordable for the portion sizes!! 10/10"}
{"text":"last week, I was sick with a sinus infection.  I had no idea what to expect because it was my first time eating there.
I ordered the seafood pho...let me tell you something...that was the most delicious soup I've EVER had!!! 
Not only did the pho (along with the hot peppers) help me with my sinuses, it also soothed my throat! I was so grateful to be able to taste each bite!!
Now that I'm well, I'll be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Pho Chandler is a mom and pop place and good.  Nothing fancy.  Service is always good.  I have been to Vietnamese restaurants all over the country and Pho Chandler is good."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is good! It's pretty clean inside as far as I could tell. Ordered the House Pho'nomenal (P1) as well as the spring rolls and I didn't have to wait long for either. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good pho or Viet food. I will say that the service is avergae, maybe even below average, and the atmosphere inside the restaurant is nothing special."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town!!! I'm from California and moved here about 7 months ago. We've tried many places and this is the only restaurant that my family and I all agreed is THE BEST! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"I'm thoroughly addicted to their garlic green beans. The sauce they are in is just the best. I haven't had anything bad here. The lemongrass chicken meat was a little dry but seems like it is that way wherever I order it. Pad thai, Bún Ch Giò Tôm Tht Nng (B2), and spring rolls are all amazing too. One thing that sets Pho Chandler apart from many other Vietnamese restaurants I've tried is the quality. They have the quality of a good chain restaurant so I wouldn't be surprised if they become one."}
{"text":"Me and the family continue to eat here on a fairly regular basis. I havent been on to update in awhile but I have to say that this place is far better than Cyclo. The prices and portions are always just right and the food keeps us all coming back. We have all sampled several items from here and they are better than most of the restaurants we went to in Northern California... the service and atmosphere are top notch as well. Unfortunately at Cyclo you pay quite a bit more for the slight air of ambiance that welcomes couples only. If you want to take your family to a quality restaurant owned by some wonderful Chandler business owners... take a peek, you will love it!"}
{"text":"YUM! I haven't had Pho since I moved to Gilbert from Southern California last August. This is on par with my favorite little Pho place I used to go to weekly, with similar, if not better prices! :D

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I regularly make the drive to get their Chicken Pho and if you're under the weather or just want some delicious Pho - this is your place! It's usually busy but well worth it and you can call ahead and place your order and it's always hot and wonderful by the time you get home. The chicken is white meat with no fat. The herbs are always fresh and crispy and I can't rave enough about their broth!"}
{"text":"I'm brand new to Pho, but it seems like they are doing it right. The restaurant was clean, small, but very busy. People were lined up to get a table and the food was served quickly. The chicken pho had a great flavor and the ingredients were very fresh and flavorful. There are lots of Pho puns out there that I could use, but I'll refrain. Good food, good portion, good price."}
{"text":"Spicy Lemongrass Beef is my favorite dish here. Medium is not even too spicy! Other dishes are good, including their spring rolls and soft egg noodle dishes. Only thing I'm not too crazy about is the calamari, but for four bucks it's ok."}
{"text":"Been there several times now.  So much that the waitress gives me a hard time (in jest).  She knows that I want a Diet Coke and Spicy Garlic Green Beans appetizer.   My wife and I have had a large selection of their menu and have yet to find anything not good.  

They now have a BYOB (Bring Your Own Bottle) policy."}
{"text":"Best Pho around. The broth has a deep flavor that comes from taking the time and using the right ingredients to do it right. Also try the spicy green bean appetizer and the Hong Kong Beef.  I usually go at least once a week."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times since my previous review.  When we come here, we like the Chicken Pho- good broth, very tasty.  For just 2 or 3 dollars more, you can upgrade to large and extra large, which would be enough for 2 people and is a very good deal.

I have also had the Wonton Noodle Soup.  This is a bit plain for me as the broth is somewhat bland but I do enjoy getting noodles and wontons in a soup.

This place is almost busy so if you come at the wrong time, you may be waiting awhile or they may even seat you at a table with other people ."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out because of the rave reviews but I was kind of disappointed. The service was great since they seated you quickly and the food came pretty fast after ordering. I ordered P1 for the Pho House dish. I found the broth to be very brand and had to add copious amounts of hoisin sauce and siracha. The mix of meats were just okay. They weren't juicy or flavorful so it almost tasted cheap and stale. Nevertheless, my hunger had me almost eat the massive serving haha."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho in the valley. Full disclosure, I've only been to 6 total pho places...but I feel that's enough to throw my opinion in :) it's clean, fast and great service, I find the seating to be comfy, they always have good stuff on tv...let's see, what else..oh, they don't leave you with an empty drink. The other pho places I've gone to do the charge per drink if you get soda or if you go green tea, you are hard pressed to get a refill. Give them a try :)"}
{"text":"Simply delicious pho. Pho is a go-to meal for me as I travel. I can say unequivocally that Pho Chandler's broth always stands out. The egg rolls and garlic beans are delicious additions to your bowl."}
{"text":"Hubby indulged my tastebuds tonight and my tastebuds couldn't be happier. Ordered the spring rolls as recommended and the didn't disappoint. I got B2c pork and shrimp vermicelli with an extra side of fish sauce. Sooooo good. I couldn't help saying \"mmmmmm\" after every bite. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Our first time here!!!! Good food and big servings. We came across this place after reading reviews on where to eat. Since we love Thai food we decided to come this place based on ratings :-)

We ordered pho soup with noodles and beef, beef Lo mein, spring rolls. Everything was good. We will be going back. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu!!

Its a 4 star only because the server forgot our Thai tea and we were almost done eating."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The staff is so incredibly friendly and the restaurant is very clean. Now, for the Pho, this is the first place that I have ever had it, and I am absolutely a fan. I love the spicy pho with extra veggies, it is so yummy. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves Pho, because you will love this place.

They are closed Tuesdays, just a heads up."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken pho for takeout and it was soooo good!! Very impressed. Most pho doesn't tastes the same when it's takeout because you have to put it together yourself lol but this place makes it perfect! Very impressed. Good prices too. Ordered egg rolls and they were kinda good, not bad. Asked for siracha to go and they gave it to me no questioned asked. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"It's good.  I like PHO. The prices are not that bad. Good portion size, but no huge."}
{"text":"I love their pho and their service! It's amazing food! I'm sure their food outside of their pho is wonderful but honestly, I can't help myself from eating a gigantic bowl of their pho!!!!! I don't think I can order anything else anytime soon. Love this place and glad it's close by!"}
{"text":"I love this tucked away little eatery in Chandler.  It is the first place that comes to mind when I am not in the mood to cook.  The kids are more then thrilled when I recommend it for dinner.

We enjoy the lemon grass chicken, pot stickers, seafood Pho and chicken Pho.

The staff is always so nice no matter how busy they get."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!! My food was terrific and inexpensive! It was quick and the restaurant was clean! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good pho, good spring rolls. Service is chaotic... we had at least three servers running into each other trying to take our order, but then couldn't get another drink or someone to correct a food item served incorrectly.  Overall, good food that you don't find anywhere else that we know of so we'll work with the inexperienced service."}
{"text":"I work pretty close to this restaurant and came here on a Tuesday during my lunch break craving some pho. To my displeasure, it was closed! :( Tuesday is such a random day to close for business especially with all the tech companies nearby. 

I came back on a Monday with about 1.5 hours to do lunch. This time, the whole place was packed to the brim with people spilling out the door. Oh no! I hurried to a server asking if I could be placed on a list. She pointed to the door where people were scribbling their names down. And of course several parties who came after me were writing their names down. But, I don't blame them, being busy is a good thing! 

After waiting for almost 10 mins, I saw someone sitting alone on the counter bar. I asked a server if I could sit there solo. Not particularly pleased about the confusion, I decided to give the food a chance.

It came out within 10 mins of ordering so I was happy about that. I ordered the pho with everything in it and thought the meat and broth tasted very authentic. My server was also really nice and made sure that I was doing okay perched on the bar. The quality of food and the kind servers will definitely be bringing me back for lunch in the future!"}
{"text":"I loved going here. The servers were great and the atmosphere is really lovely. Fast service and DELICIOUS food. Get their spring rolls if you can!"}
{"text":"We love the food and the staff is very friendly. My daughter asked for this to be brought to her Birthday party and then we had to go back on her actual Birthday. I love over ordering and having left overs. Favorites are the B-2 and Seafood Pho. YUM"}
{"text":"My experience at Pho Chandler has been great. I love the soups there and the service is good as well."}
{"text":"This is such amazing Pho!  My family doesn't go out a lot to restaurants but this is one we make an exception for. I highly recommend the Mongolian beef"}
{"text":"Pho Chandler is a great lunch spot.  The nice thing about this joint is that it is purely run by Vietnamese and that most of the clientele here is also Vietnamese.. that speaks to me sometimes more than any reviews!

I have tried almost all the Phos here but the one Pho I prefer is their spicy seafood (though not too spicy)... I've even ordered it to go and the portions are still huge!  I love the basil and the other veggies they pack your to-go bag with (and give you as a side with your meal).  I always use every single bit of them in my Pho.

The staff is great here - the little tiny gal is super friendly and always makes a point to ask how I'm doing and how is work and how is my husband, etc.. I don't think she honestly remembers all the details of her customers but I like that she's kind enough to ask and look like she cares about you... i'm a sucker, I know.  But her customer service skills are great.

Oh yeah, the vietnamese coffee is super sweet and addicting.. I've had it a few times and I have to say that I prefer to share it with someone out of guilt of the caloric density of all that condensed milk.. but anyway, it's yum!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best phó places I've ever eaten at. In this area at least. Their food is always fresh. Service is great and the staff is one of the friendliest I've seen. We go so often, they know our order without us even saying a word. I love the food and the atmosphere.  Spring rolls are also very delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here with my parents while on vacation.  The pho was outstanding (I had the veggie with chicken added); the beef with broccoli that my son ordered was not very good at all.  Stick with the pho or similar soups they offer and you will leave happy and full.  Prices are reasonable and service was excellent!  Place was busy but it is an efficient operation."}
{"text":"Ate Meatball Pho first time and Veggie Pho w/ tofu. Came twice in 1 week. It is that good!"}
{"text":"If you want chinese food with a great taste, AVOID this place. Maybe other dishes are good but, we got chicken low mein fried rice and sweet n sour chicken w fried rice. Just a casual chinese entree to give it a try. 28 dollars later with enough sweet n sour chicken for a 10 year old and bland fried rice. Portion of the chicken was terrible for 14 dollars, could get 2 full chickens for that price. Didnt even get enuff to fill me up very disappointed. Low mein was also missing flavor, noodles were lacking the sauce or gravy or whatever they are suppose to put on the noodles. Fried rice is better from the frozen section at the local grocery store than here."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusted with this restaurant. I was looking up restaurants that had received good reviews in the area & found this one to try. I've never had Vietnamese food so I was really excited. We walked in and were promptly seated. It was really busy which we took as a really good sign. There were some big groups that had come in but the service was still on par - the waitress took our order & it wasn't very long before we got it.

I had ordered the Lat Na & my lunch companion ordered the House Pho'nomenal. The Lat Na was just some chicken, shrimp, & noodles in a sweet sauce ... Nothing flavorful. And I had ordered it at a 2 on a 1-5 scale & it came out pretty spicy. The chicken had a weird taste / smell & the shrimp wasn't much better ... It had the texture of frozen shrimp that had been overcooked. I tried a bite of the Pho & couldn't have much more than that but my companion enjoyed it.

The awful part was that the table was really sticky and there were soup spoons in a holder which I had to pick through 3 of them to find a clean one to use. Also, there were some patrons at a table just next to us who asked to move b/c there were ants all over their table. When we got to the front to pay our bill, we also saw some ants on the counter & there were 2 people who worked there standing right by them who made no effort to clean it up! Additionally, our to-go box was leaking ... Perhaps the ants had bitten through it.

We are definitely not going back!!"}
{"text":"We've been eating at Pho Chandler for over three years now - and it's our favorite place! We love the Pad Thai, the Veggies Lover, and their Thai Iced Tea. There have been weeks where we go back a few times to get the same dish again and again! The staff is so personable and friendly. Sometimes we eat in, and other times we order by phone for a pickup. Either way, food is always hot, fresh, and ready in a timely manner. We just love it there and highly recommend it to EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"Big portions, fast service, and delicious Pho.  Love this place!  As a math teacher I like that they use a graphing calculator to compute the bill by hand.  It is a lost art.

I enjoy the spring rolls and the seafood Pho.  My wife likes the veggie Pho. 

Give this place a chance.  It is one of the best Pho places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First and foremost I am not a pho master. In fact, the first time I ever tried pho, I found one of my food allergies for the first time (tripe)! 

With that said, I steered clear of the tripe this time and enjoyed it. I got the chicken pho like a good white boy.

Am I the only one that sometimes gives bonus points for the patrons that are there? Hopefully that isn't racist but it simply validates a restaurant more to me. For example, no real Mexican is going to have a family dinner at Taco Bell, a real Italian at Olive Garden, etc. Likewise with this place, lots of Asians having family dinners so I can only assume that they know good pho.

The food was good. I was feeling down with a cold and this helped me out along with my warm tea."}
{"text":"Pretty good Vietnamese cuisine! Ordered the wonton noodles and the portion was large enough. The spring rolls were also big compared to other restaurants but the dipping sauce was subpar. I also saw they had Thai teas in pretty, tall glasses. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I love Pho Chandler! Every time I go in we are greeted right away and helped instantly! I usually get take out because it's pretty busy in there most nights. Plus when I get a craving for Pho I am not feeling to great! I am very picky about my Vietnamese food but Pho Chandler has never disappointed. Luckily we live right down the street! 

I've only had the Pho Tai and the pho chicken with vegetables combo...both are FANTASTIC! I love the flavors and spices that they put into their broths. They also don't skimp on the meat which I love! My husband has had a few different dishes from here (not a pho fan...crazy I know) and has loved all of them. Their egg rolls are delicious and come out piping hot. They even took the time to tell me how to re heat the pho at home. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 6 years and they never disappoint. I have not run into anything that was not delicious. My favorites are the fresh spring rolls and the spicy lemongrass Beef vermicelli bowl. The pho is also not to be missed. I like the P1 or the veggie pho with chicken."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I don't know why this place has good reviews. First of all the had to wait forever to get seated and thought that wait was going to be worth it. Wrong! This is not a real Vietnamese place if they give a tiny cup of fish sauce. Like come on, stop being cheap. Also, way overpriced. You can go down the street to Saigon and get awesome food for a good price. Will not be coming back here. I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Pho and many other Southeast Asia foods, but I find it difficult to get a good selection where I currently live. Pho Chandler is family owned and operated; you can tell they take what they do with heart. The only reason why I am giving a 4 and not 5 is because I've been spoiled for Pho, and I've had better broth in other places (not in Chandler, though). Their Vietnamese spring rolls are fresh and delicious (get them!!! - grrrreat peanut sauce)."}
{"text":"Excellent oxtail pho, but major fail on the lemongrass chicken, which tasted like teriyaki chicken ( very sweet to me) and then chopped lemongrass was added as an afterthought."}
{"text":"I ordered, I think, a C9 - vegetables and tofu over white rice. It was excellent.  I asked if they could make it hot and spicy, and they told me no, but there are some spicy sauces on the table so I used the red chili sauce to spice mine to suit my taste.  Service is excellent and this place is very popular even past the normal lunch hour.  I was hoping to find a \"lunch specials\" menu, but I didn't see one.  Prices are very reasonable and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Very attentive and friendly staff. Warm and inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everything was super yummy.  Even my vegetarian daughter found plenty to eat.  Staff was very nice.  Seating is limited so be prepared for a short wait.  But worth it"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  We ordered Pho Ga (Chicken) with Shrimp/Pork Spring Rolls, Thai Tea and Coconut Water.  the atmosphere is very clean, nicely decorated, and the staff is very courteous and friendly.  I might make this my go-to Pho spot."}
{"text":"just moved into the area and wasn't sure about the food but I was pleasantly surprised. the staff is friendly and polite, the food is excellent and comparable to Vietnamese restaurants in Southern California where I moved from. you could tell this place is great because it's always packed around dinner time. for just under $10 per person you get a decent sized meal and best of all, it doesn't smell like pho all over the place like some other Vietnamese places I've been to."}
{"text":"Love this place! The fried rice is good, the noodles are good, the pho is good... everything is good! The prices are very reasonable for the amount you get."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food, but this place is no bueno. It had this chemical taste which freaked me out."}
{"text":"We discovered this place when my husband and I were at home Depot, we love pho but it's really hard to find one that is really good. We noticed it was really busy and that people were waiting to get in. We figured it must be a great place since it showed promising signs. We waited for about 20 minutes and finally got seated. We ordered the spicy green beans, and spring rolls for our appetizers and they were so delicious. Freshly made. My husband ordered the beef and veggie pho and I ordered chicken pho. We over heard the table next to us commenting on the pot stickers so we ordered that too. WOW!  The chicken pot stickers were so good, I wanted more. My pho was delicious. Packed with great flavor, clean, service was friendly and consistent. 

We must have seen about 17 take outs. We have continued to dine in on a regular basis and we've always seen this place pretty busy and have never had a complaint. The girls are really friendly and always try to make sure you have what you need to have a pleasant dinning experience. 

We highly recommend Phó Chandler. Cross streets are Arizona Ave. And Ocotillo IN THE Home depot shopping center."}
{"text":"This place is tucked in a corner next to Home Depot where you might never see it. 

It has a nice clean casual atmosphere. The service was friendly and very attentive. We went at around 1:30 on a Friday afternoon and the place was busy but not full.

There were no lunch special combos but the prices were not what you would consider dinner prices either. 

We started with the Chicken Potstickers. 6 good sized pieces to an order for $3.95. I'm not usually a fan of chicken in a potsticker but these were very good.

Then my son ordered the Mongolian Beef and I ordered the Pad Thai. Yeah, I know that the Pho is the way to go. They even have Pho in the name right. But I did not feel like a really big bowl of soup although it did look very good at the tables around us. 

The Beef was to sweet and a bit tough. It was OK but I would not order it again. Neither would my son. He didn't like it at all. He did eat all the rice and had three of the potstickers so he had enough.

The Pad Thai. Actually quite good although it could have had more shrimp and less tofu.  It only had 4 medium shrimp that were a little chewy. Now while the shrimp were tough and slim Pickens the noodles, sauce and other ingredients were very good and very fresh.

Better than Pei Wei for sure as the noodles were not under cooked and over seasoned.

I will definitely will be back as its very close to home and its also pretty good. I got some Spring Rolls to go and will have them tomorrow with my leftovers. 

As for a good lunch combo I recommend Thai Rama on Chandler Blvd by Dobson. They have a very good Pad Thai  Combo that includes Soup, and a so so fried spring roll for about the same price.

I'm giving them 4 stars for overall experience and since they are Vietnamese they do a pretty good Thai and Chinese Potsticker. 

The spring rolls look really good as well."}
{"text":"Great pho broth, great service, too small when snow birds are in town.  My only complaint is with the execution of the Chinese menu.  So tired of \"brown sauce/white sauce\" I could spit.  There are so many delicious sauces in Chinese cuisine, it makes me mad to see it reduced to this, and the coating on the deep fried items is much too thick.  On the strong plus side, the pho broth is packed with spices, the meat is fresh, the vegetables are well cooked, they have several sizes, and they have all the traditional add-ins.  Summer rolls are delicious.  They don't have some of the more complex dishes and authentic salads.  But like most people, I come for the pho!  During \"high season\", come early or late for no wait."}
{"text":"Simply amazing place to eat.  Now -- that said -- it might not have the best location in a fairly modern strip plaza -- but if you find this place I suspect you'll be as thrilled to eat there as we are.  The Pho choices are reasonably varied, especially given their price ranges (which are family friendly).  Appetizers are especially good (we've tried several different ones), and -- I kid you not -- practically every time we go there this place is PACKED with people ... yes, it's THAT good.  (Again, some of this might be that it's an \"off the beaten path\" location and the excellent prices.)  Also, the wait staff have been incredibly helpful with suggestions and the like, so this is one of our regular haunts.  Highest recommendation."}
{"text":"An amazing hidden gem!! The soups are huge in size and delicious.  My husband loved his spicy Kung Pao chicken.  Best ending,  ordering a Thai tea to go . So yummy,  creamy and sweet. Just the kick of caffeine I was looking for. I was told the Thai coffee was even better!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"We went because of such good review but we left very disappointed. The food had zero spice or flavor to it and it was plated very weird."}
{"text":"I always get the house special pho...delicious as ever with the layers of complex flavors in the beef bone broth. This time I also ordered the Pork Spare Ribs stewed in Tamarind sauce...which gave it a whole new yum factor!  The sauce was so yummy I used it with my Shrimp Spring Rolls...so delicious!"}
{"text":"The pho was so delicious! This place made my boyfriend, who previously didn't really care for the dish, love pho."}
{"text":"I've been wishing there was a good pho place close to my house and BAM this baby opens up. 

The restraunt itself is small and pretty much avoid this place during lunch time or the weekends because it will be packed. I went here as soon as they opened on a Saturday and probably 20 minutes after sitting down it was steadily getting packed.

We had the papaya salad and pork dumplings to water. They were perfect! I had a bowl of pho and good grief it was everything I imagined on a cool winters day. The broth was so flavorful, the steak was like happiness in my mouth and the noodles were the added bonus at the end.  This place is amazing! They also serve my guilty pleasure Vietnamese iced coffee. Yum. 

If you want good pho for a very decent price, come here! Come early and leave fat and happy. Woo!"}
{"text":"Before coming here, I had never had Pho before, but I definitely loved everything I consumed there. To be honest, I don't really know what I ate there because my friends always take the initiative to order for me. However, I've eaten something different every time, which leads me to believe that it'd be hard to find anything bad on the menu.
Also, the girl that works there most often, or at least the times I've been there, is super sweet and very helpful.  She answered all questions about the menu honestly, and was a little spunky.  The good service only added to the positive experience. I dig this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! The steak and meatball pho is delicious! My husband got the seafood pho and he loved it as well! Great cozy atmosphere, and friendly & attentive staff. We will definitely be stopping here any time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"We've been here a number of times.  Great Pho!  Great prices. My only complaint is that the service can be slow at times and the staff isn't very organized at times to efficiently get people to their tables and served."}
{"text":"This place is bomb. Best pho ever. I chose P1. So good. Their coconut water is to die for."}
{"text":"Great service great food, love that they remember our orders (we go there regularly) and serves Chinese food as well as Vietnamese."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in chandler. We come about once a week, and the staff knows what I order as soon as I walk in--mint chicken and garlic green beans. Yum! I've never had either dish any place else, and I find myself craving them throughout the week. My mom likes to mix it up, so I know the lemongrass chicken, lemongrass beef, and various phos and curries are awesome, but I have a hard time ordering anything but mint chicken. Seriously, it's so so good. 

Friendly staff, clean dining room, and great food... who could ask for anything more?!"}
{"text":"Tasty Pho really nice atmosphere small booths but just 3 of us for dinner everyone enjoyed their dish"}
{"text":"This place never lets me down!

I always get the seafood pho and it's the only pho place that I've ever encountered that serves actual crab instead of imitation crab. 

The staff continuously checks in.

It does get busy but I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes. 

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food and Drinks are very good.  Ive tried everything so far on the menu.  The only thing that gets me is that they are always out of something.  When you own a resturant, you have to up keep the products.  We eat here almost 3 times a week.  and its the same thing.  Sorry, we are out of... other than that, everything is great.  enviroment is very nice, waitress are always helpful and make sure you get your food in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars for the value.. Is you need a quick, cheap eat, then it's fine.. However ours definitely not a place to go to for a nice meal...I had the drunken noodles and my main criticism is that it was lacking veggies.."}
{"text":"We stopped in to eat at about 7:30 pm on a Saturday and the place was PACKED which is always a good sign. We've been to other Pho places that were just okay so we had hopes that this would be better.  

We started with two orders of the \"Goi Cuon\" spring rolls and they were by far better than the ones we've had at any other place and larger than expected. 

We ordered the \"Bun Bo Hue\" with level three heat so we could add heat to our liking. It was AMAZING!  We found it difficult to stop eating due to how delicious it was.

Reading previous reviews had me nervous about service, but they refilled our drinks multiple times, and we had our food within ten minutes. The price? Even better. Three of us dined and had drinks for $30. 

Will we be coming back? Absolutely! This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"This place has great noodles. I enjoy coming here with my family and friends. Great service and delicious pho."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, that's what they would get. Horrible customer service, worst Pad Thai EVER, spring rolls were nasty, and they never credited my account as they promised. How can they even call it Pad Thai using the wrong noodles and the sauce was terrible?! Would avoid at ALL costs!"}
{"text":"FAVORITE WONTON SOUP IN ARIZONA! Hearty portion filled with flavorful wontons, variety of veggies (including bok Choy, yum!) and chicken and shrimp. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Cute little spot that serves reasonably priced food. Their regular pho bowl is large! For the price, it's really good. Their appetizers were great too. My favorite were the egg rolls. The Thai ice tea was $3.50 was good for sharing. Can't wait to come back and try their rice plates!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! The best pho and vietnamese food in the Chandler/Gilbert area! The fact that they are quaint, inexpensive and have great and true quality food is amazing. They are extremely nice and attentive and their Vietnamese coffee is to die for. My favorite foods would have to be the beef pho and the garlic green beans. Just amazing."}
{"text":"Visited Pho Chandler on a Saturday afternoon.  We ordered the vegetarian spring rolls.  They were very good tasting.  I ordered the vegetarian pho and my son ordered the seafood pho.  Both were very good.  The seafood pho had shrimp, scallops and a small piece of crab.

The restaurant was very clean and the staff were friendly and constantly checking on guests.  Food was served quickly.  Think the total of our meal was $24 without any drinks.  I thought the price and value was good.

We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a restaurant! Exceptional marks in cleanliness, speed of service, staff friendliness, value, and food quality.   Every time we eat here I remark on how perfect the food is.  My favorites are the green beans and of course the pho thai.  You must try the pad thai and the S2.  I don't remember what it is called but it is a crispy fried noodle cake served under perfectly cooked shrimp, beef, scallops on fresh veggies in a delicious sauce."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The place needs to be updated. Tape on the torn seats and air unit on the floor...not classy but food is excellent."}
{"text":"Pho not bad big large bowl, spring rolls not bad but kind of chewy. Friendly service. First time there but will try it again."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch during the week for the first time. The restaurant is at the end of the strip mall with chairs outside for additional waiting. Inside there were booths that lined the parameter of the floor with tables in the middle.
There was no line when we arrived, but the booths were all filled and most of the larger tables, we got a little table towards the back.
We were both greeted by the friendly waitress, there were prompt of refilling water. 
I ordered the sliced eye round steak and beef brisket Pho regular bowl. You can pay $1 for the Large bowl like by bf did. (In not sure if the large comes with more meat but it came in a wider brimmed bowl)
The eye round steak was sliced thin and slightly pink when served, the brisket was thicker and much more flavorful and savory. The stock was delicious, hot and filling. Rice noodles were abundant and they had all the usual veg sides, bean sprouts, basil, sliced jalapeño and lime.
Over all I rate 4 stars, I wish the regular sized was served in a wider brimmed bowl so I can really get down with my chop sticks and soup spoon. the table was on the smaller for 2 people with condiments and families sitting around made it a seem like we were all sitting at the same table. 
Over all, we will be back to try some of the other amazing food that on the menu!"}
{"text":"Pho Chandler is my new favorite pho/ Vietnamese restaurant in Az!! I got the P9 (bun rieu) and it was absolutely delicious!! A very generous portion, and priced a little less than most other pho places nearby, Pho Chandler is a great spot to visit if you're craving a noodles and broth combination :) (aka my go-to comfort food).  

A friend and I came here after experiencing goat yoga, and I'm so glad we did! There was a decent line when we arrived, but I took it to mean they must serve delicious food if locals are will to wait that long! Plus, the line moved a lot faster than expected (I think we were given a 30min wait? But it only took 15-20min at most!). The inside is clean and has a nice, minimalist vibe, while service is prompt and incredibly friendly -it felt like a family, with the servers knowing the regulars by name and asking about their day! :)

If you like Vietnamese food, I'd recommend coming here.. I know I'll be back when I'm in the area next time!!"}
{"text":"Iced coffee is wonderful. I highly recommend.  The food is okay, I would probably eat here again.  They do use MSG so if you are sensitive, it is probably not the place for you unless you can order a dish that can be made without it."}
{"text":"When I found out that my coworkers love Pho I started disliking them a little less. Just kidding! (in case they read my reviews, lets not make this awkward for everyone).

They were raving about this Pho place really close to work, so we decided to make a lunch trip and reserve a table for 8. When we arrived at noon, we found a mob of pretty disgruntled people inside, waiting to be seated. I quietly asked if they had put their name down or anything and was cut off by a lady in full rage about being \"in line\" for a table because no one had taken her name down.

To anger the lady even further, I grabbed a server and let her know we had a reservation for 8, in which we were immediately seated in the first 2 available 4-person booths. Unfortunately for me, I was facing the angry lady. Sorry yo- we made reservations. *awkwardly looks away*.

Although this Pho place serves a pretty big Thai menu (WTF?) I figured going for traditional Vietnamese pho was the way to go. I got my usual round-eye steak and brisket pho while my coworkers went for the #1 \"all the meat\" Pho. Our food came soon enough and after drowning it in herbs, lime juice and chili sauce, we dug in.  

I have to say I have no complaints about the taste of the Pho but I can't dare give it 5 stars. It was tasty (as Pho usually is), but the broth wasn't particularly aromatic or flavorful and the meat was not good quality.  Was it tasty? Yes. Would I eat it again? Sure. Would I take people here over other pho places in the area? No way. There are way tastier places with better components nearby. At $8 it was a decent lunch, but nothing to rave my fellow Yelpers about."}
{"text":"I know it's a Pho place but I come here for the pad tai- it is excellent! They spice it enough- some places make it too bland. Also being a vegetarian the tofu quality is important to me & this place does a great job not making the tofu rubbery & gross. It's just right! This is my go to place for pad Thai! 

My friend comes here exclusively for the Pho & she can't get enough of the Bun Rieu. 

They are closed Tuesdays which is a bummer since I keep forgetting & trying to get lunch then! Also get there early for lunch- it gets crowded before noon. 

I have read some of the other reviews about poor customer service but I have never experienced that. The staff has always been super friendly & gave me the impression this is a family business."}
{"text":"Delicious! Love the chicken pho so much went back two days later to get it again! Large portions and reasonable prices. My husband thought his pad Thai was great too!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant for Asian food.  Staff is very friendly and the food is phenomenal.   For someone who grew up in southern California the quality of Asian food in the valley isn't great, but this is one exception.   The Pho is as good as any authentic restaurant in Little Saigon in Orange County."}
{"text":"This place is a truly hidden gem around the neighborhood. Quick, efficient, delicious, and friendly are the words to describe this pho joint. 

The Calamari plate looks so naked, probably the cooks should use more decorations to make it appealing (like some lettuces, slides of tomatoes...etc). However, the sauce is great and Calamari is crunchy. Pho P1 has plenty of meat which satisfies my meat crave. Service is super attentive and prompt. They have full house during rush hours."}
{"text":"Small place but the food is better than we expected. Pho is tasty and the soup base is not a lot of fat.  Clean & better service than other Vietnamese restaurant. Highly recommended pho. We are from OC, California, this is one of the best in AZ, so far."}
{"text":"There might be a little wait at dinner time but its totally worth it!! The pho is amazing & the staff here are really nice. The green beans are such a yummy appetizer too!"}
{"text":"Okay, I have going here once a week now for months and I just have to say how great this place is once again. for the first 10 times or so I always got the Pork Bun or the Sirloin Pho but I am finally starting to break out and try different items on the menu. Everything here is awesome! The staff is always the same people and extremely nice and attentive. The place is always very clean. We have to get there when they open because they are starting to get quite popular and people start packing in there for lunch. This place has my repeat business for a long time to come."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with Pho Chandler.  Such amazing food and reasonable prices. The Mongolian beef And the garlic green beans are my favorite"}
{"text":"Very good food here. I've tried almost everything on the menu, it's all been great! Service is fast and friendly. The Gi Cun and the chicken pot stickers are a must. My favorite soup is the Mì Hoành Thánh (wonton noodle soup), but honestly all of the pho are good!"}
{"text":"This is my second  time eating here... Trying the Kung Pao today.. Food was good enough the first time to bring us back, nice environment and good prices.. Come check it out"}
{"text":"This is a casual place to grab some Vietnamese food in Chandler.  Nothing spectacular just decent.  The staff is friendly and you'll likely need to wait for a seat since there aren't many Vietnamese restaurants around."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Pho in town. Spring rolls are a must also.  Friendly staff. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I've had the house pho a couple times, a vegetarian curry dish, and the papaya salad appetizer.  All were excellent.  Considering the price range, this place is legit.  It's not at all fancy, but the ambience and service are good for a place that is surprisingly affordable while serving delicious food.  Most entrés fall in the $8-$12 range.  I'm very glad to have it in the neighborhood.  I can't wait to eat here more and try new dishes!"}
{"text":"Finding good Vietnamese food is pretty hard to come by especially in the East Valley but I was lucky enough to find Pho Chandler. I came in for lunch on a Friday afternoon place was packed so I knew right away this was going to be good. I started off with some spring rolls which were the perfect size and perfectly rolled. The grilled pork vermicelli was also spot on and very good.  Service here was quick, prices were spot on, and food was amazing. Would defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Pho Chandler is so very good! I have never had anything bad from there. Service is great and quick, and take out is also quick and easy. Everyone who works there is very friendly. The restaurant is clean and relaxing. I cannot say enough good things about this place. it has become one of my favorites! I have brought others here who now also love it!"}
{"text":"I never had Vietnamese food before I really don't like spicy food but my husband and I decided to give it a try. Pho is located in the Home Depot shopping center around the corner from the big Home Depot chain.  It's  a small restaurant and at 8 p.m. on Friday night it was crowded to the max. we had to wait about 15 minutes to get a seat but it was so worth it.  We both had a rice dish.  Mine had pork, beef, egg, shrimp and vegetables. What made it delicious was the fish dressing you put over everything and mix it all together I could have that every night for dinner it was so good. I have to tell you the wait staff is excellent they have a good understanding of the menu and make good suggestions. They are very polite and attentive. Would we go back there again? You bet !"}
{"text":"Ok ok... so I went here because the reviews were quite favorable.  And, I have to say the reviews here are pretty accurate - which is NOT always the case (reviewers of food include people who haven't had the real thing in the real country or at least abroad to formulate a more sophisticated and accurate description). 

Bottom line.  Very good (good food and great, friendly service!) but not the very best in the Phoenix Metro area.  If you want the best then go to Pho Thanh in Phoenix on Camelback and 17th Ave.  A total dive but... OH... SO... GOOD!"}
{"text":"Eh. It was good, but not great. I don't eat the soups at pho places because the sodium content is astronomical so I opted for spring rolls and a  noodle dish. My \"spicy lemongrass beef\" dish tasted exactly like Mongolian beef you would order at a Chinese restaurant but served on top of rice noodles instead of actual rice. Spring rolls were bland but edible. The service was perfect. Timely, attentive, and the food was hot at least. I've had Vietnamese food in many different cities and places. This is the bottom of that list of favorites."}
{"text":"Food and  service is excellent, my first time here ,order a vegan option rice noodles veggies stirfry,"}
{"text":"A friend introduced is and we fell in love. The food, atmosphere, and staff were great!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been craving Pho since I moved to Arizona about six months ago.

I visited Pho Chandler during lunch time and though it was extremely busy, I was greeted and seated almost immediately. I ordered the Seafood Pho and Spring rolls. 

The food was excellent. I was very pleased that with the seafood Pho, real crab pieces (in shell) were used opposed to imitation seafood like some other places use. 

All in all, an awesome experience and I will be back! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just tried this for the first time,  got the round steak and brisket pho. The food came out fast and the large portion was more than I could finish. Everything was hot and fresh tasting, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The won ton pho was great. Service was friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"I am probably in here atleast twice a week! No exaggeration! Not only is the food amazing but their service is great. I never have to get my waiters attention to refill my water or to order anything additional because they are just on top of it. I would recommend this spot to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great service and pho. I can't believe this has been here and we are just now finding it. Very clean establishment, family friendly. Prices and portions are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Best Viestnamese restaurant this part of town~! We try to go here every Sunday and the place is always clean and food is always fresh. Service is awesome too."}
{"text":"Delicious. Out of ALL the pho places I have tried on the east valley, this is by far the closest thing to home made pho I have ever tasted. Since I moved out, I have the strange thing where I crave food that reminds me most of what I missed...........and this... is the place that pleases my tummy. I'm very sensitive to MSG, and their food doesn't seem to bother me. So I am assuming they don't use it. Love the service ... although I question the host at times because she doesn't seem to remember me. I am quite the regular, but she always talks to me as if it's our first time meeting. I guess it works!"}
{"text":"I am new to Pho, but this place rocks.  Great Pho at a great price.  If you want to go for lunch, get there before 1130am or after 1230pm."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 10000 plus times! So good, the P2 is phenomenal and always fresh! Khoi is a cool dude works there and always has a killer attitude! I'll be back again soon !"}
{"text":"Delicious! I always order the spring rolls-never a disappointment. When I was living in Chandler my mom and I would come here all the time. Now that I moved to Mesa-I would still drive here. I always get the S2 I love the crispiness of the noodles and how it soaks up all the yummy sauce that it comes with. My mom has gotten almost everything on the menu and NOTHING has disappointed. The price is also a win! 

Today I went in on my lunch break-as always super busy even at 1:00. I would recommend if you are coming in during a time crunch to order ahead of time. The employees are pleasant-sometimes they seem to forget about you, but hey that's what happens when your food is fabulous and you're busy all the time. 

I would recommend this OVER and OVER to anyone around the area!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous.  This is a business...a restaurant facility and it is ridiculous to be closed during normal business hours according to your website.  Not to mention, you post a sign that reads, the restaurant is closed because you are on vacation.  Maybe, you should not have a business."}
{"text":"My friend & I found this restaurant on our way to Phoenix since our favorite Pho restaurant was closed for the day. It was fairly busy when we got there, but we were immediately greeted and seated. We ordered the usual thing at every Pho restaurant - Pho with rare beef & Thai tea. The size of the tea was pleasantly surprising since I feel like most restaurants give you a smaller amount than water. The bowls were smaller than what's expected, but the pho was delicious! Customer service is excellent, the staff is pretty friendly here"}
{"text":"Close at 8 on Sundays and I had a craving!! I called at 7:45 and they said they would stay open 10 minutes later just so I could come pick up my to go food! Delicious as always and first-class service!"}
{"text":"Worst Vietnamese food I've ever had. If you like white washed, bland, terrible Vietnamese food then this is the place! If you like authentic real Vietnamese food then don't make the same mistake we did by coming here. Got food poisoning from the pho. This place is offensive to Vietnamese culture."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to Chandler Pho since they opened off and on. Now we go about once a week. The reason we like this place so much isn't just about the food. Tao is very sweet, she not only stops by to make sure our meals are ok, but she asks about my family members. Roy also is super sweet. He calls us by our names and makes us feel very welcomed. We usually order the Pho-nomenal or P1, but I don't like meatballs, so they substitute with no problem. 
My daughters like the lemongrass chicken, it's very good."}
{"text":"I have been to Pho Chandler a few times now. It is the closest place I can get Pho/Vietnamese food coming from Gilbert. I usually come here when I am craving Pho but I'll have to admit, I have yet to try Pho here. I always end up getting enticed by something else on the menu. 

I have tried the Bun Rieu, Vermicelli bowls, and the broken rice plates. All have been good. 

Service is good. Price is very affordable. Parking is plenty. I will have to try the Pho one day. LOL."}
{"text":"We have frequented Pho Chandler since it opened. I love the bun thit nuonh cha gio. They put a large serving of vegetables. This is my go to spot for \"bun\" with less noodles and more veggies. Their green beans are very tasty. Their combination rice plate is delicious. Their pho is okay."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for pho in the valley. The seafood pho does not disappoint, real crab in the shell, scallops, and shrimp, and the broth is delicious. I have had some of their entrees before as well- I can't recall the name of the dish but it was a chicken dish with lots of yummy vegetables and a light sauce. Everything has been great every time we come bête here. I am also a big fan of their potstickers- the sauce that comes with it is great.
The hot tea was also only a dollar for a large pot for two people!

The service is also really good, they are attentive and friendly. And very quick to fill up your water throughout the meal."}
{"text":"We eat here about once a week, or we do the take out. My favorite is now the Lat Na . It's a plate of stir fried shrimp and chicken( big chunks) with broccoli, bokchoy, carrots and pea pods served on a bed of rice noodles. The portion is big, enough for 2 meals. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Sigh. So sad to have to update my review here. Went for lunch with the hubs on a week day. Got in around 11:30am so we could beat the crazy lunch rush. Ordered the usual, egg rolls (delish by the way) and our pho bowls.  This is where things started to go downhill.  1) I ordered the large pho (I love me some extra broth) but I got the regular. 2) Hubs ordered a side of extra meat on the side. No extra meat on the side (they tried to tell us at the end that it was put into the soup. Nice try, but that's funny that every other time they've put it on the side.). 3) Asked for cilantro (I like a little pho with my cilantro, thank you very much), and they were OUT. Completely out of cilantro. How the hell does that happen?? At 11:30am? Are you kidding me.  3 strikes and you're out. Next time I will be going to Saigon Pho."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great location and great prices!! This family-owned business is well-run.  Everyone feels like home!!"}
{"text":"I had to call twice to place a to go order because they weren't answering the phone. When I got there I could see my order behind the bar but wasn't addressed for 15 minutes and the place wasn't even busy. The food was just alright. I'd much rather eat at Saigon or #1 pho."}
{"text":"I was on yelp today checking out some of the local restaurants near me and I noticed Chandler Pho only had 2.5 stars. This is crazy I thought. I have been there many times and I love this place. The low rating is unjustified and made me decide to sign up for yelp and write my first review.

What this place is... A good place to get cheap Pho or Vietnamese food. 

The Pho portions are generous. If you order an extra large Pho bowl and have them split it there is plenty of food for 2 people and it's even cheaper.

You can even bring your own alcohol (beer, wine whatever) and they will give you glasses. I think this is great because everyone knows alcoholic drinks are one of the biggest profit margins for restaurant and one of the easiest ways to run up the bill. The decor is decent and the place seemed pretty clean. The food is at least as good as any other Vietnamese restaurant I have been to. The ingredients like basil, bean sprouts lime, etc. seem fresh.

This is a mom and pop place and I think the service is very good. They seem to remember my GF and me every time we go in. Be prepared... The waitresses (Tao) is very sarcastic but she is super nice and gives great service.

I saw some other reviewers comparing this restaurant to Cyclo. I don't think this is a valid comparison. Cyclo is decent but you are paying for the trendy atmosphere. Chandler Pho is simple but good food and much cheaper. I liken this place to Little Saigon but newer.


Bottom line... Good food and cheap. That's 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"If not the best Pho in the valley, I'd say it's definitely top 10. Unfortunately the place is a bit small, so there usually is a long wait specially during popular hours.

The food is excellent, the Seafood Pho (Pho Hai San) is probably their best Pho dish, although they also serve their specialty Pho which isn't too far behind.

The staff is super friendly, and always on top of things. Overall I give it a 4 out of 5 stars due to the obvious limited space issue."}
{"text":"Love love love Pho Chandler. We used to eat at Cyclo frequently but after finding Pho Chandler we haven't looked back. We can be found here at least once a week and sometimes even more. The best pho you'll find in the east valley and all other dishes we have tried have been super tasty as well. The Papaya salad is another favorite that we can't go without. Another bonus about this place is the service. Staff is always very friendly and they remember you and what you like and have never disappointed."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've experienced in years.  As I waited in line behind two other couples, who had been waiting for some time, a foursome arrive and with no reservation and are seated immediately.  The explanation given - unapologetically \"they're a group of four\".  I will never return to this establishment!"}
{"text":"This is the best Pho restaurant ever!  I've became a regular for months! And never gone to another Pho restaurant except this location. 

The first thing that came to my mind about this place was how clean it was unlike most pho restaurants...and it's even in a nice location & it's affordable...not expensive at all.  I have tried almost everything on their menu except for the chinese food that they serve which is on the back of their menu. And everything is SOOOOOOO delicious! Most importantly their veggies are all fresh!!! YAY! I hate it when i go to some pho restaurants and they give me veggies that looks like its weeks old... do they really expect me to put that in my bowl of pho? NO THANKS! 

Their service is fast & great! Staff is real nice and friendly. Since we became regulars they even know exactly what we want in our pho and how we like it. 

Everyone should definitely go check this place out! if you like veggies like me try their chicken veggie pho with tofu! or #S2 if you like seafood."}
{"text":"This is restaurant is my new addiction! I have been to many Pho places and this is my new favorite! I always start out with there spring rolls. They always taste fresh and the peanut sauce is a great compliment. I almost always get Pho but my wife loves the Pad Thai!  The price is right and the service is great! They know what we order now and we almost never need a menu.  Try Pho Chandler! !!!

-Dan S."}
{"text":"I love this place! The pho soups are so fresh and delicious. The spring rolls are the best I've  ever had. They are fresh and delicious. I've had the Seafood pho, and it is my favorite. I drive from Show Low to see family and when I arrive they know what I want for dinner, spring rolls and seafood pho soup"}
{"text":"The portions alone make this place 5 stars. Gluten free peanut sauce and the vermicelli (with fish sauce added) didn't make me sick so I'm sure! Very friendly waitresses and they fill your water/tea often."}
{"text":"15 minutes wait to get a table for lunch was worth it. Pho Tai Nam was delicious and freshly made. The serving size is huge too.
Will be back"}
{"text":"Since we found this place we've gone back about once a week.  The food & service have been consistent.

The potstickers are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Our favorite Vietnamese place in Chandler. The spring rolls are a must! The pho keeps us coming back for more."}
{"text":"Pho is great every time, service is fast and friendly, potstickers are the best I have ever had and they are only $3.50.  Plus %10 discount for Intel employees."}
{"text":"GREAT PHO. I love this place. The food is great and the staff are always so nice. One of the best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a decent pho restaurant in Arizona and looks like I finally found one and I'll be visiting more often! 

They serve their Thai Iced Teas in a huge glass jar and it's very refreshing. 

Loved their Pho. The broth was clean and rich with a lot of meat and noodles. 

Their crispy rice crepe and egg rolls are great appetizers to get. Pho Chandler has always been crowded and busy the few times I've gone so far and the service has been excellent. 

They also play sports games on two tvs so you won't have to miss a game to eat."}
{"text":"We found a crowd for lunch on a Wednesday.  Surprise.  But the wait was not long - about 15 min.  My wife & I shared a banh xeo (pork shrimp crepe) for appetizer.  It was a bit oily for me, but without the oil, the crepe would not be crispy.  My wife had the cold noodle with grilled beef and chicken egg roll (item B4): the grilled beef and the chicken egg roll tasted good but the nuoc mam sauce was a bit on the watery side.  I had the bun rieu (shrimp crab noodle soup).  It deserves a solid B grade (I had better & I had worst).  The service overall was prompt and courteous in spite of the crowd. 

We'll be back to try other dishes and bowls."}
{"text":"So this is my first time back in years. I ordered the PHO with ox tail. When it comes to pho it's all about the broth what can I say this place did not deliver. Although the spring rolls is quite tasty, small rolls compared to other places but they use grilled pork instead of boiled which enhances the flavor of the roll. I also ordered lemongrass chicken to-go and it seemed skimpy it's probably because we ordered 2 orders of it and just split the 1 order in to 2. Great business strategy lol 

I've had this before and it didn't look as skimpy as it did before. 

If you want real PHO with rich broth go to 43rd Express hands down best broth in town plus it's inexpensive"}
{"text":"I got the veggie pho for the First time and it was very refreshing with a lots of fresh veggies . I also asked our waiter friend to include tofu and they put ample amounts of it!

This time we also got the crab puffs and potstickers. 

Crab puffs were so pufffffy! Not too much flour shell but lots of cream cheese and crab bits. 

The potsticker sauce was probably what I liked most about the potsticker appetizer, and actually I used it to splash over my Pho! 

This particular evening I noticed two gals who brought in their own champagne (or wine), which got my very intrigued about whether there's a extra charge for that, but forgot to ask management before I left. 

AND lastly but very importantly, I never felt super thirsty after the meal!"}
{"text":"Pho Chandler is wonderful!  The food is fresh and fast, and the prices are great.  Eight dollars for about every entree on the menu including a full menu of popular Chinese dishes.  I eat here at least once a week, sometimes more. Love it!"}
{"text":"Came in with a friend on a Thursday during lunch hour. Pho was very tasty and Bun Bo Hue was also very good. Clean place, great service. One of the best in Chandler, so far."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pho joint in the valley! We have to drive 30min but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today and loved it! Definitely one of the better Pho places in the area. It is a small sit-down restaurant with a nice, clean atmosphere. The servers were very friendly and attending. The food is fresh, and still served quickly. We ordered and in 10 minutes the food came out, wow! I enjoyed the variety of food on the menu, along with the affordable prices. We will be returning soon and I will make sure to tell others about this place!"}
{"text":"So happy we found this place! The pho is a must and the lemongrass chicken vermicelli too!Fast and friendly service!"}
{"text":"We went around 7pm and it was really busy. It's a small location. They try to cram a lot of seating in but likely you will have to wait. 

I had the bun bo hue. The broth was nice. I picked 3 on a 1-5 spicy scale. Maybe I can endure spiciness more than I figured because I could have had a 5. The noodles were good, soft and chewy. 

The negative is that there is like a 3-1 broth-content level. If it's that little noodles and meat, don't add so much broth that I have to use a spoon to dig everything up. 

This is a quick and cheapened bun bo hue even though it was over 8 dollars. The meat (they listed it as beef and pork) sure all looked the same - thinly sliced and dry. That's all there is. Noodles and thin, dry slices of meat. In bun bo hue, you usually have hocks of meat, pork blood, etc. 

Partner got a pork rice plate. The pork was chopped up to a point that I though he got chicken. Just the meat, rice and lettuce garnish, nothing great.

Yes, most everything else is under $10 but everything is much more expensive than any other standard viet restaurant. Personally, food not worth the price."}
{"text":"The best Pho place in the valley! Service is fantastic, portions are great and the Pho is delicious. Though I normally order take-out I have dined in and had an enjoyable experience. They have several other dishes that are of good quality but their Pho is superb and the quality of meat is great."}
{"text":"Took my daughter for lunch and we were happy. Food was great and the service was friendly. They will not let you have an empty glass of water! Def my new spot for Pho"}
{"text":"Yeah!!!  Finally found a pho place I didn't get sick.  This place was clean and no weird smell except for yummy pho aroma.  I ordered their rice dish and my hubby ordered Pho.  We like to eat half way and then switch our dishes so we can have both.  Their Pho was yummy!  No skimping on meats, noodles and bean sprouts.  The soup had deep flavors and the staffs came around to refill our water without us asking for it.  My rice dish was yummy too.  I had korean short rib bbq.  Totally a winner.  Will totally come back.  I couldn't give them 5 stars due to tape on the booth.  They taped a hole with a duck tape and it was rubbing my skin to annoyance."}
{"text":"Oh my. After leaving Seattle I thought I may never eat good Pho again.  Wrong. Did a take out.  All the contents individually wrapped to mix at home. No skimping. Big portions at reasonable prices. Friendly fast service. Got a Pad Thai too. I'll be eating this masterpiece for a couple days. My new favorite."}
{"text":"A family owned Vietnamese restaurant where everyone can find something they love. Their menu has a wide variety of delicious dishes. Most of these dishes cost a little less than $10 and with it you are given extremely efficient and friendly service. I suggest going with a few friends so you can a taste each others' unique and tasty meals.
Needed appetizers to work up an appetite, and their fresh spring rolls did just that. The pork inside was grilled to perfection. Their beef pho was simple but delicious and served with a heaping plate of vegetables and herbs to add a little extra flavor. The menu item, S2 was a plate of crispy noodle cakes layered with flavorful vegetables and generous amounts of chicken, beef, and shrimp.
On top of the already incredible meal, we had phenomenal service. Our waitress was friendly, outgoing, and entertaining while successfully serving us our meal in record timing. All together, the experience at Pho Chandler was \"unphogettable\" and will not be missed for too long before I am back again!"}
{"text":"Meh. Maybe I just don't get pho. We never had pho before but came because of the amazing yelp reviews. Had spring rolls, their \"P1\" house pho special with a few types of beef and the seafood pho. 

Again, meh. It's a small place. The place was crowded and had to write our name on a clipboard hidden off to the side for a table, how people were supposed to know that I don't know. We got put at a cramped table right by the kitchen door and uncomfortably close to another couple, we asked to be moved to a booth when it opened. Spring rolls were alright. Service was fair. Pho was so so. Bland broth and noodles, bland meat. Seafood pho had two shrimp, two scallops and two shelled crab claws with no way to get at the meat. We tried to spice it up with the basil, jalapeño, salt, pepper etc and it helped a little but otherwise stayed pretty bland. 

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills when I read all the raving reviews, but we just didn't like the food and didnt see what was so special to warrant the 100+ near perfect reviews. I mean, they got better reviews than Cork... Cork!  Maybe this place just isn't pho us (sorry, unoriginal hacky pun, I know)."}
{"text":"I have been here more then a dozen times, has great hospitality an great food. They even ask how spicy you want your certain orders, I love the mint chicken  with a fried egg. Kid friendly an great  for business meetings/lunch."}
{"text":"Really like their chicken pho and ox tail pho. Been several times and have not have a bad meal. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Staff was very nice and prompt. Food was mediocre. Pad Thai, spicy level 3 was fairly good but the veggie pho was kind of bland.
Wouldn't really recommend it to anyone but it gets the job done. Nothing compared to the San Diego pho."}
{"text":"What an amazing surprise! Today is our first time here and definitely it won't be the last one. 
Food is delicious, prices are more than fair. Service is nice, attentive and fast.
Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"The pho could use some work flavor wise, kind of bland without hoison and sriracha. The chicken potstickers are delicious. Also the veggie spring rolls are good but not really flavorful either."}
{"text":"Really good Pho. Had some garlic green beans that were fantastic! The Vietnamese Iced Coffee was rich and satisfying. Prices are great. Service was unobtrusive. Will be back next time im in the area!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! This place is always packed. The food and service is fantastic. I recommend the spring rolls and chicken pho."}
{"text":"Post hiking food, I crave either Vietnamese pho, burgers or Mexican.. nothing else. This day I came for late lunch I was craving for pho. A quick Yelp search led to here as it was the closest to where I was. 

I saw Thai tea on pictures posted here, since it was a long and hard hike, I was looking forward to this yummy looking Thai iced tea. When I walked in, there were many customers enjoying iced tea. Unfortunately since I arrived past peak lunch hours, they were out of Thai iced tea... so sad...

I ordered pho dac biet. I was hungry and wanted to enjoy variety of meats. Since my friend asked for large size, I asked for the same but was told pho dac biet is already a large size. 

Large size wasn't that large. Meat portion wasn't generous either. I ate all the meat quickly. Not only portion size was small but each meat was smaller than I am used from other places. I sometimes order two servings of food when I am hungry but after I finished the first one, I just didn't feel like eating pho anymore. Feeling unsatisfied, I just went for a hamburger instead.

Broth for pho was actually very good. Service was friendly. This place could have been 5 star if they had iced tea and meat size was larger."}
{"text":"This place is good.  It is busy on a Monday night which is a good. 

The pictures tell you the story of how good it is. 

$850 for a bowl of pho. $2 for extra meat -probably about 2 ounce portions"}
{"text":"Went here actually a month ago, been meaning to do a review but just no time. anyway, the ambiance is pretty and clean. even though it was packed at around 8ish we were seated fast. The other servers weren't talking or smiling (but I get this kind of service on vietnamese restos idk why, i just got used to it), but the cashier was extra friendly. We ordered the seafood pho, kinda disappointed cos we had to crack the crab, wouldv'e been much easier to eat if it's just the crab meat. I had the s2, it's weird but good. It's stir fried veggies with fried noodles on top. Gonna go back here whenever we're craving for pho for sure."}
{"text":"Recently went here with my family and was not disappointed. I had the Pho with  flank and meatballs but also tried the papaya salad, dumplings and Mongolian beef. All were winners and the service was friendly and very efficient ( they must have refilled my soda three times). A must try..."}
{"text":"This place is magical. I always order the P4. I've always had it to go, due to work, but I'm planning on going some time in the future when I have someone willing to tag along. :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I's favorite Vietnamese restaurant. Everything is tasty here and I have yet to have a bad experience. I especially like the fact that they have items on their menu that many other establishments don't have so it keeps the visits fresh."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Vietnamese food we've found in the valley. Great Phó and amazingly tender lemongrass beef. We love this place and dine here regularly!!!"}
{"text":"Love the pho and mangolian beef. It's a clean restaurant with ample parking out front. Great attentive service. Becoming a Sunday tradition."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the phoenix area.  I would rate this as 2nd best Vietnamese restaurant.  I bit of drive from where I live.  But if I lived in chandler this would easily be my go to Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Living in the Ahwatukee area, good pho restaurants are slim pickins. So I yelped a few places and came across Pho Chandler. At first I was hesitant to make the drive but the reviews seemed pretty promising. And let me tell you, the 20 minute drive + the 10/15 minute wait during lunchtime was well worth it! We ordered a tai tea (which was guilt fully scrumptious... oh how I wish there were refills. But then half way through a very fulfilling meal you're happy there wasn't!), for appetizers - an order of the spicy garlic green beans and an order of the pork short ribs w/ tamarind glaze and tai basil (both equally to die for), and for the main event - a Pho Tai Nam which had sliced eye-round steak and well done brisket, and a Pho Rau Cai which is a vegetarian pho in beef broth. The staff by the way is very kind and pretty darn efficient! So to say the least, I left Pho Chandler with an overwhelming feeling of thorough satisfaction, and a soulful nurturing experience of pure goodness!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I did not try the food. 

We walked out. It was a horrible atmosphere and HORRIBLE service. The waiter could not speak English. I am not being rude....but how do I ask any questions? 

They served me soda that tasted like poison...now I am not some brat who just post negative dramatic reviews....except this one...but the soda was literally stomach wrenching...I do not know what it was. 

My wife ordered water....that must have been scooped from the toilet. 

If that is the quality of their beverages, then I do not even want to know the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Pho Chandler.   Love this place!! I've always been a fan of vietnamese food.  This place not only has good food but is also clean and convenient for me.  It's close to my work so my coworkers and I will eat here often when craving Vietnamese food.  :)"}
{"text":"Very good Pho Ga.  I've never been in person as my husband always picks up my order to go.  I have Pho Ga at least once a week!

For to go the noodles get a little funky.  I'm not sure why.  

Nice assortment of toppings.  I prefer limes and basil.  Excellent size for the price."}
{"text":"Hands down best veggie pho I've had. Granted there were a little more noodle than I care for but nevertheless, so good! 
I think of pho as a magical soup and this one made me warm and fuzzy. 
Also gave the Thai Iced tea a try and yum!
They were very tentative to us and very kind.  I expect to return again for some more :-)"}
{"text":"My favorite! Sooo good, delicious options on the menu... my husband and I love the potstickers, and beef pho! Every time we come in they are so respectful and kind. They immediately come to get drink order and soon to follow your food order. 
When we have ordered out, they are quick, and seamless! 
Highly recommend for a good bowl of pho to anyone searching!"}
{"text":"This place is nestled in a little corner of a strip mall.   I would have never found this place if I hadn't saw a post on Instagram.  When I walked inside I was surprised to see it was packed..with a wait list for tables.  Me and a friend got seated pretty quickly.  Normally I'm a pho girl but I saw a post for the bun bo hue which peaked my interest as I'm a spicy, lemongrass lover.  It was delicious!  I was a little scared of the spice level...so I went with a 2 out of a 5 (which I thought would be a medium)  but I tried my friend's spicy broth and realized I could have handled a 4.  Their eggrolls and thai ice tea were spot on.  Service was fast and friendly.  I can see why people like this place...and would go back fo sho."}
{"text":"Went here for Pho Friday night.  We got there about 5:30 which was perfect because we were seated immediately and within about 15-20 minutes a line to get in was forming!  Friends had spring rolls and veggie Pho...love that they ordered it with no carrots and they got just that...no carrots.  We started with crab puffs (yes...real crab in them and you could see the chunks!) and spring rolls.  Loved both of those.  Partner had seafood and I had the steak and meatball Pho.  So fresh, so yummy, and the service was beyond perfect.  Our water glasses never got below half full and our friends ordered the Thai coffee, which was served in a small wine carafe.

We love this place and have been a few different times...never disappointed!"}
{"text":"My family LOVES this place - very friendly staff and clean restaurant.  Great Pho in Chandler - highly recommended - the spring rolls, wings, and Pho are all great.  Also, if you want to bring in your own wine or beer they will accommodate you - no corking fee."}
{"text":"Very good pho food! Prices were good and portions were large. I will go back for more . The service is excellent !"}
{"text":"When I go on long winter hikes,  I crave Pho. 
When I need to hydrate,  I love Pho.
Feeling a bit sniffly, PHO.
Chandler Pho is a pleasant suprise,  and I'm so glad to have found it.  Busy and full of families, the service is exceptionally attentive and fast.  I really enjoyed my seafoood/chicken/wonton/veggie Pho.  Quality vegetables and meats will keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"WOW!!! This place has amazing Pho and it's worth the wait! I've ordered the veggie pho twice and egg rolls! My niece got the sliced beef pho and chicken fried rice all was super good!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Super yummy! We ordered three separate dishes and loved every single one! Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I found the place after read all reviews and took a chance to try, I ordered food for to go, and got thai tea was so good, a whole fresh coconut for coconut water, also very good.  The food, when we arrived home, was just okay...not a lot of flavor and seemed like spices were missing.  Fried rice dishes were not mixed, just meat on top.  The restaurant is very clean and nice and all staff were friendly.  Just disappointed with our dishes."}
{"text":"Love the food and awesome service.  I am here on a weekly basis with family and friends.  Love the PHO and Spring rolls!  Don't forget to try the Vietnamese ice coffee. And of course -Thao make's sure everything is GREAT!  This place is a hidden GEM in CHANDLER."}
{"text":"One of, if not the best, pho places I have tried in the valley. I have only been twice since its about a 40 min drive from my house, but well worth it! I have tried the egg rolls and spicy green beans (which are out of this world) and I always stick to Pho Tai, the broth is fantastic, seriously delicious!"}
{"text":"Raw steak to go. On point!

This place is packed for a reason. 

I saw a kid completely inhale the giant bowl of pho in front of him. 

Needles to say, I was impressed. 

Future food champion of the world, or is the food really that good? After experiencing the deliciousness of the food myself, I'm going with the later."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say.  The food is awesome(must try the wings).   I love the serving staff.  They are witty and fun.  Also they make great recommendation when you are stumped."}
{"text":"Ordered the basic house Pho and egg rolls. They were delicious. Service was great and it was very fast. One of the only downsides is it's a bit more expensive than other places I have been to that taste just as good.

Look forward to hitting up this place more often in the future."}
{"text":"How lucky we are to have Pho Chandler in our backyard! We've been going to them ever since they opened and they always remember us when we walk in the door and know our orders before we've even taken our seats! Every once in a while we change things up so we can try more of their wonderful menu yet but can't help but go back to our regular favorites!

The Pho here is so fragrant I can smell it from the street well before I even see the restaurant! All of their Bun dishes are always fresh and hit the spot! We also love the Pad Thai medium spicy as well as their generous rice and other noodle dishes! The spring rolls, egg rolls and stuffed chicken wings are always a hit too!

Strangely enough, we somehow manage to get a table with no difficulty and in most instances our usual table! We may have waited for a table once in all the years we've been coming here! By the time we're walking out the door, there is almost always a line of people waiting to get in! We must have perfect timing!!!

Tao and her family are simply the best! We hope they continue to grow and flourish! They have lifelong customers with us!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot for Vietnamese food. Pho is out of this world and other dishes I have tried, such as the vermicelli and spring rolls, are fantastic. Iced coffee is dynamite. Above all else, the service shines through. Food is served quickly and always with a smile and great attitude. Restaurant is very clean. The place loads up during lunchtime so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Fantastic Pho, always fresh & friendly, broth is consistent every day. I eat it 3 times a week, and never have been disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good Pho and spicy beef salad and calamari. Pho Chandler is a contender for the best in the valley. We did not experience any bad effects during or after the meal. We will return."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this spot! Super authentic food with great service!

We get the veggie egg rolls, chicken fried rice and pad thai, medium spicy with no tofu :)"}
{"text":"Short and sweet; Pho is a hidden gem for us here in South Chandler.  Everything we sample is really amazing and the service is always swift.  My suggestion is to get there early for dinner (5:00 or earlier) if at all possible."}
{"text":"Excellent food, not greasy, very fresh! I'm a very picky eater and the staff was very helpful in explaining the different dishes and making sure I got something I was happy with. The staff seems so happy to help you and the place was very busy for lunch on a Monday."}
{"text":"Very nice place, good food, great prices, and friendly staff. service was fast  and waitresses had a great sense of humor.  ASK for the soup spoons!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Fresh food and veggies, can't get any better than that. I love their #1 which is a combo of everything. It's delicious. Their egg rolls are also yummy too. It has a good crispness to it and also it's great flavor. Their servers are also extremely nice and welcoming as well every time my family and I went there. I love the fact that there is a pho house close to my very own house. It's even better when their food is delicious. It's a win win for my family and I. Great place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this Pho today. We have grown quite disappointed in the other Pho restaurants around us (near Dobson and Warner) and so went to Yelp to find another location. This location, near Arizona Avenue and Ocotillo, is in the back portion of a strip mall near Target. A little difficult to find away from the street.

However, the restaurant was quite nice. Clean inside, tables are bused using a cart and bin (a lot better than other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to). The menu is straightforward, the Vietnamese staples. 

We started with Cha Gio and Goi Cuon, both excellent. The Goi Cuon was very good, and they used the marinated grilled pork, which was a very nice twist.

We had Pho Tai, but the interesting thing about this restaurant is that can be ordered in Large and Extra Large. Given my appetite, I ordered the extra large. My wife and son had Buon Cha Gio Thit Nuong, which is rice noodle vermicelli with fried pork rolls and a very tasty marinated grilled pork. With fish sauce, this dish was excellent, probably the best I've had outside of my mother's home. 

The Pho was fresh, with a rich broth which I found to be tasty and not oily, as it sometimes can be.

We have found our new Pho location. The service was polite, friendly, and fast. If you're in the East Valley and have a hankering for some Vietnamese food (not the dolled up fancy stuff), this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Spring roll wrapper is very soft and moist, the texture is perfect. The appetizer pork spare ribs is so delicious, highly recommended. The Chandler rice plate is tasty and  portion is generous. The price is unbelievably cheap. Too bad I don't live Chandler. I'd come here for 3 meals a day."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great fast service, portions are pretty large. I usually end up eating the whole bowl of pho, other non-soup dishes are big enough to share. My favorites are the pad Thai and the p10 bùn bò hue (beef and pork)."}
{"text":"I love Chandler pho. My boyfriend and I have been coming here for years - its some of the best Vietnamese food in the Valley! We always get the papaya salad (not to get mixed up with Thai papaya salad!) And spicy lemongrass beef vermicelli. Today I got the minced chicken (I think it's listed as mint chicken) and it was good. Their pho is good, but I think their vermicelli is amazing! As well as most of their apps. We live in ahwatukee so its a little drive but worth it. The only downside is that it's on the small side and so many people know about it now that there can be a wait for a table sometimes (30- 45mins tops). Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Hubby got the lemongrass beef vermicelli and I had the pad Thai with tofu. Nice place and people. Very busy when we were there on a Thursday night, but no editing.  Reasonably priced, two dinners and beverages for $22."}
{"text":"Went to Pho with my kids.  HUGE bowl!!!  It was really good.  Also tried the fried calamari and Pad Thai.  Both were really good.  I love their Pad Thai!  Definitely a do again!"}
{"text":"Just the best pho around!! For an appetizer do not miss the garlic green beans!! This food makes you feel so good!!!!! Prepared fresh and with all the usual fixings on the side. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and love there food. Spring rolls always start our meal then it's something different every time until I get through the entire menu. Lol. The restaurant is always clean and staff are courteous and always help. Go try it. You will love it. I promise."}
{"text":"Wanted to give higher for the cleanliness and the very friendly service, but I came here for Pho. It just wasn't very flavorful. Lots of beef, good veggies and basil on the side, but no fish sauce and again, the broth was very flat and bland to me. There are definitley better places for Pho in the area (Simi's Cafe), so I probably won't be back for Pho here. Too bad for a namesake restaurant : ("}
{"text":"My husband and I never had Vietnamese food before. We loved it! I had the pho and he had the vermicelli. We have already been back with our little kids. The restaurant is really cute inside, very clean bathrooms. The service was really good too, she made good recommendations both times! We need to go back!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant with prompt service. 

The egg rolls were delicious, except they weren't rolled in rice paper.  The pho broth was tasty, bun rieu and bun bo hue both had great flavor and kick.  We ordered mi xi for the kids and it was a bit sweet for me but great for them."}
{"text":"Decent Vietnamese restaurant for a place where Asian food is not widely available. The spring rolls were interesting because the pork inside had been barbecued which isn't usually normal for spring rolls you can find at any other Vietnamese restaurant. The rice wrapper for the rolls were extremely chewy and thick, I wasn't a fan and just ended up eating the filling. I ordered the bun bo hue (spicy beef and pork noodle soup). The taste was good, I asked for medium spice and didn't find it spicy at all. The meat was pretty chewy and unappetizing, but the noodles and veggies that came with it were pretty good. Service was pretty good but the orders came out super slow compared to most pho restaurants I've been too. Overall a good option for people who know what real Vietnamese taste like."}
{"text":"I've had a Yelp account for a few years, and have primarily used it for the search aspect and obviously the opportunity to read through the reviews on any given business. 

Tonight however I've decided that a business has shown throughout multiple visits to never disappoint, and warrant being my first review.

 Pho Chandler is hands down my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the valley, and I've had some great food at Vietnamese places. This place has them beat on consistency and flavor of the food. 

The prices are awesomely cheap. It is CLEAN!! The staff is always extremely friendly. It's a smaller restaurant though , so the waits can get a little long.In a tiny restaurant on a Saturday night 20 minutes wait isn't the end of the world though. 

My fiance decided to get the Seafood Pho ,and I went for the meatball and eye of round Pho. We split an order of egg rolls with lettuce ,mint ,and cilantro as an appetizer. (Real romaine lettuce not iceberg)

Both of our entrees arrived at the same time. My fiance loved the fact that his had recognizable seafood. No Krab just real crab in the shell. 

As for mine. Meatball and Eye of round Pho is my go to when I get Vietnamese. This is the best one I've ever had. Vietnamese meatballs have a tendency to be tough and rubbery. Not here. They had real flavor ,and there was a good amount of both types of meat. The broth was what originally won me over during my first visit here, and it has consistently been just as good each time. You can taste the subtle star anise flavor that Pho is know for, along with the deep beef flavor that a lot of places I've been to fell short on. 

We have decided to make it a point to come here at least once a month because we both enjoy it so much."}
{"text":"Being new to the valley, I've been trying to find my favorite spot for pho. I've had quite a few so-so experiences so far. This is by far, my new go-to spot... And it's close to home. It was very busy around lunch time, which in my book.. Speaks volumes. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I'm very glad I stopped here after finding it by accident while on a trip to Home Depot. The chicken pho and spring rolls were great!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this.  A Pho joint so close to home and yet so disappointing.  We've tried to give this place many chances and every time it's worse.  The Pho is just OK.  Anything else on the menu, especially if Thai-esque are abominations to Asian food lovers everywhere. The owners and their kids are sweet and I love Mom and Pop places but I just can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute treat if you want to have Vietnamese food. We ordered the vegetarian fried rice and crispy lemongrass chicken. Both the dishes were very good and the service was excellent. I would definitely go back here ..!!"}
{"text":"My go to Pho place in the east valley, even though its a 20 min drive from me.. its way better than the new Pho Grill place that opened in Gilbert. Plus my fiancé that HATES Vietnamese food is actually a huge fan of their grilled short ribs so I can convince him about once a week to fulfill my cravings! 

Great service, great Pho! Great grilled dishes, have never tried anything here I didn't think was fresh and flavorful! I eat here once a week! Try it! 

The only thing Iam taking 1 star away is I can tell the broth must have a little bit of MSG, based on the amount I can eat VS the 6 ice teas ill chug trying to eat it."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week with a group of 6-7 friends. My favorite dishes are veggie pho with an addition of chicken, S2 (a stir fry dish with shrimp, beef, chicken, veggies, and crispy rice cakes), and a crispy crepe filled with shrimp, pork, bean sprouts (listed in the appetizer section). The spicy green beans are great as is the Thai iced tea. Yes, the restaurant is small and often busy, but the staff is so accommodating and personable and the food so fresh and delicious, I never mind the wait."}
{"text":"Food was really good. My first time there and the waitress was very helpful. Loved the pot stickers!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here in a year and honestly just as great as I remember. The veggie pho tasted fresh and my boyfriend got the seafood pho which was perfect. Also amazing service every time, would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. It's always packed at lunchtime which you know is a good sign. A big favorite of businesses in the area. Go and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been on the search for a good pho restaurant since I moved here, and Pho Chandler is a contender.  I ordered the P1 (runs a little over eight bucks) which includes everything but seafood.  The portion was huge, much larger than I was expecting for not being a large.  The broth had a very good flavor and wasn't too sweet like some can be.  The veggies were fresh, but I wish the basil leaves could have been a bit bigger.  The staff were really on top of things.  I went there around 8:30 at night on a Friday (they close at 9) and every table was taken except one.  The restaurant was very well staffed with plenty of people working the floor.  I NEVER had to flag anyone down for a refill and my drink never went below halfway full.  I'm not a fan of having TVs in restaurants, of which they had two in a very small space, but I guess that's just the way it is now.  Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"I am the type of person who is willing to travel far for good food. I just don't think I will be willing to take a 30 min drive here to eat it again. I had the pho and bun rieu here and they tasted okay. A little too bland for my taste and it seems like they add msg into them, since I was really thirsty in between bites. What I liked about this place was their noodles. They were cooked really well and the noodles weren't too soft like other Vietnamese restaurants. The servers there are very friendly and they make sure that your water cup is filled at all times."}
{"text":"My wife had been raving about Pho Chandler for quite some time so last weekend I decided to go with her for lunch. The place was super packed but the line moved at a pretty quick pace which was a good sign. I like how they give you a full pitcher of Thai iced tea when you order it--very easy to share with someone else and at a lesser price than the local competition. The pho was definitely above standard but also not as good as what's found in SoCal's Little Saigon (I know, I'm spoiled lol). The spring rolls were flavorful and I the meatball bits they included in our \"Phonomenal\" special were easily the best ingredient at lunch. I will definitely be back when I'm craving pho but don't have the time to make a quick trip to Cali."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is great!  I went here a couple of weeks ago with my husband and two other couples.  We go out to dinner once a month, kind of a dinner club.  We tried three appetizers, and all were amazing.  We ordered 6 dishes from the menu in which we all shared.  Also tried the Thai tea, also amazing.  This place is a keeper. The service was spectacular.  The food was just very fresh and cooked properly.  The Shrimp and Papaya appetizer was especially good.  The Pho was great, the chandler special w/egg on top was fantastic!  Green beans awesome too! Try the pad thai - that was everyone's favorite.  Beef short ribs also lovely.  I don't think anything on their menu is bad, as all the items we ordered we wonderful and the price is amazing!  Can't go wrong here.  There is no alcohol on the menu, but you can bring your own wine inside."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and the B3 vermicelli and the spicy beef salad were absolutely delicious. The veggies were fresh and the spices were perfection.  They had my food ready when i arrived and I was in and out and about my day.  It was extremely busy when I was in there and the wait staff seemed friendly and responsive."}
{"text":"Well it's good and the staff is just wonderful. The Vermicelli is good and the salad rolls are average, I just spent to many years in the Portland area to give them a higher mark."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write this review in case this place starts getting so full that we can no longer get a table, but they deserve the recognition because they serve the BEST Pho in my opinion in all of AZ! We've been here a few times now & the staff, food & drinks are excellent!"}
{"text":"Not much to say on this one. Service is good, but food was pretty standard. Nothing to brag about, I got the house special Pho and it was mostly noodles, not very much in terms of toppings or meat. I likley won't be back as there are other pho places I'd would rather visit, but I would come again if others I was with insisted on it or I was just in the area."}
{"text":"I introduced my family to Vietnamese food with the restaurant.  I enjoy the authentic Vietnamese dishes (short ribs with rice) while they like the Pho.

This place is nothing short of amazing.  The spring rolls are great and the Vietnamese coffee and Thai Iced Tea are great.  This place gets busy at lunch and in the evenings and it is worth either taking out or preparing a wait.  

I will dock this one star as I have seen the staff save empty tables for their friends with no reservations.  It is frustrating to be on the next spot on a waiting list and seeing new faces getting out of a car being led to what should have been your table."}
{"text":"Me and my family was staying in Chandler for the weekend about two weeks ago and decided to try a local spot nearby. I felt like having Pho that night.. Based on the reviews on Yelp we thought to give this place a shot. Keep in mind.. I have been eating Pho for 15+ years around Westminster and Garden Grove.. So my expertise came into affect that night.. First we ordered the Thai Tea around $3 which was good and not too sweet.. Even mixture of Tea and Condensed Milk.. We also ordered the Pho Tai and Egg Rolls, Fried Rice, also The Chandler Special...There was only one size for the Pho it was a medium size for around $9.. We also ordered a side of egg rolls. You only get 3 for the price of $6-7. In my opinion for the price you should get at least 4 instead. They were quite small but good.. but too expensive. The fried rice was ok but too dry.. The Chandler Special was ok.. I was mostly disappointed in the Pho Tai.. The broth was too bland and it had very little beef shanks inside. You call this Pho? You should name it No Chandler instead.. lol This place deserves two stars because the food was not good or great..the service was not good either. They just took our order and served us and that's it! They did not check up on us to see if we needed refills or anything... I will not be going here again.. I will stick to eating Real Pho here in O.C. :)"}
{"text":"This is your Vietnamese grandma's comfort food that you dream about when you're stuck at college eating dorm food. 

Yes, there is some good pho here. I love the rice dishes but the beef pho is what I come back for. The prices are average so its pretty affordable and the portions are fair. It was close to our apartment so it was convenient too. 

During dinner there may be a line and for good reason. Their food is delicious! They have regulars that they great by name too. That's always a good sign. 

Next time it rains in Chandler, go here and get yourself a bowl of beef pho because over all I'd day : shut up and take my money! Five stars...."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff, delicious food & large portions. The veggie pho is my favorite in the Valley. It's been busy each time I've gone, but the wait has never been more than 15min."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The food was great. Service was wonderful. It was pretty busy too, which just means it's good food! Will def be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Pho place in the area. It's never too busy, but never too empty where you feel awkward eating \"alone\". There is this one lovely hostess who always takes orders and seats customers who we simply adore. She remembers us and our typical orders even though we've only been there maybe 4 or 5 times. She even served my mom a free appetizer and iced tea for her birthday today! I would have to say she is one of the reasons we keep coming back.

The other reason would be the \"un-pho-gettable\" pho! The bowls are huge! (Even the normal size.) We always leave with leftovers without having to empty our wallets. The prices are very affordable and we love the flavor of their pho. And if you're looking for a great appetizer, try their fried calamari! Simply delish!

The only reason this place misses the 5-star mark is because I don't think some of the waiters/waitresses that bring out the food speak English very well, or aren't very sociable, at least. We had some difficulty communicating that we wanted an extra plate and bowl. Also, their \"specials\" aren't anything special in particular. At least the ones I've had (beef low mein & sweet and sour chicken). They taste pretty much like any typical Chinese restaurant.

So if you're in Chandler, give them a try, but have the Pho. That will make your trip definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Pho food in Chandler. The owner is always attentive and eager to help with what ever you may want. My wife and I have been going here they opened."}
{"text":"So wonderful and clean - Great food and service - I just moved to Chandler from the LA area and will be coming here often.  Like again tomorrow."}
{"text":"I used to frequent a popular pho spot in CenPho (see what I did there?) and put up with borderline abuse disguised as service for mediocre food.  I recently moved to Chandler and was desperate for a pho fix.  Saw this place while shopping nearby and decided to give it a try.  It's now in my regular weekly rotation!

My wife and I have always ordered the same thing, regular plain pho and it is consistently delicious and super fresh.  We usually get it to go and it's packaged better than most Amazon shipments I've received - all of the veggies (sprouts, cilantro, onions) are in separate containers, along with the hoisin/sriracha mixture that makes the broth so delicious.

The place is ALWAYS packed and the clientele is super diverse.  Service is quick, efficient and friendly.  I've never seen a single employee who wasn't hustling.

Worth a visit for dining in or tasty take-out!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way back from the kids soccer practice.  Was too hot for Pho so decided to settle for the Chandler Special Rice Plate.  Marinated pork chop, beef, shrimp and egg.  Like I stated in my other review of another Pho restaurant, I like the egg fried with running yolk,  It was sorta runny so I was fine.  It was large enough for my wife and daughter to split.  I also ordered the spring roll and the kids had the egg rolls.  They get our approval and my stomach was happy too.  

The restaurant is clean but really small.  It filled up quick but the service was awesome and running smoothly so people were not waiting long.  They are getting a 4 due to the fact we haven't tried the Pho.  Will be going back in the winter to try the Pho.  Will give another review then."}
{"text":"Drove by this place several times and decided to finally stop by to check it out one afternoon.   It was by far the worst pho I've EVER had!  We couldn't even finish our lunch and went next door and grabbed some burritos.  The soup had no flavor and had about 2 pieces meat in my bowl.  So, most likely will not go back unless the owner is changed."}
{"text":"Great service!! Friendly!! Food is wonderful!! This place is our new jaunt. Eaten here 3 times this week. Excellent each time. Will continue to frequent this yummy pho restaurant."}
{"text":"We found ourselves in this part of Chandler recently and so my husband and I decided to stop in for some pho. Unfortunately it was late and they were getting ready to close but they graciously offered us some to go. When we got some we really enjoyed our meal. Their pho is outstanding! I look forward to visiting them again."}
{"text":"Loved the Papaya Salad, it was so fresh and amazing. The food was good and the service was AWESOME!  They are willing to give recommendations and suggestions for those that are not familiar with the food. I went with some family and friends (I am from Denver) and it was fun."}
{"text":"Tasty tasty pho! Nestled within the Home Depot shopping plaza is Pho Chandler, a little Vietnamese restaurant serving up pho, vermicelli, and rice plates. We stepped in here around 6 on a Saturday and while it was decently busy, there were still seats available. 

We started with some spring roll appetizers, veggie and meat. The veggie spring roll was filled with chopped, fried tofu, vermicelli, and fresh greens. The meat spring roll had a lovely bbq pork with shrimp. Both were tasty and we finished them in no time.

I pored through the menu and decided on the seafood pho ($8). It was filled with shrimp, scallops, and whole pieces of crab in shell. The broth was light, yet flavorful, and the veggies that were served on the side were very fresh. Not a bad deal for $8!

If I'm in the area, this is definitely a place I'll go to if I'm wanting Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Chandler Pho. Pronounced \"Fa\"

Cleanliness: place looked clean but did not check the restrooms cause it was a to-go order. 

There were two large TVs in the small dining area and a small bar near the entrance. I ordered the Seafood Pho because it seemed to be a spicy dish.

The to-go order is packaged nicely and the seafood, noodles and greens are separated to ensure the freshness when served.  It also comes with a red si racha sauce which adds to the dish.  It did not have a lot of seafood in the dish but, then again I only paid 9 bucks.  Four shrimp, two scallops, and three pieces of crab legs (seafood portions 4 stars). But the flavor of the soup with the cilantro, fresh jalapeño slices and onions were a 5 out of 5 stars. The spices in the soup create a symphony of seafood and spice flavors in your mouth. 
I would give the meal an overall 4.5 stars.  Would like to try other dishes....UPDATE!!!


My original review of this place would have been a 4,5 stars out of 5 until I saw my bank statement and noticed that the restaurant decided to add an unauthorized 50% tip to my to-go bill.  Was upset...

Spoke with the manager Thao B who stated they had accidentally overcharged my card and agreed to refund the overcharge. She was very nice on the phone. Look forward to trying this place again."}
{"text":"I almost want to say the food was terrible so no one will come back and I have the place to myself! Food is amazing. I moved from westminster CA and I KNOW good Vietnamese food. This is the best food in chandler. Oooo mmmyyyy sooo goooood. I'm eating it right now. Ooo yeeaahhhb"}
{"text":"Staff are friendly and quick (even when it's a crowded lunch hour, they seem to find us a seat in 10 minutes or less). A perfect meal is an order of spring rolls, P1, and a Thai Iced coffee. Bonus: the TV channels are always (quietly) entertaining. Bewitched! was on last time. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for some lunch, and it was fine. The pho was really tasty- not too salty, with a good mix of all the ingredients (I ordered the Dac Biet pho, with tendon, tripe, meatballs, etc). We ordered some wings, and they just weren't really amazing. They were fine, as far as wings go, but nothing that I would order again. Some people might really like then, but for me they just didn't hit the spot. 

I was disappointed that they didn't have preserved plum soda drink. Honestly, I judge Vietnamese restaurants by the availability of that. I could be wrong but I don't think that they even offered Vietnamese coffee. 

Service was great, but there just wasn't anything here that tickled my tithes enough to come back. If I lived closer I'd probably come here all the time, but as it stands there are restaurants closer to my area which I like much better."}
{"text":"If you feel in need of Pho, this place will not disappoint. Have always picked up food to go so can't review the customer service but as far as the food is concerned it's on point!"}
{"text":"I work in this area, and met a vendor at this place. The food to me was just on par, however everyone else in the group liked it. I am not one for this type of food so that may play more of a role. The portions are decent size, and the service is hands down great. It is not too busy ever so its nice to be able to go in have a conversation and hear who you are with rather than over powering noise.

I would go back if the person I was going with wanted this food."}
{"text":"This is the only spot my wife and I will get Pho from. It's a little out of the way of my house, but well worth the detour."}
{"text":"Not satisfied with this place at all. Ordered a large bowl and got the same amount of food as the normal bowl.  Taste like it was watered down. Had to add a lot of sauce to cover the taste. Service wasn't good either."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to this place in at least a year.  Met up with some friends for lunch of a Monday at friends 11:30. There was plenty of seating, though starting to fill. The service was great, very attentive.

We ordered the Papaya Salad, Fresh Spring Rolls, Pho (Sliced eye round steak, well done brisket and rice noodle) and the Thai Style Stir-Fried with chicken breast, shrimps, and rice noodle. All the food was good, fresh and made extra spicy when requested. Service was also very good. By 12:00 p.m., the place was filled with a line out the door.

I'm a fan because the food is good, service is good and it is so conveniently located to where I live in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Great little family owned Vietnamese restaurant. Went here for lunch a week or two ago to have some father/daughter time. Very friendly atmosphere and clean. The food is awesome and in good size portions! I had the Ph Xào Gà Tôm Thái Lan - Lat Na (Thai Style Stir-Fried with chicken breast, shrimps, and rice noodle) with the #3 spicy rating. You can take that up to a #5 for spicyness.
Excellent service. Will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place... Highly recommend. Bummer that they are closed on Tuesdays as that's when I seem to crave it the most. Lol.  Always taste fresh. Staff is friendly.  Love the small local feel.  The Pho is delicious every time. I love the P3 which has brisket as steak while my girlfriend love the P8-seafood Pho.  They do get pretty busy during peak times, but trust me it is worth the wait.  I never knew soup could pack such a flavorful punch."}
{"text":"Read about this place on a Yelp so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm somewhat picky about Vietnamese restaurants as I travel to Bay Area a lot. But this place is exceptionally good. The service was solid and very friendly. Place is very clean and well maintained. You can tell they take pride in making their restaurant welcoming. But most importantly the food is fresh, well prepared and very tasty. I have the seafood phu and it was fantastic. The vegetables were crisp and fresh. 

Pho Chandler had good traffic so you know they are pleasing their clients. I look forward to my next visit.  

Well Done Pho Chandler!!!"}
{"text":"Best place for pho in AZ hands down. I have had pho at almost every place, all over the valley and this is by far the best. Veggie pho or beef pho.  They are all amazing. The other food is great too. Worst part about coming here is having to make the hard decision of what to get because everything is so delicious."}
{"text":"As far as I know, this is the only vietnamese restaurant that has real crab meat pho (item #P9 specifically)! It is my all time favorite and I would go whenever I crave for it. The broth is so flavorful, it is exceptional. They don't skimp on the crab meat either and I always leave satisfied. 

My husband really enjoys their eggrolls and rice plates. The food is always fresh and tasty. Eggrolls are a good size and very satisfying. 

I have not tried any other items because I am still stucked on their P9, being a seafood lover....

This place can get very busy sometimes and the wait is long. It is not a very big restaurant, hence big groups don't sit well here. The atmosphere isn't great either, just a great open space. But it is still clean and service is good."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, decent Pho, good customer service. Spring rolls could be bigger. Like it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and ended up waiting maybe 10 minutes for a table. Not too many pho places this far south but worth the wait. Service was friendly and the pho was delish. Probably won't be coming back considering the distance but would be a regular if I were close."}
{"text":"This time of year, when it's a little chilly out, or you're thinking you might be coming down with a cold, I got the cure...

Get a giant bowl of Pho! 

If you're not sure what it is, or you're a little freaked out by new foods, don't be. To over simplify it, basically it's some of the best beef noodle soup you will ever have! The shrimp and pork spring rolls are really good as well. 

This place is also quick for lunch and the service is always good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Chandler...except on Tuesdays. 

My recommendations (in no particular order): spring rolls, iced coffee, seafood pho, \"S2\" - it's one of the stir fry options, and lemongrass chicken. 

Also, get there early (11am) if you're coming for a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"Clean and food is great! Staff are friendly but place is small. It gets busy during peak hours and not enough space. Overall great Phô and food! Always back for more."}
{"text":"We ate lunch at this restaurant on 10/16/2017.  They have excellent customer service.  We walked in and were seated immediately.   The restaurant was clean.  The menu had a variety of Pho soups and other items. My husband and I ordered the vegetarian pho and egg rolls.  

The soup was hot and so fresh.  The vegetables were cooked just right.  They started to get busy around 5:00 in the evening.  We will be back.  The prices are reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Awful pho! Don't believe the other reviews! I have eaten at many pho places and this one is probably the worst. I ordered the Pho Tai Bo Vien and the soup had almost no flavor to it. We also had the spring rolls which were disappointing as well.  The peanut sauce had very little flavor and the rolls itself were mediocre. Definitely not a place I will be coming back to."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places chandler. I always try something different and always love it. My favorite is the spring rolls!"}
{"text":"The pho is amazing taste just like it should I would give a five but the music playing is always foreign they do have a nice big screen but are never playing anything good put on sports or at least fox or cnn and it would be five stars also the waitress is very personal and friendly"}
{"text":"We just bought a house in Chandler and were looking for a local vietnamese restaurant. What do my fellow Yelpers say? Try out Pho Chandler!

I generally stick to the pho combinations with brisket, tendons and tripe. The service was super quick and within 5 minutes I had my steaming bowl of goodness which was a solid 4 stars (I have had better pho a couple of times). The beef brisket was tender and plentiful. The tripe was a little chewy but had plenty of flavor left in it. One of the pet peeves I have with some pho places is the quality of the bean sprouts. But at Pho Chandler, there was no problem. The sprouts were fresh and trimmed. My husband had the veggie pho which I didn't even know existed.

We are pleased we can get our pho fix so close to our new home. It is a clean restaurant and the service is good. The prices are on par with other pho restaurants."}
{"text":"One word - Exceptional!
Right when you walk into this restaurant, it's purely polite pleasant staff. 
Drinks- Thai Ice Tea YUM! You have to try it!
We started with the wings which are cooked to perfection with a sweet/ hot savory taste.
The potstickers, you can tell are homemade and delicious!
My husband had the Pad Thai : BEST he has EVER had!
I had the #10 Bun Bo Hue you can do different spice levels when asked at ordering . It's 1-5. I opted with 4 & it was a perfect level of heat for me.
My daughter got the chicken and broccoli and really enjoyed it. In fact, she wants to have her Birthday meal here which is coming up in two weeks!Wonderful dinning experience and we will continue to explore more on the menu. 
If you haven't tried this particular PHO, please do. It's a gem-hidden in the corner of what seems to be a slow moving shopping complex but, it's the perfect PHO place!"}
{"text":"We got there around 7pm on a Friday.  Our first Pho experience.   Saw the Google review, went with my gut, and didn't look at other sites (usually I do).  

It was busy, and only 1 or 2 tables were vacant.  A rush came right after us.  All types of people were there, old and young, and different ethnic backgrounds.  That's how you know it's good.  

Prices were reasonable.  Get a ton of food.  Great quality!  Service was very good, even when busy.  There were 3 of us.  We ordered Garlic Green Beans as an App, Pho dishes and a traditional Chinese dish.  Definitely, will eat here again!   I write reviews when the place is impressive."}
{"text":"Pho is definitely not one of arizona's specialties. 
Ive tried a few places here and there and have to say there is none like this place (and yes, they still receive 3 stars)

the workers are friendly but very...expressionless haha 
they are always responsive to annoying customer orders and/or complaints. Definitely work for the money

Only tried the pho noodle bowls. Whether you order the small or large, i feel they give you the same amount of noodles. You can even order a small and ask for it in a bigger bowl and they do it. 

The restaurant is small but clean. definitely gets busy at times. 

Overall satisfies pho cravings whenever I have them."}
{"text":"I haven't ever has something there I didn't like. Their pho is to die for. Love their wonton soup and spring rolls. They are always busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! 
The staff was so friendly and continuously ensured we were having a pleasant visit. The pho was so good and they had so many different sauces and condiments if needed.
I would recommend this place for a quick bite to eat or a random dinner or lunch. It is not a place to go on a date, but it's definitely worth visiting otherwise."}
{"text":"Woah dude this place is so slrppppably tasty I am so happy I want to eat this all the time I would like to thank the all the workers chefs, waiters ,host , cashiers working on Nov 17 at 8:00 p.m. for doing such an excellent job"}
{"text":"The pho broth by itself deserves 4 stars.  It's that good.  When the broth is that good, everything shines a little brighter.  

A couple of issues:

- The price is a little high for what is really a small bowl of pho
- The tendon is good, but it's hard to find and they don't give you much

That being said, the broth is excellent."}
{"text":"Once again we are back and the food and service was once again excellent . Pho tasty the spring rolls and egg rolls a must ! Very refreshing Ice tea to make a very nice diner tonight. Thanks and keep up the good service and food we will be back !"}
{"text":"The veggie spring rolls and vegetable soup is so good. The food is high quality and the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Very good PHO and excerpt friendly service ! The service was quick, the spring rolls were excellent, my house special pho was delicious!"}
{"text":"My wife always wanted Vietnamese food and after trying another pho restaurant in chandler, we have found our go to pho restaurant at \"Pho Chandler\" The food is tasty and the portions are adequate.  The service is excellent, always asking if we need something or continually filling our glasses."}
{"text":"Ordered the bun rieu and chicken pad Thai both were delicious!"}
{"text":"The place has always been a favorite of ours.  The food is very fresh and tasty.  The staff if friendly and is will to accommodate.
It can get busy and sometimes have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I come here for one thing and one thing only; the PHO! Holy crap, it's the best pho I've had in Arizona, this far. I hate how the restaurant is not as big as it should be, because they deserve to be a big place! The soup is authentic. It's not overly oily and it's fresh. The customer service is awesome, granted on a busy day it's a little slow, but when they have time, they treat you very good. I don't get anything besides the pho, but my party will sometimes get the Com Tam and everything is good, but it's really not broken rice, just regular rice. The bun looks good and from what I've heard tastes good too. Their thai tea is good and they give a reasonable amount! I always come to this place when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is a small place, simple, not fancy, but clean.  The service is fast and the portions are large.  For me it is close to home and very convenient because the service is fast and the meals can be healthy. Try the spring rolls!"}
{"text":"Trying to sniff the pho out! We decided to come here from reviews from Yelpers. Of course. How else would I know?
The spring roll was average. 
The pho broth was very good. But still does not beat my favorite pho joint  in San Diego. I'm a pho connoisseur and so is my hubby. We , hubby and I have clocked in so many bowls from west to east coast so we a good bowl when we taste it. 
Here my bowl of pho dac biet is a large no other option. The ratio is lots of broth, meat but easy on the noodles. I left most  broth back could not finish it. But then maybe it's bc the restaurant hardly have the AC on. It was hot ."}
{"text":"I really miss working close to Pho Chandler. When I worked in Chandler, I would go here for lunch 1-2 times a month for lunch. I usually get an order of spring rolls and the P2 with veggies. It's the best pho I've ever had. I'm pretty sure there are medicinal benefits to eating this soup. If you're looking for excellent Vietnamese food, this is the place."}
{"text":"We visit here all the time, and always get the spring rolls! Really good food, and great service."}
{"text":"Love Pho Chandler! I've been a customer for about 4 years - especially like Pho, curry chicken, spring rolls, and green beans. Service is friendly and fast - prices are reasonable... I'm a regular.."}
{"text":"Amazing! I prefer to dine in rather than take out just because of the way the soup works with adding all of the ingredients. Defiantly try this place!"}
{"text":"The place was very busy on a Sunday afternoon and we ended up sitting at the awkward bar by the entrance.

Started out with the Calamari which was pretty greasy and was feeling  I made the improper choice.   

I got the P1 and I have to say the meats were delicious with a hearty helping which can be hard to find as I've found a lot of places like to skimp but not these guys so I was happy with that.

On the down side the broth was on the weak side.  Not a lot of flavor or aromatics usually found in a good bowl of pho.  I couldn't sense any star anise or cinnamon.

The Noodles were very undercooked and kind of goo'd together.

Overall not a bad bowl of Pho but my search continues for the best bowl of pho in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Great Pho! Love picking up takeout here. I recommend the P2-pho with round steak. Staff is always very friendly, food is always hot and fresh... even when you're doing takeout. These guys really know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out...the spring rolls were good, but peanut sauce was so horrible I just threw it away. I ordered lemongrass chicken vermicelli it was o-k. Pretty spicy for 'mild' and very greasy/oily. Not good. The salad part was greased down and not much to it. Chicken was cooked well. Most likely won't go here again."}
{"text":"Had the everything x large pho very good there was some tasty oxtail in there, broth was pretty good noodles average, will try again if out that way not worth a crosstown trip though"}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times and had great service and delicious pho each time. This is my new \"go to\" for pho. It's busy but I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first ever bowl of Pho very much. The Spicy Beef Salad was also delicious."}
{"text":"Great food! Great staff! Place is nice, clean and well kept! The pho is pretty authentic. Also love their spring rolls, potstickers and fried rice. We keep going  back."}
{"text":"Stopped in Pho for dinner tonight and was quite impressed! Not only is the service phenomenal but the food was excellent.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this little restaurant. It's very clean and bright and the service is top notch! The food is always so fresh and smoking hot when it hits the table and most importantly? It's delicious!! My husband loves the Pho and I dream about the Crispy Lemongrass Chicken. The potstickers are great and so are the spring rolls. 

Pho Chandler really is one of my favorite local restaurants. 

And I can never say this enough: Please support your local businesses! They appreciate your business and it shows!"}
{"text":"We eat here regularly, we bring friends that are new to Vietnamese food and those who eat it regularly too.  We all agree - excellent, freshly prepared food for a great price.

The server /owner makes you feel at home and this place has THE best Pho, Bun, spring rolls etc.. 

You absolutely have to try the green beans and the Chandler rice dish -- SO good!  I highly recommend this place as it is the best Vietnamese place we've found in Arizona to date."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Vietnamese restaurant in Phoenix! From the moment I tasted the appetizers I knew I was in for a treat. Not only was the food good but the service was hands down the best I have ever experienced(age22)! I highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"It's no revelation that Pho Chandler has fantastic tasty Pho, and that its always packed when you go pick up your dinner Pho to-go.

What really bowled over my berries was their Pad Thai.  We've all had it somewhere.  I prefer Thai Dressing's version, or even Pei Wei's version to say Thai Rama's.  So I knows whats I likes...

The first thing that stood out to me, was the vermicelli noodles.  Much thinner than any other Thai place I've ordered from... and yes, I know this is a Vietnamese restaurant.  Maybe that's the difference... Viet Pad Thai uses angel hair.  I don't know, but I'm going with it.

While I momentarily considered it odd, I immediately found it an absolute delight.  And the prep work!  Yes, the prep work.  Everything was skillfully diced.  No chokey chicken pieces here, you know, the kind that are infamous for lodging in windpipes.

The taste was there.  The constancy was there.  I was there.  And if I have my way, I'll be there again tomorrow, ordering you know what.  Hey, why don't you meet me at Pho Chandler, and we'll satisfy that Pad Thai lover in you."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  Friendly, family restaurant. Clean. Monster bowls of Pho and super fresh ingredients.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is average food, definitely average Pho.

Not sure where all the great reviews come from. It must be for the nice people working there. Nice until you start mixing their foods together to get some flavors going. Very bland! The girl for upset with me for mixing the foods and verbalized her frustrations. Can't say I've ever experienced that before.

The spicy wings were covered in like a sweet n sour sauce of some sort.

I'd skip this place. Much better Asian food at Beijing in a Chandler and if you like Viet you would want to go to Cyclo."}
{"text":"I've never had pho before but I always see people raving about it. Today's rainy day made it the perfect time to finally try pho and Pho Chandler was the first thing that popped up on Yelp for pho, so Pho Chandler is where we went. As with trying any new food, I was nervous, but soon realized I really shouldn't have been. This place is AWESOME. The service is wonderful and the food came out in record time, piping hot and delicious. I had the pho with beef with an Thai iced tea and everything was wonderful. I'm so glad that I came here for my first pho experience and I'm certain that I'll be back in the near future! Be warned: the pho comes with cilantro. If you're anything like me and hate it, then order it without. I didn't realize it came with cilantro but even still, my bowl was amazing!"}
{"text":"We've been going to this restaurant a while, now, and it is, by far, the best Pho I've been able to find in the east valley. The green bean appetizer is wonderful, and my kid loves the pot stickers. Pho Tai is my fav, but their Pho Ga is also quite tasty. My teen loves the Beef Chow Fun, but gets adventurous with Pho from time to time. The ladies that work here all know us and generally know what we want before we do! Nice place to be a regular at."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot since I work at Intel. Go early to avoid waiting for a table.

PROS:
Quick service
lemon grass chicken lunch specials
good spring rolls and peanut sauce

good spot to introduce folks who have never had viet food before, pho isn't exactly like mom's, it never is"}
{"text":"It an okay place to go for pho... Nothing \"wow\" factor.... They're portions was more noodles and not enough meat... Not to mention very little herbs given"}
{"text":"I was scheduling a pho-date with my girlfriend, and she suggested that we needed to go to Pho Chandler.  I live all the way up in Central Phoenix and a 38-minute-drive to Chandler did not sound appealing at all, but she swore that it was the best pho place in the valley.  My friend, boyfriend, and I sat down and the waitress remembered my friend well, and I thought that was cool.  It is always a nice touch when the people working in an establishment try to remember you. 

I ordered a Vietnamese coffee and the others ordered glasses of orange juice.  My coffee came out quickly, but the juice took awhile.  I felt bad drinking my coffee and joked that they must be picking out oranges from a grove and freshly squeezing them.  And guess what?  They really came out FRESHLY SQUEEZED.  The sweetness from fresh oranges was worth the wait.  My friend and boyfriend were quite impressed and happy.  

As for the food, we ordered a plate of pan-fried potstickers (tasted very fresh as well), and all of us ordered their seafood pho which is their specialty.  The broth is made from snow crabs, and you do get pieces of the crab in your soup.  The crab is actually REAL in an ACTUAL SHELL and not the imitation kind.  The crab not only makes the soup more flavorful, but it adds a sweetness to the dish.  My boyfriend wanted to add an assortment of veggies to his pho, and the waitress made it happen with a giant heap of green vegetables.  

I would seriously recommend this place to everyone.  I have been dreaming about their seafood pho for the last three days and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with this place, I have been going for years. They have some of the best spring rolls in town! My personal  favorites include their stir fried noodles and the Pad Thai. To top it off the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Very good pho!  The pork and shrimp spring rolls are excellent!  It's usually pretty busy, but service is good."}
{"text":"Awesome traditional Vietnamese food, with great staff and quick service! Food is all fresh and of high quality. They even offer some Chinese dishes to vary the menu. Excellent place!"}
{"text":"Okay so I see tons of positive review....time to bring into reality...I am from oregon where there is a lot of good authentic asian food...including pho. We got the pho-nomenal soup bowl...dissappointing...asked for chilli oil..and they didn't have it and said sirachi sauce is all you need. Really? Even the shrimp rolls weren't tasty. Think quality though the price matches other pho places I being too. Please re-think and makes some changes. I will be 3 months to see if anything has changed. I hope you are reading this. The two stars are for great customer service...that is the only thing going good for you."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The lemongrass beef is awesome.  My 4 year old begs us to go so she can get the spicy green beans.  She eats the whole order by herself.  Great food, friendly staff, and always clean!"}
{"text":"I had their pho here. It was pretty much all water. When I order pho, I like to taste the broth. Their broth was too plain not much flavor. They gave me a little bit of noodles and not enough meat as if they were trying to save money on food. This place rated 4.5 stars which is why I came in the first place. I used their restroom and locked the door to wash my hands. While I was washing my hands, a lil boy opened the door. I guess their locks were broken. SMH! good thing I wasn't in the toilet. So be aware of that people when you're trying to do your business in there. That would have been embarrassing. Overall, the food was not all that great and service was ok. I didn't enjoy eating here at all. I'm sure I won't be back. There's other places that are much better than this for pho.."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night around 8pm. There was one booth available so we snagged it. 

Service - Service was quick. They had our water to the table before we were able to unroll our napkins and was ready for our order before we opened the menu.

Food - Potstickers were potstickers. I'll give them a few extra points however as they had just the right crisp. The accompanying sauce was the real winner. Spring roll was much like any spring roll you'd get at any other Pho joint. For the main course, we went for a spicy egg noodle with pork and beef. It was deeeeelish. We requested medium heat, and I would say it was more mild-medium, so definitely plan on talking your heat request up a notch. Overall, food was well prepared, clean and seasoned well.

Price - My wife and I had all that was reviewed above for less than 20 bucks. Can't beat that!!!

I'm giving this place 5 stars based on the service, price and my main dish."}
{"text":"Clean, good service, good food! Loved the wontons and Pho! I think it would be a little better if hey would add more meat to the pho though!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why they have really good reviews, it's the one of unpleasant Vietnamese food ever, the broken rice isn't broken rice, it was just jasmine rice, the B6 was not tasty at all, I can't taste much lemongrass flavor, the customer service was good, but there is a lot good Vietnamese food around this valley."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying my wife and I are huge fans of pho and Vietnamese food in general, and we've had pho across the country from New York to Los Angeles and San Diego.  In our opinion, Pho Chandler is the best Vietnamese restaurant in the Valley and will stand with the better ones anywhere in the country.  

The quality of the food is excellent, prices are reasonable, and service is efficient.  In terms of quality, the seafood pho, for example, has real crab and scallops, and how often can you say that about a pho place (most use imitation crab and no scallops).  The spring rolls are the best we've had anywhere, and the pho is consistently excellent."}
{"text":"It's good but bad service they are really rude but food it rotten food not amazing but just"}
{"text":"Edited 11:3/16. Order 2 #1's.  The soup was great, brisket was tough, and I got 2 sandwich bags of eye of round steak that was raw! Huh?


Pho was really good.  2 in our party ordered the P1 Pho.  They really like it.  Other orders included Wonton Pho & Chicken Pho. I wish that there was a platter filled with cilantro as well as the mint / sprouts. Spring rolls and fried calamari were very good!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best place to get pho! I go here when I'm craving pho or when I'm sick. Especially when I'm sick. The soup does the job! I would recommend this place to everyone out there looking for a good pho place. Only down side is that, the place is small. So on busy days, it's a long wait! I hope they can expand their place or location!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try another Vietnamese place other than Cyclo and friends suggested we try Pho. Well lesson learned. This place is no Cyclo period. The food was just OK and while the service was friendly enough I couldn't help but think it was all a pale imitation of the best Vietnamese joint in Chandler ... so if you are craving this type of food stick with Cyclo."}
{"text":"Great pho, fast service, what can I say it's our go to place in Chandler for Pho."}
{"text":"I've been back several times to have the Chicken Pho and have never been disappointed.  Great flavor and definitely on the healthier side for eating out."}
{"text":"This place is so good I actually crave it!  The servers are super pleasant and efficient. The pho is some of the best I've had. I like the one with vegetables and I add chicken. The vermicelli salad is fantastic. I like the #3 with egg rolls and bbq pork. And of course you have to get the egg rolls!  Fantastic service, reasonable prices and great food."}
{"text":"Spicy beef salad and pot stickers for appetizer"}
{"text":"How many places get better with age? Pho Chandler does. My family loves the restaurant but more so we love the way the staff welcomes us and takes care of us. They are truly a special group of people. 

We love the Veggie Pho and Veggie Spring Rolls."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing atmosphere, and attentive servers. Definitely recommend the fresh squeezed lemonade!! So good!! Definitely found my favorite pho spot in the valley!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch....I moved here about 6 months ago and this was my first attempt to find a Pho joint. I had my favorite back east ( Pho So 1 Richmond, VA). Very friendly greeting and a corner booth was mine. Its a small place with about 7 booths and 5 or so tables.
It was clean and inviting with large flat screen TVs.
I ordered the veggie spring rolls because im trying to eat better...they were good, probably because of the peanut sauce & sriracha. My meal was of course Pho....I couldn't decide between the chicken or veggie so they combo'd for me. The bowl was packed with noodles and veggies almost to a fault. I could even add the side toppers. The broth was hot and tasty but I like to sweat so I dosed it with sriracha and chili sauce like im used to doing. After one spring roll I could only eat half of my soup. They cheerfully provided to go containers. Making the soup a combo added $3 to what would have been a reasonable $6.95. You upsize to large for $1 or XL for $2. Not sure that would necessary as my regular was enough for two. All in all I'd go back if in the area but will also keep trying other places."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant several times and have enjoyed the brisket pho, the seafood pho and the spring rolls, all of which have been excellent. In addition I have found the price to be reasonable and the service to be both friendly and efficient. A server named Lisa is far and away the best server I've encountered however... Rob"}
{"text":"Very convenient to our location. Good has an authentic fill with good portions! I also enjoyed jasmine tea.
Love the spring rolls, egg rolls and the vermicelli bowls with Pork, beef, shrimp And egg rolls. The combo fried
Rice was also excellent. My new fav!!!"}
{"text":"Pho Chandler was agreed upon by the family while driving to get lunch. It was our first stop in but not our last. Lots of parking for a filled little restaurant. Staff was nice and service was quick. We started with some egg rolls and pot stickers. I ordered the chicken pad Thai and my husband ordered the pho. The pad Thai had great flavor, not very spicy for 4 star but the server did say it wasn't that spicy so I knew what to expect. It also had tofu which I loved as most places only will have the chicken. Portions were very big and I have leftovers for my husband and I. Prices are normal for a Thai restaurant. Great location and friendly faces will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing and authentic, great service and fair prices. Some of the better Vietnamese in Arizona."}
{"text":"Very good pho!  I will come again and again.  Really liked this place.  We were sat right away, and ordered some Gi Cun Chay orrrrr Veggie Spring Rolls.

They gave us extra Peanut sauceeeee cause I would bathe in that stuff if I could.

We picked three different soups steak, chicken and the beef meatball.  Fresh veggies and we couldn't get enough.  Enjoyed this place very much!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here once. As a vegetarian it had nice options.  We ordered the spring rolls which were lack luster (hence the 4 stars).  The pho was great and the portions were large! The service was excellent. Other than the rolls I would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, but food was delivered promptly. It seems as if this business don't value their customers. Food was alright- nothing special. Will not come back because of lack of friendliness."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here at least once a week. Not only is it healthy (for the most part), but it tastes amazing. Being Vietnamese fans, I'd say it's a huge step ahead of other local places. Another perk is the no cork fee for bringing your own wine and you can bring beer in if you want too. My favorite items include the Pho-nomenal, lemongrass chicken, and the pork chop dinner with egg and crispy rice with shrimp. Don't miss out on this one!"}
{"text":"Always friendly & on top of everything. Last 6 months I haven't been able to finish my bowl of pho, but now I can go back to being me...xtra large pho with spring roll & beef chowfun to go (sometimes I'll eat it here though). So glad I got my appetite back...lol.
Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"This is my most favorite pho hang out! The aroma of the food hits you as soon as you enter. The staff are very friendly and the food arrives very quickly. I have eaten pho at many restaurants but this one by far is number one"}
{"text":"I travel all the way from Scottsdale for their Chicken Fried Rice with a side of Sweet and spicy sauce!  #delicious"}
{"text":"We love this place. The pho is amazing and so addicting! Love getting the chicken and veggie combo. My husband loves the mint chicken extra spicy!"}
{"text":"Love the pho soup at Pho Chandler. I was first introduced to pho soup in Arlington, Virginia when a business colleague walked me up the hill in Arlington to a small shopping center with a two-window, single door restaurant that looked like nothing on the outside, but expanded inside to a near-warehouse sized room with long tables and family style seating. The place was crowded with blue collar, white collar, and families of all races. All waiting for and eating Pho soup. Pho is a Vietnamese noodle soup, primarily served with beef or chicken added. Well, the pho soup at this restaurant was so good I started eating there regularly. It was such a unique experience, that whenever we had out of town visitors, I would take them to this Arlington restaurant for their pho soup.   Ok, we moved to Arizona years later and have searched for years trying to find Pho soup as good as that back East. It wasn't until Pho Chandler opened that we found the flavored pho soups that we loved again. I now go to Pho Chandler regularly, and totally love their soups."}
{"text":"My friends brought me here to try pho for the first time. For weeks they said it was the best place to have pho. The service was fast and friendly. My friends were right, this place is amazing. I haven't doped craving pho ever since."}
{"text":"Need to update, because after all these years, this is still our favorite Vietnamese restaurant. Papaya salad is a favorite. Just tried the spicy beef salad for the first time, loved it.
Always had good service, fresh food!"}
{"text":"I've usually get the seafood pho and add extra veggies and it's really good! I've probably ordered from here 10 times in 6 months and it's been a hit almost every time, once the broth was bland but most of the time the broth is great. 

Potstickers are amazing! Spring rolls are great too! Not sure what else to add, this is our place for Pho and I also love that they give us a military discount! Not even \"In and Out\" gives a military discount so getting one from a Pho restaurant is fantastic! Thank you :)"}
{"text":"This place might actually be getting better and better the more I go in.  I only eat chicken pho so I limit my review to that dish, but I love it and I have been all over the valley looking for great chicken pho.  Pho Chandler, which conveniently being the closest to my house, is also the best place I  have found in the Phoenix area.  The people are super nice, it's a great family run restaurant (my favorites), and they are really great at making you feel welcome.  I often eat there alone, because I have this problem where I love chicken pho, and often don't have a dining partner when I am anywhere near Pho Chandler.  No worries, I feel fine there all by myself, perfecto!  When you actually get excited to drive 35 minutes through the desert on the interstate to get a bowl of chicken soup in the middle of August, in Arizona, there is something strange and special going on."}
{"text":"Maybe a 3.5, but I'm pretty sure it's not a 4.

Ordered spring rolls, pot stickers and pork fried rice (yes I know it's a Pho shop, just wasn't up to that today).

Spring rolls.  Not bad but kind of rubbery tasting.  The pork inside was good.  The shrimp kind of flavorless.  The peanut sauce it came with was so so.

Pot stickers were good.  The dipping sauce was very good.  Would have rather had that with spring rolls.

Pork fried rice was good but not remarkable.  On the other hand is fried rice ever remarkable?"}
{"text":"First time for Pho..loved it!!!  Had veggie pho + chicken, spring rolls and pork short ribs and all were excellent.  Will definitely be back....frequently."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town, always fast service, delicious! The soup never fails to be anything less than delicious, and I recently tried there hot wings which were a delicious appetizer. If I am ever in the mood for Pho this is definitely the place to come."}
{"text":"Went here with seven friends. We were greeted warmly. Staff has always been friendly and efficient. Everyone loved what they ordered. Food is well prepared, attractively presented and the portions are more than ample. Several of us had their S5 which consists of noodles, vegtables, shrimp, chicken and pork. Delicious combination. Others had a curry, chicken dish that they enjoyed. One had a pork chop dish that looked every interesting C3.  Nothing was left on their plate.
It's a small restaurant which can be busy at times but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things from my Vietnamese friends about how good and authentic this restaurant is..so I figure I'll try it with my foodie friends. 

The restaurant is very clean and well decorated. However, the service definitely needs work. When the waitress came over asking us what we wanted to drink, she didn't give us much time and kept asking \"what do u want? Water?\" over and over again. Feeling pressured, I decided to just stick with water. 

For appetizer, we ordered a veggie spring roll and pork spring roll. The veggie spring roll is a bit blend but the pork spring roll is rather good. However, I've had better pork spring roll elsewhere. 

For main course, I ordered Pho that has everything in it. The portion is very generous and I do love the broth. My friends seem to enjoy their dish. I did take a bite of my friend crap leg from her seafood pho and it was meaty & delicious. While I was still enjoying my meal, here comes the waitress dropping the check down (while we were still eating). When we paid for the check, they immediately asked me if I need a to go box when I am still eating my meal. That was when I called them out if they were trying to rush me out. I understand a local small restaurant such as this prefers to turn over the table quickly....but seriously don't be so bald and pushy about it. We are customers and we will pay and leave when we are ready. 

Overall, I think their food is decent (not spectacular) likes how others put it. I am hesitant to come back here due to the service I experience last night."}
{"text":"The vermiccelli was very bad, shrimps no flavor and boil versus gril, egg roll they cut it in small pieces and put it inside the soup, gross, I kept adding salt, salsa and other spices to flavor it and despite of it all, still, no flavor.
It is much beter the one in Mesa, Unphogettable, way better!!
2 stars because the service was good, and they didn't have Vietnamese iced tea."}
{"text":"I come in here every week for some delicious comfort food--a large bowl of Pho!"}
