{"text":"Good lord. SO surprisingly delicious!!   So this place is like a Food court type of setup. Went around 4pm on a Friday and ordered #7 Cantonese chow mein. They make it right in front of you!   Piping Hot, fresh ingredients, incredibly tasty, crispy noodles -- it sounds ridiculous but the Taste was comparable to a high end Chinese Restaurant. I asked them to make it spicy and add beef. I also got a spring roll and a Pepsi. Came to like $18 which is very high for a food court meal.  But the taste and quality was so good, it crushes normal Chinese fast food like Manchu Wok.   Will absolutely return."}
{"text":"This place is pretty foul...limited food in the inserts. Some of it looks days old. I ate it and was running to the toilet not long after... If you need your MSG fix, it does the job. Even though it was disgusting, I'll probably end up there again."}
{"text":"The thing that frustrates me about you Tiki-Ming, is that there is more than one of you; it doesn't make sense.  I had the lemon chicken and fried rice with spring roll special. I got fresh rice, loads of chicken and I thought it was gonna be legendary. I wish it tasted bad but it had no flavor AT ALL. I gave up on the rice and chicken; twas, too disappointing.. Oh and there was so much blubbery  FAT and cartilage in the chicken! So disturbing! I bit into the spring roll, and i knew immediately that this place did not give a fudge."}
{"text":"Reviewing fast food counters always feels a bit redundant to me as if it's bad, then the obvious answer is 'it's fast food in a food court, what do you expect?' But if it's good it just gets interpreted as 'it's good enough'. In reviewing Tiki-Ming, I'd say that it fits the latter.   The food court it's in is exceptionally clean. That's a rarity and while Tiki has nothing to do with that, it's appreciated.   The food is pretty good. It's food court, but if you go between 12-1:30, it's at its freshest and some of the non fried options are actually fairly tasty (see: Salt and pepper beef, chicken).   Staff is pretty friendly and they will offer you samples if you're trying to decide what to get.  The chow Mein noodles are boring but for some reason I really like them. Don't know what that says about me   Three items: $10. Not bad!"}
