{"text":"Cart service, all dishes $2 M-F. One of my faves. This is old school chinatown working man's dim sum with carts and traditional recipes. Service people are friendly, older and speak the village dialect so my mother just loves this place. I pretty much do too because it reminds me of the good old days when things were more relaxed and people ate food because they enjoyed the taste and not so freaked out about salt, oil, and msg. You will be fine if you drink lots of hot tea!"}
{"text":"Had dim sum in Toronto before and it was amazing so expected the same here but was very much disappointed. Flavours and textures were off and some things that should have been warm weren't. They also charged for tea which was the first time I ever had that happen at any dim sum restaurant."}
{"text":"It's my friend's favourite Dim Sum place so we have to go here when I'm having lunch with him in the Spadina area. It's located a few doors down from one of MY favourite Chinese restaurant, Asian Lengend. I'm not sure what it is about this place that makes Forestview his favourite restaurant. It's cheap maybe? This first time that we went, I paid for lunch and the bill came to $15 bucks total. We were stuffed!  It's an authentic Chinese restaurant with the cart ladies, the plastic table cloths and tables full of folks eating and enjoying their lunch. The cart ladies try their best to understand what you want. They also have manager types standing at attention to make sure that everything is running smoothly.   **It's very loud which I don't mind, I just thought that it's worth mentioning in case you want something a bit more quiet**"}
{"text":"Some of the worst Dim Sum I've ever had.  The place is relatively cheap and of the few places left in Chinatown with traditional cart service so maybe that's why people still go there.  Both the Har Gow and Chung Fun featured tasteless shrimp that was either very old or had been frozen way too long.  The rice flour used for them was so poorly done that it was a thick, almost unedible goo when we tried them.    The Siu Mai were blobs of poorly cooked meat that didn't even hold their shape in the bamboo steamer.  The fried Turnip Cake had some extra stuff in it, but was cold by the time it got to our table and we had no idea what was in it since the flavour was so bland.  These guys should learn from Seafood Dim Sum King across the street and have a separate table at the front that freshly fries up things like the Turnip Cake right in front of the diners.  Anyway, the good reviews here are obviously from people who have no access to good Dim Sum like the vast array of places in Markham, Richmond Hill and Scarborough.  Either that or they work with Homer Simpson at a faulty nuclear power plant and their taste buds have been permanently neutralized."}
{"text":"disgusting, and I don't use that lightly.  came here for dim sum with my partner. we heard they had cart service. it was a week day outside of regular lunch or dinner hours.  the stairway up is incredibly dirty, just covered in dirty and debris. when we got upstairs, we noticed the standard full table of staff/family eating their lunch, and otherwise a huge empty room. we were greeted by a man who took our order from print-out sheets of paper. no cart service.  looking around, it was startling how dirty the place was. lots of mirrored surfaces covered in smears... stained, mouldy, dusty carpets. a sane person probably would have left. our plates came out looking like they hadn't been properly cleaned (but i understand this is how restaurant plates look after much wear and tear).  we noticed our waiter making our dim sum on a little stove-top in the back of the dining room. um, okay. clearly re-heating some cold pre-made food but I'm no fool and know that dim-sum is usually pre-made. a few items were really bad but dumplings with ginger were delicious. but... cold on the inside.   service was  attentive enough but we had to walk ourselves to the front to pay our bill. here's where it got outrageous. our server handed us over to some young woman, who would NOT TAKE HER EYES OFF A MOVIE ON HER SMARTPHONE. for every moment of the exchange - taking our card, running it, grunting to ask if we wanted a receipt - she was GLUED to her movie.   things in the service industry have gotten HORRIBLE when you take so little pride in your business that you allow your staff to WATCH A MOVIE in the face of your  customers. Do you hate your customers?"}
{"text":"Went there around 2pm, cart service was over so just ordered off  paper. The food was very disappointing. The beef tripe's flavour was off, just tasted like MSG and salt. The tofu dessert not only came out broken into small pieces but also tasted grainy. In the end we ordered only 4 plates and bill came up to $24. Apparently tea was $1 extra per person which is ridiculous because none of the dim sum places in Chinatown charge for tea."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service was very good and Not slow like it use to be. People were friendly. Place was clean. Price was fair.  Most customers were seniors.  The place is old and has not change in many years.  Do not expect too much if you are going to an old restaurant like this in Chinatown."}
{"text":"When we got there they never gave us the menu and we had to ask them for the menu. They assumed we only wanted dim sum. We ate some dim sum and ordered about 4 other main dishes. When I asked the waitress about low mein with the big noodles he seems mad at me for asking. All the main dishes did not taste good at all! The dim sum was decent. Here comes the good part...they uses like a trash bag type of material as a table cloth and when ppls are done eating with all their dishes still on the table like spoons, forks, plates, hot tea pot, they grab all the sides of the table cloth like it's a trash bag and just throws it for the dish washer. I really feel bad for the dishwasher. I ran out of drinking water and ask the waiter for more and he just ignored me. I had to ask again..seems like he heard me but just ignored me and was a bit angry. When we was about to leave the waitress did not even have our bill ready. Very bad service."}
{"text":"This is my favourite all-day Dimsum place in Chinatown!   The place is spacious, the food is good, the price is low, and the best part is that they serve a great selection of dimsum items ALL DAY! So no matter when you're craving these tasty little breakfast items, you'll have a place to fulfil your cravings.   However, don't expect too much in terms of service which I think is typical to Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"*2.5*  Apparently everyone had the same brilliant idea of going to Dim Sum on a stat holiday. Rol San was lining up out the door like some happening nightclub, so we were left to find an alternate dim sum joint. Found this badboy in an extremely dim and unpleasantly lit second floor space (where was the Forest View that the name suggests??? There was only one window in the entire place, overlooking beautiful Dundas Ave).  Part of me wanted to run out cringing due to the unaesthetic lighting and decor, but I remained, half crawling out of my skin. The short wait, friendly cart ladies and decent food did help redeem the place a little bit. I would just say that while none of the food items were exceptional, they manage to faintly fill that dim sum craving. Items were fairly priced ($2 small, $3 medium, $3.5 large).   Biggest plus: congee cart! And I just want to mention that some of the cart ladies are super charming and cute in an old-dim-sum-cart-lady kind of way. They would've made excellent flight attendants.  Atmosphere - 1/5 Service - 3/5 Food - 3/5 Price - 4/5"}
{"text":"Only tried the dim sum here. Came here today because the wait at Rol San was a 1 hour wait. This hungry couple was not waiting, so we went up the road to try this place out. This place is cart style dim sum place and we were seated right away (they were about 75% full during peak brunch period). The restaurant is very large and roomy. Everything looks kind of old, but relatively clean.   The cart ladies were all nice and the service was pretty good for a chinese restaurant, the food was ok, a bit bland but seems clean. The main gripe I had is that the food was not pipping hot since it has been rolling in the carts, which I presume does not have an adequate heating system. I like my dim sum hot, not lukewarm.  The bill was about $30 total, we ordered about 10 dishes for two people, and we were stuffed."}
{"text":"This is one of the oldest Dim Sum restaurants in Toronto. It may not be as glamorous as the ones in the burbs but it is old school and good. Large variety and inexpensive. Fresh and a show. Sing song cart calls and a mad dash to fill you up."}
{"text":"Like the food and it's our regular weekend Dimsum place. Cart ladies are friendly and I think it's very ethentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"I didn't come here to eat, I came here to not eat. I also apparently came here to sweat a lot and get my face vibrated off from wicked bass.   It was for the Machine Drum show and I guess it was an interesting venue to have it at, but it was big enough and had a dance floor. The door man, whom I later found out was actually Cory Feldman, was sort of nice, not too pushy. I went up and gave my ticket and went in. They had some sort of buffet style set up of drinks and Chinese foods along one side of the place as the people started filtering in. I had a J&B on the rocks as per usual, prices not too bad actually. Food was $5 and drinks were $5.   There were a lot of tables in the dark sides  of the space so you could sit down and hold hands and kiss people on the cheek which are my favourite things to do.   FAST FORWARD to the show actually getting to the good parts. It got packed in there pretty quickly and the lineup to the bathroom seemed to be endless. Everything was fine until the overhead vents or fans or whatever stopped working and it got extremely hot and sweaty. A lot of people in terrible haircuts with terrible attitudes and ugly designer t-shirts but that's not a fault of the venue as I like to say. And what the hell is a Sparkle Project? Anyway I literally had to drag my lesbian neighbour outside to cool down and partake in a hookah with Shawn Desman and K-Os. Someone swearing loudly to a loved one on the phone prompted us to go back inside where it seemed the ventilation system started working again and I could finally break out my signature dance moves. These include swaying my arms side to side and touching my face seductively.   On the whole I enjoyed the venue but the overcrowding kind of killed my near black-out tipsiness, as did the heat and rude people. I certainly wouldn't go there to eat a meal or do my dry cleaning."}
{"text":"Went here with my family during brunch (~11-12pm) on a Sunday. I grew up eating at different dim sum restaurants in the GTA Chinatown. I never ate dim sum in Asia so my \"dim sum palette\" standards are not high.  Food: The dim sum here was good and tasted the way that I am used to it tasting (my grammar is horrible), nothing different about it that made me feel unfamiliar towards the dishes. Had the har gow, shumai/ shaomai, lotus leaf rice, crispy fried squid, rice noodle rolls, tofu skin roll, and phoenix claws.  Atmosphere & Service: The tables and utensils were clean. Service was good, the servers call out the name of the dish that they are carting (is this the proper word?).  Pricing: I can't comment on this unfortunately, my parents handled the bill and I did not bother to look at it, maybe next time.  You could say this review is based solely on their food."}
{"text":"Dim sumwhere else if possible. This restaurant is pretty typical of many of the dim sum establishments in Chinatown.  Stained old carpets that have probably never been cleaned.  The menu has the same items you find anywhere else.  However, not all places have dim sum all day. So, by the time we all rolled out of bed, and met in China town,  it was later in the afternoon.  By the time we were finished our meal they were actually setting up for dinner.  If you want dim sum and it's late in the day, this place has it! Don't expect anything exciting! The carts stop around 2pm, but you can order off the dim sum menu.  The staff is actually very friendly!  But, the food is mediocre at best.  deep-fried squid =  soggy tentacles chicken wings = dry and overcooked sticky rice = too small Etc. Meh."}
{"text":"Back again this morning (sunday) at 8:30am , about 40 people in the place we waited half hour for cart service to start.  Drank tea and read newspaper, like everyone else.  Same crowd as before. Older Chinese couples, waiting for the hot of the press congee and steamers.  The order:  Sui Mai - perfect hot, sooo fresh $2 Chicken Feet - lovely red black bean sauce, flying of the cart with the crowd at this time in the morning $2 Spareribs - lovely garlic steamed sauce and not fatty $3 Bean Curd roll (meat one) - perfect gooey goodness $3 Har Chueng Fun - Sweet soya over lovely noodles, shrimp not as good.  morning crowd all having beef one $3.50 Noodle in soup - The best dish, broth so flavourful, perfect pork dumpling - she gave us about 20 strips of ginger in soup and the splash of red vinegar $3.50  Jasmine tea x 2 pots.  $17 today, don't know why but they didn't charge for tea or tax, we paid cash. $3 tip.    love it!!  note: we took some friends at noon a few months ago not as good, i think this early morning thing is the way to go  note 2: free parking on dundas till 1pm if you can get spot."}
{"text":"Good for dim sum when downtown as they are casual and the food comes quickly. The food is tasty with the deep friend shrimp rolls being a stand out - crispy, piping hot and absolutely delicious with the dipping sauce along side. The spare ribs were dangerously addictive although they were about half fat so you have to eat around the fat to get to the meat.  Many large groups of people descended on Forestview while we were dining and the kitchen did an admirable job of rolling out huge quantities of very attractive and fresh looking dishes, including fish with many others enjoying their soup that day. Luckily our waiter did not seem to understand English as I asked for something not on the dim sum menu with my eyes being bigger than my stomach, so keep that in mind if you are not simply ticking items from the dim sum menu. We will be back to Forestview!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst food I've ever had. Tea was disgusting and came out black. Food was cold and flavorless staff were unfriendly.  We spent 5 minutes here and after trying a few things we left. Absolutely would not recommend this place ever. When we left our bill was $21 between 3 people and they made a point in asking for a tip. We decided to go to another restaurant to actually have a decent dim sum experience.    Here's your tip: fire your staff and shut down."}
{"text":"Everything fried here has that taste of oil that should have been changed some time ago.  It's not as bad as a roadside fish fryer in rural Scotland, but you can still taste that same taste.  It's the taste of regret.  Regretting that you didn't go to Rol San one block to the north or or New Treasure a few blocks East.    Har Gow just tastes kinda wrong.  Baby Bok Choi is pretty good, but come on, we're grasping at straws now.  Even the tea here doesn't taste as good as most places."}
{"text":"I was here for a banquet, and all I can say is that this is really OLD SKOOL chinatown.  It reminded me of my childhood when there weren't as many options as there are today.    There is really no attempts at modernizing anything, from the menu, to the service, to the holy F$#@ what kind of bathroom is this?  Sadly, I can't say I know of too many middle of the road price range type Chinese banquet places in downtown Toronto, the only real option seems to be high end at the Metropolitan.  It seems to be either Scarborough, Markham, Richmond Hill or bust.  If this is the best view of the Forest, I might have to chop down all the trees."}
{"text":"After watching the Toronto episode of the Layover on Saturday, our goal was to hit up one of the tasty restaurants Anthony Bourdain spoke about during the show.  The last time we had dim sum was in San Francisco over a year ago, so Dim Sum it was!  We made the 40 minute trek to Chinatown and went to Forestview Chinese Restaurant.  The place was packed, but luckily we were sat right away.  This was my 1st experience at a Dim Sum restaurant where the carts just roll by and you don't get a menu. The first cart strolled by us about a minute after we sat down.  Unfortunately we didn't understand the women who were pushing the carts too well.  They pointed...we pointed... they said it was good... we sometimes said yes.  Sometimes it worked out, sometimes it did not.  One case where it didn't, some type of squid dish?  Not really sure.  But it was fishy and a little tough, boo.  One dish we were 100% certain of what it was, chicken wings.  They look plain, but man were they delicious!  They were super crispy and juicy.  They had great flavor, but I couldn't pick out what it was.  They were devoured pretty quickly.  What we thought were spring rolls were shrimp wontons, this was definitely one the better dishes. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and the wrap was super crispy without being greasy.  We took a risk on these dumplings, which had an oniony shrimp filling.  The wrap was very gelatinous!  The flavor was good, but the texture totally threw me off, blech.  Some shrimp that went by looked promising but were bland.  Our last dish was Pork Shumai was one of the things I understood... done!  It was a good ending to a decent meal.  Forestview was a very interesting experience, but I don't think we will be returning.  The food wasn't that great, and the language barrier made it hard to figure out what was being carted around.  But I'm glad we went this one time."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name Forestview even though it conjures up images of a funeral parlor or a nursing home.    My buddy and I stopped in here on Sunday because we saw the all-day dim sum sign.  My buddy's family is from Shanghai and he speaks fluent Mandarin, otherwise I don't think we could have gotten a table that quick because it was packed with hordes of Chinese families - a sign that it's a good place, otherwise the Asians would steer clear of it and leave it to the white devils.    The dim sum was great: my favorites being the chicken and duck feet.  Only problem I find is due to my own fault, because we take too much and items get cold.  The service was good and the prices were great, considering how much we ate."}
{"text":"Dim sum? More like DIM DON'T. On weekends, it's a zoo. I have no idea why this place is so packed, it's pretty forgettable as far as dim sum is concerned. There are tables (like the one they made my dining companion and I sit at last weekend) that the carts don't reach, so you have to physically get up and look at the dim sum lady's cart offerings every time one comes nearby. What a pain. Service is even worse than your typical dim sum place -- don't even think about getting your drink refilled, or getting extra hot mustard to dip your dumplings in. The dumplings themselves are nothing special. Hit up any other dim sum place instead."}
{"text":"We were hungry after spending a few hours visiting the AGO for the Bowie exhibit, so walked to Chinatown looking for Dim Sum. Rol San was packed so we thought we'd try a new place. I won't go so far as to say it was a mistake; we didn't get sick or anything. It wasn't a good choice either.  Service was slow or non-existent. The options on the dim sum carts were limited. The few items we did choose to eat weren't very good. Bland. Not worth it.   We left after having only a couple of dishes. Disappointing."}
{"text":"So here's the deal...I'm from out of town (MN), which is a desert for #legit dim sum.  When I hit dim sum...and I hit it HARD...I expect propane steam carts with old Chinese ladies pushing'em (yelling at you!), the smell of excess propane in the air and a slightly dodgy interior (reminds me of HK dim sum).    I found this place (thanks Google Maps!) in the heart of \"Chinatown\" on Dundas Street.  Got lucky and found a place to park a block away...and we quickly made our way to glorious dim sum!  Our flight got in around 12:30pm and arrived around 2pm...not bad considering customs, traffic and the parking situation.  Dim sum is all-day and given out off-hours arrival, we were seated quickly.  Within minutes of hitting the chair, the first cart rolled out and we hit the usuals...shrimp and pork dumplings, chive dumplings, BBQ pork buns, pot stickers, phoenix claws, spare ribs, congee and a couple others I don't know the English name for!    What I loved about this place is everything was piping HOT, not cold...items didn't fall apart as you try to pick it off the bamboo container...all great signs of legit dim sum.  My mouth is watering just writing this...sigh...I wish this place was in Minneapolis/St.Paul!!!  If you're in T.Dot...find your way to Dundas Street and hit this place up!"}
{"text":"Fresh and wonderful.  Pushed carts around room so I didn't have to guess want I liked.  Had most every thing on menu and was delicious and hot. We were one of few westerners there (which I viewed as a favorable sign). Big room of 200+ was all full for Sun lunch and service was reasonable. Other reviews likely represented language barrier.  We enjoyed and will very likely be back in this crowded \"dim sum\" area."}
{"text":"It seems like this is one of those \"love it or you don't\" kind of experiences, and so the controversy continues.   I have been here many times for weekend brunch as reasonable dim sum in the city is far and few between. Forestview seems iffy at first as you enter through the small glass doors and hit a staircase, but after you climb that flight of carpeted stairs the room opens up unexpectedly to a large floor. The restaurant has push carts in abundance from 11-1:30 and is usually quite packed with patrons (mostly of the Chinese variety) which is a good sign. I enjoy the carts because you can start eating within seconds of arriving. They have a good selection of options wheeled around by singing ladies but some items such as fried crab claw, deep fried taro balls, and a couple others aren't always available. The food itself is very tasty from the fresh Har gow, the shrimp and chive dumplings and the stuffed eggplant, to the steaming congee. The prices are also incredibly reasonable at something like $2/small $3/M and $3.50/L dish. The waitresses are also always honest with the items they check off and don't try to pull one over on you. Service can be a little dodgy but the wait staff is attentive to your needs once contacted...they speak English.    Just and FYI, the pushcart staff are not servers! So if you want something make sure it's the waiter you talk to."}
{"text":"i don't see why this place got such a low review......  After eating in Scarborough, Markham, this OLD Chinatown was the best of all meals....  This place is on the 2nd floor, referred to us by people I randomly stopped in the friendly streets of Toronto Chinatown....we were not disappointed.....  The carts come around as usual, we ordered and they brought us water tea and refilled as needed.....  Everyone was quite nice, they at least smiled....  The one thing that we learned there was when we paid the bill, we are accustomed to leaving the tip on the tray or folders or just on the table after we have received our change.....here, it is different, they pay the tip with the bill, at least that is what they told us.....or maybe they just saw my sister putting away all her large bills and thought she wasn't going to leave a tip......  all in all, great place for a family lunch and it was Mother's Day..."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing food with really pushy servers...  The FOOD:  All your standard dim sum items.  I never really expect luxury or super-fresh quality at dim sum, but Forestview seems to suck the flavor out of everything. Most of the dishes were dry, bland, or a bit on the cold side.  The best flavor was the siu mai, the ubiquitous pork dumplings which were thankfully devoid of gristle.  The lo baak guo (turnip cakes) were gooey, the lo mai gai was nearly flavorless, and the har gau the most boring dumping ever tasted with a sad shrimp inside of an overly thick wrapper.  Overall, pretty bland and boring.    The SERVICE:  All the standard old Chinese ladies pushing the carts, but they were more aggressive here than anywhere I've ever had dim sum.  Practically forcing dishes on the plate, the women would shout \"very good...must try\".  Even with some rudimentary command of a few words in Mandarin and Cantonese it was tough to handle.  I know dim sum has fast-paced service, and the waitstaff are not known for pleasantries, but this was downright unpleasant.    The ATMOSPHERE:  I don't get it with the plastic table cloths.  I cannot think of a less classy way to set or clear a table.  Cheesy chinese decor.  No sign of a forest though!  OVERALL, towards the bottom end of dim sum I've experienced in my life.  It's cheap, but you won't really enjoy the food or the service."}
{"text":"Coming here during off-peak hours, I knew it was totally wrong.   All-day dim sum places are usually pretty bad.   We were the only people there. That's pretty bad.   There were no carts. We just ordered via paper. That just ruins the whole dim sum experience.   This place forever ruined Toronto Chinatown for me.   My friends rated the food 2 out of 10. Shameful."}
{"text":"surprisingly in Toronto, they have many good chinese restaurant. this place is included. they have a great food. I went there for dim sum and they have a traditional dim sum, where people walk around with cart of foods and you can tell them if you want it or not. hakau and siumai (just ok), other place have a better one. chicken feet, this one have a great flavor, love it Egg custard was great. hot and fresh I order other dishes and they all rated from ok to great. none so far have a rated of bad. I got seated next to the kitchen so I had an opportunity to grab most of the food the coming out fresh from the kitchen.  The place was packed and like a zoo. this is what dim sum place supposed to be. so if You want to get a good dim sum and see the place like a zoo. you found one."}
{"text":"I am sure that there are better places in Markham and Richmond Hill, but in terms of convenience, you can't really go wrong with Forestview.   Is it the best dim sum I've ever had?  No, and yeah the portions are a bit small...but!  1. They have carts!  What KILLS me is when dim sum places do not have the carts but resort to the menu.  Yeah I know, Shanghainese vs. Cantonese-style dim sum...but I love my carts.   2. The prices are reasonable.  Dim sum isn't really meant to be super expensive.   3. The har gao, shui mai, char siu bao, ham sui gau, cheong fung, lo mai gai, seafood congee and etc were all fresh and tasty.   4. The service, including the ladies pushing the carts, is very good!  If you need a drink, extra mustard, have a question, or your bill, the staff is very accommodating.   I hope they stop renovating soon and reopen!!"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good, and the portions were much larger than in NYC! It's on the second floor, and while it could do with some upgrading, it still looked all right. It seems like this place has been here a while with its wear and tear, and many elderly folks frequent this place. I definitely feel like it's underrated. It isn't a tourist hotspot, but I think that gives this place a but of authenticity you wouldn't get otherwise!  As for service, the staff was very kind and the women pushing the carts around we're friendly as well. They seemed a bit pushy when trying to get you to try food, but if you stand your ground you won't get pushed around too much!  This place isn't too special, but it would be somewhere I'd go back to."}
{"text":"Meh.  Bland and boring ... truly, for me it tasted like Cantonese hospital food (not that I have ever been in hospital in Guangzhou).  Staff are very nice, though.  Have given them more than just a few opportunities to convince me but unfortunately I did not like the food there."}
{"text":"Be Sure to Check Your Bill Before Paying  Occasionally if I can't get a table quickly at the excellent Rosewood Chinese Cuisine on Dundas Street for DIM SUM I will go across the street to Forestview. The food is not bad -fresh, steaming hot and restaurant is loud with chatter which is to be expected of a DIM SUM restaurant. Trying to get the attention of servers can be an issue. Rosewood, on the other hand, has a smaller staff yet I can always get a server to help me out. The prices are comparable at both Forestview and Rosewood though I say that with some reservation. Let me explain. My experience at Forestview when paying is to know which waiter to avoid. During the weekdays the prices are (supposed) to be Happy Hour rates. One waiter (older gentlemen with glasses) always marks up the prices during my visits. For instance I ordered 9 DIM SUM items and after he wrote up my bill I asked \"what happened to the Happy Hour pricing?\" He scribbled on the bill again and this time it was 1/3 off the total. He has done something similar twice before in the past -I didn't check my bill until afterwards. There are some decent waiters at Forestview. A younger, thin, waiter (with glasses) is very helpful. When I ask for something he always remembers -works harder than other staff IMHO. I can always trust him to correctly write up my bill."}
{"text":"Extremely authentic dim sum!  We went for a wonderful Saturday morning dim sum, and the place was packed with the predominant language being Chinese (which did make it difficult for us at first). Still, plenty of hot tea and assorted hots trays later we were pleasantly stuffed."}
{"text":"I'll say 2.5 star, I would probably go back, but ONLY because there are feck all downtown dim sum options to begin with.  They have CARTS if that is your thing. I personally dislike it. I find the stuff that comes off carts is never as fresh as places where you just order and it comes straight from kitchen to table.  Service is pretty cruddy. You are seated and given tea, but there's no condiments out on the table or anywhere to be seen. We had to get up and ask for chili oil, hot sauce and soy.   In the meantime, we sat down and within 30 seconds one of the cart ladies was piling our table with items from her cart. We had to sit with 3 kinds of dumplings (har gow, siu mai and the pork & chive ones) just sitting there for 10 mins, because we couldn't eat them until we got our hands on some sauces to dip them in.   Har gow, pork & chive and some fried dumplings we tried were all decent. The siu mai was good but VERY salty for some reason. I kind of love saltiness but they were definitely more salty than usual.  We also tried the eggplant here which was the best I've ever had. It wasn't nearly as greasy as other places I've tried it.  Price is fairly cheap (for downtown). We paid $19 bucks for the 5 items we ordered (tax included)   Rol San is better."}
{"text":"Although most people prefer the traditional dim sum restaurants with carts, I am one who prefers the paper ordering. This is probably because I enjoy eating dim sum at dinner which most people raise an eyebrow at. Its hard to find a lot of places that serve dim sum at all hours of the day in downtown Toronto since this isn't normal dim sum protocol, but I like coming back to here.  There isn't much to report in terms of its uniqueness. We are often eating in there with only a couple other tables at 7pm on a Friday, but the food is really good.  The one dish that keeps me coming back is their fried shrimp and port dumplings. There is a crispiness to them I have not tasted in other fried dumplings. Its hard to describe in words why they are different, so the only option is to try it.  One knock I have on the dim sum is that the paper's English descriptions of dishes are very vague, and so its hard to know what you are ordering until it comes out."}
{"text":"All day dim sum - how awesome is that??  I always get stressed missing dim sum time, so this was perfect.  Walked in, and was immediately greeted.  Ordered Chrysanthemum tea and took a seat by the aisle.  Sweet elderly ladies walked by with their food laden carts - we had the har gow, shu mai, spring rolls, and sticky rice.  The delicious fried donut wrapped in rice noodles (see picture) - you need to order that separately.  Bill total - $19! Crazy good."}
