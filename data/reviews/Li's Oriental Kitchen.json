{"text":"Found this place online, as I was at work, looking for cheap Chinese food in Etobicoke. I remember going here when it was Ho Li Chow, many years ago. I found that they had $6.99 lunch specials that included an egg roll and pop. So for the price, I figured why not? 

I went in, it's only a place for take out, which didn't bother me, as that's what I was there for anyway. I ordered the Lunch special #2 - szechuan chicken, and got them to make it extra Spicy. Didn't take too long to make, I waited about 5-7 mins at most. 

So I got back to work and dug in. There was a ton of food in the styrofoam container. It looked good. The food was average, it's typical greasy chinese food. But I did like the added spice, it had a nice kick to it. I was impressed that they offered Chicken fried rice with the meal, and that there was plenty of chicken in the rice. For the price though, it was great. I had 2 meals out of this, and that makes me happy!

I have been back a few times since my original visit. Li's is a good bang for your buck. Decent food at a great price."}
{"text":"The food was terrible, when I called asking questions about their restaurant and the man on the phone wont stop yelling at me.... never going back there again"}
{"text":"I find this to be the best option for the area. Always fast (& free!) delivery and you definitely get your money's worth. Impressed with the amount of chicken in the chicken fried rice and other side dishes."}
{"text":"Food here used to be pretty good, for a Chinese takeout, but we recently placed an order online, and noticed the quality has gone downhill. 

Food is still edible, but nothing compared to what it used to be 2-3 years ago. One good thing, though, is that the order was delivered promptly, complete, and exactly as it was made. If you're not too picky, you will enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"In an attempt of furthering my Etobicoke delivery lunch options, I came across Li's Oriental Kitchen and our group was pretty satisfied in our experience. 

We ordered a variety of lunch specials and a few mains. The lunch specials are an egg roll, 1 item of varying options (spicy chicken, spicy beef, sweet & sour chicken balls, chicken chop suey, lemon chicken, or chicken wings to name a few options), a large portion of chicken fried rice, and a can of pop. For $6.95 and the sizeable portion of food that came, its a fair deal and the only complaint my group had was that the spicy chicken wasn't actually very spicy.
The General Tso Chicken was a bit on the bland side as well, but still a decent portion for its price and with a healthy portion of hot sauce met my lunch needs. Egg Foo Yong got a great review though and was pretty impressive looking. 

Free delivery on local orders over $20 pre tax, and the delivery was prompt. 
This place might be closer to 3.5 stars, but admittedly not being wowed - I'm staying at 3 for the sake of this review, as it was just A-OK."}
{"text":"My favorite \"Chinese\" food in Etobicoke. The chicken fried rice is very good because of the big chunks of chicken they put in. They are always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Just ordered from JustEat and ate an embarrassing amount of Chinese food for two people. However, no complaints at all. Very yummy, just what I expected, and awesome portion sizes for the price. The BBQ spare ribs were awesome and the chicken fried rice was actually the best I've had in a long while. Also, my boyfriend loved the veggie szechwan noodles. Food came warm and timely AND IT WAS VERY WELL PACKAGED (it's a pet peeve of mine when it comes lop-sided or spilling over -- it was packaged in the bags perfectly. Definitely our new go to Chinese spot."}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese I've had. 

We ordered the family meal for 3: chicken fried rice, beef lo mein, chicken balls, chop suey and egg rolls. The chicken in the chop suey, the beef in the lo mein and they chicken in the rice was so slimy and wet. It has no seasoning. We threw most of it away. Only thing that was tasty was the actual rice and the egg rolls. 
Will not be back. 
Was not satisfied to say the least."}
{"text":"Good food reasonable price. Ordered one of the specials but there was very little meat. Tasted good for a quick fix of fast ethnic food. I would go back."}
