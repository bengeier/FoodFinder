{"text":"Very good happy hour Monday through Friday from 5-7pm.  Nice draft beer selection was well."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait for my husband to try the wings here as I remember them being incredible way back when!  Unfortunately, we were beyond disappointed.  The wings were overcooked and rubbery, and the chicken in our quesadilla was the same.  It saddens me that the pride of the kitchen staff is nonexistent in a place that once had a reputation for amazing eats."}
{"text":"This place often smells like a funeral home. Especially in the restrooms. It tends to get real smokey, which sucks. The bar is horribly uncomfortable. Just a weird setup with a metal pole separating you from the bar top. The bar stools all seem to be falling apart too. The food is below par.  But the beer is cheap and that's what you go here for. After a few rounds the quality of the food is a non factor."}
{"text":"Simply put, never again. Service is awful. Took 45 minutes before we could get a waitress to our table and a total of just short of 1 1/2 hours before our food. Then some of the food was just warm and some was actually on the cold side. Oh and not all of the food made it.  The Perrytowne fries were sad to say the least. The ranch dressing is nasty. Don't know what watered down brand it was but tasted like mayonnaise and water mix. A hamburger ordered well done was medium rare at best. You shouldn't have to constantly flag down your waitress. Not once did anyone stop and ask if we needed anything, ask how things were, check on drinks or to find out that we didn't even get everything. There is much better service and quality food in the area. I wouldn't even classify it as good bar food."}
{"text":"Sat to eat, waited 20 mins then went to the bar for service. Was served beer in a cracked draft glass and then waited another 30 mins for someone to come take our food order. Noone came. They compt the 2 beers and we left."}
{"text":"Ownership is garbage....drafts taste like garbage....atmosphere is garbage. Food is absolute garbage.. If you go in because they are advertising half off ALL drinks just know that your tab will be full price unless you are ordering bottom shelf liquors because the whole establishment is garbage. Place sucks just stay away from this shithole at all costs"}
{"text":"Dirty.  Ended up leaving after 25 minutes of waiting for someone to take our drink order.  Our supposed waitress was too busy on her cell phone to work.  Keep in mind it was not crowded.  Will never go back.  We left without even ordering a drink.  Went elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was always a favorite bar food place for me.  Loved their clam chowder which is different from the usual gloppy paste served by most restaurants. Went in the other day and was told that they rarely have the chowder anymore. I ordered a tossed salad that was clearly poured from a bag with some pickled jar vegetables thrown in. Dreadful. Had a bowl of chili and arguably the worst excuse for chili ever. It was essentially pulled pork in a bowl with a bit of broth to wet it up a bit. Had it been served between slices of bread, it might have been ok, but as chili...dreadful. I'll go back, but maybe just for beers."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just wanna have some cocktails and play the jukebox.. so many establishments have rules with their jukebox because of sporting events ( I dont mean pens or steelers)   plenty of seating and always a good time at perrytown.."}
{"text":"Great food and very decent service.  Have been going to this place for the last 2 years and have never left disappointed in anything I ordered or timeliness that my food arrived."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out from here several times and have been extremely pleased every time. They make a killer Ruben and an even better fish sandwich. On the side of the building there is a sign advertising a $1 fish sandwich. I asked them about this and much to my dismay they said that it was nothing more than a piece of nostalgia. Both sandwiches are huge and come accompanied by fries for around $8-10.  I've come here to drink a handful of times and have always been pleased with the service. They have a long bar that greats you as you enter and a dining room off to the right which holds around 40-50 people. There are about 15-20 taps many of which advertised micro's. The only knock on this place is that allow smoking on the bar side, however with no real divider to prevent the smoke from wafting through the entire building the whole place smells like cigarettes They do have a deal on Monday's and Wednesdays, 10 free wings with the purchase of a drink from 8-10. The catch is that you have to tolerate the incredibly loud DJ they bring in.   Give it a try, it's certainly one of the better options in West View."}
{"text":"I came out here with about 10 other people in between viewings at the funeral home just down the way. They were immediately able to seat us, and were very appreciative that we helped them move the tables and chairs. The waitress was super nice, and had some good recommendations on the menu items. We ended up getting wings and fries, which were alright. Others in our party got salads and sandwiches - and their sandwiches are MASSIVE. You definitely get a very nice portion for the low price they have. Some of us were wishing we knew their sandwiches were that big - we would have shared them! If you get one of their sandwiches just for you, plan on taking at least half of it home. They have an area away from everyone else where you can go to smoke, but those in the smoking area are definitely apart from the rest, and it was a little difficult to get their attention when food came. I would definitely love to return - just under happier circumstances!"}
{"text":"I have tried to call in orders to this place on multiple occassions to get take out, however, I have never gotten an answer and always gone to their voicemail. Their food looks very good, but since no one will pick up the phone for me, I am taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food is a average, but the service stinks.  Drink specials are good and I've probably been there 6 or so times.  I would go again, but only if someone wanted to meet me there.  One time we went there for the wing special.  The special was capped at 10 wings per person.  We wanted to pay together as a couple, but according to the server we had to pay seperatley to each qualify for the wing special.  After this discussion and agreeing to pay seperate we talked to the manager and this was just how the cash register was set up.  This was wierd and I hope they fixed it, becuase if not for this frustrating experience(which we only found out about when we got the check and were surprised at the size of the bill) I would probably give a better rating."}
{"text":"Food was decent but the bar is smoky and can be smelled In the eating area.  This place is a disgusting dive . Low class"}
{"text":"This place could actually be so great if management and the owner knew anything about the hospitality industry. The things that happens here regularly wrong signs, wrong special cards, and prices went up so much without a warning just wait until you get the tab. The prices increased we were never told that they raised we WERE regulars here so they knew we were familiar with what our tab was going to be by the end of the night. Things are already down hill at the bar and the recent adjustments that have been made there lost my business.    How much of an inconvenience is it to tell your steady crowd prices went up? Our whole friend group comes here because we know it's somewhere to drink they have djs on the weekend and it's not a packed place. After last night it's safe to say there is going to be a new location where we can all meet up. This place continues to rip people off, false advertise, increase prices and there is never any repercussions to their actions we are through with and everyone has had enough.     Learn how to treat people who pay your electric bill. Until further changes are made with the way this place is ran we will not be back this place needs to do a 180 if you want to even make a profit for upcoming months."}
{"text":"This bar/restaurant is located in a very cute, small town Main Street USA setting.   This is my fifth visit. Here are my thoughts:  They have a reasonably-priced wing night, but the wings are just OK at best.  The customers are generally 20-something's, loud but having a great time. It's a bar, right? That's why they come out.  One side of the bar has larger televisions than the other. Guess which side is impossible to secure a seat?  The beer has ALWAYS - WITHOUT EXCEPTION - been sour, flat, not good. And it is not cheap - a pint of Labatt will cost you $5.  The beer is never real cold, and I suspect the lines haven't been cleaned since Bush - H.W, not Dubya - occupied the White House.  This place needs to attend to details to make for a better worthwhile experience."}
{"text":"The bartenders are the most incompetent group of people I have ever had to deal with. It is apparent they ignore their customers unless they're regulars. That is no way to run a business. The woman behind the bar [who had her back turned to me while sitting down] refused to get up and get my tab because her \"feet were cramping\". The main reason I don't think I will be coming back to this bar is the woman who wouldn't get up seemed like the manager on duty. She also had a terrible attitude and ignored me when I attempted to order drinks.  Please learn to clean your bar and keep your bathrooms stalked, especially when there are no more than five customers at your bar. Great job."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here last night for dinner with my girlfriend.  We were late getting home from the city and so wanted a place to eat that was closer to home and this place fit that perfectly.  I have also been coming here since I was a child and have always found the place to be decent.  However, I was sad to see that they had removed all of the sports memorabilia that used to be hanging on the walls of the dining room.  While it now looks cleaner, due to the size of the wall it also looks sort of blank.  For my entree I decided to have the fish sandwich with french fries that is proclaimed in the menu as the North Hills #1 fish sandwich.  This proclamation has been made for as long as I can remember and while I did not believe it with the previous sandwiches that I have had there, I could this time.  The fish came out hot and beer battered on buttered and toasted sandwich bread.  It's batter was nice and crispy and had a slight taste of beer while the fish was flaky, all of which I enjoyed.  The fries were hot whenever they came out as well with some seasoning of salt and pepper which helped to give them a good taste.  My girlfriend also enjoyed the wrap and fries that she ordered.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here in the future.  The food was better than I remembered and it is actually pretty good for being bar food."}
{"text":"Although we come by this place often we never stopped in until we saw a pork smoker outside & thought we would investigate. Went inside & was warmly welcomed ask if they had pulled pork sandwiches & of course they did ordered pulled pork & homemade chips & was promptly served!! What a great surprise the pulled pork was tender in a sauce of a subtle taste of cinnamon & a smokey flavor top with a side order of house made crispy potato chips to die for!! We were well satisfied & cannot wait to come back & try the fish & chips & of course Crab cakes!"}
{"text":"Felt bad for the server. She was running her ass off.  Just amazed that other employees ran orders out but didn't make eye contact, offer to refill drinks , wipe off tables  Yeah, I don't think we'll be back"}
{"text":"Take it go and save yourself a headache.  Alright so my wife and I wanted wings and this place is nearby had good reviews, so we called our order in and went to Shop'N Save to pick up good Bleu Cheese dip and some fresh celery.  (Already had plenty of beer).  They had said 15 minutes on the phone, so I got there after 20 minutes.  The bartender said they weren't done yet and it should just be a minute or two.  After 5 minutes I began to get restless, and assumed they'd offer me a beer since I was waiting.  No such luck and I wasn't going to reward them for being slow.  So I sat there longer, 10 minutes went by and I questioned them.  Voila!  Wings.   The wings were almost top notch.  The teriyaki may have been the best I've had to date, but the hot and bbq were just good, not great.  They kept their crisp while being slathered in good sauce.  They were big, meaty, and fresh tasting. This is their saving grace because the service.....LAME. So because of our decent experience we figured we'd take some friends over there for some drinks after an RMU hockey game.  Worst. Idea. Ever.  The place had some two-bit chump playing the loudest club music outside of Station Square, the place was near empty yet the bartenders took forever to serve you.  The place is nice looking, it has good drafts, and good food, but it really strikes out in the service aspect.  Won't be going back.  PROS - Nice draft list - Good Wings  CONS - Awful service - VERY loud after 8pm - Expensive beer"}
{"text":"Ugh....waitress tried desperately but it was bad!  Food below average, wait was very long with only 3 tables when we arrived. They need a lot of help"}
{"text":"Dirty, smokey, unused kitchen equipment in dining room, hot, uncomfortable, frozen chicken fingers, fries tasted old, burger oblong shape, horrible presentation. Sorry- used to come here in the 90s and even back to the 80s when it was just a bar. Needs some real work seeing what a great location it is. Heard that the BBQ is good when they do it but if so I would get take out."}
{"text":"Slow, incompetent service in the dining room adjacent to the bar. Took forever to get waited on, another forever for the food to arrive. Portions were large, but food was unappetizing. Overcooked limp french fries. Turkey sandwich had sat in the kitchen too long. Pulled pork was decent, but with too little sauce. There were two of us, and it seemed like larger parties got preferred service."}
