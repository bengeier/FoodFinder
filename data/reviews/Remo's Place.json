{"text":"Friend of mine introduced me to this place several months ago. This place is a winner. Go hungry you'll need the room. Easy going atmosphere, good service but don't expect ambience. Come for the food and the friendly service."}
{"text":"Friendly service , great food .
I highly recommend it for someone who likes big portions"}
{"text":"Came for take-out. Food was great everyone was impressed. We got chicken Parmesan, gnocchi, fettuccine alfredo, brushetta. We did have to wait long for the food and the service was good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Remo's Place is where my co-worker always goes for Friday's lunch.

Beware! Portions are huge! :-D
the first time I was there, ordered the lasagna and salad.
Salad came first, size was as if I ordered a full size salad and not something as a side.

then came the lasagna.
I'm sure it weights at least 1.5 lb., they all laugh at me and think that I can't finish it.
I stuffed it all into my belly, end up feeling so sleepy...

Lemon Chicken is a special, should always call ahead to confirm if they have it.

Soup changes daily, and they are all good.

they make pizza too, from the looks of it, it's the thin crust kind and looks really good.
(I always goes for the Soup then Main with Salad)

sitting is a bit limited, (but we always have our table) and parking is limited too, but alot of people do takeout and you can always park on the street.

Service is great, they treat you like family, the chef would greet everyone, and the servers are attentive."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and decided to give it try as I was staying near by. It's nothing fancy as someone stated but the food was great with a good size portion. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great little gem. Seem's like a mom and pop shop so it's very welcoming. 

The food portions are great for the price so if you're looking to a split meal, this is the place to go.

I ordered a Penne Veal dinner. Enough for two since it was a whole plate for the pasta and another plate for the veal plus bread. All this for under 18$ 

Great spot, would recommend and I will be returning"}
{"text":"Not bad, authentic Italian food in the middle of an industrial area. More of a local bar setting than an Italian restaurant though. Not bad value, but the hype about portion size is overblown.  Portion size is what you'd expect for the price. 

The pasta was watery, the veal was bland. The meat sauce was very good as was the meatball sandwich. Perhaps the best independent Italian restaurant in the area but with Woodbridge close by there's are several other choices."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved to the area, and stumbled upon this place. Outside looked like an authentic pizza and pasta place. Great old school atmosphere with super excellent service. Thin crust pizza was unbelievable, fresh ingredients, quality cheese, cooked to perfection just right. Owner was super nice and appreciative. Highly recommend this place to anyone  that loves and wants quality service with great tasting food. Affordable.  We will definitely be back to try the pasta for sure. Quick with your order,  warm old school service. Highly  suggest this place for  dine in or take out."}
{"text":"The food was good. The ceasar salad was wet so the sauce fell of it. Also, there is very little bacon in the salad. But the lasagna made up for the starter. The lasagna was great loved the tomato sauce could do with more beef but overall it was good."}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service.
Very good value and large delicious portions with the freshest ingredients.
Best veal parm. in the GTA."}
