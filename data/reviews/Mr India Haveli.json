{"text":"The best thing about this place is the price. 
Good quality needs improvement to be honest. 
The location is a plus. 
Not a good place to sit and have food as essentially you are in a grocery store. 
Acceptable if not great. They have the advantage of the fact that they are the only 'Indian grocery' store in the complex. 
The quantities were also uneven. One day I got less than average. The other day more than what I expected. 
It lacks a certain consistency. 
Also restocking is a problem. They have a little buffet of sorts in the front and I've seen some of the dishes almost empty. Professionally they need to be topped up. 
However, that day they didn't top up the food because 'the time was short and it wouldn't be beneficial', which was a weird thing considering the store closes at 9 pm and it was only 7 pm when I went."}
{"text":"There food is okay. I prefer not eating there for main courses. However, their samosas and chaats are worth trying."}
{"text":"The worst place to get food. The service was sooooo slow. We spent 35min waiting for food from a hot table .
They forgot half of the order had to go back and get the rest. They only said sorry.
I told them that now my food was cold and they did not care . 
Not sure why anyone would go to this place. The food was tasty and good. The the service was bad."}
{"text":"3.5 solid! This is an updated review. I've noticed that the kitchen and front staff have changed. I'm wondering if the management has changed as well. Although they're a bit slow with service, their demeanor is kinder than before. 

This place is not only a restaurant but a big Indian food store! If you're ever out of ideas for lunch or dinner, I suggest you try their 5.99 Biryani. The flavours of the spices are great with the accompaniment of their yoghurt and fresh green cilantro/mint sauce. You can't go wrong with the huge quantity for a price like that. 

If your into veggie dishes try their crispy samosas and their chickpea curry with Bhatturas. Bhatturas are like big crispy fried dough but slightly chewy inside very comparable to a beaver tail dough (dessert, not the animal). It's best eaten with a curry.

Don't be intimidated, try something out of your comfort zone."}
{"text":"2.5*, mediocre, edible, inexpensive, looks clean.

I've had 1.5 takeaways from Mr. India Haveli, located inside Mr. India Grocers, a fairly new, Indian grocery store.  Whenever I drive by, the parking lot appears empty, so I have been a bit hesitant to try it out.

Samosas:  Edible, but not great.  Stuffing is uneven, so at some bites, you'll get more crispy wrapping than you will potato/peas/whatnot.  Reasonably priced at $1 for 2 samosas.

Chicken Biryani:  I just finished eating it.  Visually, it was a bit of a soupy mess!  Rice was long-grain, but not as thin as basmati.  Rice was rather wet and overcooked, so they added too much water.  Chicken was moist, boneless, not sure if it was cooked with the rice itself.  Flavours are decent, but again, too mushy/wet!

Fish Pakora:  Not sure if this is what it was called, but it's the shape of a burger patty and has some kinda minced fish.  Tasty, but a bit too salty, and mushy/wet again.

There are daily specials each day.  I believe Tuesdays is Chicken Biryani for $5, usually $5.99.  So unless this was an off-day, you're curious, or really hankering for Indian food, and are in the area, there are better places around!"}
