{"text":"Love love love the pizza here!! The owners are so warm and welcoming as soon as I walked in the door. I ordered the OMG and cheese with both the thick and thin crust, which were both equally tasty. Super fluffy and fresh ingredients. I can't wait to give their pastas a shot. Definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"Coming from being and employee at the best pizzeria in Winnipeg 2012, my standards for pizza are set fairly high. In my search for pizza in Calgary I've become shy of trying new pizzerias being disappointed time and time again by poor quality toppings, oil product cheeses and dough that isn't cooked because the oven is sub par. The first place I had pizza from on 68th was condemned two days later! Gross!
Fast forward to tonight. Was I ever glad when I took my first bite of a pep n mush pizza from Sepassi's. That's the gold standard, pepperoni and mushroom. If they nail the pep and mush they'll surely delight on anything else. If they screw it up it wont be so bad. I tried the deep dish, fully expecting the dough to be half-raw, but much to my delight this was the first pizzeria in Calgary to get it right! Crispy, fluffy and delicious.
The wings were delicious as well with amazing honey garlic sauce! Delicious! Nothing frozen here folks.
The sweet bread... simply delectable. My partner says to me \"What's in this little container?\" It's dipping whipped cream covered in caramel. Genius.
I'm so relieved that there is good pizza in delivery distance.
Thank you!"}

Don't take my word for it though, go see for yourself.  Their customers are often blown away by the quality of food and the taste."}
