{"text":"Horrible service, messed up all our orders. Food was horrible worst hakka place in Brampton."}
{"text":"Newest Chinese food corner in the neighbourhood. Good food and price. Honey garlic chicken is nice."}
{"text":"It was tasteless not really chicken or veggies in the noodles. Garlic chicken was so disappointing didn't really taste like chicken and the souse was so think and sugary 
Don't recommend it at all"}
{"text":"Horrible!! Everything taste the same and leaves your tongue numb. I ordered 2 dishes and they were ready in 5 mins so nothings cooked fresh just reheated"}
{"text":"Everything tastes the same.. And not good. Probably they have pre cooked. There are way better options close by"}
{"text":"The food is not great. I have been there both times for hot and sour soup take out, and the soup is not amazing. But what bugs me is that, both occasions I specifically asked for Hot sauce packages, and both times when coming home there were none. Not even a utensil or anything (which I don't mind if I am eating at home). But the fact that this happened on two different occasions, just shows how little care they put into their customer service. The second time this happened, which was about 30mins ago, I called back just to let them know (not even to complain), and after hearing me explain above, they put me on hold to answer the call of a take out order, and after being on hold for 8 minutes I decided to just write this review instead. I can understand if they are overly busy, but both times the place was pretty empty. Today, there was only one table being served."}
{"text":"The only reason I've gone to this place 2x now is simply because it's super close to home. This place definitely does not satisfy the Hakka craving. Also as mentioned in other reviews it's pretty bland."}
{"text":"One word: Bland! 

Went on a weekday and we were the only occupied table. We had spring rolls, Hakka fried rice, Hakka fried noodles and chilli chicken. While portions were more than healthy, it didn't matter as you probably won't want seconds. Bland, brown and just meh. You can get better food in a mall food court."}
{"text":"I would like to share my experience I went in and ordered chicken on fried rice the kitchen door was left open I saw the \"chef\" right in front of me microwave my chicken, it was disgusting! There are better places around I'm sure that would serve food not microwaved! I was also sick the next day! Avoid at all cost!"}
{"text":"Lack of hygiene!  If you care about your health, stay away from this place. I can't comment on the food since I asked for a refund and walked out after what I saw."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!! We ordered a Hakka dinner for 2 and less than 3 hours later we were all sick with food poisoning. 

Our 20 month old son was so ill and all he ate was the noodles that came with the dinner. 

We have ordered from them maybe 3 other times and never had an issue but we will never be going back again.

Awful costumer service! We called today to tell them what happened and they didn't believe us since they didn't get any other complaints. For a resolution they offered to give us the money for the noodles back. They seriously thought offering less than $10 was acceptable. We demanded back our full money back (Less than $40!) and they refuse."}
{"text":"I am more than disappointed with the food received! I ordered tiger prawns in general tso sauce and what I received was an insult to my love for that dish. There was a putrid smell that was accompanied by a horrible old taste.  I had two bites and told the owner I couldn't even force myself to eat that dish. He acted shocked for half a second while charging me for the dish regardless!  I read (afterwards) from a previous diner that he didn't believe that the food was fresh. I have to agree. Stale, old, possibly reused... Omg... I think I'm going to be sick..."}
{"text":"This place is HALAL. Because it's close to home we decided to order out from here a few dishes that we normally get...fried rice, noodles, chicken (w gravy), and so on, the usual. 

The food is OK. We order without MSG so half the chinese salt flavor is gone from any dish regardless. But still, a lot of other restaurants we've been to have great tasting food. This place on the other hand is OK. The food is a bit bland and the chicken sometimes tastes like it's under-cooked. 

The hot and sour soup is pretty good along with the chicken corn soup. That's all we get from here now...soups."}
{"text":"I have ordered the scheshwan chicken as displayed in the picture menu and was truly disappointed, very bland. No spice, as I wanted to give them a second chance as chilli chicken is bad as well."}
