{"text":"I love the movie theatre and fat burger but in the buffet, they need some work.
Use homemade ranch or don't serve it at all. Bottled ranch in a restaurant is not cool. Also bring back the oyster sauce at the Mongolian bbq section. That's the best one. Other than that the place is pretty clean and food is good."}
{"text":"Paid $136/night for dark, dingy room, old carpet throughout, thread bare linens, a view of a cement wall, no air exchange in the bathrooms ICK. A/C unit worked, thank goodness. Air exchange on casino floor is either sub par or overwhelmed be the number smokers. Food Court was good for our group of teenagers. Property looks like it needs updating in general. Not one complaint about the staff but there are definitely deferred maintenance issues at this property."}
{"text":"My family were in Las Vegas and we stayed in Fiesta Henderson last May 31.this is our second stay in this hotel. we like to stay here because it always offers the lowest rate for our family like us who is always on budget and have simple needs. the first stay three years ago was ok. but the second stay was a rather gross disappointment because of the housekeeping. the toilet bowl wasn't scrubbed.Now, i know toilet when it is not done, this is my favorite spot to clean. when we came from strolling the strip of las vegas.so now that i saw that, it made me question of the rest of the sanitation in the other areas like towels and bed sheets. it wasn't like this the first time. i hope they pay more attention to this. such a waste if they woulsdl ose clients this way. the front desk though was excellent. no pretense. just downright warmth and calm."}
{"text":"I stayed here but was disappointed as its Air Conditioner does not work properly. Once you sleep the AC also sleeps.

Once you set a room temperature and that temperature is reached the AC shuts down and never starts even if the temperature is more than what's in the thermostat. You need to constantly moving so that the AC is On. The hair dryer was not functioning and find hair inside it.
You need to wait 10 minutes or so to get connected to the front desk."}
{"text":"Went here with some fiends we were desperate looking for a place to stay and decided to go here.  Wasn't bad but the security ket harrassing me the whole time which was a really big turn off.  Never been harrassed by a security guard in my entire life and I have been to every hotel in Vegas.  This white dork with glasses was just really bored and had drank way to much coffee or taken too much speed and would not leave us alone.  I fianlly had to complain to the front desk.  The guy even asked me what room i was staying in.  First he goes you can't walk around with your shirt un buttoned then we went to the pool at like 8pm and hes like the pools closed get out now and was totall dick about it, then he tried to follow us to our rooms, CREEEEPO!!!! dont go ehre the security is on tweek or something complete freaks sorry fiesta but you suuuuck!"}
{"text":"i am only reviewing the buffet. Mostly because i do not frequent buffets, and in the past when i have i was fairly disgusted. HOWEVER, this was amaaaazing enough to go back to a couple days later. for 6.99 dinner buffet i couldnt stay there long enough. Everything was amazing, including the made to order mongolian section."}
{"text":"Terrible place to book a stay!! My fianc√© and I got a room for the weekend. We both woke up with rashes from the linen and the room was extremely stuffy!! Never again will We be staying there. Try Eastside Cannery or Boulder Station nicer and cleaner rooms."}
{"text":"Stay the hell away from the buffet, unless you enjoy eating with other people animals, I sat  down to eat my lunch and low and behold people eating at the buffet is taking there animals up to the buffet as the animals are stiffing all over the food. I ask for the Manager who seem to be not surprise by this as she told me it not just for service animals but your companion( dogs, snakes, rabbits, cats, birds) as well. They are a pet friendly hotel and you are also allowed to have your animal gamble right next to you well playing slot machines. I gamble in this casino at least three times a week and this is my first time ever seeing animals in the casino next to their owners unleashed. This casino have lost my
Business (10k) a year. I rather play in a casino and eat in a casino where I don't have to have worry about tics and fleas jumping all over the place."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a non-glitzy casino to hang out at, this is just the place. I've spent countless hours at this establishment to kill time. I had pretty good luck on the Wheel of Fortune machines. I went here for the Bingo games. It's smaller than some other casinos, so it can get stuffy. Free donuts if you go to the earlier games. :) I stayed at the hotel once, and I wouldn't ever go back. I probably paid less than $50 for the room, and it became pretty obvious why it was so cheap. I have a pretty sensitive nose, and one night was enough to deter me from staying there the second night. Nonetheless, it's a fun, quiet casino to gamble your money away. Shoot, you can even show up in your pajamas and no one would bat an eyelash."}
{"text":"If you are going here for anything other than the movie theater or Fatburger, don't expect much. Nkw in the other hand if you are from out of town and on a budget, this could be your hotel. 

This is and always will be labeled a locals casino. However, a coworker of mine recently stayed here with no rental car and it worked out great. It was cheap and he didn't need to leave to go find something to eat. Everything he needed was right there....except something that I feel is a big deal. There is no laundry room available. Not even a service they offer. So if you are staying here exclusively, please keep that in mind."}
{"text":"The worse stay ever. I don't even write reviews but this called for one. First, they only activated one of my keys so without knowing I used the activated key first then the next morning when I used the other key I was locked out. Called downstairs, man put me on hold for so long I leave my bags in front my room and go down there to discover him doing nothing and no one in line. Thats the first incident. I also had a constant leak in the shower so the tub kept filling up. Second, my friend went back to the hotel for my retainer that was left. They then told him that it was thrown away. Terrible.  Last, they refunded $77 dollars as my deposit. Then 3 days later took the money back to reprocess the refund and without me knowing I had to call my bank and they said my refund would be coming back within a few MORE days and told me to call the hotel and see why the put my refund back and then took it back. In short, again. It was bad. I wouldn't do it again if I was paid to. Green Valley Ranch will now be taking my money."}
{"text":"I came to stay at the Fiesta Henderson on short notice. I picked it because I has stayed at Boulder Station and it was nice. Fiesta Henderson (a Station Hotel) was not so nice. The nicest part of the hotel is the rooms. They looked nice and were pretty comfortable, if you don't mind dust that it. There was dust on the lampshade, mirrors, tv, etc. I thank Hotel Impossible for teaching me what to look for. Next, we had to eat....Man, you wanna try a Vegas area buffet that sucks. Try this one. It was like middle school cafeteria food. Next, we went to the Fiesta Cafe (used to be Dennys), and that food was also bad. The breakfast food was pretty good. Dinner was not, service was also slow, and they hound you to get a players card every time...Clearly maintenence issues all around that as a customer I could see. Positives: wifi was not working and i called down to the front desk and got great assistance right away.  Pool was nice. Overall, if I had to I would stay there again. Its not baaaad (except for the food), but it wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"We didn't enjoy our stay at the Fiesta very much.  Expedia had a special of some sort for them -- and then delisted them immediately, so I can't even post a review on the site that sold us the \"discounted room\".  We had been hoping for an airport hotel; in fact the Fiesta is a solid 30 minutes on the highway from the LV airport.  It has a dingy, seedy feeling -- the gaming rooms seem popular and crowded, but there are no reasonable restaurants (e.g. you can get a burger or pizza but nothing \"fancy\"), and the room was damp, smelled of tobacco despite being a non-smoking room, and had lumpy, soft mattresses that made you sort of shudder thinking of hygiene.  The swimming pool looked nice but my wife and sister in law said that it reeked of chlorine to a point that they didn't want to stay in it for long.

So all in all, I recommend giving this one a pass.  It badly needs a significant renovation.

PS: I'm not a gamer so ignore this review if you are coming to play the slots or something.  If anything, that side of the place looked very popular."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it 0 stars too!!! Warning if you eat at buffet....bakery guy in plain site has a weird obsession with licking his fingers and touching every plate he serves!!! He is the only one we seen without gloves on. We couldn't believe our eyes.  Watching him in disbelief he licked his fingers time and time again and poked deserts! Absolutely disgusting!!! 

And the room to top it all of after a nice hot shower was to pull down the sheets and find bed bugs. Immediately called front desk and she said that it's probably just fruit flies! Are you kidding me? I don't think so!!! They put us in an off room suite with a cardboard feeling bed for our \"inconvenience of bed bugs\". Will never stay here again!!!"}
{"text":"Good as a hotel; casino filled with old, sad people.

The Fiesta is a fairly tired casino that appears to attract an ageing and/or lower income clientele. Nothing wrong with that at all, but it's something of which to be aware. I chose to stay a week in their hotel because the rates are very good: this week I paid  average $38 per night, plus a $10 per day resort fee for a total of $48 per night. The fee includes WiFi, and I'm sure some other amenities but I don't plan to go and find them because they're sure to be just ok. There is no workout facility.

It seems that room rates fluctuate wildly and daily, so it's important to check daily for the best deal. For example, 3 weeks out from now the rates average $69/day but 2 weeks out average $29/day (both excluding resort fee).

My room is plenty adequate: the bed is comfy and the room large but sparse. Better than average quality hotel furniture but dated (but not badly so). The bathroom is workable; it appears to share the same ventilation system as the casino because I can smell the cigarette smoke lightly drifting in. It's not terrible but if you're sensitive to smoke then be aware of it.

I will come back for another work trip soon because it's cheap and comfortable. The casino itself is sorry and smokey so I'm definitely not going to indulge there."}
{"text":"My first yelp review! Worst  checking in my 30 years of travel. One front desk person and she spent 45 minutes with one person that was checking in a 30 person group! Tried to get her to call for help or just checkin 10 from group then take a person from the line ( only 2 people in line) - but she waited until the full group was taking care of before handling anyone else .  And this group was making deposit in CASH!

No common sense here.

Only good news is after 30 minute wait had plenty of time to write this review.

I will post after I get my room.

Of course reserved king got 2 queen with a/c that could only cool to about 76.

Never again."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I started dating on Christmas of 2012...one of the places he wanted to take my kids and I was too the festival buffet. I remember the first time we went....it was pretty good. I ate till I nearly popped and the kids enjoyed it. we go back a lot but every time it gets worse and worse and my stomach just cant handle it.

They seem to be changing a lot of the menu items and it gets skimpier and skimpier. The staff is okay....some of them will check up on you a lot and some just pass you by as if your just another number floating in the breeze. My boyfriend actually complained to the manager about it once because our waiter was refilling everyone's drink but ours.  I have no clue why we go back, I guess its more for the kids sake because we no longer enjoy it much. The foods quality and preparation has gone from maybe around  an 8 to about a 3. I don't recommend going unless you have a 2 for 1 and your desperate for food.

If it were not for it being a quick cheap dinner for the kids I would never go back. Just in a year the food and service has gone down hill."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!HORRIBLE!!!HORRIBLE!!! Customer Service....This casino is very unprofessional, I was playing the roulette wheel and won ($560.00) so I asked the dealer \"Gasper\" when he gave me my chips \"how much did I win\"? No answer. I proceeded to ask again but this time infront of His supervisor\" Hector\" Who also says to me \" You don't  know how to count\" Excuse me I replied, he continues by telling me \"honey this isn't Rancho, this is Henderson.\" I don't know what the supervisor meant by that comment but yes I was stun to hear that and especially from a supervisor. To my friends and family all I can say don't give this casino your business...to everyone else I say the same."}
{"text":"Don't stay here! The rooms are dirty and smelly. I found a shoe, plastic Baggie, white powdery stuff, a squished bug behind the headboard, and if that isn't enough....a condom wrapper on the floor."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was terrible. The bacon was the limpest and greasiest I've ever had. By contrast the sausage links were crusty-overlooked. The scrambled eggs were rubbery dry. 
Coupled with the length of wait time for the cashier to leisurely process customers things did not improve once seated. Our wait person could not be found for initial drink requests. We finally gave up and went for the food only to return to our table and wait 5 more minutes for service. 

The crowning disparaging point is Fiesta has removed all fresh fruit from their menu. This is unbelievable for such a venue. 

I suggest passing on their brunch until they feel customer service pinch enough to improve poor quality and service."}
{"text":"*** LOOK OUT FOR RIPOFF PRICING ***

I booked this hotel on Expedia for about $22 a night, mid week rates.  When I got here the hotel wants to charge an extra (approx) $12 a day for \"resort fee for wifi, etc\" and it was mandatory.  There's no way around it.  So basically the $22 price is a lie when it's really about $35 a night.

See other reviews.  Many others complain about the same resort fee.

I would be fine with this basic, old casino hotel paying $35 a night without the trickery - it's clean enough, and it's old, and the casino is smoky - it's much nicer than a crappy Motel 6 in any little town by the interstates.  But I'm putting down only 1 star for the pricing issue above.

Buyer be aware!"}
{"text":"I never actually stayed here (room).  The review is of their buffet.  I simply loved it.  It was cheap, the food was good and there was plenty of it.  Feeling a little mexican food they got it, American yup, Asian, yup seafood, salad, desert all covered.  The best for me was making my tacos and then doing the mashed potato with chicken thing.  Then when I know my family is still going to sit around and talk, I hit the Crawfish.  This place got me hooked on Crawfish.  I had bout two or three plates full of these cajun wonders.  Good food, good price.  four stars"}
{"text":"Worst hotel experience ever.  Day 1,I checked in and asked the girl at the front desk where would be a good place to go dancing.  She said, \"I don't know.  We don't have that here.\" When I got to my room I called down to the front desk, \" can I have a lightbulb it's dark in here and the lights don't work?  Oh no, I'm late!  No, the time on the clock is 45 minutes fast I guess I'll set it myself.. at least the numbers on the clock were dimmly lighting the room.  Day 2,  can I please have batteries for the remote?  Day 3, I used the 2 oz of shampoo you provided on day 1 and 2,  Is it too much to ask to get another 2 oz  since I'm staying 5 days?   Oh, and the 2 plastic drinking cups have been used and thrown away.  Can I have a cup so I don't have to suck water from the sink?  Day 4, no hot water which means no shower and no food because the restaurants can't open without hot water.  I skipped day 5 and stayed with a friend.  Maybe they should advertise as a camping casino.  Bring your own everything."}
{"text":"Bleh!!!!!!  The casino is fine.  The ROOM was a complete disappointment.  To start, the up/down button on the wall to get the elevator was punched in (the whole wall plate).  Our room stunk like dirty feet.  The room was SPARSELY decorated. Cheap, cheap, CHEAP!  While in the shower, the tub didn't drain and the surrounding wall was peeling and gross!  While brushing my teeth, the sink didn't drain.  Definitely WOULD NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"I booked my room soley on the basis of location.  I was a little nervous after checking out the reviews here, but was pleasantly pleased with how my trip turned out.  Every employee I came in contact with was friendly and helpful.  The room was very basic, but was clean and quiet.  I only ate breakfast here, and the food is nothing fancy, but for $4 you can find something that satisfies.  I just needed a place to sleep that was clean and quiet and the Fiesta met my needs."}
{"text":"It's just all around bad.  We've stayed here a few times but it is just progressively getting worse and worse.  The air doesn't work, it's beyond dirty and trying to take a shower is a joke. I will NEVER stay here again."}
{"text":"Have stayed here a few times!  The rooms are good and were clean!  Yes its not done out like a strip hotel/casino but if that's what you want go stay on the strip.  I have had no problems here and enjoyed my stay and have eaten at several of the restaurants and again no problems with the food or the service from the staff!

Easy access from the freeway and not far from the water street district!

I would stay again no problem!  And I don't gamble so what the casino is like downstairs does not really affect my stay!"}
{"text":"I checked in here because I got a good room rate. Save yourself the trouble, they advertise free wifi. You actually get basic wifi that is very poor and have to pay $7.99 more a day for wifi that will allow you a half decent connection. Then when you get to your room if you choose the basic (which is pretty much useless) you are stuck with it for 24 hrs before you can pay to upgrade it. Help from front desk was confusing and resulted in not be able to upgrade the wifi."}
{"text":"So I watched a movie then decided to play $60 at some slots & keno. Well didn't work out at all. I've lost before no big deal, but I've never felt cheated like I do after I tried playing here. I've done better on the strip. It's too bad I kinda liked this place."}
{"text":"Ahh. The Fiesta Henderson poker room. It's the closest poker room from the crib. If you like playing no limit poker, then this card room is defiantly not for you. If you like playing against locals that talk all that jazz about how good their odds are for making the call(keep in mind that that they only play 2-4 limit), then come on down! And if you want to blend in with the locals, be sure to wear your shades, your poker hat that you bought with all of your Stations player points and your 3rd generation iPod that has only 7 songs on it. Don't get me started on the players that stiff the dealer. Meet me there, I'll be the guy wearing the \"I got the nuts!\" t-shirt."}
{"text":"The late night menu at cafe fiesta is decent and priced well. Pancakes though are some of the best I have had! My 5 year old loves the buffet."}
{"text":"So I dragged my partner to bingo at the Fiesta Henderson last night and pay back was going for Mexican food. I did not want to go to amigos as the previous times we had been there the service and food were really poor. I was pleasantly surprised, the menu has changed and has many great additions and the service has improved greatly. I am pleased to say this is back on the list of my local hangouts. The Carnitas were delicious."}
{"text":"We stayed here last minute after a bad experience off the LV Strip left us stranded and needing a place to stay. I had stayed here before, but had forgotten until we pulled in. Clean room and friendly staff. The heater worked a little too well and the bed could have been a little softer. But it was great for the money! I'd definitely stay here again!"}
{"text":"They get one star because the AC in the room works and the valet was nice.

The hotel is outdated. Beds are terribly uncomfortable and mattresses are well past their prime.  Carpet is torn and stained.

The worst part is the front desk staff. First, you chose customer service, so if you hate people,  you should rethink that.  My reservation for a king bed meant nothing. Then they charge a deposit on top of having paid for the room in advance. And, they charge a daily resort fee.  Between the rude staff and the nickel and dime charges, I won't be back, and I won't spend a penny in their casino. I'd rather drive to the Strip to play then give these schlubs any more money.

Very. Very. Very. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Stay away from hotel, yikes! boy did I get what i payed for got even less, first Dirty, Dusty, old. could not breath clearly, air conditioner coils and vent had not been cleaned for years, i could swipe my finger on any piece of furniture and yikes,,,dust everywhere, carpet is stained, and to boot we did not travel with pets and they stuck us in a pet staying room, our next door guests had pets and we could hear them barking, and we could see where a dog( s)were scratched up  the door, would have left but no cancelling possible and this was our first time to Las Vegas, we decided to   stay and visited the strip and hoover dam, that was the fun part!  I left a nice note for maid to clean but NO go came back from the strip still dirty, the just made the bed and left clean towels and left, while on line searching the pictures were photo shopped to look nicer!  and as checking out gal at registration desk just printed our receipt and did not even ask how our stay was, mmm wonder why? STAY AT YOUR OWN RISK! 
NEVER AGAIN FOR ME!"}
{"text":"Once I was brought to my table, I sat for a couple minutes to order my drink before I started the smorgasbord. Nothing. So, I went to fill up my plate. I returned to the table with a hot plate, and wait again for a server. Meanwhile, food is cooling down. To avoid neglecting myself from a hot meal, I began to eat. But wait, I need tabasco. Apparently, the lady seated behind me needed service also, but she decided to walk up to a service station and get her own tabasco sauce. It wasn't until I went to do the same when the server finally came to ask if I wanted a drink. The elderly couple tried to flag down that server 2 times before they were able to get service as well. So, minus 2 stars for bad service.
Cheese tortellini was awful. The orange chicken was mostly just orange tempura batter. The only things that had any flavor was the breakfast sausage links, corned beef hash, and the sugar cone that holstered my yogurt, all of which takes minimal attention from anyone. Minus one more star. The fact that they didn't burn the precooked hash, or undercook the links, or put out crushed cones was why they gotten any stars at all.
Pay attention people- if you were running an airport, nevermind. Bad example. That's it. Bad example for a buffet."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the service at this buffet and the food and staff were amazing!! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to eat and have some fun gambling!!!"}

{"text":"On my 80th birthday I went to the Fiesta Buffett for a Corned Beef dinner. NO boiled potatoes, NO Carrots, there was Cabbage, but it wasn't cooked and only barely warm. The Corned Beef was inedible full of gristle and fat. I never did eat an actual piece of meat."}
{"text":"I can't understand why anyone would not give the Fiesta a 5 star rating.  This was one of the nicest (not fancy) hotel/casinos we have stayed at.  The room was spotless and the mattress was the most comfortable I have slept on in any hotel.  The front desk employees were very polite and accommadating.  The casino is nicely laid out too.  The food was excellent in the buffet.  I definitely want to go back.  Thank you Fiesta!"}
{"text":"We stayed here just to sleep while passing through on our vacation. The room was an unbeatable price ($29) and the room was extremely clean and comfy. Our tv and wifi worked great and we ordered pizza to our room with ease. Seriously cannot beat the price, especially for how good of condition our room was. If we are ever passing by again we will stay here!"}
{"text":"The hotel staff seemed rushed and didn't explain anything that they were just swiping my card for. When I got to my room it smelled awful and the sheets and pillow case had blood on them. Yes blood!! When I called the front desk the only thing they said was that they'd call housekeeping. They sent a woman who was very nice who replaced the sheets and pillow cases. The walls were so thin all I could hear was my extremely sick neighbor coughing and sneezing alllll night. Terrible hotel. Will not be staying here again"}
{"text":"I am in the Las Vegas area twice a month for family and other pleasures. I usually stay at the Aliante when in North Las Vegas, or a Marriott property when elsewhere. This time, I gambled and tried this Station casino property. Mistake.
It has seen better times and, unfortunately, management sees no real need to advance it into 2015. The rooms were staid, the beds barren (no spreads, extra pillows, or comforters). 
It's worth noting that the upscale Aliante was once a Station property. The Aliante has done much better since leaving that fold. Kudos to them.
I noticed people walking non-service dogs into the Fiesta's casino; I didn't inquire as to whether the hotel is pet friendly, but that's a no-no for me. There are some spaces I don't care to share. 
The front desk staff was trained, but mechanical. I paid my security deposit in cash, so as not to have my credit card encumbered for up to ten business days. When I got home, I found that they charged the deposit to my credit card anyway. That means they held two security deposits simultaneously. Egads.
I won't return. Better to pay a few dollars more elsewhere and get the better experience. 
The good: The price. The Regal Theatre. 
The bad: Everything else."}
{"text":"After a long day driving in the wrong direction and a longer day driving to our final destination, I can say I was not planning on much from the $20.86 room awaiting me at the Fiesta Henderson Hotel & Casino, however I was mistaken. This is by no means a luxury hotel, but for the price, it was fantastic. This was a room well worth $60-70, with plenty of amenities and the staff was really nice. There was a $10 \"resort fee\" when we got there, but racked it up to what we would pay for wifi anywhere else. All in all, we spent about $30 and were thrilled, and stayed several hours later than we expected. If you are expecting a clean hotel, friendly staff, and no bells or whistles, the Fiesta is for you."}
{"text":"Royal flush ur money down the toilet capital of the world!! Worst place to gamble! If I thought it would do any good I'd call the gaming control commission on there machines, but I know how the industry works and I know that's a waste of time! Being in the industry I can guarantee u that this place is not on the up and up! Gambler beware of this dump"}
{"text":"I have gambled there few times , but mostly we go there for the buffet , two for one with the coupon they send out. This is very cheap buffet but food is not that bad at all. Clean and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Fiesta is a Mexican latin themed hotel .property & they discontinued their Mexican restaurant.  WHAT!!!  I repeat WHAT!!!  Makes no sense. Very Dumb management decision.  And at the buffet, the food station for Mexico they have a huge sign labeling the food as Mexicano.  Probably because it rhymes with \"Chicano\" that shows how the Fiesta and Station Casino management are all out of touch.  When the property was \"The Reserve\" it had a bit more class and seemed more in touch with their resort theme,  Now not so with this Fiesta Stations casino property."}
{"text":"We made a reservation through American Express with a confirmation for a king bedded room.  When we arrived we were advised they had none left but we were\"upgraded\" to a room with a Murphy bed pullout. When we arrived it was clear that we received the living room section of a suite with a very small Murphy bed big enough for one. They refused to walk us to another hotel which is the standard practice when a hotel is sold out and the room type which was confirmed is unavailable. The room was dusty and filthy. The Murphy bed was broken as several of the wood slats that hold up the \"mattress\" were broken and missing. I tried to make another reservation elsewhere but it was a citywide sellout due to a nascar race. The next morning at 9a I asked for the manager on duty and as advised there was none available. I left my business card with the front desk and asked for a call from the GM but a week later have not received one. This place is a dump and their cleanliness is non existent as you can see from my pictures.    


Update 
I disputed the charges with Amex as I booked through their website. I won, they lost. I ended up paying zero for this day which is still too much given the disgusting room. Shame on you fiesta for not acting in a professional manner upon not providing the guaranteed room type for your customers, we should have been walked to another hotel!"}
{"text":"The overall stay at the Fiesta was not that bad besides the fact that my bed sheets and blanket completely smelt like mildew that it was lingering on my clothes even after I got up from the bed. we had to call housekeeping to ask for new ones because they smelt THAT bad. Completely disgusting. that and also the line to check out was ridiculous. it was 20 mins before check out time and there was only one person at the desk working with a huge line. I won't be staying here again just based on those things. there is no excuse for either of those."}
{"text":"The staff was great the food was excellent. The rooms were good but our door didnt close unless we slammed it otherwise it was great!"}
{"text":"angry dealers, nasty tables, not worth the gas even when you live around the corner"}
{"text":"I suppose for $54.99 per night you can't ask for too much, but my wife and I were not too excited about our room or experience.  We needed to find a room in Henderson and did not go to the Fiesta for the casino, in fact we didn't even go to the casino except to pass through it.

Our room was not clean and smelled very bad.  It was a non-smoking room, and it didn't smell like cigarette smoke, it just smelled unclean.  Our bathroom was not that clean and the toilet seat was broken and the toilet itself would lean forward when you sat down on it.  

You have to walk through the casino and cigarette smoke to check into your room and to access the elevators, so you have to drag your luggage through the occupied casino and walk in between gambling to get anywhere.  

The pool was OK, however again, to get to the pool you have to walk through part of the casino which seems like a major design flaw.  Who wants to walk past people gambling in your swimsuit to get outside to the pool?  We would not go back."}
{"text":"BEDBUGS, BEDBUGS, BEDBUGS!!  I came over Mother's Day weekend to spend time with my sister as a last minute trip. Arrived at the hotel after 9pm. Went to the room, dropped our stuff off and headed downstairs. Returned to our room just after 2am. Getting ready for bed and picked up the pillow only to find bedbugs crawling on them. I immediately took pictures of them and then called the front desk. They sent up security to take a report. As the guard was waiting for the head security lady was making a copy of my drivers license he saw the bugs too. They took photos and then transferred us to another room. After that, we couldn't sleep, just completely disgusted. The next morning I went to speak with the manager Patrick Amato. Of course, his shift didn't start till noon. At noon, I went back to the front desk, still no manager. At 12:20, I asked them to call him. I was told he was there, but conveniently \"in meetings\". Finally around 1:30'ish I was able to talk to him. He apologized for the inconvenience, assured me he would contact hotels.com and have my stay refunded. They said they couldn't do anything until after the investigation was completed and they had a positive result of bedbugs. I explained that I had pictures, security had pictures and saw with their own eyes! Outside of transferring me to another room, the customer service from this manager was very poor. I had stayed at this place many times with no issues until this trip. After the bedbugs and being treated so poorly, i highly doubt I will ever return,"}
{"text":"The worst!!! Haven't been there in years and will NOT be back anytime soon. Started playing a slot and the right in the middle of a bonus the entire row of machines short out!!! Richard the slot tech was very nice and worked on the machine for what seemed an eternity. All I wanted to do was have a nice time playing a bit and all that I got to do was sit and watch while they tried to get my money out of the machine."}
{"text":"Terrible. Disrespectful staff and security. I use to go there alot because i live close, playing Blackjack there is miserable because the dealers are so disrespectful and rude. No good live music, the buffet is no good and they're rude. Avoid this place"}
{"text":"Epic fail for Fiesta Henderson. Website says cafe sells Chinese food til 11pm. We order and 2nd server butts in saying it's only until 10pm. Called over mgr who has the exec chef in tow. As long as they have worked there it's only been til 10..show them their own hotel website and they disagree with me. Up we go and go over to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Bad service ran us right out the door in a few quick minutes.  It was Sunday evening at the (Coco Loco)? bar right inside the front door.  Yes, I am pointing fingers at the late-forty-something barman who was so off-putting that we had to halt our Sunday Funday 'Fiesta' and find another place to game.   
He had the complete power to either a: be nice, have fun, and make some $$ off of the 4 of us or b:  be one of those shitty bartenders who is likely burnt out, hates his life, and is happy to make minimal tips.  We all know which one he chose.
We never got to know whether or not we liked the actual casino.  He soured us to the point that we simply carried on elsewhere."}
{"text":"Buffet was okay for this area. At $10.99 for weekend dinner, I can't really complain. 

However, for a three-year-old to cost $9.99? That's a little much."}
{"text":"A shit load of TVs playing all the games and $1 buds and hot dogs during football... SOLD!!!!"}
{"text":"Sucks having to make a one star review. So when I do, I know they deserve it. Being a local, my girlfriend and I go here a lot to drink, eat at the buffet, and gamble. Today, a security guard Brian thought my gf was more than 16 years younger than the legal gambling age, which was a stretch of the imagination. She showed him her  legal and valid international identification card from her country, and then he started with the questions. She answered all his questions, then he asked her to leave the property. She then went to management to discuss first, which no one showed up, so we left. We were loyal local customers who spent money gambling, ate at the buffet, and drank, who are now taking our business somewhere else. In 2 years, every establishment has accepted her valid ID, and we've gambled at Fiesta before with no issues, except for big Brian today. She is almost 40 years old with valid ID, and a loyal customer, who was just driven away at his request. We will not come back, and will take our business elsewhere. When Fiesta gets more complaints on security, you'll see a pattern of terrible customer service. Not worth going here anymore for us. We are given warm welcomes elsewhere."}
{"text":"I come here as much as I do because it's in a great location and offers a little bit of everything.

I remember when the FH was \"The Reserve\" and had an african safari kind of theme to it.  The only real evidence of the TR are the brass monkey heads that line the bar the mexican restaurant.

Customer service is hit and miss.  From the pit to the bar, sometimes your treated with  the \"We love locals\" that stations prides it's self on and sometimes your not.

From what I hear the room rates are cheap.  I recently visited some friends that were staying in town.  I take it that the room rates are a direct reflection of the quality of the rooms.  They had a very Motel 6ish kind of vibe to them."}
{"text":"I find it appalling that the Station Casinos LLC policy is to allow customers to make racist comments towards customers and consider it a form of acceptable behavior at their properties.  Their policy is in direct contrast to the Station Casinos LLC Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy Statement, paragraph I.(i) which states \"maintaining a workplace that is free from discrimination or harassment based on race, gender, age, color, religion or any other characteristic that is unrelated to the Company's interests or otherwise protected by law\".

I sent personal letters (April 3, 2017) and emails (March 8, 2017) to the Fertitta brothers and upper management and never received a response from anyone regarding our complaint."}
{"text":"Was gambling for over 2 hours and not one person  had walked up to me. Not security for an I.D. (I'm 21 with braces lol) and I had 3 cocktail waitresses walk by and not stop to ask of I wanted a drink. The place wasn't busy I just don't see any reason to walk around aimlessly ignoring your customers."}
{"text":"Definitely not my finest choice of hotels in Vegas. Only stayed for one night since I was just passing through. Expensive for what it is, since the room was no better than a motel 6 equivalent. The front desk is inconveniently located in the middle of the casino, away from valet , main entrance, or parking lot access. Poor ventalation throughout, and extremely smoky. Service and food at the caf√© was just awful. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest place for $90 a night ($70 + resort fee & tax). Stained sheets, toothpaste on the hand towel, dirty bathroom countertop and stained shower. 1.5 stars for the convenient location."}
{"text":"The only reason to come to the Fiesta is for the cheap table games. If you like Pai Gow, this is one of, if not THE, only casino in Henderson with $5 Pai Gow.  Don't quote me on that, but I've never seen it anywhere else.

$5 Blackjack as well.

Bonus: dealers here are learning so they screw up a lot and pay you out when you don't deserve it."}
{"text":"One of the worst stays I had in any hotel. 
We made a reservation for a king bed non smoking room. They didn't have our room, they gave our room to someone else. They gave us a different room from what we reserved. And then once we got to our room, it smelt so bad, it was making us sick. They couldn't do anything about it. And I lost in the casino"}
{"text":"I have camped on rocks with no pillow and only a sleeping bag and slept better than I did while at the Fiesta. Prisoners at Gitmo may have better mattresses and pillows than those at the Fiesta. Our air conditioning barely functioned (and I think we can all agree that should be a priority in Vegas in July). The wifi was so slow as to be nigh on nonexistent. Our toilet only flushed about half of the time. Everything was dated and slow. For the price, I expected more, even knowing that it wasn't on the strip. Stay at the Motel 6; you'll get better value for your money."}
{"text":"Smokey, inattentive staff with poor restaruants. 
The movie theater, and the starbucks are the only thing that is saving this place for me..."}
{"text":"Stayed for two nights at this hotel for a dog show. Chose it because it is \"dog friendly\". 

We arrived at almost 1am and check in was very easy, staff was friendly. We had two \"dog friendly\" rooms on the second floor. Was unaware it was also a smoking floor, and none of us smoke. The stench is ripe first thing in the morning around 7, but it smells all day long.

Room was decent, pretty standard for an inexpensive Vegas hotel, however the shower head was awful and there is no fan or ventilation in the restroom. Gross. 

Casino was extremely quiet. At least the hours we were gambling it was. Love the penny slots and the fact that they still have $5 blackjack tables. My only gripe is there seems to be a staff shortage. Yes we gambled at very late hours, but only one cocktail waitress for the whole casino? One front desk employee on check out (asked me to continue waiting in line so she could take two hotel phone calls.

Otherwise a decent hotel for the price."}
{"text":"I did not stay at this hotel.  We stopped here for lunch on the Gray Line Deluxe Hoover Dam tour.  My reviews is just for the decor and buffet.

This place seems very low budget.  Older and not maintained very well.  Walking into the Fiesta, I got the feel that they place has not been updated since the 70's.  It smelled of damp and cigarettes.  

For the price (which was $7 for people just eating there, it was included in my not so Deluxe Gray Line tour), the buffet was fine.  It was fast food and comfort food. . .mac and cheese, pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs---most seemed to be frozen items.  

I am giving this place three stars because despite it's flaws, the staff could not have been nicer.  Everyone was very happy and positive.  They made you feel very welcome."}
{"text":"A disastrous property - and absolutely the worst brand under \"Stations\".

1.) Food quality is horrendous
2.) Staff in marginally friendly
3.) Cocktail service is abominable
4.) Management is unresponsive
5.) Game mix is poor / pay tables are not consistent with other off-strip properties
6.) Rooms need a major renovation
7.) Front desk is understaffed and overworked
8.) Slot club / food court comping is a confusing mess which takes a great deal of time. All food court comps should be issued by the kiosks on the gaming floor.

This property was lucky to receive a 1-star. But, that is about where it sits.....and will likely remain."}
{"text":"We check into this hotel recently, everything was going well up until returning home to find out we was charge double for one extra night stay. We have our receipt which shows zero balance paid in full for an extra night stay, but upon checking bank account we was charge double for an extra night stay, we called the billing department only to get the run around and excuses of manufactured lies as to why we was charge double. It never ceases to amaze me how greedy corporation and government entities will do anything they can to squeeze the little guy to feed their unending greed."}
{"text":"Went to the Buffet here with a 2 for one coupon from American Casino Guide, the food is so so, Was a little disappointed they didn't have an omelet station. 
The price is decent though, but would come back if had a 2 for one coupon."}
{"text":"Staying at the Fiesta Henderson as we speak. I'm guessing all the bad reviews finally had an effect on this place. Every employee was very nice. The Fuego steak house meal was very good, the buffet was fabulous as is the Grand Cafe. The room I'm staying in is clean and comfortable. 
The reason I'm giving it two stars is the casino. I've never lost so much money so fast on the slots. I'm talking losing 100 bucks at dollar video poker in 10 minutes tops. Even at the 100% return machines. Horrible and I have two days to go! Never again! I really don't care about food or a nice staff when the casino is sucking me dry at light speed! If you come to eat, fine. If you come to gamble, your screwed. Peace."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  A cheap, convenient casino located well inside the quiet brother of Las Vegas, Henderson.  People coming here being disappointed are simply expecting to much.  It isn't located on the strip for a reason - its a locals hang out.

I come here to play the $3 table games (craps, roulette, blackjack), cheap bingo, and live keno.  It's some of the cheapest minimums in town, save for a few really sketchy casino halls.  And its still a station casino, so there is a morsel of standard here.  The drinks are also cheap, or free if you're playing and you can somehow find a cocktail waitress.

It's smokey.  It isn't pretty inside.  And some of the bars (Amigos) are staffed by bartenders who can only hope to open a beer without forgetting the recipe. 

But that being said - it's still a great place to gamble cheap on a late night when driving all the way into Vegas just seems too far.  It's also far larger than any of the other casinos located on this side of Henderson."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the free parking. This is an average casino. I am at caisnos for the buffets, mainly. The buffet here is just average, for about an average price. I do like that they have stations for different types of cuisine (American, Asian, etc.) 

Curiously enough, the jalapeno pizza was the best thing there. I tried a bit of most of the menu items.

It is a quieter place than downtown Las Vegas and I enjoyed that too during Casino GamePlay."}
{"text":"The hotel has been remodeled. The old carpet is gone and it has been painted and updated. The new buffet is awesome. Food prices are great. Still smoke smell in the air but it is ok."}
{"text":"It's an off-Strip, locals casino. Lower-end for sure. But it can still be fun! There's a movie theatre here. There's a small arcade area. Keno was fun. It has cheap tables. And the buffet is super cheap. So yeah, if you want to game and are feeling cheap, this is a fine enough place to do it."}
{"text":"Room: average , 2 queen sized beds, hot shower and clean sheets. Average, as I said. 

Pool: lame! No drink bar outside, you have to walk thru the casino in your swim suit to get to the nearest bar. Also you have to ask for towels at the registration desk. Dumb! Just put them outside in the pool area. 

Casino: I know it's Nevada and smoking is allowed, but it's so hazy! Better ventilation is definitely needed. 

20 minute drive to the strip as long as there's no traffic. 

All in all, I'd never come back here. If you look on groupon you can get tons of great deals for better hotels either on the strip or within walking distance. Spend the extra money for a nicer stay."}
{"text":"I DO NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. We recently (May 2014) stayed at the fiesta and upon checking out of our room my fiancee reached under his side of the bed to make sure nothing had fallen from the nightstand and was stabbed by a USED HYPODERMIC NEEDLE that someone had left in the room and housekeeping some how failed to notice it laying just a few inches under the bed. Due to the negligence of this hotel my fiancees health and well being has been compromised. I strongly suggest to think twice before booking a room here."}
{"text":"I love it here, it's small and quaint. STAR is the best cocktail server on the floor.."}
{"text":"Review is specific to the Buffet.  Visited last night.  Had several items including the Mongolian BBQ.  Woke up in the middle of the night with a horrible case of food poisoning.  Been laying here all day unable to get out of bed for the most part and making trips to the bathroom all day.  

Food was marginal at best for a buffet.  Tried it because it was close to my house.  Won't go down that road again."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the hotel and we were nothing but pleased. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and the room was well furnished and clean. Very convenient as we were not here for the strip experience but rather visiting family/friends that reside in Boulder City. The hotel parking lot is huge, always spots available and easy to navigate around. Starbucks, Subway, a buffet, and a Denny's like Cafe Fiesta are all downstairs. And not to mention a Regal theaters? We had an absolute wonderful visit, and the price was affordable. Definitely recommend, and would stay here again."}
{"text":"Horrible, Rude Service!!!  Use to really like this place but not anymore!

My husband and I went here the night before Thanksgiving.  It was pretty dead and we could not get any cocktail service.  Gambeled quite a bit but we must of been in the \"no cocktail service section\".  We finally moved to the left of the table games, near the door to exit.  Played for 30 minutes and a cocktail waitress FINALLY took our order.  BUT....here is where our experience gets worse.  45 minutes go by and the same cocktail waitress walks by us yelling \"cocktails\" and completely ignores us, and without delivery of our drinks...I then proceed to put away her $1.00 tip.  15 more minutes go by and still NO drinks and she walks by us again smiling while my husband waves and signals for her to come to us and while looking right at us she turns her back and walks away in the opposite direction. At this point we are to furious and we decide to leave.  I wish I would of have gotten her name.  She was a hispanic woman in her 30's or early 40's with hair above her shoulders.  What a way to ruin a holiday vacation.  WE WILL NEVER BE BACK to this casino again!!!  Our relatives who live in Vegas, Henderson and Boulder City are well aware of this situation and it has put a big negative on this casino for them!"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy my stay here. As a casino I'm sure it's fine but as a hotel it's not that great. It's a cheap place and it shows. It's a bunch of little things they don't bother to spend money on. For example, they don't supply coffee in your room. That's no big deal I guess because they have a Starbucks on the casino floor. But you would then think they would have an entire staff working during the busiest part of the morning right? Nope, they had one person. My air conditioner wasn't working either. Again, small things by themselves but they all add up.

Update 10 min after posting: my TV stopped working."}
{"text":"Warning:  Do not, I repeat, stay here.  Here's why:
1.  Non-smoking room smelled like a smoking room. As soon as we walked in.  Smelled like weed.  Then find a lighter on the floor.  Front desk says they are sold out, so a room change is impossible.  They say they can send housekeeping to my room to spray and wipe down, but they never show up either.

2.  I ask the maid for extra towels, and she throws them into one big messy pile on the bathroom counter.

3. When maid came to clean the room, all she did was make 1 bed. We had 2 beds.  Left the other one unmade.  Extra pillows and bed cover for beds still on the floor and not placed back on made bed.  Lighter was still on the floor and room still  wreaked of the smoke smell.

4.  Called the front desk again the next day to speak to the manager, no manager on duty.  Clerk says he will email manager regarding my concerns and no follow up, phone call, contact whatsoever.  

Bottom line:  this place is horrible.  You have been warned.  I'd give it 0 's if I could!"}
{"text":"What can I say bad after winning a cool \"G\". Older casino for sure, we went there a year or so ago and saw Foreigner, an outdoors venue but a Good setup and show, a good place to stop on the way out of town!"}
{"text":"A bit seedy but the drinks are cheap and I won $40.00 bucks!!"}
{"text":"I only play Pai Gow, to my disappointment on a Saturday night they had only 1 table open.  Even more disappointment, I just bought in, the pit boss told me they are trying to close the table.  And that minimum bet was $25.  Player on the table already was playing 5.  I usually play 10 and 5.  I immediately cashed my chips and left.  Dealer was extremely rude.  Pit boss was an idiot for chasing players away.  Will never come back to this casino ever again."}
{"text":"We stayed here over Mother's Day weekend while we were visiting family. A family member got us a King suite to stay in for 3 nights.

I think some of the negative reviews of this place are a little harsh. It's conveniently located off the freeway in Henderson, and although the rooms could use a little updating, everything was clean and satisfactory. They had decent sized flat screen tvs. The bed was a little lumpy/squishy for my preference, but I slept fine. 

There was no coffee maker in the room, but the king suite did include a bar area with a sink and mini fridge in the second \"living room\" area, which was huge! We also had a nice view of the Las Vegas strip from afar. 

The weird thing was that the rooms are connected to other guests' rooms on both sides by adjoining doors. I don't know if all the rooms were like that or just the king suites... I didn't hear our neighbors at any time except during one morning when I heard their alarm go off and then heard them go into the bathroom and take a shower. I was already awake though, and I never was kept up at night or woken up by our neighbors so it wasn't a huge deal to me.

I think people need to keep in mind that this is more of a budget-friendly hotel and casino. We appreciated the Starbucks and dining options inside. They also have a Regal movie theater, which we didn't get a chance to go to, but it's a nice additional amenity."}
{"text":"Good buffet.  Popular place for locals. Decent selection of games."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no Stars I would. It is the worst place to gamble. I was there for several hours on Thanksgiving and not one Machine hit a jackpot. There was literally no service people around which made since because the machines were not paying. I can honestly say I have never been to a casino where you never heard any bells go off indicating that someone had one. What a dive.... hopefully they will Bulldoze it Someday..."}
{"text":"I stayed at this hotel over the cinco de mayo weekend for work and I woke up Sunday morning with over 40 bug bites all over my body.  I went to Urgent Care because I was getting really swollen and itchy.  I was very concerned because it was to the point where I had to be prescribed medicine.  When I called the hotel, I spoke to Rita at the front desk and I told her my situation asking if they could do a room check to see if there were any bugs around.  Although she was very apologetic and sincerely concerned about my situation, all she could do was transfer me to security.  When I was transferred, they just told me that they couldn't do anything unless if I file a complaint.  They also told me that if I want to file a complaint, I would have to be present at the hotel.  I live in California.  There is no way I'm driving all the way back just to put in a request for them to sweep the room for bugs, which is something they should be doing already for health and sanitary reasons. 
I have never had a problem with them from previous visits until this incident, and asking to look around for suspicious bug activity should not be a huge request.  In fact, for the benefit of a hotel who only has 2.5 stars, it should be their priority to treat their customers with sincerity and their rooms with cleanliness. 

NOTE: Pictures do not show ALL bug bites (for privacy reasons)"}
{"text":"This place is awful. They told me to take my money and leave after I had a couple lucky hands at blackjack."}
{"text":"Its not glamorous, but it's not sub par either. the casino is alot bigger than you expected and the steakhouse and buffets are well above expectations. The room is generic, but clean. They do charge a resort fee like everyone else but this is one of the few places (Hard Rock, Palace Station also) that includes LONG DISTANCE calls from your room in the resort fee.....ya know in case you lose your cell phone in your drunken stuper.

It was a good deal and a nice stay"}
{"text":"Big, nice, clean rooms that are cheap?  That's exactly what you get at Fiesta Henderson.  We just stayed from Saturday thru Thursday for just a little over $150 for the entire time.  Our room had 2 queen beds, was clean and had plenty of room.  The hotel & casino were nice, not overly fancy but nice.  The staff was very polite and helpful with anything we needed.

We ate a few meals at their buffet and one breakfast at the Denny's in the casino.  The buffet was middle of the road quality wise, but very cheap ($3.99 breakfast, $4.99 lunch and $5.99 dinner).  The food was decent, nothing spectacular but it was a decent meal each time.  For the price we paid it is hard to beat.

I will recommend this hotel to anyone I know going to Vegas.  It has to be the best bargain I've seen!"}
{"text":"Decent place, they have a lot of stuff from gambling and hotel to food court and movie theater even an arcade. It's not to fancy but definitely not an of strip dive.  I often gamble here and the benefits from the players card don't hurt."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was a decent size with a decent view. Clean, Layout was nice. The only complaint I have as a guest of the hotel is the mattress. I know that I wasn't staying at the Ritz, but they could definitely invest in some better mattresses."}
{"text":"The Fiesta is a nice casino. Staff is very friendly. Really, I mean friendly. They were available to help us navigate the many machines as we aren't seasoned gamblers. Went for a fun night out with family.  We actually won $150. The casino was clean, as we're the bathrooms. If I had one complaint it would be that the drink staff was few and far between. They apologized for the long wait. Understandably it was a Sunday evening so I can see where there wouldn't be many scheduled to work. But it is a local destination and should have better staffing. Then on the flip side, the Fiesta caf√© at 1230am has the best pancakes I have ever eaten. They are no joke, hardcore delicious! Giant portions, comfort food yumminess. Staff was pleasant and accommoding. 2 full breakfast meals for under $20, where else can you get that. All in all we were pleased with our visit to the Fiesta casino and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not worth the money, that's for sure! 

I booked a month out and asked THREE times to make sure we were getting a NON-smoking room. But no, when we got there \"we only have smoking rooms left\". I was very unhappy! All my clothes, even the ones I didn't wear smell of smoke! I asked them to come spray and clean the room (because they suggested it) and it did nothing. 

The carpet was filthy, the bathroom was dimly lit, the sink kept plugging, the shower faucet drips, the window didn't open, and it took them 45 minutes to bring me up the extra blankets I called to request. The beds had a divot down the middle and made crinkling noises because there was some kind of plastic mattress cover under the sheets. 

When they maids \"cleaned\" the room, all they did was make the bed. I purposely placed a couple items around the room/bathroom to see if they got moved during the cleaning process - nope! They didn't even leave us new cups for the bathroom, or empty the dirty ashtray that I burned matches in trying to get rid of the stench of cigarettes! 

This place is not worth the price. The ONLY good thing about it was the pool area and the gift shop. 

The ONLY reason I didn't change hotels was because they'd already charged me a \"holding fee\" for the room they DID NOT give me."}
{"text":"I've done a little gambling here and did ok. I like the movie theater, that's pretty much why I go here. $2 bud or bud light and $1 hot dogs is sweet."}
{"text":"As I've said before, I'm a firm believer in you get what you pay for and you can't review a 35 dollar a night hotel like you expected it to be luxurious. This hotel is a good location for visiting our family who lives in green valley, and we picked it because of the price and the fact that they allow dogs (we found out during the stay that dogs will no longer be allowed in 2016). That said, we probably wouldn't stay again once the new dog policy goes into effect and would stay at a dog friendly hotel or sunset station instead, which is similar price and a much nicer hotel."}
{"text":"I hope you are reading this before you even think about calling this hotel for a reservation. DO NOT COME HERE TO STAY OVERNIGHT! So, I had the room booked by my sister because it's an \"affordable hotel\". I looked online and it honestly didn't even look too bad! So we drive in to the hotel and everything on the outside is completely outdated. We walk inside and okay I see a basic little casino, but again extremely outdated. So we go up to our bedroom... another thing outdated! No fridge, No Microwave, No coffee machine, Not even a simple Bible in the drawer (which these are things that I've had in EVERY ROOM I ever stayed in!) The window will not even open in the slightest bit. The bathroom has NO FAN OR AIR VENT. The toilets look so disgusting you don't even want to sit on them. As soon as we turned on the air-conditioning vent it smelt heavily of cat urine and it did the whole two days I was there it still smelt! So we go onto sleeping in the bed... HARD AS A ROCK! And the pillows were too! The air conditioning vent wouldn't even work properly so we sweat... all night. I'm so upset we payed for two nights at this place. I hope you never have to go to this hotel. It's a vacation ruiner."}
{"text":"We stayed for 3 nights and we will not be returning. Rooms are super small and old. The hallways smell like windex and chemicals. The restaurant service was horrible and the waitress was rushing us and we felt like we were inconveniencing her when we asked for simple things like napkins and ketchup."}
{"text":"Had a Station's perk coupon for a very good room rate & used it for a guest. Have had friends stay at Sunset & GVR which were both very nice. This guest had a pet & so had to book at Fiesta Henderson. Not quite as bad as the likes of the 4 Queens on Fremont,  but not far off. Low ceilings, view of the HVAC system out the 2nd story window. No coffee, hot water took 10 minutes. Bed linens were fine but the whole floor reeked of smoke though it was a non smoking room. Noisy, ALL night long. I won't be booking my guests there again, even if they are the only Station that is pet friendly. Pet friendly shouldn't put you in the sub par rooms/views. Pet owners often have a ton of money & class. Perhaps this should be considered by Station casino management."}
{"text":"Two words:  BED BUGS. Stayed here for a weekend during November 2015, and we could not believe the terrible experience.  Bites all over...  Emailed the hotel management about the incident.  Radio silent.  Casino & restaurants were fine.  Just avoid sleeping here."}
{"text":"The Cafe at the Fiesta in Henderson was a very good experience this time around!!!  If you want chinese food......this is the place to go!!!!  The Mongolian Beef is excellent, Orange Peel Chicken...excellent, War Won Ton Soup...excellent and the Chicken Egg Rolls and Pot Stickers are Unbelievably Delicious!!!!!!  Never expected great chinese food at a cafe....but whoever does the chinese cooking here....should get a raise!!!!  And it's reasonably priced!  I'll be back this weekend!!!!  :)"}
{"text":"Well you get what you pay for I guess. First, upon getting to our room we found a disabled smoke detector sitting on the bathroom counter with a handwritten note saying \"needs a new battery\". That battery and note stayed there for the entire weekend, with no room attendant or maintenance member bothering to fix it. I can only wonder how long it's been there. Maybe they were expecting us to provide the batteries and reattach it to the bedroom ceiling? We also didn't have a shower curtain for the first few nights of the stay, but it mysteriously reappeared the last night we were there. Beware- walls are also paper thin and you can hear every conversation and sound in the hallways and neighboring rooms loud and clear. Ew. Added one star for the dirt cheap Roulette table minimum, which was probably the only plus."}
{"text":"I only got a chance to check out the casino portion of this property one time several years back, while I was visiting Green Valley Ranch just down the road.

A bit smaller than some of the other Station properties, but the overall layout was very similar.

The only reason I can't give it a five star rating is because at the time, they seemed to require having a separate, property-specific player's card, despite the fact that it's in the Station chain."}
{"text":"This establishment has gone down hill. The rooms were filthy.  They didn't give us the room we booked and had conformation on,  We ate in the coffee shop and were 1 of 3 tables in their but still received horrible service. I think it is a shame that Stations is celebrating there 40th anniversary and instead of focusing on customer service they really didn't care.  It makes me wonder why?  Maybe they have unhappy employees Hmmm? Perhaps there is poor moral? I would never recommend you stay here."}
{"text":"JUNE 17, 2017, minus zero, for the wait staff at the buffet, ESPECIALLY R**Y....(don't ever leave a tip ahead of time...which we didn't do, thank goodness).  

A buffet is self serve affair so the only thing the wait staff really has to do is get drinks, clear the table and ask how you are, zero on all counts with this idiot, R**y.

R**Y completely shunned us and we dont know why...R**Y waited on everyone around us, so obviously he didn't give a shit...he should be fired, immediately!

We watched him make at least 30 trips to the kitchen with dirty buffet plates, passing us by each time WITHOUT STOPPING ONCE.

WE SPOKE WITH a lovely manager named Barbie who witnessed this insanity, who kept saying, \"R**y has never done this!\"  That is a \"fail\" comment as R**y demonstrated bias right under her nose!  She told us she will pull the videotape and watch his full actions. 

UPDATE:  JUNE 19, 2017
We ended up with 2 free dinners, and this waitress came over in 1 minute to take our drink order.  Thank you, Mary."}
{"text":"This hotel is for folks on a budget looking for a room with the basics. It served its purpose for our trip and would recommend it to someone who isn't looking for all the bells and whistles. I saw pizza, subway and fatburger plus movie theater, bars and lots of slot machines. Didn't do much in the hotel besides sleep. Fatburger tasted horrible and took forever."}
{"text":"Take a Motel 6, make it 10 stories high, add a casino and buffet, and VOILA! - you have this property. Hotel adds ten dollar per night resort fee to your Expedia reservation, which is dishonest.."}
{"text":"Pros:  Desserts are muy delicioso!  (most buffet desserts taste like cardboard).

Cons:  you have to ask the lady for the dessert you want.  Yes, I want the Boston creme pie AND a brownie AND the red velvet cupcake please.

Con #2: our 30 minute wait to be seated AFTER we paid.   This place is seriously understaffed.  

Verdict: for a buffet, decent food, shockingly good desserts, horrible wait=not worth $10.99."}
{"text":"Okay walked around here a bit before our movie, lay outs nice clean not busy. Write more later did not stay here just cause I use to be a local and this is a locals type thing."}
{"text":"Pretty Cool local Casino to play at, except for you do have your regulars that come in and just stay drunk,and hover around you from time to time at the tables. And they might ask you a strange question or two...YIKES...and you also have the option to make convenient sports bets at will. But on another note,This buffet is a decent buffet,I would say a little bit better than average. But Being a Vegan, and all the salad bars I have hit,this is by far NOT a top 25 salad bar in Vegas in my Yelping opinion. They are a few Veggies short of being a top 25 salad bar, LOL...if they add a few more salad bar options then maybe they will make 25 on my Vegan salad bar list...question is will I ever go back??? \"MAYBE\"if they add more options to the salad bar,or if they're like the last Salad bar in Vegas left to serve a hungry Vegan...lol!!!"}
{"text":"A little gem outside Vegas on the way to Arizona. Fairly cheap hotel with a large casino area. It was quiet when we stayed there but we noticed there is also a movie theater for added entertainment. Room was clean, just the pillows weren't super comfy. No breakfast included in the room but there is a convenient Starbucks on property."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister and aunt.. worse slots  would hit bonuses  and didn't get a penny. Rediculious. . I was in town visiting  my godfather so when I saw the godfather slot it was a must. WRONG.. how you can hit  3 bonus spins and get nothing is rediculious  and don't order a drink while playing because you will never get it. Which seems to be the vegas theme everywhere. But after numerous  attempts to get a drink and a few hours later I got a very delious Bloody Mary or maybe it just seemed that way since I waiting so long."}
{"text":"It's like a fucking motel, get new employees. They treat you like shit. Even better you have to yell at them employees to get attention or better yet give you good service. Please don't come here or better yet if your lost and brainless this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We stayed 2 nights. While this is an older hotel, it seemed to be clean. Upon arriving to our room I checked the bed & surrounding areas for bed bugs as I have heard the stories about hotel rooms. I didn't look hard enough or just missed them all together. The first night I was bit 4 times on my chest and the second night 9 times on my back. Had I realized they were bed bug bites after the first night I would have left. After being home for almost a week I have had no further bites and hope we didn't bring any home with us. While I had no issues with the staff I will never return to this Station property"}
{"text":"Zero how sad, I'm here right now I can't believe what I'm seeing awful! With the talent in Vegas this place SUX ! I'm  a Veteran wow this is the best you could do super SLAP IN THE FACE  thx Stations sux my time super wasted!"}
{"text":"Their customer service is very good.  Bartenders are very greedy and thankless.  Many times after tipping 100.00 after a jackpot you rarely get a thank you.  They don't know you just broke even for the day.  Makes me not want to tip anymore.  Why is it always expected?  I hate to stiff.  Never get a tip when you lose, which is usually the case."}
{"text":"My husband and I travel and are on the road a lot, and this is by far the worst hotel we've stayed in. The non-smoking room smelt HORRIBLE. Like dead animals guys, I'm not even kidding. My husband took apart the AC unit thinking something was dead in there. The showers were awful, no water pressure and the water kept getting super cold.. and then really hot! Sheets were old and well used, same with the pillows and towels. Breakfast was a total mislead. They made you think you can get a $3.99 breakfast.. my husband and I sit down and start to order and that price is for player cards only. Which is completely free at the front desk, no one informed us that you have to have that card for all the special prices for the hotel. We were unable to leave the restaurant to get these cards once we realized (from the rude waitress) that you needed these cards for the special price, which was not advertised anywhere. We paid $25 for a terrible breakfast. DO NOT STAY HERE. We left the next morning, complaining, the staff could careless."}
{"text":"Non existent payouts. Impossible to win.

Folks don't be fooled. This place and others like it exist for two reasons.

Somewhere for gambling addicts to go to lose their money.

Overflow for tourists when the strip hotels are booked or high priced. 

No tourist in their right mind would stay or play here if they had a choice of staying on the strip.

Like another reviewer stated, they need to be investigated by the Nevada Gaming Commission. Station casinos cheat and their payouts are below the minimum threshold."}
{"text":"House keeping stole from my wife a very expensive bottle of perfume. And the tub backed up with sewage while trying to take a shower at 1:00 in the morning and they did nothing. Security director is the one to talk to about the theft, and he has been out for the past 5 days and I have been told to call tomorrow each day. I recommend you stay in and eat out of a dumpster than this septic tank."}
{"text":"Here is another local casino that we gamble at and of course don't stay at either.  When we go here, it''s either food or gambling.  I like the slots here (I don't know if it's looser than others) and the tables aren't bad.  Their Festival Buffet isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Gross!   I have been to a few other Station casinos and this is probably the worst!  I this is the second worst place I've slept in my life.   The room smelled horrible, a smoke and foul smell. The sheets felt awful.  I literally felt dirtier leaving this hotel.  The buffet had horrible service, old food and dirty tables. Do yourself a favor and don't stay here!"}
{"text":"At first it seemed as though the Fiesta hotel might be a great place to stay because of recommendations and the low price, but it is definitely some place I wouldn't stay anytime in the near future unless they changed a few things.
* Better service - many of the staff were not accommodating nor friendly
* Cleaner rooms/hotel in general - the carpet was filthy and rooms weren't cleaned well
* More things for kids to do
* Clearer rules and amenities - they say Internet is complimentary in the rooms, but desk staff say it costs a certain amount per day and no room coffee
* Better food - actual hotel food wasn't good, but Subways, Villas, Starbucks was good
* Cheaper ATM fees - $3.75 is way too expensive to be pulling money out of an ATM
Our room wasn't ready when we arrived to check in, but all of our friends who arrived before/around the same time we did had rooms ready. They told us to check a later to see if a room was ready. Another person, who arrived later than us, was given the room we had wanted, which was right across from our friends. They then proceeded to give us the very last room in the hall, but everyone else from our group on that floor was towards the front of the hall. Eventually, they conceded us a room about a quarter of the way from the end of the hall.
When another of our friends arrived with her family, they were given rooms on the floor above us. All three of those rooms smelled like cigarette and cigar smoke. The underside of the comforters in our friend's room was dirty; and after getting help from the maid to remove all the linens and spray the room with air freshener, they found the smell tolerable enough for the night. They gave her a different set of rooms on the Seventh Floor when all of us were on the 2nd floor.
We were there for an event and needed a space to practice because none of the rooms were large enough to be a suitable dance space. So, another member of the group talked with the desk people and the manager to see if there was some way to get a room or another place to practice. None of them were of any help. They said they couldn't unlock any of the meeting rooms. Luckily, we discovered that the pool area was large enough to practice. 
On the second day, the pool was closed without any notification prior to our arrival. The only notification we received was a letter from the hotel stating the pool would be closed all day Saturday and that arrived somewhere around 11pm Friday night. It turned out that the pool had been closed for a wedding reception. And since we were using the space to practice, we couldn't practice. A lot of our group had been planning on leaving Sunday, and many of them had young children who had been looking forward to the pool now had nothing to do and most of them left the hotel to find a suitable activity for their children.
Our group director tried to get a comp night for us because of the closed pool and the hotel staff's refusal to accommodate our need for a room, but the manager wouldn't give the comp night. Our director was able to get us a $20 food discount per room. But because much our group had planned to check out on Sunday, many of them were not able to take advantage of this.
A few of us tried to take advantage of the discount by going to the buffet. However, they told us that in order to split our group of 8 people into three groups we would not be guaranteed tables near each other. So, we had to dish out $30. The food at the buffet ranged from good to okay to bad. A lot of it was dried out, hard as a rock, or covered with too much sauce. 
Although there is an arcade, a movie theatre, and a pool available to the kids, the arcade was tiny and half of the machines in the arcade were broken and the movie theatre wasn't showing any movies that didn't interest any of the kids and the pool was closed for an entire day. Kids weren't even allowed to stand by the post in front of the reception desk because it was too close to the machines. The entrances to the hotel should not have slot machines 5 feet from the entrance because there is nowhere for kids to wait if they are waiting for their parents to check in.
The air conditioner in our room was noisy and the remote to set for auto start/auto off was broken. The seal on the bottom of our tub was almost gone and there were stains on the wall; one of the rooms had a broken ironing board and no iron, which was greatly needed; and, the door of another was not straight and made the door difficult to open."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place less stars. Let's start with the non-smoking rooms, they reek of smoke. What about their table drink service, it's non-existent on a Saturday! It literally took our table 30 minutes to get a drink of water because all the waitresses were laid off.
The straw that broke the camel's back though was Fiesta's shady 'ATM' cash skimming machines. I tried to use those AtM machine 5 different times in the early morning of a NCAA tournament weekend. Instead of telling me ' insufficient funds' or ' you're wrong!' I kept getting an error message telling me to remove my debit card. At NO TIME did the ATM machine tell me, ' oh by the way we're going to charge you $2,50 on top of your regular bank out of network me withdrawal fee'.  This happened 5 TIMES! With $0
Withdrawan. This ended with $7.50 in ATM withdrawal fees with $0.00 given from their super exclusive ATM machine.

Don't get me started on their shitty 'hot tub'."}
{"text":"How is a casino buffet gonna charge full price for a child that will barely eat anything? They must be hurting in their wallet to be doing that. Absolute bull shit. 
Hopefully the food is good... Maybe, I'll be able to understand why they would charge full price for a toddler.  

So far our server is very friendly. So for her, she gets five stars, but the initial service at the front counter, sad..

Food was ok, still think kids should at least be only half price."}
{"text":"This review is for the casino only. 

We used to play here all the time and had so much fun and then we started to notice the  changes in the machines. It started gradually and then over the past several years this casino dwindled down to a very boring place to gamble. As I said it used to be so much fun but they took out all their fun machines and changed them out to either low payouts or no payouts (especially those money sucking penny machines!). And some of the old machines they left have been \"tweaked\" (I believe that's the word a casino host from another casino once used to describe to me what they do to their machines on occasion.) Lots of casinos, well probably all of them are doing this but not as repulsive as this place. And where did all the fun video poker machines that were on the floor go? You can only fool people for so long. And this is why people don't gamble as much anymore."}
{"text":"I love Fiesta Henderson! They are freaking fantastic. Homey, fun, local friendly, more of an older crowd &/or family friendly vibe. We stayed here to visit our grandparents in Henderson & I felt like we were surrounded by other adoptive grandparents here at the casino the entire time.

The rooms are clean, nice, quiet. I just loved it. 

I also loved the buffet & food located in the casino, & such good prices. I would definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"Things are getting better. Amy strenger (the casino host) called me. Invited me to meet and greet with the GM. I also got comped dinner and free slot play. Thank you Amy! This was exactly what I needed. I appreciate everything you've done. We'll be returning as usual.  
-Margarita F."}
{"text":"Casino near empty this morning so we moved around to dozens of slots. Tightest ever.  Example: 30 free games on one - total bonus win was $3.95.  On the diamonds game (like cherries on fire but diamonds) my bet was $1.50 and on a 10 spin bonus I won less than $5 .not returning."}
{"text":"My fianc√©e and I had a date night at the buffet. It was small but cozy. The food selection wasn't the greatest, but it was ok. The cashier didn't ask if we wanted alcohol when we went to pay, which I thought was standard procedure at all casino buffets. Our waitress wasn't very attentive to our needs, as far as refilling our drinks. We had to flag her down once, and another time we had to flag down another waiter. Subpar service. I doubt we will be back to this buffet again."}
{"text":"I come to the Fiesta Henderson for three reasons.

1) $8 movie tickets any time
2) the buffet w/my bogo coupon
3) Amigos (closed;make that 2 reasons)

I don't know how a casino named the Fiesta can close the mexican restaurant inside its casino. I went to go eat at Amigos this last Saturday night to fill my woman up w/tacos and margaritas, but NOOOOOOOOOO... These rat bastards officially are closed. The buffet was closed. All they have at the food court is a pizza spot, Fatburger, and I cant remember, I think a subway.

And the sportbook sucks. Wow that crap is horrible. All the stations casinos are getting made over, except the Fiesta."}
{"text":"The gaming is great as i enjoy playing here. Wish there were more of a variety of newer games. Staff seems good. Some cocktail waitresses are oblivious.  The cafe is not that great. Ate there and sat at the counter at 1 am one time and watched my food sit under the hot lights for 15 minutes as my waitress was no where to be found.  Next time i sat at a booth and if it wasn't for the guy who sat me to come back and take my order i might still be sitting there.  I saw my waitress only once.  Haven't tried any other restaurant yet.  Ate at the buffet once and that was enough. Couldn't use my points to pay because the system was down. Unacceptable if you ask me."}
{"text":"Do Not Waste your time here. The most hostile and sad casino I have ever been to. Like the opening casino scene in Tombstone, with Billy Bob Thornton. It appears that every blackjack player at the 5 dollar table was betting to save their life or at least to get some money for their six kids to eat. Sad really, I only play to have fun and lose money. Part of the experience. These lonely losers are angry: from the fat, scruffy white guy in mossy oak camo(It blows my mind why anyone would wear camo in a casino), to the tattooed native American/mexican looking mutt mix with pony tail and hat. These poor people need to win to survive. I will never be back to this sad and pathetic place. You get a better vibe at a gas station."}
{"text":"Gamble here at your own risk! This is my third time staying here for a local event and this is the worst casinos I have been too. Most of the gamblers are local elderlys and I promise you NO ONE IS A WINNER!! The only good thing about this place is the $3 minimum black jack table. Slots are super tight and will eat your money. At other casinos I  usually win some lose some but my goodness.. you can literally go days at the Fiesta Henderson without getting a decent win. Stay here fine but gamble here and you will lose all your money in no time."}
{"text":"Very overpriced ($139/night on weekends, plus extra fees and taxes), and less than stellar rooms that reek of old stale smoke.  Rooms are very outdated, walls are paper thin so bring ear plugs and pray your neighbors are considerate enough to not let their kids run amok at 7am if you want to sleep in!  No coffee in room so you are forced to go down through the casino area to buy overpriced coffee at the indoor Starbucks.  No room service option (that I could find), and no fridge or anything to keep anything cold.  The Fuego restaurant in house was great though!  Delicious food and great service!"}
{"text":"The Saturday champagne brunch includes shrimp at Mongolian grill and lots of it plus all the champagne you can drink. The petite Asian server is the best."}
{"text":"Came here expecting to get a decent nonsmoking room, but found that prices surged even though the person over the phone told me if I checked in earlier than usual, it would be another extra $15 or $50 (I must've misheard but it was either $15 or $50). Checking in early ended up being another $135 along with our reservation (64$)  and we got a smoking room (no other non smoking rooms were available) even though the person over the phone told me many rooms were available. The smoky room was terrible. I barely got any sleep and coughed a lot, but had no choice but to stay there. Extremely dissatisfied with this place. It's pretty mediocre. Starbucks downstairs is pretty nice, but the staff over the phone just doesn't communicate well. Also just read a review that someone got bedbugs. I'm just so disgusted and hope I didn't get bedbugs. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"I was sport betting approx. $3,000.00 a day between here and the GVR until the sports book ticket writers began to be rude and impolite at the counter.  I guess they thought the Fiesta could afford to lose some business.  But, sarcasm is the rule in Vegas not the exception.  So, no-don't stay or play here.  A good alternative is the Homewood Suites (a Hilton property) on Eastern Ave.  10 minutes to the Strip and McCarren.  No resort fees...no long elevator rides...no long walk from the parking garage plus you can get a hugh room with a full kitchen and earn Hilton Honors Points at the same time.  Also, just south of Mandalay Bay off Russell Rd. about 5 or 6 chain hotels are located within easy proximity to the airport and Strip.  Just google street view of this area.  No way can you be long hauled by your cab ride to this location either.  Fiesta is too far from the strip and driving in a rental car is awkward  for someone that is unfamiliar with the area and it is not recommended.  It's about a $70.00 cab ride to Fiesta."}
{"text":"There was nothing really great about it.  Just a casino. We stopped in there because on our yelp, it said there was an El Torito in the area.  Well it wasn't in there.  
I'm sure you can enjoy yourself here at this casino just like the rest of them around town.    You might even win somethng because it's a local casino!"}
{"text":"The Fiesta is a good local casino.  I've never stayed in the hotel, just the casino and some of the restaurants/buffet so this review excludes the hotel itself.

This is one of the middle to lower end casinos within the Station Casinos chain.  The advantage here is that the gambling benefits a better than at their other properties.  If you are a regular player, then you are likely to get into the bonus drawing for their frequent players club.

I like to play the table games here because of the low minimum bets they allow, $5 at most tables almost all of the time.

The buffet is adequate.  It is not the best in Vegas and Vegas is known for its great buffets.  However, the buffet is fairly cheap and there is a good variety of food:  American, Chinese, Mongolian grill, Italian, Mexican.  Get a cup of the clam chowder when you go!"}
{"text":"I think the hotel is nice. The rooms are descent. Theres not much to do other than gamble and play in the arcade. You could eat and watch a movie if you wanted to. Your close to lake mead from this hotel. Your also right next to a main freeway"}
{"text":"The cafe is good.  The tables are
 Fine... but the hotel is absolutely awful. Fire alarm went off at 5 am. But not in my room. Good thing it was just smoke from a different floor... but since I was up and hear something faint in the hall way we were able to get out in case it was a major fire. They let someone with a dog next door. Dog barked at paper thin walls for hours... Till like 2 in the am"}
{"text":"The buffet suffered from poor staffing and very mediocre food when we went there today. Next to the \"food\" that the Circus Circus buffet slops out, this was the poorest buffet I have tried here in Las Vegas. Poorly layed out with deserts in the middle .  It took the server 3 trips to bring the cream for the coffee. Then one bright spot was the ground up Butter Fingers for topping the ice cream. Will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Always a fun time. Their table games are affordable. We're treated the same a high rollers even when we are making the minimum bet. Awesome staff."}
{"text":"The food at the buffet was uh, passable.. The gal that insisted we get a players card was sweet, and the attendant came to us, so that was really cool. Again I wish the food had been better. Not sure I will have a reason to come back.."}
{"text":"Love this place! Perfect place to stay away from the strip. Great food options... Starbucks inside.... wonderful buffet. Terrific prices and staff and good location if you want to be away from the strip. Right off the freeway."}
{"text":"For the cheap price, I wasn't expecting to get much from this hotel. We originally had a reservation to stay here for five nights over 4th of July weekend. However, our stay was cut short. Immediately when we arrived at the room, the room was extremely hot, as the AC had been off. We turned on the AC then left for the evening. When we returned around 10pm the room was still very hot and the AC was off again, so we turned it back on and got in bed. About 10 minutes later the AC turned off, with the room still hot. We quickly realized what was happening. Our AC refused to stay on and we were about to suffer through a long night of getting up every 10 minutes to turn the AC back on until we could fall asleep, and then wake up sweating in the morning in our hot room. It was horrible. On top of all that, the AC is VERY loud and the front desk informed us that the hotel was sold out for the weekend, so switching rooms was not a possibility. With 110 degree whether outside, it is unacceptable for a hotel to not have functioning AC. 

The next night we canceled the rest of our reservation and switched over to the Holiday Inn. I just wish we had gone there first."}
{"text":"Fiesta's cafe seems to be getting worse when I consider the last two visits. Took friends here two weeks ago and our greeting from Arianne  (or whatever?) when we were seated was to tell us we'd have a long wait as she looked exasperated and walked away. After 15 minutes she returned with a piss poor attitude and took our orders. The food was pretty much an embarrassment to feed to people we brought here.  She was very snippy and after looking at other reviews and photos I see this must be her normal approach. Today we came by for breakfast and it came out within a couple of minutes but cold & salty hash browns on both our plates prompted us to ask for country potatoes instead to go with our over cooked scrambled eggs. Even worse so I'd have to say don't bother driving here as a local, it's cheap but not even worth eating if it were free!"}
{"text":"This casino is great if you know what to expect.  Granted, I've never stayed in the hotel or eaten there, but I appreciate the drinks, staff, theater, and pretty much everything I've experienced there.  The movie theater has great prices, is clean, sells overpriced beer, and is never crowded.  Again, as long as you're not expecting the Bellagio, or even Green Valley Ranch, this place is great for locals, is conveniently located, and a good place to relax Aftr work without spending a ton of money... would I eat at the buffet there ? Being a Chef, and one of the opening team at Bacchanal, most likely not; but that's not what I go there for, and I'm sure it's good for the price.."}
{"text":"First of all, the buffet is so gross and everything looks awful. The service is horrible and the food looks like it has been sitting out all day. I hardly ate much and just sipped on my drink. When I went the restroom, I saw 3 employees go the restroom and then leave. Then worked in the buffet and how gross. They didn't wash their hands that is so nasty. You don't even realize how much I wanted to throw up after seeing that. This casino is very sketchy and I would not let anybody come here. Save your self the trouble and go to Green Valley so much better than this horrible disaster."}
{"text":"In one word I can sum this poor excuse for a hotel...DUMP.  It's awful and there is really no excuse for how old, run down and just grimy this place is.  The guest rooms are awful too.  Sure it's better than sleeping in the car but not by much."}
{"text":"If I had read some of these reviews, we might not have stayed here, but it was close to family so we booked it for a 4 day weekend in April. Easy access, right off the highway. No traffic problems.
   The hotel and casino, inside and out, was very clean. Check in was quick and our special request for a room on lower floor levels was fulfilled. Our room was clean, quiet and comfortable. All of the staff were pleasant and helpful. The Rewards Center ladies explained special promos and veterans discounts to me and my wife.
   Plenty of slots and tables to play, loose enough to keep my wife playing for hours. Music in casino was great, not too loud, no hip hop or Justin Beber, mostly tunes from the 60's & 70's.
   Drink service in casino was alittle slow, not enough waitresses, but once they found us, they checked on us every half hour.
   Breakfast special for under $5, fantastic !! Great service too.

   Thanks Fiesta Henderson for making our stay FANTASTIC !!"}
{"text":"The Regal Cinemas (12 screens) opened 12-Oct-2007 . For regal cinemas (the largest circuit in the US), this was their first all digital projection theatre and includes 3D movies. It provides serious competition with the aging Cinedome theaters less than 3 miles away.
==========
The fact that there is a hotel at all in these locals casinos (224 guest rooms and suites) has more to do with the zoning laws that won't let them open casinos without a hotel. These casinos are about cheap food, entertainment and the 1655 slot machines, 25 table games and 5 poker tables, plus race and sports book.

This Fiesta is in much better shape than the Fiesta on Rancho RD"}
{"text":"Review for casino only:

I've been to the Fiesta Henderson many times, mostly before there were other Station casinos of better quality and nearer to home.  I like their coffee shop and the Mexican place was very good.

Unfortunately, now I use the Fiesta as a place to meet up with friends when we go hiking.  You don't know how easy it is to just say, \"Meet me under the big Fiesta sign out front.\"  No one misses that!  Well, there was the time that a friend went to the Fiesta Rancho and totally missed the sign.

I stopped here Monday to meet hiking friends and I went in to use the bathroom before leaving on our great hike.

One of these days, I'll return to the Fiesta for some food and play and give this place the better review it deserves."}
{"text":"This is about the Fiesta Henderson Hotel but I can't find where it has gone and it's only showing the steakhouse now. I didn't try the steakhouse so I don't know how it is, but here is my hotel experience. Where to begin, when we arrived it was very hard to figure out where to actually check in. Then we were told by two different people two different things about the pet fee, one said one time fee another said 35 per day, also we were told by housekeeping manager that each room had a coffee maker in them but when we got there were told if we wanted one we had to pay 20 a day for it! When we checked in we were not given a recipient told we would get it at the end of the trip then when we checked out we were still not given a recipient saying everything was already taken care of. A couple days after we got a bill on our account of 310, when we made the reservations on Expedia it was a total of 269. I know there are hotel fees but even with them it wouldn't add up to 310. So we called their front desk and Debbie told us what she thinks happen is they went back and took out the third party discount and added their weekend fee. So I have repeatedly tried to call Kristen, one of their managers, and she has yet to answer or call me back. Never staying at this hotel ever again l. If any of you do and book with a third party make sure to get a recipient no matter what and keep a very close eye on your account after Incase this happens to you."}
{"text":"Need a room for the night?  This isn't a bad place to stay. Super cheap.  Bed was comfortable.  Could have been more cleanly ie random piece of plastic on floor, three inch long hair in tub.  No light bulb in one of the lamps.   Good theater and food establishments.  This place is a mixed bag.
Nice pool, but my daughter slipped.  She needed four stitches.  Went to security.  I got a band-aid.  Was surprised that they did not even do a report."}

{"text":"Fiesta Henderson is a perfect example of getting what one pays for. It's an older hotel & casino, with very few bells and whistles but it gets the job done for people that need an inexpensive place to sleep and shower while in Las Vegas. Fiesta is part of the Station Casino chain, which recently started the 'We Love Locals' program, so every week they offer a different deal for me to take advantage... 

Since I live in Henderson, when out of town visitors ask me what inexpensive hotel they should stay at that is near me, I recommend Fiesta. Yes, they have a resort fee. MOST Vegas hotel and casinos do these days. Even with the resort fees, rooms here are very inexpensive. 

My mother in law recently stayed at Fiesta and I was with her when she checked it. The employee that helped her was pleasant, even when my MIL questioned the resort fees. She also gave my MIL a sheet with coupons she could use for free slot play, and then when she was sitting at a nearby machine another employee stopped to make sure she was doing everything correctly to get her free play. 

A month later, my mom stayed here for a long weekend. She checked in without me but every time I went to Fiesta to meet up with her, employees were saying hello and telling me to have a nice visit. Employees here are very friendly and helpful, and not in the 'I am just doing this because it is my job' kind of way. 

The rooms are basic but they get the job done. I noticed housekeeping putting newspapers outside every room when I was there on Saturday morning, apparently this is one of the things that the resort fee pays for but unlike some Strip casinos they actually bring it to you, which I thought was nice. There is a small pool and spa to relax in, a cheap buffet and a movie theater. 

Both my mother and mother-in-law were happy with their stays at Fiesta. And if a place can make both of them happy, it makes me happy. 

If you visiting the Henderson area and just need an inexpensive place to sleep that is ran by friendly employees, Fiesta will get the job done. Don't go into it expecting a 5 star experience and you shouldn't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Fiesta is just okay. And when I mean okay, I'm not necessarily sending my out of town friends/family to Fiesta for the Las Vegas experience.  Really not much at this casino.  It's small, it's very smokey, and there's really not much to eat here. But they have slots and everyone loves slots.  Everybody that gambles, that is. I haven't done much gambling or even eating here, but have started to frequent this place strictly for their sports book.  I'm at this side of town almost weekly and find that Fiesta is one of the more convenient locations to place a quick football wager.  Parking is easy and the casino usually isn't busy.  There...The End.

{"text":"An average hotel that is one step above Motel 6.   They allow pets and we had a room right next to dog room. Dog barked all night on Saturday and part of the day on Sunday.  Later on as I check out I found out our floor was a pet free zone.  No apology or some type of compensation for my lack of sleep due to the fact they did NOT follow up on my complaint from Saturday.  Let's me know they don't care about there customers. 

The water pressure was 0 so you had to run around in the shower to get wet and rinse off soap.  The shower curtain looked like it came from a dumpster; the 70's furniture and old style TV that covered up the mirror was enough for me not come back on top of the crappy air conditioner.  $12 for a resort fee and $100 deposit was a bit much for a place so poorly ran and bad shape.  We have decided that Flamingo or Bally's will be our next destination for Vegas. 

The only great part about our stay was that our valet and bell hop was the same person and was a very nice man.  Very attentive and quick to bring our bags to the room."}
{"text":"Richard please read this review if any!  Your casino host treat the guest and their co- workers  like they are invisible low lifes . Anytime you go the Fiesta Henderson  be prepared to be ignored by the host especially the 3 main casino host,  IGNORE should be the first names of John Bennett, Jane Quine and Kyle Nelson. Really they treat guest like crap as if they are not good enough to speak to , yes they will walk right by look at you and not say a word or nod their head nothing! All of  my  friends and I are avoiding this place now since we do not feel welcome ever only ignored. Plus my senior friends do not own a computer ,so I told them I would update  the review for us . We all will not be back until the 3 unsociable, unfriendly host are gone. Richard if you read this please just watch  the host to see why the casino is going downhill, and really see where the problem is coming from."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my stay with my son. It was clean and except for casino cigarette smoke it was great"}
{"text":"This is for the hotel only.  My only experience with the casino was walking through it and it looked like most other casinos.

I booked two hotel rooms via Priceline a month before my stay for myself, my brother and his teenage daughter.  Via Priceline, I requested a 2-star hotel (think Super 8 or Rodeway Inn) for $35.00/night and was pleased when I was upgraded to a 2 1/2 star hotel, the Fiesta Henderson Station.  I didn't have previous experience with a Station hotel, but my brother has stayed in several Station hotels in the Vegas area and said his previous experiences were uniformly good.  Not this time. 

Two weeks before our stay, I called the hotel to request adjoining rooms, at least one with two beds for my brother and niece.  The woman on the phone was not very helpful, saying we should call Priceline.  I told her Priceline policy was to deal with the hotel directly, something I've done many times in the past.  She went ahead and took my request, but said she couldn't guarantee that my request would be fulfilled.  I figured two weeks should have been ample time to work my simple request into their system.  

We arrived on a Monday evening in mid-June for a two night stay.  The parking lot was maybe 25% full and the casino was not crowded, yet when we got to the front desk, we were told that not only could we not have adjoining rooms, we couldn't even have rooms on the same floor because \"We're sold out tonight.\"  This was a blatant lie - there were not enough people in the corridors or on the elevator or cars in the parking lot for them to be sold out.  We had to wonder what they would have told a family with small children.  The desk clerk's attitude, while not rude, was definitely unhelpful and unapologetic.  It was quite obvious that he dealt with angry, frustrated or disappointed customers often because of the hotel's crappy customer service policies (as I saw during another exchange with another guest the next day.)  In addition, the hotel required a credit card authorization of $100 for incindentals, not just a card on file, tying up $100 in your account.

The room, while not dirty, was on the shabby side.  It was a \"smoking optional\" room (I was told there were no non-smoking rooms available.) and smelled of cigarettes (as did the corridor.)  The air conditioner was very noisy  - and because it's Vegas in the summer, had to run continuously.  The furniture, while serviceable, was scuffed and beat up and one of the lights didn't work.  The tub was a jacuzzi tub, but when it was turned on, foul-smelling water came through the jets, indicating it hadn't been cleaned or maintained and probably wasn't sanitary.  

Finally, on check-out, we were assessed a $10.00 plus tax \"service fee\" for use of the hotel's services.  When my brother questioned the fee, he was told it was for use of the hotel's services, such as Wi-Fi, even though neither of us used anything other than the TV - not the phone, not the Wi-Fi, not the premium movie channels, nothing.  This was not disclosed at check-in and to my mind is blatant theft.  These fees should be included in the initial rates or disclosed at check-in.

To be fair, the hotel wasn't all bad.  Except for the front desk people, who were not very polite or helpful, the rest of the staff seemed pretty nice.  We had breakfast at the buffet and the food was decent and the price ($5.99) was fair.  (They offer a $2.00 discount if you join the Players Club, but it wasn't worth the hassle, since we knew we'd never stay there again.)  Everything worked, but it was outdated and   not well maintained.  My biggest complaints are with the poor attitude of the desk staff, the low priority of their customer service policies and the policy on incindentals.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went to the buffet, some lizard's tail fell of from the ceiling and was straight down hitting the table. Thought it was so disgusting. The food at the buffet are gross, definitely should be lower than one star. Over all hotel is alright, so 2 stars is the best it deserves."}
{"text":"The newest Fiesta property, since this was formerly the Reserve casino (fun jungle theme). A smaller property in Henderson, located right off the 95 freeway
but then again, there are not many large casinos on this side of town with the exception of Sunset Station and Green Valley Ranch casino. 

Here's a list of Pros:
-least smoky in henderson because the smaller ones nearby are very old, in comparison

-newer garage on the side of the casino- lots of parking now 

-movie theater, nice addition to the property- pretty big, too

-cafe is pretty good, but better than the buffet, which is alright (it's better for brunch)

If you want something better, I'd recommend driving to the M Resort, a large, but beautiful property with a better buffet, floral-scented lobby, and a reasonable gelato place."}
{"text":"It's an ok casino.  However it is not on the strip, so it will be quieter. Generally will see more locals than tourists here.  Always have seen friendly staff, and food has been good."}
{"text":"I made a hotel reservation online at Fiesta Henderson and within minutes cancelled. The AC went out at my home and I figured they wouldn't be able to fix it until Monday (this is on Saturday night). The AC repair folks texted me late that night (just after making the hotel reservation) stating they would be at my house early the following day. So I cancelled my reservation.

Fiesta still charged me 129.90 as a non-refundable deposit. I cancelled within MINUTES. I'm a local. This is how you treat locals? Of the four people I've spoken with at Station Casinos only one person wanted to hear me out.

I find this experience to be very disappointing and probably will avoid all Station Casinos moving forward."}
{"text":"This is the worst hotel/casino I've ever stayed.  First of all the bed was really uncomfortable.  Second, there was no hot water at 3am.  Third, the food was nasty.  Lastly, the front desk girls need lessons in customer service.  There were two of them, a long haired blonde and a lady in her late 50's,  helping one person.  Really...one of them should have let the people in line know what is going on...was she training?  We'll never know.  Then the blonde helped someone who skipped to the front with not an explanation why.  I will NEVER go to this place again.  The front desk needs lessons in customer service.  The only good thing is Starbucks...heads up to ya'll!!"}
{"text":"Over all the food is crap. 
They don't have a lot of food. 
The food is cold and not the best taste. 
The chefs don't do much because I came and had no egg rolls left and still no egg rolls. So over all I did not like the place and don't reccomend it 
The Rio buffet Is much better."}
{"text":"I have stayed here many times over the years, however I think I'm finished.  The hotel is decently priced and in good condition, and the casino is good and has a couple nice restaurants.  However the last three times I had stayed there, I have not been able to get a good night sleep for various reasons.  The time before last there was a sports team from out of town staying on my same floor, and there were kids running around the early hours a morning including small unattended children screaming.  Even that would not be a dealbreaker, because we all know kids will be kids. However the final straw was this past New Year's eve week when I stayed here from the 30th to the 1st.  I was awakened at 8 o'clock in the morning on New Year's Eve day by the sound of a very loud power drill in the room right next door.  Turns out there was a plumber over there snaking out a drain line.  I was not mad at him, he was just doing his job. However I was mad at whoever sent him over there at 8 o'clock in the morning on a holiday week.  As a business owner, I get very busy with my company and like to sleep in a little bit when I'm out of town. This was not to be. So I think next time I will stay elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is worst then Arizona Charlies on Boulder Hwy when it comes to there caf√© The host and food servers are beyond rude, 
Do your self a favor and stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a -10000000000. They only allow two dogs in their hotel which I have, and I have a third dog who is a service dog. She told me hey couldn't give me a room because two dogs was their max. I told her my service dog doesn't count. She didn't seem to understand that a service dog has access to everywhere and anywhere. I told her I had never had a problem in any other hotel. She proceeded to tell me to go to another hotel and then hang up on me. What a nice way for this hotel to treat someone."}
{"text":"Is this the swankiest joint in Las Vegas? No way, but this place does a great job catering to locals, they have great deals, and everyday low prices. The casino is fairly large and doesn't feel cramped. it can get rather smoky at night. But if you are in the neighborhood,  stop in and check it out. What can it hurt? Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"The cocktail waitress for high limits was much less than nice. I'm sure she feels entitled, but was rude and judgmental. She also argued with me about what section I was in . Mind you I'd been in high limits for an hour and a half , with no service. So . Might I add I hit a taxable earlier that day before her shift. Then I order food from the all night cafe, and the guy was AWFUL!! The black jack dealer was snappy and short, mind you my first time at a table, so I was willing to take a little heckling but she was rude. Other than that I won , the rooms were decent. And overall I was with a very large group of people. They were alright to stay with. However the staff is kinda bad, with the exception of the Coco Lounge bartender, she was awesome....so after posting, another rude encounter by the help in the cafe . Pull it together Jerks, it's called service industry for a reason, and you're not good at it."}
{"text":"I walked in to a breath of fresh air. This casino smells so much better than it's perfumed/smoke clouded sister casino Sunset Station. There were plenty of cocktail waitresses for refreshments while gambling, and their theater was exceptionally clean. The parking garage was very convenient for movie goers as well."}
{"text":"Again, expectations. If you go to the Fiesta expecting the Winn or Aria you will be disappointed. The Fiesta is an off strip property so if your intention is to party on the strip this will not be a good choice as you will have about a 20 minute commute depending on traffic. I like it for a locals casino. The buffet is decent and value priced. The property is clean and the staff is overall friendly. We have had a lucky streak lately which probably accounts for a star. We avoided the place for a long time but alas couldn't resist the free food, match play and free bingo."}
{"text":"What can I say? I'm cheap!

All at the last minute I decided I wanted to do a Staycation on Memorial Day Weekend in Las Vegas. Good luck finding anything, let alone anything for a decent price the day before the weekend right? In comes... Fiesta Henderson!

With a room, and two movie tickets, and two passes to the buffet for $119.95 my husband and I were off to our cheap-o hotel fun time. 

Sure the casino isn't great. The movie theater is, well, a movie theater, and the buffet, eh, the buffet - eh. 

BUT - you can't beat the price, even if the room was less than spectacular, but at least it was clean!

The pool too, was clean, and quiet, save for a few kids in the pool - and, sigh, no bar. But hey, my husband and I just brought champagne and chilled it in our ice bucket in the room, and a 6-pack of beer! We snuck our drinks into the pool hidden in normal old cups, and guess what? No one noticed. 

Disappointments - the lights in our room were very touchy, and randomly went on and off. And - no room service, so no breakfast in bed! *womp womp*

Pros - Great package deal and great discount for military. 

If you want to do it on the cheap, here's the place to do it!"}
{"text":"Buffet is good. Theater has shows all day for $6"}
{"text":"Ok so this is a 2 star casino with a lot of 5 star hospitality. 

The good stuff:
It's quiet, clean, and inexpensive. 

The bad stuff:
It's old, plain, and in need of serious upgrades. Our room was decent but the ac unit sounded like a freight train when it popped on.  

The \"whatever\" stuff:
There's some decent places to eat, a movie theater, and this place can serve as a retirement home. Or maybe it is already a retirement home because there's tons of oldies here."}
{"text":"Went last night to check out the Greg Peterson Band.  After starting 10 minutes late they were asked by Fiesta personnel to take a brake about 9:25.  The finally started up again about 9:45."}
{"text":"People are over here complaining about every little thing like they're rating a 5 star hotel or had to pay 5 star prices for that matter! This place was a definite last minute steal for us! We were originally planning to stay in Vegas on or near the strip that night, but visiting with our cousin&family who stayed in Henderson (down the street) making it very convenient for us to drive up the road and stay here. It was about 30 bucks (including tax) so definitely cheap. We got there a bit late (almost midnight) but it was clean and decent. The showers were nice and we definitely had a good night's rest before making our trip to St. George 2 hrs away the next day. While walking the casino, I saw that they had a few fast food stations, a Starbucks (BIG plus), a movie theater, their buffet/BINGO was located upstairs and I thought that was pretty cool to include all the extras. I loved it! Would def stay here again if visiting. =)"}
{"text":"The Fiesta Henderson is not a bad hotel, but its not a great hotel, either. The rooms are reasonably priced, and decently appointed. They are located a little far from the casino itself, however.

Room service was crappy, and it took forever to arrive. The bar downstairs in the casino, however, had $2 Coronas, and that was quite awesome. Also, the little Chinese diner type place next to the bar provided some seriously good grub at a good price."}
{"text":"This is a great casino. The casinos on the strip are pretty, glitzy and what makes it Vegas, but the casinos off the strip are just as great. In terms of payouts, I'd spend my money here on the slots than on a casino on the strip. 

The staff here are nice, and even though I was visiting, I was still able to sign up and obtain a club card to accrue points, and I even got a few bucks for the slots just for signing up.

The slots here range from really new games to some slots that seems to have been out for a while. There was a genie (as in magic carpets, lanterns, etc.) slot that I really enjoyed, and had a lot of free spins/extra games. 

This isn't the Wynn, so don't expect the Wynn. It's a fun, friendly and casual/affordable spot (and yes, there is a Subway and Fatburger in the gaming area)! I don't drink alcohol, and thankfully there was a Starbucks so I could fill up on some iced tea. Relax, and just enjoy your time here!"}
{"text":"BINGO BINGO BINGO!!!!! I love this station casino for the buffet and the ALL paper BINGO! I like the fact they have 2 non smoking sessions and there are no bingo machines. I have won bingo more times here than any other place in town. And of course between my bingo sessions I swing by the feast buffet which is directly next to the bingo room for some great food. I usually have the Mongolian grill cook me up something tasty and I always leave them a tip for doing so (please remember to tip the grill and your server. They deserve it)."}
{"text":"The worst experience EVER! Mostly the staff at the hotel were really rude - the exceptions were Kathryn at the front desk, Sarah in security and a nice bartender named Kevin. 
Rude bartenders and rude management! Not only that, someone called my room at 7am posing as the general manager of Fiesta asking for my credit card info... Found out later it was a scam and my card had 2 unauthorized charges listed as \"inmate payments\" of approximately $400 total.  The manager was very indifferent when I reported it to the front desk and basically said he couldn't do anything about it- I would have to contact security. I asked him if he could have security send someone to talk with us- he did but reluctantly.
If I could give 0 stars I would - the rooms were old and dingy with absolutely NO amenities. 
Terrible - I do not recommend this place to anyone!!! There are nicer places that know what true customer service is- go there instead."}
{"text":"Great location
Easy freeway access
Great restaurants - reasonable priced, well prepared, nice selection 
Weekend - live music in lounge
Why only 4 of 5 stars?  It is a bit dated and the mattresses need to be replaced they are quite worn. And the rooms are not really sound proof, you can hear converstions from the hallway as well as the TV and conversations from the room next door. Usually that isn't a big deal, but when the TV goes on at 2:30 am and stays on until 5:30 am and the people are talking over the sound of the TV then it's a big deal. So if your plan is to stay out all night you shouldn't have any problems at all."}
{"text":"Stayed here for my cousins wedding since it was 5 mins away from the chruch.  Overall the casion is huge, the overall place doesnt smell of smoke too much which is nice.  The staff is nice and answered every question I had.  I personally didnt have too much luck with the slots, however my family did pretty good espeically with the video poker.  One thing I really liked about this hotel was the food selection, they had soo much plus they had a movie theater inside which was pretty cool as well.  The one thing that really turned me off is when I was in my hotel room I saw a bug, and it wasnt just a spider it was huge, although I was super scared I think I killed it.  Throughout the night I couldnt sleep that well cause I kept thinking about the bug.  Anywho overall stay was good besides the bug problem I would say if you want a cheap hotel, away from the busy strip I would stay here! Oh another plus they have $1 margertias everday!!!"}
{"text":"I have stayed here a few times, the most recent being in May of this year. 

The Fiesta is a very nice, large hotel. They have a TON of slots and tables, a good assortment of restaurants, as well as tons of shops. 

We checked into the hotel early afternoon, then hit one of the restaurants. We had an event to go to in the early evening, so we had some spare time to play a few slots. Upon our return to the hotel, we ate at the burger place, which was pretty delicious. Then we continued our gambling, into the early morning. Before we knew it, it was almost 3 am, which is when we decided to hit the hay. 

We ended up not loosing too much, but still had a ton of fun. 

The beds were very comfy, and the room was clean. I would defiantly stay here again."}
{"text":"Surprised to such a low rating. We've been here at least 30 times. Not once had we had a bad experience. Last visit we a couple employees go out if there way for us so we decided to post a good review. Food, stay and gaming had always been good. Our service was exceptional yesterday. Thank you"}
{"text":"We checked in and then promptly checked back out. Our room was booked on the 10th floor. When walking down the hall to our room I noted that the carpets were dirty and there were groups of rowdy people even though it was 11:30 pm. However, the deal breaker was when I pulled back the blankets and there was blood and an old urine stain on the mattress pad. Nasty."}
{"text":"Ok, so do not eat the buffet here.  Yes it is cheap and somewhat nice, but your stomach will hurt for the rest of the evening.  I came here just for a cheap buffet, so it is my mistake.  i should know better.  This is like most of the other casino/hotels off of the strip.  Lots of smoke, lots of locals, lots of old people (no offense).  The best part about going here was it was the first time I played bingo in a casino.  It was $6 for 6 sheets, and the prizes were between  $50-$150 a game.  Not bad.  It was my fianc√©'s first time playing Bingo ever, which shocked me.  I had fun, but did not win a thing.  Lots of smokers here too, be aware."}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  I will never ever ever come back.  Room is like a motel 6: cramp crowded and no AC.  No hot water.  Staff is unhelpful.  The only manager available is a gaming table manager.  Also the room is so smokey it was like smoking a pack a night. Our eyes were burning."}
{"text":"If your a local, this may be a okay place to chill. If your in town on business and just need a clean cheap place to crash, this is great. If you are in town on holiday or anything of the likes, do NOT stay here. Its just not a vegas experience at all. 

I come into town every week on business, I just get here at night, sleep and get up the next morning and head out for work again. Works great for that."}
{"text":"The parking, customer service on checkin, and room were excellent for the price. There's nothing fancy, but for $19.99, it's a steal. Everything is clean, in decent repair, and recently remodeled. The pool was OK, but was a bit dirty, and there didn't seem to be any staff on hand to maintain or clean it. 

The big problem here is the food. The buffet is AWFUL. Even my 3 year old thought so - she normally devours everything we put in front of her, but touched nothing here except her apple (the one item on the buffet not prepared by Fiesta Henderson staff). My wife liked the Macaroni and Cheese, but changed her mind after they replaced the batch and it started to taste like soap. We watched another patron politely inform a member of the staff that they had mislabeled an item with shrimp as being pork, and listened to the chief get extremely defensive and literally start yelling at the customer. There is \"full service\"; our \"service\" consisted of a very angry man who seemed quite upset when we asked for chocolate milk for our daughter; \"No, we have REGULAR milk!\". He then got our drinks, and never stopped at the table or refilled anything after. My daughter was thirsty; it was odd telling her she had to wait until we got back to the hotel room for a drink of water. Meanwhile, I was scratching my head, trying to figure out why the \"international\" section of the buffet consisted of crawfish, chili mac, and cornbread, and yams (and no, they didn't mix it up with the American section). 

I had several concerns about the sanitation and temperature of the food there, too. Several items I tried to sample were so old and dry they were nearly inedible. Many items were never replaced, checked, or measured for temperature, as far as I could tell. I have no idea of their standards or the laws here, so I can't accuse them of doing anything illegal, but their negligence ceraintly showed in the abysmal quality of the food. We were there on a slow Monday night, and other reviewers have said the buffet was 'great', so maybe they only bring out their \"A\" game on certain days.

We did breakfast at the Fiesta Cafe and it was slightly better. To her credit, the waitress even went the 'extra mile' to create a glass of my daughter's chocolate milk (an apparently tall and difficult order at the Fiesta), though we had to tell her the 'recipe'. The rest of breakfast was decent and acceptable for a budget, short order breakfast, slightly redeeming the Fiesta food experience. If you have to eat at the Fiesta, go to the Cafe.

You might think that the \"great hotel, horrible food\" means you should stay here and just eat elsewhere. The problem is, this hotel is so far (20+ minutes) from the main part of Las Vegas, and going to any of the more well known buffets or food options is impractical. 

Bottom line: spend the $20 more to upgrade to a substantially better experience on the strip, and spend the money on an infinitely better buffet."}

Neither Booking.com or Fiesta Henderson will take responsibility for this, both are worthless and don't care about their customers--stay away!!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews but after the experience I had this past weekend thought I should share. The Fiesta used to be nice and we loved the buffet so over the years we have had many get togethers there. The past three times we've been to the buffet we've noticed some of the employees can be quite rude and the food has honestly gotten bad. This last time was the worst most of the food looked old and dried out but we made the best of it and tried picking out food that didn't look as bad. I'm not sure if they got new management or they've just lowered thier standards. Within a short time after leaving the Fiesta we were all sick and it ruined the rest of our weekend!! Blah!!! Needless to say we won't be going back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great locals casino. Staff are polite and friendly. The dealers are entertaining and make the table games even more enjoyable. The table mins are low. The weekend band is excellent and is free to watch. Has a movie theatre that is kept reasonably clean, average theatre quality. Diner and buffet food is acceptable and very inexpensive. Incredible value.

Decor 2/5
Staff 5/5
Value 5/5"}
{"text":"I love the buffet here! Much better than sunset station! I live down the rd from sunset but come to fiesta instead. Salad bar is legit! Lots of options, something for everyone. It is not a fancy buffet like on the strip, so don't go into it with those expectations and enjoy it for what it is: a feast of decent food at a reasonable price.  It is similar in quality/environment to a Golden Corral type buffet."}
{"text":"So, this hotel is located in what seems like the edge of nowhere. It is literally where the 215 ends. There is not alot to do near the hotel, unless you are into rock collecting. There is a brand new Target up the street. We wandered out to the Water District area of Henderson which should be renamed the Water Street Ghetto District for the tattooed and toothless. Ghettoriffic!

The hotel was OK. It is very basic and mostly clean. The pool is small and nothing special. They were full for the 4th of July and ran out of bed pillows...long story and I will spare you all the details of my phone conversation with the Hotel manager who eventually, personally, unearthed the last pillow in the hotel for me. 

The buffet was decent, and for the $7.99 ($6.99 if you join the slot club) price quite a good deal. As a hotel guest you get to stand in the VIP line and avoid the wait, which can be pretty long.

Overall, if you must stay in Henderson and don't want to pay the higher rates at the Green Valley or Marriott, I guess the Fiesta will do."}
{"text":"This review is for the casino only. I have never stayed here in the hotel.  

My bf and I live in GV/Whitney Ranch Henderson area so this place is farther than Sunset Station but decided to ck out the TCU game here this past weekend. @ Fiesta casinos its $1/beer $1/dogs so.. yeah its a no brainer if you're there to watch the football games. 

Last time we came here it was only bud and Budlight but this time it was Bud, budlight lime, and Michelob Ultra. Hell yeah. .. 

The waitress in the sportsbook hooked us up, no problems. but since all the tables were full we walked over to one of the bar areas near the \"tables\". this batrender (female) cards me. I was like what the hell? I didnt even order anything AND i was already drinking. How are you going to card me if I didtn ask you for a drink and I have one in hand. Being that I'm 30 yrs old pushing 31 in 2 months - I'll take that as a compliment with that glass half full attitude. But it pissed me off. I was like I'm not ordering anything from this chick much less tipping her. 
I was out.

We went bk to the sports book and listened to this guy talking mad trash about all TEXAS teams. I'm from TEXAS so this was hours of fun pissing him off since TCU won over Wisconsin. Haha! he never said he hated TCU, but ALL TEXAS TEAMS in general. thats pretty broad and pretty fun since in TX Football is a religion. loser. but we met some very nice bartenders at the other bar who nicely gave me some tomato juice for my beer which is oh so delicious but also enabled me to drink way more than I anticipated doing that night. But it was so much fun. We met some other locals who werent TX fans either but they were nice and was glad I dont live in CA anymore b/c people are much nicer here than in San Diego. 
I'd def. come back here to hang with the locals. 
notice i said drink... not eat. 
see review of Amigo's ....."}
{"text":"Busy locals Hotel/casino on Lake Mead Bl. in Henderson, motorcycle ride close to both the Lake, River and Valley of Fire State Park.  Hotel rooms are a bit worn out and need a redo.  They do have LCD TV's but they are on stands and not comfortable to watch while you're in bed. The accoutrements and bathrooms have the bare basic essentials.  Nothing to write home about.  

Casino is just OK. Good video poker but for craps players, there's only one dice table. This is NOT a destination location for out-of-towners."}
{"text":"This place certainly isn't fancy and I think you'll realize that without reading this review.  But, the people are friendly, and it has a couple of amenities worth mentioning that make it a very solid, and affordable, place to stay in Henderson.  The first is the movie theatre.  It's located near the food court, and away from the majority of the casino.  Additionally, it is close to the entrance near the sportsbook, so you don't have to walk through a ton of smoke to get to the entrance.  I'm not saying you won't experience smoke at all, but it's certainly a much shorter walk from the parking lot to the theatre than you experience at a lot of locals casinos.

The second amenity specifically worth mentioning is Fuego steakhouse.  This place is a FANTASTIC value.  Great old school dining room, excellent service, and the prices are great.  I had a better ribeye here for $34 than I've had at fancy joints on the strip for $20 more.  If you are a beef person and stay at the Fiesta, a dinner at Fuego is a must.  

For a much cheaper price than a lot of its competitors, you can get a clean hotel, near the highway, with a decent sized casino and above average steakhouse.  That's a pretty solid proposition if you ask me."}
{"text":"Stayed here for one nigh when traveling to Northern Cal. The 39 dollar room they advertised turned into a 49 dollar room. They said they were sold out of the $39.00 room so I paid the 49 bucks and went up to my room and logged into their site. 

  There web site said the $39.00 rooms still available. I was just too tired to go down and argue with the clerk.
 So my advice is have your smart phone cued up to there reservation page so when they try and duke you like they did me you will have proof of then miss leading you.

 

  Feasta Henderson you guys duked me and got away with it."}
{"text":"I had a really good time at this casino. I think that it is very very nice. The only negatives that I found with it are number one, they need a much better gift shop, there's really nothing to choose from in the little gift shop. Secondly, they need to remodel the rooms and the hallways. The hallways are very dingy and the doors look like they've been through a war. Thirdly, it would be cool if they have microwaves and refrigerators in the rooms. It would come in very handy, especially when you're staying for 5 days like we did. Lastly, our room was quite noisy. It was surprising because our room was at the very very end of the hall, the very last room. But as it turns out, there is a laundry room right next to our room, and so the maids were going in and out of there all day and all night and it was very very loud and obnoxious.  So I think they should move their laundry rooms to the way other end of the hall, down by the elevators. It's not fair for those of us that have the corner rooms at the very very end of the hall to have to listen to  the laundry carts coming in and out of a room next to us all day and night. Other than that, we really like this place, it was very nice, everything was there that you needed, and they have a very nice theater here too."}
{"text":"I booked here for a quick two night vacation to visit my son in Vegas.  This has been our long time go-to place for the buffet, so I figured what the hell?  I booked Sunday and Monday nights.

Check in was a breeze.  The lady that helped me was very night and checked us right in and sent us on our way.

The room is pretty basic.  Web got a non-smoking two queen bed room.  My husband and I slept in one bed, and my daughter slept in the other bed.  It was cozy.  The room over all was what we needed.  The amenities are very basic in the bathroom, but we always bring out own stuff anyway.  They did have a blow dryer.

We went to the movie theater, which we have been to a couple of times before.  My first question for them was weather we would be able to bring Starbucks in to the movies since they are literally next door.  They said sure!  That was awesome!  I also paid for our movies, and then realized I forgot to show my military ID.  I went back to the counter, and they were more than happy to refund me my discount.  I thought that was very nice of them.

Later that night we sat at the casino bar and played some games.  The two bartenders that served us were both great.  They had awesome senses of humor, and kept the drinks coming.  In several instances, we didn't even have to ask.  I played Caveman Keno, and my husband played Blackjack.  My daughter and I also took a little break and got food from the food court.  She had the pizza place, and I had Fatburger.  Both were awesome!  All in all it was fun!

We didn't end up staying the second night  because something came up, so we checked out and left.  We didn't even make it to the buffet! haha!  I would definitely stay here again.  The rate is very reasonable, as is the resort fee."}
{"text":"Price is great, love the fact kids and dogs are welcomed.  I do not like the buffet serving the same thing daily.  I love the ice cream machine with toppings.  Staff is great, clean, and relaxing."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place many times but finally decided to stop by and see what it was like inside.  Good parking, and (still) free.  Not terribly smoky inside like some other locals' casinos.  Good video poker pay tables and surprisingly good selection of both video poker and slot machines.  The only hangup is that my comp offers come from their chief locals competitor so it is doubtful I'll be spending a lot of time here.  Kind of too bad."}
{"text":"The food and service was great! I'd come back again for the bread rolls and the steak. I was in town for business and I had my mom with me along the trip. The manager Michael was professional and personable and our female server (sorry, I don't remember her name but it was unique and she had been there for more than 10 years) checked on us during each course. Our busser made sure our glasses were not empty and cleared any dishes we were through with. The booth we sat in was comfortable and could easily accommodate even more. Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"My friend finally graduated from training at work today, so we wanted to celebrate with a coupld of drinks tonight.  Somewhere REALLY close to our house and somewhere REALLY cheap, so we found ourselves at the Fiesta.  

The special the run on Fridays are as follows: A beer and a shot for $4.00.  A shot alone is $6.00 so you get a lot more for less. Our bartender's name was Craig. For the price we paid, it was well worth it.  I got drunk and didn't have to worry about breaking the bank.  It's one of the best in old Henderson. Smells like smoke, but with those prices, it's ok.  

CLEARLY, I have nothing else to say about that.  We got drunk.  We had a good time and we will be back."}
{"text":"BED BUGS!!!!! STAY CLEAR OF THIS PLACE!!
The customer service is terrible! Yelp should have a negitive review option because this place would win a solid -5 stars for their management alone. 
We were out for a family member who was passing. While we were dealing with that my son called me and says he saw a bug on the bed. I told him to send me a picture and it's a BED BUG! (Pictures attached) 
I immediately called the hotel staff and they sent security and housekeeping who took pictures of now a second bug and confirmed that they were BED BUGS. They transfered us to another room, which mind you was a down grade with the smell of cigarette smoke from the bathrooms and all. 
I asked if there was BED BUGS wouldn't we just be transferring the bugs to the new room? The Hotel Manager, Patrick did not seem to care and said it's never happened before. They further stated that they are going to have a company come and check \"free of charge\" as if it was my responsibility to cover the cost of THEIR problem. 
I asked if the new room was checked and he couldn't give a straight answer. I later found out that it was not as housekeeping came up to the room 4 hours later.
Housekeeping told me at that time the \"professional company\" would not even come to check the room or my belongings until the next day at around 4pm....CHECK OUT IS 12??? Now thats convenient....
We had to leave so when we checked out I asked to speak to someone regarding the horrific event and was told the Hotel manager Patrick would be in by 1pm and the Director of Hotel Operations, Kristin, did not work weekends. I left messages for both everyday and did not get a call back for 2 days. (By the way I still was REQUIRED to pay full price for these rooms)
When Patrick finally called he told me that he had good news and there are no bed bugs.....WHAT??? I have pictures AND your security has pictures with a report.....you moved  our rooms because it was CONFIRMED??!!!??He further told me AGAIN that this was free of charge as if that was our compensation for dealing with this...
WHAT A JOKE!!!
SO, if you are looking for a hotel that doesn't care about your well being and you could bring home BED BUGS by all means come stay here at the Fiesta in Henderson.
Just as a side note do your research on how NOT to take these bugs home with you..I had to through away my luggage just to be sure because the hotel obviously didn't care."}
{"text":"Wow 3 times my iron didn't work found hair on my bed and the room was outdated it needs remodeling and also when I took a shower in the morning the water wasn't hot and barley was warm wow no hot water are you serious?,
Your a hotel all guest should have access to hot water this is unfair fix your plumbing problems and make it fair for us to enjoy our stay so we can return each time but by not taken care of us and not making us happy. won't make us return, we spend thousands and get nothing in return please remodel all your rooms and fix your hot water issues and please put new beds and matresses, thank you hope this review gets to the owner."}
{"text":"I stayed here based on the positive reviews and wasn't disappointed. It is a good place to stay overall. The food at the amigos cafe was excellent. The buffet was... A buffet. Lots of food for cheap. The rooms are adequate, but cause I didn't book far enough in advance, I feel like this trip I overpaid for the room. 

I'm not a big fan of casinos, and this one, like many others I have visited, took my money happily while giving minor amounts of satisfaction."}
{"text":"Tried several times to call and make a reservation without any luck. I was put on hold several times and hung up on. They will not learn my business. No wonder they have a two and a half star"}
{"text":"If I could do negative stars I would. This hotel is disgusting. If you start by saying a hotel is clean, let that be a warning. Aren't they supposed to be? The rooms smell like smoke. Even the non smoking rooms. The wallpaper is peeling off the walls. The room stinks of the deodorizer they use to attempt to cover up the smoke. The TV isn't connected and doesn't work. The previous guest apparently was generous enough to leave their food behind. I can't believe that this hotel was this bad. I arrived at 2:00 in the morning and was forced to stay the night. At least they had A/C in the room. Too bad it sounds like a train! I found another hotel and left ASAP to check in a few miles away. Run, don't walk away from this hotel. It's cheap for a reason!!!"}
{"text":"The guy who checked me in seemed like he wasn't too happy to be there, not friendly at all. The room itself was ok. Clean for the most part and the bed was comfortable."}
{"text":"Hahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa This hotel was like a bad Seinfeld episode. 

Mind you I am a the stereotypical New York type Jew, therefore, walking into a hotel/casino that seemed to house the American Hick convention, i already felt really out of place. Toothless wonders zombie-ishly playing slot machines for all eternity, the buffet lines of the same people who kept getting bigger as hours passed..

I had to stay here because I was going to see Vegoose (music festival) and I chose this place due to convenience and location. It is by NO means a nice hotel, though this wasn't what I was expecting. 

There is a pretty large casino though, randomly with a fast food court and movie theatre. It is 20 mins from the strip in a car though, and walking around the hotel at night gave me the heeby geebies. I would never stay here again. oh HELL no."}
{"text":"Had fun here! Sports bar is amazing if Rob is there!!!! Comfy rooms and great drinks!"}
{"text":"We stayed here last week because they are a pet friendly hotel. Honestly I should have looked elsewhere. The rooms were dirty, as the maids couldn't be bothered to lift the bed skirts to vacuum underneath the bed. We found a huge earring, dust galore, and what looked to be 5 month old cheetos. We have 2 cats and a small child, the room's uncleanliness was unacceptable. The A/C units were extremely loud and not running as they should, because the room never got that cool.They did not have comment cards in the comment card envelopes so we could not leave a review.

The buffet was lackluster at best. While it was cheap, the quality of food reflected it. I wasn't really satisfied with anything I ate that night, and could definitely tell that most of the food was pre-processed food that I could buy myself at the store.

I give this place 2 stars and not one because the staff was very very friendly. Also, The cafe was great for breakfast in the morning. My veggie omelet was great."}
{"text":"Went to the Regal theater and it was very nice. I like they had new chairs. They were comfortable.  Easy to get around."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on my way out to go ATVing in the desert because I knew casino's usually keep their bathrooms nice and clean.  I also stopped here because we had some time to kill so I sat at their $3 BJ table and played for a good half hour and I even won $55 bucks!  This was a good \"pit stop\" for me!"}
{"text":"Won't go back to stay at this one. Asked for non-smoking room and immediately smelled the smoke in the room upon opening the door. Checked out and went to another hotel. Rooms need an update too.

If going to enjoy the amenities offered within the hotel well worth it but highly discourage staying at the hotel."}
{"text":"I have been going to fiesta to cash my check for 6 years now.. I went on 12-05-15 to the cage to cash my check.  I was called up by Bob. I said hello for him to just look at me... Don't know what is wrong with him but, working in customer service aren't you supposed to be friendly?? Maybe, Bob needs to go behind in the back where he doesn't have to deal with customers..  I worked on the strip for 7 years and, never did I lose my customer service skills!! Bob your attitude sucks!! Horrible and rude!!"}
{"text":"The room I got was comfortable enough and had the basic amenities that one might look for in a decent hotel. My only complaints were:

1. The carpeting of the room wasn't the cleanest. After walking around barefoot for a short while, the soles of my feet were rather dirty.

2. Entrace to the guest rooms requires a bit of a trek to the back of the casino, and it took me a few trips in and out to not get lost.

Otherwise, I had a nice 2-night stay. There was a lot of construction in the parking lot, but it looks they are expanding. There's easy access to  Lake Mead Parkway, there are plenty of stores and restaurants not too far away. There's also complimentary coffee in the room, which actually wasn't as bad as I expected."}
{"text":"We booked our stay online for King bedrooms when we got there they had given them to someone else the lady at the front desk was very rude we then went down the next morning and fixed it later the next evening my husband went to gamble and was yelled at by an employee the only good thing I would say about the hotel is the late night cafe is very cheap for ok food bad service and we ate at the stake house it was outstanding all the way around the pillows and shower heads where terrible in the rooms"}
{"text":"The restaurants have horrible service and sometimes the food isn't much better. It's funny. I win at other Station Casinos. And this one I don't. Seriously. Seems just a little strange. Plus, the drinks are half size compared to Sunset. And apparently you have to ask for a wine glass when you order wine. That's just tacky. Management needs to review all departments."}
{"text":"Ehh. the staff in the bingo room ALWAYS card my cousin Marissa and I... and we go ALL THE TIME! its so annoying. The Old people in the bingo room are RUDE! just becareful when you go there."}
{"text":"I only play pai gow and I didn't like the options for the bonuses. They don't have progressive bonus like all other station casinos and the regular fortune bonuses pay out less and the envy bonus is less also which didn't make sense I guess because you have a betting spot that you'll get pai gow and if you do it pays out x amount based on the type of pai gow you get. I really don't like betting that I'm gonna goer pai gow. It's a pretty big casino it's seems like Texas station which is a dive and palace station are the smallest casinos that station owns. 

Parking was easy and the ceilings are high so it's not too smokey. I think palace station is one of the worst for smoke."}
{"text":"I love the fiesta its my favorite place to play. I'm a local. I had a huge problem last night. While I was playing at a table my phone fell out of my pocket. I was devastated that I couldn't find it. No one had turned it in and when I tried calling... someone had shut it off. I spoke with security and they acted quickly. They recovered my phone from whoever had taken it. All the memories stored on my phone... all the information we keep on our phones... it could have been so much worse. But thanks to the fast acting security staff I am giving this review on my cell phone. I won't be going anywhere else. I am in awe at the quality of staff on fiestas security team! Marvelous job!"}
{"text":"Both Fuego steakhouse and amigos cantina give great service and good food.  Trying out all the station casinos accommodations and for 50 bucks a night it wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either.   The walls are thin so  be careful not to be too nosy but all in all... Great stay!"}
{"text":"Really simply, the Fiesta in Henderson is a great hotel. The staff is very friendly, and the floors are clean. 

The Rooms: The rooms are (surprise) basic hotel ammenitiy rooms.
There's a bed, TV, closet, Iron, etc. There's not a lot of fluff, but then for the price, what would you reasonably expect?

The Casino: The casino is clean, and there is (Even at 2am) always at least 1 person walking around and cleaning machines, and picking up after the people who cant be bothered.

The Buffet: (Full Disclosure - My Buffet was comped)
I had low expectations when I saw the buffet. I figured that it would be a basic run-of-the-mill-get-the-gamblers-fed-and-back-to-the-machines type. I walked and checked the buffet. Salad was crisp and clean, the veggies were vibrant and crisp. There are several stations of the buffet, the most popular being the Mongolian BBQ. There was a line 9 people long, just waiting for their food. I tried it, it was well cooked, and not overly sauced. The dessert section had the standard ice cream dispenser, pies, cakes, etc. What I didn't expect to see there was fruit. It was a nice change. Not just Watermelon, cantelope, and mystery melon. There was kiwi and pineapple, and more.

Overall:
If you look at the Fiesta as a 2 star hotel (one step above a Super 8), you will be pleasantly surprised. If you look at it from the standpoint of the MGM or Bellaggio, then I fear you will be severely disappointed. 

The staff is very freindly, and the food worth coming back to, both in quality and price.
The rooms and Casino are clean. What more can you expect?"}
{"text":"We got an awesome deal through Hotels.com for a room . The staff is courteous and friendly at every bar, the buffet and the hotel registration desk. The room was clean and stayed comfortable throughout the night! The A/C was not noisy it did have an interesting fan noise every so often but it was not loud. The buffet has many choices and for 9 bucks you cannot get good mongolian grill anywhere else! The 99 cent margaritas were a good after-spicy-dinner drink! Everyone should try this place!! The only bad thing is the smoke however its not as thick as some of the other casinos!"}
{"text":"Love coming back to play and eat !! Bingo is our favorite! Good food great movie theater! Cater to Vets and Sr folks!  We enjoy coming every chance we can!"}
{"text":"Went to the cafe this morning as i didnt feel like paying starbucks $2.30 for a sml reg coffee to take to my coffeeless room iv'e been staying in for a week, as i was by myself they asked if i wanted to sit at the snack bar, at 9am i didnt feel like sitting in an uncomfortable seat at bar, asked for a booth since i saw at least eight available and was told i would have to wait 10-15  minutes!  ...., old trick to get u to gamble while u wait, i wet and complained to front desk who called mgr eventually se young girl showed up and stated that they had had a large party?  and led me back to restaurant and snack bar after i had already explained situation to her... she went in back with the hostess who i spoke with earlier. Having lost my appetite and now extremely upset having been discriminated against for being a single woman... I left.  Shall no longer stay here or use their restaurant, it wasn't very good anyhow."}
{"text":"This place is THE PITS!  Stayed here on the way back to CA after visiting UT.  Avoid at all costs.  Perfume smell in the hallways, terrible buffet (even at half price), non-smoking room had so much air freshener it almost made my wife sick.  Look around.  Any place would be better."}
{"text":"If he worst hotel I have been in but still left disappointed. The rooms are almost as interesting as watching professional darts. The front desk lady Erin was a rude woman of the dark ages. I was supposed to have a king size bed but they ran out. They claim it is all sold out but the parking lot is empty and so is the casino. It is fucking Wednesday!! I don't believe you that there is Not another room available. If you want shitty service with underwhelming rooms stay at Hooters. If you want something that is worse stay at Fiesta Henderson."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I hadn't been to the buffet here for several months. It has gone down hill so much I doubt that I'll be back again anytime soon. It used to be a really good buffet, but not any more. The new ownership has taken this once good buffet to the outhouse.  I guess that I'll have to find someplace else to eat on Thanksgiving if I am in town.

The food selection has diminished and was mediocre at best. The cutting board was terrible and the sausage was unedible! Someone should tell them that the garlic mashed potatoes are actually supposed to be mashed. I have to say that the brussel sprouts (yes, I love them) were actually cooked just right. 

Once they had what I thought was the best desert island of any locals casino in the area, NOT NOW! The selection is poor and the once to die for sticky buns are GONE! WTF Stations?

The service was good but I hate eating when a lot of the tables around me are still full of dirty dishes !"}
{"text":"I have stayed at this hotel several times.  It really needs an update, the carpet is old so it looks dirty even though it may be cleaned.  The decor is out of date and some of their appliance look like they are on their last leg.  This place is really cheap so that is why we stay here but if they would update the look they will probably have more business that come. One thing I do like about staying here is there are side walks so I can go for a run down the long street that parallels the hotel and cross by shops and other businesses."}
{"text":"The Buffet is priced cheap and there is an ok variety of foods, but none of them are edible unless you are going to starve to death before you can get to a McDonalds. Lived in Vegas 20 years, traveled everywhere and like all kinds of food. This was a quick decision to try the buffet before we drove on to Arizona. Bad decision."}
{"text":"This update is long overdue...

This place was not nice to begin with, but has steadily gone further downhill since my last review.

We used to go here for bingo, because it's all paper.  We now choose to play elsewhere.  I can get more packs at another small casino and spend less money.  Not sure how that works.  Also, the staff is pretty rough around the edges and I find a few of them to be quite unprofessional while calling.

Next, I am still angry that they closed their poker room.  It's been replaced by some BS slot tournament area.  It wasn't the busiest poker room I've seen, but there was a steady group of regulars and the tournaments were fun.  Closing this room was pretty much the beginning of the end for me gambling at Fiesta.

Can they figure out the cafe situation? It went from the cafe to Denny's back to the cafe.  None of which are anything worth mentioning.  Fuego is the only place worth eating at, but not worth going out of my way for.

The hotel rooms are absolutely disgusting.  Old, smelly and in need of a major remodel.  I don't care what they charge, they need a major overhaul.

It's sad to see, because it's not far from my house and I would love to spend my hard earned money there.  But that's just not happening."}
{"text":"Really people? 1 or 2. This is the friendliest and most helpful place I've been to in Henderson. It's a local casino and have one of the best buffet around except Green Valley Ranch. I never stayed at the hotel since my parents in law live in Henderson but we have friends that stayed there and they enjoyed it. I can't say anything about the showers and hot water but maybe u were just in bad luck that day. I love the environment plus it's easy to find parking. They got parkings outside the casino and a 3 floor parking house."}
{"text":"We stayed here for one night on our way through Nevada. It was not the cleanest hotel, and the walls are paper thin!!! After checking in and checking out the casino, we drove 20 minutes to the strip- we both agreed we wishes we had stayed right on the strip! Returning back to fiesta was hard, and we realized how smokey and stinky it was.... The buffet was good tho, everything & really cheap $9.72 each for brunch & dinner with players card."}
{"text":"On April 23, 2012 we decided to take my daughter here for her 12th birthday.. Big mistake!!!! I still can't stop thinking about how horrible it was. We got there about 6:30 pm... Getting in was ok but if you have more then two people they put you aside and take care of smaller groups first.. The wait was ok but I heard other parties complaining that night about being set aside.. I do have to say our server was awesome .. Thanks RYAN .. However!!!! , the food was HoRRIBLE.. gross, Yuck .. There was no fish.. Except crawfish which you could tell nobody was touching..  Most of it was cold or like the turkey was dry .. I'm so disappointed.. I usually don't write reviews but I thought what a waist of money on food that was so awful. Won't be back here again!!!"}
{"text":"Stayed here on a recent trip to Las Vegas from 11/15/2014 to 11/18/2014. You should be aware that this is a budget casino located in the suburbs and thus both the casino and the hotel won't be anything near what you'll find on the Strip, but I really enjoyed my stay here!

The hotel is located on the upper levels, and downstairs, there's practically everything you could ever need - a pool, a Subway, a Starbucks, even a 12-screen movie theater. The Festival Buffet is average quality, but good for the price. I don't gamble so I can't speak to the quality of the slot machines or games, but there was a large variety of gambling activities available in both smoking and non-smoking sections.

In terms of the actual hotel, overall, it was a great experience. I stayed in a king-sized suite for about $35 a night, and the room was nice and spacious. A few things could be improved, however:

1. The bathroom light seems to have a motion sensor, and thus, the light would go out while I was in the middle of the shower. This would happen about once every 10-15 minutes or so, and I'd literally have to step out of the shower soaking wet to turn the light back on.
2. As this is primarily a casino and secondarily a hotel (and a budget one at that), there were no toiletries available at the front desk as you would normally find in a traditional hotel. I forgot toothpaste at home and had to buy a new tube rather than take a free one from the reception desk as you would ordinarily do in a hotel. Shampoo, soap, and body lotion were provided, however.

Other than that, an excellent stay for the price. The Strip is only about 15-20 minutes away, and Hoover Dam/the Arizona border is about 30 minutes! Overall, excellent and convenient.

P.S. Try the banana nut French toast at the Fiesta Caf√©!"}
{"text":"I brought my family to the buffet because I had a large group and wanted them to have a variety to choose from. Stay away from guy at the Mongolian portion of the the buffet the two guys working that portion made all of my family members uncomfortable. When i went to get Mongolian for myself he mistreated me as well. Ignoring me, throwing food, making a joke with another employee that my food was gross and smelled. I asked him to get a supervisor for me and he ignored me again. So i asked another employee. I did speak with the supervisor Dan and he apologized and assured me he would speak with his employee. I will say my server did a great job! Because of him and the attentiveness of management i gave this place 2 stars. As for the food it was ok at best."}
{"text":"I called at 2:30 am to see if this was a pet friendly hotel. I was assured it was. I arrived for check in at 3:30am. I was then told that the only person working (one for the whole hotel) was on lunch break and not back for an hour. After waiting an hour we were told there are no pet rooms available. I then told him that I asked him at 2:30 if there were are any rooms. He then said he was the only person answering phone calls and he would never say  there were rooms when there weren't. He basically called me a liar and cast me away."}
{"text":"I have never stayed here before, but my best friend is a platinum player and got the room comped for me as I was passing through my home town of Henderson, on the way back to Denver and I was on a non existent travel budget. I gotta say, other than the crazy long wait at my midnight check-in, everything else was very pleasant!

The hotel is pet friendly, which I needed as I was traveling with 2 small dogs, they have bell service which was great because I had to unpack my entire car for this stay, the casino is steps away from the elevator, and there is tons of food options, a theater, and a bowling ally. 

Growing up, I had frequented the theater, buffet, and other food places quite often and I am so glad that as a guest I was treated well too!"}
{"text":"Thumbs down today,  bad service  and... Need to re look at how you treat customers... We come often and today treated very badly.   Get rid of young lady at bar  outside of fuegos.   She has  horrible customer service skills"}
{"text":"I came here from Reno for a competition when I got here I thought the outside looked very nice. When you first walk on it looks okay. But after getting to the elevator and in the room is where it all went down hill. As soon as you open the door you get a smell like a bad apple car air freshener. Which made me instantly feel sick to my stomach. (The smell is lingering too. I've been in here for over two hours and it still smells awful) the room had two queen beds that looked a little bent up. My beds blanket had a nice little white stain on the top so I quickly found a cleaner lady and got a new one. Then after that was done I decided to connect to the wifi that we played $11 per night for and when it asked my to enter my last name and room number it told me that it couldn't be found! So I called the front desk and asked what was happening. They had no idea. So after dealing with that I just decided to go get some food. They have some nice food selections down on the casino floor (like subway, fat burger, Starbucks, ect.) which is nice. But for paying almost $500 for four days in this place it's really not worth it. It would be nicer and cheaper to just stay at a holiday inn."}
{"text":"The Festival Buffet used to be our \"go to\" buffet. In the past nearly 3 years since we have returned to Henderson, the buffet has gone down hill. 

First, the desert island was banished. A special section for \"Chairman\" account holders was installed.

On the food: the oriental counter has very little selection, the same can be said for the Italian and Mexican counters. On the Italian section, only the pizza remains a constant.

On the bakery: the best ever sticky rolls are GONE. The rest of the bakery items are good, but just try to find butter. I had to ask to find butter, it is relegated to the 'condiment island' - no cut up sticks (hard frozen and impossible to spread). Where are the individual cups with a selection: whipped, margarine, real butter?

On the Roast Beef: Like many of the advertised Roast Beef on billboards and TV, the puny cuts given are a far cry from those pictured to lure you in...

We go to the buffet when we get FREE offers, but no when we have to pay full price!"}
{"text":"I stayed here 2 nights while visiting family.  

The negatives:  The lobby / casino area was SUPER smoky, not a chance of getting out of there (even if just for a meal at one of the restaurants) without smelling like an ashtray.  In desperate need of a new ventilation system &/or designated smoking areas.   Also, the heating / cooling in my room was so wacky... it was either hot & stuffy or freezing & windy (yes, windy in the room).  Speaking of the room... no coffee pot, no mini fridge or microwave.  My first night's stay I got in late so the only thing open was the caf√©... so I grabbed us a pizza assuming we could eat leftovers later, but no way to warm it up.  The restaurants... no matter if they were busy or not, they still make you wait at least 10-15 min for a table (assuming it's because they want you to gamble, which I don't)... so that was annoying.

The positives:  the people were all pretty friendly wherever we went (front desk, caf√©, restaurants), and we were always greeted by housekeeping / maintenance staff in elevators or in halls.  The pool area was nice but false advertising (in multiple areas) of availability of poolside dining (delivery).  The pool itself was a bit colder than most, but being from Michigan, I'm used to that & actually appreciated the refreshing dip.  A 10+ screen movie theatre in the hotel!"}
{"text":"Cool casino and sports gambling lounge. Also had a vegan burger at fat burger. Really good"}
{"text":"Staying here for the four day weekend. I didn't expect to get a smoking room when I booked a non smoking because I don't want to wake up smelling like ashtray. Instead, they told me Orbitz gave my assigned room and the Hotel is fully booked. So can I be refunded for my unpleasant night and start this over once I get a non smoking room?! 
I guess I'll find out in a few here. Overall, this hotel is not bad. They just need to work on giving the customer an update prior to checking in or do it's best not to give my assigned room to another customer..okay!"}
{"text":"I used to come here to gamble on their slots and have some luck.  Lately,  I've had no luck at all, so, not going to give them my business anymore.  It's a shame because I live nearby, but, got tired of walking out a loser every time."}
{"text":"Based off the reviews, I really thought that I was going to be stepping into a run-down Motel 6 with muddy carpets and broken slot machines. Boy what a pleasant surprise Fiesta turned out to be.

First off, you'll be hard pressed to find a cheaper spot in Henderson.  By now you should already be expecting that dreaded $9.99 resort fee.  On the plus side, for $30 bucks you get wifi that's good enough to stream non-HD videos (~1Mb/sec).  Internet...check.

On the way up, you'll pass by a decent-sized casino area with a movie theater and eateries like Dennys, Fatburger, and Subway.  Being this far from the strip, It's good to know at least I won't starve to death.  Late night grub...check.

I was here on business, however, so I skipped the casino.  I've got a sensitive nose so a non-smoking room was a must.  I am pleased to announce that even with my hound-like schnoz, the hallway passed the sniffer test with flying colors.  Allergies...check.

Step inside the room and you have, well, your basic room, which looked lifted out of the early 2000's.  Your basic amenities: one CRT TV roughly 27\", 2-3 lamps that provided ample lighting, closet, and a restroom.  The beds were made, the restroom was nicer than I had pictured and came with a blow dryer and towels, and the shower didn't get clogged.  Above all, the room was clean.  Functionality...check.

My one complaint: the damn climate control.  It took me a minute or two of fiddling with the high tech central a/c remote before I realized that it wasn't hooked up.  In lieu of it, I discovered a retro wall-mount unit that did the job, perhaps a little too well.  I feel really bad for whoever has to sleep directly next to the blower.  A/C...meh.

So at the end of my stay, my overall impression of Fiesta is a positive one.  It provides excellent bang-for-the-buck, not nearly as ghetto as princess-types make it out to be, and seriously, was anybody really expecting the Cosmo?  Hell, you even get this thing called a \"news paper\" dropped off at your doorstep every morning.  I have yet to figure out what that is, but rumor has it that old timers enjoy doing crossword puzzles on them.

Great value, check."}
{"text":"My corporate HQ booked a room for over night business trip. This was bad news from jump. The hotel entrance was behind the building and not well marked. Check in was a disaster. Between the resort fee, security deposit and incidental deposit the room was an additional $165 they wanted to charge to my personal card. I refused to pay for it and started to walk out. They quickly waved all but the resort fee which was billed to the corporate account. I should have kept walking. I was to have a non smoking room with a king size bed. The elevator, hallway and room smelled like an ashtray. I will agree never walk around barefoot in these rooms. The shower tub was straight out of a motel 6. It had a queen size bed that was short sheeted. It didn't have a fitted sheet. The foot of the bed wasn't covered with a sheet so my feet were on the mattress cover. Just nasty. I slept diagonally to keep my feet off the mattress. Next morning I checked out without exploring anything else there. I had our corporate travel planner put this dive on the banned list and would suggest that everyone else do the same."}
{"text":"My mother stayed here recently. It was the only Hotel/Casino with vacancy during the dates she needed amd near by my residences. The room was noisy during her nights. There were loud generator a few floors just bellow here window on roof tops near the building she stayed in. Her room shared a locked door with the room next to her (adjoining rooms) we could hear the man caughing for hours and descriptive sounds. The large crack that outlined this door would shine a bright light in her room during the evening hours as she tried to sleep. 
If the person had tgeir lights on
We mentioned the noise and the gal ar the reservations counter didnt seem to have any care that she didn't have a good visit. 
One star. Tjeybhad a great casino and some good service. However the 3 night stay wasnt relaxing at all for my mother. 
I wouldn't recommend this Casino unless you are a very heavy sleeper as noise and bright lights wouldn't wake you"}
{"text":"If I could give  0 stars to this place, I would. After all the money my boyfriend and I spent here over several months on food, drinks and gambling, we were treated like sh*t  tonight . After having a nice dinner at Festival buffet as always, I was gambling on one of my favorite machines when this older security guard Bryan  came up to me to ask for my ID ( I am 37 years old  ). I showed him my valid ID issued by the Republic of San Marino ( I'm a visitor) and he said that he could not  accept it because he doesn't know what country it is. . It is not the first time I am asked for my ID  in Las Vegas while gambling or buying alcohol,  and it has been accepted everywhere from Miami to Los Angeles ( believe me guys you are the not the only ones who ask me for my ID and I am more than happy and proud to show it). He started  to question me as if he was a cop or detective, making me personal questions like  with whom I was and when I said that I was with my boyfriend, who was talking on the phone at that moment in the lobby, he started to question that too,  as if I was a liar or a scam artist. He asked me to leave in a very rude way. I went to the security booth and asked for the Supervisor . One of the guards told me: Do you even have a passport? That is unacceptable after I showed him my ID and my International drivers license. 

The worst part of all that is that the Supervisor never showed up. Worst customer service ever! My boyfriend, who is a public figure , will also share our experience here with thousands of his  followers on Yelp, trip advisor and Facebook."}
{"text":"First of all I knew I wasn't going to a five star hotel or anything but this place was ridiculous. On my second night there my son found a cockroach in the bathroom and when my husband informed the manager of the incident all he stated was \"well what would you like me to do?\" As a manager of a business myself I felt that this response was a little on the unprofessional side. The manager did immediately place us in a room 4 levels up and waived our $10 fees for  each night we stayed. I felt like there was more that could have been done but that's not for me to say."}
{"text":"Was just discriminated against by a cocktail server and Pit Boss for being Homosexual. I'm so upset by this situation as a Boarding Pass holder, and Henderson local."}
{"text":"Totally got bedbug bites from sleeping in my hotel room bed. How fucking terrible. 

Casino doesnt have a poker room.

ATM costs like 3.75 to pull money out.

Place is pretty terrible."}
