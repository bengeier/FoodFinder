{"text":"The food here is amazing, I love that there was a variety of food so my friends and I were all satisfied. What I loved about this place is the karaoke, something which other bars don't offer. If you are looking for a good night with your friends and  some good food, at an affordable price then Poco Loco's is the place to be. I will definitely be going back!! P.S. potato skins here are to die for!!"}
{"text":"We've just tried Loco's once...so far.  It's nothing fancy, but we found it comfortable and unpretentious.  Seemed like a friendly crowd. There are TV's for sports and VLT's.  . We tried the pizza, Hawaiian with cashews and it was delicous!  Nice crust, not too thick but not a thin crust either, just the perfect amount of crispy. Lots of sauce...yummy!  We also ordered lasagne. Served with Ceasar salad and garlic toast too it's great value for the $$. Lasagne was only $10!  The Ceasar salad was so tasty, it had bacon!!! The service seemed a little slow at first, I think there was just one person serving the floor and the bar.  She was very nice, and I'd have to say she did a great job.  She came back to check about our food and drinks and was totally accomodating when we wanted to take our left overs home. We will try Loco's again for sure.  It's in the Entertainment book too!!"}
{"text":"Went in on a decently busy Thursday night. Unfortunately took a relatively long time to get noticed by our server, even longer to get the drink to our table. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Always a blast with the Karaoke here! However, Friday was the first time I actually ate at Poco's. We had a Spinach Pie and Butcher Shop pizza. What I liked most about the pies were how clean they were. Much less greasier than I expected! It was a little more watery than I was used to, but it didn't bother me that much. I also thought it was a little overpriced. $18 dollars each for a small 10' is an excessive premium, but I would eat here again.   Interesting Fact: Poco's has WiFi, neat!    Every time I come to Poco's I have a good time, will be back when I have stress to release!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for lunch for years and although I'm sure I've tried several items on the menu once I had a Calzone here I was hooked!  Best Calzones in the city by far! At a more than fair price at $11.00 you pick 3 toppings from a variety of toppings from the pizza menu and you get a monster golden crusted folded pizza baked to perfection.  All I can say is its a Calgary must try for anyone that enjoys a Calzone.  They remind me of the old n famous Mothers Pizza calzones if you ever had the pleasure."}
{"text":"Quite surprised at the food. We had everything from pizza to burgers to fish and everything was so good. Went in the afternoon so was nice and quiet. Everything about our dining experience was positive. Would totally visit again."}
{"text":"Between Angelo finding his true love, only to have her pass out later in the middle of the floor... the scary giant guy singing \"Part of Your World\" from the Little Mermaid (which I'm now convinced is what you hear when you die) and the woman that came prepared with a pre-mixed CD for the karaoke emcee; \"interesting\" doesn't quite describe this place.   Next time, bring travel-sized Purell."}
{"text":"Where's the service?  I was hungry on Wednesday night and looking for some late night pizza pie, so I went to Poco Locos around 930.  I could see the pizza.  I was salivating.  After waiting for what seemed like two minutes nobody had come to take my order so I walked out and went to the pizza place across the street.  If I could give zero stars I would have."}
{"text":"I think Poco's has one of the best english song karaoke selection in the city. In fact I'll go as far as to say it beats any $400 set of magic sing mics! Unfortunately Poco doesn't have private rooms :S Leaving exposure to the heat of a dive bar joint. Decent beer/drink prices, although last night we went there was only one waitress who was serving the entire place, making her visits to your table very rare.  When one visits a dive bar and observes and comments on the characters that they see this place, one makes an assumption that such \"shady\" characters frequent this place. Perhaps this is half true, but I sometimes like to consider how they have observed me and if they in turn found me a befitting dive-bar character.  Last night I shook hands with a friendly but strange fella newly arrived from North Africa ,who I assume realized that this was not the place to absorb Canadian culture and quickly disappeared.  One piece of advise: when singing karaoke at dives, ALWAYS deploy the use of a hypeman. Preferably one that is carrying some HEAT."}
{"text":"I've been in the restaurant. It was pretty good. This review is for their by the slice counter.  I had left Taste of Calgary unsatisfied appetite wise and needed a bit of a fill up. Decided to head over to Poco's and grab a slice. I am not huge pizza fan to begin with but I do like the pizza at Poco's.  The guy that I ordered the pizza from mentioned that he thought the pizza wasn't warm enough. He took it into the kitchen and nuked it for me. I headed outside and sat on the curb. The guy inside came out shortly after and offered me a stool.  I spent the next ten minutes think about how awesome the server was. Much love!"}
{"text":"I came here with Team Fam and I ordered a Chicken Thai Pizza (peanut sauce, roast chicken, onions, peanuts, cheddar). This was an individual-sized pizza that could be shared as an appy for 4 guests. This was an okay pizza. I didn't taste much of the peanut sauce and the peanuts appeared to be non-existent in the mix. However this did have the chicken, onion, and cheddar as advertised. Compared to say, Village Pizzeria though, the Harrison Hot Springs spicy Thai trumps the one found here."}
{"text":"What DT pizza place you know in Calgary that's got their own parking? 7 spots ;)  Plus a patio too.  Everything's all fresh, so even if you place advanced order, they only make the dough on that day; nothing's pre-made, pre packaged like Subway lol."}
{"text":"*dive bar alert* And yes I'm giving it 4 stars. Why? Because you'll get an experience at Poco Loco's like nowhere else in the city. Not even Ducky's.  Besides having ridiculously good pizza, Poco's is host to karaoke night. I'm not sure if they're still doing it 7 nights a week, but it's definitely still there on the weekends. Now, if you hit the night right (which we seem to, so I'm inclined to think every night is the right night), you'll pretty much have the place to yourself save for a couple of the regulars. So there's no need to be shy around the karaoke machine.  The other bit you'll get at Poco Loco's is the experience of Dr. Love who appears to have taken over hosting the karaoke. We once did a duet together. That was something.  Though there's a decent selection of songs in the book, I don't think the karaoke book has been updated in quite some time, so don't expect some of the more recent hits to be in there."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot if you want some steak and fries for lunch!  $6.50 if you get a drink with lunch!  Dirt cheap.  It wasn't particularly excellent or anything, but it was solid.  Steak was flavored well, but a bit tough.  I asked to upgrade my fries to poutine for a couple dollars extra, which was the right choice.  They've got a great little outdoor patio area too if you want to enjoy the sun some.    I will say though they seem a bit understaffed.  There's a pretty good lunch crowd, but only the bartender seemed to be going around waiting and busing all the tables.  At the start of my meal she came by quite a bit, but as it got busier, I had to go inside to flag her down."}
