{"text":"Excellent Chaat Papri and Bhel Puri. Very authentic street food. Definitely be back. Sparse on the inside but the fun is to stand on the street and eat."}
{"text":"Ok place. They claim they are best reciewed on trip advisor, but i dont see why. 
The shop looks run down. 
They do not make anything fresh, everything from peas to masala is from box or packet. They simply mix stuff up, charge 500% more and sell it. 
I dont think i can say with confidence that i will return here again."}
{"text":"I ate Overpriced Pani Puri which tasted ok. The boiled potato seemed to be stale. One should ask the price first and then only eat because prices vary from person to person. you can also bargain."}
