{"text":"Hi my girlfriend and I just visited the Montreal and we ran into a Cambodian restaurant. Being both first generation Americans of Cambodian parents, we have very high standards for the food. We're happy to say we both enjoyed our dishes: the Prohkat and the Amok. I'd would say the Amok is better than when my mother makes it. We're definitely coming back when we're in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Très décevant ...  La viande était sèche ... Je ne recommanderai pas ce restaurant.  Nous étions trois et nous n'avons pas été emballé ..."}
{"text":"The food was great!  We chose to split a combo, which saved us a bit compared to ordering the dishes separately.  The food was cooked perfectly, and the portions were generous.  The staff was very friendly, and the location is very convenient..  I highly recommend trying the pumpkin corn dessert and the fish entree."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite meal on my trip to Montreal. Amazing food, a taste of Cambodia. Touring the neighborhood, we decided to try a different cuisine of food, since there are barely any Cambodian restaurants in New York. The decor is magnificent, quite beautiful. The menu was very complex, with numerous Cambodian specialties, bits of Asian fusion incorporated. There was one guy who waited all of the tables, which at most on a Monday night, was 10 tables. Plus, he managed the register, delivering the orders to the chefs, and pouring the wine. Plus, he is really friendly and social in both French and English. The variety of food is extraordinary. So are the prices. Very reasonable, entrees ranging from $10-20. We started off with the fish cakes over crunchy noodles. The fish cakes had slight spice, the perfect temperature and perfect heat for an enjoyable appetizer. They looked amazing and had great consistency. They tasted so good!! Served with a cucumber sauce, very mild. For the main courses, we got Thai glass noodles with beef, the birds nest with chicken, and a chicken with peanut sauce. The Thai glass noodles had great flavor. The noodles were so skinny and when you picked them up, so many came out. That was the only negative thing I could say. They are easy to separate because they were cooked properly. The beef was very tender and added flare to this perfect dish. Served with vegetables as well. A birds nest is crispy, skinny noodles handcrafted into a bowl shape, filled with your choice of protein. We got it with chicken and vegetables. The chicken was amazing. The vegetables weren't overcooked, very delicious. The beauty about the birds nest is how the noodles start to cook when sauce is applied. So towards the end of the meal, the noodles went from crunchy to smooth. The chicken with peanut sauce was the most creative meal. They consider the sauce to be peanut butter, but it's just peanut sauce. The peanut sauce had so much flavor, with so much expertise in making it. The chicken was really good. Served with steamed rice, which was great. Also served with spinach, but it must have been dried, since it became crunchy. Really awkward taste, but really good. No too much salt. A perfect meal and I will come back."}
{"text":"I was really, really excited when I found out we finally had some Cambodian food in Montreal-- I hadn't had a good bowl of amok or Cambodian dumplings since my trip there this past winter. I knew we were in trouble when I opened the menu and spotted various generic Thai and Chinese dishes on the menu with a smattering of actual Cambodia dishes.   We split three appetizers; the wontons, the  fish cakes and the five-spice dumplings... all mehs.   The amok was delicious and the fish expertly prepared, but it was nothing like any of the other amoks I'd eaten in Cambodia (of which there were many in and around Siem Reap). Saucy, and heaped with veggies and meat is what it's supposed to be-- I got what appeared to be fish braised in a lemongrass-heavy red curry and a whispy iceberg lettuce salad on the side to serve as veggies.  Perhaps this is regional variation specific to the owner's area of Phnom Penn?   We finished off with the pumpkin and corn hot tapioca pudding-- which turned out to be more like a hot and sweet soup, instead of the thick, warm, creamy pudding I expected. Again, maybe regional differences.   I probably won't return here just because I can get most of the menu at other restos for quite a bit cheaper and with more on the plate.  Also, beware-- this place has been advertised as a BYOB, but they no longer do this.   My search for good Southeast Asian continues..."}
{"text":"Was visiting Montreal and wanted to try something different, nice decor, very friendly and attentive staff. We ordered a few things to try out and the they were all great, especially loved the soup (don't remember the name). It was later in the afternoon, so not too busy and the owner came out and chatted for a bit. We are definitely going back on our next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant . Service fast and friendly. I was accompanying a friend for a snack and I indulged in the mango salad which was delicious. I look forward to sampling more from the interesting menu on my next visit"}
{"text":"We search for Cambodian restaurant in Montreal and found this place. The decor has some Cambodian paintings and arts mixed with nonCambodian. This place has great reviews on Yelp and Urbanspoon but I guessed I expected too much and hoped it would more authentic Cambodian dishes. I spoke Khmer to the waiter and he brought out another menu on a piece of paper with several Cambodian dishes.   We ordered papaya salad (Bok lahong), fish cakes (prik thit trey), tom yum soup, lemongrass chicken (cha kreung sakmourn), and beef salad (lok lak). Overall, the dishes were a bit on the sweet side and real Cambodian food aren't sweet but more of bold robust flavors.  The tom yum soup was sweet and has some curry flavor to it rather that sour, spicy, and boldness from galangal, chili, and lemongrass. Papaya salad was a major disappointment. It was soft, mushy, and lacking the authenticity of real Cambodian flavor. The portion is very small for each dishes. The fish cake were small, dried, and chewy.   Overall, it's a good place for other ethics to experience Cambodian dishes but don't expect too much for authenticity."}
{"text":"Dinner here was delicious! I can't think of any complaints with regards to the food. The flavors were well balanced and the ingredients were fresh.   The staff were generally very attentive and helpful. They were a little slow to bring us our menus once we sat down, but afterwards everything ran smoothly. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was drawn in my the lunch specials and I wasn't disappointed. Great value for the price! The decor is very pretty too. The food itself (at least what we sampled for lunch) wasn't extraordinary, but it was very satisfying. I had a red curry and it was exactly what I expected. The fun thing about the lunch special is that all the components come out at once on a large plate. No waiting for you to finish the app to bring out the main, its all there, artistically arranged. I like it!    It's bring your own wine, so I'll definitely keep it in mind for a casual dinner out with friends."}
{"text":"This excellent restaurant in the Plateau fills a real need in a town that doesn't have much great Thai/Cambodian food. I've been twice in one month and had great meals each time. I'm vegetarian, and there are many tasty tofu options in addition to the usual meat dishes. Also not to be missed are the salad rolls with mango and the mango salad. The service is friendly and quick, and it has a very relaxed atmosphere. There is a good lunch deal, but dinner is also reasonably priced--dishes run in the $12-15 dollar range."}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian options, and they are pretty good. The $18 dinner includes a soul, appetizer and entree. I loved the spring roll with mango and the lemongrass/peanut tofu entree. Very friendly staff. The portions could have been a bit bigger, for my taste."}
{"text":"Cute little place in the plateau with good food and friendly service.  I started with the chicken tom yum soup and fish cakes as appetizers.  For the main dishes, I had the caramelized braised pork with bamboo and my boyfriend got the red curry with chicken.  Our waiter informed us that on Tuesdays the desserts are included with the meal so we tried the fried banana and pumpkin corn pudding.  Everything we ordered was delicious but the only thing I would suggest is to maybe order an extra side of rice as our dishes were missing just a bit of rice to finish our meals.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went there with friends but were deeply disappointed with the service as there was only one floor staff for many quests. they should have hired more people for a saturday night."}
{"text":"I like the Kreoung with chicken. It wasn't as authentic and robust, but was aromatic and the lemongrass was so delicious. It tasted like a curry dish but with fragrant spices. Eggrolls were decent and fresh. Would return to try the Amok."}
{"text":"I went here for a family meal and really enjoyed my introduction to Cambodian cuisine...it reminds me of a cross between Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai. My sister and I shared a variety of appetizers: mini imperial rolls, fried wontons, and fishcakes, as well as a mango salad and tofu summer - which was a cold soft tofu dish with a soy-based dressing. We also shared a fried ice cream for dessert and a pumpkin and corn tapioca pudding. Maybe we went a little heavy with the fried items but they were all light and relatively not greasy. I can't always handle spicy food, but if my stomach is up to it, next time I'll try the fish amok, it looked really delicious! The desserts aren't overly sweet so if you like that, then you might enjoy something a little different like their tapioca."}
{"text":"We were 4 on a week night supper. we ordered drinks and supper. One waiter was alone and overwhelmed. The food was average in taste. Nothing outstanding. Portions were ok but nothing great. The decor was alright. For a local place, it was ok but we came from across town looking for something special. To top it off, the waiter overcharged us two drinks. He gave us the bill without the detailed slip. It was after we paid we asked to see the details. Maybe a oversight. I'll let you decide. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Nous arrivons vers 21h dans ce restaurant Cambodgien, et c'est vide. Nous auront ce soir le privilège d'avoir un serveur exclusivement dévoué, à nous! Je dois dire qu'il était aux petits soins, très aimable, nous n'avons manqué de rien et le service était impeccable. Là s'arrêttent les points positifs. J'ai commandé une soupe wonton, et un poulet à la citronnelle. Le bouillon de la soupe était plutôt correct, mais les wonton n'avait absolument aucun gout. Quand au poulet à la citronnelle, il était sec. Je m'attendais à voir arriver un plat en sauce, mais non. Le poulet (visiblement lui était mariné à la citronnelle) était posé tel quel sur les nouilles de riz trop cuites, et sans gout, sans saveur et même pas salées. (cela dit, la présentation était pas mal) J'ai gouté le poulet General Tao que mon copain avait commandé, il était pas si pire mais encore une fois, il manquait de saveur, j'en ai mangé des bien meilleurs ailleurs."}
{"text":"I don't have too much experience of Cambodian cuisine so I can't say if it is authentic. But the amok fish here really impressed me! Will highly recommend it. Also they have very friendly staff. Definitely a good place to try new things."}
{"text":"Trop de sucre dans tout! Soupe sucrée, sauce aux arachides trop sucrée, salade de papaye verte sucrée,...Sans parler des ananas présents dans plusieurs recettes. Saveurs vraiment pas équilibrées. Personnellement, je préfère le sucre et les ananas dans les desserts."}
{"text":"Après mainte et mainte discussions avec mon amie passablement difficile côté nourriture, on a réussi à s'entendre sur ce restaurant pour célébrer notre anniversaire en commun avec un groupe de nos vieux amis d'enfance. Les prix sont abordables, le menu est clair, le service était acceptable, mais la nourriture.. J'ai vraiment été déçue. Ça faisait longtemps que j'avais envie d'un bon bol de tofu grillé à la citronnelle, c'est donc ce que j'ai commandé. Le tofu était mou, gluant à l'intérieur et sans saveur, et la citronnelle n'était pas sous forme de sauce mais plutôt comme une pâte recouvrant les poivrons, seuls légumes de l'assiette, qui agressait mes papilles gustatives tellement la saveur était concentrée. Mes convives ont également plusieurs commentaire décevants à faire au sujet de leur plat, mais je vais me garder une gêne, ça se résume pas mal tout à la même chose. Ah aussi, le vin goûtait la piquette. On a passé par dessus le dessert, qui avait l'air pourtant invitant à la lecture du menu. Mais vu l'état de nos entrées et des repas principaux, on a décidé d'investir notre argent dans une valeur plus sûre.  Je n'y retournerai pas, et j'espère que vous allez vous diriger vers un des multiples restaurants de qualité avoisinant sur la rue Mont Royal et St-Denis. Mon 56$ pour 2 personnes, j'aurais fait mieux de le mettre dans 5 trios au A&W et nourrir tous mes amis du même coup, je pense."}
{"text":"A client suggested this as a good place to meet for a business lunch and I couldn't agree more. What a sweet find! On a Tuesday, it wasn't packed, which meant we could actually have a decent conversation without any distractions. Our server was as sweet as pie and very attentive - quite an adorable man with an obvious knowledge and passion for Cambodian cuisine.  Everything was very decently priced - I think my meal + coffee came out to about $13 and I was TOTALLY satisfied with my food.  Next time, I'll do a dinner date with my manfriend because our friendly server informed us that the dinner menu is where the real traditional Cambodian fare comes out! OH, I forgot to mention - they do takeout and delivery, too! Yay!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious dinner!  My husband ordered the dumplings and actually ordered another one after dinner because he loved them so much!  His dinner was what the waiter recommended - a traditional Cambodian dish with lemongrass, and he chose beef with it.  I had a tofu vegetable dish and it was fresh and delicious.  Beautiful restaurant with windows that opened to the outside, surrounded by planters with flowers.  If you're looking for great food with a nice atmosphere, this is a perfect place.  I would definitely eat there again.  The atmosphere did seem to lean towards intimate conversations and not a party of 12 being super-loud."}
{"text":"Très bon cambodgien.  Je n'y ai jamais mange sur place car le cadre ne m'attire pas su tout. Par contre je commande pour manger à la maison et je n'ai jamais été déçue. C'est très frais et typique. Je recommande pour la livraison!"}
{"text":"We tried the roasted quail and the seafood pot.  The quail was moist and the seafood pot was steaming hot and well balanced. I would highly recommend it.  All for less than 60 $"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times recently for lunch, and I really enjoyed it! It has a very relaxing atmosphere.  If you opt for the lunch special, the mango salad is fresh and tangy and the imperial rolls are nice. I enjoyed the peanut butter chicken served with sweet, crispy spinach.  The nid d'amour noodle dish has a fun presentation and a delicious sauce. My coworkers recommend Dad's favourite caramelized pork.   Once, we tried a dessert, a coconut rice pudding with palm fruits and fresh jackfruit. I'm really curious to try the pumpkin and corn pudding, but we'll have to go back sometime.  We had the same server both times, and he was extremely friendly and hilarious. He told us all about all of the different types of fruits and the more traditional dishes on the menu: kroeung, lok lak, and a pork stew. Next time!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night for dinner and was not disappointed with my experience.  Located a stone's throw away from Mont-Royal metro this restaurant has a somewhat upscale decor with Asian influence.  They focus on Cambodian cuisine and prices are incredibly reasonable.  Our server was friendly and welcoming.    Your best bet is to get the table d'hote which for $18 gets you your choice of soup, a spring roll or imperial roll and your choice of main dish from the menu.  I started off with the Phnom Penh soup which was a chicken rice soup.  They must have used lemongrass in it because it had a citrus flavour to it which I really enjoyed. The imperial roll was on par with what you would find in any Asian restaurant but the star of my meal was the quail.  Marinated in ginger, honey and garlic it was juicy and had that nice grilled taste to it.  The portion was a bit on the small side for me but I wasn't left hungry when I was done.  I just didn't feel very full.  Cocktails are cheap but the flipside to that is that they are quite weak.  I had the Petite Mangue which was vodka, mango juice and pineapple juice.  There was not much vodka in it at all as I tasted more of the juice than anything else.  Given how cheap the drink was ($6) I wouldn't object if they raised the price just a bit and made the drink a little stronger.  If you're looking for something different then come here for dinner.  For the prices they charge you just can't go wrong at La Petite Mangue."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Very cozy and welcoming . My partner and I had a bit of everything we tried the Citronelle fish soup and Tom Yum have to say both were delicious and I would definitely come back just for the soup I had perfect tangy and sweet flavour ! Next we shared the mango salad and Salmon tartare and if your a mango lover like us you will surely enjoy each pf these dishes, the fried quail egg on the tartare is a very nice touch. Lastly, we shared main courses with their specialty Amok fish cooked with coconut milk wich was filled with homy flavour if you've ever visited Cambodia :) and the grilled quail was perfectly crisp and very good in taste with the side sauce. All in all a very good experience. The restaurant was just a bit cold the night we went in winter so be sure to bring a sweater."}
{"text":"Moi et ma mère ont venu a Montréal pour la fin de semaine et voulais trouvé une place qui avais des option vegan pour diner. On a trouver ce restaurant et j'avais beaucoup d'options. Les serveurs étaient tellement jolie et la nourriture était délicieux. Je recommande fortement que vous visitez ce restaurant! :)"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing flavour profile. The staff are super nice and friendly . The chef is affectionately called the \"little chef\" but boy can she pack a punch of taste in her food."}
{"text":"Came here last night and had a really nice time. The menu is packed full of yummy sounding things and we were all really pleased with our meals (salt water spinach and tofu, chicken curry, beef satays, pork dumplings, etc.) The only unfortunate part of the night was they forgot my soup, boo, it sounded really yummy on paper.   Portions are a bit on the small side, but you won't leave hungry. Full bar menu and cheap food. The sticky rice could have been stickier, it was basically a small portion of fairly normal rice."}
