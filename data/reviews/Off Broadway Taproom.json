{"text":"Always stop here for lunch, tasty food and sometimes back for a beer late in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Rainy Sunday just after noon. Broad selection of draft beers. The wait staff was a little taxed but the second shift showed up right on time. 

Rosemary chicken panini: 3.5/5 maybe some garlic, good chips. 

Philly cheese steak: \"best one I've had in a long time\"

Farm fresh burger: \"two thumbs up, but a bit over cooked\". Tots were spot on. 

Tacos: carnitas, fish and crawfish. I'd give it a 4/5. Fish was only ok, carnitas has a great salsa, crawfish was good but would be better if blackened instead of fried. 

Glad to stop in for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great craft beers, food, and service!  We had the fish and carne tacos, out of this world!  Another bonus, must be 21, adult atmosphere.  Came on a recommendation and paid off. Don't judge the place by it looks from outside. Just a sign that says \"Coors\"."}
{"text":"Tim and I randomly stumbled upon this place after a hike at Clifty State Park at the beginning of August. We really needed something to eat (as well as a celebratory beer). This has become my favorite bar/restaurant in Madison. It's hip and young, but has great decor from its previous uses. We come here often because it's a great spot and there's always a friend hanging around.

Their beer selection is spot on and the food never disappoints (especially if you skip their beer cheese). They host local artists on the weekends too!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal meal. My girlfriend and I took a random trip to Madison for the state Park and the wineries, ate here on our first night. She got the California chicken panini, I got the tacos (one fish, one chicken, one pork). Our meals were excellent, though I liked the fish one so much I might get 2 of them next time. Good craft beer selection, great service (our waitress was also bartender and was just amazing), also great live music on a Wednesday night. Not too loud, not too soft, and great songs. All in all great experience, if I could give it more stars I would. Go there!!!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever. They refused to serve a sandwich without cheese or make any accommodations with allergies. The manager on duty was very rude and disrespectful. She was confrontational and yelled at us in front of all the other guests while stating she would not be in trouble because she has been there for three years. Extremely disrespectful and we will never be back."}
{"text":"Food = 4 (tacos were pretty good)
Price = 4 (special 2 buck beers were great)
Experience = 4 (best spot in Madison for beers and a little food) But, not that outstanding compared to outside of Madison)"}
{"text":"There is little to dislike about this small town tavern. The bartender/server was very nice and knowledgeable about the food and beverages.  She recommended just the right mix of food and drinks.  
We started with a raspberry beer, a red beer (tomato juice & beer), and a peach cider.  Followed that with a hummus platter with homemade hummus, crispy chips and veggies.  We finished with some carnitas tacos - slow roasted pork, pineapple salsa, cojita cheese, and pickled red onions on both flour and corn tortillas (gluten allergy!!) All were very tasty!! 
If you are traveling thru Madison IN and need a break from the road The Off Broadway Taproom is a nice stop."}
{"text":"Cool huge venue, great artwork in the bathroom, great food, great value, chill servers!

I stopped by for lunch halfway through a great motorcycle cruise down from Indy, I LOVED THIS PLACE. You get the legit old school bar feeling as if you were in an old saloon, walking past the long bar on the left. The food is a great value, I had a half pound bison cheeseburger, and could not be happier for the money.

Pro-Tip: Get the tots for an extra $1, freaking awesome tots, Napoleon Dynamite approved

Extra- Tip: Take a seat in the bathroom -- my favorite part of the decor was the caricature caricature paintings of musicians all over the bathroom walls!"}
{"text":"I would rate this a 3.5 if possible. A little above average but not quite a 4 for me. Fish taco and fries were definitely a 4 but I felt the beer selection was weak. Additionally the very first thing we tried to order, fried green tomatoes, was out.  Being this is a taproom, I thought they would have a better selection of draft beers. Oh well. Onward. 
The pretzel with cheese dip and spicy mustard was very good. I particularly liked the soft warm pretzel with the mustard. It went very well with my Bell's Two Hearted Ale. 
I also had a fish taco and carnitas taco. Both were tasty but I felt the pineapple added to the toppings on the carnitas taco was a bit overpowering. I took most the pineapple off once  I got a taste. However, the fish taco was outstanding. I particularly liked the subtle spicy heat and the textures with shredded cabbage in the toppings. 
My wife also had the carnitas taco. She wasn't impressed, but to be fair she's not a big meat eater. Ironically, she did like the pineapple on the carnitas. 
She also added a side of fries. The fries were the coated type and were very good. 
I would return for another fish taco and try some other menu offerings."}
{"text":"Nice bar with a great beer selection....friendly staff and owner...great tacos....didn't have a chance to check out the entertainment but hopefully will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Sunday and almost right when they opened. Ordered two Cokes, four tacos (two pork and two buffalo) and the pretzel bread with beer cheese/honey mustard.
The service was very good (we were one of two groups of customers). We had watered down pop and it was quickly replaced. A refill was given to us before we even got halfway through our drink.  
The pretzels were fantastic. They were soft, salty and the cheese was good. The cheese could have been heated up a bit though, as it was kind of lumpy. Honey mustard was good, but too mustardy and not honey enough for me. Hubs liked it though.
The tacos were on sale for $2 and they were pretty good. The buffalo taco had a celery bleu-cheese slaw on it with chicken on a flour taco. The pork ones were good with pickled red onion, white cheese and salsa verde. The pork was a tiny bit spicy for me, but I don't do spicy. 
The bill was about $21. 
Would eat here again."}
{"text":"Great beer selection for a small town bar.   Fish tacos on Tuesday are amazing and worth the trip.  Trivia on Wednesday.  Live music most nights.   It is a hopping place.  Food is decent.  Lots of bar stuff and fried food.   Tater tots for $2 are a great deal."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a nice bike ride. Took almost 20 minutes to be greeted by a server. We almost walked out. However, a server came to the rescue. Once we got our drinks, the service was better. I ordered the Rock n roll burger just for something different. It Had jalapeños and peanut butter on it. It was amazingly good. Wife's tacos with grilled chicken was excellent as well. Prices reasonable.  I would give a 4 Star if service had been earlier."}
{"text":"It had probably been four years since my last visit and a good judge of quality food is consistency.   The carnitas taco were just as wonderful as I remembered.   Pineapple salsa, cotija cheese and pickled onions on corn tortillas.   The carnita was shredded, the contrast of sweet pineapple, salty cotija and tangy onions really uses all of your tastebuds.  Good selection of draft beers.  If you're spending time in Madison- make this a stop."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome! A little noisy but great atmosphere and the burger and Philly cheesesteak are the bomb! Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"had the buffalo burger. it was pretty good. wife had the fish tacos. she seemed happy. good beer selection. good service. come on in.  

update: stopped in for a to go lunch order.  fish tacos were excellent. good wings. they have some new beers on tap. whats not to like!"}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing the bar since my husband and I didn't eat. The bar was great!! Wonderful, well rounded selection of craft beer and lively, knowledgeable staff! Great location. Will definitely come back when I'm back in Madison!"}
{"text":"Who'd a thunk jalapeño and peanut butter would go great together on a burger (Rock-n-Roll Burger)??  This place has friendly staff and some off the wall items and some great classics.  The beer selection is impressive as well."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are really good! Atmosphere is nice and staff is friendly. Nice place to stop by fora beer and a taco."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Had the California Sandwich and some wings and really enjoyed them. Bartender was friendly and checked in with us regularly. Definitely would recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Based on food reviews alone we came here. 
As soon as we sat at the bar I went to the restroom and came back to my boyfriend having a beer at the bar. It literally took 15 minutes of both female bartenders to wait on me, and they had to be flagged down by my boyfriend. Don't expect great service. We ordered the fish and chicken tacos which were incredible and completely not what you would expect from a pub bar. I felt underwhelmed by their selection of draft beer with having \"taproom\" in their name. They had a stage so I'm assuming it would have been a better time had their been music and better service."}
{"text":"Good draft selection and great tacos.
Perfect spot after a day of hiking. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"They have everything we look for in a bar: good selection of beers (draft and bottle) at great prices, a nice comfortable atmosphere, and great service. We couldn't have asked for anything more."}
{"text":"Nice place to stop in for a drink when browsing the shops in Downtown Madison. 
They had a decent craft beer list on draft, with surprisingly great prices! Lots of options under $5! 
They also have a full bar, and food. We didn't eat, but everything we saw coming out of the kitchen looked awesome. It's typical bar food (nachos, wings, etc.) plus tacos. The prices for the food looked reasonable as well. 
Service here was good, and the vibe was cool- casual but not divey. It was nice and open with plenty of natural light, and clean."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection.   Loaded tots are yummy.   The tacos were even better.   Wifey had the fried green tomato BLT.   Had a bite,  it was very good too.  Great atmosphere.  Highly recommended for beer lovers that want to eat."}
