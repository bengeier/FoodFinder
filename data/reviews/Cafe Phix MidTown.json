{"text":"My husband and I love this gem of a coffee house and visit each time we find ourselves in the area.  The owner is so friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"8 out of 9 people gave this place FIVE STARS - they deserve each one! My Latina Reading Group was suppose to meet at So Euclid Park, but it rained. I have never been to So Euclid, and had no idea where to reschedule at the very last minute. I read reviews, and VIOLA - I walked in unannounced hoping we'd be able to find a corner. I got there early, spoke to whom I believe was the owner, who was more than excited to have us. She made suggestions about how we could accommodate ourselves. I got there about 45 minutes early, waited for the area she suggested. Then, she made signs for me!!! The ambiance was fabulous! The service was awesome! And all the coffee and snacks our group munched on were delicious! This is a woman owned business. It is obvious every aspect of the business has been thought about to provide an outstanding experience to the customer. We look forward to returning next time we are on the East Side."}
{"text":"Great little local coffee shop. The owner is extremely friendly, you feel welcomed, and it has one of the best chai tea lattes that I've ever had. There's a great, and creative fall menu out. I highly recommend taking the times check this place out versus going to Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Cosy and very friendly spot. Owner Jackie is a gem! Staff very knowledgeable about their products and most accommodating."}
{"text":"I loved this place before they moved. I'm glad they re-opened almost next door. I love the coffee and it's a good change from Starbucks. More cozy and less commercial."}
{"text":"Pretty sure they have closed. went to the listed address, only found a tech company in the building. bummer!"}
{"text":"Had lunch down the street and stopped in for coffee and conversation. The coffee was great and the service was fantastic. Had a conversation with (I think) the owner about her meeting with Obama. She's a great person to talk to - so nice. Cozy seating right in the front window! Will go back when I'm in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"I like to support unique, local establishments, so I thought I would check this place out, since it had several five star reviews here on yelp.  I would expect a five star place to have extraordinarily good products and ambiance.  This was not that.  The experience was not unpleasant, but it was really nothing special.  I'll start with the bad news, and work my way to the good.

The bakery selection is rather limited; a few muffins, small bagels, and brownies.  I ordered a hazelnut cappuccino.  I didn't really taste any hazelnut, and the cappuccino itself was kind of weak and watery.  But it was served in a ceramic mug, which is a big plus over the chain stores.

The store is pleasant enough.  The window nooks close to the street are pretty cool.  The barista was nice.  While I was there, several of her \"regulars\" came in, and she engaged them in conversation that suggested she knew them well.

I drove 25 minutes to get here, based on the five star reviews.  Not a bad place to go if you happen to be in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return to this place."}
{"text":"I was really desperate for coffee so I went here on the way home and I was completely satisfied. 

This quaint place was very welcoming and I was happy to see that you can enter from the rear of the building. 

The selection was not large but I think there's enough to quench anyone's thirst who visits them. I ordered a mocha and it was perfect! Not too sweet with the perfect temperature. 

Also, the lady who helped me was pleasant. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Cute, local gathering spot with tasty Berardi coffee and a fun, welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dropped in for coffee... Dark roast was excellent as was the service ... It has these two \"nooks\" out in the front window where one can situate yourself with a view of the street."}
{"text":"Great Coffee Great Atmosphere and the lady behind the counter was very kind. Found my new coffee place"}
{"text":"Visited Coffee Phix last evening, client meeting.  Nice place, quaint, cozy, personalized service."}
