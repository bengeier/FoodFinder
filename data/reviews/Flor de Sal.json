{"text":"It was a last minute booking, the 4 of us. 
Wanted to check out  this fully new  renovated Resturant.  
Very modern and done to the nines. 
Decor 10/10
Service extremely friendly 
The food was fresh and very very tasty. 
A bit pricy but well worth it. 
They have a lots a seating pockets within the Resturant(2 floors) great for 8-10 pips.  
Any way.fantastic."}
{"text":"This review is based on our experience at the restaurant 2-3 months after its opening. We haven't been back since that experience, but would like to try again if they've upped their game.

The biggest miss was food: it's not the ingredients or technique of cooking, but it's seasoning. At this price range, I would expect that everything is seasoned well... but it was quite inconsistent. There are so many restaurants opening up lately with similar quality of food for better value. If this is fixed, I think the value can be justified, given their beautiful space and attentive servers... (hopefully that remains the same)."}
{"text":"We were in the upstairs near the fireplace and seated side by side reminiscent of a Parisian cafe. Which was different, but nice. All the staff were friendly, prompt and courteous.

We started by sharing the mushroom tasting plate. It was great. There  was both variety of mushrooms and taste and enough to share. The Portuguese Medley will have to wait for next time. Our mains were the Monkfish and one of the daily specials, a venison chop. We shared a side of Brussels sprouts and double smoked bacon. Dessert was a shared salted caramel chocolate tort cake.

The whole building has been renovated from the original Corner House and is modern, clean and elegant."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Toronto. Flor de Sal offers fine dining at its best in a great garden setting. The menu is rich in variety, and Cristina the owner is no stranger to the kitchen. Great selection of seafood exquisitely prepared and professionally served.  parking is plentiful. 
This place will become a landmark !"}
{"text":"What a transformation from the previous restaurant (which we loved & frequented many times).  This restaurant is different in style & menu.  The renovations are top notch.  Feels like you are at a spa, very elegant, very clean lines, very modern. The food was very good. We enjoyed the sampling of oysters & the mushroom trio (Yums).  For our main course, we opted for the fish.  It was well prepared, moist and the portion size was ample.  We ordered the cheese tray for desert along with salted chocolate caramel cake (rich & sweet).  We paired the food with Portuguese white wine---quite nice.  If you are looking for a special evening & have some $$$ to spend, check it out.  You will be in for a treat!"}
{"text":"I am posting the link from the Globe and Mail review because it was indicative of our experience at this restaurant.  Nice room, friendly enough staff but the food for price was substandard and the service while attentive was amateur.  If you're in the market for five star Portuguese food you would be better off trying Chiado on College Street or Adega on Elm Street.

Flor de Sal is not worth the price of admission.

{"text":"I choosed to go to flor de sal to celebrate one of my team that so deserved a great meal. Based on the reviews that I read, including the reviews I religiously read in toronto life (which have not disappointed in the last year) I was expecting a lot from this restaurant and got disappointed. It was regular food at best, the flavors were not unique and the presentation of the food (except for a vegetarian meal specially ordered) was ok at best. The food arrived cold and the polenta served as an accompaniment to the branzino was caked to the cool plate. The service was nice enough, but flor de sal failed to deliver on the eating experience I was expecting."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! The fish was excellent. We had a white wine that paired perfectly with our oysters, lobster gnocchi, and fish. Definitely at the top of our list for restaurants."}
{"text":"Flor de Sal, the ambience itself will ignite the youthful or the seasoned romance in you at once. The 2 floor restaurant partitioned  in small, elegant rooms is perfect to remind you of the gone by romantic days when diners were enjoying good food with the loved ones and when the mobile invasion was not introduced to elegant dining. At Flor de Sal the ambience itself will dissuade the diner to pick up the phone for some useless conversation. The bar, albeit small is inviting and has the most warm atmosphere that is worth checking out. I was impressed and will visit the restaurant again. 

Now to the food. I was there with a friend lunch time. The Celric soup of the day laced with pesto sauce and fresh crab meat was heavenly. My friend ordered clams as an appetizer which accompanied pencil thin fries. The presentation was mouth watering and the generous serving gave me an opportunity to taste. The clams were meaty and cooked to perfection. It was lunch time so we restrained to some casual fare. My friend ordered Cobb salad and being a critic of food passed it on as the best he ever had. Well that was pleasing. I made the mistake of ordering a hamburger at Flor de Sal. One should neither offer nor order a hamburger in such an esoteric environment. It is sacrilegious. It is like wearing a pair of shoes in a Buddhist temple. Flor de Sal is temple of food and the hamburger, particularly a dry one with no character should be banished forever. Now wait a minute, don't judge the place with an odd entry on the menu. I saw my neighbour's  grilled fish arrive that sent my eyes wandering shamelessly on to his choice.  Well I was too full to order another entree. Before leaving the restaurant, I made another booking to visit the place next week. I know I will start with a dry martini at the bar. 

Now it is time close with my comments on service. We were received by Adam and served by Adam. Adam's mannerisms and etiquette totally match the Flor de Sal ambience. He is elegant, a good host and above all very caring. He served as if I was a squire in my own castle. Can't ask for better. 

I have not been complimentary of the new wave restaurants and have been  told so by my friends. My praise for Flor de Sal comes straight from the heart and not from the guilt from the comments my friends  have made about my reviews.

Cheers and enjoy.
Suresh Chawla.

{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening and there was no space on the streets to park and ended up parking right by George Brown College; later on that evening, the owner mentioned that we could contact the restaurant ahead of time to see if the building across the street could accommodate more parking, if needed.

Aside from that, this house, turned restaurant, is beautiful! Flor de Sal means Flower of Salt, an FYI. Service was exceptional and it was such a warm gesture when the owner came by our table and had a nice small chat with us and made it more of a personal experience. Food and ambiance was great; we had a great seat in the house, where we were cushioned with the window by our side. 

We'll be sure to visit this place again and book ahead of time :)"}
{"text":"Just excellent. The celery and crab soup was a treat. Atmosphere was pleasant and sunny. Fantastic spot for lunch. Have been here for dinner as well and staff are always friendly and accommodating. We dine out a lot in TO and it's so refreshing to enjoy food of this caliber in a warm and friendly atmosphere. Not pretentious or stuffy at all."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I came here for our three year anniversary. It was a wonderful dinner! 

The service was impeccable, both our waitress and (I believe) the owner were friendly and took very good care of us while we were there. This is the kind of restaurant that would refold your napkin for you when you leave the table.

We order oysters, the tasting mushroom platter, cantaro, and cataplana. For dessert, we ordered the plasteis de nata. Everything was absolutely delicious. Ordering the cataplana is a must! I thought the mushroom platter was a little too salty for my tasting. And the cantaro is a whole grilled fish in which they do leave the bones in. I've been to places that debone it for you, and I do prefer that option. 

The place is intimate and had a homely-feel to it, probably because it does look like it was once a house. When we walked in and throughout the night, everyone treated us like family.

I will definitely come back again to try out other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service. Very tasteful decor. Loved the place. Wine selection is rich and selected with great knowledge, very impressive. Don't forget to try their desserts, delicious and to me they are artworks. 
We were five people to dine there for the first time and we tried different dishes. All of them were unique, fresh and tasteful. We will definitely going back there again. Highly recommend to all."}
{"text":"Flor de sal is the perfect place for a date or special dinner. It's really classic, but cozy place. Service is great as well as food. Very nice place to spend time there, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I first met chef Roberto Fracchioni when he was running Monk Kitchen, a true \"hidden\" gem that was located in the basement of the Templar Hotel.   Sources tell me that Monk Kitchen is no more and the Templar Hotel is now void of its own restaurant.  I had taken my sister there last year for her birthday, and we loved Roberto so much that when we found out he is now cooking out of Flor de Sal, where the former Corner House was once located, we decided to go there for my birthday this year.

Cristina da Costa, former CHIN radio host turned restauranteur is the perfect hostess.  She greeted us at the door, checked up on us without being obtrusive and when she found out we were celebrating a birthday offered us a dessert/aperitif on the house.  She definitely knows how to make you feel special.

I'm glad that the dated d√©cor left with the Corner House as the space is minimalist but modern and the patio is extremely inviting.  Naturally, we both decide that's where we want to spend the night.

Dinner starts off with Portuguese corn bread which fails to excite me.  It was all too dense and rather bland.  The only saving grace are the duo of olives from Cheese Boutique.

Wines are pretty pricey though I do like that they have the option of a half-bottle which allows room for both a white and red wine, especially for a smaller party of 2.  My sister found a new favorite in the form of a Santa Rita Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon from Chile.  We quickly search the LCBO to find a full 750mL bottle for $13.95 while our half-bottle rang in at around $30.  That's just to give you an idea on the mark-up.

An amuse of Ricotta and Beamster-stuffed shisito arrives at our table on a bed of pine nuts and cherry tomatoes.  We quickly devour it.  The cherry tomatoes are sweet, plump and delicious and the shisito pepper is extremely satisfying.

We start with a bowl of Bulhao Pato, clams cooked in vinho verde with garlic and cilantro.  The serving is quite scant for the $18 price tag and I wonder if Fracchioni is taking Flor de Sal (which is the Portuguese-equivalent of fleur de sel) too seriously.  I'd normally sop up every drop of the cooking liquids with my bread, but...

A palate cleanser dubbed the Sicilian Lemon Bomb arrives at our table infused with Limoncello and sprinkled with pomegranate.

With mains starting at $39, one's expectation is high.  I opt for the Branzino, which comes grilled whole with lemon and rosemary tucked into various pockets of the fish but the kitchen is happy to fillet it for you if you don't want to do the work yourself.  The accompaniment of sorrel, farro and radish is bland and flavorless and is more there for plating than it is for consumption.  I certainly didn't waste any calories on it.


My sister's rack of lamb ($47) however, is fantastic.  Grill marks are not there just for show as you can taste the charred goodness through the mustard and oregano.  The fried artichokes get quickly consumed as my sister and I exchange glances before our forks race to finish the last piece.

It is worthy of noting that when we were originally deciding where to go for dinner that the final 2 considerations were Scaramouche and Flor de Sal.  We eventually opted for Flor de Sal because of our previous experience with Fracchioni at Monk Kitchen and the fact that it was named in Toronto Life's list of \"Top 20 Best Restaurants\" this year.  Suffice it to say that we were extremely disappointed in our decision to go with Flor de Sal (and will think twice before taking a recommendation from Toronto Life again)...we didn't even bother with dessert.  All we could think of was the coconut cream pie we could've had at Scaramouche.

Flor de Sal definitely looks the part, with its elegant interiors, the amuse and palate cleanser and its area code, but for the price tag, better food can be found elsewhere."}
{"text":"Flor de Sal is well designed and the wait staff are professional and helpful. The fish dishes were perfectly cooked but the vegetables were not up to standard:the rapini was tough and stringy, while the potatoes were old and soggy.
The chocolate desert was splendid, but the custard tarts were overly sweet.
It tool a very long time for us to get our bill at the end of the evening. It is one thing waiting for fish to be cooked to order, but by 9.10 the 5.45 service should be completed.
None the less I would return to Flor de Sal, just not order any cooked vegetables."}
{"text":"Had a truly wonderful meal here. The appetizers, main course, and desserts were all equally wonderful. The service was top notch. 

When they brought the bread I was initially disappointed. No oil and balsamic vinegar, no butter. Then I tried a piece. WOW, it was amazing and didn't need anything extra. 

The beef tenderloin was one of the best meals I can remember having. 

The chocolate torte was the perfect finish to the evening. 

The Lobster gnocchi was also incredible."}
{"text":"Fantastic from start to finish! Great location and decor. Top notch. The service is impeccable and the complimentary palatte cleanser is a testament to their level of excellence. Food was delicious -- we ordered oysters, and for entree lamb and the fish. Great Portuguese touches. You will not be disappointed and we are set to return in near future"}
{"text":"Stunning ambience. Food was really good but pricey. For the prices I'm not sure if I was blown out of the water, but it really was such a nice setting and the service was phenomenal - attentive but not annoying or pretentious - so I'll be back."}

TLDR: slow dinner service, bread is cold, water isn't free, food was okay, but not worth the price

I came here with a party of 15 for a birthday party - for a large group like us, we were escorted to a small, private dining area (4 tables of 4) upstairs. For those with limited mobility, dining upstairs may not be an option - the staircase was quite narrow and winding. While the banquettes were very comfortable and had a couple pretty throw pillows, the room itself wasn't as atmospheric as the rest of the restaurant. I'd suggest coming here in a smaller group to really take advantage of the beautiful design of the rest of the restaurant. 

Upon seating, the servers offered to take our coats, and we were given tags to retrieve our coats at the end of dinner. We were offered either sparkling or flat water, and the servers were good at remembering everyone's initial water choice. However, I was a bit peeved that we weren't told that the water wasn't free - we found out when it was listed on our bill. 

The complementary bread (2 types: rosemary, and a Portugese corn bread) was served cold. The rosemary bread was delicious, but would have tasted even better warm. I did not care for the corn bread because the crust was too hard. 

Our group received a free amuse bouche from the kitchen; rabbit terrine on a round of crusty bread, topped with an apple jam (not sure if the free amuse bouche is standard for all guests). It was alright, the rabbit tasted good but I did not particularly care for the apple. I tried the grilled octopus appetizer ($28). For the most part, it was cooked well (except for a chewy bit midway through the tentacle) and tasted good on its own. The wasabi aioli was overwhelmingly pungent. After the appetizer, we were served a grapefruit sorbet as a palate cleanser. 

I had the Steak Bitoque ($40), medium rare. It was cooked to the right temperature, and I quite liked the gravy and frites. The fried egg on top was unctuous. However, I felt that the choice to serve the dish with just pickled vegetables was a poor choice - the veg was just too chunky and sour; I would have preferred a medley of fresh vegetables instead. 

Overall, I felt that the food was good, but not quite worth the price. Dinner also took a very long time - our reservation was at 8:30, but we did not receive our entrees until nearly 10:20."}
{"text":"What a delightful evening we had at Flor de Sal. I couldn't be any happier with our dinner last night. 

The restaurant itself is a beautifully decorated house with several cozy intimate nooks and rooms for tables. What a brilliant idea! I LOVEEE the setup of this restaurant! 

The staff is very professional - absolutely no complaints there. The owner is such a gracious host! What a delight! She personally introduces herself and is involved with your dining experience throughout the night. This definitely warmed my heart and my experience here at Flor de Sal.

The food was extraordinary. The cheese platter was very enjoyable. The cornbread codfish, a traditional Portuguese dish, was beyond delicious. And the Natas are a must! 

I am truly delighted with our experience here. I will definitely be a returning customer. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. Congratulations to the owner Cristina for a brilliant restaurant that excels in every single detail!"}
{"text":"If you ever want to go to a cozy, luxury, beautiful, fine Resturant  the flor de sal is the place to go for. Amazing food, great ambiance, fantastic service is what you should expect for. The Resturant is beautifully decorated. I would definitely recommend this Resturant!!"}
{"text":"A poor experience made worse by an arrogant manager/owner who clearly lacks an understanding of how to create a fine dining experience. Just a few of the incidents that transpired:

1. We were told 7 minutes before the kitchen closed that one of the mains we ordered was no longer available.

2. It took 62 minutes before our appetizer (oysters) were brought out. The manager/owner happened to be walking by our table approx. 45 mins after we ordered, and we asked if it was possible the kitchen had forgotten to process our order. She dismissed us, saying 'it takes time to shuk the oysters' (perhaps this woman did not understand that it does not take 45 minutes to shuk 12 oysters?)

3. We ordered champagne and caviar. The champagne came out first, and then, 75 MINUTES LATER, the Caviar arrived. Any fine dining resto understands that when a patron orders champagne and caviar together, they are intended to be SERVED together, not an hour apart.

4. The only main course we ordered took 2 full hours to arrive - and only happened after we asked the waiter to cancel the order and bring us the bill. 

5. Another table voiced a concern to the manager/owner about the poor service and pacing, and her reaction was, 'This isn't fast food - it takes time' (I actually went to the other table to console the customer and explain that others in the dining room were equally annoyed)

It was this last comment to the other table that motivated me to write this review. This woman seems to believe that her customers have never dined at top tier restaurants before; as if everyone in the room had only eaten at Pizza Pizza in the past. She didn't seem to have any clue that her customers were actually sophisticated foodies, nor did she care.

Overall, this place ruined our night and we'll never go back. Nor should anyone else."}
{"text":"Just had a superb lunch of cantaro fish. Food presentation is pleasing without being fussy. The wait staff is helpful and professional. Don't be in a rush as the food is prepared when ordered. Save room for dessert! Glad to finally find such quality of food and service in Toronto."}
{"text":"Terrible service which was discourteous and slow. Food was good but when you have to wait two hours for dinner at a private event, this does not make sense. I think they're under prepared for large events. Also, icing on the cake was when they lost my take-out order."}
{"text":"I really walked away from this restaurant impressed, but also wondering about the next time I might come back. It's not to say that there aren't other restaurants just as good in Toronto, because there are. But I felt like every course hit the right note for me. I can imagine the taste of each one as I think about them again. And that's why I really liked this restaurant.

I came here on a Thursday night this week. There were five of us, so they placed us in a private room on the side upstairs. It was nice, but I think one of us had read that the larger room upstairs was nice and was hoping that's where we would've gotten to sit. I didn't mind though. I suspect we could've gotten moved if we had asked (not sure).

The menu is a nice one. Not overly large, but had a nice selection. I won't mention what everyone else at my table had, mainly because they got stuff that I couldn't eat (shellfish). But for appetizer, I had the sardines and we had some shishito peppers to share. Two sardines came on the plate, each was a nice sized (it is intended to be shared), served with arguula, potatoe and a sundried tomato salsa. It was a very nice flavour combination. None of the elements was dominant, and worked well together. The shishito peppers were nice too. I think I just really like shishito peppers, so they could've just put a basket of it in front of me and I would've been a pretty happy customer!  For entree, I got the sable fish. All I really need to say about this dish is: \"try it!\" The fish is filleted and cooked perfectly. It was so soft and tender. I don't know how else to describe it other than that maybe: it's the best dish I've tasted at any of the restaurants I've visited  this year. I'd come back to this restaurant just for this dish. I then had the passionfruit cheesecake. 

I'd have to say that service here was very good. I dont know if it's improved since May or if it's always been like this. But I think my experience was a pleasant one. The staff was patient not to interrupt conversation (even standing there waiting for our attention). I was explained what I could and couldn't get (because of my shellfish allergy) or if something could be removed from my plate if I wanted. When asked between different plates what they'd recommend, they explained what was unique about the different dishes, but also gave a response about which they liked. The owner (Cristina) also visited the table twice first to introduce herself. Second to follow up and see if there was anything we'd want. We had a friendly conversation with her. I can see that she has a lot of passion for her restaurant.

I'd have to say, for me, great food + great service, this place is definitely currently one of my favorite in Toronto. I'd come here again for sure."}
{"text":"Food. Service. Atmosphere. Everything was flawless. I would recommend this restaurant highly!  Toronto Life, naming it one of the 20 best new restaurants, got it totally right.   Enjoy the patio while the weather permits!"}
{"text":"Meh. Whatever. Cute, unassuming spot across from EJ Lennox and Henry Pellatt's castle. Portuguese/Mediterranean fare. The restaurant is a nicely decorated house with a drawbridge door. There's a box of tampons in the unisex bathroom. Fancy spot. The kitchen's appearance gives off michelin star vibes, I had to try the food. 

The lamb was ok. Well seasoned. Oddly prepared and plated. Wasn't too into it. 

The veal/burrata/spaghetti dish was good. The spaghetti was a bit over-cooked, but had brilliant flavour. Veal was nothing great, burrata was wasted in the dish. 

The side of Brussel spouts was decent, a tad over-cooked and mushy. 

Complimentary olives were simply phenomenal. Best olives I've ever had. Bread was stale, olive oil was nice. 

They also provided a ball of deep friend couscous which was sort of nice, at least, interesting, but not much different than deep fried potato. 

The restaurant is definitely trying, they take service seriously, sadly the food doesn't match the formalities."}
{"text":"Wow, just an excellent experience overall.
We had dinner there on a Saturday night and our waitress Joanna was just amazing, it seemed that's all the stars were aligned from atmosphere food and especially courtesy of Christina coming to our table to ensure that all of the services were two excellent and satisfying standards. Without a shadow of a doubt we shall return. Hats off to the great team keep up the outstanding level of service."}
