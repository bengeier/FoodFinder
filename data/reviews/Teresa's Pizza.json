{"text":"Although the pizza was good, the owner had terrible customer relation skills.  We grew up on Theresa's pizza and we were looking forward to enjoying it for a family get-to-gether.  We enjoyed 3 large pizzas.  As 1 family member finished her last piece, she pulled a long blond hair from between the sauce and cheese.  Since there was a large group, she did not want to make a big deal out of it. She simply stopped eating. I was sitting next to her and I told her we called the next day.   We spoke with a manager who said nothing but that she would have the owner call us.  When the owner called us, we explained and he gave no response.  I waited, still no response.  Finally I asked him if he heard me.  He said yes.  Finally, I asked him if he would remove the cost of the 1 pizza as it was obviously a bit gross. He said he didn't understand the whole situation. I explained again.  He was speechless.  We were expecting, \"We are sorry for your experience, but we appreciate your business.\"  We thought we would hear, \"Thank you for being loyal customers,\"  He could have given us credit for 1 pizza or offered another pizza for another time or a 1/2 off coupon.....nothing.  We had even told him we enjoyed the pizza, however, I think most people would agree that pulling out a 12 inch strand of hair from between the sauce and cheese, is a bit disgusting.    The funny think is, we are reasonable people and understand things like a hair in food may happen, but no apology, no simple discount off a future order (I had told him my parents eat their almost weekly. Is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I'm from out of town and have been to almost every state; plus Canada. The pizza I had delivered 2 weeks ago was awesome. I have another on the way. The reviews saying its greasy are crazy. It's because they use real cheese. Keep eating crap pizza or frozen if you want dry processed cheese."}
{"text":"Best pizza I had in a while. The cheese was incredibly delicious and so was the garlic sauce . We had a white pizza. Garlic bread was exactly that,  a piece of bread with a faint taste of garlic. Hard and lacking flavor.  It was not what I expected, I was expecting more of a soft bread sticks garlic flavored. But my kid loved it anyway. You only get one. The large pizza is actually a medium elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'd do 3.5 stars honestly.  Its a thick pizza.  Hefty amounts of cheese and sauce.  Just not enough toppings.  The flavoring can be a little limited.  But, it is very, very good the next day cold.  It sets perfectly that way."}
{"text":"Our family was passing through the area and decided Teresa's looked like a good option. We tried the bruschetta, calzone, ravioli and Tuscany pizza. The ravioli was a basic but tasty. We were very impressed with the bruschetta and the calzone and the pizza was first rate. Servers were very nice and friendly. Yum!"}
{"text":"The only positive thing I can say about my dinner from Theresa's was that there was an adequate amount of Kalamata olives on the greek salad, however, it did not make up for the fact that they included no dressing on the salad or on the side. We ordered cheesy breadsticks as well, and instead they gave us regular breadsticks that were hard and tasted like something you would buy from the freezer section at the grocery store, only worse. The pizza itself was incredibly greasy. I was excited to try a new pizza place that I hadn't tried before but it led to a disappointing dinner. Won't order from here ever again."}
{"text":"Used to love there pizza,usually get the deluxe. Pretty pricey, large $20 plus delivery. Gave tip of $5. For dessert I received a unhealthy does of food poisoning!!!! NEVER Again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't go. As a resident Theresa's pizza was welcome. It was (was) a good pie. Now we have rude employees with less than mediocre food. If you're in the area go anywhere else for pizza. Even the Mexican place next door!"}
{"text":"Good tasting crust. Not too sweet not too tangy sauce. People say they hate their toppings under the cheese....so just ask for it on top! Good ingredients."}
{"text":"Terrible phone service! Called & requested delivery, was told 25min. After waiting an hour and 10min, I called inquiring where my food was. The girl preceded to tell me she thought I meant pick up and if I still wanted the food it would be an additional hour! I told her to keep it! What's the point of answering the phone and asking pick up or delivery if you can't get it Right!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza square cut, with sausage and pepperoni, and extra cheese. Receive mushrooms and pepperoni regular cut with extra sauce. Called back twice and they picked up and promptly hung up.... Twice. Flys in the kitchen swarming me as I pay. Worst service in sagamore! Made a mistake of leaving a tip. Never again, and please check this place out health department. Garlic bread with cheese is garlic bread with a glob of cheese on half of it with foil stuck to the rest. Tryed this location before and gave it a second chance... NEVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"$17.00 for a 12\" veggie pizza that we had to pick up???  Really???   And it wasn't even good.  Not enough sauce,  barely any cheese or veggies. They call their 12\" a large...everywhere else,  that is a medium.  I seriously recommend somewhere else for your pizza!"}
{"text":"Three words. Get. The. Stromboli.   Mannn!  Filling, great sauce, nice crunch, that sexy cheese that pulls apart like on the commercials...you know the stuff!  But in all seriousness; excellent food, great service (gave me the last of the pre cut slices for free because they were \"old\"...and delicious). Everything from the wings to the pasta is very, very good. Some folks don't like the sweeter sauce, I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area by far! I love this place and eat here a couple times a month. Their sauce is home made and they are always generous with the cheese. Peperonis are always under the cheese which helps seal in the flavor.   The prices aren't cheap, but keep an eye out for coupons.  This is a pick up only location, so there is nowhere to sit down."}
{"text":"We had Teresa's Pizza for the first time with a salad, my husband and I LOVED IT! The pizza crust was flavorful and crispy perfectly and the pizza was full of cheese and toppings as was the salad (I'm a cheese freak).  Needless to say this is our new fav, don't hesitate to give it a try you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Greasy... Cheese pizza u eat it and pray u make it to see the next 2 years of life ..the cheese is so thick! That its hard! Please invest in a different type of cheese"}
{"text":"I attempted to place an order last night. After giving up on their terrible online ordering system, my husband called to place our order over the phone. The woman who answered was incredibly RUDE and obviously didn't want our large order placed one hour before closing. We live less than a mile away and she said they couldn't deliver to us because our address could not be located-although we have placed orders for delivery before. She eventually told us she wasn't going to take our order! I will never support this business again."}
{"text":"The pizza here is heavenly.  I have been getting pizza from here for many, many, many, years!  Ever since Tom and Teresa opened their first parlor in Maple Heights! Never, ever had a bad pie.  The quality is always the best, and the taste is magnifico. You'll never go wrong with a Teresa's pizza, I guarantee it!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed.  The store is dirty and not well cared for.  Ordered two large pizzas -  the size of the pizza is not much bigger than a personal pizza but the cost of a large. Will NEVER ever order from here again."}
{"text":"Get the pressure fried chicken and jojo's. It is the best fried chicken I have ever eaten.  I'm not a huge fan of their pizza but the pressure fried chicken easily gets them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love Teresa's pizza! They have a great lunch special during the week, perfect for a quick stop on your lunch break. I usually order extra cheese on my pizza, but you definitely don't have to! Their pizzas are cheesy! The salads (particularly the Greek salad) and wings are delicious as well!) My boyfriend usually orders a burger and fries, and he really enjoys the meal! I've always had great experiences with the staff. Love that there is such a great locally owned pizza place to support!!"}
{"text":"Matthew's right - this is the best guilty pleasure on the east side!  Yes, the pizza is greasy, there's a ton of cheese and the pepperoni is underneath the cheese, but these are all things I LOVE about Teresa's!  Was so happy when they opened locations in Mentor."}
{"text":"The best Jerry, the best. No other way to say it. I'm not a fan of pizza chain pizza but Theresa's by far is the best of the bunch."}
{"text":"I've been to this particular Theresas pizza several times. Each visit my experience's grew worse,from the quality of the pizza to the quality of the customer service. This has to be one of the worst pizza Establishments in Warrensville Heights Ohio and probably north eastern Ohio. The facility is filthy, upon my first visit I thought it had some old-school Brooklyn Pizza parlor feel to it I was mistaken it was just dirty, smelly and saturated with grease (i'm not talking about the pizza folks) i'm talking about the restaurant floor.so if you're in the mood for overpriced pizza with not enough cheese and too much sauce! This is the place for you"}
{"text":"One word...Yum...everything was cooked...very tasty...love the cheese..will be going back soon...live in Solon and none of the pizza places in Solon can compare...plus it's not overpriced."}
{"text":"The place where I work use to get their pizza when we worked late or had to work on Saturdays. I'm not picky about my pizza or food at all and I honestly have to say that Teresa's Pizza is some of the worst pizza I've ever had. Not only are their large pizzas overpriced, they're insanely greasy no matter which toppings you get on them like I'm talking we have to each use 4 paper plates so the grease doesn't seap through the plate on our desks. I'm glad we have finally switched to making the extra drive to Fairlawn to get Donatos or Gioninnos which is well worth the extra hassle."}
{"text":"LOVE Teresa's pizza! I just found out that they deliver to my area and I'm super excited! Our pizza is always cooked perfectly and hot! Super friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"What could have been a very aggravating work meeting took a turn for the better when the boss ordered Teresa's. MMMMM!! I can't say anything negative about this pizza, except maybe that some people might find it weird that the pepperoni is underneath the cheese. But I don't care, because it was so tasty!  Slices are a little small, but they pack a lot of punch.  Also tried the Greek salad, which was great too.  Closest to NY pizza that I've found since living in Cleveland. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Since all the bad reviews are extremely outdated, I thought I would put a new opinion in here.  Teresa's Pizza is actually quite good.  Yes, the 12\" larges are nothing to boast about and the price is not the cheapest, but you do get a very well made pizza in the end.  The sauce is just right and the authentic Wisconsin cheese is delicious, paired with the perfect thickness crust made with some awesome dough.  I'm not sure why someone would want to get a paper thin, greasy Donato's pizza over Teresa's.  So please, give Teresa's a(nother) try and take the reviews from 2+ years ago with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"We have been loyal customers for a very long time. Until last night  I ordered the same thing as always. My cost is usually in 30\"s. Last night it went up to the 50's. They said that's what I should have been paying all along. Others said I should be happy that I got a good price for so long. Really?  So now we are moving on to a better place. We did like their food but a 20 dollar increase is insane."}
{"text":"I have tried many pizzas in the area and Teresa's is one of my favorites. Great lunch specials as well. A must try if you haven't."}
{"text":"I love love love love their pizza. Although it is greasy, I mean come on it is pizza. The sauce is house-made and original, the cheese is thick and yummy. It usually arrives nice and hot, so when you take a bite, the cheese may fall completely off, but I'm a huge fan. I love it wayyy better than papa johns sweet pizza.  Always had fast delivery, but the downside is at this location, they tend to burn the bottom of the chocolate chip cookies and still send them. (MAKE SURE THEY KNOW YOU WILL SEND IT BACK!!) Also, old woman on the phone is pretty slow at taking orders and the other girl doesn't listen very well. I had ordered the rigatoni and meatballs but she didn't give me the meatballs. YUCK!  Besides the pizza, they have great dinners. You can get rigatoni w/ meatballs, salad, and garlic bread. I love their italian house dressing although not everyone would like it because it is a lot different than the traditional kind. Just make sure to shake it up lol. You can also get chicken parm, sandwiches and fries, and a variety of other things.   If your not a fan of the pizza, maybe you will be a fan of the dinners because they are off the hook!!  ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite pizza place would order 1-3 times per week but the lazy employees don't answer the phone now. They will turn on their answering machine saying they are closed as early as 45 minutes before they are supposed to be closed. I understand that they would stop taking orders before they actually close but come on 45 minutes????? And just to clarify whenever I order I pick it up and takes 15 minutes so no excuse for them to stop answering the phone at 8:15pm when they are open until 9. I will find a new pizza place I guess. BUMMED!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, the best around in my opinion. Don't expect great service, but the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Pizza is so yummy and garlicy!  Good tangy tomato sauce, too.  I would give it all the stars except for the fact they never want to deliver and make it pretty obvious.  We've started just doing carryout, but they do advertise delivery.    Other than that, great pizza, no toppings necessary, the cheese pizza alone has so much flavor you don't need anything else!"}
{"text":"Yuck!  The pizza here is disgusting.  I paid $13 for a cheese pizza that I wanted to throw out.   Also, the woman who took my order gave me a dirty look.  My personality may not be great, but it's not as disgusting as their pizza.  Customer service might have earned them a second star.  This place is to be avoided."}
{"text":"Ordered here for first time today. Ordered stromboli and they didn't give me any marinara sauce. Ordered garlic cheese bread and got burnt garlic bread with no cheese. I paid extra for the cheese bread. Probably be the last time I eat here."}
{"text":"Meh.  That about sums it up. They definitely live up to their nickname \"Grease-a's\"  If it wasn't for the $5 lunch deal for two large slices of pizza and a 20oz soda this place would get a solo star."}
{"text":"Got a flyer for Teresa's when we moved into our new place and decided to try them out on Mad Monday, when they have a BOGO deal on large pizzas.   The girl on the phone was very sweet, and the pizzas arrived quickly. We decided to try out a Spinach Florentine (spinach and artichoke w/ Italian cheeses) and a chicken pizza with broccoli. I asked for garlic on the chicken pizza as well, and the girl gave me the idea to try white garlic sauce instead. Since I'm not a huge fan of tomato sauce, I figured that'd work out well.  The first thing that struck us was that the pizzas are SMALL! Their \"large\" looks like what most place's medium looks like. We also noticed a severe lack of artichoke on the Spinach Florentine. Other than that, everything was pretty good. They really pile on the cheese, so it's a bit greasy, but it is nice for those who prefer more cheese. They went very light on the sauce on both pizzas, so if you're big on sauce, you may want to ask for extra. My chicken pizza had plenty of chunks of chicken and broccoli. Very nice crust, too -- I rarely find a crust that I like, but this seemed very authentic. It was just the right thickness -- nice and crunchy, but not brittle. Great taste.  The only other issue for us was the price. It was about $13 for each pizza. With the size being so small, it definitely made me think twice about ordering from here again. But I think if they keep doing the Mad Monday deal, $13 for two pizzas is more than worth it, so we'll order then."}
{"text":"This place is great. I tried their greek salad & loaded fries and they were soooo good."}
{"text":"Ordered the 3 cheese pizza and added chicken and mushrooms.  Pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  Also got a side salad, which was pretty good.  Really good pizza option...  Takeout/delivery only."}
{"text":"Not happy at all. Was extremely disappointed.  Requested no onions on pizza, GOT ONIONS. The bbq  hamburger pizza was too watery. Pizza not even cut! Finally do not get boneless chicken wings they are more like nuggets and for $8.00 I expected more. Proceed with caution"}
{"text":"Not good. We threw most of our pizzas away! If you have to order something here, get the mac and cheese bites. Try Romeos instead."}
{"text":"I think it's pricey and the pizza has an an offsetting taste of cinnamon to it. It is not my favorite but my husband and son love it."}
{"text":"This is good local pizza. It doesn't have that pizza chain restaurant feel. The sauce is robust and the taste is wonderful. Fast friendly service. I completely recommend this place."}
{"text":"They closed because Bistro 83 is taking over the space.   I've been sobbing ever since.   Please come back.   Highly unlikely because I saw their supplies sold on Craigslist.   I'm so sad."}
{"text":"First and last time. I ordered online.  I ordered a 4 slice THIN crust pizza that would almost have bought me a large Papa John's pizza. Got a thick crust that the sauce tasted strange.  Ordered Fries with cheese sauce. I I got Cheese Sticks.  Ordered Garlic Parmesan Wings. They were like plain wings in about 2 tbsp of a very runny tasteless liquid.  They insisted on a store credit or replacement. No adjustment on my credit card. The person I was speaking to (said there was no manager on duty) hung up on me.  Do yourself a favor. DON'T EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Lent Dinner Review  We got a flyer in the mail with pretty glossy pictures of 3 limited time lent special dinners.... fried haddock... butterflied fried shrimp... and baked whitefish... all $9.99.  We have had such inconsistent food and service that I have never tried to sort it out for a review... but this time it wad pure meh!  Single piece of haddock was moist but smothered in greasy batter with a pool of grease at the bottom of the container.  The shrimp were small... also over breaded... and swimming in grease... and came with a tiny cup of ketchup... no cocktail sauce?  The krinkle cut fries were nice and crispy since we saved them from the grease with paper towels once we got home.  I would love to like this place... but they make it difficult."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever !!!!! Even better then next day ! Any party we have we always order from here !!! There house salad with homemade Italian dressing  is so so good."}
{"text":"old school greasy and delicious pizza. Sauce is smooth and sweet everything always seems fresh. Best pepperoni pizza in the area, also really like the garlic butter white sauce."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have noted, I am not a fan of the pizza (too greasy) but I ordered multiple pans of their rigatoni w/ meatballs for a dinner I was having (40+ teenage boys w/ some parents) and the food was excellent.  They delivered on time, it was hot and well packaged.  Most important - everyone commented how good it was.  The sauce was flavorful, the meatballs were cooked but still tender, large in size, and were presented in the same great sauce.  One of the adults said it was better than a nearby higher end restaurant.  A few people said they would start ordering Teresa's pasta for takeout, based on how good this meal was."}
{"text":"Greasy, greasy pizza.  The crust was good - nice and yeasty - but we needed to blot the slices to keep the grease from streaming down our arms.  My kids decided to pass because they'd take a bite and the cheese would just slide completely off.    The house salad was iceberg lettuce, black olives, green olives, banana peppers and some cheese.  Pizza night is never a nutritional win, but that is a sorry excuse for a salad.  Delivery was quick, so maybe we'll try again - but something different."}
{"text":"Not your average small town pizza joint.   I am always looking for a good pizza joint an this one nails it. I am a fan of deep dis pizzas and there is nothing really that good in the area. This isn't exactly a true deep dish style pizza, But it is better than most of the pizzas out there. Im a fan of the crust, its really tasty and just right. Definitely give these guys a try if you have nothing planned for dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst food. Gave them two chances. First ordered a pizza and got no sauce and very little cheese for ten dollars, no other toppings? Second time around ordered a calzone with pepperoni sausages,and mushroom. Came with no mushroom and sauce on the side was terrible ,made me vomit. It's now the next morning and still sick."}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with pizza. Usually, the tomato sauce aggravates my reflux and leaves me distressed for an evening. However, I find that Teresa's sauce is not only delicious, but does not aggravate my reflux. Every time I order I receive exactly what I ordered, fresh, and piping hot --as pizza should be enjoyed. The one time I did have an issue, the staff was prepared to correct the issue at no charge or greater inconvenience to me. The toppings are plentiful, not stingy and the cheese is delicious. My DH also tells me they have good wings too. We are regular customers and I highly recommend this pizzeria:"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza at 7:27pm. They called us at 9pm saying they just realized that we are outside their delivery area (we live 5.8 miles away). We called to check on the order twice and they kept telling us it was in progress but never mentioned the delivery issue. We spoke to a manager, who quickly blamed the person who took the order saying that they never should have taken it. Worst customer service I have ever dealt with, will never use/recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious! The food is reasonably priced, and the delivery is reasonably fast. The white pizza is cheesy just the right amount of oil and garlic. We also got a chef salad which was very good. I couldn't be happier to have a great alternative to the pizza chains!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Sweet, thin sauce - normally I like a sweeter pizza sauce but this was just kind of gross and didn't taste very tomato-y. Very expensive - pizza came in a large box but when we got home and opened it up, there was plenty of open space. I can honestly say I hated it, but still giving it two stars as the boyfriend thought it was OK."}
{"text":"First time here and I am a big fan of their fried chicken. Yep, I said it fried chicken. They use the Henny Penny pressure fryer. Take that, the marinade, and spiced flower and it makes it so good. Nice job Matt. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Do not get an olive pizza here!  In fact this is now on my LIST to NEVER get food from again. The olives have Pitts  in them. When a family member called to complain they said this is what we do here. This seems like a violation and the health department will be contacted plus whomever else.  Break a crown on this pizza. Owner doesn't care apparently.  Check out my pic of the Pitts on my plate."}
{"text":"What a disappointment this place is! They now pre-bake their pizzas, refrigerate/freeze, and reheat them when you order. The result is a pizza that is burnt on the edges and ice-cold & soggy in the middle. Its the worst pizza I've ever gotten in a pizzeria and not even as good as the supermarket brand frozen kind. I don't see how they can stay in business very much longer with this lousy product. They used to have very good pizza. Those days are, unfortunately, long gone."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good and one I grew up on. Super cheesy and has a delicious sauce with a nice on the thinner side crust.   The wings are delicious as well, the hot has a nice punch and they give you a good amount of sauce.  Loved getting food from here throughout the years, always a solid, consistent place."}
{"text":"I don't like their pizza but love their veal and chicken parmesan . I'm never disappointed. Unfortunately they've never had good customer service when ordering by phone. Some of them can be unprofessional."}
{"text":"It was edible.   The only thing we really liked was the Italian dressing, but that was quite disappointing . . . because the dressing was ours because they forgot to pack it with their tasteless iceberg salad."}
{"text":"As much as I want to support this local pizzeria down the street from me, its impossible due to their expensive price for a large pizza that isnt anything special.    Slightly sweeter sauce and cheese that falls off the slice exposing the plain, kind of boring pizza.  I would only go if you had some kind of coupon, even then its hard to compete with the $10 'many topping' specials going on everywhere else now."}
{"text":"My Husband & I Are Very Pleased With Our choice To Order Pizza from Teresa's Thanks to Valpak For having coupons. We were skeptical but decided to go for it. It Was Fresh, Hot, Delicious, Flavorful, Saucy & Cheesy. The Spicy Garlic Wings Are Amazing. Our first time won't be our last time  ~The Carter's"}
{"text":"Just moved into the area, saw it on my way home, thought I'd give them a shot.  It was Monday, so I ordered two large pizzas for their special: a Spinach Florentine and a Three Cheese.  The crust on both was nice and crispy, and definitely appreciated the amount of cheese on each pie; this is what you pay for.  I'm interested in trying out more of their menu items, and the free delivery will probably serve me well when I'm in the middle of programming hell.  One thing that happened while I was at the restaurant that I overheard: someone called in wanting a pizza done half pepperoni, half barbecue chicken.  They wouldn't do the order, and I applaud them for saying no, because that would not have ended well...someone would have wound up with either a burnt pepperoni half or an undercooked barbecue chicken half.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lets talk Pizza! I feel a bit silly, we've lived in the heights for over 2 years and I've never been here.   We ordered delivery last night and holy cow was it amazing!  Easy to order and was delivered very quickly.   We got a large deluxe pizza, chicken parm dinner and cheesy bread sticks.   The chicken parm was amazing. It came with a salad of my choice and legitimate garlic bread, with chunks of garlic on top! The sauce was amazing and the chicken itself was so tender I didn't even need a knife. It really hit the spot.   The deluxe pizza!! So full of flavor amd its handmade dough. I've worked in the pizza biz my entire life. Trust me, I can tell the difference. It melted in our mouths. The toppings and cheese wasn't overwhelming and the sauce. Goodness, it was perfect.   We will most definitely order from here again. Such fantastic food and service. Plus, the hand made dough is really rare these days. I loved it!   I'd highly recommend this place. If you're used to frozen dough pizza places. Give your taste buds a treat and visit this place. The difference is incredible."}
{"text":"OK pizza OK deals OK delivery.  I would recommend this place for quick pizza. Aka late night za."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to enjoying Teresa's pizza but was so disappointed in all 3 xtra large pizzas I picked up. $48.00 I paid . The crust was so bland and lacking in flavor and didn't seem that fresh. The sauce was watery and again no flavor or spice in the sauce. The sausage they use is the \"dog food\" shaped kind which is pretty gross. I got one pizza with white sauce with broccoli and mushroom and again no flavor of garlic in the white sauce either. I wonder if they are even sampling or taste testing what they are making. I hope they can get their act straightened out because I really did love their pizza and would love to go back."}
{"text":"Prices online for menu are WAY LESS than when you get there. Like way more in reality so that was a surprise. On top of that after such a high markup the food was literally disgusting and I had maybe 3 pieces of chicken on the entire pizza which I paid $3.50 extra for. That same pizza was also so soggy it fell apart. Apparently they don't like to drain the liquid from the veggies, as I witnessed in person the guy actually squeeze the liquid from a handful onions on to the pizza. Ew. The cookies were all melded together and not even cooked all the way. Again, disgusting. Total rip off, bait and switch. Terrible quality and bad in store, in person service. Will never go here again and I urge all locals to avoid this place at all costs or if you like to be disappointed and pissed off, then by all means, Teresa's is the place for you. Literally worst decision I have ever made for dinner, ever. P.s. Should really update the site to reflect the prices. This place is a scam with shitty food so not worth even the lower prices shown online. Oh and it took 37 mins to actually walk out with my carry out order"}
{"text":"I really didn't care for this pizza. I found it rather bland. I'm embarrassed to say that I actually had to add a little bit of salt just to give some flavor! The crust isn't too greasy, and the cheese was plentiful, but is was kinda just blah."}
{"text":"Personally, I really really like this pizza. I love the type of cheese they use. However, my wife pointed out that the sauce has a slightly strange flavor. Once she pointed it out, I would have to agree. If the sauce was a little sweeter I think I would give them a 5 star."}
{"text":"If you have never eaten Teresa's Pizza, you are missing out on one of the greatest pizzas you will find. Period."}
{"text":"This pizza is straight amazing. The toppings are all quality, the crust is perfect and the rest of the menu is pretty stellar too.  It is all classic greasy pizza joint style, but they make the salad dressing in house, and the spaghetti/rigatoni dinner options are always a good choice. I don't live in Ohio anymore but this place is my first food choice when I get to my parents house.  I would recommend always picking up, it is much faster and they are usually backed up and delivery can take a while, but when you pick up the food is ready pretty fast."}
{"text":"I think Teresa's is a love/hate pizza joint. You either love it, like Rachel B. or you hate it like Kerensa B. Well I'm here to settle the tie. I absolutely love it!   When it's pizza night at the house and I'm short on time or inspiration, Teresa's Pizza is my #1 go to local joint for take out.   All I ever get is the traditional large with pepperoni. The pepperoni is uniquely layered under the cheese. This works well because a lot of times, thin sliced pepperoni on other pizzas dry out easily when on top (I'm talking to you Donato's). Keeping it under the cheese helps keep the moisture in.   The dough is not crisp, it's borderline soft, but it serves as a good platform for the real star of this pie: the bed of the most glorious low-rent cheese you'll ever have on a pizza! I think I heard somewhere a long time ago that they use a blend that consists of more provolone than mozzarella. When melted, it binds into a solid disc of cheese instead of the typically stringy mozzarella. This is where the divide probably comes in. To some that's completely unappetizing. I think it's wonderful though! It's probably awful for you and I usually get a stomach ache after eating 4 slices, but it's sooo good! Best guilty pleasure in the Eastern 'burbs is most definitely Teresa's Pizza!"}
{"text":"White pizza is good, normal regular salad is good. I ordered the grilled chicken salad and was expecting a grilled chicken breast like shown on their website. It was pulled chicken, cold, and looked undercooked. Bummed."}
{"text":"Poor customer service as well as phone etiquette, retrain and have your ppl get orders correct and  help them to at least sound pleasant  on the phone."}
{"text":"They recently changed owners (same name) and so far out of the three times we've ordered in the last few weeks  2/3 were wrong. First time we ordered salads and received NO dressing. We were already home before we realized it, so we called to at least let them know. I was able to stop back the next day to pick up their dressing so I could eat my salad (a day later). While there I bought an extra bottle of dressing- sort of thought they'd give it to me for free (or discount), but they didn't.   Ordered a pizza a week later. Definitely made differently bc the cheese covered all the toppings. Not a big fan since you can't see what's on the pizza when you're eating it.   Ordered two salads again a week later.  Forgot one of the dressings again. Also, found a rotten mushy piece of lettuce on the bottom. They also crumble the chicken now whereas before it we actual cut up thin pieces of chicken. This used to be our go-to once a wake for salads and/or pizza, but think we've struck out."}
{"text":"No matter how low your pizza standards are, you will be disappointed. Also, if you order a large it is the size of a personal pizza at many restaurants (no joke). You're better off going to the grocery store and buying a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"Orders Teresa's pizza for the first time for a family of seven. Ordered three large pizzas. When they got here I was shocked at the size. They were so small.  toppings were adequate and cheese was plentiful. Flavor profile was lacking.  $52.00 for three large pizzas would be a fair deal, however for the size of Teresa's it was a huge ripoff.  11\" pizza is a large...buyer beware!!!"}
{"text":"I placed a order for garlic parmesan BONELESS WINGS and a salad..... Total was 13.98 I picked up my order went back to my hotel and opened my to-go box inside were chicken nuggets sprinkled with what looks like kraft parmesan cheese that you usually see topped on a plat of spaghetti. If you plan on getting boneless wings as pictured on the Google page you'll be very disappointed, I can only describe them as costco chicken nuggets spritzed with a butter and parmesan cheese flakes. They're dry and greasy at the same time. I would've rather saved 3 dollars and got twice as many nuggets from Mc Donald's if I knew they were gonna try and pass these off as wing! The salad was decent considering the lettuce to topping ratio favored the toppings 2:1, overall I'm not impressed and won't be eating here again. Please change your menu to say nuggets instead of boneless wings it's pathetic."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I have ever had.  Cold and greasy. The pizza shop is dirty and I witnessed a employee handling food without  gloves. GROSS. The sub was soggy and the salad was limp and warm.  Overpriced and NASTY. Wasted 50 bucks.   CLEAN UP YOUR BUSINESS."}
{"text":"I have no idea why anyone would give this place a bad review. The delivery driver couldn't be nicer, the salad was perfectly fresh (and you can choose your toppings), the homemade Italian dressing is delish, and the provolone cheese they use is a nice change from bland mozzarella.   I'm surprised at reviews that say the pizza crust is too greasy - ours was perfectly done. We look forward to ordering again. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Teresa's Pizza is one of the top pizza places in Northeast Ohio.  It is a very cheesy pie which might turn off some people but if you enjoy your pizza like that then it can't be beat.  The sauce is also amazing and is slightly sweet and NOT acidic at all.  This is technically a chain but each one I have been too stays faithful to the original. This location is take out or delivery only which is nice cause its usually under 20 minutes to wait for a pickup order."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was around 14 always have loved the bbq wings i suggest those to any wing lover they have a sweet smokey taste to them. Also I enjoy the pizza I love how they put the toppings under the cheese the flavors are just so amazing. I always get the pepperoni and sausage occasionally I get ther extra cheese but that's a little much because they already load you up with cheese. The only reason I give Them Four stars is because when you get delivery it is a hour wait and I literally stay 5mins away so that is a little ridiculous. Other than that the taste is amazing"}
{"text":"I don't understand the good reviews about this place? I rarely write a negative review but I felt compelled this time. We try to support local establishments so we thought we'd try Teresa's over our normal pizza place. When we called to order, we were surprised to hear that they won't split toppings (meaning, you can't get half sausage and half pepperoni on one pizza!) Then, we were also surprised by the price but hoped for good quality ingredients. My husband got a calzone and I got a small pan pizza. Both were below mediocre and I only had one piece and regrettably ended up throwing the rest away. The dough had absolutely no flavor and the entire pizza was bland. My husband didn't enjoy his calzone, either. I'm just not sure how you can mess-up dough, cheese and sauce but we won't be ordering from Teresa's again! There are FAR better pizza places around for the price with even less hassle! I recommend Angelo's in Lakewood (I always take my Chicago co-workers there and they all proclaim it to be better than Chicago) or Pizza By Robert, both of which are owned by brothers so they're very similar. So disappointed in our Teresa's experience. :("}
{"text":"I always order from here when I'm craving pizza for lunch. The pizza is greasy & delicious, a bit over priced, but it's better than the other pizza shops that deliver to my work."}
{"text":"Best part of the meal was the dr. Pepper I got. The slice of pepperoni pizza I got was subpar and probably had been out all day. The bbq chicken sub I had was cold half way through. I would not recommend this to a friend for lunch. I would possibly try a fresh pizza. Overall, unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, service is great! Everyone I have encountered here is very friendly, making it an overall great experience. We went with a cheese pizza and breadsticks. Pizza cheese does fall off easily but still tasty! I would recommend this place and will continue to go back"}
{"text":"Can't say that I feel this location is clean nor tasty. The pizza doesn't taste any better than one from a school cafeteria; it's greasy, cold, and lacking in flavor. The staff isn't all that friendly either."}
{"text":"I have to say that this is my absolute favorite place to order pizza. I am a cheese addict and Teresa's is very generous with the amount of cheese you would like to be put on your pizza. Their homemade italian dressing is amazing as well. I have never had a problem with them and always receive great customer service. If you're looking for a tasty pizza joint this would be it!"}
{"text":"When people say their pizzas are smaller than you expect, they aren't kidding. We ordered a large two topping with green peppers and onions and it was the size of a small or medium elsewhere. Even Romeo's pizzas are larger and they're on the small size. That said, there was a ton of cheese as expected and the crust was nice and crispy. The pizza was a gigantic mess however because there was entirely too much sauce on half the pizza and because of the vast amount of cheese the pieces wouldn't pull apart properly. The sauce wasn't very good in my opinion and tasted more like a cheap spaghetti sauce than a proper pizza sauce. The pizza wasn't bad, just disappointing. Very disappointing. Ordered some cheese breadsticks which were okay, but really ugly. The end pieces barely had cheese on them and the middle ones had so much that it pulled off the bread stick when we ripped them apart. Not going to be getting them again and I highly doubt I'll ever come here again. Incredibly disappointing, especially for the price."}
{"text":"We've eaten at the downtown location and had great chicken parm. However, we ordered pizza delivery and when we got it, the cheese and mushrooms were all slopped to the side of the box.  Terribly messy.  Wings were decent but very very hot.  Wouldn't order pizza from them again.  Crust was so hard and pizza had too much cinnamon. It was ok but not for $17 for a pizza."}
{"text":"This place has an average of three and a half stars? Really? We ordered a veggie pizza the other night and it was pretty dreadful -- soggy, bland and way overloaded with black olives. The side salads were fresh enough, but the \"house\" Italian dressing lacked character. The delivery guy was friendly, and our orders arrived quickly, so I'm giving Teresa's an extra star. Woohoo."}
{"text":"This pizza must not be for me.  Way too much cheese.  Service is good, I just didn't care for the pizza."}
{"text":"We love ordering from here! We enjoy the wings and the pizza. So good. Ordering right now!"}
{"text":"New to the area and looking for a good pizza place that delivers. This is not the place! The pizza was average at best, the bonless chicken wings were not good and the slad??? what was that...the italian dressing was nasty."}
{"text":"I decided to try Teresa's pizza.  I remember getting it as a kid from the location that was across from Geauga Lake.  My first bite took me back to my youth.  I am not saying it is amazing pizza, but it is good.  The crust is nice, not too dense, the sauce is very tasty, and the cheese is plentiful.  I am not sure what cheese blend they use, but it gets very hard when cold - but it is very good.  They also put the toppings under the cheese which is kind of unique.  I ordered a pepperoni and mushroom, and didn't find it to be crazy greasy as others have reported.  I also ordered some buffalo wings which were tasty but very spicy - next time I will get the mild."}
{"text":"I have traveled throughout the states looking for a great pizza pie, with a succulent sauce to die for, and I have founded it!  Theresa's Pizza is by far the best pizza I have ever experienced thus far.  I have been to a few locations and all were surperb, however this establishment besides the downtown Cleveland,Ohio location does not provide seating and are strickly pick up locations.  Never judge a book by it's cover because this pizza rains supreme. always fresh toppings and always hot and cheesy!.  I usually order the pizza with pep and sauage.  also bbq wings are tasty."}
