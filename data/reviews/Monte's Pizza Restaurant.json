{"text":"New ownership the deals on here or the free, don't follow these existing reviews, will be checking it them out tonight with new owners! :)"}
{"text":"Sry for the 3 stars. It wouldve been 5.  Yesterday was our 3rd time ordering from u. The past 2 times everything was great, but this time it was disappointing. The chicken wings, fries, cheese sticks in the sampler were all over cooked. My steak sandwich didn't have any cheese, but it was still good. The pizza was great, just the way I like it. Idk if it was just an off day or the cook, but $50 plus everything should b on point and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this place for years and unfortunately I have not very many good things to report. The pizza is subpar. But honestly can you get good pizza in this town? I have lived here for 10 years and have yet to find a pizza that is halfway decent. I only order from this place because it is close. But even though it is just down the road it takes them 45 min to an hour to deliver lukewarm pizza and God forbid you get something else other than pizza. I called just now to check on my pizza that I ordered about an hour and 10 minutes ago just to be told it will be another 20-30 minutes more. And also no discount for THEIR OBVIOUS INCOMPETENCE!!! I have meant to report on Yelp about them for awhile now and have just gotten around to it because of my UTTER DISGUST for their loyal customers. I know that it is my own fault for continuing to order from here but can any of my fellow Yelpers in North Las Vegas recommend a better place??? At this point I am ready to pick it up myself. Thanks in advance."}
{"text":"New owner! Great food especially white pizza ! Yummy!! They had c rating and service was bad! Now with new owner ! Much great improvement! Cheap to eat and good daily specials!"}
{"text":"Warning ! Worst experience ever ! Anti sanitary !!! How can you guys operate at this dirty basement ? I never saw so many roaches in one place !!!!"}
{"text":"I also do not understand why there are horrible reviews for this location. My husband and I order from there quite regularly. Every time the food is amazing. So far we have had their pizza, wings, salads, burgers, fries, and garlic knots. All of have been great every time we ordered. We do pick up primarily but, when we eat in the service is always excellent."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from here for the past few years when I want to spend an extra five bucks over the chain pizza place. It's usually really good but the first time I ordered a chicken pizza and I'm 99% sure it's turkey"}
{"text":"Not ordering from them again. Cheesesteak came soggy and garlic toast was burned and hard as a rock. Sorry, not ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken fingers and garlic knots they said that it would be an hour to deliver. It now has been over 2 hours still no food. I live literally live not even half a mile away. I called and told them I wanted my money refunded onto my card and don't even bother to come. Will never order from this place again horrible service!"}
{"text":"Our food arrived in a timely manner, but when we opened the box, it looked like it had been dragged behind the car and the pizza was destroyed.  Ordered the pizza with extra sauce and it had no sauce and no flavor.  The Appetizer Sampler had 3 jalapeno poppers, 3 mozzarella sticks, 4 un-breaded slivers of zucchini, two un-breaded onion rings and what looked to be the scrapings from the bottom of the deep fryer. Bleh!  My wife called to complain about the pizza and we were offered a credit towards a pizza in the future, but to be honest, I don't think we will ever go back."}
{"text":"1 star because there is no 0.   It's hard to find places that deliver at 1 am while at work. they had a nice website set up and great menu options, however, apparently that's where they put their money. Cuz the staff sucks. We Ordered our food, Cheese Burger and Italian Sub, online and they said it would be 45-60 min. It's a habit so we called and confirmed they received the food shortly after. 2 HOURS LATER!!!! food still hadn't arrived. When we called they said \"It was in the oven and would be 15 min.\"30 minuets after arrival time we called on a different phone to check if our food was on the way. The female that answered said \"Yes\" without asking our name or order number then promptly hung up.    The food finally arrived 3 hours late, Burger was Cold, Sub was Soggy.   Highly Unprofessional, Seriously Overrated."}
{"text":"Can't say much about the food because I ordered delivery and 90 minutes later the driver showed up without my order. I called and the manager was willing to redo the order but would not expedite my order, so she was willing to lose me as a customer. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"This place is atrocious.  Patrick the pizza chef is a very rude person, calling customers fat, cussing them out, yelling and cussing at children that are age 6 and under and the staff stands there and says nothing and when asked for a manager there is not one there.  This is uncalled for and just because Patrick says that he and the owner are very good friends, I hope that business and customer service mean more to the owner than having his best friend Patrick speaking to paying customers like that. Will never recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We have been customers for a while now the delivery is usually ok I sent in a comment to the company to note our concern,  they never even responded it took almost 2 hr to get a large pepperoni delivered to our address which they have done on several occasions however this Friday it was cold not in a insulated bag and the driver didn't even show concern NEVER and I mean NEVER will I order from them they just take your money with no concern of customer service or returning customers well there are just to many pizza joint to put up with this"}
{"text":"Was going to order pizza and wings but they won't even sell an order of 12 wings!  All they have is 4 or 8 with fries which we don't want.  Never heard of a place that wouldn't sell wings by the number.  Stupid so canceled the pizza and will go with someone else."}
{"text":"I was really hesitant to try this place after the reviews but because it's so close to my house I took a chance. I think it's delicious! I've only had the pizza so I can't speak for any of the other food but the pizza has always been good. I'm so happy to find a good pizza place so close to home!"}
{"text":"Good food and service! This is near our house and we come often. Pizza, pasta and wings/fingers are all good."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff are always pretty nice to us and treat us pretty great! It sucks that they never have anybody in here. They always have really great food for insanely low prices! I agree that if you come in and there's only 2 people working there, it's gonna be slow, but for the food and prices, I don't mind chating with my friends for 15 minutes. Really incredible food and incredible prices! Surprisingly, the burgers are one of my favorite things about this place. Anyways, check it out! It's tasty!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza, knots, and boneless wings.  Pizza tasted like a thinner crust pizza from the likes of domino's or pizza hut. Garlic knots were over cooked and hard. Chicken was ok, nothing out of the norm, but Not worth the money to ever eat there again."}
{"text":"I like this place close to home friendly people and good food. Pizza is good and Philly sandwiches"}
{"text":"Came in here with my dad on Saturday night. We ordered 2 pepperoni strombolis go go and he got a piece of pizza. Over all it was pretty good!! I was a little bit skeptical because there was nobody in the restaurant (customers) but a few people popped in as we were waiting. The lady behind the counter was friendly.   My dad asked if they make their dough from scratch and she said yes, so that's a plus being an Italian. :D"}
{"text":"Phone number listed on yelp is turned off. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it took 1hour and 30minutes to be delivered. The pizza was cold, charged me 5$ for delivery when the ad in the mail states 1.30$, not knowing I gave the driver a tip plus the $5 they charged me. When I called to check on my delivery the lady was grumpy and unpleasant. The pizza sucks, the hot wings suck they were sitting in grease not sauce, the only thing that I enjoyed was the soda! DON'T EAT HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"The worst place ever, they were rude to my kids. The food needs serious help. I'm telling everybody I know not to go there."}
{"text":"Worst place to order from , the fries are dry,stale.... the lady on the phone named BREN  is rude , incompotent, has no customers service skills. The pizza is dry the cheese looks like imitation, hard... not a real Italian food ."}
{"text":"Oh God I wish I would have read these reviews before I came here. Worst experience ever. I ordered my food over the phone and was told it would be done in 20 minutes. We got there in 30 minutes. As we were about to pay, my husband saw a guy in the kitchen drop a bag a fries on the floor, which spilled out all over the floor, scoop the fries back into the bag and then dump them into the fryer. My husband said something to the cashier, (\"did he really just do that?\") and the woman got so pissed. She told him he must not know what he had seen and that the guy definitely threw the fries in the trash, not the fryer. My husband started to dispute it with her but I told him to leave it alone. We didn't order fries anyway and I'm starving. The woman WOULD NOT let it go. She kept going on and on about it even though we said it was fine and we just wanted our food. Even though we were there after the time they said it would be done the woman said with a smirk that it wasn't ready yet. We sat down in the dining area and waited ANOTHER 20 minutes. I finally go to ask the same woman how much longer it would be. She ignores me the first time and the second time I said something she just told me give her a minute and went on ignoring me. I sat back down and waited another 10 minutes before I finally asked her as she walked by if she had time to talk to me yet. She looked at me blankly. I said, \"When. Will. My. Food. Be. Done.\" She smiled condescendingly and said \"10 more minutes\" she was obviously very pleased with herself. I told her to keep that shit, got my money back and left. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, but service was not great! They had one cook and one waitress, we waited over 30 mins for garlic knots. Prices ok, but dont think I will go back."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but that is where the 2 stars comes in.  Now here comes the complaints: the ice maker was jamming and the waitress crammed her fingers in the nozzle to get the ice out and put that ice into our cups.  GROSS.  Secondly, they served us 2 orders of hard/raw potato skins and instead of them removing it from the bill they only took 10% off the order.  Note: Tax in LV is 8.1% so there was no big discount there.  The cheesecake must have been uncovered because it had an aftertaste that was disgusting.  Father's day dinner was ruined and over 50 bucks for a disgusting meal.  I used to love Monte's but we will never go back."}
{"text":"Good pizza and friendly service! Seems yelp has a liar problem,  lots of fake hit reviews! This is good pizza and it always gets delivered on time! Very clean inside as well. I'm calling you liars. I said it"}
{"text":"This place was horrific.  I called them at 6:30 and placed our order and we were told 45 minutes but after an hour  and 15 past they still didn't get here with our food7 when1 1/2 hour to deliver 2 soggy phily steak sandwich and 2 small undercooked fries.  I called them and they did nothing for us."}
{"text":"I have been searching for good pizza in nlv for a while now with no success until I discovered this place. So far had pizza garlic knots and wings, my only complaint was the wings they were not crispy enough but good size, pizza is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Horrible place took 40 minutes to get our food and we dined in !!!! Manager sucks and the crew obviously doesn't know how to cook I was about to jump over the counter and offer my assistance as I work in a casino and I am a cook as well I could have cooked my own order hahaha bad place overall"}
{"text":"Tried it out for the first time today and neither my husband nor myself were impressed. His pizza was reheated and not that good. The garlic knots didn't taste fresh. My pasta was just plain and had no flavor. Would have been happier eating at home, won't return."}
{"text":"Not worth the troubles. Waited TWO hours for a delivery. Finally had to cancel the order. There just is no reason for a pizza delivery place in the Las Vegas Valley to take that long to make pizza and deliver it. There are plenty of other places to get a pizza delivered. Steer clear of Monte's Pizza Restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for this place, the delivery was pretty quick but dang was I disappointed! The pasta we ordered did not come with the meatballs that we ordered, the garlic bread was hard, and the sauce was just a thick layer over the pasta! The burger we ordered was just cold, and the bun was just so hard it ruined the whole thing. The fries were also soggy, and had no seasoning. The only reason this place didn't get a one star is because the chicken fingers were pretty good, and so was the cheesecake. Nonetheless this place isn't good and I don't plan on going soon."}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:15am, pizzeria not even open. The sign on door says open at \"11am\", but there's not a soul in sight. Get it together Monte. Someone get out of bed and open up the pizzeria. Based on the other reviews, it's probably better that this place is closed right now."}
{"text":"Awful, awful Awful! Watered down sauce.  Ordered spaghetti and meatballs. The meat balls were of the frozen kind, they probably got in the frozen section of walamrt. Sauce was watered down and nasty, spaghetti tasted like it has been made days ago and just had the sauce poured on it.   For what was paid it was the size of a 1/2 order and 3 teeny little meatballs. But the garlic knots were  ok.  Let's not forget the flat soda.  I will never, ever order from this place again. Far from Italian.  This was the worst 1st impression ever!"}
{"text":"We are regulars, ordering from David Montes usually about 2-3 times a month.  I normally order take out and get pepperoni pizza along with their spaghetti and chicken fingers. Everything is homemade and always fresh.   I always pick up as I don't like delivery service from any establishment so I can't speak to their delivery service.   Table service has been prompt the two times I have eaten at the restaurant and customer service has been friendly."}
{"text":"My friend and I just ordered Montes for delivery. Based on the reviews I was hesitant but they are dead on.We ordered a burger and pasta. Fries were cold! THE BEST PART ABOUT IT. We ordered a piece of cheesecake too.  The Delievery man forgot it and went back to get it. Instead of going to the restaurant and getting it he went to CARLS JR. AND GOT IT!!! The Carl's Jr. Is the same distance as Montes from my house. The lady on the phone didn't apologize until I mentioned yelp the tone in her voice changed. When the driver came back I asked where the side of ranch was and he said I don't pack the orders and ran off!! This place sucks!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our pizza was served hot and delicious! We didn't have to wait long to get our food, either. The wait staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. Thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end. Thanks, Monte's for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Zero stars. Ordered delivery today and after an hour and a half of waiting we called to see what was up. No answer. After two hours we decided to drive down to the storefront and no one was there! Their business hours state that they're open, however all the lights were off and doors were locked. Possibly a blessing in disguise, but now we are hangry."}
{"text":"Their garlic knots are pretty good. The pizza that they have sitting out doesn't look that good. I have tried their pizza and it's ok. But I plan on trying some of the other things in their menu besides pizza."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 star review I would. Let me start by saying the pizza isn't that bad and the garlic knots are pretty good but that's about it for the positive remarks...this place was SO bad that they took about 15-20 minutes (not exaggerating) to get the drinks and not a SINGLE refill was delivered by them, (I actually got my entire tables refills the whole time we were there) and the pizza took every bit of 45 minutes to get to us and before you ask it was not busy at all...us and 2 other tables doesn't constitute that long of a wait for 2 pizzas and a calzone. Oh and one more thing to add 2 different groups walked out waiting for their to-go orders while we waited for our order because they felt the wait was too long.   So in short save your money and just go eat at ANY other place unless you're ok with waiting 30+minutes for a mediocre pizza at best."}
{"text":"Love this place and the bar it is in cook and owners are great, Tennessee the order taker is awesome can take a joke as well as can give it. The food is good it is the best I have had in a bar ribs here are great the soup tho needs work however if you are at the bar ordering soup go home your sick lol come give it a shot you don't like it call the owners they will make it right by you. I have sat and talk with them are honest people who want to put out a good product."}
{"text":"I ordered 2.5 hours before they closed. They never delivered my food, but still charged my debit card. Not very happy & still hungry."}
{"text":"Not sure why others are so rough on the place, but I usually pick up or dine in on the large one topping pizza for $7.95. The pizza is a good quality and the staff is always pleasant. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Every time I order there is a wait, but it is well worth it. Being from NYC I love the fact Monte 's is doing justice for NY style pizza. It looks great, smells great, and taste even better. An added benefit is their giant pizza. I will always order from this pizzeria and no other. Thank you for your delicious pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and ordered two cheese steak sandwiches and an order of cheese sticks.  Both of the sandwiches were wrong and AWEFUL .  We got completely different orders!! I'll never eat from this place again"}
{"text":"I love the food.  I got the chicken and beef  kebab, and it was fresh and delicious.  It took a few minutes, but you can't rush good food!  Have to try the pizza next :)"}
{"text":"How long does it take to make a bacon cheese burger?! Well let's just say I've been sitting here for 20 minutes and my boyfriends burger is not ready. Doesn't hurt for the people around here to smile either"}
{"text":"Some friends and I placed a large order for delivery. The food arrived in about an hour (we were quoted 45 to 60 minutes, so this was acceptable). Unfortunately when our order arrived it was incorrect. When we called and told them our order was incorrect we were told it would take at least 90 minutes to receive a corrected order, and that we could complain to the manager if we wanted. On top of the poor service the food was poor quality (wings were undercooked, the tiramisu was frozen in the center, the fish portion of the fish and chips were bland). Overall, I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The driver was nice, however, the outcome of the experience reached back into the recesses of my brain and made me remember why I haven't ordered there in almost a year. I ordered the extra large pizza with 3 toppings plus the appetizer combo and a side of the chocolate mousse cake to split with my boyfriend. They forgot the appetizer and they offered the discount for next time or to return the driver with the appetizers. That was about an hour and a half ago when they said they would return the driver. Still waiting and can only expect them to arrive cold as hell unless they refried the apps. The pizza is ok. It's better than Aurelio's by a long shot but that still is not saying anything good about this place. I will never order from here again. Worst service. Pizza is only good when it's cold but so is Little Caesars pizza which is cheaper and tastes better than this place.  Post edit-  It's 6:36pm and still no one has come by. I feel really bad for the driver as it seems he's the only one hey have but since it's not my business it shouldn't have to be my problem. They should not have delivery if they can't handle the volume.  Post post edit- It's currently 8pm. I called them about 30 minutes ago asking for a refund of the combo appetizers. The girl I talked to sounded surprised the driver was not there yet. She said they will refund the appetizers so I will make sure the refund is there on my next billing statement. Sigh. What a pain."}
{"text":"First, the lady with bangs was super rude. Second, their plates were disgustingly dirty. Had them sent back and she said \"I'll tell them to wash it better\". Should've checked before even giving it to my table. Wasn't a great server at all. Find a new job.   The quality of the food is just ok. It wasn't warm when served. I doubt I would come back.   2-stars just cause I'm a nice person  They really deserve 1-star."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Took an hour and 1/2 and I ask for napkins and they have me 1. Ordered 3 entrees and received 1 napkin. Really???  Wings require a lot of napkins. HELLO!!!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be a fan of the restaurant. The last couple of orders have been incorrect. My previous positive experiences lead me to order again, but was wrong and I will make sure to never, ever order from this ungrateful, highly unprofessional business, and nobody is to blame except for the owner. When I called to ask about the misunderstanding and missing food, I spoke with the \"owner\" and asked to have the food delivered that was missing. He explained that it's busy and he cannot resend the food or even attempt to even apologize. I was also informed that I was wasting his time. When I asked if that's how he typically runs business, he stated \"I guess so\".  Congratulations Mr. Owner. You just lost a long time customer. I sure hope you get what you give out. Sad, just sad and more than unprofessional... Don't believe me?  I am anything but a complainer, but I just received thee worst customer service from the man that runs that ship. You'll see after you get a bad order."}
{"text":"I walked In and stood there for over 5 min calling for someone and ringing their bell but no one came to busy chatting in the back very rude"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Tasty huge pies! Delivery was quick and the driver was a friendly. White pizza was delicious and the deluxe was amazing. We are lucky to have a good local pizza place in the area. Support it!"}
{"text":"Ordered two medium pizzas for delivery and was told they would be delivered in about an hour. We called after 1 hour and 10 minutes and were told the driver had just left with the order. Called again at around 1 hr and 45 minutes in, after placing the order and were told the driver was 'just pulling in to our apartment building ... Well the driver didn't show up until 2 hours after the order was made.   The pizzas were pretty gross. The supreme was cold, greasy and soggy. The toppings and the dough fell right off when a piece was picked up, cold grease dripping and had a cold, rock hard crust. Meanwhile the garlic chicken was cold solid throughout. It honestly looked like a pizza that sat on the counter overnight, the cheese was solid and the chicken and veggies tasted very old.   We called them again and the lady on the phone apologized for the long wait. The order came out to be around $40 bucks for just two medium pizzas. We thought at least a partial refund was in order, but the lady said they wouldn't do that. Instead she said they would only be able to give us a 20% discount on our next order since our information would stay in their delivery system. That was nice of her, and while she very polite, the future discount seems totally useless since we will not be ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"I am a admitted pizza snob. I am from Pittsburgh originally and I like my east coast style pizza done right or else somebody's gonna hear about it!  Montes.... I have to admit I was a skeptic just based on location alone.. I mean who in their right mind would open a perfect pizza joint in NLV Nevada?!!! Well guess what? Montes did.  We have done the inaugural visit full of skepticism... We have done the second visit of utter disbelief that it could be just as good the second time. We have done the third visit of \"Oh c'mon... lets just really see if they can do it again\". And ya know what?! VIOLA!!!   Time and time again.... Happy! Happy! Happy! I am truly a fan!  Pizza is crunchy where it should be, chewy in the perfect spot, and crispy just in all the right places that make Monte's my new BFF in pizzaville ( or NLV) for life!  I commend the owners on their true attention to quality ( it does not go unnoticed or unappreciated here!), the devotion to the late nighters, and the pure \"Know how\" that makes this pizza NUMERO UNO for me!!! Thank you and halleluiah! Keep it up! I love you guys!!! :)"}
{"text":"I am a supporter of local businesses, and have supported Monte's since they opened because they are down the street, mom and pop, and have an appealing menu, even if it is somewhat limited. Today was a different story, today was the last time I give this place a chance. Ordered baked ziti with added meatballs, hubby ordered the Italian sandwich, 12 bone in wings and tiramisu. Ziti was flavorless, tasted like tomato sauce with cheese, wings were burnt to oblivion and fries that came with it looked and tasted like they'd been in the window for an hour. Tiramisu was frozen solid. The only thing that was half decent was the sandwich. I called them back to speak to a manager and a woman named Julie proceeded to tell me she was going to defend the restaurant and that they cut their desserts while frozen so they get to us perfectly thawed. Not only did she not listen, she did not care that we had a terrible experience. I will not be returning, nor am I willing to waste our hard earned money on a place that is ok with giving sub-standard customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered for the PIzza, cursed them for the diarrhea.  Well, they forgot the appetizers for our order which my girlfriend has already posted about but it did come with free diarrhea which I found out about 1:00 am the next morning.  I thought the Pizza was average although I was doped up on pain killers but when I woke up at 1:00 am sober with my stomach and bowels attempting to make an escape from my body I was forced to re-evaluate.    Also we waited for 3 hours for them to deliver the missing appetizers before we gave up.  I am assuming they never came as we never had another knock or ring at the doorbell.  Avoid this place unless you really want to miss a day of work or you want to bond with your toilet."}
{"text":"Food has almost always been good here.  I think there was only 1 time where we said \"what the heck were they doing while making THIS?\"  My only complaint is the wait time, mainly for delivery.  I live less than a mile away from this place and it took them almost 2 hours to deliver our food. I called and they forgot one of our items, so they had to go back.  It was a large order (pizza, wings, knots and some other stuff), so I was as nice as possible when the delivery lady came, lets face it I was super hungry by that point. We're still going to eat here, I'm just going to continue to call and pick up the order.  Fettuccine Alfredo is bomb & so are the chicken wings (garlic parm...yummy!!), my husband loves the angel hair with meat sauce (I would order extra if you like sauce, they charge $1 extra but it's worth it) & really great garlic knots & fried zucchini sticks too.   I give it 4 stars because of the delivery fiasco, and it's a little on the expensive side, but some of the time I can stretch it for 2 meals so that almost makes up for it.    Overall, they've stepped up their game, and are pumping out some really good food.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.  The food isn't much better either.  Thought I would try a new place since we were sick of pizza. Ordered 2 sides of fries, a sandwich, a burger, 2 chocolate mousse cakes and a two liter of soda.  Total was 37 and some change, which was A little pricey for what I ordered ( in my opinion). Delivery time wasnt too bad like I see some other yelpers had an issue with,  but both the quality of food and customer service was pathetic.  The cheese on both sandwiches wasnt melted and the meat was room temperature. The fries all looked like the overcooked little crispy pieces you find toward the bottom of a McDonald's container and Both cakes were a pile of Mush in the containers they came in. The only item that arrived both completely intact and to my satisfaction was the 2 liter of Soda. I called to complain and was first offered a discount the next time I ordered. I was not interested in ordering ever again so that wasnt good enough. I was then offered to have my order remade and delivered. Uhh, no. So my food can be spit in? I don't think so. After no interest in returning my money I packed everything up and drove down there.  My husband went in to be the muscle, and a few minutes later returned to the car without the money and without the food. He said the lady inside handed him 37.50 and when he told her we tipped and gave the driver an even $40, she said we would have to wait for the driver to return for verification. At that point she realized the order was placed online and tried to take the money back out of my husband's hand. When he wouldn't release it, she threatened to call the police to report a robbery.  ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME! !!?? I asked why and apparently since I ordered online I would have to contact eat24 directly to get a refund. He was told it was because I used a credit card.  Wait.. no I didn't.   I paid cash.  Specifically,  two 10's and a 20.  Irritated,  my husband went back inside and not even 10 seconds later came out with $40. well that seemed Easy enough, What'd she say? Sorry. Seriously ? Sorry?  After all that,  just sorry?  I will never be ordering from this place again and based on my experience and others,  I don't think too many people would recommend it either.   To the girl at the register,  You have a lot of nerve threatening to call the cops on a customer because you were fucking up.  Unbelievable.   Don't bother ordering from here,  Find something else.. anything."}
{"text":"GroupOn mislead us into believing this was an actual Italian restaurant. It's a bar. It's actually a seedy bar. The tables are in the very back and there's no wait staff.   Surprisingly the food was really good. It did take forever to get, but still good. We had pizza, ziti, fingers & fries.  So locale is questionable, but the food is decent."}
{"text":"First time I ordered from this place about five months ago the food was great delivery was fast and the food was hot tried the next time Everything Has Changed including the taste of the food just tried it one more time the pizza was cold and the pasta was lukewarm I will not be ordering from them again"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night. Called my order in chicken Alfredo when I got their she gave me my order when I looked at it I told her their was no chicken she looked at me with dead stair and said this is what you ordered I replied no I ask for chicken Alfredo so she rolled her eyes and fixed the order. The food on another hand was good. Don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"First and LAST time here folks!!! If I have to explain these photos of a German Cockroach to change your mind, then listen to this, I came in I ordered, I ate, on the way out I spotted those little disease carrying bastards!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place ONE star for the following reasons; first off the order took an hour and a half to be delivered. When we received our order, it was wrong. We paid extra for the thick crust on our pizza and also pepperoni. What we actually got was a PLAIN, COLD, cheese pizza that was thin and had obviously been sitting for a long time. We also ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich. My husband is highly allergic to onions so we specified NO ONIONS on the sandwich, and what did it come with? ONIONS!!! After waiting an hour and a half for our order which was WRONG, obviously we were pretty irritated. We called them right away and got no answer. So we waited until the next day to call and complain. I can think of about fifty other things I'd rather spend $30 on than the horrible \"meal\" we received from this place. We spoke to Ray who identified himself as the owner and were casually dismissed and he told us he had to talk to the employees who worked the night before and blah blah and he said to call back tomorrow. He was rude and completely dismissed the situation. We will NEVER order from them again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. They have a diverse menu. Good food. Service was good though it wasn't a busy day.  We both liked it and would come back again."}
{"text":"Wow,  your the only one that delivers up to 3pm? I wish there were other choices. I'm so disappointed in your food.  Please don't brag about it being homemade. Our pizza was burnt, had to play connect the sauce to taste it and your rendition of hot wings and plain wings my dog wouldn't even touch it.  What a waste of my hard earn dollars! First time having that crap delivered and the last time. One star for the driver who still got a tip. I really wanted to call and rant but was tired because I had to still cook after spending $86."}
{"text":"Horrible delivery service... not only did it take them an hour and half but they screwed up my order.  Not worth the wait.  very disappointed."}
{"text":"First of all their food is nasty. The meat on their pizzas has a pungent rotten scent and flavor. They also deliver food over an hour later than the time they state they will deliver by. I am going to stay far away from Monte's Pizza."}
{"text":"We thought that when the name changed they may have also improved the quality of the food, but we were wrong. It really is not worth going again. Best thing is the fact that they are open late. But McDonald's is too so you may as well go there. Better food and way cheaper."}
{"text":"I ordered off eat 24 about an hour before closing. The delivery guy was 20 minutes early and the was ridiculously hot. Definitely impressed."}
{"text":"Horrible  and the customer service bad as well don't waste ur time. The Russian lady as well as the lady with bangs were very unprofessional"}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone is complaining...our experience was great. We ordered a HUGE (24 inch) pepperoni pizza. Didn't take long at all and the staff was super nice and helpful. The crust was really good and there wasn't too much cheese. Everyone liked it so much we ordered again today."}
{"text":"This place has terrible service and crap food.  Order a pizza for delivery and am told it will be 45 minutes.  An hour and a half later the driver shows up with a cold pizza.  I call to complain and their offer is, we will give you a discount on the next one.  And why would I want to try a Next one?  Too bad they spend money for advertising, because they are not where you want to order from."}
{"text":"I ordered on grubhub, the food showed up almost 40 mins after it was supposed to arrive. The fries were cold, pizza was ok the chicken wings looked like they were prepared by a blind butcher, over cooked to the point that what meat was on it was jerky. I will never order here again! Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"The real deal New York style..waoooo!  Great pizza and garlic knots.  Though this place is very hidden. But a GEM no less!  You should try it youll be very surprised!"}
{"text":"After seeing the two star rating on Yelp, I have to admit that I was a little apprehensive about eating at Monte's. But we were in the area and needed some fast food,  so what the heck, why not? We were greeted when we walked in and asked to sit wherever we wanted.  The place was dead; most people coming in were ordering to-go.   Our waitress was meek and soft spoken,  but she was on point for refills.  My husband and brother-in-law guzzled down at least 4 cokes a piece.  I took advantage of the Yelp check in offer and got 12 garlic knots for free! They came out after 10 minutes and were promptly demolished.  The knots were served up hot and loaded with garlic and parmesan cheese.   We all ordered from the \"specials\" menu. I ordered a slice of cheese pizza with a side of garlic knots ($3.99). It was $0.50 extra to add mushrooms.  My husband got the same special but with pepperoni.  The brother-in-law ordered a large pepperoni pizza ($7.99). When the food came out,  it was seriously right off the oven. The pizzas had the perfect amount of cheese.  Our grand total for two people?  $11.32!!   When all is said and done, the only major complaint I had was that it took just under 30 minutes to get our meals. Under normal circumstances we wouldn't have minded but it just so happened we were in a rush. We ordered pizzas and garlic knots- not anything crazy like a time consuming calzone. Even so, the wait time still doesn't affect my choice of a four star rating because the service was great, the food was good,  and the prices phenomenal. We'll be returning to Monte's!"}
{"text":"worst customer service plz hit me up before you even DARE try this out i promise nothing but an Attitude and wrong order and being on hold for more the 3times. i seriously regret ever having a meal from this terrible place. there pizza was thin then ever and cheese slid off before eating and no joke i tired sooooooooooooo hard to just try them out but nope i will never ever try again so plz someone where is there a 24hr pizza delivery place? heres my facebook ill call them with you on the line and show you how much they suck."}
{"text":"I eat at Montes pizza many times and I am all ways order new from there menu. Most of the time I spend at Nellis location inside INN ZONE bar playing eating and having fun I love there service garls are nice tasty food what do I need more but my wife came to visit me and she is not in to bar think so she asked me where to go eat so I know Montes have nice location at north las Vegas so we go there and have same family time. Lats make it short I dont know who'd writing what about this is my opinion I love there food  and you guys do what you doing just don't stop and open more locations so we can have tasty food around us"}
{"text":"Hi I like to thank all workers at this location you Gus doing good jab I will see you next time I will be in Vegas and that will be next week I rally have good time playing drinking and eat so thank you and seeyaaa"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch. We both ordered the Philly cheese steak. It started out good until I was stuck in the cheek by a twist tie in my sandwich! Yes a twist tie with paper on it! Man what a way to end your lunch. This was the first time there and it will be the last. Sorry I have to give them 0 stars."}
{"text":"How Monte's has fallen. I don't know if it's new management or the business is just losing money but what a bad food experience.  I came in while my friends went to the place next door. I figured a Philly cheese steak was in order. The lady was friendly however now the problem's begin. They say it should be about 15 minutes which is no problem. I'm waiting and then I see her get my sprite. She said they have fountain but I watched them use a 2 liter which was already open so of course that means it's probably going to be flat. She puts the soda on standby and a little bit later comes the food. I am already a little peeved about the drink. If you want to save money use the cans at least they stay carbonated.   Finally the food comes out. I go outside and sit to eat. Open the wrap and can see it's hot which I'm happy then I take a bite. Not enough cheese and the meat was bland. The fries were not better. So I'm stuck with a flat soda, bland sandwich, and fries that were nothing special.  I went back in and let the girl know I wanted to speak to a manager but they weren't there. She apologized and said she would pass it along to the manager.  Sorry Monte's but I will not be returning. I hope they can turn it around.  If you go to Monte's I would stick with their pizza as that seems all the reviews that are good say is ok."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time for delivery the other night.  We ordered pizza and wings with fries.  They said delivery would be about 45 minutes, after an hour I called and they said they were finishing the order.  Another 45 minutes went by and I called again, this time it was on its way.  So we finally received our order after 2 hours of first calling.  Totally unacceptable!  Our neighbors wanted to try this place so we dined in and gave it another shot.  We decided to eat outside since it was so nice.  The tables were disgusting, they don't clean them apparently.  We had some cheese sticks first which were not cooked enough.  My mom ordered spaghetti and meatballs which was all water on the bottom of the plate and did not taste good.  I had an Italian sub which was gross!  It had some weird after taste.  It took 2 hours to complete our experience there.  In the meantime, 2 couples walked out because it was taking so long.  The waitress smelled of alcohol.  Just a complete mess at this place!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!  They do not offer to take any food off of your bill either.  I am not sure why they are still open, I am betting they won't be for long."}
{"text":"This review can go two ways:  the food & everything else.  The bad: One problem is the place is so plain.  No culture.  No ambience.  Just tables, chairs, & a few TVs for the patrons.  But if you're taking it to go, you won't care anyway.  The service was just ok.  It took forever to get our drinks.  When I asked what the holdup was, I was told the ice machine.  But once the drinks finally arrived, everything else started flowing.  Again, the wait to go was typical as long as you stay away from the ice machine!  The good: The food.  Typical NY pizza...and while it's not the best I've had, it's still better than say, Bambini's.  The garlic knots were well seasoned. My wife had chicken wings.  They looked plump, and she thought they were good. The salads were basic.  I'd expect artichokes in an Antipasta salad, for example.  The price:  Overall, the prices looked competitive.  They offer plenty of specials to help save some cash.  All in all, taking the food to go will save some of these headaches & enjoy some decent food."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that we've ordered from here a few times before and we've never had an issue, however, we've always picked up the pizza, never had delivery before. I order online for the first time and set it up for delivery. When I finished, the email said it would be a 65 minute wait. Well being pregnant and very hungry, I did not want to wait. I called the store and asked if I could pick it up instead because I live close by. The young girl on the phone said that it would be fine to pick it up and it would be 25 minutes. We arrived about 20 minutes later to pick it up and we were informed that it was already out for delivery. We were a little frustrated but said okay. We made it home in about 3 minutes and the pizza had not yet arrived. I called the store and she informed me that the driver had one other delivery and that he'd be there soon. I waited another 15 minutes and called the store again. I spoke with a man and he made contact with the driver and said it would be 5 minutes. The driver did show up 5 minutes later with a pizza. Well, we also ordered garlic knots, garlic bread, fingers and fries!! The driver had no idea that he was supposed to get the other stuff. I immediately called the store and the young woman said, \"yea, the other food is here\". What the?? I had already called 2 times and not once did they say that the other food was left behind. So this has now been over an hour since we ordered and all our food wasn't even delivered. The girl put the man back on the phone and I tried to explain the situation, the male pig decided to tell me, \"before you even talk, listen to me...\". Are you kidding me? My husband then got upset and told the driver to forget the whole thing. I hung up on the jerk on the phone and that was it. I never got an apology or a phone call back trying to keep my business. I am absolutely appalled by the service we received. No one seemed to care. So here I am, many hours later, still hungry."}
{"text":"Our food delivery never showed up. I contacted the manager who basically said that was too bad and he didn't care. We waited two hours before ordering from somewhere else. We never cancelled the order and it never arrived."}
{"text":"hey, i was here last week with friends and we liked the food, yes it took a little longer to get our food but not to long what they told us, so ill go there for sure, i hope i wont be disappointed"}
