{"text":"Went here last week with my brother, sister-in-law, and husband. We stopped by the MGM Grand food court for breakfast and all settled on trying their breakfast burritos. WORST DECISION EVER! The eggs were watery, they put way too much sour cream on it. The bacon was kind of tasteless. They wanted to charge 3.00 extra for potatoes. It ran us total over 50 dollars and none of us could finish it. It was that gross. We honestly should have just ate at McDonalds and saved a few bucks. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and priced a bit high. Reminded me of a Chipotle Grill but more expensive and not nearly as fresh tasting."}
{"text":"They have hair in their food and when you take it back they become rude and start speaking to each other in Spanish.  I could tell they were talking about me Spanish.  If you're going to be rude, at least do it after I leave, not in front of me.   Terrible customer service!!!  Don't eat here!!!  They offered to replace my food but honestly, why would I want to eat the stuff that the hair was in.  No way!!!  Again, don't eat here!!!  Hair in food and they're RUDE!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly personnel, good food."}
{"text":"Been staying here here for over a week (MGM) and this was a welcome change from $20 burgers or $50 steaks. The taco salad is massive, pork was shredded and tender, the food tastes great! Brought mine back to our room and am enjoying with a Chelada! 

Don't even bother with the Rita's, this place is all about the food!"}
{"text":"The food was good for the price. The burritos were our favorite, and the margaritas were great. Three flavors available: Mango, strawberry and margarita. They are refreshing to drink along the strip. On certain days they are half price, just have to ask."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!! Love the favors and the deals!!! Luv the tacos!!!!"}
{"text":"3 tacos and a drink for $19.87. Too expensive, but I guess that's just Vegas nowadays. The food was good. Fresh. And the staff was organized and really got us all in and out quickly. The guacamole was fresh and delish."}
{"text":"The service is great the staff are wonderful food was 100% enjoyable, my family will always makes this one of or stops when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First, the margarita deal via Groupon was a rip-off. They come out of a frozen drink machine, not hand made by any bartender! And very sugary with hardly any alcohol in them. Like a 7-11 slurpee! I ended up giving it away to someone in the street! The bummer was it took forever to even FIND the place -- walking in circles for almost an 45 minutes! With Venetian staff having NO clue where it was either. And the security guard had an idea but note: the Food Court (where it is) is NOT the same as restaurant row! So after 45 minutes of walking in circles ALL I wanted in the world was to down a huge margarita and it didn't happen. Next, the service....barely existed. The girls were not exactly friendly or welcoming, it was a bit disorganized and slow. Lastly, and their saving grace to not getting 1 star...is the food was surprisingly pretty good! We got burritos bowls -- one meat and one tofu! That was a plus, being a vegetarian, yay! there was something I could eat. It's NOT Chipotle but the food is good...definitely overpriced tho. Therefore, IF you find it, don't fall for margarita deal just get food...or save yourself, relax & sit down and eat at one of the many awesome restaurants in Venetian, not here."}
{"text":"This place is located in the food court to let everyone know.  I checked in here & got the 44 oz margarita for $9 and u can taste the booze.  They use Cuervo it's my favorite.  I got 2 tacos and my wife got a taco bowl.  It's good not great it's moe's or chipotle in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Over priced and everything costs extra. I ordered 2 enchiladas for $10 plus $1 for sour cream and I decided I couldn't afford the guacamole.  I asked for a side of chips - $5?! No thanks. The manager (older Hispanic man) was aware of my request for a small side of chips and pretended not to see or hear me.

For a food court, not a good deal. On a more positive note, the food tastes good.
Older Caucasian woman was the only nice server.  Ugh!"}
{"text":"Inside the MGM at the food court. I didn't notice it walking in from certain side of the food court since it was angled off. But passing by a second time from the pool, I knew I had to have a bit here. Huge fan of tacos! And this place was super! I was very surprised given that it was food court food. But a surprising delight to have in my hotel. This was at least one meal a day for me out of the four days we stayed. I just kept coming back for more!

Everything was made to order. I always got the three taco plate which came with three tacos in house made tortillas, filled with your choice of meat (each taco can have a different meat as well for variety). You had your choice of filling as well, from cheese to lettuce, salsa, etc. I always got the steak as one, and other times chose from the other meats every time just to see what they tasted like. All were very good, especially the sweet pulled pork. They also have burritos as well. 

Highly recommended! As I'm writing this review, I am craving more of their tacos now! So please get tacos and eat some for me since I'm back home in Colorado!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place was how they fold the tacos in foil, that's  why they get a star at all! The worse food, could not even take a second bite. We ordered 3 tacos, barracuda was so sweet, did they accidentally put sugar instead of salt? And still served it?, rice, was so under cooked it was crunchy ugh! and beans, and a burrito. I didn't taste the burrito but was told it had zero flavor. I would think being located in the Venetian would require at least a eatable standard. Terrible! very disappointed to over pay for food that couldn't be eaten. Please replace with a real Chipotle"}
{"text":"Great, fresh food. Amazing flavors.

After day drinking, this place really hit the spot. Its casual, no frills, but well worth every penny."}
{"text":"Food ok good, nothing to write home about. Customer service needs great improvement. Our encounter with Shelia was disappointing and will keep us from returning. She was rude, appeared to be inconvenienced, and kept looking at the menu like I was ordering things that don't exist ( side of beans and rice ). Management needs to reeducate her on basic customer service."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money.  Horrible, over priced food! I ordered the steak(ok) burrito, with black beans (bland), lime rice(awful awful awful), and cheese. There is a $1 upcharge for a spoonful of regular salsa. (That's like charging $1 for ketchup when you order fries) The margaritas are a joke, I don't think there was any alcohol in ours. I can't believe this horrible place is located in the MGM Grand."}
{"text":"Tasteful Mexican fast food. I'm in Vegas once a month for business and I always stay at MGM. This new restaurant is really tasteful and the service makes it better. Fast, good service and nice people working there. This restaurant came to complete the food court out there. Really satisfied !!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went the to get the 44oz margarita's since we're in town to do a bit of the tourist thing. Service was slow to get our drinks and while the drinks tasted good they were beyond weak. Neither me or my wife had any effect from the alcohol we are not big drinkers with tolerances either. The souvenir glasses are cool but the drink quality was disappointing."}
{"text":"The morning crew (Nella, Carmen and Jubille) at this MGM food court stop were great. Pleasant and nice. Food was awesome too."}
{"text":"We got the Groupon for the 2 for 1 giant margaritas and ended up getting food too. The service was great, the employees were incredibly friendly, and the food is AWESOME.  definitely a spot we plan on hitting next time we go back."}
{"text":"It was awesome, Joanna was happy to give me a military discount and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Just visited and ordered a taco salad and burrito bowl. I have a wheat sensitivity, so when I realized the taco salad was in a wheat and not corn shell, I asked for a little more rice(the scoop was barely ANYTHING.) I was told it was be $2 extra for more rice. Fine. Two other employees by the register made comments and rolled their eyes. My boyfriend was already at the register and saw and heard them. The person who made the food and the two employees by the register were all unfriendly and rude to us. You don't blatantly be rude to your customers like that. I've worked in the food industry and I never treated customers that way."}
{"text":"This is now my FAVORITE place for quick food on the strip. The taco salad is very easily enough food for two people for $11.00. The sweet pork is AMAZING. I mean it - and I live in Texas. I know Tex-Mex. This was so good that I turned down a couple of buffets to go back to it. Since it is such large portions, and they are carb-heavy, they make for terrific hangover-prevention. (Along with plenty of water!) Easily one of my favorite food memories, I sincerely hope that this place is still open when we make another Vegas trip next summer!!!"}
{"text":"THE LOWDOWN: 
MEH. KEEP LOOKING ELSEWHERE IN THE MGM FOOD COURT
We were about to get on a plane in a few hours and wanted to get something fast and fairly healthy to eat. We saw Tacos N' Ritas at the MGM Food Court and decided to give it a try. We figured it was a welcome change from the $50-$60 lunches for two that my husband and I had been having in Vegas for the past several days. And we were hungry!

WHAT *NOT* TO ORDER - CHICKEN BURRITO BOWL $11
I love burrito bowls and I have them whenever I can, especially since I'm trying to maintain more of a clean eating diet. I also love to add guacamole in my burrito bowls. 

With my first few bites, I knew this was not anything at all like I was hoping for. The chicken was flavorless and dry. The guacamole tasted kind of sour! The salsa didn't really add any flavor at all. All in all THIS MEAL MADE ME SAD. Why? Because I was hungry and it was my last meal in Vegas. We should've just sprung for another expensive meal and left with a bang. ;) I mean, how can you get a chicken burrito bowl wrong? Well, they got this bowl Wrong for my order. I didn't even eat all of it because I didn't like my meal and I was hungry! My husband chose the steak burrito ($11), which at least tasted acceptable. 

SERVICE: Lackluster. Nothing remarkable to say about the customer service. It was more akin to a cafeteria-type of setting of doling out the food. It could have been friendlier. 

RESULT: Do not get the chicken bowl. If you want good Mexican food, this is not the place. You're better off going somewhere else in the food court for cheap eats or walking elsewhere down the MGM Promenade to a pricier joint."}
{"text":"We stopped here for the Groupon frozen margarita special. Guy had no problem working the groupon and they were way more flavorful than i expected. I couldn't hardly taste the alcohol though. 

Especially if it's a hot day in a vegas and you want something cool to drink grab this it's such a deal!

Friendly employees but the actual food court within mgm is sort of hard to find lots of loops just stop and ask an employee and save yourself about 5 min of wondering lol"}
{"text":"Chipotle style set up just with booze.  Really good food and the 9$ margarita deal on Yelp is awesome.  They were pretty strong too"}
{"text":"This was not what I expected for \"Mexican\" food. The pork was very sweet and did not taste the way carnitas should. The taco bowl was not toasted for me, but was toasted for the customer before me. The service was inconsistent and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Every time I'm at MGM I stop at this place! 
The crew is very friendly and the food is delicious. Their Burrito enchilada style is the best!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian isn't always easy when you are at a tourist spot like Vegas and pretty much staying the whole time inside the MGM Signature compound. I found out that Tacos N' Ritas has a veggie option. Who knew? Not me. Anyway, my husband and I went to check it out. He had gotten a burrito there the day before and said it was good and about $12. So, off we went. I ordered and answered the questions of wanting this that and the other thing. I added chips and a drink, got my food and went to sit down to eat. When my husband came to join me after paying for my veggie burrito he said, \"what veggies did you order that made that a $25 burrito?\". I was shocked, wow a $25 burrito...yikes. Oh well, it was really good and I actually ate it over the course of 3 days (it was huge), so if you dollar cost average it out, it was a deal. Good food, just be aware of the cost of all the options."}
{"text":"Simply I just like the food and service better here than in the Food Court in the Grand Canal Shoppes. The portions are bigger, their Sweet Pork barbacoa is on point and with the GCS employee discount $10 bucks for everything. If it wasn't for my friend I probably be paying more money at the Chipotle for half the quantity of food I am getting here."}
{"text":"Terrible. Every single person in line was pissed and complaining. Since this is Chipotle style service, why not finish up one order before jumping to the next? The girl was so rude when another customer told her to remake the quessadilla that had been sitting there cold for 15min already. Not to mention, it was burned. Our food took forever and she rushed through the order. It too was cold when we actually sat down to eat. The tortilla was already soggy. And damn the steak was nasty. Chewy, Beef jerk like meat that had more fat and tendons than anything."}
{"text":"So we read a lot of reviews saying that their portions are huge and 'two people can share' or 'there is no way you will leave hungry', but now I know that is totally not true. I am a small girl (~115lbs) and even I could have eaten 2 burrito bowls. We were hungry from walking around and really disappointed about how small their portions are. They served us a burrito bowl in a container made for small side salads. We would have ordered their burritos instead of the burrito bowls but tortillas are also made using lard (gross) instead of other healthier options. If you have been walking a lot and are actually hungry, your $12 would be better spent somewhere else."}
{"text":"Like many other reviewers, I purchased the Groupon for the margaritas.  I read the reviews before visiting the Venetian location so I was not surprised at all that the drinks didn't taste as if they had any alcohol in them.  We paid $5 for an extra shot and then they actually tasted like a margarita.  The price was still fair with the extra $5, however, I do feel there is some level of dishonesty here as you really don't get what you are expecting.  In addition, the staff seemed as if they had better things to do than to wait on us.  I wouldn't say there unpleasant - more disinterested and not engaged."}
{"text":"Well seasoned and abundant Tex-Mex conveniently located in the tony MGM Grand Food Court.

A plethora of choices but not overkill. Service was fast. Great toppings selection."}
{"text":"Price,  but I would say good food. One Chivken Burrito $ 15.00 The girl who's serve us was pretty Nice. Similar to Chipotle, if you can find a closer Chipotle go for. :-)"}
{"text":"Located in the food court of the Venetian I selected this place because it seemed like one of the few gluten free options for a cheaper lunch.  I got the two taco plate.  They let me get all rice instead of rice and beans.  My chicken taco had super dry chicken, I hardly ate it.  The pork was good but weirdly sweet... Although they warned me of this.  The rice was good, it had a cilantro and lemon taste to it.  Something in my plate was oddly spicy, probably due to being stored next to all the salsa.  A risk one takes when ordering from the two of restaurant that displays all the food next to each other but it was a bummer.  I spent about $14 just for the plate, no drink or anything else.  They also had burritos and burgers.  It's not much cheaper of an option so I probably will not be back."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the coupon code for a44oz margarita for $9 on this website did not work.  They told me they couldn't give me that discount. I felt ripped off because it is advertised right here on Yelp."}
{"text":"This was certainly different thats for sure, I actually want to rate this a 3 1/2 stars but what the hell, the food is good very authentic very freshly made, i never tried this defanitely was worth it, though i was not that indulged by the beans and the rice, the soft tacos with the fresh guacomoli was heaven."}
{"text":"Tortillas are handmade. Meats are flavorful. Normally not worth 4 stars but when compared to chicken tenders, soggy Chinese or the other offerings in this food court, I can be generous."}
{"text":"MGM has a fairly sad food court, but this place was awesome. You can actually see them making the tortillas fresh in front of you -- definitely wasn't expecting that.

The nachos with steak were a perfect snack. It was a really large portion (and they don't skimp on the meat and cheese, either) -- perfect to tide two people over for a few hours.

The nachos come with your choice of meat, plus cheese, which all goes under the salamander to get hot and yummy. Then they add salsa, sour cream and guac. This place does nachos right -- the salsa had the perfect amount of heat and flavor. The guac was good, and the nachos were some of the best-constructed nachos I've had (and I'm from LA where awesome Mexican places abound).

This place is so much better than any of the other food court options."}
{"text":"Great place to get margaritas. The Groupon for this place is worth it and when you check in on Yelp you get a 44oz margarita for $9. The food is nothing special, good and not that expensive. I got the enchiladas and the mild salsa was delicious but my friend got the taco and the tortilla immediately fell apart. Overall would definitely go for the drinks."}
{"text":"Horrible Custmer service from the Ass-sant manager. She is horrible to all that were waiting line.  She never made eye contact. She yelled for the NEXT CUSTOMER. never once looked up just kept ask what what what do you want. We will never go to this Rita Tacos. The food had no flavor. Just like their service."}
{"text":"I hate wet burritos. It totally defeats the point of a burrito. They insisted on running my unfinished burrito through an oven and then informed me they couldn't add anything else to it unless they put it on top. Forget that, I almost just walked away. I regretted not doing so once I found out my crappy chicken, rice and cheese only burrito was going to cost me $12."}
{"text":"Decent, but not amazing Mexican fare that's a good choice if you need to scarf down some food before a show, like \"KA\" or something. Not super flavorful, but it hit the spot at the time.

Because it's Vegas it is not a cheap joint, and I think my server was either practicing for his upcoming audition for \"Young Cheech and Chong\" or...he wasn't actually acting at all. Either way he made a decent steak quesadilla (one of my food groups) and wasn't skimpy on the sour cream, either. Many restaurants hoard sour cream like it's only secreted by stingy unicorns; here I had more than enough for my 'dilla."}
{"text":"Taco Ritas now for a gigantic drink for your money this is a must stop.. I brought a Groupon think 2 for 20 it was worth it. you can mix the flavor and walk around their beautiful hotel all day. This drink last me half of my day it a 48oz. Margarita in a souvenir glass to take home. The location inside the hotel is also right by the slot machines"}
{"text":"Yelp offer sounded too good to be true so I had to stop by and see for myself. Turns out it's valid! You get a 44oz drink for $9. Got a strawberry margarita. Tasty and strong. Perfect for when walking along the strip. You'd be crazy not to stop by and get one! Definitely a must if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"We love this place! We had tacos about 4 times within 24 hours and we are as happy as clams. We will be back on our next Vegas trip. Thanks for a great food experience!"}
{"text":"I just wanted beans in my taco instead of the side and the lady told me it was $1extra. Instead of the green mild sauce I wanted the red mild and it was $1 extra. Ridiculous!!!! The acted like I was inconveniencing her.  Terrible customer service. Ps this was not a midnight snack this was at 230 in the afternoon."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for 24 oz margaritas which was awesome until we drank them and felt nothing. I don't think there was even a shot of tequila in there. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Had a great experience even though I read a couple of reviews I decided to try it out and make up my own mind. I got the beef tacos and a chips with dip; it was great I was a little taken back by the price but when I saw the portion it was well worth it. I would recommend to anyone on the strip looking to get there money's worth."}
{"text":"We always get a steak burrito when my husband and I go there. Awesome! Great place, Great service."}
{"text":"The rice was hard (undercooked) and the food was more like tasteless. The quality of the ingredients were fresh. I ate a burrito bowl"}
{"text":"Stopped by for some mango frozen margarita  drinks and there was absolutely no liquor in them  what so ever. We were so disappointed. Never again a complete waste of money!!"}
{"text":"Got the groupon for the two drinks and they are so yummy. The portion size is huge."}
{"text":"The $9 44oz Frozen Margarita is what really drew me to the place. All you have to do to get it is check in at Tacos N' Rita's!!!!! I didn't order any food so i can't comment on that but the Margarita was good and the service was good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had burrito bowl and the steak was good. Similar to a chipotle but higher priced. I also ordered chips and salsa but was very disappointed that the salsa tasted like Pace out of the jar (probably was)."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff if your in the mood for Mexican food and a margarita before a show or fight make sure you stop by"}
{"text":"I ordered the taco salad without the shell and it wasn't good at all. The steak had a weird taste and the salad dressing was watered down and also had an off taste. Waste of money."}
{"text":"So I have to agree with a lot of the reviews on here; this food court establishment attached to a casino floor is putting out sub par, bland, inauthentic Mexican \"fast food\" at best. 

We ordered three enchiladas (extremely overpriced for what it is-but that's Vegas!) and they were \"made to order\" with a small amount of salsa, cheese, and choice of protein. Then they were wrapped up with a dash more salsa and put through an oven salamander (like at Quiznos to warm a sandwich) for a couple minutes and call it enchiladas; they were flavorless, the tortillas were dry and mostly unsauced by the salsa. Nothing resembling true enchilada flavors or actual enchilada sauce. The beans and rice were cooked well, but also very bland. 

The giant overpriced drinks came in three flavors and were an even bigger waste, even with a discount voucher; they were artificial, cloyingly sweet and didn't have even the slightest trace of booze or a balanced margarita. There are sooooo many other options for giant souvenir drinks on the strip- pick one of those over this place at all costs! They will put a quality drink from a better selection in your take home vessel. 

Accompanied by the very inauthentic drinks and food is disinterested and borderline rude service. I was snapped at by more than one employee, during ordering and check out. With the abundance of Mexican options and drinks at every turn anywhere on the strip, let's be real- I would still pick the Taco Bell Cantina down the street over this place as a last resort for half the price, and be much more in the true vibe of the Strip!"}
{"text":"I visited Tacos N' Ritas a few days ago and the service was excellent. The staff was polite and professional. The food was fresh and delicious, and the margaritas' had the perfect amount of alcohol. Everything was reasonably price. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Don't come here!!! So not worth the money.  I bought the Groupon deal thought awesome cups would be given like shown in the pictures but they give you plain cups! Does not have the dead on there and tits basically a over priced slushee. $5 for a extra shot but not worth it either. I do not recommend coming here. Customer service sucked the girl made it obvious she was irritated by the people before me and continued the bad attitude when we ordered. I couldn't event share it with the people in the group because after the first taste it was no thanks."}
{"text":"It is what it is. The food was okay. The service was great. And it was probably the most reasonably priced thing in the food court."}
{"text":"After 3 trips to Vegas my wife seems to like their steak burrito bowl better than ANY of the nicest restaurants we have eaten at."}
{"text":"It was good especially there happy hour  margarita. We had mango and strawberry,they had such a huge glass only 2 or 3 people can finish that drink it can not be finished by one person only. And it's only $9.00 if u sign in by Yelp."}
{"text":"This is a knock off of Chipotle.  The price is reasonable  for the location . The portion is resonably  large and more than enough  food for one person . The steak was not overcooked. The black beans were nice and firm same for the rice. Hot sauce was so bland. The  guacamole  was too sour. Service was ok"}
{"text":"Not as good as the review makes it seems it's okay but this is just oversized and over priced. I grabbed some chicken nachos let's just I can make better ones at home. But it's good if your not looking for authentic mexican food. My girlfriend grabbed chicken enchiladas and again not the best. Paid a total of 36.78 round up to 37, I should have just gone to an actual restaurant and payed more but better food. At the end I didn't even finish the nachos it was too much and not the best same with the enchiladas. Guacamole is not the best and it's 2 dollars extra."}
{"text":"Overall, Tacos N' Ritas was passable.  Here is a list of pros and cons:

Pros:
-Fast meal in a pinch.

-The made the chips for chips and salsa fresh in front of me.

-Relatively cheap meal option in the MGM Grand.

Cons:
-the steak was marinated with a sauce that had a little too much tang.

-Still a bit pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"No. Just no. I guess being from Texas, I am spoiled by truly great taco bars. We walked over thinking we would eat here. After taking a look at the food, we quickly nope'd out of there after getting some garantuan margaritas (bought on groupon 2 for $20). The margaritas were delish but there is seriously no excuse for disgusting produce."}
{"text":"Came in 6/5/17 to Use a Groupon for frozen margaritas. The ladies acted like I was being a bother since I didn't order food. The margaritas were great! You must pay the tax on the deal at the restaurant, but that was about $4. Customer service was lacking so that's why I gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"Note: this was the Tacos N Ritas at the Venetian hotel food court.  The counter worker was nice.  We got an enchilada plate with rice/beans, and a taco plate with rice/beans, an order of chips with guacamole, and two regular-sized margaritas with an extra shot in each.  Total was $62.  OK, Vegas, right.  But the food was a big FAIL. Taco and enchi were average.  Beans (black or pinto, no refrieds) were flavorless.  Rice was just plain white rice (no tomato or onion or any flavoring), with some grains hard/dried.  It bore no resemblance to what the rest of the world knows as Spanish rice or Mexican rice, it was just poorly cooked white rice.  The guac was fine, but came in a tiny cup, approx 1/3 cup.  Basket of chips might have been the worst ever.  Not only flavorless, but the texture -- each chip was partially soft/chewy and partially hard. Maybe they were made/bought a few days ago, then left out to get stale, then nuked or something?  I don't know.  But really, really, DON'T waste your time/money.  If you are at the Venetian, try the Grand Lux Cafe, a few steps away, you'll get delicious food for about the same amount of $$."}
{"text":"Love their margaritas!!!
I got the 44 oz mango margarita for only $9...thanks to Yelp check in. The regular price is $34....what an amazing deal with Yelp check in. 
The drink was really good and I could taste the alcohol more than the mango flavor....which is unbelievable since all the drinks that I got from the strip was lacking alcohol. 
Located inside MGM grand in their food court."}
{"text":"burrito tasty but wet. literally a super wet liquid mess. maybe it was from the pinto beans."}
{"text":"During my week-long stay at MGM, I ate here ... a few more times than I'm proud to admit (out of sheer convenience and deliciousness). Compared to the other offerings at the MGM food court, this place offers the healthiest choices at decent prices and hugeee portions! It's similar to Chipotle (though probably not organic blahblahblah).

Everything is ~$10 regardless of choice of protein (grilled chicken, steak, pulled chicken, etc.) My fave was the burrito salad, which comes with a tortilla base and all the fixings (rice, lettuce, corn, salsa, etc). The tortilla itself is one of the best I've had. It is fluffy and crispy on the edges, without being overly greasy. 

I wouldn't recommend getting the \"burrito bowl\" because it's tiny, even though it's the same price as the burrito salad/burrito! Just get the burrito or even a burrito salad, because you essentially get the same ingredients (rice, lettuce, meat, etc.), just in a different form."}
{"text":"The food is huge. Three people can eat one buritto. The place is super clean & you get fast service. If you want extra sour cream dont be shy ask for what you crave its your money your paying for it. If something is not cheesey enough then I suggest you be outspoken & speak up. This company is more than happy to make your food however your heart desires. I discovered this place days ago. Oh the things you find when your lost inside of a casino. Lol! I will return because its great fast hot food."}
{"text":"I went here on March 2nd and the gals were great and the burrito enchilada was fantastic. There's no way you leave here hungry. It cost me around $15 but I had plenty to eat with leftovers for the next day.  It's less if you don't have guacamole and sour cream but ya gotta have that   highly recommend"}
{"text":"Like if a chipotle burrito was made out of garbage - it's bland and flavorless but at least it's grossly overpriced. Everything costs extra, even SOUR CREAM. Your best bet in this hellish food court is the fast food because you will at least get what you expect (although again, insanely marked up)."}
{"text":"Had the burrito bowl with tofu. The bowl is small looking but actual pretty deep. And the tofu isn't all that special but if you need a quick bite to eat and are a casual vegetarian like me, this place hits the spot before you hit the strip for some fun."}
{"text":"Food is bomb and we got these huge 9dollar margaritas on the app check in.. go here!!

Tommy is da Bommmmmb!"}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon for two margaritas. Due to family emergency, I was unable to use the groupon before it expired. However, the fine print states the face value NEVER expires and can be used toward a purchase from the merchant. Well, I tried to use it and was denied. Showed the merchant the fine print...and was still denied. We even purchased drinks at regular price for the other people in our party..  Attempting to contact the company...no such luck. Reached out to group on for help...their response? ' Sorry you chose not to use the groupon. We can not refund it.But you can use it toward another purchase from the merchant.\" 
This is after three emails with an attached copy of the chat stating all I want is for them to help me get the Tacos N Ritas to honor the fine print."}
{"text":"Great food! Worth the money! We will be back! Love their margaritas!!!
I got the 44 oz mango margarita for only $9...thanks to Yelp check in. The regular price is $34....what an amazing deal with Yelp check in. 
Located inside MGM grand in their food court."}

{"text":"I went to Tacos N' Ritas back in 2014 during a large business convention. I was looking for quick, cheap food to take back to my room and since I was staying in the MGM Grand, I found myself in the foodcourt.

I ordered steak nachos and a frozen strawberry margarita, before eagerly awaiting my food as they made it. These nachos were SO good when I got back to my room, and I fully attribute those tasty chips to the lemon juice they throw on them before sticking them in the fryer. YUM!

To be fair, the food could be considered decently expensive, but it's Vegas and it's convenient. You really can't expect dirt cheap food. They were not shy with the toppings, and I got a healthy heap of both sour cream and guacamole!

I'm heading back to Vegas in February for my friend's 21st birthday, and you can bet we're all heading to Tacos N' Ritas!"}
{"text":"Great groupon deal that attracted us to this place! Huge margaritas with enough tequila to suffice! In my opinion it was a great groupon deal however a little pricey without."}
{"text":"Bland AF. Even with salsa on the tacos it tasted like nothing. The rice has a ton of butter and the beans are half cooked."}
{"text":"This is the worst food I have had in a long time!  the pork is by far horrible, the beef and chicken are dry. Everything had tons of lime in it, my guess is to hide the nasty taste, however, you can still taste the awful flavors. Don't waste your time and money!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day, and I had a chicken quesadilla with a side of sour cream and guacamole. I also got a side of chips and salsa, which was good. It reminds me of chipotle but my quesadilla was tasty."}
{"text":"Want some overpriced taco's?  You've come to the right place!  I was just craving some taco's for some reason and ran into this place.  Meat was decent but nothing to write home about.  If you just happen to pass by and are craving some taco's, this place will do the trick, but if you want some really good taco's in vegas, go to Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a great price! Servings are huge, you'll definitely need a to go bag. Can't wait to have it again today!"}
{"text":"Imagine this: two girls visiting Vegas, low on both money and luck...what could make this trip better? Is it 

A. A smile from Carmen after recommending the mango 'rita and give you extra hot sauce
B. A quickly made quesadilla with amazing pork fillings
C. A compliment on your clearly out of town accent
D. All of the above

If you answered anything but D, you clearly haven't fulfilled your Vegas experience. Be human for a moment in a city full of crazy, and visit Tacos & 'Ritas!"}
{"text":"Located at the Venetian food court, casino level.

This is like Chipotle/Cafe Rio style with the \"fixins' made in front of you.\"
$9-10 for 3 tacos with your choice of meat + lettuce + cheese + salsa.
They charge you extra for almost everything else. ie. sour cream, guac, extra salsa, chips, extra meat.

This is really 2-3 stars but the price does not justify for the food. Def not worth it. But...if you're ever in the mood for something else BESIDES Italian since it seems like that's all they have here at the Venetian/Palazzo...then this is a good alternative. Also less expensive than Taqueria Canonita which is the only casual style Mexican restaurant here on property."}
{"text":"I initially came in for the yelp check in on margarita deal  44.oz $9 +$5 shot. I decided to try this place and it was not good!  

First of all the person taking/preparing orders was annoyed and rushing us as we we're placing our order. Secondly, the cashier was clueless and looked confused when I asked him about the margarita deal. In which isn't much of a deal unless you like sugary slushies! Weak! Even with the shot! Disappointing! Lastly, food was tasteless and mediocre! The steak nachos were just a slab of tasteless ingredients thrown together. The steak burrito and quesadilla was just ok nothing special. Overall,very dissatisfied with service and food."}
{"text":"With my other options in the food court being hotdogs, macdonalds, and pizza, Tacos and Rita's was the obvious choice. 

Carmen was super friendly- a sincere people person. Even asked where I'm from and we discovered a mutual love of an establishment back home- how cool! I'm in hospitality too, and a nice personal interaction makes for a much more memorable experience- fact. 

I ordered the 3 tacos. They were enormous. I'm from LA so I was expecting teeny taco truck size tacos, so I ended up having a snack for later (my suite at The Signature had a kitchen so it worked out). If you don't eat huge portions the 1 taco with beans and rice may be a good option. 

The beef tacos were really tender and tasty. Carnitas were decent too, but I def preferred the beef. 

Overall a great value, messy and tasty."}
{"text":"Drinks were sugary sweet and very limited BUT for the $14 groupon for two drinks we are absolutely not complaining. Got a strawberry mango mix which taste incredible in this Vegas dry heat!"}
{"text":"The taco salad was huge two people can split. Service was quick steak on salad was tasty."}
{"text":"This is basically the Chipotle of Vegas. I was very pleasantly surprised with the tofu which was much tastier than I would have thought. Overall okay flavors and okay priced but not a steal.  I was a little disappointed that adding a little extra sauce was another $1 charge as well but I was certainly full at the end of my burrito bowl."}
{"text":"I wish I would have seen the comments in yelp before ordering- that's the most pathetic Mexican food I had ever! Never ever try it here! They made it horrible with no taste! I ordered enchiladas and they put some weird tasteless sauce! Beans as side were just boiled with no taste!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for the yard long margaritas. We were disappointed because they ran out of the yard long cups. The margaritas tasted good but they literally had no alcohol which was unfortunate considering how expensive the drinks were."}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon for a special to Margaritas in a souvenir cup so when I got there to get the margaritas I was told that they had no more souvenir cups and they wouldn't get any in for a few days considering I was on vacation and will be leaving the next day when to sit down at one of the tables and noticed several of the souvenir cups above on a shelf in their kitchen when I brought it to their attention I was told they were for display only I don't see how something with 12 cups or more can be for a display they did everything to try and convince me to get something more expensive why would I do that when I purchase the Groupon special I'm from California and some of these places in Las Vegas are Crooks I know they wanted me to buy something more expensive but why lie about it so at the end I ended up not purchasing anything why put yourself on Groupon if you're not going to honor anything you put as an advertisement I will pass this along I have friends that live in Las Vegas and I will make sure that they know not to patronize this establishment . Why promote their products on Groupon if they're not going to honor any of there's specials the one girl that was there happened to be a supervisor she was rude and arrogant. Ended up going home not using the Groupon getting my money back and no souvenir cup tacos and Rita is a business you shouldn't patronize!"}
{"text":"Groupon has a great price for 2 32oz drinks and that's what we got. We got the strawberry abc banana and both very good. I only drank a quarter of mine but it was nice( enough for me ). You pay the tax of less than $4."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  They try to nickel and dime you.    Chicken portions are extremely meager.  When I asked for a normal size portion of chicken, they tried to add an additional $2.   The staff is extremely rude.  Don't ever come here."}
{"text":"$30 for a sugar drink with virtually NO ALCOHOL -- STAY AWAY!!!

This review is not for the food--it is only for the \"Margaritas.\"

After I ordered 2 of the 32 ounce Margaritas, the cashier asked, \"Do you want to buy an extra shot of alcohol for the margaritas?\"

What she SHOULD have asked was, \"Would you like to buy a shot of alcohol for your Margaritas,\" because neither of them appear to have had ANY alcohol in them. 

If they did contain alcohol, it had to be a shot or less per 32 ounce margarita, which is a crime when they cost almost $30 a piece.

I'm looking for an official Tacos N' Ritas website where they describe what goes into the Margaritas, but I can't find one, so I guess I can't claim that they're lying...BUT what they ARE doing is taking advantage of all of the Las Vegas visitors who they know probably won't waste what little time they have to come back and try to make any kind of official complaint."}
{"text":"Rude service, overpriced and the servers don't know their own product. Paid over $25 for an ok burrito and plain cheese (no meat) quesadilla. No drinks or sides. Supposedly you can get the quesadilla with vegetables instead of meat. However, the only vegetables turned out to be beans, which come with it anyway. And, they refused to honor their own coupon. Just keep walking past this one."}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe people are giving this place a bad review. My husband and I originally had reservations at pub 1842. We cancelled it and just wanted something fresh and quick. This place hit the spot. I got the 3 tacos and he got a taco salad - all delicious. Yea, you pay extra for things like guac...that also happens at chipotle. The Beers are pricy. Hey guess what?! You're in Vegas!!! This place is fresh and super delicious. I recommend the pulled chicken for extra flavor."}
{"text":"I Used The Yelp Check In To Receive The 44oz Drink For $9...But They Didnt Have The 44oz Cup So I Had To Get 2 Separate Cups.Soooo This Place Isnt A Actual Restaurant It Is In The Downstairs Foodcourt Of The Venetian.The Staff That Night Was A Little Rude.They Didnt Seem To Know What They Were Doing And Everything Was Unorganized.Customers Were Just Jumping In Line,And Breathing On My Food That Was Just Sitting On The Counter.The Frozen Margarita Was Just \"Okay\" And The Food Was...Whatever.I Dont Think I Would Go Back Because Fat Tuesday Was Way Better And Cleaner.If You Do Go Check Groupon For Discounts"}
{"text":"Good drinks plus I bought a groupon 2 32oz drinks for 14$ couldn't beat that deal . Drinks was well worth it . Great fast service as well."}
{"text":"Got the groupon two drinks for I think 14 or 15$ omg couldn't beat that . With or without the groupon I will return very affordable place with good drinks."}
{"text":"Great portions and the supervisor today was incredibly customer service oriented. Really nice lady!"}
{"text":"In Las Vegas for one night. Checked Close Mexican Restaurants and chose Tacos & Ritas based on other reviews. Man did we hit it great. Everything we ordered was great. Food was great and the staff was even better. Our server was a great young man.

If I am back in Las Vegas, this is the place I am going. 
Great place, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love a good Yelp check-in special when I see one! :D 

I literally dragged my wife into a 9 mile roundtrip walk to the MGM from The Mirage this weekend just so i can get their $9 frozen margarita special! And since it was only 106 degrees outside, it was the PERFECT thing to cool me down once we arrived! 

I wish I was actually hungry to want to try their food because it actually looked really good... however, I'll definitely have to save it for the next time we're back."}
{"text":"This place, located inside the Venetian was decent and easy to find in this huge property. I had the beef taco salad, my wife the chicken. The beef was a bit chewy but acceptable. Think Chipotle only costlier. Too many other choices for a repeat visit while here though. Just a convenient bite to eat someplace after checking into our room, and needing to satisfy our nagging hunger pains."}
{"text":"The quesadilla wasn't bad nor was the 44 ounce Margherita (strawberry flavored), I wasn't overwhelmed by anything. The cup the Margherita came in was cute though."}
{"text":"The flavors and textures were all off. The steak was too chewy and the pork was way too sweet. The chips are very thick like pita chips. The guacamole tasted horrible, like a salty and sweet store brand. They should replace this place with a Roberto's which has much better food quality."}
{"text":"We were at the MGM Grand to see KA and wanted a snack before the show. Got an order of chips with salsa and guacamole. Big mistake. The tortilla chips were old, stale, and tasted like they were fried in rancid oil. There were wet spots in the bottom of the foil pan and on the chips, either water or lime juice, but either way they shouldn't have been wet. The cup of salsa seemed like it was from a can or jar of Pace from the grocery store, not fresh. The guacamole did seem like real mashed avocados, but I couldn't taste it due to only tasting rancid tortilla chips. Our barely eaten \"snack\" went right into the trash. Made me glad I hadn't spent more on an actual entree."}
{"text":"Nasty! Worst Mexican food ever!! I rarely give out bad reviews... but this place deserves it!! First off, I know food in Vegas can be a bit overpriced, but this place is the worst ever! First off, the service was terrible! I know it's a fast food type of place but that doesn't mean you need to be so rude when taking orders! Besides, this place is inside a hotel so service should be better anyways! Not all the workers were rude, but the girl taking orders and training the new workers was the worst. She snapped at not only the customers but also the people she was training and talked to people as if they were stupid and didnt understand English. The prices at this place are ridiculous go what you get- the worst tasting Mexican food ever! It was $10 for a burrito and the burrito was so gross. The food here is ridiculously dry! The burrito has rice (no flavor), choice of meat (I got a little bit of each - steak was disgusting dry, bland, and waaaaay overcooked. The other meats tasted sweet like dessert-gross!), beans, and cheese. We also got a taco platter for my friend's daughter. Worst tacos ever! My friend's daughter about choked on it because it was sloppily dry! All they put on it was a few shreds of cheese... and like 3 pieces of carne asana... NO lettuce! We couldn't believe it! I have never seen a taco so dry and stingy. It felt like the stuff was being weighed by the ounce! Look at my pictures if you don't believe how gross they are! There are other foods in the food court here at MGM. Go eat at the others ones! They are so much better. Also, everything here costs extra... and its super expensive too!  Something standard and simple as sour cream costs extra... and it was $1 for a tiny scoop! I will never never ever eat at this place again! Not only was it bad food, but it was terrible service AND expensive! If I could give this place negative stars, I would!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in around 9pm for a \"just got in and we are starving, feed me anything\" meal. Our group ordered the nachos and taco salad. All was good and tasty but HUGE. Really should have ordered 1 meal for 2 people. None of our famished crew finished their meal. Nachos ($11.50) were yummy but took some time as they fried the chips when we ordered, then loaded on the meat and shredded cheese, the put it under a broiler then added the toppings. Oh, you have to order the shredded pork, It's spicy and sweet and rocks on the nachos. Plus get extra salsa. de-lish."}
{"text":"$35 for two food court burritos.  Ordering was having the counter person yell at you.  Like  Chipotle except the food sucks.    The pork was sweet and gross and the steak tasteless.  Plain rice and bland beans,  bland salsa and other toppings. Worst burrito I can remember."}
{"text":"Everything was a lil on the pricy side but hey you're in Vegas I get it. The food wasn't amazing but it was good. Didn't try any of their drinks. Service was awesome, so nice and helpful thank you! I do recommend anyone who wants a fresh yummy tortilla (flour) come here!!!! They are bomb, fresh homemade just like abuelita made. I will be back just for them alone!"}
{"text":"Got up this morning after a long night of food, entertainment, and gambling. I was hungry with a capital H. I decided to give this place a go. I ordered an omlette with tomatoes, green peppers, ham, onions , pepper jack cheese, and mushrooms. White toast and no potatoes. The omlette was very tasty and I enjoyed it very much.

 This is a nice quick option if you dont have time for room service"}
{"text":"Good for quick Mexican-esque food and margaritas, it's not fantastic though. The chicken in our quesadilla was pretty dry and the tortilla wasn't great. It's acceptable for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Place is extremely over priced for what you are getting in terms of quality and quantity of food.

So I got the tortilla soup to stay cheap and it was a shocking $11, for soup .

We all decided to split a fishbowl margarita on the rocks with salt because it was sixty ounces at $35 meanwhile the other margaritas that were twelve ounces were $11 and we figured that we we getting a much better bang for our buck getting the fishbowl.

The margarita was strong, the food okay, and the service relatively poor- we were not given much attention while we ate here."}
{"text":"Tacos N Ritas is located inside the MGM Grand Hotel inside their food court. I went to lunch here with friends because one of my friends comes here often. We each had taco salads each made to our specifications along with non-alcoholic drinks. The food was good, the staff was professional and for the three of us it cost around $40. There are some restaurants in the MGM Grand where dinner for one person can cost over $100. I'm thankful the MGM also has places in their food court where the prices are more reasonable."}
{"text":"If I did not have a groupon for Two Giant 44 o.z. Frozen Margaritas in Souvenir Cups, that got for $20 I would be pissed. The regular price would have been $57. The staff were nice however they are slow, there is a lack of urgency.  The drink is really sweet, we end up drinking it down till where we could split a bottle of Jose Cuervo. Now that made the drink better."}
{"text":"Although better than most fast food options at the MGM food court, Tacos N' Ritas is standard Mexican food.

Given my frequent visits to MGM Wet Republic this past summer, I have been (un)fortunate enough to try all the food options at the MGM food court.  If I could, I would give the Tacos N' Ritas a four star because relative to the other options in the same food court, it is definitely above the pack.  Plus, considering the amount of food you get, I would say that it is also a pretty good deal.  However, is it four star cuisine?  Not really.

After another hot day out at the pool, my friend and I decided to eat here.  Similar to Chipotle, you choose how you want your entree served: burrito, burrito bowl, taco salad, taco, nachos, quesadilla.  From there, you choose your meat to be used.  For example, I chose the taco salad with the chicken meat which was basically an open faced burrito with tons of lettuce.  Again like Chipotle, they asked about different beans, rice, and salsas to add on top. As I mentioned previously, it was solid food with decent flavors.  However, whether this is four star cuisine is highly debatable.

Even with the long line, the service was pretty fast and efficient. 

Overall, Tacos N Rita's is better than most, but still just your average Mexican fast food option at the MGM food court."}
{"text":"The service was very poor, the server yelled at us when we explain what our groupon was ( 2 for 1) and she was saying we all need one and wouldn't even let us explain it. Finally she gave us all of our drinks. The mango wasn't ready yet so some were forced to chose otherwise. The drinks were stronger than I thought after reading other reviews."}
{"text":"Got the steak enchiladas. The corn was meh. For food court food, it was not that great but the check-in offer I gotta say was great. I got the 44 oz. Strawberry Margarita for $9! 105 degrees outside so that huge icee was my best friend."}
{"text":"Foods great for the price. Check into yelp and get a 44oz for 9 bucks instead of 30. Tacos are great and the burrito bowls remind you of chipotle. So a win."}
{"text":"They drinks were nice n big but barely had any liquor in it I enjoy the drink because it taste like a strawberry smoothie but they have to do better"}
{"text":"Got a yelp member deal $9.00 for a 44oz. Mango margarita. The drink was good but a bit to sweet."}
{"text":"Exactly how do you give a restaurant MINUS 5 stars? This has got to be the nastiest wanna be MEXICAN food I've ever had. Not to mention overpriced. Mexicans don't let Mexicans eat nasty and overpriced food."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for the drinks.  They were tasty but i can't imagine paying the regular price of $45 for 2 slushies with alcohol.  Get the Groupon and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"3 types of margaritas, original, mango and strawberry. Mango and strawberry were unavailable when we visited. Drinks are weak and made with Jose Cuervo. Below average normal food court quality."}
{"text":"Decided to try this Mexican place it has such a great name and the staff was really friendly. The menu is self explaining and allows one to select their main dish and then the protein finally the toppings. I ended up having a margarita, even though it was blended it tasted really good and not cheap at all. It's not top shelf liquor but it's not cheap either. 

I ended up ordering a burrito bowl and taco salad. I opted with carna asada for proteins for both entrees. There pinto beans are awesome too. They do not skimp on the cheese or sour cream. The salad and the bowl were both huge and can be shared with twins or between a family. I am very happy with the taste of their meat too was very juicy and beefy."}
{"text":"Great food when you need something quick. Food is pricey for what it is but I was happy with the steak quesadillas. The chips & salsa are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"NO flavor. Had the $11 chicken bowl - gross. Pico de gallo was terrible, cheddar cheese was a poor add - ingredients just lack quality and flavor..."}
{"text":"I can only review the one item I ordered, which was the chicken nachos- which was nothing less than amazing!!!!! 
How can nachos be amazing you ask? Let me tell you....

We watched as the tortilla chips were fried on the spot into thick and perfectly salted triangles of goodness. The chicken breast slices were perfectly seasoned and abundant.  The guac, cheese and salsa were perfect and fresh. 

For $11, this was I believe the best deal in Vegas- and it's at a good court- who would've thought? 

For a reasonable and very tasty quick lunch while you are out shopping or sightseeing or coming back from a conference- go here and get these nachos! 

And... if you are out late at night or looking to get really messed up, I saw that they sold giant fishnet clad plastic legs of margarita- fun fun, lol."}
{"text":"Decided on buying yet another groupon coupon  from Tacos  and Rita's. You get 2 44 ounce frozen margaritas for 19 dollars with a souvenir cup. The margaritas were delicious. We added a shot to each margarita because I read that the alcohol content in the premade drinks aren't very high so we decided to add a shot. This is located in the MGM grand food court. 
     We didn't eat here so I can't tell you about the food. I do know that they had a line of people eating there so it must not be that bad. This place reminded me of eating at a chipotle where you pick your toppings and food. 
      If your looking for a tasty margarita give this place a try but be sure to buy a groupon and get a good deal.   The groupon is a $56 dollar value for 19 dollars."}
{"text":"The drinks were ok. I felt the liquor used was a little cheap. The food was also okay. Nice place to eat and drink on the go or if u have time to sit a while. It's like a chipotle that serves alcohol."}
{"text":"The best margarita!!! 
if you tell them if you are sing in the margaritas cost 9.00 + tax"}
{"text":"F' yeh!!!! These people are serious about their tacos. It's assembly line construction with street food flavor! 

Quick service. Friendly staff. Large cleaning dining space. I hope I remember to hit them up on a return trip. I ended ordering cabeza, carnitas and lengue. And my favorites were in the same order."}
{"text":"OK, if you're looking to go healthy, then, by all means, get the bowl and cut out rice and beans (or pick one). If you're looking for any semblance of quality or something around as satisfying as chipotle, you'll be very disappointed. Tried the steak and chicken during my stay at the Venetian and the meats were very overcooked/rubbery and flavorless. It was like eating rubber. Their green salsa is OK. They have very limited options to choose from."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a Groupon for margaritas here but by the time we made it over, neither of us wanted to drink. We attempted to give the Groupon away, but nobody wanted free booze so we decided to ask if we could just get the cups filled with something else. They were happy to oblige the request - though they didn't have any drinks I was interested in so I ended up ordered a regular margarita anyway. The upside was that it wasn't too sweet - the downside was I didn't really want to drink. Not their fault and I'm sure under different circumstances I would have  been more into what they were offering."}
{"text":"The two ladies working there this morning were incredibly sweet and helpful in regards of being suggestive, offering samples I never even asked for, it was awesome treatment. Much more than you'd expect in a food court.

I had a burrito with the sweet pork AND steak because I asked for half and half and it was soooo good. I've never had barbacoa that good. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"food isn't fantastic. can't beat that
margarita groupon though! a little boozy but nice icy sugary slush when it's hot outside!"}
{"text":"After a debacle at the Venetian we headed to the MGM location to redeem my bfs groupon he was beyond annoyed that we had to go travel from the Venetian to the MGM for his margarita. The ladies at this location were extra nice when we explained what happened at the Venetian. In the end the margarita had no alcohol so the bf was disappointed. Not worth the headache just skip the groupon. But the service was great."}
{"text":"No stars. This place is wack not even listed on the map of the Venetian. We had a groupon for a huge margarita but they were out of the glass. They said they would have them by 6. Bf was highly upset to find out we had to either wait which we couldn't due to going to a show or go to the MGM location and redeem there. Crappy story is we went to the MGM location where they said \"why didn't they just give you another cup?\" Also bought a side of guac and chips due to needing a snack. Average. Chips have pepper on them which was what caused an average score."}
{"text":"Meh....food was maybe better than Taco Bell (which I love) but the price was double that of chipotle. $14 for forgettable nachos isn't going to do it. Won't ever return."}
{"text":"my husband got food poisoning from the chicken here on Friday Night. This ruined the remainder of his trip which he was SO excited about. I am writing this to see if anyone else was sick between 5/11-5/12/18."}
{"text":"They margaritas were amazing and huge! The workers were very nice and fast! We will be going back"}
{"text":"Came by to eat here today there was a long line but it moved pretty quickly they had good customer service friendly had a taco salad with the works guac pico corn and sour cream it was rreeaaallllyyyy ggoooooddddd would definitely  come back also had a mango magarita it was decent a little on the weak side should of tooking up on the cashiers offer for an extra shot but hey well leave it for next time check this place out if your ever in the mgm"}
{"text":"Came here on our first night in Vegas, definitely not worth what we paid... no taste at all! Meat was extremely dry, don't think we will be back"}
{"text":"so i stood behind in line watching everyone in groups order their food . i approach the cashier as i noticed that the group was still ordering their food and no one was utilizing the cashier. i was told everone else has a groupon... ridiculous why would you want your line to continue to grow when u can take care of the breveges. now the guy behind me has 2 wait for 4 other people to pay and for me to get my drinks..."}
{"text":"These are probably the most bland tacos I've ever had in my life. Cold, and mostly resembles chewing cardboard. Absolutely no taste at all. Hardly any salsa so very dry also."}
{"text":"Not too bad, over priced of course but hey, late night craving for burrito, why not:)"}
{"text":"Decided to get some steak nachos to go. Got back to the room and the cheese was all congealed. Steak didn't have much flavor. Eh....

Saw a bunch of people getting the margaritas though. Guess they had a Groupon on deal. Looked good!"}
{"text":"They have poor customer service and wait times. The employees will chat with their friends before they help a customer."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to take a break from expensive Vegas dinners and stick to a low-key, food court meal. The choices were not exactly... good, but there was a sizeable line in front of Tacos N 'Ritas so I gave it a go. 

While waiting, I saw some steak quesadillas being made and went for that, because it actually looked freshly-made/made to order. The other bowls seemed kind of sad in comparison to other fast food chains (I.e. Chipotle) especially the side of corn, which looked canned?? The quesadillas come with a side of sour cream and guacamole- guac tasted slightly odd but still tasted ok. 

I asked for a side of the hot sauce, which I think is the sauce they use for the enchiladas. It was hot and green- and actually a really nice dipping sauce for the quesadillas. It was worth $1 more, but was totally worth it. 

Service was terrible- the cashier spoke in a very brusque manner and haphazardly throwing plastic utensils and napkins into trays. 

Definitely 2/5."}
{"text":"This place is in a 'food court' style area and the food quality exceeded my expectations for the restaurant style. I got a vegetarian burrito bowl with the signature spicy salsa. The food was 4 stars, but overall experience was 3 stars (due to the aftermath of you catch my drift)."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. I took one bite of my taco and threw the plate away. Food was cold and old. Complete waste of money."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the margaritas. I got the Groupon, 2 for $14. Worth the money any day, but especially on a 110 degree day. It doesn't taste like it has alcohol but it does...enough to give a little buzz. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"I only went because I had a groupon for two really large drinks for only $19.95... The margarita was so basic OMG. Even with the deal it was still a waste of money. We ended up trying to improve the taste by adding more liquor but that didn't even help. So we just poured them down the sink. But if you are in the market for a nice large souvenir cup then this is your place. But if you're looking for a great margarita you should possible look else where. Also even with the groupon they steal charge us an extra $8 that was never mentioned anywhere online. Just an FYI..."}
{"text":"I have had over a dozen frozen marsgritas and this has to be the Best frozennn drinksss in the MGM better than the rest and the refills are way cheap make sure you stop by and try it out you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My friend and I only went to redeem the yard margarita Groupon. You get 2 yard drinks for $14 on Groupon, but you have the pay the tax at the register which is about $4. Overall it was a great deal, and the margaritas were tasty and you could taste the alcohol! :)"}
{"text":"I only went for the margaritas (no food ordered). The margaritas are great, especially with a couple of extra shots. I did use Groupon and purchased a bottle of tequila at a liqour store near Bally's to add more alcohol."}
{"text":"I think ive might of missed the part on where their margaritas do not contain any alcohol... and if it did, it would of only been MAYBE just one shot in that 44oz drink. not worth it."}
{"text":"Incredible tofu tacos, Tommy makes everything with love and you can really taste it. Guac is sooo good"}
{"text":"Walked a mile into the casino to get my drink with my Groupon and the workers closed shop an hour early!  The three unprofessional workers told me their website isn't updated with their new earlier closing time amd they refused to honor my voucher. My vacation was carefully planned out so I dont have the time avaiable to go back to use the voucher so I'm out  $20!"}
{"text":"Decent Taco Shell, middle of the road, food court Mexican food.  Had to grab a quick bite when at a conference.  I thought this was one of the better places in the MGM food court.  If you ordered the bowl/Salad in instead of the Fried Tortilla Bowl, you get more food.  I upped the meal with Avocado (worth it) and the Chicken looked like it was better prepared than the other options."}
{"text":"The only thing that brought us to Tacos N'Ritas was the Groupon deal for the yard sized frozen margarita. I bought it while I was waiting for my luggage at the airport and it was good to use by the time I got to the MGM. The margaritas are okay, much sweeter than Fat Tuesdays version. Can't taste much alcohol nor did it get you that intoxicated. 

Staff is efficient. Food is decent/okayish."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my Burrito Bowl, and used my Groupon to purchase a Mango/Strawberry margarita. I was very pleased with the portion of food I received. I'll definitely revisit.."}
{"text":"I'm going to give an extra star for four stars because of the great deals and friendly staff.  I bought the 2-32 oz for $14 on Groupon, which is a pretty good deal.  They only had three flavors to choose from:  strawberry, mango, and margarita.  My friends, who don't drink much and don't like to taste alcohol enjoyed them because they tasted like slushies.  I, on the other hand would rather have it stronger, so I added an extra shot for $5.  But don't expect to feel anything from these drinks but being bloated; I don't think these are ever meant to be strong.  We came for more the next day because if you check in on Yelp, you get the 44 oz for $9."}
{"text":"Fast service and really good margaritas. Maybe the best I have had so far. I used a groupon and finding the place was definitely worth it. The cups are perfect for carrying around. And it is thick so it doesn't melt really fast."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best Mexican food I've had and this is from someone that lives in L.A. The service was beyond amazing!! Along with the amazing nachos and burrito!!! Whatever you want on it they will put in it. Luis , Jessica and Joanna really were great!! They provided great service and great at helping us pick out what we wanted. I think this is a MUST GO TO spot when at the MGM ! I can twice in one day that's how good this place was! Portions are BIG!! And they aren't shy when adding Things to your plate! NACHOS ARE A MUST!! And yes they do serve alcohol"}
{"text":"This place is located inside of the MGM Food Court. The people who rated this place more than two stars must not know good mexican food. First of all they were very slow workers didnt seem to have a sense of urgency. The burritos are overpriced for a tiny scoop of meat and every topping besides cheese and lettuce cost extra. For one carne asada (steak) burrito it cost me $13.75 and thats with no drink oh and they dont have cups of water only bottled water for $3.75! sorry but I am not paying that much for water when i had a bunch in my hotel room. So then i sit down and try to enjoy my expensive burrito and it was the most BLAH tasting burrito i have ever had. I woulnt recommend this place to anyone if you want good flavorful and fair priced mexican food i would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Definitely take advantage of the Yelp special! We split the 'rita 3 ways. The tacos are good with corn tortillas. The beef was flavorful & real tender! Yummy cilantro lime rice & black beans too!! It's pricey but you will save a few bucks hitting up the food court vs. some expensive restaurant at MGM."}
{"text":"Came here because of Groupon for two yard drinks for $14. Staff was super friendly and nice. Was disappointed that I didn't get the souvenir cups just plain yard drink cups. Also, I don't think these had any alcohol because me and my boyfriend finished these and felt absolutely nothing which was disappointing. The drink was really sweet and good (strawberry margarita mix) but it pretty much was a slushy. They didn't card me as well which also leads me to believe that these might be non-alcoholic."}
{"text":"This place is sort of a more bland, slightly overpriced version of Chipotle. The food is okay but nothing special and didn't seem especially fresh. It's not terrible and it's a viable option if you want Chipotle style food and don't want to trek to the other end of the strip for the real thing. On the plus side, portion are large so you'll be full."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas for my 21st so I planned on drinking everything in sight. My mother purchased a Groupon with Tacos n Rita's for two 32oz frozen drinks and it was just flavored slushee, nothing boozey about it we had to add our own liquor to it because it was nothing but juice, won't be going back there on the 2nd trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely ridiculous. walked around the hotel for a half hour looking for it and when I finally found it they had no margaritas. How the hell do you call yourself Tacos and ritas if you don't have margaritas? Plus the staff was rude."}
{"text":"Food is very good, the burritos are huge! Its worth the price, especially being in a hotel. I got the chicken taco and it tasted fresh. The employees worked quick and provided good service. It satisfies my itch for Mexican food when I'm in the food court. Worth checking out. They have a good drink selection as well and huge margaritas."}
{"text":"First of all, I don't know why Tacos N' Ritas is rated lowly. They're a quick meal with good food and excellent service. We bought the groupon deal for two yard sticks for $14. You can't beat that! It was delicious and ridiculously cheap, we were so shocked!"}
{"text":"kind of chipotle-esque. Food was OK for the options in this area. You can order a margarita and bring it with you to the pool, which is nice. If you are starving and there are no other options this place will hit the spot."}
{"text":"These have to be the nicest people ever. My daughter wanted a breakfast burrito but they don't offer it so I went to johnny rockets and got eggs and hash browns and brought it to them and they made my daughter her burrito at no cost. That's amazing customer service"}
{"text":"I was at the MGM Grand for a conference and had lunch in the food court several times.  The first time I choose Tacos N' Ritas.  I will say it was pretty good for a food court Mexican joint.  I had a taco salad without the shell.  I had my choice of meat, toppings and salsa.  I got chicken with beans, no rice, lettuce, salsa and sour cream.  Guacamole was extra so I did not get it.  I did take my food to go and the cashier was a bit confused on where to find a lid for my salad and the plastic bag to put it in.  But the lady making the food was very nice and fast and was taking care of multiple people's orders."}
{"text":"Gustavo was amazing!!! Not only was he so sweet but he was so helpful! I'll be back just for him!"}
{"text":"if you're in the mgm, need something quick and cheap, this is a totally solid stop.
i liked the chili beef and pulled chicken tacos and thought the breakfast taco was a great deal.  For $6 i had 1 sausage-egg-cheese taco and it was a great base to get my day drinking on! and it was tasty, most importantly.
for what it is (fast food in a food court) - it ain't bad!"}
{"text":"Wow I get excited when I go to tacos and Rita's at the MGM Grand. Hugo served me and he is so wonderful!! And this location standards of operations is so organized  The quality of the food is definitely  the plus."}
{"text":"Service is great. The associates are pleasurable. I really enjoy watching them interact with the customers and one another. They are  Clean , fast ,and friendly.  The food is always A1. I eat here at least 3 times a week and it always taste fresh. The various meal combinations are awesome. I really love the taco plate. But I still get there and find it hard to choose what to get. Tacos and Rita's is the best restaurant in the Venetian by far. I would recommend that everyone that lives in Vegas or just visiting to go eat there. If you are looking for a great meal I challenge you to go to Taco's and Rita's in the Venetian Hotel and Casino. It's healthy and taste great"}
{"text":"Decent food, big prices. Ran out of coffee at breakfast just as I arrived at the register, which was the only reason I stood in line for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"2 32 0Z Frozen Marg's on Groupon for $14! DELICIOUS + strong = steal! 

Don't forget to grab one on your way in or out of the Venetian."}
{"text":"Great margaritas! We used the yelp deal to get massive 44 oz frozen margaritas for only $9!"}
{"text":"This place is located inside the Venetian Hotel in Vegas. You would think it's a perfect fix for a late night snack. The set up is nice, all the sides are clearly visible. The meat, however is rather questionable. For some reason, they put their steak under some sort of liquid broth. I mean, I know steak is the more expensive protein and you don't want it to dry out, but to take strips of meat out of a liquid and plop it atop a mountain of nachos, dripping with liquid, is plain gross. 

Side note to manager-hire people who smile."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Drinks don't have alcohol even though you pay for it.  And Groupon purchase for here is a scam with additional fees"}
{"text":"Rude service, bad food. We were starving when we stopped here to grab a quick bite. We were told our food costed one price, but the employee rang up a different price. Go somewhere else where the employees actually want to serve you."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, tasty and the burrito enchilada style is just delicious!!
Very friendly staff too! 
Coming back here for sure"}
{"text":"This place was just alright, but I've definitely experienced better. It's great for a quick pick up if you're hungry but don't want to shell out café or buffet prices on the strip. My bf and I were starrrving after watching a show so we walked the strip but somehow ended up here. The line was long so we thought that the food was the bomb which is why people were lined up for it. We waited at least 30 mins till we were able to order. It was a little pricey. They didn't have hot hot sauce, but portions were just okay. The food wasn't the best, its a little bit like chipotle but a little less options and maybe less healthy. Their chips and salsa were pretty good, but I felt a little disappointed. It would've been fine had we gotten the food super fast, but that wasn't the case. They also should wrap their burritos in foil because my boyfriends burrito was messy to eat. Not really recommended but I could see why some folks love this place."}
{"text":"Best possible customer service I've ever received! So friendly!!!!

Joana and Carmen, jessica have amazing personalities!!"}
{"text":"This place is worse than Taco Bell. Located in the food court of MGM, this wannabe Chipotle had the worst possible food and service. I unfortunately got the carne asada quesedilla which tasted like rubber. The food was beyond bland and had a weird texture to it that I barely even finished my first bite. As for the service, I was dumb enough to stand around at the register while the employees looked like they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Even if you were blacked-out drunk looking for something to eat, you would have better luck going to the McDonald's in the food court."}
{"text":"Nastiest tacos I've ever had. The grease was unbelievable. When I went to go ask for new ones they said it was just juice. NO! ITS GREASE! Then when they finally replace the tacos they asked for my whole plate with the rice and beans on it, they threw away the rice and beans and then gave me back a plate with only tacos. Really? Don't waste your time going here. It's a rip off and the food is disgusting. Service of course was just as bad."}
{"text":"I didn't get to try the food or the margaritas since the location was closed before midnight (around 11pm). I was really looking forward to trying a margarita. Oh well. Maybe I'll try the one at the Venetian."}
{"text":"Literally discussing, coming from California I know good Mexican food and this was anything but authentic. Their barbacoa is way too sweet with a teriyaki taste and their hot sauce literally tastes like tostitos brand chip salsa. Don't order the guacamole it taste like powder mix guac. Honestly run for the hills I rather eat tacobell."}
{"text":"Doesn't taste good.  Had burrito with sour cream and gauc with a soda.  Cost $17.  Spend the extra money and go to a better spot."}
{"text":"I LOVED TACOS & RITAS IN THE MGM.... & yes although we bought the Groupon 2-32OZ they didn't have the souvenir cups the ones you see  on the selves are for display & glued. So don't believe the bad review below. They were still great & the best tasting to me. & yes we tried other spots like the margarita bar is the name I believe on the strip that place is a total waste of money & hard rocks wasn't too bad. But for me hands down TACOS N RITAS was THE BEST! Drinks & food. The only bad thing was they were out of the souvenir cups, but they're still the best. I went everyday on my b-day trip & was worth the 14 plus tax you pay for 2."}
{"text":"I found this place as a deal on groupon. The groupon contained two 32oz margaritas for $14.00. which is a great deal because they want about $22.00 otherwise for each. I decided to give their food a try. I had the burrito bowl it was mediocre. I definitely had better but it was a quick bite."}
{"text":"They were super nice and I got a fabulous margarita.  The bowls were delicious!  Will return."}
{"text":"What a bummer!!!! 
Saw on Yelp and online that they closed at 12:00 when they actually close at 11:00 during the week, I got there at 11:02 and the manager wouldn't let me purchase my margarita voucher I believe his name was Armando or Eduardo."}
{"text":"Very excited to find this fast, affordable, well-portioned vegan option. Ordered chips and guac and a tofu burrito (hold the cheese. Loved it! Plan on eating here again during my stay at MGM Grand."}
{"text":"[i priced food, 1 soft taco $10.98, GTFOH!!.I am from CA, tacos on every corner priced anywhere from $1 - $4."}
{"text":"Why, oh why does this awful food court even exist. 

In a resort with some of the finest dining in the city, this food court is an insult to any human with taste buds. 

We were on property for a show and we decided to grab a quick bite in the food court beforehand since we didn't have time for a sit down meal.

My mom and I decided to share some nachos and a drink since we weren't super hungry. I stood in line next to some extremely obnoxious spring breakers and ordered my meal. When I first asked for nachos, I watched the guy in back making chips from scratch, so I started to feel a little more optimistic about our food court decision, but feeling soon faded. The girl at the counter topped the freshly made chips with a sad amount of shredded cheese, ran it through the warmer and then asked if I wanted any salsas to go with that. Um, even for strip pricing I would expect a little more for my $10 than a sprinkling of cheese atop 20-30 chips... 

I asked her to add chicken and then proceeded to add every possible other topping I could think of to salvage this travesty of a meal. By the end, it looked decent enough. I paid and was on my way to the table my mom had secured.

One bite in and I was done. He chips tasted stale, despite watching the guy make them fresh and were so salty. The chicken was beyond dry and none of the salsas tasted like anything close to food. 

I cannot stress this enough, there are so many wonderful places to eat inside Venetian and Palazzo at the same price point or slightly more, that there is absolutely no reason anyone should need to eat at this pathetic little food court."}
{"text":"Over priced and tasteless.  No flavor, undercooked and dark old guacamole. 11$ for burrito, side of beans and tube $2 guacamole $2 bottle water $4"}
