{"text":"This was our second visit to this family run Chinese restaurant.   I had the garlic shrimp combo dinner. So much food with the entree which was spicy with lots of large prawns and vegetables.  Served with lo mein noodle, cream cheese filled wontons, eggrole, and eggdrop soup all made fresh. My wife had the garlic chicken dinner which was also a wonderful dish.  Suggest you try the entree by itself at least once and then as a combo dinner. If sharing more than one dish go for the entrees.  Very good service and comfortable surroundings to enjoy your dinner.  I highly recommend this restaurant which serves authentic Chinese cuisines."}
{"text":"The food was awesome,  the service was quick, and this place is a hidden gem.  I had the jalapeño chicken it is really spicy but it's a good spice.  I can't wait to get back and try something else."}
{"text":"Best Asian food in Goodyear that we have had. Been searching for somewhere to eat besides Panda Express and this is the place! Very good food at a really good price. Everything we tried was good and if we have a craving for Chinese food, this is where we go. The orange chicken is different than your typical orange chicken but in a good, less breaded, way. I highly recommend i"}
{"text":"We put up with the unfriendly waitstaff because the food was good. However tonight we endured unfriendly waitstaff plus hair in our food. When we showed the staff the hair they took it back in the kitchen and all laughed and never came back to talk to us. When I asked for a manager she said \"it's OK you don't have to pay\" she couldn't talk to me because she was on the phone with DirecTV. It was more important to talk to DirecTV instead of dealing with a customer with a valid issue. We will never go back again. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I ordered the sesame chicken combo which was a huge meal! It came with the chicken, lo mien, fried rice,  2 cheese puffs (wontons), and an eggroll. The eggroll was truly the highlight,  and this is coming from a girl who NEVER eats eggrolls because they get soggy & the cabbage has a gross texture & flavor... but, that was not the case with these.  They were big, crunchy on the outside, and perfectly cooked on the inside with like this chicken sausage...MMM! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! They didn't even come and check up on me and my guest! I had to ask my friend for some of their drink because i didn't have anymore! It was all about the money their! Smh ! They need to be closed down!"}
{"text":"Great food and nice staff.. Very fast service, I have been there many times..highly recommended."}
{"text":"All I can say is...WOW! My husband and myself really truly enjoyed our meals. He ordered the General Tso chicken and I ordered the Jalapeño chicken. Both were delicious! 
The portions are huge and well worth the cost, which was very reasonable. 
The restaurant was clean and comfortable and the staff was very friendly. My order was prepared quickly. 
I will definitely be back! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"I love wok wei! The noodles are delish!! The portions are also huge and great for the price! (Dinner combo is $9 I believe)"}
{"text":"Best Asian food in the area.  Huge portions, cooked excellent and was a very clean place. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing food, large portions, clean kitchen, nice staff! Finally a good Chinese restaurant in this area"}
{"text":"Tried this place because it was recommended on Nextdoor.  Wow - for the first time since we've moved to Goodyear, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this place was.  The inside was neat and clean and we had great service.  And most importantly the food was delicious.  I had the Orange Beef extra spicy and loved it. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Good Americanized Chinese food. Huge portions for the combo. Flavorful with large shrimp, good quality chicken, fresh veggies. Quick service. Friendly."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food. The more authentic the better. I have eaten here many times and have been happy every time. The employees and owners are all very nice to chat with. I will continue to eat there."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time since moving back to Arizona. The orange chicken is sliced thin making it not very \"meaty\", but the sauce was very good. The fried rice in the combo does not include veggies and didn't taste very good to me. The portion sizes are generious. We did take out- and it was quite the process for picking it up on a busy Friday night. It seems like this is a family run place that may need a little more staff then they have to keep up. The person who finally helped me was friendly."}
{"text":"Food is decent but waiting time, not so much. Just a friendly suggestion, if you make the customers wait for more than 30 minutes on a Friday night, they will not come back. 
Lunch time wasn't that bad."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat for lunch when we do go out. The lunch specials are amazing, and they give you so much food for only $6. I hate seeing comments that try to compare this place with Panda. It's so much better. The best part is that we get to support a locally owned business."}
{"text":"Always fresh and delicious and quick service!  They make Kung pao the way I like it spicy with with lots of veggies. 
Combo meal at dinner time or lunch is a great value!"}
{"text":"Fantastic chinese for the west valley where we so not have anything other than panda express, have been back a couple of times."}
{"text":"Great food great prices it's nice and clean we love the lunch specials service it's great. My kids loved this place they eat anything from here even the soup. 
Truly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Most delicious Chinese food I've ever had. Everything was fresh and seasoned to perfection. I had the dinner combo of sesame chicken. It came with an egg roll, two cheese puffs (which were amazing), lo mein, and fried rice. I would suggest this place to anyone who supports local businesses and fresh tasty food."}
{"text":"Wok Wei should be called Walk Away. It's not good. When I first walked in, I thought it looked a lot like a gymnasium with a tables and chairs. Not an appealing atmosphere. The waiter eventually took my order. The tea was very cloudy and tasted bad, so I didn't have much more than a sip. The waiter brought me Egg Drop soup when I very clearly said Hot and Sour  - he even repeated the order back. Not what I like, so I pushed it aside. My attempts to flag him down were ignored. Someone else brought my entree. I pointed out to him that I was given the wrong soup. He mumbled something and took the soup away, but never brought back a replacement. The Kung Pao Chicken was not good at all. The vegetables were pretty much raw and all I could really taste was celery. The eggroll had a terrible, sour flavor. Their cabbage must have been sitting out too long since that's the only thing I could find in the entire egg roll. Nothing good to say about this place. Walk Away! Anything else is better."}
{"text":"freakin delish , hands down \"thee\" best chinese spot i've found in az... been there twice in the last week! we're going down the menu, so far we devoured: 
 jalapeño chicken, kung-pao chicken, mooshu pork, shrimp & veggies, war wonton soup, cantonese noodles, mongolia beef, beef lo-mein, spring rolls & egg drop soup  every single item has been a 10 in saying that it's pure extasy** ooh yea & orange chicken..
if you haven't been!? go i'm speaking as a fellow food lover 
enjoy good eats!"}
{"text":"Nice little place with good portions. Usually go for lunch and the portions definately fill you up. Meal comes with rice, spring roll, soup, cream puff and whatever you order. Lunch runs about $5-8/person. Good customer service."}
{"text":"Came in here hungry and left very satisfied. My first time. Great service, very friendly.
We tried the orange chicken (a must have) and the beef and broccoli. Both really good. Also we had the appetizer sampler. Delicious :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, I have been looking for a good Asian place. This place was the best I had in a long time. The portion were great for the price. I was more than full.
Service was great and quick. The soup could have been a little hotter. I will be definitely going back."}
{"text":"Prices are very cheap for the amount of food you get.  Not spicy, a lot of veggies and the chicken spring rolls are big and AWSOME."}
{"text":"I really like the food here and the restaurant itself is very nice and extremely clean. Although I haven't eaten inside I've picked up two different combos. 

 I'm not a coniseur of Chinese food but I know enough to when something is good. The first time I had the kung pao chicken combo which comes with fried rice(which isn't your typical fried rice but still really good) chow mein, egg roll, two cream cheese puffs, + your choice of soup. I didn't have the soup because they will only give to you if you eat in. So I can't judge the soup. 
The second time I had the general tsos chicken. Same sides included. 
I enjoyed both combos but preferred the kung pao because of the spice and vegetables. 
My one and only complaint-The Price. $9.55 for each one of these combos. But the price is justified because you get a lot of food, a lot. It's enough for two women to share. I'm a man and can finish it, gorging of course. But I'd prefer not to. 
And that's my tip to the owners-you need to offer a little less food on the dinner combo for $2 less. I'm retisent to order the combos anymore because of the amount of food. I'm a fan of combos so I'm at a loss. Maybe the lunch special is less food because the combos are much cheaper for those lunch specials??? But I'm not in the area around lunch time so I can't order that lunch. 
Other than that you won't be sorry if you can eat a lot of food."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight with my husband and daughter.  This place is great!  Everything that they brought to the table tested great and was freshly prepared.  We had the Wok Wei dinner which comes with soup, appetizer, fried or steamed rice and one entrée for each person ordering.  Wow! the other reviews were not kidding the portion size was crazy big.  On the appetizer they give you egg roll, cheese puff, spare rib and fried shrimp, one each for each person, so we got two of each.  When she brought out the fried rice it was a huge plate, the entree sizes were nice too.  The service was fast and the food was great.  I agree with an earlier reviewer about the egg rolls, these were some of the best I have had.  The price for what you got was very reasonable.  This is our new go to place for Chinese food!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This little gem is awesome.  Clean, nice staff and good Chinese food. I had the chicken lo mein, hubby had the orange chicken.  Both lunch specials came with a cup of delicious egg drop soup, egg roll, cream cheese wonton and fried rice.  $5.95 each!

Food is cooked to order with good american Chinese flavors.  Quicker and much tastier than the close by Chinese drive thru chain:)

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I never heard any body mention this place around town, so I decided to check.it out on my own terms.place is spotless.clean.staff was really friendly and patient with my company.a few loud kids and my sister.lol.anyways food was good!freshly cooked.not a long wait.egg drop.soup was good too.i had a dinner combo.and it was.filling.no complaints from me :-)"}
{"text":"This was the best Chinese food I have ever eaten.  We went in for the lunch special, which is a great value! $6 for a ton of food (soup, meat, rice, spring roll, cheese crisp). 

The restaurant was very clean and the service was great. We got our food quickly and it was fresh and delicious. I'm very impressed."}
{"text":"The service is very quick and nice and the portions are a good size. 

Definitely go during lunch time for the great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Visiting here for the second time, once again we weren't disappointed, lots of good food and very tasty."}
{"text":"This is the best Asian cuisine we've had! It has become a monthly take-out treat for us. The spring rolls are light and crispy and my boyfriend loves the orange chicken. I ordered the vegetable egg fu young tonight and it was amazing! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to report that my last review was WRONG:  this restaurant has not closed down; apparently, they only took a few days off around Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service and fast. Have never had A bad trip there"}
{"text":"First time coming here for takeout and I will definitely be back. My daughter and I shared the bbq pork fried rice and chicken lo mein entrée. We also go the egg rolls and cheese puffs both amazing! Decent prices but it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today great prices great service and the food was really good  had sweet and sour chicken. Soup and roll plus tea all for under 10. And it was good. Give it a try place was not that busy for being so good"}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here and I had the Moo Goo Gaipan and she had the Cashew Chicken.  The chicken in both dishes was cooked to perfection and so were the vegetables.  The vegetable spring roll was very good and so was the hot and sour soup.  The prices were $5.95 for each dish and based upon the quality of the food and the price that is why I gave it 5 stars.  We will definitely come back.  I have tried another Chinese restaurant near here and the food and service here were much better than their competition.  The waitress was very friendly and made sure we always had enough water or anything else we might want."}
{"text":"Not bad - good size portions, average pricing, but nothing ooo and ahhh. Egg drop soup was good- sesame chicken, orange chicken, sweet and sour pork all average. Didn't care for egg rolls, cheese puffs ok but again nothing special."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 1 star because there is no option for zero stars!!! I ordered the orange chicken and yuck!!! I have never seen chicken look like this it taste like this before. Absolutely disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Been here several times, can't beat lunch combos... Try them all.  Yet the service is something to be desired, its not awful, but could be better. Placed order to takeout, should be ready in 15 min, when I get there I wait at least another 15-20 mins. When dining in service is okay but you have to get waiters attention, they don't come around consistently... Again food is great, but I don't care how great food is, service takes priority over everything."}
{"text":"I come here at least twice a week, if not more! Food is Always fresh and service is great! The absolute best Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian beef/chicken around, NOBODY compares! The Cantonese pan fried noodles and Singapore noodles are top notch too! This place is 5 stars, no question about it!"}
{"text":"I had read previews reviews about this place and everyone seemed to say how good the food was- so we decided to give it a try last night. When I walked it it seemed pretty busy (6:20pm) so that was a good sign. I ordered take out and yes the lady behind the register is a little \"unfriendly\". I ordered the Cashew Chicken and Kung Pao chicken combos for my husband and myself. While I waited another lady was waiting as well and I told her it was my first time and how skeptical I was about it. She couldn't say enough positive things about this place! She said they've had several items on the menu and I couldn't go wrong with anything! Welp! Here we go- The noodles were on point. They were probably my favorite. The rice was very salty. I feel like it had a lot of soy sauce. The Cashew Chicken had snap peas, carrots and zucchini. It was very tasty! I would definitely order this again. My husband who had the Kung Pao chicken said it was good but not spectacular. The egg rolls were pretty good. I would rate his place a 3.5 star if I could but with my husbands feedback I'll have to go with a 3. Ha! We do want to go back and try other dishes- since I was a walk in lots of food was being brought to tables and they did look appetizing!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and come here for their lunch or dinner combos instead of the same old Panda Express. The portions are definitely good size and it's made fresh and hot to order just for you. The sauces have good flavor and the vegetables are not over cooked. The egg rolls come out crispy and hot all the way through and the egg drop soup is pretty good! The only negative is the cleanliness of the windows and the window treatments otherwise it's pretty clean in the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"I started ordering from this restaurant since they opened.  The food is great however we place a take out order yesterday, when we went to pick up our food we observed one of the staff members digging for gold in his nose while serving food.  There were several other staff members behind the counter we made the other staff aware.  Needless to say we will not be eating here again.  Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese I've had in Arizona. Really clean place with friendly counter girls. I recommend this place to all my friends and family. Dinner combos are a great deal and you get a TON of food."}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese food restaurant!! I am so happy we tried this place. The food is very good and the lunch special prices for all you get rice, your choice of meat, wonton, egg roll and choice of hot n sour or egg drop soup for $5.95 is awesome. Love the BBQ pork fried rice!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. They started the lunch combo with egg drop soup. It was the best egg drop soup I've ever tasted.  Clean environment and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Came here with my family not knowing what to expect. I was thinking it was going to be a straight fast food place. I was wrong, wok Wei is much more then that. 

Wok Wei has a welcoming environment, sit relax and have good food. Perfect for when u wanna relax with friends or family. Good food, good price and friendly staff. Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"While it isn't the Chinese food we used to eat in Chinatown in San Francisco it is pretty good by Arizona standards.

We eat here quite often and always enjoy the food and have not had a bad meal. Glad it is so close to our house as it makes takeout easy.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I picked their \"Americanized\" fare and it was quite nice.  Nice enough for me to come back and try their more authentic-sounding dishes.  I'm excited.

The food is not too salty.  I mean it's salty for sure but I wasn't downing my water like I usually do at, say, Pei Wei's.  

The combination portion is quite generous.  Both my husband and I had some leftover and it was plenty of food to make one more meal (and a generous portion at that!)

So I definitely recommend their broccoli beef and tofu with veggies in brown sauce.  My only complaint was the fried shrimp I got for my daughter tasted like it had been fried in old oil.  It wasn't horrible but I think reaching the point where they should really change the oil out for a fresh batch.  That might've just been timing on our part."}
{"text":"Restaurant looked clean, staff was friendly, and price was pretty good. That being said the sesame chicken was so-so.  It was somewhat spongy for my taste and the fried rice was not what I expected.  I would probably not come here again for that item."}
{"text":"Great food in a nice,  almost upscale atmosphere.  Attentive, but not annoying service.  

I had the kung pao chicken which was spiced perfectly. Like that slow burn,  hurts so good level but not burning your lips off hot. Really nice portion sizes and the egg roll,  cheese puff and egg drop soup are all nice included additions. 

What's amazing is the price! $5.95 lunch special makes if almost too good to be true... But it is. 

Needless to say, I'll be back."}
{"text":"The Husband and I went here for a quick dinner on a Wednesday night around 8pm.  We were seated right away, it wasn't crowded.  Service was extremely fast, yet everything tasted fresh.  I ordered the Sesame chicken and white rice.  My Hubby got the same, but the full meal, which came with egg rolls, soup and also noodles of some sort. He usually cleans his plate and eats whatever is left on mine, but even he couldn't finish his plate.  It was SOOO much food!  My chicken alone fed both of us the next day and we even had enough for my grandma to make a small plate.  I loved the flavors and loved the fact that pretty much every dish is made with white meat chicken....No mystery meat here!  I also ordered a To-Go order of combination fried rice with shrimp, pork and chicken to have for lunch the next day.  It was excellent.  We'll definitely go back!  Can't beat speedy service and good food!"}
{"text":"For sure the best Chinese food in the west valley no doubt about it. The quality of the food for the quantity and price is something you find once in a lifetime. The tenderness to crispness ratio for the orange chicken makes Panda Express look like they're serving chicken nuggets. Not only do they provide the entree but they always give you the dankest egg drop soup with sweet and sour sauce. I'm originally from Tempe but my boys and I will drive 45 min just to eat at this establishment. The only negative thing I have to say about this joint is that they always assume I want brown rice. They will however always fix this for you without complaint."}
{"text":"Orange chicken is my favorite and there lunch specials are very generous as most Chinese food places for about $6. One of my top 3 for when I'm in search of Chinese food on the west valley to go."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the west valley.  I've been there twice.  Great flavor, nice portion sizes..  I recommend it to anyone who's looking for great Chinese food!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I've tried in so long! I always get the combo, which brings a side of rice, chow-mien, your choice of entree, an egg roll and a cream cheese puff and even your choice of soup! BIG servings too! Good food :)"}
{"text":"Best place for fresh Chinese food.  Moved out to the West Valley over 2 years ago and could not find anything good until this Place.  Good food, portions and service.  Also a note you can still get all the sides with your dinner combo and not just the entree with rice.  We come here at lest 3 times a month. Thank you"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Fantastic take out service, fast, friendly and the order is always spot on. General Tso's chicken is my fave, the wife loves their Beef Broccoli and this has quickly supplanted the artist formerly known as Panda Express down the street.

Skip the Panda and wok your wei to this wonderful chinese cuisine!"}
{"text":"Just returned from California where I had some amazing wor wonton soup, so was trying to find some around here. Well it did not happen. It was watery and flavorless. My hubby had a chicken dish of similar quality. The waitress was nice, the reason for 2 stars.  His ordered dish had everything on one plate, which was very small portion. I have had larger portions for same price at other Chinese restaurants. I don't think we will be returning , still searching for the elusive tasty wor wonton soup."}
{"text":"We came here when we were visiting my brother and sister in law in AZ. I had the won ton soup, and it was pretty good. My husband got the orange chicken which he liked too. I liked that it was easy to get a table, and that all of us were able to sit without bothering others since we had two little children with us. The waitress was really attentive and did her job well. I would come back again."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Chinese food. We absolutely love it!  The dinner combos are a lot of food for your money. I haven't tried anything that I did not like. My family loves the orange chicken and the sesame chicken. I like chicken and mushrooms, moo goo gai pan, and chicken and broccoli because of all of the fresh veggies they put in it like zucchini and carrots. This is the kind of Chinese food you eat, and you feel good after eating it. Not like places with all the greasiness. The staff is nice too."}
{"text":"Best orange chicken & cream cheese puffs ever! 
Always fast, friendly, and delicious."}
{"text":"Good food. Generous portions. We had the dinner for two. Wife had shrimp & vegetables, and I had the beef with vegetables. Very good, as was the egg drop soup. Took home enough for a 2nd meal each. Two sauces provided, too, on the side for dipping. Only bad thing was their appetizers. Egg rolls? Didn't care for them at all. The pork ribs were just fatty and full of gristle. We did like the crab puffs. So a couple of the appetizers were disappointing but we loved the main dishes and the crab puffs. We'd definitely eat there again and just avoid those two appetizers. Main dishes were very good and again, large portions."}
{"text":"Love the orange chicken. It's a huge portion like no joke it can feed your whole family!"}
{"text":"New to the area and needed to find a place that I could get my Chinese fix. Their egg drop soup and jalapeño chicken is great."}
{"text":"We're newish to the area and came across this restaurant a few months ago. We've dinned in, and had takeout. Really good food, excellent service, big portions, and very affordable!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I always get the sweet and sour chicken entree because I love the steamed white rice. The chicken, pineapple and vegetables are so yummy. They're very quick with take out orders and the employees are very nice. Their answering machine still says Merry Christmas we're closed. Hopefully they fixed that"}
{"text":"Typical, charges us a 18% gratuity for my wife, friend, 2 kids and I.  Will never even think about coming back here! 18% for what. 18% for 5 and more. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Food was great!!! Loved the egg drop soup!!!! Sorry that's all I ate, so can't rate anything else on food..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and they always have bad attitudes.When I ask for something they always answer so aggressively. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"First thing walking in was how clean the dinning area was. Staff greeted me and were very friendly. Food was great and would definitely be back here again. Only downside...dirty bathrooms!"}
{"text":"First off, the good parts.  The food was hot, portions were large, and the food (for valley chinese food) was great.  We had a the beef and broccoli dinner and the spicy garlic broccoli dinner.  The lo mein didn't taste burnt like it does at some many other valley chinese restaurants.  The egg drop soup was the best we've had out here and didn't have weird vegetables swimming in it - in particular the broth was neither goopy nor runny, it was just right.  The garlic broccoli has a huge garlic punch which is what we've been looking for ever since we moved out west.  The beef and broccoli had a nice brown sauce that wasn't gelatinous/gummy like we've run across out west.  The puffs did not have crab but I think they were just advertised as cheese puffs - oh, they were good too, the cheese was actually melted inside for a change.  
What keeps it for being a 5 star review for me?  The egg rolls, although being similar to the style i'm used to back east and avoiding that mushy filling so many places carry out here, had an odd taste to them.  I think they add nutmeg or something similar to the cabbage mixture inside.  I didn't mind it too much but the wife didn't like it at all - it was a bizarre taste (like i had eaten a bite of pumpkin pie beforehand and had the aftertaste on my mouth still).  The other problem was that at first it seemed like we were intruding upon their \"down time\". We arrived in that \"in-between\" hour where it's after lunch but before dinner and the staff seriously didn't seem too pleased we were in there. They were more friendly at the end of the meal but it was a bizarre feeling to say the least initially.  
Anyway, overall, probably our go-to dine-in option in the valley (we go to Lim's if we want buffet style).  Please give them a try!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!! My husband and I had jalapeño chicken and beef with broccoli. Both dishes were made fresh to order and tasted amazing. Great value lunch spot because the prices are unbeatable. The waiter was a very attentive and pleasant man who constantly kept our drinks refilled. I dropped my fork on the floor and he immediately came and offered me a clean one. I will definitely have lunch here again before leaving town :)"}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Chinese place on this side of town... The orange chicken was some of the best I've ever had. It's thinly sliced chicken and lightly battered and fried. Then they add the orange sauce. All combos come with rice, low mien, egg roll and cream cheese Rangoon. Prices are comparable and you can actually see the kitchen while they cook your food."}
{"text":"Great food, great portions with fast service! The word is getting out about this hidden gem and I can only assume it will need to move to a larger location because they are starting to really bring in the business and their current location is quite small."}
{"text":"Great food and plenty of it! This was our first time there and my wife, daughter and I were very pleased! It was reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"In a word: Delicious!

Finally a good Chinese restaurant in the west valley! The flavors are fantastic. I haven't eaten such good Chinese food since I moved to Arizona 9 years ago. I will definitely come back and recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Not good unless you're starving and there's no Chinese food within 10 miles!!!

Brand new place, 1st visit, ordered 3 dinner items to go.

The bad:   2x cooked pork was ok, sweet and sour chicken breading tasted like plastic, plum sauce was like store-bought-bottled and bad tasting, beef and broccoli had so much oyster sauce in the mix it was too salty to eat.

The good:  Large portion size, prices a bit high but ok for location.

There's a place right across the street with much better food albeit way smaller portions.

I might give this place a 2nd chance and try other options... maybe!

The ugly: go starving and love \"buffet style flavored\" chinese food or eat elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Delish!!! We went here for the first time and loved it! I'm kind of bummed we've never gone and we live so close!!! If you love Chinese food, you'll love this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, large servings. I got the chicken low mein and it was yummy. We left our leftovers on the table I called and they hung on to them until my husband got back. Would return."}
{"text":"Just discovered this great place for Asian food.  The service was super and the food was exceptional. We ended bringing a to-go box home and enjoyed it for lunch the next day!  We will go there again soon for dinner!"}
{"text":"A nice little find.


I  discovered Wok Wei  Asian Cuisine when I was searching for a Chinese restaurant on the West Side of town .  I thought to myself,  who would know of a good place to grab a quick bite to eat, the answer was simple, my fellow \"yelpers\" and my fellow \"yelpers\" were right Wok Wei Asian Cuisine was a nice little find.

From the time we entered the restaurant and received a warm welcome to the \"Please come again\" as we left out experience at Wok Wei was very pleasant. The menu offers a wide choice of dishes wuch includes lunch and dinner specials.  All the food is fresh and excellent tasting, and the portions are large, I mean really large.  You get a great deal for your money!

The service is very fast and friendly. Wok Wei has both booths and tables and they have take out. Finally a good Asian restaurant in the west valley that is going to stay around."}
{"text":"Went for lunch here with my boyfriend. We had the egg rolls, shrimp lo mein and the mushroom chicken lunch special. The portions were large, and everything tastes wonderful! The shrimp in the lo mein were large, quality shrimp. The chicken in the mushroom chicken was very tender and the said was awesome! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is really good. The portions are big and the souo was great. This is my new go to Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Asian food. I'm also a little picky about it. This place has become my favorite! And it's been a very long time since I've been able to find such a place. There is nothing on the menu that I'm not a fan of. I eat there at least once a week at this point. Seriously good stuff!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a long day at work for a late evening dinner. We were greeted almost immediately.  I ordered General Tso chicken combo. It came with egg drrop soup which was some of the best I have had. It ctame with cheese puffs, egg roll, fried rice and lomein.  A huge and tasty meal. The wife got a bowl of wonton soup.  It was huge and full of shrimp, veggies and lots of wontons.  Overall a very good meal at a reasonable price. We will be back."}
{"text":"I adore Wok Wei and their beautiful service. The food is amazing and I have not once had an awful experience there."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Friday !!!! 
Best orange chicken I've ever eaten. 
Also service is great, portions are huge over all food is soo good. 
My new favorite Chinese place!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place the house noodle soup, egg drop and sizzle fried rice are all amazing. All combos are very feeling.
Customer Service is Excellent"}
{"text":"If you want orange chicken, here's a place to do it \"local\"!

Decent price and fresh compared to a nearby chain, for example... 

Had the General Tso. It wasn't spicy, which would have been preferred, but I like that it's all white meat chicken and am looking forward to going back and trying some other dishes. I'll just be sure to tell them I want it \"spicy!\" :)"}
{"text":"The best orange chicken entree. So much food for the $. Great service. Been there several times. Always take home food or have enough to share. Love this place"}
{"text":"Disappointed. I ordered a combination plate and rib appetizer to go. When I opened the container a few miles away the egg roll and cream cheese wontons were missing, and the ribs were more American than Chinese. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Ohhhh Wok Wei how I constantly crave your orange chicken!

Have eaten here probably 6 times now and never disappointed.  Usually get the orange chicken that is not only filled with orange flavor but an amazing garlic flavor as well that is simply just delicious and perfect every time.  The menu says it is spicy but I have never tasted the heat with this dish so don't worry about that.  If you order the dinner combo it is like $1.50 more for lo mein noodles, a cheese ragoon, and egg roll which are all worth it.

The pineapple fried rice is also a favorite!  I always want to try something new here but cant bring myself to missing out on the delicious orange chicken!

Very reasonably priced as well and if you dine in during lunch time they have great prices on lunch specials for a large portion of food!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend eating here. We ordered orange beef, general chicken, and beef and broccoli. All great choices. The food was fresh and service was excellent, I'd definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Fast, courteous and delicious food! Every time we go we order something different and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always awesome, great service. Jalapeno chicken is delicious. It's perfectly crunchy with a little sweet heat. The prices are low and the portions are huge. Always enough to take home. We have be regulars for 2 years."}
{"text":"Great food. Got the general's chicken and wasn't disappointed. Much better than Pei Wei or Panda. Good to have a local Chinese place that I can go to."}
{"text":"Large food portions make lunch more attractive to me, however, the Jalapeño Chicken is worth it either way, as it goes home well. Sides are also good, and price easily beats Pei Wei, which I think is comparative"}
{"text":"great chinese food!! not the cookie cutter chinese cuisine like every other place that is opening up. I will definitely be making this one of my regular stops. would highly recommend this spot!!"}
{"text":"My test of an Asian restaurant is whether they can make good fried rice and hot and sour soup.  Both are pretty easy, use simple ingredients but take some skill and technique to do well.  

Wok Wei serves both done right.  Fried rice is smoky from the hot wok, cooked to order and is a great comfort food.   Hot and sour soup was full of tasty meats and vegetables including the traditional lily buds.  I would have liked it a little more spicy and sour, but that is being a bit picky.  Their soup is almost as good as I make.  I enjoyed both.  

The spicy foods are quite tame, Americanized for the local market.  Next time I'll ask to kick it up a notch.  It is a bit noisy with blazing woks in the open kitchen.   There is a noticeable decrease in noise when the flame thrower burners are turned off between orders.  

Generally, I have enjoyed everything so far."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken lo mien during lunch. It's served with egg drop soup, a egg roll and cheese puff. When I got my soup I saw a small bug inside so I showed the lady and she offered to bring me another one. It was really good! About 3 minutes later my food was brought to me. The food was average. I don't know if I will be going back."}
{"text":"The food was not what I would have expected.  The sesame chicken had way too much sauce and the chicken itself was soggy and not flavored properly.  the egg rolls were delicious and just about the only thing on the menu that I would ever order again.  The rice was bland and the noodles were over salted."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch. Great lunch menu specials. Clean, quick service. Food was hot and excellent with more than enough for lunch,"}
{"text":"The food is great. 
Staff is friendly and smiles are plenty. 
And the price is just right. 

Would come again for sure."}
{"text":"Nice place, good service, great bang for the buck, and good food as well. Have been back several times for both lunch and dinner. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really good food, good service, nice clean place.. happy this was by the hotel I was staying at.. definitely worth a try if your ever in This area.."}
{"text":"Food was bland.  Previous yelper said it tasted like buffet food and it did.  Good lunch prices but rather spend more for better food. Restaurant was nice and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Fried rice soaked in soy sauce. Service sucked, worst Chinese food in AZ. The waitress didn't refill drinks or check on us."}
{"text":"Delicious orange chicken. The restaurant is clean, welcoming, and very open. They are very polite here and food is good and well served."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now, 3 lunch and one dinner. Each visit was great.  Staff are quick and to the point, food is always cooked to order.  Week definitely come back. Each time I've gone I have ordered something with a spicy symbol next to it azgfd it wasn't spicy.  So don't worry, just try it."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The portions are huge, the price is right and the food is absolutely delicious. I got the sesame chicken combo, the chicken was absolutely perfect! All white meat chicken breast with tasty sesame sauce! The fried rice is great along with the lo mein and the portions are very large. The egg roll and cheese puff are a great addition!"}
{"text":"This place is so dope. I literally could not stop eating until everything was gone. The takeout is really good but it's like super good when you actually go and sit down. Those pot stickers omg they're so good. I can't believe I ate the whole thing. Cause they give you a lot of food for cheap."}
{"text":"This is different Chinese from what I'm used too, but I like it. My favorites are the potstickers, the kung psi chicken and the sesame chicken. I almost always do carry out and they get it done fast even if I don't call ahead."}
{"text":"Service and food were so good! Food portions were def up to par with price! I only been visited once due to the distance but i will def return when I am around the area. 

ordered the salt pepper shrimp (extra spicy) and it did not disappoint! I loved it!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this gets almost 5 stars the food is not good at all sorry I feel bad for posting this because I hate giving bad reviews but this was a disappointment. The ladies serving were nice but that's about it because the price was way too high for the quality."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in the area  The only complaint I have is their fried rice. The fried rice I've had has egg and a lot of other stuff in it this is just rice BUT every time I come here the food is consistently AMAZING"}
{"text":"YES!!! Finally a delicious Chinese restaurant on the west side!! I have been looking so long!! The noodles, spring rolls and cheese won tons were to die for!! They have amazing deals for lunch that you have to order some takeout! I came with my sis on a weekend and it wasn't packed at all. We got speedy service and a friendly waitress. I can't wait to take the hubs here. :-) 

I would recommend the noodles and won tons. Two thumbs high up!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered take out from this place many times and it's always been very good and with decent portions. The staff is also very friendly and efficient, both on the phone when taking our order and when I go to pick it up. The atmosphere for dining there seems fine as well, but we just choose to eat it at home.  Would totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place on the west side by far. Huge portions and a good value. Love the Mongolian beef combo !"}
{"text":"The food here is great ! The orange chicken is AMAZING ! The Kung Pao chicken was good also. The booths are nice and roomy which is good if you have lil ones. The server we had was really rude, I felt very uncomfortable drinking my soda because she was mad when I asked for my one and only refill. If you can try and avoid the server with glasses. We most likely won't come back just because of that. But if you don't mind bad service this place is great."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place, but it was a disappointment.  We ordered the Mongolian Beef and Sesame Chicken combos to go and neither were any good. The Mongolian Beef was the worst I've ever tasted, and the Sesame Chicken was eh just so so.  There was a good portion of each, although I was looking forward to trying the lo mein and fried rice which are included in the combos. Not impressed at all. The cheese puffs that were also included were good, tasted like mini crab Rangoons without the crab, but the egg rolls were disgusting.  Kind of sad because there are no decent Chinese food places in the West Valley and I have been craving it for awhile."}
{"text":"We've ordered takeout once and dined in once.  The first time (takeout) the hostess was extremely rude to my husband and basically yelled at him for taking too long to come pick up the food.  The food was ok, everything kind of tasted the same.  We decided to dine in to try it out and again, hostess (same lady...perhaps the owner?) was very unfriendly.  We ordered tea for the table (which they charge for when usually it is complimentary) expecting a pot and cute little tea cups (my kids love that) but no...just a regular coffee mug filled with tea for each, including my 6 year old who then didn't want to drink it but we still got charged. 
The food portions are very large, especially the combo.  But the flavor is lacking and the service was not good.  Why do they have e to be so unfriendly!  
There's a lot of these types of Chinese food places around here and after 2 below average experiences I won't be returning here soon."}
{"text":"We ate here last Wednesday for the first time. Finding myself on my own tonight, I decided to go for takeout. I ordered the broccoli beef and it was DELICIOUS!! Lots of beef and broccoli in a yummy sauce.  Plus the serving size was enough for dinner and lunch tomorrow. This will definitely be our go to Asian place! I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"We were very pleased with everything. All ingredients were fresh. They serve huge amounts of food. The dinner combos come with egg roll cream cheese puffs lo mein with fried rice. We also got a free order of chicken fried rice.  Our dishes that had chicken was made with chicken breast. That's a plus. I ordered the chicken with veg in white garlic sauce. It was very tasty. Veggies were perfectly cooked still had the fresh crunch but cooked enough where you can taste the name of the dish. Spicy orange chicken was good wasn't overly sweet but had a light kick of the chili flakes. Chicken jalapeño was a little spicy but spicy enough for the person that likes some heat. Chicken and mushroom was really good too.  No can mushrooms used here. I really hope this place sticks around. I like Chinese food and panda express does not do it for me. Yans is near but I am not a fan. All  good Chinese places are ridiculously far. Now maybe I am overly excited to welcome this new establishment but who cares. Give these guys a try maybe for lunch  it's a few bucks cheaper. Let's help keep them in the community. We honestly need something different out here. I will go back. If my experience is any different I will yelp about it."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time tonight. Ordered take out. I had the chicken and vegetable entree with brown rice. The chicken was tender and the vegetables were fresh and cooked perfectly. Sauce was savory and delicious. I also had the pot stickers (pan fried) and I loved them! I usually don't like pot stickers but theirs had a nice light filling and they weren't greasy. The dipping sauce was good as well. My husband had the sweet and sour chicken entree and said it was great. He also liked their cheese puffs. The only thing I didn't like was the egg drop soup. But everything else was so good, we will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Very consistent, fresh and great food at a very reasonable price. My favorite place to go in Goodyear."}
{"text":"I would definitely give them a 4.5 if I could, more than a 4, but just shy of a 5!  Overall I was super impressed with this little Chinese food establishment, they had wonderful food, were quick in getting our order out to us, and the price was very nice as well...a perfect place for lunch!  

My friends and I came here for lunch because its close to where our other girlfriend works, and she only had an hour to spare.  As soon as we got seated we got our menus and put our orders in.  I got their Orange Chicken lunch special, which came with a bowl of soup, fried rice, an egg roll, a cream cheese won ton, and of course orange chicken.  And I believe the price was under $10 for all that food...wow!!  Great prices!  

We got our soup first, and it was good, I got Hot-and-Sour, and it was really good, typical, but good!  Not long after we got our food, and to my surprise the orange chicken looked different than it usually does...not as much breading, just sauce and chicken...and it was EXCELLENT!  Definitely some of the best Orange Chicken I have EVER had!  Very impressed by that!  It was awesome, I would come back to Wok Wei anytime for their Orange Chicken!   

The only reason they got 4 stars instead of 5 is because their fried rice wasn't the best...it was OK, but there was just too much soy sauce and it tasted like it wasn't cooked enough...a minor flaw, it was still edible, just not the best.  Their egg rolls and won tons were awesome though, I would definitely get more of those!   

As for the service, it was very prompt, we got our food right away, and were out of there with time to spare to get Mary back to work!  I would definitely come back here again for Chinese food, especially for lunch, if we are back in the area!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food ever!  I've been there plenty of times on Saturday night and the place was packed.  The Orange chicken is awesome and the walnut shrimp is huge and very flavorful.  They give you a TON of food.  The lunch specials are the best 7 days a week they give you very large portions on the entrees with rice, lo mein, egg roll, wontons and soup you will take some home!  Everything is cooked fresh and served piping hot! They also offer ordering online they are fast and efficient so you won't wait long at all.  Service is great!  I must say I've eaten out most of my adult life 40 years plus now and I've never had any server ask me if I'd like my check split ever even in large parties so I really don't see that as being any kind of an issue. Prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Wok Wei is great, food is way better than any Chinese buffet, prices are reasonable. Since moving to Goodyear, we've become regular customers there."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! By far probably my favorite asian cuisine spot in AZ. We just moved here from LA where they have a million great options, so can safe to say say this gave me my \"fix\". Portion size is amazing. The orange chicken is probably one of the best I've ever tried! Must must MUST try! You will not be disappointed;)"}
{"text":"Our go-to place when we're craving good Chinese food. They have generous portions and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"So glad there's finally a good Asian restaurant in the area! There are 2 places across the street, but they are not good at all. One of those is a chain restaurant and is horrible. Wok Wei is very fresh and the wait for your food is just as long as the other places. I won't eat anywhere else ever again. This place is the best! 

The staff are so friendly and very polite. We've become regulars there and they are sure to make you feel special. I have seen other people there that are so happy with the restaurant that they bring friends. They're going to have to get a bigger place soon with all the business that they are generating. 

I highly recommend coming here for lunch or dinner. They have take out, too! We like to stay and eat because the soups are so good. The food is very filling and we even have leftovers. The vegetables are very fresh and the meat is good quality. The combo meals are the best deal. We have a great experience every time we go."}
{"text":"We thought this place was amazing for the price and the amount of food you get. 

We both ordered the entrees that come with soup, Spring Roll, Puffy thing, brown, white, or fried rice, AND Chow Mein! My veggie meal was $9.20 and Hubby's was just over $10, including an extra $1 for the brown rice.

Food was delicious and I think we took more home than we ate. I love warmed up Chinese or Indian food, and this did not disappoint.

I'd recommend this place and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Came by at 830 and they said because the next day is a holiday they are closed and would not serve us. There were 4-5 tables there and they refused to serve us. We asked what about Togo orders and they said depends on what you want. So we opted to leave and they lost our business!"}
{"text":"Come here regularly. Usually for lunch because their lunch combos are great! Super cheap and the food is good. You get soup, the entree, rice, a spring roll and cheese puff. I love the orange and lemon chicken. Would redinitely recommend. Service has definitely improved since my first visit."}
{"text":"Was here last week and am back again! You cannot beat the quality, amount, and price! The food is top notch and one combo is more than enough for two people if you add an appetizer. Attentive service and quality food - throw in the price and you will see me here at least once a month."}
{"text":"This restaurant s just so very good. It's kind of pricy, but in my opinion it is well worth it. As I have complained in the past, Arizona has very little to offer in the way of Chinese food. I have traveled far and wide and have had very good Chinese food. I became spoiled, after experiencing what other states have to offer. I used to really like certain places here in the valley, but after leaving the state, I found out what I was missing out on. This place is the closest I've come to decent Chinese food. The staff is really friendly and boy do hey work fast. Now only if their prices were a little lower and they delivered to Surprise, we'd be in business. Keep up the good work Wok Wei (translation: Walk Way) lol"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Wok Wei for awhile. It was very good. The lunch menu has a great variety and was a nice portion of food. I had the sweet and sour pork and it was really good. The breading was not too thick, it had a nice amount of bell peppers and pineapple, the egg drop soup was good, plus you get an egg roll and a cream cheese wonton. The only reason it's 4 stars is I didn't think the rice was that great."}
{"text":"This place is actually very good! I've been here twice, both times I got the walnut shrimp on the chef specials. It taste amazing. The only complaint my husband and I had was the rice is American rice. We're both asian and thought, \"why on earth does a chinese restaurant have American rice?!\" And the egg roll is too salty. But everything else is great including the customer service and cleanliness!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Very good, fresh food! Clean, upscale decor. 

The food was all fresh cooked to order. Seasoned just right, except for the egg rolls, which I thought were a bit too peppery. Overall, very delicious. My favorite was the fried shrimp. Not rubbery as most places serve it. Nothing tasted greasy, even the fried foods.

Large quantity served, so come hungry or prepare to take home lot's of leftovers. 

Our server was very sweet and got the order right. Kept our water and tea glasses full. 

They display an A rating from the health dept., and it shows. You can see the kitchen from the dining area, and it looks very clean.

Reasonable prices. We paid $40 for dinner for two, including tip, and we took home enough for another meal.

This is a new place so they don't have a beer/wine license yet."}
{"text":"Ok this was our first visit. Here's the deal:

The service is incredibly slow and the waitresses are running around like crazy and in no way engage you. You have to grab them when they come by if you need anything. 

The food is very good. Portions are huge. Not big, but huge. I know how to throw down on some grub,  but the plates must've weighed 4lbs each. Appetizers are not needed. We ate the sampler, but after getting our meal we regretted it due to the amazingly large portions. 

Did I mention the service was non existent? Seriously..."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for an early dinner and it was our first time! Our waitress was extremly friendly and kind as well... i had the orange chicken which is breaded and simply amazing! We will for sure be back with our little dude... 1 word for this resturant DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch special of General Tsos chicken....I dont know what's changed but it tastes like shit! The dish is supposed to have chicken..its nothing bit balls of flour tossed in the sauce. The rice is supposed to be fried rice....its white rice colored brown with who knows what. I'm disappointed and will not be returning ever again to this place. AJK is way better than this."}
{"text":"Despite overwhelmingly great reviews, the place was nearly empty on a Saturday night.  I was part of a large party of 8 adults and 2 children.

Food was very good, prices reasonable and generous portions.

My only complaint is that we weren't asked if we wanted the check split up at the beginning.  This caused a delay after our meal for them to divide up the checks."}
{"text":"Delicious and in the neighborhood! Our old chinese take out location has gone down hill and happy to find a new favorite. Everything we have gotten here is good. portions are really large, great for sharing with a family!"}
{"text":"Great location in Goodyear. Restaurant was clean indoors and outdoors. We were seated right away by a young waitress who was very quick, kind and zero mistake. My girl ordered veggie fried rice and veggie lo mein. She also had my egg drop soup and liked it. She was very satisfied!

For an appetizer, I ordered pan fried chicken potstickers. The potstickers were average. They weren't as juicy, tender and warm as expected. For my main entree, I got the orange chicken dinner combo which came with fried rice, lo mein, one egg roll and two crab puffs. All were delicious. The orange chicken is thinly sliced and the sauce is uniquely delicious. The lo mein has the be the best I've had, EVER!

Staff works hard here and their proud of he business. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for a good Chinese place. Decided to give Wok Wei a try. I ordered the Sweet & Sour Pork combo which came with fried rice, lo mein, egg drop soup, an egg roll, and 2 cheese puffs. The soup came out quickly and it was pretty good. I was about halfway done with the soup when the entrees came out. Surprising how fast it was! The pork and chicken were your average battered balls of meat. The Sesame Chicken my other half ordered had a good sauce. The noodles weren't bad. The fried rice was plain & nothing special. The egg rolls were very peppery... lots of visible black pepper in the filling. Had plenty of leftovers to take home and eat over the next couple days. So it was a good experience overall, but I can't say I've found my go-to Chinese place. The search continues..."}
{"text":"Food was excellent HOWEVER was totally disappointed when they allowed a couple in with their dog!!!!! isn't that some sort of code violation?!?!? Not impressed!!!"}
{"text":"House egg foo young was outstanding.  Chicken lo mien delicious.  Sweet sour pork not that great."}
{"text":"Think of Panda Express with table service.  The food is cheap with lunch specials under $6 that include soup, cheese puff, egg roll, rice, and a entrée.  They have these specials daily, even on the weekends. The food was so-so, it's fresher than Panda Express, but I'm not sure if it is any better."}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese restaurant! The food is incredibly delicious, fast on the take out and even while dining in. Staff is nice and the prices are reasonable. Would highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I can find in AZ. It is made to order quickly cooked on hi temp. Never greasy and good cuts of meat. Not fatty at all. The lunch special is great. Lots on the menu and it comes with soup, egg roll and cream cheese wonton."}
{"text":"Location is very clean! I recommend the Orange Chicken! The food is always hot and fresh. Portions are large and affordable. The service is good too, we regularly come here and they remember a lot of our preferences. Would recommend this to family or friends."}
{"text":"I recommend there orange chicken and Mongolian beef probably one of my top 5 Asian restaurants"}
{"text":"Worst service they never check up on you if you need more drink and food was alright. Only saw our waitress once when she brought us our food and after two pick up her check."}
{"text":"My new fave Chinese food place in my area. Clean. Fast and great service. Take out general tso's chicken lunch special. Comes with egg roll, cheese puff, and had the egg drop soup as I wait since take out doesn't include soup, brown rice for addl $1. W/ large soda total was $9. The food is delicious and highly recommend to others!"}
{"text":"My daughter said to give them a 4.5. We found this place on yelp at the last minute. The food was fresh and delicious! The portion sizes are pretty good. You could definitely split an entree combo between two people. We will be returning here again!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner. It is a casual restaurant setting all new and very clean. The service was good and quick. I ordered the sesame chicken combo which came with soup to start and the chicken, rice and chow mein. It also came with an egg roll and two cheese wontons that were really good. The portions were large which I love because that gives me enough for lunch the next day. The prices were reasonable and the good was as good as anything in the area. They also offer take out."}
{"text":"Best Chineese food in the west valley.... You know what? I'm going to go as far as saying, in all of Arizona!!!! There I said it. I can't believe it was so close to where I live for a year and a half and I never tried it. ITS A MUST!!!"}
{"text":"Would have given 5 stars except for the the fact the server didn't pay attention.  We ordered an appetizer, the assorted platter,  and a couple of the items were overcooked and dry.   We told her we would order after as we were in no hurry.  So, we ordered our meal and while we were eating our soup she brings the main course.  Felt rushed!! She needs to pay attention to the customers.   She brought the check before we were done.  Asked for togo boxes and they were so small we could hardly get it all in without stacking different items on top of each other.  The food was good and if we lived in the area we would go back."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food on the west side! Old school food just like i like it. Best eggrolls, low mein and sweet and sour pork."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst people work here!!! The man at the register didn't realize the people ahead of me let me go before them bc they didn't know what they wanted yet. I try to order and this man totally ignores me, walks passed me as I'm telling him they let me go before them and asks them what they want. Then gets an attitude with me after realizing he's wrong and cusses under his bad breath! I call him out on it and the man denies it!!!!!! Classic"}
{"text":"Really do you like this place. We order takeout from here all the time. It is some of the best Chinese food in the West Valley. Their hot and sour soup is amazing. Their beef with broccoli is spot on. And the kids love the chicken fried rice. Your lunch special is really good and super inexpensive."}
{"text":"Definitely Asian not Chinese. Have yet to order something we didn't like. The combo's are the way to go for the money. General tso's is our favorite. Clean place also."}
{"text":"Man I must have lost my taste for Chinese food or something, I just can't seem to find a decent one on the west side to save my life, and with all of the great reviews on here I was sure this place would hit the spot. The food was so-so, towards the end though it just wasn't appetizing and I couldn't finish a lot of my meal. I hate give a poor review because the staff was very friendly and polite even though the time we came in was super busy lunch rush. My default at any Asian Restaurant is usually Sweet &Sour chicken, but I wanted to try something different here. Pineapple chicken sounded so appetizing. The vegetable used were very fresh but the \"house sauce\" they smother it in was very sour tasting and got gelatinous rather quickly. I began to pour sweet and sour sauce and mix it in to give it some life and edible flavor. Lo me in and rice we're just..meh I was kinda bummed. Oh well...the search continues!"}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff, and great value for the money. We had lunch there and we enjoyed the orange chicken and the general tso chicken. Both very good. We will be back."}
{"text":"So. Fracking. Good. This is my go to when I want amazing Kung Pao or Orange chicken. I've been here 15+ times since they've opened, and I've only had one or two times where the meat was a little chewy or fatty which is pretty good in my opinion.  Their cream cheese wontons are fantastic, and their chicken fried rice with their Kung Pao sauce is addicting."}
