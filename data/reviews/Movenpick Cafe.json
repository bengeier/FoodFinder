{"text":"Very cozy place, friendly staff and great pastries.
I got a tea, pistachio macron and Spanish and cheese they were all delicious.
The atmosphere is amazing and the staff were so kind ..
I loved this place a lot. And will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"The cafe is on the corner of Wellington and Yonge. You can also access it from the Marché. Atmosphere is great 4/5. It reminds me of a quaint little french bistro. 

However, the food is horrid. The quiche was hard and chewy with no taste. You can tell it was leftover from the day before. I tried a piece of cake to get the taste of the quiche out of my mouth and it was stale. It had clearly been refrigerated repeatedly. The buttercream has the taste and smell of the fridge! I had to return it.

I think the food at this place is mostly leftovers from the Marché restaurant. Shame! I would come back, but just for coffee and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim, so thoroughly impressed with both the cappuccino and the bistro sandwich. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe at the corner with adorable seating. I enjoy the teas they have to offer as well as the strawberry cream cheese muffin. One of go to coffee places in toronto."}
{"text":"You'd think there would be more vegetarian options with this many food stations. I tried the ravioli which was pretty good but not great and really heavy in that stick-in-your-throat kind of way. Cool spot but I wouldn't make it a habit."}
{"text":"Not your ordinary cafe. 

It has this \"I'm in Paris\" vibe to it. I LOVE IT! The service is exceptional. 

I always bring all my clients here and they are always impressed with this place. 

However, it is better to walk to this cafe as it can be tough for you to find a parking spot. It's in heart of downtown after all. 

Ambience - 5/5
Service - 6/5
Food (& Drinks) - 6/5"}
{"text":"I am Swiss and for me it is a cult place. Just like home, good service, fantastic birchermusli."}
{"text":"Designed like a buffet with the prices of fine dining its simply a rip off dressed up as an european experience...the salad bar is pathetic and if you want to add some  meat expect the price to double...the steaks hanging in the showcase had black spots, which made me not want to know whats living on the chicken or seafood...the lamb shank was average, the ham definitely below that...the rosti were undercooked at too low a temperature, no one in germany would eat what they served here...the panacotta  was not really panacotta and the chocolate mousse was mediocre at best...
people forget that in europe this is just one of the better truck stops on the highway...
any good restaurant with good service would serve me a proper three course meal for less than what  I spent in this \"cafe\"!"}
{"text":"A dainty cafe replicating the idea of a French cafe. It is located in the heart of downtown Toronto by King st. 

When I first walked in I noticed there were doors at the back corner that led to another larger restaurant that is connected to the cafe. If you are seeking more than just a coffee and pastry, you're more than welcome to head through the doors and grab lunch. 

Aside from that, I was really impressed with the decor and friendly staff. I ordered a matcha latte, which was a little pricey, but still quite delicious. I was impressed on the service and suggestions made upon my order to best fit my preferred taste. 

It is a great place for meetings, grabbing a quick bite, or studying. They also have free WiFi!"}
{"text":"Think European cafe.  Fine tea and coffees. Breakfast pastries.  Afternoon baguettes, croissants and salads. Beautiful decor.  Reasonable prices. Small Americano $2.70 and tea $2.85. 
Support local with a European feel. 
Service was friendly and location is close to Hockey Hall of Fame. So those not fans can relax and wait for those who are."}
{"text":"Movenpick Café is a cute little European style café with a very nice and bright interior, perfect place to grab a quick lunch or coffee to catch up with a friend.

I got the tuna focaccia sandwich (~$8) and had it warmed up, it was delish! The bread was very fresh and crispy when toasted.

Movenpick Café offers a wide variety of pastries, fresh sandwiches, cupcakes, coffee, etc. The ladies are very friendly.

My only issue was that we sat by the wall and there were a few flies that kept hovering us; as well as a few fruit flies in the food (as they have it all on display openly)... this may have been due to the open doors."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! the place is clean the food is fresh mad before your eyes , the selection is fantastic it's got a nice European flare. My 9 y/o loved to walk around with his tray and pick exactly what he wanted and made how he want it. to me this place is a must , Gret experience as always. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Lovely cozy place to enjoy a warm drink with a friend. Around 8-10 tables in here (2 seaters each). A wide variety of food to eat as well, all looks pretty tasty and fresh. I got the mocha - tastes great. My partner got an Americano - great as well."}
{"text":"I honestly wish I could've said that I liked this place, because the interior design is super cute, but I don't. 
To start off, service was great. The cashier was very friendly and helpful. My two friends and I all ordered iced teas (there were three options, so we got one of each). 
I got the Berry Buddy and honestly, it was awful. Maybe it was because I was expecting it to be sweeter, but it was in fact, quite sour and watery tasting. Almost like if you dissolved Nerds candy in water. 
My friend got the mango black tea, which was slightly better but also tasted very watered down. My other friend got just an iced black tea and hers was the only one that tasted anything like tea. 

I'd like to come back here and try a different item, just because I was so disappointed in what honestly seems like a great place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good coffee/tea....food? Was kind of questionable. 

(Actually, atmosphere-wise, one thing that struck me as strange was that they were playing top 40 hits from the radio in the cafe, instead of something more calm or instrumental. However, it's not that loud and easy to miss.)

I asked the girl behind the counter whether the food was all fresh before ordering, and she said it was. However, as another reviewer has said here, the quiche I had was very rubbery and the crust was tough. It had to be heated for a while on the panini press (as they don't have a microwave -my tea got cold fast as well, and I couldn't ask them to warm it up for me as they didn't have a means to doing so-) and while I was waiting, another customer asked for her quiche to be warmed up some more, as it was not warm enough for her. If these were fresh, why would they be this cold? It was clear they had been stored in a fridge or something similar and were not fresh. 

The girls were helpful, but seemed somewhat overwhelmed with how to manage the place professionally. The tea and coffee were okay too, nothing amazing but definitely picturesque! The main reason I would go here would be to impress someone and take a couple photos. 

Food was a little pricey for what you got, tea was okay at about $2.89 or so, but I ended up spending over $10 for just a small slice of quiche and a tea! Not worth it when you consider my stomach started to hurt just an hour or so later...probably from that definitely-not-fresh-quiche. Definitely go here for the vibe, and maybe just stick to the drinks and a croissant."}
{"text":"I can't say I liked this place too much, maybe it was just the meals I ordered but it was mediocre at best for how busy it was and the ratings it has. Their food menu was really scarce of information and the cashier was super impatient; the minute I walked in and before I even got a chance to take a look at the menu she shot me a glare and asked rudely what I wanted. Lady, calm yourself. Anyway, because I was so rushed by her, I ordered a chicken wrap and a slice of the chocolate brownie mousse cake. Both were were mediocre at best. My wrap came with olives which was an awful surprise that no one asked for. The sauce in the wrap tasted like the Peking duck sauce you eat your wraps with. Overall, not really good. I wouldn't recommend it unless you like salty sauce and olives. 

The cake was really creamy but that's expected of mousse, but the brownie was really good. I opted by scraping off the mousse in favour of the brownie. Both of these two came to a total of $16, plus a really gross $6 \"freshly squeezed\" orange juice that tasted super super pulp-y and super bland. There was no actual taste of the orange at all. So it was like drinking water with random pulp. 

The cafe was really small in size so I can see it getting really busy and crowded. Seats are really close to each other and tables even closer. It's just not a comfortable feeling. Overall, I wouldn't come back just because there are so many alternatives in the are at a much cheaper price and better quality."}
{"text":"Quaint European-style cafe with a great selection of teas, coffees, espressos, pastries, salads, and baguette sandwiches! There's also free wifi. Great spot to catch up with friends over a dessert and coffee :)"}
