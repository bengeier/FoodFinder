{"text":"I'm not really clear on what's going on with L'Entrepôt. The food is pretty good - and plentiful! But the drinks menu is something out of a terrible college bar. The mixed drinks are bad. Really bad. Like, *really bad*. And weak. Should I find myself back in Montreal, I would definitely stop by L'Entrepôt again - it's cute, and fun, and poppin', but I'd definitely stick to shots or beer if I was drinking alongside my massive $5 sandwich."}
{"text":"Went there around 3:30 pm a friday.  Food was ok.  Nice place overall.  We received our drinks and  but had to wait over an hour for a poutine and a burger. While waiting,  we saw people leaving, Thank God i wasn't that hungry..."}
{"text":"Great place! Good food with all dishes at $4,95. Had the beet salad (3/5), the poutine (4/5), the 'constructeur' burger (3,5/5) and onion rings (4/5). I like the fact that all dishes are the same price,  food quality is great ! Will definitely be back but this place is so popular, plan to wait AT LEAST 30/45mn before getting a table"}
{"text":"Simply trying to get a seat was impossible. The hostess didn't even look our way and sat other people that arrived after us first."}
{"text":"How come  the meals are so cheap?? I enjoyed eveything i tasted there. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Rapport qualité/prix intéressant, base de tout: 4,95$ et service agréable. L'attente un peu longue, un bon 30 mn avant que le plat arrive. Musique d'ambiance bruyante, un peu stressante."}
{"text":"The food is not the best but they were full and we did not wait much ar all.   So the food could be better BUT they have cold beer, cheap food and super nice servers and clients. Very nice place.   Beautiful!"}
{"text":"Très bon \"greasy spoon\" situé en plein Coeur du Plateau. Tenu par des Grecs qui font une cuisine dites canadienne c'est à dire un peu de tout mais assez bonne et à des prix abordable."}
{"text":"If you don't have high expectations, this place is pretty decent. I live near by and have been quite a few times, so I feel like I can give informed feedback about L'entrepot.  Food: Large portions, fast food restaurant quality (processed), large menu, many vegetarian options  Ambiance: Often crowded, cramped, line-ups during peak times, loud, cozy decor, unpretentious  Service: Not great  Beverages: Stick with beer or shots...   This is a good place to go have a beer and eat. Not the place to stay all night to talk or to get drunk."}
{"text":"BLAST FROM THE P@ST!! it's been a long time since I've seen a place like this in mtl.  Great atmosphere,  staff is great,  and prices are very reasonable for the quality!!  I'll be back next week :)"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food (at a price of only $4.95 a plate and a little extra if you want add ons) and delicious drinks! I ordered a raspberry mojito that was refreshing and light, and my boyfriend ordered a Jack and Coke, which he claims was the best he's ever had. Considering the price per meal, the portions were well sized. The only downfall of this place is that it was very crowded, even for a Tuesday night. But I definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting the area!!!"}
{"text":"De loin un de mes \"fast food\" préféré. La nourriture est vraiment vraiment bonne.   Les rondelles d'oignon sont à se rouler parterre avec le miel dessus. (Juste à y penser je salive) Aussi, tout le menu est à 4,95$ (bon, évidement c'est rare que je prends juste une chose à 4,95$, mais bon)   Les portions sont généreuses même si c'est moins cher. Il y a des options végétariennes qui sont très bonnes ( pâtes, salades de quinoa, tacos, végé burger) le menu est varié. J'adore particulièrement la poutine de l'entrepôt, sinon, la salade césar avec chou frisé est vraiment bonne. Les pennes aux tomates séchées et sauce rosée sont vraiment bons.   Points négatifs :  -L'attente est vraiment très longue minimum 1h à chaque fois (le soir)  -La musique est très forte (le soir)"}
{"text":"We got there last Saturday at 5pm but it needed to lineup. We are interested in their 5 dollars each dish and it proves to be awesome. The service is also good and we spent a lovely evening. Recommend the mini donuts and honey garlic chicken wings. Good place, I'll go there twice."}
{"text":"I have wanted to go to that place since forever because of the good reviews my friends have said, but to be honest, it was quite disappointing. First of all, we went for lunch and was guided to the table away from the windows and the room was pitch black at 11AM, I understand it is a bar but get some lighting at least for lunch time? Food was quick to arrive and the waitress was nice enough. We have ordered their noodle salad, potato skins and penne pasta for two people, and frankly, even though the proportions were impressive, all the dishes weren't properly seasoned. The potato skins was blunt, even with bacon and cheese and sour cream on top, it still manage to be very blunt. Their noodle salad was so salty and tasted maybe with a hint of soya sauce? The greens in the salad had no seasoning what so ever (maybe it was meant to be eaten with the noodles but believe me, I tried, and ended up with just a bad taste of leaf and salt). Coming from an Asian background myself, some sesame oil and black vinegar would have helped that dish a lot. The sauce of the penne pasta was so heavy, way too much oil and creme. Their peach ice tea was so watered down when it came and tasted not much more than water.  Overall: was it cheap? Yes Were the portion big? Yes Did it taste good? Not really"}
{"text":"Tres bon rapport qualité/prix á 4.95$ le plat ! Quelque soit le plat. Rien d'extraordinaire, mais pour le prix le plus bas en ville, la qualité etait tout a fait correcte! Lors de notre visite le service a ete tres long a cause de probleme logistique de leur part. Ils se sont spontanément excusé en nous offrant les desserts! ---- ma nouvelle destination référence pour lunch entre amis"}
{"text":"La nourriture était bonne , elle valait vraiment la peine pour seulement 5$. Par contre , les ailes de poulets étaient trop cuites , JE ne LE recommande pas. LE point très très très très négatif est JE me sens arnaquer. LE serveur m'avait demandé si JE voulait de la mayonnaise  maison avec les frites , j'ai accepté et Quand j'ai regardé ma facture , il ma charge 1$ POUR la mayonnaise . Ce prix n'était pas mentionné par SA bouche ni sur SA facture. Il n'a pas le droit de me LE charger ."}
{"text":"Jadore ce resto formule economique plat a 5$ pour une explosion des papilles gustatives! J'ai ete plusieurs reprise et jamais decue! Si cetais pas du line up je donnerai un 5  Il serait interessant davoir une autre succursale vue le succes de l'entreprise dans L'est de montreal ca serai pas pire ;)"}
{"text":"$5 Bites. Need I Say More?  Whether you're looking for somewhere to 5a7 with your coworkers, a cheap fun meal with the family, or place to swig and gnosh while you catch up with friends, consider checking out L'Entrepot.  All items on the vast menu are $5, and fare spans the gamut of burgers, tacos, poutines, and just about anything else to quell your munchies. Drinks are also reasonably priced, and the service is friendly and decent.  If you're going to check it out, though, I'd suggest doing with a group of friends so you can all sample as much as possible. I've only done about a third of the menu, but I haven't yet found anything on it that I didn't like."}
{"text":"Bon concept. On peut y manger pour la modique somme de 5$ ! J'ai testé le burger \"constructeur\" avec frites c'était copieux, délicieux et la qualité est là. Une amie végétarienne m'accompagnait et il y a pas mal de plats pour les végés donc ça aussi c'est un bon point."}
{"text":"nous avons attendu 1h20 pour une place sur la terrasse un mardi soir à 18h30.   par contre, pour le prix des plats , ça en valait la peine. comme mentionné précédemment par un autre utilisateur, pour les burgers sont très bons et nous remplissent , puisqu'ils sont quand même assez gros et bien garnis.   notre serveuse était bien gentille , nous pressait aucunement malgré la file du restaurant"}
{"text":"J'ai une drôle de \" relation \" avec cet endroit. Il est très populaire pour une raison évidente (tous les plats sur le menu sont à 5$ !), mais chaque fois que j'y vais, c'est vide au moment où j'arrive et plein au moment où je quitte - ça se remplit en 15 minutes après mon arrivée. Je dois avoir un sens du timing exceptionnel, pour ce restaurant-là, en tout cas.   Revenons à l'essentiel : est-ce que c'est juste peu dispendieux ou est-ce que c'est bon également ? La réponse est la suivante : c'est bon, mais ce n'est pas de la fine cuisine. Ceci dit, c'est meilleur que n'importe quel fast-food tout en étant moins cher et en proposant une ambiance plus chaleureuse (décor en bois, belle terrasse). Et les boissons alcoolisées sont intéressantes et originales, alors ça vaut au moins un petit détour de temps en temps - mais vaut mieux arriver au bon moment, sinon préparez-vous à faire la file."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, really did, but it just wasn't that good. My significant other got a margarita which tasted like pure mixer and there was no salt on the rim, only a tiny amount falling off the side of the glass. I got an old fashioned and it was clear they didn't muddle it correctly or at all. Crispy chicken wings were not crispy and were room temperature by the time they made it to the table. Fish tacos were ok but nothing to make me come back. The concept of $5 food with drink purchase is good IF and only IF the drinks are good which they weren't."}
{"text":"Le concept original du menu à 4,95$ et le petit frère du Bureau de Poste de Québec. Non seulement ce n'est pas cher, mais la nourriture est délicieuse. L'ambiance est incroyable, c'est comme être invité à une soirée bien arrosée où l'ont se sent à l'aise dès notre arriver!!"}
{"text":"Good burger for the price but the potato with skin were not tasty, though the portion size was generous. This is the restaurant selling point; all dishes are priced at 4,95 making this place very popular with young people. Drinks are offered at different price, but the cocktail I ordered had practically no alcohol; your luck may vary depending on the barman. Music selection was great during my visit, but make sure you arrive early as the restaurant will get crowded and loud on evenings. They have several tables outside if you enjoy the sun or Avenue Mont-Royal wildlife. Certainly a great place if you need to invite friends and want to save money on food, perhaps less on drinks; or you are feeling festive."}
{"text":"Si je vous dit plat à 5$ , est-ce que ça vous enchante ? moi oui. En tant qu'étudiante éternelle (et amatrice de bonne bouffe), tous les plans en mode budget m'intéressent.  Ici, le problème majeur est le line-up. Si vous avez déjà lu de mes reviews, vous saurez que je déteste ceux-ci. Jamais de la vie je n'attend en ligne pour aller m'alimenter. Par contre, quand la vie t'y oblige (groupe d'amies), tu y vas. J'ai été agréablement surprise par la qualité et la variété de la nourriture servie, ainsi que de la grosseur des plats. Le plat de nouilles asiatiques était just assez assaisonné et sucré. Le burger était correct, mais tsé pour 5$... Tout est une question de ratio qualité-prix !  Les drinks sont vraiment bons. En tant que fille à cocktail, je peux vous dire que le sour Key fait vraiment la job, surtout lors d'une chaude soirée d'été. Le nom du cocktail fait référence au bonbon sur en forme de clé qui décore le verre. Gin, peach schnapps et bonbons surs. Oui !   En gros, quand il fait beau, c'est line up garanti dès 18h. Prévoyez !"}
{"text":"Really cool idea. Everything on the menu (excluding drinks) is $4.95. We came on New Year's Day and it was packed since it seemed to be one of the few places open. The host did a good job seating our group of 8 as quickly as he could. The theme was cool inside - had a skater vibe going on. They were playing throwback rap jams on the television which is always entertaining. Understandably, the food took a while to come out and the portion sizes are what you expect for the price. The only thing that took away from my experience was that our waitress was rude to my group. I understand that the place was busy, but as somebody who has worked at a restaurant, you should always treat the customer with respect. They certainly don't deserve the attitude. My friend ordered a Negroni, but she brought over a Corona. It was an honest mistake, as the restaurant was loud when ordering, but when he told the waitress that he had ordered a Negroni, she said \"No, that's not what you said - you said Corona\" in a very rude manner. I heard my friend say Negroni as well, but regardless, who is she to say what my friend said? I would recommend the owner to have a small meeting with the staff, as it seems other reviewers have occasionally received rude comments. Other than that, I would recommend the place for somebody looking for a cool vibe, a cheap eat, and a drink."}
{"text":"I am dedicated toward working my way through their whole menu, at this point. It's not just that it's five dollars a plate, which is wonderful; it's that it's five dollars a delicious, filling plate. My partner and I have walked away wholly satisfied for lunch twice now, sharing three dishes between us.  Will update if I stumble across a dish that is less than scrumptious, though I have my doubts this will happen."}
{"text":"Best cheap eats place in the whole town. We ordered two burgers: one with french fries, and one with Caesar salad, onion rings and bbq wings and 2 repeated pints of beer. Price is the same for all food dishes - 5,95$. Atmosphere is great, music choice is very nice, I recommend it to everyone who is searching for good place for evening hangout."}
{"text":"Un burger et des frites pour 4,95$ ? Des quesadillas pour 4,95$ ? Ah oui, je comprends mieux pourquoi il y a de la queue tous les soirs devant l'Entrepôt !   C'est un peu long pour y rentrer en fin de semaine et le week-end, mais vous pouvez venir le tester en semaine sans devoir attendre trop longtemps. Car oui, il faut venir le tester au moins une fois pour se rendre compte des portions proposées :D  Oui, La nourriture servie est bonne, et oui, les portions sont plus que correctes !  Ajoutez à cela de bons cocktails et un bon choix de bières, et vous obtenez un super spot pour inviter vos amis en fin de mois, quand vous attendez encore votre paie mais que vous avec désespérément envie d'une bière avec quelques onion rings...  Attention, si vous venez à 5, 6 ou plus, cela prendra plus de temps pour trouver une table. Logique !"}
{"text":"I'd choose Cinko over this similar resto any day. Maybe I'm biased because I ate at Cinko first and fell in love but although the price point is the same ($5 for everything on the menu) the experience is a lot different.  Upon approaching the restaurant we already saw a lineup that didn't seem to be moving. It took us about 30 or more minutes to finally nab a seat. Once inside the service was incredibly slow but drinks came faster than our food. They had music videos playing loud for music and it was definitely a younger crowd. We both ordered quesadillas and the food was satisfactory. But we can't complain because of the price point.   That being said I'd recommend Cinko on St Denis for a better experience."}
{"text":"Want a cheesy hangout with super cheesy nostalgic 90's and 00's music with cheap eats ( 5 $ anything !) and very very weak cocktails ? ( lesson : order only beer ) . dug the music vibe here because there was no pretense about who they were , quesadillas, tacos and Mac & cheese were popular and for good reason . They were pretty delicious. Most people came to have a few beers and eat up to head elsewhere. We stayed a bit longer to watch videos of said cheesy songs on tvs all over the bar :) it was fun , would do it again! There is plenty to bar hop in the location so try this one out. Service is very very slow and there was a line to get in on a Monday night."}
{"text":"The drinks are really expensive. The waiters were all french-speaking and im not. One of the bartenders made an announcement (i guesss he made a joke) in french and then everybody started laughing (everybody in the restaurant) except me and my friend because we didn't understand a word of it. I had never felt so left out and foreign in my life."}
{"text":"C'est une place parfaite pour manger un lunch à 5$, évidemment il ne faut pas s'attendre au repas le plus surprenant de notre vie, mais pour 5$ c'est très bien . Honnêtement, le service n'était pas très bon... nous avons mangé au bar et le serveur était plus occupé à faire son show que de nous servir. Bon on a peut-être juste pas été chanceux aussi et je me dis que pour 5$ je peux pas vraiment chialer !  Attention : Il ya toujours une file d'attente"}
{"text":"This deserves 5 stars for what it is. I'm all for accessible food and this place delivers! With 2 entrees and 2 drinks per person (and a shared dessert), this meal came out to $25 a head.   The quality of our meals was well above average and they were very decently sized. We certainly didn't leave hungry... or thirsty, the drinks were also very very generous! This place has something for everyone, including vegans and the health-concious.  The interior was dark and crowded. You should be ready to wait in line on the weekend for dinner. The music was pretty loud but either we adjusted or they lowered it after a while. There's a fun modern jukebox to play around with so at least you can choose what super loud music you want to hear.   The service was also very good and checked on us consistently. Overall, I definitely recommend this place for a casual night out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!!! The employees are so much fun and the food is all under $5!! The line is out the door for tables, but we were seated right away at the bar. I highly recommend this place to anyone that wants a cool place to hang out and enjoy cheap alcohol and awesome food."}
{"text":"Très bon! pour un menu à 4.95$. Oui, tout le menu est à 4.95$ :) Peu avoir un service  lent avec un achalandage grandissant.  Léon"}
{"text":"Mettons que t'as envie d'aller au restaurant, mais que t'as pas tant le budget pour te le permettre.. l'Entrepôt c'est la place pour toi. Tous les plats sont 5$ et leurs drinks sont pas bin bin plus chers, le meilleur truc c'est lorsque tu partages des plats avec tes amis. Ainsi, ça fait plus de variété, tu vas être plein et tu resteras dans ton budget ;)   Oh et gros plus : le service est rapide et efficace!"}
{"text":"This was my favourite of my entire experience at Montreal. The menu is great and the prices are perfect. I love everything that I had the chance to try there. The atmosphere is fun, there was great music and nice servers. I definitely want to go back!"}
{"text":"Location: Mont-Royal corner Boyer. Street parking available but metered. Most residential streets are zoned so keep your eyeballs peeled for any restrictions. The closest subway is probably Mont-Royal (orange) and it'll be a 10-minute walk from there.  The place: I think I've had L'Entrepot bookmarked for like, a year - so it was about time I got my arse over there. I really like the feel of the place - it's very pub-like and dimly lit, super casual, no-frills and no superficial bullsh*t. Also, not a hipster in sight. SUCCESS! They've got booths and tables as well as bar seating (I might be making that last part up though).   The goods: One might feel a little suspicious about the quality of the food served here, since all dishes are $5. Yep, you read that right - FIVE DOLLARS. But have no fear - despite the cheap eats, the food is amazing! I ordered the turkey sandwich on cranberry bread, sans fromage, with bacon (extra) and fries. Loved it. The portion was quite substantial, the bread was fresh and the peppered fries were crispy and tasty. The bacon was lacking flavour but I can live with that. My friend had the tacos and loved them. Good food all around.  Service: Quick and friendly!  Price point: Like I said, $5 for everything except drinks, and the assorted extras. Check it!"}
{"text":"Encore un de ces restos dont les plats sont à 5$!  J'aime le concept, les plats sont bons, le choix est varié, ça vaut la peine d'essayer plusieurs fois! Les boissons ne sont pas trop chères non plus; d'ailleurs, il y a toujours du monde et surtout des jeunes. Le décor et l'ambiance sont chaleureux, tout en bois; l'hiver, on s'y sent vraiment bien :) Bien situé sur Mont Royal, pas mal pour sortir après"}
{"text":"Only go there if your budget is very very low. Waitresses are always really nice but come see you once every 40 minutes -- so does our meal... One time tho, when asking for an update on our meal, my waitress gave me a bitchy look and told me we only ordered 15 minutes ago (which isn't true at all) and gave me the worst service afterwards. I'm not the type of person to complain and I've been there a lot and I'm used to noisy place, but this place is next level noisy. Have to yell to talk to someone just in front of me, can't even hear myself think. Worst ambiance to eat... No water refill most of the time, people jumping on tables and bar... Singing (yelling!) in our ears... I get that this must be an exciting place to work but please be respectful of other people around, you're still in a restaurant and serving people to eat not in a trashy club/karaoke... Like I said, don't go there except if your wallet REALLY can't afford somewhere cheaper... Food is okay for the price, not amazing but again okay for small wallets. Be ready to wait a lot!"}
{"text":"Was really impressed by this restaurant. I didn't have high hopes for a restaurant where everything on the menu is $5. They gotta cut costs somewhere, right? Apparently not here. I'd have to say, if they did, it's in their mixed drinks. My friend and I both got mixed drinks, she got a blue caracao drink, and I got a sangria. Neither of us could taste any alcohol in our drinks. So it was basically $7 fruit juice, I'd suggest getting something bottled if you opt to grab a drink with dinner. I got the Chiang noodles entree. A little spicy for my preference, but I have a low tolerance. It was delicious though. One of my friends got a grilled cheese, which much to her dismay did not have melted cheese. Maybe that's only in America? Not sure, but the bread was delicious, the cold cheese was just off-putting. My other friend got the braised beef spaghetti, which was, again, delicious. Overall this place has great food and I would highly recommend if you're looking for good food, especially good and cheap food. Skip the mixed drinks though and opt for a bottled beverage, I like the hard ciders since I'm not a beer fan."}
{"text":"Whoa whoa...$5 food? Must be cheap and not so good....NOPE wrong! I was invited by a friend while I was in the neighborhood to try this place and well, it was pretty good! I had the tacos and had some of my friend's mac and cheese with beef. Both were really tasty. I also had a beer to go with it. The place was seriously packed, for a Wednesday night. Must be a good sign. I really recommend coming here for cheap decent food and some drinks if you're in the plateau area."}
{"text":"4 étoiles pour ce restaurant avec un EXCELLENT rapport qualité/prix !  Comptez 5$ l'entrée, le plat ou le dessert ! La quantité et la qualité sont bien présents malgré le bas prix. J'y suis allée deux fois lors de mon séjour et j'ai pris une salade (très bonne malgré le fait qu'elle contenait de la sauce soja salée et que je n'aime pas ça (ça m'apprendra à ne pas lire en entier les descriptions des plats ^^)) et un burger (très bourratif pour 5$ !). Le service est rapide et souriant, que demander de plus ?"}
{"text":"How can you not love this place?? Each item is $4.95 and the portions are surprisingly generous for that price.   I have been twice at off times without having to wait in line, but this is definitely a popular place with lines fairly often. I have tried the queso, tacos, beet and goat cheese salad, calamari, and the braised beef sandwich. All were decent relative to the price but nothing too special. The calamari were overly breaded/fried and the tacos were fairly plan. I really liked the queso trempette though!  They kind of get you with the price of the drinks (have to make money somewhere). But I thoroughly enjoyed my margarita!  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Came with with a friend for the sidewalk sale. Saw a big lineup here but was well worth the wait! Food was good and the ambience was lively with loud music!!  Will definitely come back one day to try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Great eating option for those on a budget. I have been here several times and I'm pleasantly surprised with the size of the dish every time. It's not gourmet food - but for 5$ you should not expect it to be! Drinks are priced like every other bar around. During lunch (weekend) and dinner there is always a line. They have a take our option - but it costs more (?!), and the one time we tried it - it took more than half an hour to get the food - and we could have gotten a table by then anyway.  The Quebec version - Le bureau de post - has the exact same menu - with different design but similar ambiance.  I can recommend everything that I have tried so far (except the poutine - it's not very good, but there is plenty of selection otherwise). Good for both vegetarians and carnivores."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I had the noodle bowl because I was craving avocado, and it was wonderful. I shared the vegetarian tacos with a friend - very good as well. Also got one of the best old-fashioned's I've had in the city (an unexpected delight)!! We went early (around 17h00) on a weeknight  so there wasn't much of a line-up. And, of course, you can't beat the pricing."}
{"text":"I went to this place a Tuesday - lunch time.   First of all, the place wasn't packed at all, but oh my was the service SLOW. We waited 40 minutes for a salad and pasta... Our waitress never showed up to ask us how the food was and i had to grab a bus boy to ask him for some water while waiting for our drinks...   Now i wouldn't have mind if the food was good. I know its 5$, so already, i wasn't expecting much. but wow was it disappointing. I got the beet salad and the rose pasta, the salad was INCREDIBLY salty, it wasnt edible.   I thought maybe it was just me, but the girls sitting next to our table got the same salad and she had the same reaction, wasnt able to eat her salad. So hey, i guess it wasnt me.   Normally, i wouldve asked for something else, but i did not feel like waiting another 40 minutes, and more importantly, go on a search for our waiter. I asked someone, not our waiter, for our receipt, and he told us he was going to grab our waiter to ask her to come see us...um waited another 15 minutes with no receipt. When i finally flagged the same person, clearly showing that im unhappy and still waiting, he brought us the receipt himself.   Overall, just go to Cinko, food is much better, so is the service."}
{"text":"First off this is a skaters dream, with skaters on every tv doing tricks and a bunch of broken and not broken skateboards all around as decor, and lots of wood and banquettes and booths, very nice place.   By now you get that this place is probably not for a bunch of hipster duffus, no pretentiousness to be found anywhere here. Just straight up cheap as dirt food that \"hit's the spot\". The staff is young \"Le Plateau\" french people, not be confused with nearby Mile-End consisting of a lot of hipster duffus...not that there's anything wrong with that!   I came here on a wednesday afternoon (today)which was very busy. But nothing like they seem to be on late nights. Some people seem to complain that the food isn't all that great but let's put this into perspective: everything on the menu is $5 !! ****except the alcohol which is at club prices ( they have to make money somehow !?)  You can even buy a drink for the hard working cooks! It's written on the menu! Which should be done right after you get your meal, so not to mess with his original buzz and mess your food.  $5 menu? Nothing else to say. $5! That's it. Try it. It definitely won't break the bank. I tried a burger constructeur and changed my frie for a  poutine and for desert I tried the creme brule from their monthly specials, which totalled $13,60. That's how much McDonald's crap costs... The decision is not hard. Everything is $5. Everything must go!  In my mouth!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place after seeing the line-up at L'avenue. Decent menu - everything is price at 4.95$ which is amazing! Ordered a vegetarian sandwich with the soup and a side of fries (which I thought would be a a little extra - but it was treated as a separate dish - should've checked). Food was good, service can be a bit slow but all in all, I liked the place and wouldn't ming going there again."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée un jeudi soir à 9pm, la terrasse était pleine (30 minutes d'attente). 15 minutes d'attente pour l'intérieur.   Nous nous sommes assises au bar. Bartenders très gentil! J'ai adoré! 4,95$ pour une tapas ( choix de 30 tapas!!!!). Portion généreuse!! Nous avons mangé des rondelles d'oignons (excellentes)! Plus d'une vingtaine de choix de shooters! Excellent! Plus d'une vingtaine de choix de drinks. Miam miam!   Allez y!  Clientèle 20 à 32 ans, selon mon observation."}
{"text":"Everything about my visit here for dinner and drinks was absolutely amazing! I want to give 6 stars if possible.  First off, $5.95 everything, all day, everyday?!!? Is this even real life???  Food: 5 VALUE and DELICIOUS! I got a burger, pork chops, and Mac n cheese which were all super fresh, good size portion, and yummy in my tummy. Even when it was busy, it came out after a short wait. (Also, if you like sweet drinks, the Pornstar tastes like a jolly rancher)  Service: 5 Server was quick and bilingual, no need for us to speak French! When we also ordered drinks, the bartender came by very quickly with the drinks at our table.  Atmosphere: 5 Dim, high Boise level, good music, not too much seating so you can expect a wait if you come here at peak times. Good space between the tables so you don't have to yell too much   10/10 will want to be back if I find myself in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Des planches de snow accrochées au mur, des tv qui passes des spots de skate, et la musique qui va bien en fond sonore. Dès l'entrée, on s'y sent bien !  Coté menu, c'est pas cher, et ça cale ! On a pris les rouleaux de porc et le burger, ça nous a tenu jusqu'au soir ! Tout ça accompagné d'une bière... et y'en a même des peu communes ! :D  Bref, parfait pour une fringale pas chère"}
{"text":"Voilà un concept que j'aime! Tout les plats à 4,95$, c'est bon, c'est plutôt copieux (on a du mal a y croire tant c'est pas cher) l'ambiance est bonne, la déco aussi, bref j'adore! Un rapport qualité prix imbattable! Le point négatif est qu'il est victime de son succès et la file peut être longue parfois, surtout l'été. Compte tenu de l'achalandage le service est un peu expéditif  et je me sens mal a l'aise d'y rester une fois mon repas terminé."}
{"text":"This place.is like el furniture in vancouver bc.   A no frills diner with comfort food all for the affordable price of $4.95...  Ordered the smoky burger paired with soup . Wife had the fish tacos and had poutine with maple bacon for appys.   Burger was great. Not dry. Moist and juicy and portion was awesome. Cheese was perfectly melted. Only thing negative was the bun. In vancouver, they use brioche bun.which was lightly oiled and toasted. Here, it was more like $ store bun. Very dry and stale. I ended up not eating the bread. But the patty was seasoned well and everything else came together.   The soup tho tasted weird...it was like a mix.of grits.and cream soup.and garnished with chinese green onions!! So weird!  Maybe the chef was trying a fusion.of some.sort...but let me tell you...it did not work.   Fish tacos were awesome. Fish was perfectly breaded and tasty and came with a wedge of lime. The salsa and veggies accompanying the taco filling all complemented the dish.   The poutine was awesome. Fries nice and crispy...curds were aplenty and creamy...maple bacon was generously sprinkled on top. The sweetness of the maple and saltiness of the bacon...complemented the gravy curds and fries magically. Definitely a must have.   Service was great. Iit was quick and spot on  For price and value ration: a must try for sure.   A nice and affordable place.given the chic neighborhood of mont royal.  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice this week and the food is delicious!!!! The first night I had to wait outside in line for 30 minutes just to get a seat for 1 at the bar. I ordered potato skins and beef tacos. The potato skins could've used more cheese (especially since they overlap them in an X shape) and I didn't like the salsa on the tacos but I still stuffed my face lol My next visit was during the afternoon and I tried the Sun Dried tomato penne pasta with marinated chicken and it was to die for!!! Definitely the best pasta I've had in awhile!! I also ordered a drink, \"Bulldog\" and it was obvious the bartender didn't know how to make it. He flipped through some printed out pages by the register before just looking right at the menu and using that to guide him. The end result tasted like a corona dunked in water and definitely wasn't worth the 12$. I look forward to trying something else her, but I'll avoid the mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Super ambiance dans le bar avec des musiques old school, on a adoré. Cependant le bar n'est pas l'idéal quand vous voulez sortir en amoureux ou entre amis juste pour parler tranquillement. La musique est beaucoup trop forte. Repas à 5$ c'est plutôt pas mal rapport qualité/prix"}
{"text":"$5 food menu is great value for quality food!  Drinks menu is decent, with 6 beers on tap."}
{"text":"Most of the dishes has a good portion for only 5$! I didn't try everything yet, but until now, what I took was good.   The service can sometime be long, but it's fine. You often see a line-up at the entrance.  Cheap meal? Go there!"}
{"text":"Tu en as pour ton argent. Tout est à 4,95$ en tout temps. Bien sur, il y'a quelques extras que tu peux ajouter, mais tout se mange bien sans.  Je conseille vraiment d'essayer les burgers, vous en aurez vraiment pour votre argent. Par contre, avec les tacos et le grilled cheese, tu comprends un peu mieux où ils peuvent faire leur argent.  Finalement tu peux facilement manger avec juste un burger et être rempli. Avec un aide de frites et tu es en business."}
{"text":"3.5 Star quality food, but the prices are insane. Really cheap for the portions! The staff is down to earth and funny.  The place smells kind of weird but it's a good boozy brunch for the price for sure. I got the burritos (which were okay) and the poached eggs (which were really good). Also their chorizo (stole some food from a friend) was also fairly good."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favourite restaurants. Discovered it a few weeks ago through my girlfriend, she told me everything on the menu is $5 and everyone she went with really enjoyed the food (especially the donuts - I was told they were fighting over the last one! Haha)   I'm vegetarian, so when I took a look at the menu I was pleased to see that there were tons of options for me to choose from. From quesadillas, to tacos, to pasta, to nachos - even a veggie burger! That was the holy grail for me. I was incredibly curious since I've never had a veggie burger not made by myself from anywhere but Harvey's and decided to try it out.   Let me tell you... It was BOMB. Harvey's can't even begin to compare. This is the best veggie burger I've had in my life. The brioche bun is toasted perfectly, has an incredible texture, the corn salsa is such a unique touch that adds a kick, the avocado makes everything so smooth, the cheddar adds excellent flavour, doesn't taste fake or processed (I have an intolerance to dairy so I've had the burger without the cheese and it was still amazing), the macho sauce is the perfect condiment, and overall its just... Well, everything you'd want in a burger. It feels so right. Not to mention, the side salad has such a great dressing. Yam fries are on f*cking point, as well as the donuts. I've never found a place with such satisfying texture for all of their items. Add the price into the mix and L'entrepôt beats just about any place I can think of. Worth the waiting time (which has never been too long for me) and DEFINITELY beyond worth the price.   The flavours work so well together. Everything is seasoned wonderfully. You can tell they care about the quality of their food. The chefs know what they're doing! Well done to everyone working in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were hungry and walking home, when we came across this place on the way.  We were skeptical to try it when we saw that everything on the menu was for $5, thinking it may just taste like regular bar food and we would be disappointed.  We decided to order three things from the menu but were pleasantly surprised at the huge portions and the great taste.  We have had their tacos, burgers and pasta so far and everything has been consistently good.  Turns out this place has the best comfort food and quickest service in the area."}
{"text":"Every meal is $5 only, so everyone buys two! They are good sized meals to where one would be enough bit two makes sure and why not for the price. The sweet potato fries are amazing and the burgers are good! The drinks are $5-$9 ea , guess thats where they make their money. Good fun atmosphere and the waiters are good. Slow to make the food but cant complain for the price. Definitely a place to try out."}
{"text":"I don't like much about this place except its prices. For $4.95, you can get yourself a plate of a typical bar food: greasy and filling.   The quality is slightly below ordinary, the music is way too loud (you cannot hear the people across from you at the table), the line is usually an hour long and the service in the restaurant takes for ever as well. The is also an odd smell of sweat in the restaurant if you go at night.  Definitely avoid on Friday and Saturday nights, you will never get a table!"}
{"text":"5 stars. Great (I mean great) food,very high quality & very affordable. Everything on the menu is 4,95. Additional for add ons.  The portions are not skimpy either-we had left overs.   I split the French dip sandwich, the penne roasted tomato pasta and the poutine. I would live this night all over again."}
{"text":"Super concept!  Pâtes très bonnes. Portion généreuse.  Burger OK.  Cuisine quand même recherchée pour des plats à 5$. Goûteux et efficace.  Service courtois et amical."}
{"text":"Tout à 4,95$ sur le menu! On aime!   Pas mal de choix! J'y suis allée plusieurs fois et je n'ai jamais été déçue des plats commandés! De plus, il y a quelques options pour les végétariens (le burger \"le végétarien\" est délicieux) mais c'est plus difficiles pour les vegans par contre...  Les sandwichs sont d'une bonne taille et servis avec frites, soupe ou salade, comparativement à d'autres \"restos à 5$\" où on ne vous sert que le burger.   Plusieurs possibilité d'ajouts pour vos plats (viande dans la salade, pain grillé aux herbes fraîches pour les pates, etc) pour quelques sous de plus.   Je n'ai personnellement pas encore essayé leur menu de cocktails, mais j'en ai entendu de bons commentaires de la part d'amis.   Le gros point négatif est le service pas toujours au top. Par exemple, la première fois que j'y suis allée nous avons attendu plus de 10 minutes après avoir demandé à 2 serveuses pour un remplissage de nos verres d'eau... Et suite à la lecture des avis sur Yelp, je vois que je ne suis pas la seule à penser que c'est à travailler!   File d'attende peut devenir assez longue en heure de pointe, ils sont victimes de leur succès! Mais chose certaine, ça vaut le coup si vous cherchez à bien manger pour pas cher!   * À essayer: la \"trempette de l'entrepôt\", se partage super bien en entrée!   * Notez qu'il faut commander de la nourriture pour consommer de l'alcool  * Pour les intéressés, les menus (nourriture et boissons) sont disponibles sur leur site web si je ne me trompe pas..."}
{"text":"5 dollars, c'est cool. L'Entrepôt est un endroit cool."}
{"text":"Pretty good place when you're on a budget since everything is 5$. For the price, I have to admit that the food is more than fine. It's a good place to hang out with friends after work, grab a drink and a plate, if you don't mind sticky tables. There's usually a pretty good line up to get in so you gotta be patient."}
{"text":"Nourriture excellente et abondante. Ambiance chaleureuse et agréable. Vaut le détour."}
{"text":"We stopped in here with a group of 7 people and were able to sit at the open big round table at the front immediately. It took a while for our server to come to our table but once she did she was very kind, spoke English,  and somewhat attentive. If you order an alcoholic beverage you have to order food as well from the menu due to their liquor license which we were unaware of, we originally wanted just drinks. We ordered off the only menu they had which is $6.95 for each item on it. We got the chicken tacos which I enjoyed, the pierogis which were ok wouldn't order them again, chicken fingers were ok, grilled cheese and tomato soup was good, also the Asian noodle salads were very good! Attached picture of our pierogis. We enjoyed the music very much, played today's hip hop hits which right now are drake and other artists. Unfortunately the outside patio was closed because it rained that morning but it looks like a nice spot to sit at as well, inside is much darker. Overall ok food, good to pop into for a quick bite and drink if you want both. 4 stars for pub food, not anything gourmet."}
{"text":"As tourists, we tried this spot out for dinner.  The menu is pretty dang awesome, lots of salads, burgers, appetizers, nachos.  But cheap bar food is apparently cheap bar food universally it seems.   We were not expecting fine quality food here but our food came out cold, soggy, and took an exceptionally long time to be served.  The service was terrible.  After quite a long wait, I asked the waitress what happened to our food service as we saw others who arrived after us with their food.     Has potential to be a decent cheap spot for some drinks and bar food but I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Alors oui, bon rapport quantité-prix. J'ai mis un bout avant d'y aller car faire la ligne pour manger ça me tente rarement. Finalement, un dimanche soir à 18h pour deux personnes, on a presque pas attendu. Les pintes de bières pressions sont entre 5 et 6$, rien d'extra de ce côté, du classique. J'étais étonnée de voir que les plats sont des portions normales pour le prix de 5$. C'est sûr que ça vaut le coup et il y a du choix de plats.  Musique beaucoup trop forte cependant."}
{"text":"Host kept seating people before us, had us wait 45min at front of line to get in. Group of 3. Waited way too long. They seated 6 and a ton of 2s/4s before us.   People dancing on countertops too. A little too unpro as a vibe. Food was good. $4.95 + add ons, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Vraiment pas cher ! Et les portions sont hyper grandes, je ne m'y attendais pas. J'ai essayé les quesadillas au boeuf braisé, un vrai délice. J'ai également commandé le mac n' cheese, qui s'est révélé être un plat géant, crémeux et quelque peu piquant.  Finalement, pour dessert, les mini donuts accompagnés de dulche de leche, ( je crois que c'était ça), étaient bien chauds et moelleux. Le service est super agréable. Préparez-vous à faire une file par contre et la musique est un peu trop forte.   Vraiment une place à essayer pour petit budget ou une rencontre entre amis rapide.  PS: Ils n'acceptent pas les cartes débit."}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing meal of our trip. Our B&B guy was so excited about it though so we decided to give it a try. Big mistake. We had to wait awhile to sit outside, but it was so nice out we didn't mind. Once I went inside I was really glad we waited. The prices are super cheap. I think that's the only good thing about it. The service was horrific. It was slow, but then it became obvious that the waitress just forgot our food. We complaigned that tables that came after us got their food first. The waitress didn't seem concerned at all and never apologized. When we got the food it was obvious it had been sitting under lights for awhile. It was okay, but nothing great. I'd skip unless you are trying to save money."}
{"text":"Zero complaints! Good, cheap, fast food. Bartender was great and even turned on the hockey game we wanted to watch!"}
{"text":"Food is quite tasty. Hamburgers are okay. Good portions. Good service sometimes. Drinks are great! But its easy to get carried away  since the food is 4.95$ ...the drinks are regular price between 7 and 14$ so if you are having more than one drink your bill can surprise you.  Upside down corona in pink lemonade is my fav drink so far...looking forward to trying more.  I ordered chicken nachos and soft tacos for my friend. The tacos looked more like a wrap but she found it quite tasty still.  Nachos are good too!"}
{"text":"D'abord, je crois simplement que je ne suis pas une fan du concept de payer 5$ pour l'ensemble des plats. Je trouve que souvent, ça diminue la qualité des plats. Toutefois, nous y avons bien mangé. Il n'y a que les ailes de poulet qui manquaient légèrement de goût, mais ce n'est pas la fin du monde! Je vous conseille les pitas aux poissons; très bien!   Un grand choix de drinks est proposé, le mien était trop sucré à mon goût! De plus, il faut s'attendre à payer plus cher votre boisson étant donné le coût des plats; mais ce n'est pas si pire.   Nous avons mangé au bar; je vous le déconseille. Les barmen manquent de professionnalismes et n'arrêtent pas de crier à tue-tête."}
{"text":"Perfect place to pre drink and grab a bite before going clubbing on Mont Royal avenue.The music is pumping and the crowd can get pretty rowdy, just the right atmosphere to start a night out. Definitely not a spot to take your date or to catch up with a friend - at least not at night!   The food is very good, I was pleasantly surprised as every dish is $5. Yes, you read it right $5 only, AND they don't skimp on the quantity and quality. I took the spaghetti with tomato sauce with braised beef and parmesan. It was scrumptious, I would definitely order it again. I recommend the cheese and spinach dip as well but it's quite rich, it's best to share with someone.  My friend ordered the pierogies and I was jealous. They are tender pieces of fluffy goodness - the perfect comfort food!  I was surprised with their cocktails. Not only are they cheap too at $6.50 but they're very tasty and original.Their sour key drink was a hit for all my friends and I. Do not order if you're not into sugary cocktails though!  Overall, I definitely plan on coming back and not just once!"}
{"text":"At the time of this review, everything on the menu is $4.95.   Many choices from salads, to sandwiches, to wings, nachos, pasta, burgers, etc.  I got a salad and a sandwich.  Both were good, but not excellent...  Hey!  It's $4.95.   Can not expect top notch gourmet quality stuff.  It's a pub / bar atmosphere with a nice outdoor seating area in the warm months.  Overall a nice cheap eats in the Plateau."}
{"text":"I expected more to be totally honest with you. I felt as though the plates were missing something. It seemed a bit bland. The chicken wings were burnt to a crisp, the tacos were nothing special, they seemed to have forgotten the turkey in my turkey sandwich.... But on a positive note, the poutine looked good??  I would absolutely love to give this place another try. I get the fact that it's only 5$ a plate however I did expect a bit more. Maybe they were just having a bad day?"}
{"text":"I visited L'Entrepôt for the second time, last night after a Yelp event, accompanied by a few Yelp friends.  I like L'Entrepôt for a few reasons, everything is $4.95, there are a bunch of vegetarian options, and the place is open until 3 AM.  The first time I went, I only had dessert - a fried apple pie with vanilla ice cream - that was delicious!  I was excited to come back and try a whole meal.  We arrived around 10 PM Wednesday night, and the place was packed, there was a bit of a lineup but we were able to wait inside.  We were a party of four, but we didn't have to wait very long to be seated, and we were quickly and attentively served by the staff.  We started with a shared order of pierogies, a plate of 8.  I liked the presentation, but we found them a little doughy.  I initially ordered a Mac and Cheese, as did one of my companions, but due to some honest confusion only one was brought.  Luckily I was able to try some of it nevertheless.  I found it to be a little uninspiring, I was hoping for more flavour in the sauce.  The dish was a little spicy, and the kick was welcome, but not enough to really impress me.  This gave me the opportunity to order a different dish - the vegetarian quesadillas.  I found these to be much more enjoyable.  There was a good variety of vegetables, even green beans to my surprise, giving a nice flavour palette to the dish.  Coupled with tasty sour cream and a piquant salsa, it was a success!  My companions ordered salads, a poutine, and a burger.  I can't speak for those items, so you'll have to wait for their reviews :).  For dessert I had the fried apple pie with ice cream, it was pretty good but not quite as awesome as I remembered.  The ice cream, however, definitely lived up to my high expectations.   In terms of the ambiance, I found it to be loud and dark, like many late-night bars.  It's not my preference, and sitting right beneath a loudspeaker didn't help either when trying to have a conversation, but this is the nature of the beast, and I've had worse.  I only mention this so you know what to expect, not a real negative.  We all enjoyed the majority of the playlist that consisted mainly of 90's and 00's rap, with a smattering of pop from other eras.  You can never go wrong with James Brown's \"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\" ;P.  I had a lot of fun singing along with half-remembered Eminem and House of Pain lyrics, and I wasn't the only one :P.  Cash, credit, and debit are all welcome here.  All in all, I think it was a pretty good experience, and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Oh hot damnn this place was so impressive for me. I came with a group of yelpers after a wine tasting event. We were hungry and looking for a bargain ahaha. Don't let the cheap playes fool you they are full and. Served with a huge amount of quality and flavour. I had the malibu bleu cocktail which I recommend 100%. We had their perogies whoch were very doughy unfortunately and not much potato filling. I also ordered the SALADE DE NOUILLES ASIATIQUE wooooow it was huge for just 5$ damnnn how impressive. My friend also had their mac & cheese that I tried and was so succulently delicious. The service was very quick and satisfying. The atmosphere was great a lot of throwback 80's& 90's music hehe amazing just a little too loud as it turns out into a bar/ club at night. We couldnt hear each other talk very well and have to say it was noisy. It's not the best place to take you date to but if you plan to chill and enjoy yourself with a group of friends on a night out it's definitely a great choice.  Overall, it was super amazing good music, laughs and giggles. Definitely recommend this place for awesome quality bargain food !! A+"}
{"text":"Concept très intéressant avec des plats à petits prix mais qui en valent le double. N'attendez pas à la cuisine raffinée mais les plats copieux et un grand choix font l'affaire. L'ambiance est cool aussi, un seul bémol c'est le temps d'attente pour être assis. En général, une expérience positive et j'y retournerai avec des amis pour un repas décontracté et convivial."}
{"text":"C'est un très bon rapport qualité, quantité et prix. Le seul problème est l'attente pour avoir une table (j'y suis allé deux fois et j'ai respectivement attendu 45 minutes et 35 minutes)."}
{"text":"J'ai été très impressionnée par la qualité de la nourriture et chaque plat coûtant seulement 5$. Les portions sont généreuses et tout est savoureux. Le seul bè mol le service à la clientèle froid, la serveuse aucunement agréable et personne ne venant nous voir spontanément pour demander si tout va bien ou si c'est bon..."}
{"text":"$4.95 for anything on the menu is the best deal this city has to offer. Period.   At that price, I wouldn't have even cared if the portions were small and the food were shitty. In fact, I was expecting it. But I can admit when I'm wrong, and boy was I ever! The servings were huge for the price, and the food was super tasty. We biggest mistake was underestimating this spot and ordering five plates of food (nachos, perogies, mac and cheese, pulled pork sandwich, quesadilla - all delicious)... my belly was figuratively bursting by the end of the meal. They also have an incredible selection of drinks, and pints are super cheap.   My biggest regret of the whole evening is that I'm going to want to eat here now every night."}
{"text":"Probably in my top 5 choices of bars/restaurants to go to on a \"chill\" night. Everybody is friendly, you'll meet people at the bar guaranteed. The food is great and for $5 it can't get any better than this. Cocktails are ok, definitely recommend basic mixed drinks or beer instead.  The only thing is that there's always a lineup and food will take a while to come out. As long as you're not in a rush, you'll love it !!"}
{"text":"We came in because it was meal time and many restaurants in the area had long lines. The beef spaghetti was a bit too dry and salty. The fish tacos were mediocre. Both only cost CA$4.95, so the price/quality ratio wasn't low."}
{"text":"I had to lower my expectations A LOT to be able to enjoy my meal. After I did, it ended up being pretty good. You can't expect first class food for 4.95$. However, compared to the sister restaurant on Crescent, the service and atmosphere was much better. It is a good place for a quick bite with a friend or group. The service was relatively quick and our waitress was pleasant. I shared the quesadilla and Caesar salad wrap with my friend. The quesadilla was pretty soggy and was falling apart while the wrap was pretty yummy. The fries were tasteless and had clearly been frozen. It's more of a bar with music and music videos playing on the many flat screen TVs. It was packed on a Wednesday night and we waited in line for 10 minutes at 11:00pm. We didn't order drinks so I can't comment on that but they looked good. Not the best food in the world but can't beat the price. Food: 2/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Price 5/5"}
{"text":"This place always has a lineup when I walk by so i wanted to check it out and see what all the hype was about. I loved it!! I went on a monday and sat at the bar with a friend. The crowd is young and a bit loud so if it's not your scene don't go! It makes sense that the crowd is mostly under 30 since the food is only $5. These guys next to us were doing shot after shot! So fun! The food was pretty damn good too! I had poutine with bacon . No complaints here. Bacon was good. My friend had the chicken ranch wrap. I was really impressed with his plate. It was delicious! It came with a side of salad or fries and he chose the salad.   For drinks I had a double Bloody Caesar of course. It was pretty decent. The drinks are normal bar prices though. I then proceeded to have two gin and tonics and it was regular. I would go back to this place if i was in the area and if the lineup wasn't too long! Food was good and so cheap! The bartenders were really funny and nice too. One was teaching me how to whistle with a straw."}
{"text":"This place has become my favorite restaurant in Montreal. Not only for the price but the quality of the food is astounding and is better than other places that would charge 2 or 3 times more."}
{"text":"Si vous venez ici, c'est clairement pour le prix, à 4.95$ le plat, on fait une bonne affaire. Pour ma part, je peux dire que c'est un bon rapport qualité/prix, même mieux que L'Gros Luxe ou Cinko. Mon burger ''Constructeur'' était délicieux/juteux ainsi que les frites croustillantes, même chose pour ma salade de quinoa, proposition généreuse, avec avocat/salade et mes tacos souples étaient bons. Comme drink, je me suis pris une Labatt 50 en pinte, 5.75$ comme plusieurs autres clients de place. Par un lundi pluvieux, la place était pleine et y'avait une file d'attente à l'extérieur. Victime de son succès faut croire. Ils ont une petite terrasse extérieure sur Mont-Royal. Clientèle, 20-30 ans, style skaters,..Service correct pour le prix qu'on paye. Je pense que je reviendrais si je veux manger pas cher.  4/5 visité en juillet 2014."}
{"text":"If you're on a budget and looking for place with affordable menu options and cool atmosphere, this place is on my \"cheap and cool\" places to eat and drink.  It can be a very busy place though, so I would recommend to get there as early as possible (after work) or to try to book beforehand (although I'm not sure if they accept bookings for large groups)."}
{"text":"Went there a few times, and enjoyed every single times. The first time I went, I didn't expect much from a $5 menu, and was surprised in a really good way. I tried the mac&cheese, a few burgers, and the donuts. All of them were quite good.  Drinks are also quite abordable (beers starting at $5, cockails at around $6 if I remember well). This place is always busy by the way, except during lunch. So I recommend you to go there during lunch. If you still want to got at night, expect to wait around 30 minutes or more (waited around 40 minutes last time I went there, worth it though)."}
{"text":"Avec le principe de tous ses plats à 5,95$, on aurait pu penser que l'entrepôt nous sévirait des assiettes cheap et trop peu garnies.   Eh bien c est tout le contraire dans cette ambiance de chalet, après-ski, nos assiettes sont généreusement remplies et surtout délicieuses.  Petite ou grosse faim, on trouve son bonheur et à bas prix! #givemeadviceimbroke  Des entrées à partager au colossale burger le constructeur, on se régale et ça c est peu dire !"}
{"text":"C'est un très bon resto bar. La nourriture est très bonne, pas cher. Presque tout les plats sont 5$. En valeur de qualité prix, tu ne peux pas voir meilleur. L'ambiance est excellente, les serveur et serveuses sont très sympathiques, ils méritent un peu plus que 15% de tip. Je suis allé très souvent et sa ne me déçoit pas. Le seul problème qu'il peux avoir c'est l'attente pour la nourriture. Mais s'ils considèrent que le service était long, ils te donnent une assiette de beignets qui sont très bon."}
{"text":"Exceptionally bad service, but good food and drinks. We know it's busy and all, but the waitress took extremely long between everything: giving us our menus, taking our order, giving us our drinks, receiving our food (which they got wrong), getting the bill, coming to make us pay... They really are understaffed and don't seem to give much costumer satisfaction. The fact that the food is cheap shouldn't go hand in hand with bad service. Just don't come if you are hungry! The food is decent though, and the drinks and music were good. Props to the bartenders, they were working extremely hard!"}
{"text":"One the best deals in Montreal. Excellent food for a low price.   The sweet potato fries are the best I've ever tried. Don't forget to ask for the mayo. Delicious.   They do have a couple of vegetarian options and BELIEVE ME... it worth trying.   The service is very friendly and the ambience is the best to come with friends.   It Music is very loud, But you'll see that it's part of the whole ambience. Also... It can have a line outside on weekends. So be sure you get early."}
{"text":"All the food is 5$! How can you beat that?! The quality and flavour surpassed my expectations, and the drinks were well priced as well. The air conditioning wasn't working well, so on a hot summers day make sure to sit outside! I will definitely be going back again...stand out dish was the beet and goat cheese salad, and the sweet potato fries were some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"how can you not like this place? everything is $5!!!  i visited L'Entrepôt toward the end of my trip when i had been over eating for daaaayys on all the yummy food Montreal had to offer.  So during my lunch here, I only ordered a simple caesar salad.  I was still digging it!  portion was generous.  we also got the queso corn chorizo dip~ again, great portion size! we almost had trouble finishing everything~   would definitely recommend if you're in the area and need a simple lunch... ooor a feast! it works for many occasions.  it can get busy so be prepare for a mini wait."}
{"text":"We had the maple glazed onion rings (super yummy), beet and goat cheese salad (surprisingly flavourful), and the \"constructeur\" burger (meat was over-processed, but otherwise good). The standout here was the service. Our waitress was attentive, polite, and very quick.   And if you don't know - everything on the menu is $4.95. Everything. It's a super sweet deal, and the place has a lot of charm. We'll definitely be back.  Edit- you've just lost a star: Came back with a friend for drinks... Definitely not as good as last time. Minimal glaze on the onion rings, the potato skins had sparse toppings, and the hard shell of the tacos were STALE. We let our server know... and she did not offer to get us something else and we were still charged for bad food. Not impressed. Worth a third try? We'll see. I was not super happy that they didn't get our wine order right either."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré mon expérience ! Une multitude de choix pour la modique somme de 4,95$.  Une ambiance enveloppante et de la bonne musique ! À essayer ;)"}
{"text":"We got there around midnight and the place was so packed we (3 people) squeezed in a table for two. The music was loud af you have to yell on top of your lungs to get your conversation - any sound waves - across the table. Thankfully though, you can, in turn, select what goes into the speakers from the jukebox where you could play some Canadian classic such as 'Boyfriend' by Justin Bieber.   As for food, even at 4.95$ a dish (dirt cheap), I still feel like I've been underwhelmed on most parts other than the salt profile: everything (including the sauce and soup) was saturated with NaCl (or sodium chloride for non-chemists; table salt for scientifically-illiterates). I felt like I was walking Bob, my chihuahua, down in New Orleans during hurricane season, where Bob and I involuntarily swallow a couple liters of sea water each  -- except at L'entrepot, t'was a torrent of iodized table salt and no water (very busy night, despite the numbers of waiters).  Well that's that on the saltiness, other than that...  5$ maple glazed onion rings sounded like a nice deal until you realize it's just a fancy name with no maple taste or maple what-so-ever. In fact, it's regular onion rings with a thin coating of burnt sugar.  The burgers, namely the 'constructeur', the 'BBQ fumé', and the 'Swiss aux champignons' had cheap patties that 'felt like Harvey's'. In terms of dressing, I'd take a bacon McDouble over the 'constructeur' any day of the week (excluding weekends cuz I might be drunk enough to not mind).    With this kind of a review, why I am still giving out 3 stars? Because the place was full while the streets were empty and people seemed upbeat despite the plated salt and music (Boyfriend) by a Canadian literary genius. It's hard to argue with success."}
{"text":"I have been to this place, twice, and both experiences were polar opposites.  The first time was supper time, there was a line out the door, and a group blatantly cut, walked up to the front and got served immediately. We then got stuck with a small table in a bad spot, and when we asked to be moved they told us they just gave the last big table away... To the couple that cut in front. Not a good start, but not necessarily the restaurants fault. We ordered pierogis, Mac and cheese and quesedillas. We had to wait 50 minutes to receive anything, with the waiter only addressing us twice to apologise but provide no solution or explanation. Onto the food: The pierogis weren't very memorable, but they were quite small for the price which I will address later. The mac and cheese was decent, but the quesedillas were burnt. We gave ourselves two hours to get food before going to show and still arrived late which is pretty crazy.  Now the second time we went was around noon, much less busy. We got seated immediately and ordered nachos, a burger, the Entrepôt dip, the fish tacos, mac and cheese and the veggie burger. This time the food took about 10 minutes to arrive and was excellent. The complete opposite of our first experience. The nachos were decent, I found the burger very good and it came with a side salad which is great for the price, the fish tacos were pretty good but I found a bit lacking of toppings. The entrepôt dip was amazing, I didn't expect to get my money worth but they provide a huge portion. I didn't try the veggie burger myself, but heard good things. Overall a great experience and definitely want to return at lunchtime. Plus, the whole meal came to about 40$ for three people and we were very satisfied.  As a note on their pricing scheme, it is a double edged sword. For $6 a burger or the tacos is a great deal, on the other hand 6$ for some onion rings or a slice of pie is not. I find this to be a positive since I don't normally order sides when eating out, but you can take it or leave it.  To summarize my experience with the menu:  Burger: 8/10 Mac and cheese: 6/10 Fish tacos: 7/10 Nachos: 7/10 Dip: 8/10 Pierogis: 4/10 Quesedillas: 4/10"}
{"text":"This place is waaayyy too overrated. I think it should only be given 3 starts. Bad service even though staff is friendly. Average food that fails to surprise the senses.Prices are decent but nothing about this place surprised me except how cute the servers are. That's about it"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever.   Din't wait outside but waited over an hour to even get a server to acknowledge us.. We left. An hour to even get a glass of water. Pathetic."}
{"text":"I had two epiphanies while here. First is, ever since I used VR I haven't exactly shaken the feeling that I'm in VR.   When I was 19 I had a life changing experience. I was watching Eckhart Tolle and long story short I was sent into an all consuming and entirely convincing experience that I was one with everything. That I was God, and everyone around me was too. It was an altered state of consciousness. I didn't need to eat or sleep much. Everything around me was intimately beautiful and I was it. After four days of this state, I switched from my Journalism program to psychology, and pursued a new life in Montreal, feeling reinvigorated and reborn.   But part of that experience is a disillusionment. You recognize that you've been living in a simulation. It's an experience of waking up. So since I \"came down\" as long as I'm not in that state of consciousness I have this latent sense of fakeness in regards to everything. Makes me feel psychotic sometimes.   Anyways.  VR is like simulation inception for me and can be shocking. I've been doing more psychedelics and I can get into this crazy space of unreality and it's been pretty scary.  So I really untangled that. Thank y'all so much  L'entrep?t.   My second epiphany was that I NEVER understood what people meant when they referred to drinking after a hangover as \"hair of the dog.\" I simply never completed that idiom... hair of the dog that bit you! Wow. Always complete the idiom.   Food was great but the waitress was better! She was so real! Just not playing into the whole \"waitress\" thing. I liked it.  My friend (the painter one) also has some opinions:  \" I like it. Last time I was here i sat inside it was too loud, now that I'm outside on the patio noise isn't a problem. I think I am allergic to gluten \""}
