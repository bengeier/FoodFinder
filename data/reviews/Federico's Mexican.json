{"text":"So the food is yummy and pretty fresh tasting most of the time. The service, however, leaves much to be desired. They've already gotten my order wrong three separate times. Never once did i get an apology. The workers barely speak or look at you. You can tell it's full of young people who just don't want to be there. So it's  a toss up. The food is good but the service makes the overall experience mediocre."}
{"text":"They took 25 mins to bring out our food when going through the drive thru. As if we ordered the whole menu. needs better service ."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times and I would say there is only a 30% chance they will actually get your order right. I always get carne asada fries and ask for no guacamole, only one time did I not get guacamole like I asked!!! This time I was fed up and decided to call asking what I can do for the situation. She said I could come back, and it's currently 1am, so I didn't want to go back out. Or I could save it in the fridge and bring it back the next day for a refund. 
It really is not difficult when there's not customers as it's 1am get an order right..."}
{"text":"Food is decent for Fast Mexican Food, but it's way too hot inside the restaurant to enjoy unless you like to sweat when you eat!"}
{"text":"Great food and Taco Tuesday is the bomb. $1.50 Full Size Tacos; shredded beaf, ground beaf or red chicken. Ive had the burritos and they are big and very good. Nice people. We will be coming back."}
