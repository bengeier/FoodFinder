{"text":"Vegans rejoice!  We just had a spectacular vegan lunch.  The variety was unbelievable!  We enjoyed the taco salad, BBQ wrap, Reuben, and meatball sub.  Everything was delicious!  The highlight of the meal was the starter, the African peanut soup!  Make sure you get a bowl!  Don't forget the pie, both the chocolate cream and coconut cream outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is a fine little place. The food is pretty good and flavorful for being a vegan caf√©. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to try something different. I most recently had a vegan hot sausage sandwich. It was very tasty. You couldn't even tell that it wasn't made of meat. The only thing I will say is that I wish the portions here were a bit bigger."}
{"text":"Excellent & creative food every time we've gone that always leaves me feeling good and invigorated rather than bogged down. Atmosphere and music is great too! Totally fair prices, one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I am not vegan or vegetarian.  I regularly eat here for lunch, mostly take-out.  I really enjoy the meals here.  The soups are all generally very tasty.  The African Peanut Stew is hearty and delicious.  I also really like the Hot and Sour soup whenever they have it.  My favorite lunch entrees are the Hummus Wrap, Taco Wrap, and Veggie Burger (on a bun).  The Garlicky Greens are a great side.  Salads are always a good option too.  

My only caution is that it can get a touch pricey (or can leave you still hungry) depending on how much you order relative to other \"normal\" lunch options.  I have no problem paying a small premium for fresh ingredients and preparation which is what I assume most people expect when heading to Randita's."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!! Delicious food worth crossing the bridge to get! Excellent service and amazing food"}
{"text":"I just realized that I have reviewed the Saxonburg location but not the Aspinwall restaurant. I have eaten here several times since it opened up, and have always enjoyed the food. It is open for dinner only on Friday and Saturday (lunch Monday through Saturday). The menu only has three entrees and they generally vary from week to week. You can find them on the Randita's website (you have to work just a little to find the dinner menu). Three items may not sound like much, but in my experience they have been tasty about ninety percent of the time. You might expect a restaurant to have more than three entrees, but apart from Chinese, Thai or the handful of vegetarian restaurants in the area, how many other restaurants have even two vegetarian entrees, or vary those entrees from week to week. 

I have gotten takeout from here on many recent occasions, in addition to dining in those few times. And I really like the peanut stew, I get it every time I go."}
{"text":"I ADORE this restaurant and it's owner. brought my vegan sister here from out of town, and as we ate, the owner played several instruments for us. It was unbelievable! My sister lives in Northern California, so vegan restaurants are no big deal to her--but delicious food while the owner plays live music?! Randita's puts progressive Pittsburgh on the map."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with live music. I love the African Peanut Soup, considered their trademark.
However, I had the Swedish meatball dish tonight, and I was dissappointed it really had no taste, has potential but needs more flavor and spice"}
{"text":"I was just at Randita's today for the first time, I'm glad I decided to go. I was on my way home, wanted something to eat, and thought I'd see if this restaurant was open yet. It opened about a week or so ago.
First impression, I really like the decor, They use this reddish burgundy color on the walls that give it a very homey, yet classy look to the place, I felt very comfortable there, and I was eating alone. 
The service was good and the lady working there was very polite and informative, 
I think the way they serve water is so cool. They give you your glass and a very cool looking bottle full of water. I want to buy one of those bottles, hehe
The food was very good. I had the Hummus Wrap, and the Veggie Wrap, Ya, I was hungry )  They were nice enough to put the sauces on the side, which, I think I'd do each time I go there. 
As someone else stated, some evenings the owner will play guitar, and I hear he is very good. I would love to be there when he plays, With good food, awesome surroundings, and good music, how can you go wrong, 
I live n Aspinwall, and I'm really happy these people picked out little community to place their restaurant, (Thumbs up for that )  Thanks,"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their food truck at Mother Earth news sustainability festival."}
{"text":"Once again, a hit!!!!  Great Orange Chicken Seitan, Lasagna, Thai Curry, and that famous African Peanut Stew as well as wonderful desserts.  Add to it all a performance from guitar/vocal master Dale Cinski and we had a terrific Valentines Day dinner with great friends.  You owe it to yourself to give Chef Randy's dishes a try....you will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Randitas holds a special place in our hearts. It was the place of my husbands and I's first date late in 2014. Last month, Randy graciously agreed to cater our wedding (with only a months notice) and went above and beyond to make it the perfect evening for us and our guests. Vegans and non-vegans alike will enjoy her food and ambience at this awesome and very special restaurant. And her staff is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Our new daughter-in-law is vegan, so we have been searching for a restaurant that will serve her good food, not just fries on the side. Randita's fits this requirement. We ALL enjoyed our food. 

The four stars were for the cost. The portions were on the small side. And while the wait staff was nice, the food took a little longer than a chain restaurant to arrival."}
{"text":"Went last night. On a scale of 1-10, service was an 11. Food isn't cheap but the quality is amazing. Really nice setting. Tried one of each dish since we had a party of 3. Loved each of them. Also tried 2 desserts (coconut cream pie and choc peanut butter pie) and the African peanut soap. So happy to see a completely vegan place in Pittsburgh and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan but the food here is awesomely wonderful. Healthy and good taste go hand here.  The chocolate peanut butter pie complimented the African Peanut Soup and Vegan Hamburger that I had eaten. Good food, good price, wonderful owner and a free coffee through Yelp. I will definitely return for this fare again."}
{"text":"Amazing, delicious vegan food in a chill atmosphere!!  African Peanut soup was decadent, as was the Reuben sandwich and awesome mixed green salad.  Lemon tahini dressing = amazeballs.  Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian (or a vegan for that matter), but my son is. So we ventured to Randita's upon his suggestion. We all (4 of us) ordered different things. I don't recall everything we had. But my husband liked his pumpkin soup. I loved my salad. My son got a bbq dish that he very much liked and our friend got an Asian tofu dish. Everyone loved the food. Again, I'm not a big fan of the substitutes, but all had a glowing endorsement.
They were very busy.
We would go back. I'll try something different."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful visit to Randita's, we experienced wonderful service and delicious food. 

The owners are really nice, they explained how they started as a catering business, then as a restaurant in Saxonburg. The hours are limited right now, but I expect they will expand as they grow their business. 

The menu is limited, however it's more choices than vegan/vegetarian diners get at other restaurants. 

There's live guitar music two nights a week, and it's very good.

One of the best things was the restaurant is BYOB with absolutely no corkage fee."}
{"text":"A carnivore walks into a vegan cafe...

I met a girlfriend for lunch here and walked in with an open mind and empty belly.  I am a carnivore by all definitions but I can appreciate a wide range of cuisine. There isn't a whole lot that I won't eat... if it tastes good, I'll probably like it.  Lucky for me, everything at Randita's tasted GREAT.  I was greeted & shown to my table by the owner, and he was extremely pleasant and attentive during our meal.  

I ordered the taco wrap and was blown away by the flavors they put together using just veggies and tofu! The crumbled tofu was seasoned to perfection and the vegetables were fresh and crisp.  It was quite delicious and I'd definitely order it again.  I actually had a hard time deciding what to order here because everything sounded so good!  I think any diner would find themselves tickled with at least one or two things on this menu, and I imagine the organic, vegan crowd does too.  I'm glad I finally got to check this restaurant out, and look forward to visiting again soon since my office is so close by!"}
{"text":"2nd time here with my husband and 1year old son it's been a great experience both times. We are not vegetarian or vegan and we live to come here it's quite refreshing and relaxing. I highly recommend stopping in for a bite they also have live music on Friday and Saturday nights, come and enjoy"}
{"text":"Was looking for a new all vegan restaurant and came across this gem. It lived up to the hype with great service and a casual atmosphere. Had the veggie burger and \"Cuban\" soup. Would highly recommend the African peanut stew."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a yelp review for this since I went for my birthday last year. Everything about this place is excellent. Chill vibe, amazing food, caring service. There was a guy playing gentle guitar music while I was there and when desert came out he strummed happy birthday - it was a really nice touch. Vegan food in Pittsburgh has improved vastly in the last few years but Randita's is forever one of my go-tos for a lovely vibe with people who really, really know vegan food and are clearly passionate about what they do."}
{"text":"They have a very good idea. Our server was the sweetest women,  she was so very kind. Try the teas, they are delicious. Fresh brewed and their own blend. The hummus plate with very fresh, you could hear the chef chopping the fresh vegetables for the appetizer. I had a rice dish, and my husband had a seitan dish. Both were OK, the sauce on the seitan was a stroganoff, made with a creamy coconut sour cream. Interesting. Very limited menu. Bring your own wine."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch. We were beyond disappointed. The cafe as a whole was nice, but small. The menu didn't have very many options. Don't come here if you're very hungry because the portions will not fill you up. We paid $8 for 4 tiny little \"meatballs\" on a hot dog bun. The sandwich was good, but really??! It came with 3 pieces of spinach, no side, nothing else. They don't even have sides for you to add even if you wanted to. We've been vegan for 7 years and there are better places to eat. Definitely will not come back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, warm ambiance and great service! I love supporting organic plant based cuisine and highly recommend randitas!"}
{"text":"Suuuuuuuuuper friendly.  Really good, and I think, unique, options.  Limited menu is probably the only REAL downside.  BYOB, so plan ahead.  

Nice location next to a juice bar on a sleepy street just off Freeport Road.  African Peanut Stew was delicious, entree was better (but the entrees change on the weekends).  

A liiiiiiittle hippy dippy for my tastes, but if you have an open mind and a sense of humor/adventure...it's adorable.  

Fifth star for a full menu and a bar...I'll keep my eyes open."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant. Although tiny, it was very elegant. The food and service were excellent. We heard the serving sizes were small, but we thought they were perfect.The only reason I didn't give this all five stars was because the salad,  which sounded fabulous, was just ok. Everything else was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Sometimes when you venture out of your neighborhood comfort zone it turns out well, other times it is quite uncomfortable. That is how I felt in this restaurant. 

The idea is great! Vegan and organic, what's not to love about that? The menu looks good and has many options. But there were a few issues that need addressed.

One is the smell. The restaurant has a bad smell. I am not even sure how to describe. Somewhere between toilet water and cheese. Maybe it was the wall to wall wood. Maybe it was something else. The bathroom itself didn't smell strongly, I checked it. However, the smell was there. 

The second is the portions. I ordered a meatball sandwich with a side of seasonal vegetables. The sandwich was a tiny little hamburger bun with little tiny meatballs on it. I was really disappointed, and really hungry! The veggies were good but needed salt or oil or both! I can't believe that tiny sandwich was $10. 

Now the actual taste of everything was good. The meatballs were interesting and the fake cheese was weird but vegan cheese is always weird. Vegan parm must be hard to make accurate and it was pretty darn accurate! Everything seemed homemade which was really cool. On a side note, delicious soup and delicious coffee. Must order!"}
{"text":"This was such a delight. We ordered many dishes and shared them. Each one was delicious. The staff was helpful and friendly. I cannot wait to go back. 
Well, we came back and it was even better this time. We also enjoyed the guitarist and his selection of music."}
{"text":"Randita's is the newest addition to the quaint business district along Commercial Avenue in Aspinwall. They focus on organic and vegan cuisine. Now, I'm not vegan (cheese and I have way too good of a thing going for me to ever give that up!), but I can appreciate healthy, non-GMO food (at least some of the time -- other times I just want my damn french fries, and that's okay too :) Anyway, my husband and I stopped in here for lunch the other day and had a lovely meal.

The space inside is small -- only about 7 tables and a small bar. It is clean, cozy, and charming, with deep red walls and fresh flowers adorning each table. For lunch, my hubby and I decided to split a few things -- African peanut stew, veggie burger, and an order of chips and salsa.

The chips and salsa came out first, and it was delicious. The salsa was clearly homemade and not some crappy from-the-jar stuff. Tons of chunks of tomato, jalapeno, onion, and other spices. Super fresh! As for our meals, we really enjoyed both the stew and the burger. The African peanut stew is a sweet potato-based soup deliciously spiced with pepper, coriander, cayenne, and other warm spices. It had just the perfect amount of kick to balance the sweetness of the sweet potatoes. The whole peanuts garnishing the top added a nice salty, crunchy bite as well. The veggie burger was also delish. It was topped with a gourmet ketchup (no overly sugary Heinz ketchup here!) and coleslaw, and also came with an additional side of slaw. The slaw was really unique....thickly cut, unlike most coleslaws...almost like a dressed cabbage salad. The food here is clearly healthy and prepared fresh and with care, so I felt really good about what I was eating (which can't always be said when you dine out).

The one knock on this place is that the portion sizes are fairly small for the price. However, it IS all organic, non-GMO food, and that comes at a premium. Plus, for lunch, I'm not looking to leave super stuffed and needing someone to wheelbarrow me outta there. So I didn't mind the small portions.

They also do dinner, and our waitress said it's good to make reservations since they're so tiny. It looks like they might also have live music sometimes as well, since we saw guitars and music stands sitting in the corner. Oh, and the sign on the outside says they're also BYOB!

Overall, if you're looking for healthy, vegan, organic food that you can feel good about eating, definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food at Randita's is so wholesome. You can truly eat out and feel healthy after doing so. The owners are BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE - seriously, real examples of how beautifully a person ages when they're healthy. Wow, you guys. 

I started with the african peanut stew and it was marvelous, satiating, and full of flavor yet very healthy. My group split the hummus platter as well, which kept things interesting with three different types of carrots. 

For my entree, I had the tofu with broccoli in a garlic sauce. Usually when I eat out I like to have something a little more fancy or cooked with techniques that I can't necessarily implement on my own at home, so that was the only downside to this entree - it was a little too easy and simple for me to warrant paying for it at a restaurant. I felt that way about a lot of the food, but it was all still so delicious and healthy. 

I felt like I was being served in someone's cozy home. The ambiance was beautiful. Paintings by the male co-owner adorn the walls and they are truly masterpieces.

I love a vegan BYOB restaurant. My group brought two bottles and the vibe was amazing here."}
{"text":"it made me feel like shit!  vegetables are for rabbits not people!  i pooped my brains out after eating this mess!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!  I usually don't eat vegan meals, but would come here in a heartbeat.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Best food. Best service. Prices were reasonable. Owners were the sweetest. This place was great! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ok. Hands down the BEST place for a Vegan bodybuilding couple to have a cheat meal...you can eat all night and still walk away with macros to spare....bored or confused yet? Ok here's the dirt: 

We went for diner around 6pm on a Friday night and didn't know if we should have reserved but...we made it. Cute little location and not too far of a drive. The street the restaurant is on looks very xmas-y cute right now. 

Great atmosphere. Great staff. Live guitar and keyboard tunes. Romantic setting, bar seating, walk in totally available but not because it's dead, just cause we were early. 

I had the lasagne, hubby had the chicken and biscuits...I die. I die. If it wasn't a tad on the pricey side  (but worth it) I'd be there once a week. 

We didn't imbibe as I am in full training mode but the tea was good. We had the chocolate peanut butter pie for dessert - just 1 split, wish we had the macros for 2. 

Bravo little Randitas...I'll have to go back for lunch some time soon....you cannot go wrong here and if you do, maybe it's your fault."}
{"text":"Randita's is excellent.  I have had nothing but excellent food and experiences there.  Recently they had chick'n and dumplings on the menu...it was amazing! So good.  The chili is some of the best I've had and the peanut stew is great too.  I took a group of (non-vegan) co-workers there and they all really liked it.  The wait staff is just lovely too.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was so sad to learn that the first time I came here would probably be my last. They are closing soon to go onto bigger and better things and that to me is a shame. I loved the decor and the atmosphere. The man at the front who identified himself as the owner was so nice. He let us pick our spot and was ready on hand to help with any questions on the menu. 

With the check in for Yelp I was able to score a free glass of tea. I picked the mint and it was a joy to drink after the meal. I am a tea lover and it was steeped to perfection. Yum. Already I felt at home and that I would love it here. 

Appetizer:

For the appetizer I picked to eat one of the soups on the menu. I was really interested in the African Peanut Soup because I made a slight version of this with chicken and wanted to see how theirs stacked up. 

African Peanut Stew: Sweet potatoes slow-simmered with tomatoes, ginger, garlic, coriander and a hint of cayenne. This stew was perfection. I loved how the flavors melded together in my mouth. Not at all to spicy but just enough to enjoy all the tastes that were moving over my taste buds. I would get this again and bump it up from a bowl to a trough please! The presentation was also beautiful. I loved how the dish was served kind of like a little art piece. 

Main Course:

Meatball Sandwich:Seasoned meatballs made with lentils, brown rice and oats topped with marinara, mozzarella and parm. Not a fan of the sandwich. It was served on a hotdog bun and that could not take the weight of the meatballs. The sandwich had a lot less cheese than I would have liked. For a meatball sandwich I need a lot of mozzarella and parm, this had the bare minimum. I also decided to go with the coleslaw which was a really weird combo that didn't go well together at all. I should have known better but I felt rushed in my choice. Like oh gosh, he is here just pick! I am sure he would have let me have some time but when you are on a lunch break time is of the essence. The meatballs were also just a little much for me to handle. They were just a little gooey for my taste. I should have done something more basic. But for my first time I wanted it to be exciting. I was disappointed. It was just meh...

I would love to come here again and get the stew and something different on the menu. I would have loved to get the Reuben but it was crossed off the menu. Online it says Tuesdays only, but  maybe they took it off?

I will say that my co-worker tried the taco salad and loved it. She thought that the tofu was wonderful and seasoned really well. The sauces that came with it were in her words spot on. I really watched her enjoy her meal while I struggled a bit with mine. 

I would say, come here before they are closed! But be mindful of what you are ordering and what those tastes combining will be like on your palate."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food!  BBQ \"chicken\" wrap was in a very flavorful sauce. The meatball sandwich was also very tasty.  I also really recommend the cole slaw. My only complaint is that the portions were a bit small.  I hope I can return here soon!  The decor was nice and so was the service."}
{"text":"The best vegan restaurant I have ever been to!!!
Everything about this place was amazing!! 
The food was soooo good!! I got the Reuben...OMG!!! These people can produce some pretty magical meals with seitan! I had a piece of the peanut butter pie for dessert. I would fight someone for a piece of that pie..seriously I would!
The service was wonderful. Everyone I encountered was friendly and welcoming. The look of the restaurant was very nice. It made me feel at home.
I will definitely be coming back anytime I'm in the Pittsburgh area!! I love this place."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in here briefly last week after lunch to see what it was all about. I knew then I had to return! There is a pay parking lot outside. It is only $.50 hour. Just a heads up- there is a police station right across from it so there's no getting out of it. There is a sign on the outside for BOYB.

I arrived when it opened.  I met the owner and artist Dale Cinski who turned out to be my waiter. Yes, there is a free coffee or hot tea with your check in. They have a list of several loose leaf teas which they put in one of those tea bags. With me fighting a cold I chose one that had a honey base. Please note that they only serve iced tea in the warm weather months. You are given a flask of water with you meal. Ice is available upon request.

I decided to start with the African peanut stew which consists of sweet potatoes, ginger, and coriander.  A cup is $5.00 but that is really all you need. The soup of the day was split pea. I had read that on Tue they have their own version of the Reuben sandwich which is available only on Tuesdays. It is made of shaved corned seitan with sauerkraut, thousand island dressing, house made cheese on rye bread. With it you get a choice of a side dish.

I loved the soup. It had a slight \"kick\" to it  but otherwise was absolutely delicious. It took a while to get my main course but I know good things come to those who wait. The sandwich appeared small when I got it but it was oh so filling. It did not taste like the Reuben's you are familiar with but it was flavorful and I loved every bite of it. For my side I opted for the grilled vegetables. They too were very good!

The place is very small and I learned they have entertainment on Friday and Saturday nights only. Take out is also available. The place is adorned with beautiful artwork done by Dale which of course is for sale. They also have a food truck. Don't look for it now. Wait until spring. You can find where it will be when you check the website.

I love the opportunity to eat vegan because I know it is good for me and helps me get the right nutrition. The staff was very friendly and attentive to my needs.

Randita's is located on Commercial Ave which is parallel to Freeport Road. It is only a short drive to exit 6 of Rt 28 which can take you over to Highland park or back downtown.

This place is a must return. Can't wait to try out their other offerings."}
{"text":"The peanut soup is incredible. This place never disappoints. During this last afternoon visit, the host played live music. Straight out of a Hugo novel. Humus wrap was great too."}
{"text":"Lifelong carnivore here, decided to try this place out for my birthday meal. It blew me away. The place itself is quaint and clean and very cozy. Waitress was super awesome to me as I was asking about every item so I could get a handle of what the whole vegan thing was about. 1st off ordered a small peanut stew. That stuff was the bomb, creamy, a little spicy, savory and tasty . It was amazing! Tried the taco salad which was another huge hit. The lime vinaigrette and the meatless mix and the salsa and veggies were super together. The meatless meatball sandwich was awesome as well, the sauce was thick and sweet and amazing. The BBQ meatless wrap was another awesome thing. The sauce was perfect and the spring mix in it made it tasty. I left shocked, stuffed and ready to go back to try some new things there. It made a believer out of a meat eater. I don't think anyone would be let down in any way if they ate here. SUPERB!"}
