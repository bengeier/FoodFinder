{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon after hearing there was live music from 2-4. Teeny weenie little place jam packed with vintage records, cd's, great entertainment, music enthusiasts of all ages and a decent cup of hot coffee. 

Two live solo performers to grace the window stage of this quaint little establishment. First up was a singer named August Knight there for his solo debut. Wow. Incredible voice and quite impressive. Check him out if you ever get the chance! Second was James Clark. Very entertaining and he even featured a new music video after his set. So fun. 

I would most definately recommend this place for live shows, record collecting or even just to pop in for a great cup of hot coffee and super friendly service. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Tidy little shop on the Lakeshore. The Gentleman that runs it is very helpful, outgoing (even if he didn't know who/what \"Bauhaus\" were). That said, OK selection by and large specializing in British Invasion era and mid 60's (Bob Dylan). The \"Good Stuff\" is always in the new arrivals crate at the front - New Order, Misfits, The Doors, which is hit + miss in terms of pricing (New Order's Substance = $50, Misfits (best of vol 2 compilation) $30 with the note \"Scratch on side 2\")...
Overall, it's a place I'll pop in and browse and now and again find a gem. Worth a look."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for records, CDs, and occasional live music. Friendly staff and high quality products. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Village Vinyl has a great selection of vinyl records, music cd's and musical memorabilia. They have a wonderful cafe that serves quality coffee and delicious treats that I regularly enjoy while browsing their inventory which is expanded on a daily basis. I highly recommend Village Vinyl to any music lover!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here today and love it!  Super friendly proprietors, reasonably priced and well curated selection of records, CDs, books and magazines - it's not a huge selection but all the picks are all clearly thoughtfully chosen.  I will definitely be back again to go in for the concerts, the tea and to take advantage of my new loyalty card."}
