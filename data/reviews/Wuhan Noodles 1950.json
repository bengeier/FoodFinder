{"text":"Food: Pretty good taste, doesn't taste bad for sure. Size is below average, I could take another bowl for sure.

Price: Well, it's alright if you get the $7.99 plain dry noodles. Me and my friends have ordered others which are $9.99 and they've just added literally few small pieces of chicken and charges you two dollars more. However, this place is still fairly cheap. 

Service: This is the part I don't like about this place. After sat down for over 10 minutes and we've ordered our food, we haven't even gotten a cup of water. Meanwhile, the table next to us immediately got napkins and cups of water as soon as they sat down. Now, I don't know if it has anything to do with us speaking Cantonese, but when we try to call them over and ask for water, they are all looking down on the pad behind the counter. Fine, there were 3 guys and they just ignored me. Then we got up and pour the water for ourselves. After we paid up and left the place. One of the waiters came out and said we haven't pay the tips yet. We did pay them tips. Like WTF, we had to ask for water, napkins, and pour the water ourselves when other tables came in and they immediately served them water and gave them napkins. And now one of them came out and said we haven't pay them tips? 

Something to this place: Tips are something that corresponds to the level of work you do for your customers. IT IS NOT MANDATORY. You guys should be glad that there is a tip at all."}

Wuhan is the capital of Hubei province in Central China. They are known for their hot dry noodles where the main seasoning is sesame paste topped with a good helping of chili oil and spring onions.

According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, Wuhan's dry hot noodles are the most popular noodles in China followed by Beijing's fried sauce noodles (aka Zha Jiang Mian) and Shanxi's knife-shaved noodles.

This place opened not too long ago with two locations currently (the other one is at Yonge and Sheppard). I have been meaning to try this place and I finally made the trip over.

We ordered the dry hot noodles with chicken as well as a beef noodle soup.

The egg noodles were nicely done and springy for both dishes. I found the sesame paste pretty thick so it gets quite clingy against your throat as you eat the noodles unlike other types of dry noodle such as dan dan or shanghai-style sesame noodles.

Personally I Iiked the beef noodle soup more. The broth was flavourful and savoury with a decent kick. Would have liked the soup base to be a bit more piping hot. Spiciness can be adjusted to your liking for those who want more of a kick or a milder version."}
{"text":"Decided to try this little restaurant on a Monday night for early dinner. Maybe we were early, but we were the only table while we were there. When we were just finished, a customer entered to order a take out. For a new restaurant, I would be a bit concerned. It seems like they're not promoting themselves very well.

Since it wasn't busy, the server was friendly and took his time explaining the menu. We ordered one dry noodles and one spicy beef noodles. The food came pretty quick but it was awkward. They don't seem to have a kitchen. The food was made right at the bar where the cashier is. Anyways, the dry noodle was pretty good - it wasn't made soggy. The sesame sauce was strong too - not some watered down dressing. As for the rice noodle, I wish it wasn't so chopped/ broken. Also, the pieces of meat were wayyyyy too little. The size and the quantity doesn't exactly match the price of $9.99. 

All in all, I wonder how long they will survive in this plaza. I might come back, I might not. I don't think I would crave for this and it isn't a priority to be back. When I do come back though, I do hope they have improved a bit."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to come here and try this place out, as they have opened a few branches in toronto as well. and boy it is really not good. from the price to the quality of food to portion. they can't seem to get anything right. the service is beyond terrible as well even by chinese restaurant standards. as the server was too busy playing on his cellphone to bother serving customers. we had to flag the guy down multiple times to get menus to get water, to get chopsticks, and to get the bill. Basically you're better off serving yourself. 
             The food is unbelievably bad, i'm not sure if the chefs have ever been to wuhan, but the noodles and dumplings we ordered were just wrong, the dumplings to add insult is frozen packages they bought, they couldn't even bother to make their own. this is just crazy for a noodle dumpling place. 
I would definitely not recommend this to anyone who wants some good food, or good portion or good priced food."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a weekday evening at around dinner time and it was very empty.  There was only one other person eating here. 

They have pictures on the wall showing what China was back in the olden days and it is a nice touch to the decor. 

We ordered the beef rice soup noodles and the dry wuhan noodle special.  When the dry noodles dish arrive you have to mix it yourself, and do be careful when you are mixing because it could get onto your clothes.  

My wife likes the rice soup noodle more and I liked the dry wuhan noodles.  

Overall, my experiences here was good.  The portions were a bit small for me but then I eat a lot."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Wuhan. I would give 4 stars for the hot and dry noodles, but 2-3 stars for other stuff. There several Wuhan style restaurants that I know of in Toronto. This is the only one uses the RIGHT noodles. If anyone wants to try hot and dry noodles out, I'd recommend it. 

The reason I give the noodles 4, it's because it's too salty and sweet. They didn't put garlic water in the noodle neither. Even small amount of garlic water makes huge difference!"}
{"text":"The noodle tastes pretty good. Tofu skin sold out that day, so I didnt get a chance to try it out. Other review mentioned that there was little meat, I confirm that is true."}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing. After hearing about this new type of noodles, I decided to search around Scarborough for it, and stumbled upon Wuhan Noodles 1950. We ordered their classic \"chicken spicy dry noodles\" and boy, all I got from it was a thick sesame/peanut paste. It was so thick and heavy that I was hard to swallow. My friend ordered the Braised Beef Noodles, and that also lacked so much flavour. Next time, I'll head down to Baldwin St. for PanPan Noodles to try."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing the new location at Yonge-Sheppard. I had their chicken dried noodle, first item in their menu. I only got one chicken wing in the bowl, definitely not enough when there's a tall portion of noodles underneath for me to eat still. I don't think it was unreasonable for me to expect a bowl of noodles that costs more  than $11 after tax to have more than one piece of chicken. The one piece of chicken was tasty though. The noodles were a bit too dry and the oiliness sets in towards the end. Although they mix the noodles for you beforehand, there was still more peanut sauce at the bottom than at the top of a tall noodle container that didn't allow much room for me to mix the noodles myself at all. Maybe I came in closer to their closing time and they didn't have enough ingredients left? I would have been open to trying other things on the menu if they had just been honest about it and recommended something else that they think they could have delivered better."}
