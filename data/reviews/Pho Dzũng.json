{"text":"Where's that o in the pho up there? Someone fix that. Anyway, good pho, good service and a pretty big place for a pho joint. Tried the Dac Biet and was good, much better than some other places I've tried in the past. Reasonable prices all across their menu. 

Parking is very limited at the front but ample space in the back side of the restaurant. I don't have much to add at this point as this is just another pho joint. Will be back to try dishes other than pho but that's a promise hard to keep bcs I'm a pho addict."}
{"text":"Tried Bun Bo Hue (hot & spicy soup)today,  the soup is tasty and flavourful.  Very clean & cozy place.  Prices are reasonable .  Recommended."}
{"text":"Very good taste for the Pho. It feels like a small family own restaurant with french/english limited but very sweet and nice staff. The PHO tastes good,taste homemade. Not alot of fat in the broth.
Vermicelli is delicious also.
Restaurant is big and clean.
The place to go for Pho in Laval:)"}
