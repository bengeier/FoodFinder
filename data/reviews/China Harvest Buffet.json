{"text":"First let me say I'm a picky eater love good food a friend took me here so was not my first choice da price was good da food ? Let's just say my first and last time hopefully."}
{"text":"This place when using their coupon is an amazing value."}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever had in my life. Spring rolls were hardly cooked & cold on the middle.Noodles were awful as was the shrimp. Don't waste your money !"}
{"text":"Worst place ever the food was burnt and the rest was luke warm ....they should be ashamed of  themselves  ...letting children  run around the restaurant  with silverware  dropping it and screaming and yelling .... we will never go here again and we're going to tell everybody about this I only wish I could give it negative five stars"}
{"text":"At first, I wasn't that keen on eating here after seeing the exterior of the place and the surroundings. But I ended up eating 3 times in the 3 days that I stayed in this part of Phoenix. Very good food for the price - $6.5 for lunch during the week and $7.5 in weekends + tax.  I am a vegetarian, so I was happy to see a lot of vegetarian dishes. My favorite were: cooked spinach with garlic&co., mung beans sprouts (loved these), rice noodles with vegetables, buttered cabbage, roasted potatoes, cooked mushroom & vegetables, winter soup (green onions). My friend also loved the hot and sour soup.  I absolutely loved the ice cream - I ate 3 soup bowls of it the first time I went.   There is a good selection of fresh stuff: leafy greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, honeydew melon and sweets: canned pineapple, bananas covered in jelly, jello, 2 types of very good cake (1 brownie like and 1 with lemon).  The staff was also nice and they were constantly replenishing the food - so it was always at a good temperature. They were also very attentive to clean the tables when you were done with a plate."}
{"text":"Small selection of food here,but for the price I guess its ok.Its not all Chinese, there was some American food as well. Some of the food seemed old and service was ok. Was driven in by cheap price but your better off paying more for a more quality buffet."}
{"text":"Dont let the price of 5.99 fool you. The food here was horrible it was either way over cooked or not cooked enough. They also dont seem to care about appearence as the seats were torn. Lastly they dont have the A/C very low making the whole experience swampy and hot"}
{"text":"Awful experience. Food is ok. I'd rather have Panda Express over this place any day. Absolutely rude service and they have a 7 year old running the cash register. Too many other options around to settle on this dirty place."}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying the outside doesn't look great but the food is very very good there's lots of seafood some stuff a little old but for the most part I definitely for the price will give it five stars you get to eat lots of fresh shrimp and just general seafood and Asian foodThe service is so-so but they're out of business and they try to put out fresh fruit as much as I can which is a nice change from generally most Asian buffets I will eat there again and you can actually afford to"}
{"text":"When I get the urge for chinese food, this place is right down the street, and fills my needs at a reasonable price.    As with all of these inexpensive buffets, there is good and there is bad, but the \"goods\" are worth coming back for, especially at a price that is less that a single item at almost all the non-buffet chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Pros   Somewhat Friendly Staff.  Good variety of options (includes all of what you expect from a Chinese buffet along with some non-Chinese items such as sausage, pizza, and French fries).  Cons  Food is not replaced often enough so it is fairly old by the time you put it on your plate. Even if it had been initially cooked well, it isn't all that exciting by the time you get it, unless you happen to get a recently refreshed batch of something you like.    The price is pretty high considering the lack of quality.  There are plenty of Chinese buffets at this quality level nearby that are cheaper for lunch and dinner.  And if you are willing to spend another dollar or so, you can eat at a much better restaurant.    It is a fairly run-down looking establishment, although I don't think most people are too concerned about d√©cor when they eat Chinese buffet, but just in case you do, be forewarned."}
{"text":"We stopped in to have lunch with my fam, I was hoping to find a new spot for Chinese food. I thought it would be good bc every time I got by the qt nearby this place is packed. I was disappointed, the only good thing was the fried rice. I tried the honey pork, lo mien, fried white fish, egg rolls and of course the jello. You cant really mess up jello. My hubs had broccoli beef and egg rolls and said it was ok. It looked like the majority of peeps come here for the seafood. I love seafood but refuse to eat it when the establishment cleanliness is questionable."}
{"text":"I've eaten Chinese food all over Phoenix so I can honestly say, you won't find any better buffets around. They have a huge selection of main courses and everything is always hot and fresh. They also have a huge selection of desserts which are always awesome. The building is a little older which may concern some people but inside, the place is clean and well lit. This is my second time eating here, I plan on making this a habit."}
{"text":"I've lived here 7 years and always see the parking lot full, I figured I'd give it a try. Wenton a Friday night around 6 pm...the staff was really nice and attentive- hence the 2 stars. As for the food, small selection first of all, second...I got one plate full, took one bite...cold... another bite.....squishy....and the chicken (it was supposed to be chicken) was horrible. Sometimes I just dislike different sauces, but the actual Meat tasted awful- like it was bad. Maybe it was just a bad night, but either way it was the grossest food I've ever had. On the plus side, I asked the manager for our money back since neither of us could even begin to finish ONE plate and were hating it and she refunded the money without question."}
{"text":"I found a baby roach in the bean sprouts. An employee came over and picked it out with a tissue, then stirred the remaining bean sprouts together, and left it out for people to eat."}
{"text":"disgusting. I only liked the honey chicken choice- very disappointed in the crab puffs because those are my fave and I could even enjoy them. this place is over all bad. not many choices and the flavored of sauces are just not appetizing. neither my boyfriend, our son or myself liked this place."}
{"text":"I like Chinese buffet restaurants and I've just found what is right now my favorite boo-fay in North Phoenix. I decided to check this out today because I was craving Chinese food and happened to read Ryan C's review. He's right - the place may look old with a dumpy facade, but the food is good and the staff is polite. Although it is \"American Chinese\" cuisine, it is higher in quality than most buffets. They use seasonings other buffets scrimp on (sesame oil, anise, etc.), and the food trays are quickly replenished when they begin to run out. And you can't beat the price - the price of lunch, tax included, is $6.16. Thanks, Ryan, for letting me find this gem in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, I'm traveling from state to state currently and stopped here not knowing what to expect. I can honestly say that everything is clean and the food is super fresh (not to mention very tasty) definitely no baby cockroaches in any of the food I will be coming here again next time I stop by."}
{"text":"I normally don't complain and I love Chinese restaurants but this was horrible. The food was cold, and oily, not to mention there isn't much to chose from and it's horrible. We are from out of town and staying at the hotel near by, once we got back to the hotel my husband complained he wasn't feeling very well. Later that same night he ended up throwing up everything he ate, and this man never gets sick! I warn you to stay away, before we even left they cleaned off our table and threw our drinks and all away and didn't even have anyone else there so I don't know what the hurry was and the fact he was begging me to leave I knew something was wrong. I feel so bad because I picked this place and he ended up getting sick. Please don't go, it's dirty and gross, and I don't want anyone or their family getting sick! Stay away!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big complainer, I came because I've never been to this buffet before my one trip so I figured I'd try it out.  Food was 5/10 taste wise, not an issue. Afterwards, I drove home (5 miles) and 3/4 of the way home I could feel my body involentarily prepping to get rid of what I put ina there.  Luckily it was timed well enough that it was all at home.  I wasn't sick before, and I wasn't sick after, my body just forcefully needed to make that food exit, for some reason.  I know it sounds disgusting, but I had to share since I normally have an iron stomach when it comes to food types. I'm not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"It is funny how things work. I took my 12 year old here to eat because she wanted Chinese Boo-fay. I decided to look at Uncle Ryan C's reviews because he knows cheap Boo-fays. This one was the highest rated and closest to the house. So how bad could it be. In fact he had lunch here the very same day.   Location -1 star, this strip mall sucks. There were guys smoking 2 ft from the door. The building is U&gt;G&gt;L&gt;Y stuff falling off the overhang, bad paint, i almost got ran over walking out to my car, sketchy patrons etc.   Interior -1 star this place was a Carrows at one time I am sure of it. When is the last time you saw a Carrows in Phoenix.... yep the decor is that old. As mentioned they recently painted and hung blinds. I could not imagine this place before.   Service 3 stars very nice attentive and not intrusive.   Food 2 stars at best. The food was just there. Nothing stood out, nothing was horrible. I sampled almost everything there except the seafood. I had made a deal with my colon years ago to stop eating buffet seafood.   Ice cream machine -1 star... would have rather had ice chips.   I doubt I would be back. There are plenty of other cheap places that have higher quality nicer ambiance and closer to my house."}
{"text":"The food was cold... the price reasonable.  but i wont be back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Awesome value and pretty good quality for a Chinese buffet. I really like their crab! Great flavor unlike those watered-down just defrosted snow crab legs from the other places. Nice and friendly service."}
{"text":"We got a coupon for this place so decided to try it.  We didn't expect much for $6.50 for a Sunday dinner.  The place was packed.  Some of the trays were empty when we went for the 1st plate.  The worker bees were busy. kept the place and tables clean.  Food was ok, nothing out of the ordinary.  The crab was a big hit except everytime I was up there, the tray was empty.  I'd rather pay a bit more and go to a place I like better.  For the money tho, it was average."}
{"text":"I wish I could have put 0 stars because that's how bad this place is. I never have had such horrible food before. Please don't waste your time or money! The vegetable noodles tasted like fish the damn pineapple come out of a can. My friend ate the Orange chicken and she said it was like eating rubber not even 5 mins later she was sharting in the restroom. The crab puff taste like they used the cheapest cream cheese ever made it was almost inedible actually all the food is. I filled up on the salad which was mediocre. The fried rice taste so bland like wtf, Just the looks of the place I felt disgusted. Even the restroom had paper everywhere. That fact that this is a Chinese buffet and they have pizza and fries says it all. The pizza looked like cardboard with cheese on it. I wouldn't even feed a homeless person this food. I wanted to as for a refund after 2 bites but I was embarrassed , my friend and I laughed so much because we couldn't believe how horrible the food is. Please stay away your better off at McDonald's or eating of a trash can."}
{"text":"On any other day I would have passed on eating here. But it's Christmas and I'm not from AZ so I'm not sure what else would be open as I got further north on the 17. $6.99 was an ok price to put some food in me, but nothing I ate was all that appealing. Usually there's at least one or two items that I'll go back for. Oh well, not every meal can be a winner."}
{"text":"It is near my house and we eat here all the time.  It is very affordable and delicious!  Workers seem nice and I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Alright so the atmosphere itself isnt very good bordering on gross chinese place and def outdated. However the food itself is down right delicious. It can be hard to find an authentic tasting Chinese place on the west coast but this place has some of the best tasting Chinese Ive had in years! They dont fry their teriyaki chicken which I hate and most places do nowadays. It is the best tasting teriyaki chicken, just how I remember it as a kid in the mall. They have might not have the largest selection but for the price it is just fine by me. Also what they do have tends to be my favorite stuff-egg fu young, orange chicken, wonton soup, honey chicken, bbq pork ribs, mei fun, pork fried rice, pork dumplings, egg rolls/spring rolls, crab, donuts, cream cheese puffs, french fries, corn...etc. They also also have tons of condiments and great soy sauce. Also they offer take out option for a cheaper price if u just want a container of stuff. I will come back here!"}
{"text":"Never again. My husband  had a plate of veg fried rice and 1 egg roll. Refused to try anything else.  I found the sweet &sour  chicken ok.  Egg rolls were old on the inside, eww. Chocolate  ice cream  was fine.  You get ur own drinks, just an fyi.   The place was packed."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place.  There are a lot of Chinese seafood buffets around town and this one was the worst.  It's right by my new house so I thought I'd give it a try in hopes that it would be good and close.  Walked in to them over charging a group with a couple children.  They have different prices for every year!! Lol!! Food was blah, barely finished my plate at a buffet...shame!  Cheap but you get what you pay for. Kinda dirty.  Great table service by a cute young lady, but won't ever come back."}
{"text":"This was the worst Chinese food I've ever had! First off, you walk in to an immediate and overwhelming smell of fish.. but in like an old stale kind of way. I am open minded and was happy to try a little bit of everything, although they had very little options.  The part that set me off the worst was the appearance of the food. Everything just looked stale and oily and it all had a weird color. I was about 5 bites in when I just couldn't take it anymore. I was so disgusted I walked away from a full plate of food and left. I hate to be wasteful but each bite was becoming more of a struggle to keep down. If I could rate this place less than one star I would."}
{"text":"Worst, dirty, not clean.Food is cold, bugs Restrooms are gross, always have graffiti all over, no one wears gloves"}
{"text":"I've been hungry for some decent Chinese food for quite a  while.  I noticed China Harvest had a coupon that came in the mail.  Today I decided to drive over and see if it was any good..  I've been there about 8 years ago and wanted to give it another chance.  Stupid me.    When I walked in they had me pay right away.  Now I know why, people probably either left without paying or refused to pay.  I should have walked out.  The place seemed clean and the waitress was good at cleaning off the tables.  So I started filling my plate and sat down.  Orange chicken was just OK, not good but OK.  The jalapeno chicken was horrible, very tough to chew like rubber.  I was very disappointed since I really only will eat a few things from Chinese places.    Next plate.  I tried the honey ribs, again tough as rubber.  The honey chicken was OK but not great.  The crispy wings weren't very good,  I'm a wing guy so another disappointment.  The diet Coke was mixed very wrong.  It tasted like pure chemicals, mixed way to strong.  No way I was going to try the water  Next plate.  Since I was still starving I decided to try some fries. Who could screw up fries. They were actually very good so I had to fill up on fries.  I did try the sweet and sour chicken but the sauce was either very bland or watered down.  On the way home I started feeling like I almost had to pull over and stick my head out the window.  I should have known better!   Next time I want Chinese food I'm going to Panda Express.  I know it's good but a little expensive.  I will never eat there again nor go to any other Chinese food place here in Phx.  Finding a good one is just too tough."}
{"text":"We popped in for a quick bite before shopping at the armadillo and low expectations but we were amazed at the quality of the food.  The meat wasn't all dried out, everything was exceptionally good.  I wanted to post a review and saw the low average rating but we were really impressed.  We will certainly come back."}
{"text":"I wanted to update the review since China Harvest has updated their decor!  If you've been there in the last few years, you've seen the weird shade of green that accented all of the white-ish walls.  If you're like me, you grew to like the odd green color for its strangely soothing quality; I can't help but be reminded of a 1940's mental institution.  Well that has all changed (KIND OF) since the walls have a fresh coat of off-white-wash, and the accent color has been changed to a lovely, putrid, baby shit yellow-brownish; I can't help but be reminded of the classy and stylish 1960's Harvest Gold kitchen appliances.  Technically, it is an improvement, although you have to question the judgement call on the color selection.  Perhaps for the person in charge of that choice, the mental institution green was just a little too appropo?!?  They also put up some very nice wide-slat wood blinds with a medium dark wood stain tint.  They do a great job at blocking out the harsh sun, or even harsher Food City parking lot that graces your window view.  Still cheap and still usually great, just not consistent.  Another recent improvement is steamed white rice in a rice cooker for you to scoop from instead of from a dish on the steamtable.  Keeps the rice nice and fluffy instead of it turning into crunchy toothbreakers.  Still my 4 star goto cheapo china boofay."}
{"text":"Ordinarily just 'bang for the buck' in these economic times would be enough to give a buffet fivers. We've been going here for years, ever since we lived about a mile away.  The variety, flavor and cleanliness of this family owned Chinese buffet has been consistent.On top of that the price has not wavered and perhaps bumped down w/o compromising in any aspect. It is popular with a variety of people even Asians. That alone speaks to authenticity as well.  After our latest meal last week we headed to another 'one of a kind'place to work off the calories. Newly opened, the Phoenix Badminton Center...8 indoor world class courts with all the necessary perks for a ton of fun and you don't realize your'e knocking off the pounds either. Brilliant I say, just downright brilliant!  Our company loved it so much, they want to do this combo often on a regular basis. We're hooked....Chinese and Badminton, how can you go wrong? Such a rarity in the Phoenix area. To top it all they're only less than 10 mts. apart by freeway. I think the 'ton' in badminton (indoors) must stand for a TON of FUN! Wow, we're blown away!"}
{"text":"Not perfect and not without some flaws, but by and large this is probably the buffet restaurant I visit the most.    There's basically two major things to be aware of - (1) you'll frequently see items placed in bins marked with a label for a different food...look before you leap!  Trust your eyes and common sense, not necessarily what the signs tell you!  (2) If you're anxiously awaiting the dessert, stick to the dessert table and avoid the softserve ice cream machine as it can be very scary and unsettling.  If you're saving ice cream for last, it can make a not so nice final impression before you leave!    The staff (despite their tendency to yell loud Chinese across the window separating the kitchen from the dining room) is generally very friendly and attentive.  Dishes are frequently replenished.  Even though you can generally have an idea what to expect after you've visited enough times, there's still the occasional pleasant surprise - on my last visit they had some different cakes I hadn't seen them offer before.  Some of my favorite items here are the orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, butter potatoes, shrimp, and especially the hot and sour soup.  Their most inconsistent dish are the crab puffs - sometimes bordering on perfection, other times rather sad."}
