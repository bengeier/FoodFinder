{"text":"A great place to get a drink with friends after work. There bar is well priced, the wait staff is awesome! The food is better than usual bar food, because it is also an Italian restaurant, and the food is good."}
{"text":"Best wedding soup and the unique cheese syeak os remarkable; this is a must visit place in the north hills"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a fish sandwich today for lent. This was hands down the most disgraceful excuse for food I've ever been served.  I took two bites of my sandwich and asked for my check, the bar tender didn't even question  that i was leaving without eating my food. I could care less about the money, but I am appalled that she didn't give a rats hat about my dining experience.  This place used to be pretty good, no more. I will never go back. Obviously they have carved out a niche with customers who don't seem to care about good service or food quality.  I can tell the genius in the kitchen has no real skill, other than being able to assemble  prepared frozen foods and ready made Pizza dough and sauce. Here's a tip Casey, when you fry fish, first rinse the slime off it, second dry the fish, third dredge in flour, fourth dip in wet batter, fifth you may deep fry now. By doing this the batter stays on the fish you imbeciles. Lastly, it wouldn't kill you to change you fryer oil."}
{"text":"Great Seafood Pizza. I always order the medium to get the thick crust. The mini thin crust is just not enough for me. Service and price are good. We come here about once per week."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Friendly wait staff. Bartenders are great, too!  Wedding soup is best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"We figured we would try this place instead a chain restaurant trying to support local business, but that was a bad idea.  Ordered a reuben and it was nasty, they grilled the meat and not the bread!!   Who wants a reuben without grilled bread? and dryed out grilled meat? Also got the antipasta salad, would have been better with more topping and none of the house tomato blend which is tomatoes in various sizes, large pieces of onions and some green pepper with way to much oregano.  I guess it is italian salsa and it sucks.  I guess it is a good way to use cheaper banged up tomatoes.  The menu says it is on the steak hoagie too and I can imagine how nasty that would make a steak hoagie.  I would never go back."}
{"text":"A great restaurant to stop after work, for lunch, or casual dinner. Good pizza, excellent salads, and good hoagies. A place where locals go.  Service is always good and the food comes quickly."}
{"text":"Decent prices and super friendly wait staff.  Everyone says their pizza is great but it is honestly not my style.  I am a fan of their seafood salad during Lent, and it gets super busy for fish sandwiches.  Nice little family restaurant and bar."}
{"text":"Asbsolutely love this place.  This is a regular place for the family.  The food is fantastic.  A wide variety for everyone.  The wait staff are great too.  I definitely recommend this family restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great local Pizza Restaurant. Toppings are fresh. Hoagies are very delicious. Provolone wheels are excellent. Service was very fast and waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"The little bar that could!  Really it is a restaurant.   When you walk in the door you notice a wrap around bar.  I ordered the pizza and had a couple of draft beers.    The bartenders were very nice.    Being a traveler, bartenders provide me the most non-work conversation for the day.    The bartenders were fun to be around and played or picked on all the regulars which was nice.  The pizza was good but nothing to jump out of a tree over.    The cost of the whole evening was very cheap.  I will definitely go back to the restaurant / bar.  Food - Pretty good and well worth the price Service - Awesome - friendly folks who were engaging and there when they needed to be Price - Cheap - if you are on a budget - you should check this gem out."}
{"text":"It's honest, working-class food served in an honest working-class way.  If you want a night out that involves family, televisions, karaoke, and pizza, come here!  Once in a while I get nostalgic for my North Hills relatives and go here to remember the old days growing up north of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this pizza. They had one with a thicker crust and when I opened the box, it looked so good.   However, this is where it goes south. The crust on the thick pizza was very dry and hard. The sauce was also bland, acidic, and tasted like tomato sauce straight from the can with no added seasonings.   The thin crust was equally disappointing. It was paper thin and very greasy and the crust just tasted off. I cant really describe it, but it just wasn't good.   This place was packed so I'm thinking their other food is pretty good, but all I tried was the pizza."}
{"text":"Nice little place , very clean, half decent bar area and a solid draft list. Tried the meatball hoagie and bbq wings. Both were solid, wings were crispy and super tasty. Grilled chicken salad was really big, lots of cheese and chicken and marinated tomatoes which make the whole salad. Very nice waitress who took care of everything we needed. Great food for the low prices. Will be back."}
