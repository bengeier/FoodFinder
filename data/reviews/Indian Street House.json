{"text":"Ordered from here through Skip the Dishes. We ordered butter chicken, saffron rice and plain naan. Butter chicken was spicy and didn't have enough cream in it to round out and smooth the flavors. Very little chicken, mostly sauce. Rice was a bit dry, nothing special. The naan was the best part. All in all we won't be ordering from here again. There are far better Indian food places in the city."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage Indian food, this is the second time we tried this place ordering different items each time. Wasted $100 on this..... dosa was small,tasted like rubber and wasn't even properly made, Sambar was pathetic, Hakka noodles like Mr.Noodles. Their was no difference in their poori and bhataria or wte it was just a big clumpy tasteless dough. So disappointed really had hoped we had another Indian restaurant nearby. I highly doubt any of the below reviews are real probably just family members"}
{"text":"Indian Street House has the best Indian food in south Calgary! There are so many vegetarian options, which is really great!   The food is excellent, our favourites were the vegetables noodles, pani puri, aloo tikki chaat, and jamun. Everything is very flavourful and the portion sizes are fair for the price. The display is one of the best I've seen!   Service is fast, however my group were the only people in the restaurant at the time (around 4pm) so all attention was on us. The restaurant is owned by 3 young restauranteurs, they were all very friendly and welcoming, and a pleasure to talk to. ( I should also mention, we were having car troubles upon leaving, and the owner was nice enough to help us jump-start our car!)  Overall amazing food, clean establishment, wonderful service, I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"In a small strip mall, it doesn't look like much from the outside but is quite nice and tastefully decorated once you are in.  Most importantly, the food is exceptional!  Super flavourful, super fresh, and a really unique menu with the street food and South Indian options.  My husband and I usually go for dosas and the particularly yummy samosa chaat when we go here or get takeout -- they are excellent.  Loads of vegetarian and gluten free options, so there is something for everyone. When I took my parents, even my mom, who is usually not the biggest fan of Indian food, said, \"This may be my new favourite restaurant!\"  The service is extremely attentive and friendly.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very clean Indian food. Also the appetizers and the Indian chats are very authentic. The service is very warm as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best Indian Street Food restaurants in the city. Awesome food, Exceptional service, very clean and beautifully build up from inside ..! Friendly staff and amazing food.... highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you're the owner of ISH please reply to the libelous review by \"Shamus\" with the alleged photo of an insect that he claimed to find in your food. He posts the identical photo for at least two other geographically disparate Indian restaurants, both in the US and thousands of miles from your fine establishment. I have reported this review and his profile.  We don't even HAVE cockroaches in Calgary.  All that said, ISH serves beautiful food!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food, knowledgeable staff to answer menu questions (including my friend's vegan options inquiry, of which they have several), and nice decor. They were pretty quiet when we got there at 5 but very busy with deliveries and tables starting to fill when we left at 6:30. I'll definitely be back to try the other menu options as I left feeling incredibly full! My only criticism is that the naan was a little tough, but still delicious enough that I stuffed myself trying to sop up all the tasty sauce."}
