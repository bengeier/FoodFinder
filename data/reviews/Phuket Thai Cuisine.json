{"text":"Tried  this place for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised. This unassuming strip mall restaurant delivered bold tastes, excellent service and a great dining experience. 
We started off with fried tofu with a delicious sweet dipping sauce. This was so yummy! I had a vegan version of the tofu pad thai (no egg) and my boyfriend had the chicken sweet and sour. Both dishes were big portions, hot and flavorful.  The only complaint my BF had was that he could have used more meat in the dish. My BF finished off dinner with creamy delicious coconut icecream.
Great experience and we will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"The dood was Delicious and the service was great and the atmosphere was very nice. Excited to know they will be serving wine soon."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time, and had an excellent meal. We had angel wings, which were crispy and had good sauce. We also had green curry and pad kee mow. 

The curry was very good, some places make curry very sweet, but this was just lightly sweet and chock full of carrots, green beans, bell pepper, and bamboo shoots.

We also both really enjoyed the pad kee mow, very good flavor and the noodles were great.

We finished off with mango sticky rice, also delicious.

All in all, we very much enjoyed the meal.

The service was a little slow, and the server forgot to bring the Thai iced tea. The presentation wasn't as elegant as some places, but that's pretty minor.

We're planning to go back soon, the other dishes all look delicious also and we want to try most of them."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Thai restaurant in south Chandler.  If you are looking for the standard noodle, curry, or rice dishes Phuket Thai fits the bill.  You get 10% off also if you pay by cash.

Order the Pad See Ewe beef and Thai Fried Rice, always consistently delicious."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would! Ok half a star for the appetizer platter and the server. 1. We were there a year ago and it was just as bad. 2. It was sooo hot in there. 3. The pad prik King was flavorless, bland, and soupy and tasted NOTHING LIKE pad prik king AND the green beans were hard and rubbery . 4. The yellow curry was actually pretty good tho..another .5 star for that...hence the one star rating!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious...The Thai basil was the best!! It's a small sit in place but the food was worth it! Servers were very friendly as well :) and you get 10% off if you pay cash!!"}
{"text":"Love the food at the place with the phunny name!!  The Won Ton soup is a must try.  It comes in a hot pot, with a steno heater underneath to keep it hot.  It takes a few minutes to come out, but it's well worth the wait.

I also had the snow pea pods stir fry over brown rice.  Delish!!  A friend also ordered the pineapple fried rice, which also includes some cashews.  Delicious!

Also, they offer a 10% discount if you pay your bill in cash.

The one minor area for improvement would be that the service could be a little faster, and I hate when restaurants put the chairs up on the tables all around you when you are still enjoying your meal.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Revisited restaurant twice since last review and service was soooooo slow, one time we were there for over 2 hours before our food came out ALSO asked for thai hot and it was barely hot. Very inconsistent....very unorganized, not sure what happened to this place.....its gone downhill."}
{"text":"Thai never disappoints and so does this place. Love the tom yum soup here, i can just go to this place for that. The food is pretty good as well and same goes for customer service."}
{"text":"If I could I would leave no stars. This place is way overpriced for the portions of curry they give you. Even with 10% off with cash, it is still expensive. Also very poor quality Curry. It's not flavourful at all. Charm Thai cuisine gives you double the portion of Curry at a better value and it's great tasting curry. I would have gone to Charm Thai cuisine but I thought I'd save a little extra cash by taking advantage of Phuket Thai's 10% off. Well that ended up backfiring on me. Definitely won't be back there."}
{"text":"Tried phuket Thai for the first time, my wife had the lunch special green curry, still ended up with enough leftover for another lunch.  I asked if they had any whole fish dishes, the owner made an off menu pompano fish in red curry.  The ginger tea and Thai coffee were tasty and we finished with homemade coconut ice cream.  Bring cash and save 10%.  Quantity and quality were good, service was a little slow."}
{"text":"Stopped in and ordered take out and was a bit let down in this place. My pad Thai was super sticky, dry and shrimp was not good. Loved the spring rolls and dumplings. The dipping sauce for egg rolls was yummy. Sweet & sour veggie dish with tofu was awful as the tofu was way too rubbery and s&s sauce not good (dumped the whole thing out). Soup was good. I would say just a fair experience and don't think we would go back considering the price for 2 out of 3 dishes we were unhappy with. The lady working there was so nice so that was good, but just didn't like two of dishes. Bummer."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We go there at least twice a month and have never had a bad meal. Their spiciness range from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most spicy. We stay at 2-3, and they are always consistent. There's also many different dishes on their menu to choose from, most I've tried and they're all good.

The place is always clean and staff is friendly.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great chicken soup and spicy thai rice. Will be coming back soon to try some other dishes. Great food, great value."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and everything we've tried has been excellent! Fresh food, friendly staff. One of our favorite places to go for Thai food."}
{"text":"Good food, decent price, nice customer service, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great Thai food! Wonderful selection. Family owned. I like the atmosphere, very clean. The customer service is good. Very attentive and nice. They have a good selection of meat and vegetarian choices. I will definitely bring my family and friends here!"}
{"text":"Awesome new restaurant in Southern Chandler!  I'm not usually a huge fan of Thai food, but went because husband likes it.  Went there late afternoon on a Saturday.  It was very quiet, but started to pick up as we were ready to leave.  Wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  Had the Princess Coconut.  It was awesome!  Full of flavor, just the right amount of heat.  They let you choose your own \"heat\" on a scale of 1 (mild) to 4 (really spicy).  Perfect!  Husband had Yellow Curry, which he also proclaimed delicious.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I try not to review a place I've only been to once or twice. The fact that I've been here 4 times in the past 2 weeks for lunch should tell you we love it. 

The Spicy Cashew Nuts spice level 2 is my favorite dish so far and the homemade coconut ice cream is a fabulous treat!

The people are very friendly and we find the service to be quite quick. The \"pay cash get 10% off\" makes me question their business sense since most credit card companies charge only 5%, but it dies not make me think any less of the food. It's excellent!"}
{"text":"Amazing pad Thai and panang curry. Attentive wait staff and comfortable, casual environment. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and reasonable price. I ordered the Tom Ka Gai soup, it was awesome and the portion size huge. I like how they served it over a hot burner. Plenty of leftovers for home. The same goes for the green curry. I had enough for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"We ate at a restaurant in the same shopping center last week and noticed this Thai restaurant as we where leaving. I looked it up on line to check their reviews. Good Thai food in the south east valley has been hard to find. We went last night and were delighted with the food and staff. The portions are generous which was a bonus. We ordered two entries and my wife was able to take food home. This will be our new go to Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"As my experience goes this place is much too sweet. The waiter explained that the sauces are pre-packaged and they do not control the taste while arguing that sauce was not sweet.  If I was at IHOP with a plate of pancakes the sauce would have been perfect."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The wings for appetizers are a favorite as well as the coconut ice cream for dessert. The yellow curry is very good and spice lovers the kitchen will make as hot as you desire....level 5 and beyond!!"}
{"text":"Love the dine-in atmosphere and friendly staff! Huge menu and great taste. Fast take-out. Happy this is in Chandler."}
{"text":"10% off if you pay your bill in cash- Great food, friendly and quick service, spice was just right, meal was hot when brought to the table. Take out if needed and kid friendly! Definitely coming back to try more selections!"}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on yelp for the first time because its pretty new. I am always looking for good pad kee mao and now I found one in chandler. Had great flavor but could use a little more meat. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I've been here previously and have always been satisfied.  However, last night we still had not been served our food after waiting for almost an hour.  We ended up walking out.  If they were understaffed, it would have helped if they informed the customers that there could be a long wait, this way it gives the customer an option to stay or leave.  Maybe this was an aberration but I've never had to wait that long for food in my entire life."}
{"text":"Friendly service! Discount for paying cash! Delicious food! Picked up food for movie night Pad Thai w/ shrimp & Thai Basil w/ beef, yum!"}
{"text":"Went here with my daughter and her boyfriend.   Was a little disappointed that they do not serve alcohol.   We're very pleased with or Tom Yum soup, very tasty.   Food was excellent.   My daughter, because she loves coconut, had the coconut ice cream and she loved it.  Will go here again."}
{"text":"Food is alright but service is awful. This is the third time we have been here and every single time same type of service just SLOW. 
We are waiting for 40 minutes and food is not out yet :("}
{"text":"This was excellent food! It was very good and I highly recommend this establishment if you are looking for a great Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Read reviews and decided to give this place a try, we were not disappointed. I like how you can select the spice level, and food was delicious. A little nervous since we arrived around 6 pm and were the only ones there. By the time we left the place was full! I had the Cashew Nut with chicken and will be ordering again. Husband had chicken fried rice and that was a hit as well. Hope they stay in business as it is our new favorite!"}
{"text":"The duck curry was delicious. The service was great. The ambiance, except for a few nice pictures on the walls, was more like a pizza place. I'll be coming back for the food often. It just took over first place on my Phoenix area thai restaurant list."}
{"text":"Really good food and service at a reasonable price.  That pretty much sums it up for us.  We felt fortunate to get a table quickly during dinner hour.  Definitely on our list for return visits!"}
{"text":"This is THE best place in Arizona!!!!!!! Hands down the best Thai food around and the servers are so friendly, the owner is always there and comes over to check on us all the time. Great place!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to eat after my  Gym work out.   walked to Panda Express ,   then i saw the New Thai food been open,      Phuket Thai Cuisine  ,  on 4040 S Arizona ave ,  chandler .

i walked in   there is like  15 -20 tables or so.   place look  very well,  very  clean,  very nice. 
was  not busy,  but  its a  Tuesday night .    
the  menu is great,  they have it all.    the food  was good.   or  good +  .  i  really liked it,  and will go there many  times again.

service?   well  its a new place, i think  they  still learning  ,   but they  was very  good,  very  polite,  was this  sweet lady ,  who help the server ,  she  was FUN!!!   overall   i  had a  great meal,  and had a good  time!   well done  and best of luck to the new place in my hood"}
{"text":"Their panage is our favorite. The curry is very thick not runny as many other restaurants. 4 out of 5 stars just base on the curry- had the tom kah chicken once and was not impressed. We honestly just come here for the panage."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food in a quiet, pleasant atmosphere. Flavors of most dishes were rich and deep. Would skip the sampler appetizer."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, nice ambience! Loved it for lunch. Wonderful yellow curry."}
{"text":"No, no, no!!!!! Had such high hopes for this place since it was close to home. Why are reviews so high? Their curry is thin and watery and all my dishes literally had no flavor. They are devoid of any taste or spices. Panda Express is disgusting and yet I think I would have had a better experience there. Run people!!!"}
{"text":"Came to the plaza for fake Chinese food because we were tired of throwing out options and decided to  try Phuket instead. And it was definitely a good choice. I'm a curry girl and the brother is a cashew chicken fella. Levels 2 and 3 respectively. We were both quite satisfied with our decisions and we are definitely going to give this little place another go.

The acoustics are less than great and there was a very adorable, very happy child with quite the set of pipes singing (we'll call it singing) for the first 15 minutes we were here and it literally bounced off the walls of the room. Small, quaint, cute, clean. The food we ordered was quite flavorful! But as another reviewer said...perhaps a tad more meat?"}
{"text":"My favorite dishes are the Yellow Curry and the Pad Thai. We ordered to-go and the worker that was assisting me through the phone was very helpful when I had questions about some of the items on the menu. 

Can't go wrong with the Pad Thai here! The noodles are cooked to perfection. The Yellow Curry sauce tasted like coconut milk, which adds a little sweetness to the dish. 

I feel like the dishes are overpriced in relation to how much food they give you, especially when you order to-go!"}
{"text":"The food tastes fine but we had the same problem as last time-they didn't give us enough chicken in the dishes we ordered.  And tonight they were so incredibly slow and they weren't that busy.  Not sure we are going back because we don't want to have to wait over 45 minutes for our food again."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have had so far in the Phoenix area. The staff is always friendly.  Tried the Thai custard for the first time this week.  So good!! If you love Thai food, try this place!"}
{"text":"This is pretty good spot. You get 5% off for paying cash, food was good, service was good, interior decorations and color schemes are well done."}
{"text":"This place is great! The peanut sauce they use on their house salad for lunch is to die for. It's all homemade too! The Pad Thai was good and my favorite, pad see ew is delish! Sad to see it's not on the lunch menu :( I would also recommend getting an order of their spring rolls. They are very crispy!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 18 people. Taste is really good but portion size is small for the price. Usually dinner plate, in other Thai restaurants is enough to share between two. Here it is like lunch size."}
{"text":"Decent food, great service...pad Thai was solid, green curry was flavorful, would not go out of the way for it but good Thai spot and nice decor."}
{"text":"I've had take-out here a few times already, mostly the curry chicken or curry beef.  Their curry is quite sweet, I'm sure they put a lot of sugar in there.  It's a little too sweet for me... but, then again, we don't have many Thai options around this neck of the woods and sometimes I just want my Thai curry.  Oh well, I'll deal.

They over 10% discount if you pay cash... ummm.. can I say TAX FRAUD??  Not my problem, I never seem to have cash on me anyway :P"}
{"text":"The cuisine is authentic and 5 star quality in every way.  Great ambiance.  Clean.  Service is hit & miss. Tonight they were clearly understaffed.  The two people serving 15+ tables were also helping  in the kitchen.  Forget refills or appetizers before the entrées.  But the food is so good I still have to give them 4 stars.   Bring cash so you're not held hostage while waiting for a check and to have your credit card processed."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! Phuket Thai was quickly added to my Thai restaurant options after I tried their Pad Thai. I have returned since, multiple times, to get the Pad Thai but also to try out other menu items.

All their food is freshly prepared after placing the order. Sometimes it takes some time for them to get everything out since they have a fairly small kitchen and only a few staff members, however the staff is always attentive and the food is good! Everything I have had has always been flavorful and the spice levels were as expected. If I'm getting a curry, I normally order it with medium spice, and it comes out with the perfect amount of heat.

Overall, a good option when you're in the area. Their prices are fair, so I wouldn't hesitate to stop in."}
{"text":"Used to live down in chandler and this was the go to place for Thai food.

Good value for the food quality and service was attentive and met expectations.

Things to try, if you go visit - Beef salad, Yellow curry, Pad Thai and the Tom Kha..."}
{"text":"Went to place an order for takeout because I could not find an online menu. Took 20 minutes to get the food. The food was very good and the gentleman taking the order was very nice. Will definitely get again."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  All the one star reviews have to do with the time it takes to get your food.. Everything is made to order so the food you get is prepared when you order it.  It's a great place to slow down and enjoy the company you are with.  Have a Thai coffee and the beef panang and relax. This place is great!"}
{"text":"This place is just OK, nothing special. They offer your common dishes like Pad Thai and curries. and are competently done. I do like that your lunch special comes with a house salad with peanut sauce dressing (a little heavy) for my taste, and a vegetable egg roll. We enjoyed it enough but I think there are better options in town."}
{"text":"Sawatdeeka = hello in Thai. On the hunt or crave for more noodles i stumbled upon Phuket Thai cuisine. 

Pad kee Mao with chicken was ordered with a spicy level of 1 which was a little on the too mild side. Had all the tasty ingredients of green bell peppers, basil, carrots, jalapeño and onions. Always a good dish. Under $11

Siam fish with yellow curry - crispy fish was quite delicious. The white fish was buried underneath the level 2 spicy yellow curry with carrots, basil, onions. Comes with side of rice. $14

Spicy Angel Wings- was overcooked and difficult to gnaw at the meat. Spicy level was not as spicy as I expected. This is a dish I would skip. $8

Coconut ice cream was cool and cleansing to the palate! Yum! 

Either I was too hungry or the food took longer than expected but overall service was excellent."}
{"text":"It was good, FYI- their spice scale is low; so I chose medium, but I probably could have gone two or three levels higher.
Good lunch service."}
{"text":"Phuket is consistently good and very affordable.  The atmosphere is typical strip mall plain jane, but for a fast, fresh, inexpensive Thai lunch it's hard to find a better place."}
{"text":"I have heard great things about this place and I was really looking forward to taking my wife here.  We tried once but it was a Monday (I think) and they were closed.  I finally decided to surprise her with a trip to a place I heard was so good.  

We walked in to no greeting.  There is no sign saying to seat or yourself or wait to be seated.  We stood like idiots for a bit while a women worked behind the bar, not noticing us My wife finally approached her and we were seated.  I ordered the Pad Thai and she ordered the House soup.  

My food was brought out and we waited 10min or so and saw a bowl of soup being brought out.  It was taken to another customer.  No one stopped to see how our meal was, if we needed refills, if we needed anything.  Finally I stood up and asked the other person working the front where my wife's soup was.  There was some commotion when they figured out they had delivered the wrong order to the gentleman at the bar.  Another 10min later when my food was almost gone they finally brought my wife's soup.

My wife took a bit of one of the large pieces of squid, gagged, and spit it out.  She then \"fished\" out the rest of it.  The broth was bland, the texture of the pork balls is seems like they took the name a little to literally.  

Phuket?  Phukthat."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed lunch here today. I had the Pad Thai and it was delicious. More veggies than the Pad Thai I have had at most places. The rolls that come on the plate were awesome. Very crispy and I could have eaten a whole plate of just those! We also started with dumplings and they were very good! They bring each plate out as it is ready which can be a little annoying when you have multiple people but the trade off is that it does come out super hot! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food the two times I've come in. They give a cash discount too. I'll return!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My husband and I absolutely love their Pad Thai. We normally order for pick up and often wish they delivered, but the food is worth the drive. We also have taken many out of town guests there and everyone has loved it so far. I would highly recommend. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tried this place and the staff was super friendly! However, the flavor of the food fell flat. I'm not taking off stars for flavor. I suspect that many a snow bird from Minnesota or Wisconsin might think highly of this place when they go back to Sun Lakes after having supper at 4 pm. But not me. I suspect this place holds back on true flavors of the Thai cuisine based on the demographic surroundings it finds itself in. And that's a shame, but as a restaurant you gotta do what you gotta do to survive in this world. This is a one and done for me. With a name like Phuket I thought this might be a find but I was wrong. But my wrong might be your right, so give it try and tell others what you think.  I like it bold and flavorful with no holding back."}
{"text":"Food is solid. Better than our cities other thai options for sure! Veggie fried rice is great, not greasy, and properly cooked. The spicy tofu with cashew is Damn delicious. I'll return often for that dish alone. Incredibly friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've found in east valley. Great service with outstanding flavor a in Thai classic dishes."}
{"text":"Had the beef salad, pad thai, and the combo appetizer. Winner, winner!  I wouldn't say it was amazing,  but it was all pretty tasty"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and the food was delicious! They have high chairs to accommodate the little ones, but don't expect a kids menu. Everything is pretty standard for Thai restaurant menu. The interior is simple and clean. Wish they had kid drinks like juices and maybe coloring sheets/placemats to keep the kids entertained."}
{"text":"Best Thai place I've had. The staff is really friendly and very attentive. They checked on us regularly. Portions are a great size. 

The yellow curry is awesome! Plus they're the only place I've been to that serves duck which my boyfriend said was one of the best plates he's had. 

The overall look of the place is modern and pretty cool. And they have accurate photos of their food in the menu and on the walls. 

Plus they give you 10% off when you pay with cash."}
{"text":"We really like this place and go often there to eat. Great prices modest Decour. Try it out"}
{"text":"Tried this place four times.  And I can safely say I will not go agin.  I really did give it a fair chance to make sure it wasn't a one time thing.  They don't have enough servers.  the place was packed with one server.  Waited 20min and no one came to take our order.  We got up and went somewhere else. 
Food is not all that either."}
{"text":"What a great find. Moved neighborhoods recently and had to find a new, closer Thai place. Wow!! This place is GREAT!!! Started with the ginger tea - out of this world!!! I don't know any other Asian restaurant that offers ginger tea...The rest was the same. Each item ordered delivered!! And, definitely get the spicy fried rice (pork)!!!! If you are in the area, you HAVE to go! Arizona & Ocotillo"}
{"text":"I would recommend them to either lowering the price  or serving more food with each order considering the cost/ quantity ratio. Don't get me wrong, I like their food but I believe in fairness and balance. Their Thai curries taste very good but it may seem like a soup as it is a bowl full of coconut milk with all other ingredients on the bottom."}
{"text":"There are many very good Thai restaurants in the valley, but the flavor that comes out of this kitchen is sooooo much better! 

From the very first bite - even the heavenly smell on my way home with take-out - was amazing! Even hubby (who's more a meat n potatoes guy) was delighted with the flavor and freshness of his meal - and that was just the rice bowl with chicken! 

This place is officially on our regular rotation for take-out! Already looking forward to trying other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Spent the last 10 years living in Thailand. Visited Phuket Thai on Friday evening at 5:00 PM. 14 other diners. The restaurant is new, fashionably decorated and very clean. Service is on the slow side, as if this is the owners first restaurant venture.  Food came out before sticky rice etc. The duck (16.95) was very dry and the worst I have ever had. No where close to what you get in Thailand. Pad See You was good, although on the sweet side. The papaya salad was very bland and even at the highest spice level, not spicy at all. Made for Americans is all I can say. Lob (chicken) was tasty. Spicy and sour wings (7.95) for 6 dry wings drenched in excess sauce. Chauhan (thai ice tea) close to original. Ate with my Thai wife and Thai son. It is a nice atmosphere, however, the large size lady is very loud, speaking above the whole restaurant when she takes orders. For my family, we prefer Thai food made for Thais. This is just too bland for our liking. It is quite expensive compared to other Thai restaurants is the area. 10% off for cash, told once we had already ordered. At this time I would not make a repeat visit which is a shame because the food quality does not match the stylish restaurant. Total bill for 3 $80.36."}
{"text":"Customer service is everything. The one star rating comes because this place has none. I place an order for pick up at 5:40 today and the wait time was 40 minutes. Usually when I call for food at Silk Thai it takes about 10 to 20 minutes so 40 was a surprise but my options were limited this evening so I went ahead with the wait.  When I got there I was not greeted at all and was not addressed until I said I was there for my pick up. I was told to hold on while a woman answered the phone and then put that customer on hold too and then when went around the bar and served the only couple in the room. There was a guy getting pick up in front of me and we were both just waiting while she casually took their order seemingly in no rush. After a 40 minute wait to pick up the food and then another 10 at the bar so she could take somebody else's order, I came home with an incorrect order. I had ordered the pad Thai level 2 but when I got home and started eating it was extremely hot and I was given a level 4. My husband who prefers spicy food ordered a level 3 curry and got a level 2 instead. So not only did we have to wait forever but we waited for the wrong food. When I called to share that our entire order was incomplete she only said she would replace my pad Thai, not the curry and she can give me a spice packet to take home for that. I thought that was so rude and cold. I absolutely have no desire to ever come here again."}
{"text":"Very tasty and spicy! Ordered the Thai Basil Tofu. One of the better thai dishes I've ever had. Yum!"}
{"text":"Only giving 4 stars because I have only tried the Thai basil with Tofu. Arguably the best Thai Basil I have ever had so am looking to try other stuff."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! The Pad Thai is very good. Best Thai I've had here! When they say spicy.....they mean it!"}
{"text":"Great place for Thai! It's very clean and inviting and the servers are friendly.  The food is very good, with great flavor and variety."}
{"text":"Excellent menu Tom Kha soup was fabulous! Try spicy  #3 with rice. Very delicious. YUM!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Thai restaurant, clean, service is good, the food is delicious and I'll definitely go back again!!!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ate and the staff are all nice and you get discounts if you pay cash"}
{"text":"People say I have a flare for the dramatic... Especially when it comes to describing restaurant experiences and the food. So, with no intention to be dramatic (this time or truthfully in my previous reviews - I guess it just happens) my first experience here was very pleasant.  

One very nice discovery... (Wish I could say it with the accent like I heard it in)... \"You pay cash you get 10 PAcen off\".  So I did.  Bam!  I was even explained how much I saved.  Cute!

Place is small, a bit of a dank odor (smelled as though it was formerly flooded) but nice, seemingly clean, not a dive at all.  

Since they don't yet have a menu on-line I had to go (for takeout) and order there.  She (the owner it was apparent) said, \"we no yeh do it.  Heya is yaw taye ow menu foe nex time.\"   I swear I love accents and Asian people!!!  Kind, hard working, passionate.  Anyway, might I digress.  

Ok so the food... We ordered the Yellow Curry with chicken which was surprisingly delicious and the Pad Spicy Eggplant with beef which also was very good (Yellow Curry slight better).  The spicy eggplant had a nice basil flavor.  

Big Tip!  Wait for it... Wait for it... So I asked the owner, \"If you were going to take home food for yourself tonight, what would you order?  What are your personal favorites?\"   Answer: Red Curry and Thai (or Spicy) fried rice.  

So there you have it.  The tip from the owner herself.  You can thank me now.  Oh, but wait!  Hold your praise... I didn't order it so I can't say how good it actually was.  Next time... I promise I will order it and then (if really the bomb) you can thank me.  For now, if you want your taste buds blown and you're a fried rice lover get the Jalapeño Fried Rice (comes with their cured sausage) at Malee's On Main in Old Town Scottsdale.  Crazy !  Indescribably delicious.  (Not as spicy as the name implies!)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to in a long time! Authentic and fresh food. Very nice workers and a clean environment."}
{"text":"I have been several times, and the food is good. The curries have good flavor, and the drunken noodles are another favorite. The restaurant is cute, and the severs have been sweet."}
{"text":"good food, sometimes they make it too hot no matter what \"number\" you say.  but, I guess that's Thai food.  sometimes they do not answer the phone to take orders by phone."}
{"text":"We really liked this place! Great food, just don't go if you are in a hurry. The service is very slow. But if you are just looking for a great place to eat with no rush, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Super friendly/clean and the coconut ice cream is amazing! Looking forward to going again!"}
{"text":"Chandlers newest Thai restaurant is fantastic! We're picky about our Thai food and Phuket was amazing! We're working our way through the menu still but it's been a fabulous journey so far. The staff is friendly and go out of their way to make you feel welcome. A true treasure worth visiting over and over!"}
{"text":"Good food 
Good Service

Not spectacular but we go here in a pinch when we crave Thai because it's nearby.  The curry is a little watery but very tasty.  The Pad Thai is very good.  

Will continue to come here until a better place opens nearby or we are up to drive a little further...."}
{"text":"stopped by with my sister a few weeks ago.

i understand that they are super new and might not have everything together yet.  ...but we waited for an hour and a half during lunch.  thirty minutes for our order to be placed... and an hour to get our food.  i definitely wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for something quick on your lunch break.

they were all very sweet though.  the servers seemed very flustered... i don't think they were expecting to be so busy.  

the food was ok.  we had the pad thai and yellow curry.  the curry was alright but the serving was pretty small for the price.  i really wanted to like this place more but i probably won't be returning.  it's not somewhere i would drive out of my way to go to."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often for take out because I work nearby.  The order is always made perfectly- and they really do Thai hot!  I've never had a negative experience here.  Parking can be a bit tight but just be patient- it's absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food here. Highly recommended. I had the yellow curry and a Thai iced tea which is my regular dish at Thai places. It did not disappoint. They also gave me a fresh salad with a delightful peanut sauce type dressing. I will be going back here for sure."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Don't miss this place! BEST Thai in Chandler with fresh ingredients and made to order cuisine! I loved my lunch which was under $10 and came with a yummy spring roll, and white rice. I ordered the veggies and chicken to keep my healthy choices going past Monday!!! LOL"}
{"text":"Food completely lacks flavor. Ordered 3 different dishes and none of them had any taste. Food is also extremely overpriced and you are barely given any quantity. Do not go here if you have any common sense"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings when writing this review, but I'm going to stick to my guns regarding the rating.  If I was giving out stars for food only then this would be 4-5 stars easily, but unfortunately the service takes it down a lot. 

I usually try to get my coworkers to come here instead of the often crowded Pho Chandler across the street, but after this last visit I'm thinking I'm on my own and may have to call ahead for take out.  To say it bluntly, the service is horrible.  During our last visit, we entered and watched for five minutes as the waiters walked around basically ignoring us.  When we made our presence known, the guy comes up to us, asks us how many and then looks around and tells us he doesn't have any tables available.  While waiting I noticed a lady waiting for someone to take her check so she could leave so I pointed to her table still amazed that the guy was going to turn away customers with more people still coming in the door.  

Well, to basically sum it all up, don't go there hungry.  You'll most certainly not enjoy your experience. They are nice, pleasant people, but they need to polish up on tending to customers.  The food is outstanding though."}
{"text":"First time for us and it was great. A friend of ours recommended the restaurant and we now have added this to our favorites. Thank you for the great meal and we'll see you again soon. Great lunch specials and a discount if you pay cash, 5%."}
{"text":"Awesome spicy fried rice. Ordered with fried tofu. Came out perfect and tasted as good as it looked. Will repeat soon."}
{"text":"Yummy Thai tea & their Thai hot is not too spicy.  Their drunken noodles, fried rice, crab puffs & soups are delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've tried a few local Thai places and this one is the best, hands down. It is very clean, nice ambiance and the people who work there are so nice and attentive! The food is outstanding! Today we had the Tom Kha soup, chicken Pad Thai and coconut ice cream. It was all made to perfection and extremely generous portions. We won't go anywhere also!"}
{"text":"Wonderfully tasty food. It feels so home-made, yet has that restaurant-y flavor. 
They are going to run out of space very soon."}
{"text":"Place is very nice and clean and pretty! Love the way the restaurant looks and feels. Its a relaxing environment that allows you to enjoy lunch or dinner! The hours they open are from 11-3 then reopens at 5-9. The service is wonderful and staff is very friendly. Gotta give them some slack these first few weeks as they are learning and coordinating their routine but overall they are  doing great. Will come again! Try the coconut ice cream!!!"}
{"text":"Phuket Thai is an awesome little restaurant. They have great customer service and the food is always delicious. I've had quite a few dishes on their menu and they are always delicious. I'm so glad this place is near my work! :)"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a happy hour for a networking group and it was soooo delicious. Papaya salad, soup and a noodle dish that was so yummy. We will definitely be back! Service was great and you get 10% off if you pay cash."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, exceptional service, and just a wonderful restaurant all around! The restaurant was very clean and tastefully decorated. Will definitely be back. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great little place!  Pay cash for 10% off.  I HIGHLY recommend their drunken noodles!  The beef ones were delicious!!!  We will be back!  Yummy!!!!  My only complaint is the portions are way too small for the price!"}
{"text":"This place was good.  Not great, but good.  The spice levels were all over the place.  The meals I ordered as a \"2\" on the 1-4 spice range were spicier than the ones I ordered as a 3 and a 4.  I pretty much always get the Pad See Ew.  It was a bit dry.  I prefer a saucier Pad See Ew.  The flavor was decent, but the \"3\" spice level tasted more like a 1 or 2.  My boyfriend had eaten there before....inside the restaurant.  He always gets his as spicy as they make it.  He said when he ate at the restaurant it was so hot he was sweating and drinking a ton of water.  His food this time didn't taste spicy at all.  He was disappointed because he's all about the heat.  I'll definitely give it another chance though.  Service was good.  We had to wait a few minutes for our order, but everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"We've finally found our new Thai spot!  The atmosphere is nice, good music, comfortable chairs and very clean.  The food is fantastic.  I started with the tom yum soup and I was thrilled. Spicy with lots of veggies.  The veggie rolls were quite good too our entrees were the beef and broccoli in a spicy brown sauce.  It was delicious and the aftertaste was even better.  I had the pad Thai and fell in love.  Thank you for the wonderful dinner and super friendly service.  We will be back again...and again."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service. No, they do not thaw their meat outside. This is a first class operation. You don't want to pass this one by."}
{"text":"Sadly wanted to support a local business and Thai food is one of my weak points in the area. Had high hopes but this place let me down. Ordered the Pad Thai to go with mild spicy choice.

It wasn't so much the spiciness that I had an issue with, it was the lack of flavor...that's all I can really say sadly. The price was ok for the lunch special but will most likely not return due to the lack of flavor...

Time to move on and hope for another Thai restaurant to open up in the area..."}
{"text":"10% off for paying with cash.  I wanted to start with that before you stop reading.  :)

We ordered a few dishes to try and were happy with what we got.  Another reviewer said the spice levels were all over the place and they were right.  We ordered medium spice and it hardly had any kick to it.  

We are huge fans of all types of Asian cuisine.  The flavors were good, the atmosphere was clean and decorated nicely.   The staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We've eaten here the night they opened and thought it was quite good! Our second visit here was more recent and it was just as good as the first time! This is in our neighborhood so we're always glad to try a new place and support a local business too.

I think the first time we ordered pad see ew and a beef dish, this time we got pad Thai, fried rice and a chicken curry dish. Very tasty, fresh and generous but not oversized portions!

We look forward to returning again very soon!

{"text":"We loved the food. Great experience nice, atmosphere and good service what can I say, been there 2 x in one week. Will be back soon. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This may be a little Americanized Thai, but it is great. Every 2 weeks or so, my family and I call in a huge order to pickup. We are always greeted with a friendly smile, and good service. They also have ALWAYS gotten our order right. I love all the food I have tried (especially the seasonal mango sticky rice!) So glad this place is so close to home. Can't wait until the next time I stop in!!!"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was delicious! Definitely the best we've had in the valley, possibly the best we've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Saw this place open up awhile back and finally decide to give it a try, my favorite is the Cashew Chicken but the Pad Thai and Chicken Noodles are pretty good also.  The lunch special includes a small salad, and so far the spice level (2 & 3) has been very consistent.  Plus they show the dishes on their TV screens so you can see it before you eat it. Yes there are better Thai places in town, but it's very convenient and is now part of our lunch rotation so every other week we go there, been there at least 6x times now and the staff & service have always been good!"}
{"text":"First time here:

Ordered for pickup at 7:31pm on a Saturday. Was told it'd be ready in twenty minutes. Got there at 8:14pm; while paying, I was told it'd be another 15 minutes.  There was no explanation as to why I was waiting, just that it'd be longer.

I took a seat at the bar top while I waited. One positive thing I can say is the guy at the front did offer me a beverage while I waited. Now, I could have possibly understood the additional time if the place were busy. But, there were 2 tables with maybe 4 people dining at them. Didn't seem busy either when I noticed a female & two male employees standing in the doorway of the kitchen talking. 

As I was observing the restaurant another man walked in to pick up his order. They told him it'd be another thirty minutes- he proceeded to raise his voice & advised the manager he had already been told 40 mins when he placed the order. This was NOT a very good first impression.

It started getting to be 8:30 & still no food. I had even reached out to my boyfriend & we contemplated getting a refund and getting In & Out instead. After about five more minutes the manager brought me my food and said \"sorry for the wait, we had to remake everything\" and walked off. 

Aside from the atrocious service, the food wasn't worth waiting an hour for. It wasn't terrible but definitely have had better quality. We ordered the Spicy Fried Rice (level 2) with chicken & Pad Thai (level 2) with chicken & shrimp. The egg rolls were also decent. 

On the fence about returning."}
{"text":"This is my moms favorite thai food place and she swore there was no better thai food she's ever had. I was skeptical, but we got tom kha, shrimp pineapple curry and of course classic pad thai. The tom kha is served with a heater that comes to the table. It was addicting and I was sad when it was gone. The pad thai has excellent flavor and since I've started to try to make it at home I've been paying extra attention to the sauce. It's the perfect thickness to coat each noodle. The service was great. Sadly we didn't have room for dessert, but will be back."}
{"text":"Had a nice vegetarian lunch here yesterday for $7.99. Deep fried Tofu and vegetables with a light brown sauce , a small plate of lettuce only with peanut dressing and a miniature egg roll which I did not eat. The vegetables came with a lovely white jasmine rice. 
I liked it very much and finished everything sans the egg roll . 
The service was very good and the atmosphere unobtrusive . I will definitely return and bring others.  I hope they do well because the food seems healthy and.... what do you know...tastes good too!
Phuket Thai Cuisine has made its way onto the short list of places I will eat.
Most notable and worth sharing is I actually felt great after the meal. Often after dining out the salt and other additives restaurants use have an adverse effect on me so my list of possibilities is a short one .
I sure hope they keep up the present standards of food quality and customer care."}
{"text":"Stopped in and had their pad Thai along with some Thai tea. Everything was very good and very fresh. It's a little on the lighter side, which was refreshing. Their coconut ice cream is amazing. 10/10 for Thai food in the area."}
{"text":"The Thai food here can't be beat! Always cooked to perfection and we are never disappointed. Sometimes service is a little slower when they are busy but always worth the wait. Try the Panang Curry. Love."}
{"text":"Delicious food, clean restaurant, very friendly staff.  We have been eating her regularly (as in 2x/week) and love it.  My son was always a huge fan of another place until he tried my pineapple rice and now he orders it twice a week.  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST Thai food I've ever had. Nicest employees, super understanding of modifications, and at amazing prices. You NEED to come!!"}
{"text":"I agree with previous reviews that this is the best Thai restaurant in the area.  The food is pretty authentic.  If you're looking for something special don't be afraid to ask.  They made me something off the menu (deep fried pompano with curry sauce) and it was exactly what I wanted!"}
{"text":"Did a double date dinner with friends and was very impressed. Probably the nicest Thai food we have had since leaving Australia 2.5yrs ago. Have been to few Thai places that 'get it right' and have a true authentic cuisine. We all said we would be back - very soon!!"}
{"text":"Went looking for a new Thai restaurant cause we didn't have the kids so we decided on this place.  We walked in and ordered take out.

An order of Pad Thai and Panang Curry to go.  Decent size place and it was busy cause it was dinner time.  Even though we ordered to go, the waitress still gave us waters.  Still summer in the AZ.  Order was ordered fairly quick.  Didn't seem more than 10 minutes.  

The food was very tasty but a little pricey for me.  It seemed like he Panang Curry could used a little more meat.  We even ordered chicken and added shrimp.  The Pad Thai was also chicken and shrimp.  Counted 2 shrimp and thinky shaved chicken pieces.  I like the touch of cabbage for a different texture and the heat was just right.  I ordered level 1 for heat cause my wife was having some but it was still hot for me.

I think this is a good place and maybe it is a bigger serving if we eat there.  We will try this place again."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great service and a clean establishment that is consistent in the best Thai food you can find in the east valley!"}
{"text":"Small and unassuming....BEST Panang in the Valley!! Consistently good and fresh and quality beef! I haven't tried anything else cause I am just in love with the Panang!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Tried a few of the apps and we were not wow. Would not recommend the fish cakes unless you are a die hard fan of them. They are an acquired taste for sure!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot on Friday night. We were seated right away and the service was great. I ordered my old stand-by, Pad See Ew, and was very pleased. They were generous with the tofu and the veggies, which I appreciated. Delicious food and fair prices, what more can we ask for?

I got sticky rice for dessert, and it was expensive for what it was. I'll skip it next time and go out for ice cream instead.

The ambiance was nice, a bit on the casual side. It would be good for a 3rd or 4th date, but maybe not a first date. :-)"}
{"text":"We ordered shrimp Tom Yum soup and it's really good and they are generous with the veggies. Also the drunken noodles is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food selection, good price, friendly service & yummy.  Great lunch menu and delicious ginger tea."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this restaurant at least two times before this last one. The food is excellent and the service was good. We met two of our friends for dinner on Thursday evening and what a fiasco. The orders were taken;  but everything arrived at different times. The appetizers came first and on time and were delicious. Then One person in the party got their salad which was their dinner entrée. Her husband got his about 15 minutes later. And in the meantime, my husband and I had nothing. We waited at least a half hour and tried to get the attention of the personnel but to no avail. There were parties around us that arrived after us and were served before us. A lady came out of the kitchen and said you haven't gotten two of your entrées right? We were at that point ready to leave. However, she insisted that we take our entrées.  Mine came first and then 10 minutes later came my husbands. By that time, he was no longer hungry and requested a take-home box. We then had to wait another bit of time for the check to arrive. No compensation or explanation was given other then \"we were very busy tonight\". 
This is inexcusable, as there were obviously a problem with coordinating the food in the back. We will not be returning to eat at this restaurant despite the good food."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood Thai restaurant.  I had the red curry pork with brown rice Thai hot and it was really good.  My wife had one of the noodle bowls with meatballs and that was really good, too.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in the valley! The owner always remembers my name and staff is always friendly"}
{"text":"We had lunch here today, party of 2. The restaurant atmosphere was nice, decoration and cleanliness were a thumbs up. I observed a lot of new clients trying the place out. Service was lacking though, observed 2 party's leaving just because of the wait and lack of service. Though keep in mine we got seated and our service was good and attentive.

Food we ordered: Pad Thai, Panang Curry Beef, and Tom Kha Gai Soup. Unfortunately the Pad Thai had to much sauce. The dish was thick and gummy and bland. The Panang Curry was just as bland, the curry sauce was like soup that didn't stick to the meat. The Tom Kha Gai Soup was tasty but was lacking a slight thickness that curry milk adds. We were so excited for a local thai restaurant and unfortunately left so disappointed. In addition to another \"Yelp review\" our 3 dishes for lunch $30 which in agreeance is high for the dishes we ordered.

I'm sorry to say we will not be coming back, which is really sad as we need some good local flavors."}
{"text":"Great customer service and the best flavor ever!  I would recommend the Tom Nak Soup with coconut milk.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, good food, great homemade coconut ice cream.  Our lunch was super!  The staff was great, the place is clean.  They give you 10% discount if you pay with cash."}
{"text":"Tried my standard comparison dish here- yellow curry with chicken.  The lunch came with a small salad with peanut dressing, a mini egg roll, rice.    The curry had nice flavor ( I went with 3 of 4 stars for heat).  It was pretty standard with onions, green pepper, potatoes.   Unfortunately the potatoes were just short of fully cooked.  They weren't raw but they were somewhere in between."}
{"text":"Wonderful food with lots of choices for spicy and non-spicy food. Great Service and good atmosphere. Worth coming in and definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place.   Food is superb, especially the soups.  Service is friendly and personable.   Will be back there as soon as I get back to AZ."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the east valley. First time there. Had Tom Kha and Pad  Ki Mew. Both were terrific. 
Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Thai place! Great service, we like to order for pick up as well. All of the curry dishes are delicious. Priced affordably and nice atmosphere for dining in as well."}
{"text":"This place is terrific. Staff is super friendly and food is delicious! Restraint is clean. We always get takeout though."}
{"text":"Back in 2015, posted a 4 star review, but now Sept 2016 updating my review to a 1 star.  When we first starting coming here, the food and staff were great, particularly their TOM KHA, which I have ordered many times as well as their various curries and chicken noodles.  Then, the wait staff began to turn over and the service has been terrible on multiple occasions but we dismissed the bad service due to the food being good...our last three times including last night (tried to give them multiple chances b/c how does a place who previously had wonderful food and service all of a sudden do a 180?), the food has been terrible,  not at all what we had experienced previously.  Not sure if the cook has changed but orders are coming out without all the ingredients listed on the menu and the flavors have completely changed on their dishes.  When our waitress noticed I didn't eat any of my soup and declined a to-go container for it, I mentioned to our waitress that the soup I ordered was not at all what they had been serving previously and our other dish didn't have key ingredients in it, she just shrugged like \"who cares?\" and brought us our bill.  What a shame, this place used to be one of our favorite lunch spots which we frequented weekly,  but after 3 consecutive bad experiences, we will never go back"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this little restaurant was.  I was trying to find a Thai restaurant in Chandler that was open for lunch, I normally go to True Silk Asian but they're closed on Saturdays at lunch so I decided to try this place instead based on the yelp reviews. 
I live past Casa Grande and we are definitely restaurant challenged when it comes to diversity of cuisine in our area. I ordered they're delicious chai milk tea which  very flavorful, then I had a half a bowl of their Tomkha  coconut soup, it came in a large bowl that was heated with a little candle so the soup stayed hot, I thought it was quite delicious and had wonderful flavor. I chose the lunch menu so it included a small salad with ginger dressing and then I had the pad ka prow chicken and vegetables. They asked me how spicy I wanted it from 1 to 4 and I said make it a 1 an it was still pretty hot, however very tasty. It's served with a small egg roll, rice and for dessert a little cup of coconut ice cream which was excellent.  The restaurant appears to be very clean,  I observed them really wiping down all their tables extremely well after people left and they kept my table cleared as I was dining.  I thought the service was very good and very friendly and I told them I wish they come down to Casa Grande as we need a Thai restaurant in our town!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite Thai food, but definitely convenient and good enough for Thai that I don't need to drive 30 minutes to get to.  The Pad Thai has a pretty mild flavor and the ingredients blend well together.  The curries seem a bit too sweet.  Also if you get it spicy, the heat doesn't seem to blend well with the sweet.  In other words, the sweetness of the curries overpowers the spiciness.  That being said, it's still pretty good.  And convenient."}
{"text":"We came here bc pho chandler across the street was full along with a waiting line.. and it was cold to wait outside .. I guess we had the same idea is everyone else to come eat pho since it was cold but decided to come eat Thai instead.. The food here is good but the service is slow!!! The restaurant is not that big and the restaurant was about 3/4 full with only two waitresses it looked like.. they need to hire another person but other then that we enjoyed our meal.."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews often but I feel after tonight's experience I had to. We have eaten here before and the food is good.  Tonight we ordered carry out and my husband went to get it and waited over 50 minutes. When he asked what was taking so long, the staff walked right past him and ignored him. If that's how you treat your customers then we are no longer dining here.  I went back and read several reviews and apparently we are not the only ones who experienced this kind of treatment."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood restaurant with very good food and friendly staff.  Have eaten here several times and gotten takeout and haven't had a bad dish yet.  All of the curries are good and the spice level 4 has a nice kick to it."}
{"text":"From beginning to end, we loved every minute of this restaurant!  The Decor is beautiful yet unpretentious and inviting. Every dish we had was full of flavor and generously portioned. 
To top it all off we got to spend quite a bit of time chatting with Woody, the Thai owner, who is simply delightful! 
South Chandler is fortunate to have this family owned gem in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great food every time. Pretty consistent flavor and quality. I Love their pad garlic, coconut princess and chicken noodles. 
Also service tends to be slow although they are super nice but I wish they'd hire one more server. It can get Super slow sometimes."}
{"text":"Great little resteraunt with good food.  On the quiet side but still nice. No liquor so no sing ha beer. Service a little slow but very polite. Recommend highly."}
{"text":"Used to be 5 stars for quality and price but since one of the waitresses left, Benjakoon (spelling) just not the same. Wait staff does not seem to understand english well and never get the orders just right anymore."}
{"text":"Wow this place really fell off.

The pad Thai was sweet and really dry. Pad Thai is not something I would usually order but it supposed to be good here. It basically tasted like noodles in a tomato sauce. Not good!

Then we ordered a Basil Chicken (Gra Prao) Thai style and they didn't understand we wanted it ground and with a fried egg. It came out just ok but had such a small amount of chicken everyone made comments about it. Lots of veggies, no real meat. Bad dish for that type of thing.

We won't be back. There are better Thai places around."}
{"text":"Totally delicious, ever noodle and rice dish we have tried.  Ambiance is nice and relaxing, servers and service is fantastic.  What's not to Love.  Will repeat and repeat.  Oh that right we're already new regulars.  Can't go wrong good $ value for the quality you receive."}
{"text":"OK, 4th time here and have varied the selection up,, My goto is still the Panang Curry / Chicken.. now imagine this with Crab or even Lobster ..lol,, hmm.. But so far this place is VERY consistent, even with the Spice Levels.. 

Spicy Fried rice might be my next best item here, as this has great flavor, only offset was the full spinach leaves and green beans,, I think they should be dices up a little, but overall Very Nice.. 

I forgot they had the Panang Curry on lunch menu, so I been avoiding this place for a few craving outbreaks,, Now i know n hopefully remember.."}
{"text":"People rave about this restaurants food, little do they know they thaw their meat outside behind the restaurant. This is not the first time, just the first time I was able to get a picture. Board of health will be paying a visit very soon."}
{"text":"This is the cleanest restaurant we have ever visited. We started with the Spicy Angel wings. They were crispy, hot and delicious.. if you don't order these you are missing out. We ordered  two lunch special one with chicken and one with beef both number 2 spice. Both were large portions and cooked to perfection. Phu Ket is a must visit when visiting Chandler Az."}
{"text":"From the parking lot it looks inviting, and the staff were wonderful, the food excellent, just the right combination of spices, fast service, and just in the time period we were there four take-out orders went out the door and five tables were filled!  Excellent.... We will be back!"}
{"text":"It drives me nuts when restaurants close even five minutes before closing time. I find it to be poor customer service. 

I called 20 min before closing time to place my order while on my way there and the lady said it will be ready for pick up in 5 min. Whoa that's fast food! Ok but considering I'm paying $12 for my dish I'd hope they'd put a lil more love into it. 
I get there 5 min before closing and the closed sign is up. :/ 
Worker inside sees me and brings out my order of the Evil Chicken Jungle Princess. On a scale from 1-4 I ask for level 3 spicy. Oh Btw they give you a 10% discount if you pay in cash. 
I get home, open up my bag and am already disappointed. The serving size failed in comparison to other Thai places. The dish did not have enough veggies as it should have. It consisted of mushrooms, chicken some onions and a lot of coconut curry, and it wasn't spicy, not like I had expected from a level below the spiciest. Maybe it's because I'm Mexican. I like it really spicy. 
I'll stick to my favorite, Thai Rama in chandler. They do it right and cost less."}
{"text":"Well-seasoned and delicious dishes abound! We ordered a chicken yellow curry, chicken pad Thai, beef salad and Thai fried rice. We adored every dish and enjoyed how evenly-flavored everything was. I find that many Thai restaurant cooks over-season and sweeten dishes (not their fault as I imagine they're trying to appeal to and cater to the American palette) but Phuket Thai Cuisine did not disappoint. 

The spice level was perfect (I ordered a 1 on a scale of 1-5) - not overwhelmingly spicy or too bland and a lovely middle ground was achieved without sacrificing the subtle flavors of Thai cuisine. 

Lovely variety of selections and delicious! I can't wait to order from them again."}
{"text":"Very happy. Thank you Yelper's for the great call out.

So what the place is buried in a garden variety strip mall. The place is clean inside and decor is minimal. But, all of the people we interacted with were very friendly.

Had the orange chicken and a noodle special with chicken. Both were very elegantly plated. I always err on the side of caution when it comes to Thai spices. I selected a \"2\" out of 0-4. It was very - VERY - mild. I might jump all the way to their \"Thai hot\" 4 next time. Very flavorful, though. Thai iced tea is just yummy in a glass. The server recommended we have their \"home made\" coconut ice cream. It was very tasty.

Great value for the money. Come prepared to pay in cash and you'll save 10%. What a deal!

I'd definitely come back.

There is a long-time Thai restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale that prides itself on its authenticity (who happens to be very defensive about this with Yelp review responses). The owner of this place needs to dine here at Phuket Thai and learn what people who come straight from Phuket do these days with food."}
{"text":"Two times I've gotten take out Pad Thai and it's been amazing both times.  I got it extra spicy the second time (#4). Sooooo good."}
{"text":"I have not eaten in the restaurant, but only done take out.  From what I can tell the owner is really nice, the restaurant is clean and relaxing, and their food is excellent.  I love the pad thai with pan fried tofu.  Their papaya salad is wonderful.  Their sticky rice with mango is delicious.  Now that I am writing this review I think I want Thai food for dinner now.  :-) I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Okay. Whoever said the food had no flavor... Obviously has no taste buds. The food is delicious and I love thai food. I've ordered a multitude of dishes and have been satisfied with them. I get the 3/4 on the spicey scale. The waitresses are very friendly and attentive!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, large portions. We will return another day with friends. We had Pad Thai and yellow curry both very good."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and employees.  I had the Tom Kha soup which was excellent.  My date had the Thai fried rice and loved it."}
{"text":"This restaurant by far has the best tasting Thai food I have had in the U.S.  Freshly cooked to order food.  Perfect seasonings in the dishes ordered paired with friendly neighborhood service.  Family operated."}
{"text":"I think I need to give Phuket another try because it was just okay to me. I came for lunch on a busy weekday and didn't have a lot of time to eat, which is my fault, I should have ordered ahead.   The price was reasonable and the servers were as attentive as they could be given how packed out the place was but my food, drunken noodles w/ mild spice, was just okay. Maybe I'll try to stop in another day or order my food to go next time."}
{"text":"FINALLY, southern chandler has a good Thai restaurant! Great service, good food, very clean.  They have a TV that rolls through pictures of dishes so you can get an idea what you're ordering if you are new to Thai cuisine.  Their spicy scale is juuuuuuust right.  I got 2 out of 4 and it had just enough heat.  They even give a discount for cash pay customers.  My wife and I have been dying for a neighborhood Thai place in the Ocotillo area.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Thai food around.  They are quick and efficient with out compromising the quality of the food. The only thing I'd be careful of (if you're a white wimp like me) is that their spice level is pretty intense.  I get a 2 and I should probably stick to a 1.  My boyfriend looooves the heat so it's not a negative thing... Just a heads up.  We go back all the time. My favorites are the pad Thai, yellow curry, coconut soup, and beef salad.  Everything I try is pretty dang good though. Happy eating..."}
{"text":"I ordered the prik  king and it seemed old like it was sitting there for days and just reheated. The green  beans weren't  fresh and were all shriveled up. Very disappointed.  My husband's wasn't  very good. We won't  be returning, better off going  to Thai Rama, always fresh!"}
{"text":"Love this family owned and run business. I have been delighted with Curry's and I love the Tom Kha soup. I tried the eggplant special recently and savored every bite. I'm so glad they have a liquor license now, because beer and Thai is perfect combination in my book. Great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in Arizona. 
Came for lunch, they get quite busy. 
Ordered green curry shrimp. Started with small, but very tasty salad. The sweet peanut sauce was a surprise, and delicious.
Curry arrived with side of white rice, and a small crispy spring roll. I asked for medium spice and it was outstanding! The Thai flavors I've missed for years were there. Just the right heat.
Clean, neat little place. Service was ok. They were busy. Got VERY loud with Asian mom's little kids running around and screaming.
Much rowdier than I remember from Thailand.
Nevertheless, we will return, great food!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and lunch was extremely good. The Beef Pad Thai was a large serving with leftovers to enjoy later. The Yellow Curry was enjoyed by my guest and he had leftovers too. Have eaten here 4-5 times since it opened and it is my first choice for Thai food."}
