{"text":"Had the oxtail pho.... if you're expecting an authentic Viet experience, you won't get it here. Noodles weren't as fresh as other pho places, broth was decent, but oxtail was quite fatty. Spring rolls were good. And service wasn't great...I probably wouldn't come back even though the decor and atmosphere are decent."}
{"text":"Buyer beware!
We were looking for authentic Pho after a round of golf nearby and when we saw the restaurant sign we thought we got lucky finding a Pho place at this remote location.
This is really a Chinese restaurant trying to serve Pho and Thai food.
Very disappointed.
Why call yourself Pho Mi while serving Chinese food??
The only good thing about this restaurant is the price of beer: $2.50 even for a bottle of imported Heineken ."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving it a 2 as the service was great, and the decor is actually pretty classy for a pho joint.

Unfortunately, the pho itself was pretty average. Better than Pho 88 in Oakville, but nowhere near the places I went to in Vancouver and a few in TO.

- only comes in one pretty large size. Not ideal for dates, or when you just want a quick bite.

- broth was fresh, but meat was only so-so

- No red/black sauce to mix. One of my favourire features of pho joints is adding sauces to make my own dish"}
{"text":"Decent Vietnamese/Thai restaurant in Oakville. There's not many spots in Oakville to get Pho (period!) but it makes for an nice option. The decor/ambiance is very nice and relaxing and the food is overall pretty good. We ordered a variety of things: Siagon Pho, Shrimp & Chicken golden curry, Ginger chicken, and Lemon chicken. Ive had better pho for a cheaper price elsewhere in Oakville but it was still good. Overall, it's not the BEST Thai or Vietnamese food you've ever had in your life but it is pretty good and they have a good variety of different dishes. The staff (and manager especially) is VERY friendly and eager to help you order if you're new to the world of Vietnamese food. If you're not a professional Asian food critic (or a pho snob) then you'll love this place :)"}
{"text":"This used to be Orchid Thai Fusion.  The buffet is gone but the food is the same.  Whatever they served before they now serve as individual dishes.  If you loved Thai Fusion food before than you will still love it becuase the name may have changed but the food and atmoshphere are still the same.  This is not just a Pho like the new restaurant name they changed to but it is still an asian fusion.  There are Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese dishes.  All the food is made fresh and tasty.  I was a regular before the change and will continue to come back. They also have some good lunch and dinner combos."}
{"text":"Average Pho and slow service brought down the rating. On a positive note...great spring rolls."}
