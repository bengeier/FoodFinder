{"text":"I have often passed the Crumbles Bakery on the TTC and wanted to give it a try but I either never had the time or it was closed. It is a combination bakery/deli with seats in the back. Today I finally made it in and I am writing this as a heads up to any potential customers. I only had one item, apple strudel and to be honest it was pretty good and the lady who served me was lovely. However, I am writing this to warn other potential customers of their astronomically inflated prices. The strudel is not precut so you choose the size you want, The size I chose was not huge, just a regular sized serving which I was taking out. I paid 4.75 for a piece of average tasting and average sized take out strudel!  You would pay this much downtown at a sit in cafe so I am really unsure of how the cost is justified at this location. So the moral of the story is ask the price before you buy. Based on taste I would give it a 3 and based on value for money I would give it a 2 so that averages to a 2.5 but yelp doesn't give half stars."}

{"text":"Made the mistake of paying $9 for two stale cookies and a meh butter tart. Absolutely ridiculous prices for the poor quality baked goods they offer.

Cash only on top of all the other issues this place has."}
