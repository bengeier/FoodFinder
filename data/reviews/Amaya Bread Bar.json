{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best Indian food in Toronto.  The biggest thing I find, is that the ingredients are really high quality.  The meat, especially is high grade.  

The saag paneer and butter chicken are my favorites from Amaya.  They used to have a potato pastry appetizer that was to die for but no longer offer it unfortunately."}
{"text":"I loved Amaya! Went last week with a few friends and the waiter was really great about explaining the dishes, making suggestions and was very personable. 

Ordered two types of naan, rice, three curries - chicken, lamb and beef as well another dish with shrimp and it was all fantastic. They are really creative with their naan! 

The staff was great and the food is incredible! The waiter mentioned there is a smaller Amaya restaurant near Yorkville which I am looking forward to trying as its a bit closer. I will absolutely go back to this location!"}
{"text":"I used to always order delivery from Amaya Express, but I finally made the effort to go to the restaurant. The service was great and the food was delicious (LOVE their butter chicken). I was a bit surprised by the restaurant's layout but it had a nice atmosphere. The only thing I wasn't mad about was the mango lassi. Theirs was a bit more juicy, while I usually like it to be more heavy on the yogurt side.

We had the saag panneer (yum!), shrimp curry (ok) and a couple of us had the gourmet taste platter which had a nice range of things to try.

I'll definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place....... The food taste like tomato sauce.... Order tasting menus.... bread was stone cold!! Appetizers were not good either. It is no way near to Indian food. They have modified everything to suit Canadian palate. Indian food should be spice not sweet. Totally disappointed. Food was dull and boring...."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Indian restaurant in the city. 

Some people find it a little toned down, but I really enjoy the subtlety the food here has. We ordered the saag paneer, chicken vindaloo, which was pretty spicy, but in a good way, and prawns in this slightly sweet coconut curry. Everything was amazing.

Service is good, but it feels a little snobby, especially when I came in with a Groupon. 

P.S. They have one of the better winterlicious/summerlicious menus I have tried, portion sizes are great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend always suggests Indian food and I always turn it down since I always leave an Indian restaurant feeling 5 pounds heavier. I'm glad I didn't turn down his suggestion this evening... definitely worth the extra pounds!

We started with the Chandi Platter - with a vegetable samosa, pakoras & onion bhajia ($9). The samosa was one of the best I've ever had! As for the pakoras and bhajia, I had no clue what these were. I think I was daydreaming when the server explained to us what these were. All I caught was the tail end of his sentence when he assured me they were delicious. And just like that I was sold (not difficult when I'm starving)! The server was right - the onion bhajia was amazing. It was like a fried onion fritter. As for the pakora, they were like a chickpea (I think) fritter, which sadly wasn't as good. Found it a little dry and crumbly.

We also ordered the butter chicken ($15). It contained large chunks of chicken - white meat. Although I prefer dark meat, the chicken wasn't too dry.. the amazing sauce really helped. It tasted especially amazing with the garlic naan ($3.5), which is a MUST order. Delish!

The second entree we ordered was the Coastal Prawn Curry - with coconut milk, tamarind, mustard seeds & curry leaves ($19). Not quite as good as the butter chicken, but still decent. Slightly sweet curry with a bit of a kick to it.

We also got an order of the Saffron basmati ($4). Tasted like plain rice to me. I'd skip the rice and just get the garlic naan.

Overall, I had a pretty good experience at Amaya. Sure, the prices are a little on the high side - the bill for two of us came to nearly $60 before tips, but given the great food (for the most part) and the upscale, intimate ambiance, I feel it's justified. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food in Toronto, you just have to know what to get.  If you are there on a date, and I sincerely hope you are, get the chef's taster menu for around $45 a head... it's a delightful romp through traditional and inventive fusion dishes, it's quality food and in a perfect quantity.  

If you don't want a personal, guided tour from the chef, then I suggest the biryani, the butter chicken or the saag paneer.  Their naan is small, light, fluffy and absolutely amazing when fresh out of the tandoor.  The chutneys and pickles are out of this world, and served with fresh, crisp pappadums.

This is not traditional Indian food, the chicken is boneless (everyone loves a chicken-spine in their vindaloo once in a while right?)... but still quite excellent. The biryani at Amaya is one of the best rice dishes I've ever had, but it's not a biryani in the traditional sense.  You must try the mango lassi, it's also phenomenal.

You can't leave here without spending a fair bit of money, but the food is unique, well prepared and delicious."}
{"text":"Nice location, nice ambience, but mediocre food and service.

And a very limited menu for vegetarian diners.  Quite surprising considering the location and the times."}
{"text":"Amaya Bread Bar claims to serve \"neo-Indian\" cuisine but in my view that really means toned-down Indian food for the \"Canadian palate.\"
The fare was decent but it really could have been more flavourful. It was really lacking that extra something that makes me want to go back to a restaurant again.
I also must say the prices are a little high for the amount of food served. 
I went there on a fairly busy night and five of us got crammed into a small 4 seater. I wasn't the best seating arrangement.
That being said, the management and staff are nice, even if our server was a tad clueless about some of the ingredients on the menu.

Not likely to return unless invited there for aspecial occasion."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend to experience Indian cuisine, and it was amazing.

Although my stomach couldn't handle the taste of western asia, and I nearly died for that weekend feeling full all the time from oil, I overestimated myself greatly in term of being able to eat. 
We got butter chicken, some curry dish and an appetizer of fried chicken? We ordered too much naan and one dish + sliders would've been enough but regardless food was VERY good, and if you're looking for a great Indian place in Willowdale definitely come here. Reasonably priced 15$ for main courses. 

Would come here again."}
{"text":"One of 3 Amaya locations in north Toronto, Amaya Bread Bar offers take-out and local delivery (on orders over $30) in addition to a beautiful dine-in facility. 

The food is great; as the name suggests you owe it to yourself to try a couple varieties of the naan. But if you're a big fan of spicy food you'll notice that Amaya tones down some of the traditionally super hot dishes -- the vindaloo is delicious, but certainly won't set your tongue on fire. Our waiter was friendly and offered helpful information and suggestions for my companion's dainty palate. 

The dining room features some separate tables, and some long tables with dividers at which you sit next to strangers. The dividers offer some privacy, but be prepared to bump elbows with your neighbor as there isn't much space between seats. Consider calling ahead for a reservation if you have your heart set on a private table.

You're paying as much for the ambiance as you are for the food, so unless you're on a date or going out for a special occasion there are better values in the neighborhood. But if you're a local and you're in the mood for some tasty Indian food, the take-out prices are reasonable and the portions large enough that you'll probably have enough leftovers for another full meal."}
{"text":"Things that are more likely to happen than me ever ordering from Amaya again:

1. A dog becomes president of the United States.
2. The Leafs win the Stanley Cup
3. I grow a beard and die.

The food is decent but after the experience I had tonight there is no chance I will ever be ordering from Amaya again.  We frequently get takeout to be delivered.  After TWO HOURS we finally got our food.  At no point did we get any sort of notification that our food would be late, we had to call to find out the status of our order at which point we were informed that the driver had run into traffic.  Really?  We live about a 10 minute drive away and ordered in the evening when the roads are completely clear.  Besides that, I could literally walk to their location and back faster than it took for me to get my food tonight.

Pros: 
-Food is okay
-They're pretty close to where I live

Cons: 
-Inhumanely slow delivery.  As in, I think they've actually employed sloths to cook and deliver their food.
-Horrible customer service.  If my order was going to be late, let me know maybe so I can eat some crackers in the meantime to prevent my stomach from digesting itself while I wait?
-They make up excuses to justify a terrible customer experience."}
{"text":"Worn out after several days' vacation and a stop at the science museum, we found Amaya perked us right up.

The atmosphere was invitingly dark and quiet, and everything was masterfully prepared, from non-alcoholic drinks to letter-perfect pekora amuse-bouches to entrees to naan bread.  I love me some naan!  My wife delighted in the curried prawn.  I'm not proud to admit I ordered butter chicken, but I did, and it was excellent: you can taste the heirloom tomatoes, unlike the canned paste most restaurants use.

This is what fusion cooking should be: inventive and flavorful, not a sacrifice to fru-fru presentation."}
{"text":"Pretty good. 

Good service, very clean restaurant. The best thing we ordered was the Amaya Prawn appetizer. Delicious flavour and the prawns cooked to perfection. Great value. 

Butter chicken has great flavour and chicken was really tender and juicy, but the dish overall was a little bit on the sweet side. Saag paneer was good. Loved the garlic naan... Super garlicky and fragrant. 

Overall a good experience. Would I come back? Maybe. Is there better Indian out there? Of course. It was good but nothing stellar to write home about."}
{"text":"I love Indian food but always have the financial debate of should I really pay 50.00 for what would be 30.00 at the lunch buffet.  But when its cold and damp my body just cries out for some spice and heat. I recently took the dive and ordered from Amaya and I will say that it was very very good.  Just the right spice, heat and soooo tasty.  I had Saag Paneer, Butter Chicken and Beef Vinadloo.  The price was reasonable for the \"Dinner to Share\" and the delivery person was friendly and polite.  I would say that the dishes could use a few more pieces of meat in all that sauce but it was good none the less.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for Indian in the area."}
{"text":"Opted for the winterlicious menu. The food was fabulous but the service was meh. Not terrible nor great. I felt a bit snubbed because I opted to just drink water with lemon. The butter chicken was fabulous. Repeat: yes"}
{"text":"We've had other Amaya experiences before and they were good, but this one... we won't be returning to.

We used our Groupon, but the food was far from any other Indian we've been to, and that's a lot.

Service: 4/5
Food: 1/5

Our neighbouring table ordered after us, but they got their mains before we got our appetizers.  That's not the reason why we soured on the place.

Appetizer had a very very over salted salad. So much so that we couldn't eat it.

Mains:
Butter chicken - very salty as well.
Beef masala - ok, nothing noteworthy.
Saag paneer - the weakest flavoured one I've ever had.  Hands down.
Dal makani - had a taste & texture like baked beans.

Their saving grace was when I spilled some of the saag and the servers got me napkins and soda water very quickly."}
{"text":"Went here for a night dinner. When we walked in there was no body there for at least 10 minutes to sit us. But after that, we were given a choice of two rooms to sit. One of the rooms was relatively cold, and decided to move to the other one, where it seemed to be warmer. The place seems fairly clean, and the waiter was nice and enthusiastic. We ordered the dinner for two, which included an appetizer, which was a paneer and samosa. It was delicious, especially the samosa. We then ordered the butter chicken,  chicken madras and some other dish I don't recall; tofu with spinach is what I remember. The butter chicken and chicken madras were great. No complaints about the quality of the food either, including a very good na'an and rice. We were full, and had a good time. The desert, which I never order, but came with the dinner, was not really that good, but I never liked that cheese ball with honey anyways."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for the tasting menu and we were in heaven.  It was a terrific mix of all their best dishes.  Several days later, I am still craving the short ribs, the lamb lollipops, the lamb kebobs and the casava fries.  

The serving staff was a sweet bunch.  Very attentive and a happy attitude. 
I can't wait to come back to the city to enjoy this place again!"}
{"text":"It is great to have a nice indian curry house in this neighbourhood. Food is excellent. Patio is nice in the summer."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian Food in Toronto. Highest of quality ingredients. Very flavorful food. Decent decor. Average service. The food is the reason my wife and I are regulars here...it is truly delicious. Note: Prices are a bit high for the portions served."}
{"text":"My wife took me here over the holiday break as a redo of my birthday. 
The food here is fantastic. The prix fix menu for 2 (at $60) is a huge steal. We were eating the food for two days, so at $30 a person the value is great.

The special came with a 4 item chef's sample platter. Each item was flavourful; A good indication of the meal to come. For mains we had the Butter Chicken, Mutter Paneer and a shrimp curry. The Butter Chicken was the best of the three, which isn't to say the others weren't tasty in their own way.

I forget what I had for dessert, but it was good. Some mild flavoured cottage cheese thing. My wife had the roasted marsh mellow ice cream which is definitely one of the top 3 ice creams I've had.

The service was also great. Our waiter was courteous and very helpful. Definitely give this place a visit."}
{"text":"The food is very good but their reservation system and customer service is poor

If i am going to come with my friends and drop $900 for dinner then please treat me like a human being and take the reservation and return the call

Emails, opentable and answering machines are there for a reason....if you cannot be bothered to return a message then do not be surprised when the customer goes elsewhere and then realizes that the food is just as good, the wine markup is less, and the experience is better somewhere else

I have eaten here at least 30 times with never a thank you

But if i go to a competitor and the chef comes out to say Hello, i am floored that he takes the interest to chat with me

I will let all my social network understand how Amaya has jumped the Shark and is to be avoided because they have exuded arrogance and have forgotten that the customer is to be respected"}
{"text":"We had wonderful service, a complimentary amuse bouche followed by amazing chef's platter for a starter.  

Ordered a rose cardamom lassi - when I drank it I knew something was wrong.  They made it salty instead of sweet!  Not one for sending food back but I asked our server and he not only took care of it graciously, he took it off our bill too!  Didn't see that coming, as he had quickly remedied the situation!  

He also gave wonderful recommendations and the main course was fantastic!

There will be repeat cravings."}
{"text":"Looking for some Indian food in Toronto, I asked the local bartender for a recommendation and go Amaya as her favorite place for na'an and curry.

After calling to make sure they had availability (she recommended reservations), I high tailed it over there and was quickly seated.

Then waited.

Waited some more.

Aaaaaaaaand nearly got up before the waiter finally came over.

I ordered my staple, the lamb vindaloo and a side of na'an (which I had to pay for - what?!). Can't say the food disappointed, but the service and charge for the bread (which is a staple at all other places I dine) left me wanting.

Not sure I'll be back here - maybe the bartender liked it for delivery."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I brought the $40 groupon to try this restaurant. We asked at least 4 waiters if we can order, but they kept saying that the person who is taking the order is busy. So, we waited for 20 mins before someone can actually take our order. From what we've observed, it seemed that only 1 person in the store can take orders, and that person is the store manager. Their way of doing things were not very efficient. We ordered the Butter Chicken, and it was too sweet. We ordered the Amaya Korma, it was ok, and the appetizer platter.for 2 ($16 Over Price with the amount of food given), and 2 types of Naan. When we got the bill, it was $52. then they added 17% gratuity for 2 people, and on top of that they add 13% tax to calculate the final total. Finally total was $70. That was pretty rip off. At the end, we talk with the manager of the store, and asking this is not right. He kept on making excuses that he cannot change the system as it was preset. After few minutes of arguments, the manager allowed us to a little less. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"I have visited this location a few times and I like it best among all the other Amaya restaurants in the city.

I think they have brought down their prices a bit. The food is always presented well and flavourful but this time it was too salty for my taste. We had the following dishes.

1. Eggplant fritters - They always offer you something complementary, which is a nice surprise to start off the meal :). The fritter were crunchy and were complimented with some vibrant and tasty chutneys (mango, mint and tamarind).

2. Mixed grill for 2 - This is basically a kebab platter chicken tikka, sheekh kebab and tandoori prawns. I was really looking forward to the prawns but they were substituted with malai chicken kebab which was pretty good too. I liked the sheekh kebab the best as the rest of the meat was a bit dry. They served the kebab platter with a refreshing side of salad and pickled onions.

3. Biryani - You can't write a review for an Indian restaurant without tasting their biryani. It is a dish which is hard to master and involves a lot of work. The rice was quite aromatic but was a bit mushy. We also got a complimentary cucumber raita with it which toned down the spices quite well. 

4. Chicken Mughlai Korma - Rich and creamy. It was also very fragrant. It's a shame that the chicken was a bit dry and overcooked. At least that proves that they use white meat here :P. 

5. Garlic Naan - Full of flavour, so good I could eat it all alone!!

Service was great. Everything came on time...it was like a well-oiled machine. We got our complimentary starters then our kebab platter. After we were done they were prompt in changing out plates and serving main course.

The food was very filling and plentiful. We got 1 huge app, 2 mains and sides for $50 plus tax and had enough leftovers for 2 more meals!

Overall these are my ratings.
Food- 3 stars because of the amount of salt.
Service - 4 stars. The waiters are always courteous, professional and were glad to get my feedback about the salty food.
Ambiance - 3.5 stars. I would recommend you to sit at the front of the restaurant. We were seated closer to the kitchen and they seriously need to get some doors installed there. It can get quite noisy. All the other times I have sat in the front room and it has been pretty quiet."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner during Summerlicious. The food was great but there is a huge problem with their customer service. We felt unwelcome as soon as we entered the restaurant. The servers left us waiting at the door awkwardly for much too long, and their reservation system was flawed. 

We ordered the stir-fried calamari and punjabi spiced cod as appetizers and the butter chicken and braised lamb xacutti for our main courses. We hadn't decided on dessert yet and told the waiter that we would decide when he came back after our main course. When the appetizers came, the server dropped half of the food onto our table, which is why I didn't bother taking a picture. He apologized, but then simply left and didn't do anything else for us. However, the appetizers were good and well-spiced. Totally loved the calamari.

Main courses came with a side of rice and were absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend the butter chicken to anyone who chooses to come here.

Our main courses were taken away very quickly and we weren't given a chance to order dessert. We waited for about 15 minutes, thinking he would come back, but it turns out he forgot and thought we were waiting for the bill. A different server passed by our table and gave us a look and said something along the lines of \"what do you want?\" Hmm, how about service that matches your food? He took our dessert order, but out of the three dessert options on the Summerlicious menu, they said they were out of everything except Gulab Jamun. We were disappointed because it wasn't our first choice but it wasn't bad. Extremely sweet, but I think that's just the nature of the dessert.

Overall, Amaya produces quality Indian cuisine, but is wickedly disappointed by its front of house staff."}
{"text":"Despite being an Indian place, there wasn't much on the menu for vegans. Actually, there may not have been anything at all, but we were afraid to ask and end up being starved. We ordered the few vegetable dishes that did not specifically say it had butter or cheese and which are usually vegan at other places. They were ok in flavor, but all were exactly the same color, which was a bit depressing.  When I make the same dishes at home, I end up with a completely different result."}
{"text":"This place is very disappointing. Food was extremely over the top salty. They used seasoning with MSG, tons of it!.

Price is not worth it as you can get better quality food at a Indian buffet for like $12. 

Will not recommend this place at all.
washroom was dirty.... the restaurant was old and dated"}
{"text":"the food was delicious, but a little expensive. i found that Mela (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mela-indian-cuisine-toronto) is a very comparable restaurant, with similar menus but cheaper.

the service was great. i really enjoyed how the food was presented. the person who brought out the food explained the spices and ingredients. that made the experience great."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night without a reservation. I go to the Amaya locations on Bayview often, but this was my first time at the Yonge Street location. 

It's chic and sassy. The decor of the restaurant is quite modern with square shaped plates and super, sleek chairs. Waiting staff are all dressed in black and quite professional, which stems from their extensive knowledge of the menu. 

We ordered the lamb vindaloo, butter chicken, bismati rice and garlic naan. The complimentary poppadum was a pleasant surprise. Their vindaloo is so spicy, but so good! The butter chicken is my all time favourite as it's just right with the spices- just thinking about it makes me want to have a bowl of it right now. With rice and naan, you can't really go wrong.

Mentioned in a couple of reviews, the food here is slightly pricey, but I think you're paying for the entire package - fresh and delicious food, service, and the atmosphere.

Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who would find this food on the \"bland\" side...maybe someone with a fire-breathing habit? Anyways, the food here is adequately spiced - which is to say it's pretty much perfect, but then again, I'm no expert in Vindaloo veracity. Came here with Lauren M. on Sunday and enjoyed a quiet dinner on their outdoor patio, which is colourful and unique (compared to the other Indian restos I've visited). 

It was evident throughout our visit that the staff were earnestly trying to please us. The manager gave us a complimentary app, and we were asked numerous times whether or not we were enjoying the food. Afterward the manager asked us to confirm that our visit had been a good one. This is always a great sign, but the bathrooms may have seen better days.

The quality of the food isn't lacking here, and you won't leave hungry (which seems to be the case with the more pricy restos), but the prices are a bit more steep than most other places serving these dishes.  I'd recommend this place for Indian food lovers willing to pay more on a date."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding!   We had the sag paneer, butter chicken, and beef vindaloo. Dinner for 2 special is really like Dinner for 4.  Not too salty compared to other places, like Bombay Bhel."}
{"text":"Winterlicious:

Good ambience, service, and food.

I had Pan-seared Tilapia with sour cream curry which was very tasty. The fish was fresh and juicy to each bite and the curry sauce was divine!

My main was amaya prawns-tiger shrimp in a tangy green mango curry with a hint of coconut. It was good. Butter chicken is also very good and so is the lamb shank. I don't normally like lamb but this one has to be one of the best. All the mains come with rice dish but we also ordered naan bread which by the way was really tasty with the sauce in your mains.

Carrot toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream was awesome as well. I've never tasted such carroty dessert! It was a nice mix of warm carrot mix and cold real-vanilla ice cream.

Winterlicious dinner menu here was $25 which is definitely worth doing.

Wasn't a big fan of mango mohito that I got..maybe i'll try lassi next time."}
{"text":"This is an awesome chain or place. But the bread bar is my fav. Garlic naan with anything I can probably eat 5 of these in one sitting. The service is great and decor is modern compared to the competition."}
{"text":"Given  the way Amaya handled my reservation, I should be giving them 2 stars but all's well that end's well and I am not a vindictive person, so three flickering stars it is for this joint. Instead of A-Ok, I am going with Eh-Ok!

Background: I cancelled my long standing reservations for Mother's Day brunch at another establishment given the inclement weather forecast for this weekend, and instead booked with Amaya which was closer home. I bought a Groupon for the Royal Tasting Menu and at about 12 noon on Saturday I made dinner reservations for the next day, Mother's Day. On Sunday afternoon,  4 hrs before my reservation, I received a call from Amaya's manager saying that he wouldn't honor the  Groupon for my reservation because apparently it is standard operating procedure to not accept Groupons on holidays. Nowhere was it mentioned on the Groupon fine print that you couldn't avail of the offer on specific days. I seethed at the manager's insouciant  announcement and chewed him out. I did feel bad, don't shoot the messenger and all.. Anyways the owner called shortly after and said he would accept the Groupon, but also told me that I should've just assumed that they wouldn't be honoring the offer on specific days. Bollocks. If other Groupon deals explicitly mention the days that offer isn't valid on, and yours doesn't, it implies that your establishment accepts the deal on all days. 

Anyways...

 We were greeted by the owner, which is a non surprise given our telephone conversations, and I have a feeling all the servers knew about the conversation too!

The decor is mod, and I really appreciated the landscape photographs on the walls. Nice selection.

 The Royal Tasting menu can feed an entire village, though not one with Royal pallets.

The appetizers were the standouts of the meal: the chicken tikkas were tender and delicious. The pakodas, samosas and the fish were ok. A little too deep fried, a little too salty. The mango chutney was rad! 
The mango lassi: probably one of the best I've ever had, very smooth and with just a hint of rosewater.
The main course was a disappointing mass of mostly indistinguishable sauces. The chana masala and the lamb rogan josh almost tasted the same, and looked very alike too. The lamb was very tender, so brownies points for that.
The aloo gobhi was a mushy disappointment.
The shrimp coconut curry benefited from the curry leaves and the mustard seeds. The shrimps were jumbo and melted in your mouth.
The vegetarian pulao was quite good: fluffy basmati rice, with a bit of rosewater, but the veggies clearly came from a frozen packet.
The gulab jamun tasted compactly doughy, just like something straight out of a Gits mix box (Gits is the brown version of Betty Crocker cake mix)

The service was great. Our dirty plates were promptly cleared and glasses were always full. The owner stopped by and chatted us up for a bit, which was a nice touch. 

After another meh experience eating Indian food in the city, I think I am going to swear off Indian restaurants in Toronto. I am really bummed that Debu Saha's which served superlative Indian food has closed down.

Anyways, I am going to stick with cuisines I am not intimately familiar with. Like, say Korean Bbq. My Korean friends recoil in horror at the name of Korean Grill House. But like a stupid, loyal mutt, I keep going back because I really enjoy it for a variety of reasons. Ignorance can be bliss. Sometimes."}
{"text":"Nice place! Patio was absolutely lovely in the summer. They have a nice $25 prix fixe dinner menu right now, but we were using a Groupon coupon so we were not allowed to order off that menu.

The food is pricey, but pretty damn tasty and nicely presented. We had a chicken tikka masala, a saag paneer, 2 naans, poppadums and various chutneys. It came to around $60 with tax and tip (no drinks, just water)

The saag paneer was really nice and spicy. The tikka masala was good but pretty standard. Naan was good, but isn't it always!

The restaurant has great decor, lots of bright colours. Very clean and modern, but the washrooms were surprisingly ghetto in comparison to everything else.

Service was fab and the manager popped around a few times to introduce himself and ask if we were enjoying the food.

I probably wouldn't go back because I like my food cheap, but this was a great treat if you don't mind spending a bit extra."}
{"text":"Yum yum in my tum tum!  I ordered the $8.99 Lentil dhal, and a $3.00 combo of fragrant basmati rice plus some garlic naan (which would norm. have cost $1.99 on its own).  A bit spicy, but not too spicy.  Just the right amount.
I wanted something very quick at this late hour of night, and the helpful Amaya Express clerk recommended either the chickpea dhal or lentil one.

The large container fed both myself and my fellow, portions were good!  He asked \"where'd you get this [again]?\"  A good sign from him - if he didn't like it, he wouldn't have asked.  :)

~~~
I would definitely go again.  I'm keen to try their eggplant and tamarind dish.
She said that would take about a good 10 min. to prepare, however.
~~
I'll edit my review after I visit there again.  The only reason I gave 3 stars, is b/c I have but the one dish to base it on.  I'll know better if it seems to be consistently awesome, in the future, and will post so."}
