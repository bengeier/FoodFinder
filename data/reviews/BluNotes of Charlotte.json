{"text":"I was so excited to hear that Charlotte was finally getting a New Orleans style restaurant that played live jazz and blues. I was even more delighted to hear that the head chef would be from now closed, Bite Your Tongue. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed in the food and service (or should I say lack thereof) from Blunotes.

After seeing the article in the Charlotte Observer, we decided to go for Sundays brunch. I'm not a fan of breakfast food, so we purposely went during lunch hours so I can order from the lunch menu, while my boyfriend was looking forward to their signature chicken and waffles, listed on the brunch menu. There was so many things that had gone wrong with my experience, I decided to bullet point them below:

·         Upon arrival, there was tons of staff at the entrance to greet you, but not enough waitresses or cooks.

·         The menus had colored dots next to everything they did NOT have on the menu. They ONLY had omelets and crab cake benedict. They offer a full menu but ONLY had 2 items available during lunch/brunch time.

·         No beignets!? Would've been nice to munch on during our long wait... More on that later...

·         I asked for a hot tea with lemon, the waitress brought me a cup of HOT sweet tea. I was expecting a cup of hot water and a tea bag. You know, tea!

·         When I asked when they start serving lunch, the waitress had to check and told us that they start serving \"around 3\", when the menu clearly states they serve lunch daily from 11-3....

·         We waited...and waited and waited.....It took over an hour and a half to for us to receive our food. Meanwhile tons of people were leaving the restaurant upon hearing there was limited food options available.

·         I guess it was the manager that approached us and asked if we were \"okay\". We told him we've been waiting over an hour and a half for our food. He mumbled something...never apologized and we never saw him again.

·         When I finally received my omelet, (oh they didn't have green peppers) the onions and red peppers were NOT cooked and they apparently only used 1 egg. I never received my biscuit as advertised.

·         The thing that turned us off the most was they use plastic everything. Cups plates...No real silverware. I've never seen a restaurant serve hot grits in a cookout plastic bowl.

 Who goes to a New Orleans style restaurant for an omelet? I expected some hiccups as it was opening weekend, however I was not  expecting the service we received nor the lack of advertised menu options. I will not be going back. There's absolutely no reason to."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the fried oysters and fried catfish is to die for. Good music, Affectual band was playing. Drinks was ok, could have been better. All n All good spot. Will be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place.

Tried to order a lunch delivery order at 12:05. After putting me on hold for too long she comes back and says they don't deliver until after 1:30. WTF

Went there one night for dinner with my wife, they wanted to charge cover, at 6:30, for music we would not be there to hear. I'm not paying cover to eat dinner! WTF

You've got one more chance, if you're around long enough!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday to have dinner.  When we ordered the waitress came back to tell us that they wouldn't cook what we ordered because the considered it to be lunch time. I have never been to a restaurant that has a lunch menu on the weekend?? Needless to say we never got served because we left since we couldn't order what we wanted. We were the only people in the whole restaurant so they definitely needed the business. I guess it wasn't that important..."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of going to the bathroom after I ordered my meal and it was disgusting. Two stalls were out of order .. one had no door.. another was stopped up with a female's monthly and the two that were available for use needed as much cleaning as the dirty and sticky floors and filthy makeup filled counters .. for some odd/dumb reason I still decided to stay and try my meal. The food took forever to arrive and was cold when it got there. The shrimp were mediocre. The collar greens tasted like they were cooked with no seasoning and boiled in dirty water. The mac and cheese tasted like the boxed package kind a child could make. The music was good but so loud that we had to yell to have a conversation. Our waitress was nice and attempted to apologize for the experience."}
{"text":"Chicken and Sausage Gumbo was as good as anything I have had in New Orleans where I lived for over 40 years.  My fried shrimp and my wife's fried catfishes were well seasoned, crispy and hot. The bread pudding was not New Orleans style, it was better.  Good enough to make you swallow your tongue as my country relatives would say.

Service was good and the owner, Oscar, came by the table to check on things.  We will definitely return and take friends with us."}
{"text":"Let's start with the $4 cover to dine here. SMH. The service is HORRIBLE!!!! We had 4 different people as our server. Menu items were not available on a Friday night. We ordered our food and sure as the sky is blue, the order was incomplete. Really? How hard is it to bring wings and one side? After I finished my wings, my side came. Huh? No thank you. Our drinks were never refilled. It's sad that this establishment cannot get it together. Let me just say that this place was not very crowded. I'm disappointed because I really wanted it be great. Well, we tried...I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've visited this restaurant, the first time for a friends birthday on a Friday night. It wasn't too busy but they messed my order up completely, brought me the wrong dish and by the time I received my food everyone was finished eating. Now, the second time around one person at the table didn't even receive their food. And another person didn't receive a regular beverage she ordered until after her food arrived, I've worked in the food service industry and I feel this place has a lot of potential to be great, but at this point I'd even settle for mediocrity....."}
{"text":"I had a great time there! Live music, great food and wonderful staff. Highly recommend for out of towners."}
{"text":"The service was awful, waited 45 min after being seated for someone to take my drink order. Was there to see Case perform as Bluenote stated on their website, he never performed. After waiting more than 2 hours for Case people began to get agitated and asking where is he. Over heard the peolple from the table next to me saying Case is there but will not come out to perform. Then all of a sudden the dj starts playing Case music, I did not pay $40 to hear the dj play. No explanation from Blunotes.
Me along with everyone else there was SCAMMED by Blunotes of Charlotte"}
{"text":"I've read other reviews that weren't so stellar and thought to myself, \"How bad could it be?\"

I'm able to confirm that it's about as bad as some have said. 

I went with family and friends for brunch on a slow Sunday.   Our party had seven and we were told it would be just a moment to get our table together.   That wasn't an issue until it took 15 minutes to push two tables together.   That's not an exaggeration.   I could see the tables in question and they did not need to be cleaned, but it took 15 minutes for someone to push them together and place some menus on them.   

That aside, once seated it took another fifteen minutes before a server came by.   Our tables weren't in a corner, but rather in a high foot traffic area and we weren't acknowledged during that time.  An individual did finally stop by, take drink orders, and return.     However, we never saw him again, and finally flagged down another server and asked if we could order.   She said she'd find who was our server and take care of it.   

Fifteen minutes later, we neither saw her or anyone else come by and take our order.  We were now 45 minutes into this experience, and with young children clamoring for food, we made the decision that we could not wait any longer and left.

I'd love to comment on the food.  The menu looks great.  For those who can order, it's probably very good but we never made it that far.  The restaurant is spacious and has a nice ambience.   I'd love to see them succeed.   However, the waitstaff seems to be very lackadaisical and disinterested in providing service in a timely fashion.  

This restaurant is probably great for those who just want to sit at the bar and have a drink or those that enjoy two hour meals.   But if you have less time, or children that may want to eat within an hour, this isn't the place for you until the waitstaff and managers decide to be more responsive to customers.   

I'll give it one more chance in a few months, but as of now, the service is a one-star experience but I won't rate it that low because I have no idea if the food is any good."}
{"text":"Run and don't look back.  They do not use real silverware, plates, or glasses.  The food is ok but not worth the drama to order.  The band needed a tune up.  In my opinion they need to close and work out ALL the kinks and reopen in 2-3 months."}
{"text":"We have given this restaurant the benefit of the doubt 3 times, because we really wanted to have some place to go to that was close to home.  We went to the soft opening and yes...lots of problems.  We gave them a second chance a week later and got there around 6 on a Friday night, and the restaurant was a quarter full.  We couldn't get a table because we didn't make a reservation.  We said ok and sat at the bar for an hour.  No one got seated in the high top bar tables for the entire hour we were there.  We left and ate somewhere else.  We've given these folks one last shot, and they fell short once again.  We went on a Sunday night after receiving a text with their specials.  We got there about 730 and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant.  They did seat us at a high top.  We waited 10 minutes for someone to come to our table.  We ordered 2 drinks and waited another 10 minutes to get them.  The waiter had no idea of the specials and had to ask a bartender, and they conversed over that for a few minutes trying to figure the specials out.  We ordered wings which were on special.  After 15 minutes the waiter told us our order was delayed because a manager had to ring in the wings a special way.   When we finally got our wings they were cold.  We told the waiter, and the manager came over to give us a discount.  The bill showed the discount, but it never was deducted.  We were so fed up by then we paid the full price anyway and told the waiter we will never be back.  It's been a month since they opened, and they are still serving everything in/on plastic.  Poorly managed, spotty food and not worth the trip."}
{"text":"They are so slow we got up and left. We sat for 30 minutes and they had not taken our order. There were maybe 15-20 people in the entire place and we were a party of five. Very sad!"}
{"text":"I usually like to visit places a few times before I give a review.  BluNotes is no different.  I've visited on numerous occasions and always manage to find a seat at the bar.  The drinks are mediocre at best.  To claim yourself as a \"New Orleans\" styled bar, you will need to step up your drinks - flavorless Hurricane just  makes me want to order straight liquor.  We were there on a recent Saturday night and the musical entertainment absolutely sucked.  When I think New Orleans, I think jazz, blues with a little R&B mixed in between.  I don't know what crowd this restaurant is catering to, but it is certainly not the crowd and faces that were in the bar last Saturday night. Fast forward last night (Tuesday) apparently it was talent \"try-outs\".  The individual who handles the talent was extremely rude to one of the hopefuls.  To the point that it was noticed by the patrons.  She was covering her ears.  She asked him to cut down the base and finally interupted him during his set, saying \"...she didn't like it\".  Meanwhile the patrons at the bar and around the restaurant were grooving to the music.  That really left a nasty taste in me and some other guests mouths, so we decided to leave.  Restaurants in that location come and go.  You have to cater to what the people want.  I wish you much success, but I don't think we'll be back for a while.  Sad, because you have the potential to be something really great!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great with the live music but DO NOT ORDER A MIXED DRINK!  We went there in a group and ALL the mixed drinks are terrible.  Nothing tasted like it should nor the way it was  described. Had to instruct bartender how to make my drink and my friends'drinks better, in order to TRY to finish them.  I did not try the food. We all opted for beer, wine or just straight liquor for the second round! The live music would be worth another visit."}
{"text":"I passed by here with friends a few weeks ago on a Saturday night and noticed that a new place had opened up, and that it was PACKED. 

To avoid the rush, we visited on Sunday and ordered a full rack of ribs, cajun fried shrimp, and mac n' cheese, red beans and rice, and salad as the sides. We also ordered a caramel pecan dessert that was on special. The food was amazing, especially the ribs! The only issue was that they had run out of a few items.

We visited again on a Friday night and got there in time for live music. Tons of people were there and the parking lot was very nearly full, but the wait was still under 15 minutes and service was fast. We ordered the ribs (they're so good!) and gumbo. Again, the food and service were excellent.

There aren't many cajun places around here, so finding great cajun/creole food at a good price was a treat! We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"The music was wonderful. The hostesses were very friendly. Our server Jordan was very nice and accommodating to us. The fried catfish was good. The gumbo was good, but someone might have dumped the bottle of pepper in it. The collards and Mac and cheese need help. The food was medium in temperature. And even though the menu says the bread pudding is a favorite it is not good. Do not waste your money. I would not recommend this place for food, but the music is so worth it."}
{"text":"Blu-notes left me feeling blue...and a little angry.  Arrived at 7:15.  It's 8:30, and no food yet.  Appetizer of Gator Bites....toughest I've ever had, but the breading was good.....may have sprained my jaw.  Grilled Oysters....small, dry, and unappetizing.  50 minutes and counting.  Did we order something difficult?  Bowl of gumbo, red beans and rice, fried shrimp, and a steak.  I'll review the food tomorrow since it's unlikely I'll see it before then.  Manager came by to \"pull some strings\"  and wound up offering free desert, which I wasn't going to order anyway.

So-an update.  After 1:30, we got up and left.  Manager said...too bad, I just saw your food in the window.  I had heard the red beans and rice are good and the same about the gumbo.  We'll never know.  The sad thing is, they could have cooked our order 20 times over in that time period.  Red Beans and rice, already made.  Gumbo - ladle it over rice in a bowl.  Fried shrimp-5 minutes.  Steak-5 minutes."}
{"text":"They really need a lot of help with cleanliness .... The food is  just okay. I cannot recommend this place due to issues with cleanliness .. The water we drank tasted like mold. I hope they have improved the training of their staff."}
{"text":"The food is horrible that is the bottom line. I eat all over the country. Service is wacked. I have been there four times to try to support this business. One time, I was charged $20 to get in for nothing. The band was horrible, I came back another night and paid $4. The young lady that was singing was a 10. she was excellent.  I will continue to go back to support this business, but only to have a drink and listen to the live music. I am hoping that they read this review and Start immediately to fix the food. I want this business to succeed."}
{"text":"My Bluenote experience was a sour note from the begining...I walk in and initially pay $4.00 a person just to have some dinner.. I guess because they had some young guys tharlt were attempting to play some jazz that Bluenote needed to pay them...I get it....
We got seated and ordered a few drinks...We had been at Fahrenheit on top of the Hyatt and just had an amazing Moscow Mule...There it was served in a copper mug and was yummylucious...Here, it was served in a high ball glass void of ginger beer or any bitters..It was horrific...
3 people 3 different meals and only 2 items were decent.. Yes i said 2 items...Shrimp and grits were deplorable. .Shrimp were MIA, and could not be found. I preseume that they were hiding in the immense amount of Nacho cheese sauce... That plate was a bust... Poor Boy plate was horrific, old dried out bread and canned red beans with minute rice...The bright spot on that plate was the french fries. The final plate was the catfish which was great...However the sides were not..Collards should not be doused with vinegar but splashed, if we are going to have mac with crab, should there not be some crab?
Fyi, when the Mac gets old add sime milk and regenerate so that it is not dry and it can be cheesy and moist... I want to support black owned business, and to be the best we have to improve daily. ...was this just a bad note or is this the normal sound of the bluenote????"}
{"text":"The land of the plastic....plastic plates, plastic utensils, plastic beer glasses, and drum roll please... PLASTIC wine glasses 

Feels like you're eating at a soup kitchen.  The live music was great, but seems like that's the only thing going for this place at the moment.

You'd be better off stopping at the ABC store right next door,picking up some hungry howies in the next shopping center over, and heading home. Taffer....where are you?????"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I will be surprised if this restaurant is open at the end of the year. I came to this establishment with 5 friends and from the beginning something seemed off. We had to wait ten minutes to be seated but there were plenty of empty tables. Then the bartender came to take our order and he did not write it down. I asked if he would remember the order and he said yes. Let's just say I was right. The order was totally wrong. Two dishes came out right, four dishes came out wrong. One manager came to check on us and never came back after our terrible service. Then another manager came back and said she would give us a discount. She came back with subpar desserts and a $2 discount off the ticket. I will never be back. Please shut down this establishment."}
{"text":"Food was terrible and there were flies all over the table. The waitress was nice and the Space large, but there was no entertainment or notable music playing, which would've been nice. Both drinks I ordered were weak and without flavor. In fact, I didn't finish either and sent back the first (Margaritas ). the drunken shrimp was horrible ... As if they took concentrated bbq sauce, lemon and ketchup and just dumped cocktail shrimp right in. We also had the crawfish rolls (couldn't taste crawfish, too preprocessing, no freshness) which our server said were their best items, we were so displeased we canceled our main order. My friend and I will NOT return although we love to support local cuisine and venues. Our experience with the food, drinks, cleanliness and basic restaurant expectations were terrible unfortunately."}
{"text":"Three star rating was for my waitress only! Other than that.. not sure if, I will return back! First of all, BluNotes need to fire the front desk hostesses!  She started and ended our (first experience) nite  at BluNote on a bad note! First  of all...we didn't know a 24 hour seating reservation was needed to chill, drink and listen to a live band! The hostesses asked us....do you want a table? We said yes, not knowing there was a 30 minute wait on  \"tons\" of open dining tables/ bar space.  Our waitress was attentive to our needs. She made our nite fun while playing pool and listening  to the band. Now the cash out part...our waitress cashed us out with no issues. The hostesses...cashed us out on a negative note! She lost our drivers license  during  cashing our  pool table bill. (They hold your driver license when playing pool)  She ran/walked all over the restaurant looking for our driver's license. She argued with us...by saying she gave us back our license! Smh!!!  Finally..my friend...let her have it!(feeling was hurt!)  Shortly three other staff members helped her find our driver's license! Smh!!  After finding it, cashing us out. Her attitude was sour! She tried to reverse it by making  the mix up our fault! Smh!!!! Long story shorten........Fire that chick or put her in the kitchen washing dishes! She definitely lacks communication & organizational skills!"}
{"text":"Valentine's Day dinner at BluNotes. Had reservation  for 4:30 and was seated. Paid for 4 course meal for 2 and the soup and salad arrive 1 hour later. Then another hour to get the main course  and only 15 minutes to get desert. Forgot to mention I paid in advance for a 4 course meal which turned out to be 3. Waited 45 minutes additional to get check for wine and a drink. Band was good though. Don't think I will go back for dinner."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a half star I would. After me and my party of 4 waited over an hour for a table I ordered beignets and 30 after everyone else got there food...wings,  ribs, fries,  collard greens. I was told the kitchen was closed and my order was never made. This is the 3rd time this place has fouled me. I will never come back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent food. When we ordered the gumbo we added shrimp for $2 but they didn't add it into the dish. When we told the waiter she didn't take it off our tab....

I ordered a drink and they said the bartender wasn't making that tonight... 

Good music. Need to work on some stuff though. 

P.S. if you want ribs come after 7pm"}
{"text":"I hung out with one of my roommates from undergrad. We got there an hour or so before midnight so that we could eat quickly and head to another spot as we were a little skeptical about ringing in the New Year there. Well, what a pleasant surprise from the food to the drinks. The hostess was extremely rude when she found out we opted out on the $50 guest list but everyone else was extremely warm and inviting. I believe we had more fun than anyone else in the establishment. When the bartenders joined us in singing \"Purple Rain\" I knew I had found a new bar family. The honey barbecue wings were delicious and Tina's blackened catfish was amazing. At 42 it's sometimes hard to find a nice comfortable eatery \"where everybody knows your name\" but I think I just hit the jackpot.  Kudos to Brittany and the rest of the bartenders for their exceptional service!!!!"}
{"text":"Live blues and Cajun food--what more could you want? The house band was great, and they mixed it up with local walk-on talent.  Beer selection was phenomenal, and menu prices were very reasonable.  Portions could've been a little bigger, but for the prices getting multiple dishes to share is no problem. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This probably the worst experience out in the charlotte area that I have had ever. The place was pretty empty and it still took over an hour to get my food. Plus we paid a $30 cover charge for 2 and the show started late. Never again."}
{"text":"Love this place..it's like a Louisiana style wet willies!!!

Very lively atmosphere 

Don't be turned off by the plastic utensils unless you're bougie person then this place is not for you.

Food is amazing and reasonably priced.

I love it"}
{"text":"Maybe because it was a Saturday night but the service was really slow the live jazz was cool $4 fee was alright I guess but waiting 20min on two drinks . Also I order the pasta with mushrooms guess what I saw  couldn't even get to change the order because the waiter never came to check on how did I like the food. Only time I saw him frequently is when the check was needed to be picked up. I heard good things about this place my experience wasn't that, my assumption is mayb because it was a Saturday night idk"}
{"text":"Thought about trying something new do we pulled up to this place. Yes we were greeted and seated quickly. There was a 25 minute wait until someone asked us if we'd like a drink. Meanwhile waitresses were talking at the bar and gathering at the door. Our waitress finally arrive 10 minutes after we got our beverages. It took 20-30 minutes for the food to come out. Keep in mind we ordered wings for appetizers, they came out with our entrées. Everything was BLAND!!! Red beans and rice taste like it was straight from the can. Wings were tough. Shrimp and grits were ok. Not going back."}
{"text":"Our first visit was on Valentines Day.  The live music was great. The service started out slow. Took 50 minutes to get our drink order. I ordinarily would have walked out but we had pre-paid for our meal. 

Glad we stayed. After the drink order everything arrived in a timely manner. I think our waitress was new. After we had been there a while several employees stopped by checking on us including the owner who introduced himself. I can tell they are working on improving their service.  

The food was excellent. Hope they work out the customer service kinks. We'll be back to give it another try."}
{"text":"Came out for the soft opening the other week, thought it could've been better.

We dropped in shortly after 5p on that Thursday. Greeted right away at the door. Can appreciate that. Proceeded to ask for a table and they came back asking if we had a reservation. We didn't. As such, they told us nothing was available. Really? Nothing? So you wouldn't leave ANYTHING available for one or two walk-ins? Lol ok... 

Luckily, we found the last two open seats at the bar. The bar tender was really nice but the entire staff in general seemed in extra slow mode. We got a few drinks, modestly priced, not terrible. We wanted a food menu but never got one over the course of 30 minutes. She said there was shortage of menus. Lol ok... We wound up asking our neighbors to borrow theirs. Surprised to find no appetizers whatsoever. Well, it's not the full menu they said. I know it's a soft opening but... you're still a bar... how do you not serve apps, even on a soft opening?

Anyway, I do like what they've done with the place, definitely a Nawlins feel to it.

Hoping they get the kinks worked by the next visit."}
{"text":"This venue has the same interior layout that Fanz Sports Bar had at this location. I love the wide variety of music genres that they offer on different nights of the week. The live bands have all been awesome both times that I have been there. Food is good but prices were higher than expected. Cocktails on my second visit were A+!! I highly recommend you call ahead of time to make reservations and verify what event will be going on. If you don't might standing most of the night then pop up if you want to."}
{"text":"Great  place for a teacher happy hour! BlueNotes offered delicious appetizers to the staff at our School for a Holiday get together, and the food was wonderful.  The bar had a good selection and the service was fantastic. Let us know if you think about offering any more \"teacher happy hours\", what a great idea! You have the best location."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting, and the live music is about all I would come back for. I ordered the fried gator bites and crawfish eggrolls as apps; and for my entree - fried catfish with collards and crab mac n chz as my sides. The gator bites were not battered and were chewy with barely any flavor. They served them with a dipping sauce and lemons that barely saved them. The eggrolls were not crisp and fell apart. The flavor in the eggrolls was seriously lacking. They start the table off with cornbread but only the first basket is free. They charge 35 cents for additional cornbread. The cornbread texture was good, it had jalapeño in it that seemed to over power it some, but overall they tasted good. Me and my friend both ordered the same entree and sides, and both had same reaction...not good. The fish was cooked well but lacked seasoning, the mac tasted odd or burnt...something I couldn't quite put my finger on, and the collards were cooked well but tasted like nothing but spice. A mouthful of spice. I sent mine back and got wings instead. Those were cooked well but again lacked flavor. 2 other friends with me ordered gumbo and red beans and rice...again no flavor just spice. This is supposed to be a cajun style restaurant but they need to understand cajun means spice AND flavor! Definitely need to go back to the drawing board on the food. Great music and space is large for drinks and just hanging out. Do not come here if you want to eat though.  

Update: changed from 2 stars to 1..we spent more time trying to pay for the mess than we did eating. It took over 30 minutes to get a check, have her take the payment, and then to only return with a new bill that had an added 18% gratuity, we asked for the manager and forever later she comes back with a new bill again saying sorry didn't mean to add 18% gratuity. Def not going back to this place."}
{"text":"Never got a chance to try because I made reservations to eat and like some greedy businesses during CIAA... They are charging $15 dollars just to enter the restaurant to eat!!!  They want to say it's because they have a show but having a show is apart of your appeal.  Damn GREEDY managers trying to get over on its Black customers because it's CIAA!  Please,  miss me! Good point... At least they called me before I showed up with my guest."}
{"text":"I walked in and was seared pretty quickly however we were seated for more than 20 min and no waitress came to even ask for a drink order. We went back to the hostess who sat us and she said the waitress was coming. Another 5 min went by and no waitress. Then the hostess came back and asked if we wanted to sit at the bar as they were under staffed then asked if we would sit at a different table. We agreed and she advised that the waitress was right there. 15 min later we still had no drinks and were not even acknowledged. More of that then we got half of our order and had to chase the waitress down for the other half. They don't deserve 1 star."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, so I'm still not sure how I feel about this spot.  The first time I went,  I had a great experience. The most recent experience wasn't so good. They had a band there,  so the cover was $10, which is fine. There were several available seats,  so I didn't understand the long wait, but we were seated after 30 min.  The wait staff was very nice and professional. After we ordered our food it took 45 min to receive it.  I ordered fried cat fish,  mac n cheese and red beans and rice.  The person who brought us our food just dropped the plates on the table and left.  My food was cold,  the catfish was soggy and the mac n cheese was watery. The food is too expensive to be bad.  

On the other hand, the music was good and the staff is cool."}
{"text":"The new kid on the block resides in Davis Lake and if you remember the restaurant Bite Your Tongue, the menu will look very familiar to you as those owners are now affiliated with this restaurant.  I decided to avoid the crowd and stopped by for lunch with my son and was very impressed with the quick service and reasonably priced options.  I ordered a kid's meal of fried shrimp, fries and a drink for $6.99 and an order of red beans and rice at $5.99.  Their signature drink is called 'Strango' a blend of strawberry lemonade and mango tea and it is very tasty!  The shrimp were huge for a kids meal and seasoned to perfection and the red beans and rice were excellent as well.  I must admit I was pleasantly surprised that we were in and out in about 45 minutes so lunch it is for me.  We decided to return for brunch after church to try the chicken and sweet potato waffles but we were told they didn't have them today so we left and hopefully they will have them next Sunday.  Also, they have live music almost daily including brunch so check them out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Thee absolute worst service.  Management have no concept of customer service.  Don't bother with open table....there will not be a table available and open for you.  Have your $4 cover ready...\"because you should have read it online.\" Service is extremely slow.  Sides either came out 10-15 min earlier or later than main entrees.  Not one person at our table of 13 had good things to say about their meal.  Just don't waste your money or time!!  Jessica is nice but that's about it!"}
{"text":"Honestly I worry that they will be able to make it because their price point for their food is so low.  We had a great meal.  The crab cakes Benedict did not disappoint.  This is one of my favorite meals so it was a good comparison.  They do not serve a true hollandaise sauce, but it was a butter sauce with shrimp.  

The decor was trendy and they had a great place for locals at the bar with TV's.  They also had a private room and pool tables.  For the Sunday Jazz brunch they open at 10am, but the live music does not begin until 1pm.  This was the reason for my four stars as we would have gone later had we known."}
{"text":"VERY disappointing experience. Plastic silverware, cups & plates. EXTREMELY slow service. We were seated about 8:15, food order was not taken until 9p & food was not received until 9:45 for some in our group & about 10:15 for others in our group. It took about an hour to get a coke after I was told that my initial order of Strawberry Lemonade was not placed because the kitchen threw it out because it tastes funny. The management was unbothered by our wait & the many other problems we experienced during the entire night. When we asked our waitress for a receipt & questioned the amount of the bill because it did not include the discount that we were told we would receive, she told us to do the MATH! She said that they did not care if we NEVER came the F*** back & they did not need our business because they made ALOT of money. Well, no love lost! We don't EVER want to come back & will be sure that everyone knows how poorly & unprofessional this establishment & their staff are. Word to the wise, don't waste your money & time on this place. Ill be surprised if this place lasts a year. Go to the Cajun Queen for your live music, great food & exceptional service."}
{"text":"Went there on the Sunday after their \"Grand Opening\".  Unlike the experience from many of the other reviews, my timing here was one where they weren't packed to the rim.  Thus, this gave the newly opened (and still working things out) restaurant a bit of breathing room when it came to delivery of service and food. 

Being from Louisiana (not Nawlins, tho) I have a certain level of expectation when it comes to a place that offers food from my family's home state.  I can state honestly that their food was NOT the same as I get when with family, but then again, the difference is what you find when comparing Cajun vs New Orleans. There's a lot of crossover but both have their own thing.  I can say that the food was what I expected from this style of Restaurant and was very pleased. 

In acknowledging that they were opening a brand new restaurant, they went with a reduced menu that focused on what they could deliver.  We decided to start with the crawfish eggrolls as a starter, and even though I don't eat seafood (crazy for a cajun, huh?), I actually enjoyed the flavors experienced here.  We thought the rolls were better without the pepper jelly but that is a personal taste thing.

For our entrees, my wife went with the blackened fish (tilapia, I believe) and I chose to go with the Sausage and Chicken Gumbo with sides of Jambalaya and Red Beans and Rice.  The gumbo was as good as any I've tasted that didn't get prepared in a family kitchen, the jambalaya had good flavor balance although it was a bit sweeter than my own dish because they start theirs with a marinara sauce.  Then there was the red beans and rice...This was a spot on accurate and wonderful example of this dish, which isn't surprising since that originated from the crescent city.  If you want a dish to let the restaurant tell you who it is, go with Red Beans and Rice.   I even tried the blackened fish and found it not bad at all.

For dessert, I got their signature white chocolate bread pudding and my wife got beignets.  Both were awesome.

Was everything perfect?  No.  But they're a new kitchen and working the kinks out.  They are in the process of fixing problems with the location and seem to have a clear plan.  You also need to understand that if you're going on a live music night, they're gonna maximize seating and don't really want folks buying an appetizer and sipping on water for 2 hours...

Go for the food, go for the music.  Go to support a locally owned New Orlean's style restaurant that WILL get things right."}
{"text":"If I could list zero stars as a rating I surely would. The service at this location and care for the customer on a of 1 to 10 is \"0\".  In a nutshell this restaurant \"owner\"chose to charge me a $5 cover coverage, due to an error on my part (not making the \"in by 7 guideline\") on a live entertainment night. Now I called before 7 to explain why I would be late.  But...was told I needed to pay. The owner refused to talk to me on the phone and upon arriving to the restaurant about this matter. During past visits the food was not tasty. And...... for the record, I was just trying to help a friend celebrate her birthday.
For the record, the \"new manager\" came over, apologized, and asked if he could do anything. In the words of my traveling Soror, \" I am just saying\"."}
{"text":"We had a chance to go for the first time last night.  We had reservations for 8pm.  When we got there, we had to wait for another 10 minutes as others were seated.  Once we were seated, it took 15 min. for someone to come take drink orders.  Another 20 minutes later, I had to ask for water.  Once drinks arrived, one drink was wrong...and so we shared my drink.  Then several people checked on us asking is everything ok... we said no.  Asked where was the food (we are now going on an hour).  We ordered a burger and grilled shrimp.  When the food finally came, the red beans and rice tasted like it was from a can.  The music venue was decent, thank goodness.  That was the saving grace.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"Food was good still working out the kinks ! Bar needs work, very slow on service. I will go back and try again!  Bbq shrimp and shrimp and grits are a must!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my evening out to blunotes. The food was good. I ordered the seafood Alfredo and my husband ordered the steak. The steak was seasoned to perfection. I kept eating off his plate. My waitress was very nice. She was a very hard worker even while pregnant. The only improvement would be their sound system. If they had bigger and better speakers I believe the sound would be better. That's why I gave them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Attended an event here recently. I have always  liked this spit as far as the roominess, chilled environment and crowd it draws.  The service was good, food was great!  I had the catfish whicmch was light fresh and crispy and well seasoned. The greens were very tasty and I must say I consider myself a greens zealot. Truly they would be in my top 5 \"best greens\" category . The lobster Mac n cheese, though good did not deliver. When a menu says lobster, I'm looking for a sweet juicy chunk somewhere in the dish. NOT!  On to the bar service...  Drinks were as my Grandpa would say, \"ineffective\" and small for a pretty hefty price - as is true for many establishments in the QC. 
So why the \"2 star rating\"?...  I and my friends were insulted by the obligatory 20% gratuity that they failed to mention was added to my bill!!!!  And when the final bill for signature came out, there was another tip line added!   PATRONS BEWARE AND READ YOUR BILL THOROUGHLY! I arrived as an an individual with 2 other ladies. Please tell me, to what did I deserve this imposed tip!?..  Was it because, unbeknown to me, I was considered a part of a \"group\" when I attended the event? Or was it because the event was attended mainly by African American guests whom BLU NOTES owners prejudged as poor tippers??  For whatever reason, it's a TERRIBLY OFFENSIVE business practice.  Once again, our people being treated differently and unfairly -- by our own people.. Smh"}
{"text":"CMS had a Christmas gathering here. The food was good and waitstaff attentive. I'm going back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I'm grading on a curve.  Would I go here for food again.  Nah, probably not.  Maybe apps.  But I'm happy to have a happening spot out in my neck of the woods.  We went last Friday night.  After I picked my jaw up off the floor at a 10 dollar cover my party of 6 went to our reserved table.  The waitress was attentive, but not overly so.  It did take awhile to get drinks, but I don't think that was her so much as the bar.  The drinks,  now they were on point.  Very good.  The food was just average.  Very average.  But I'll be back.  It's a nice spot, with really good music and easy parking away from the normal hustle bustle of uptown."}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that the university area has a new entertainment establishment. We really need more things to do for grown folks. I understand it's only been a couple of weeks and like anything else you have to give it time to flourish. I give it 2 stars for location and the fact our waitress was pleasant. When waiting to be seated your in the spotlight because you have to walk across the open space in front of the live band and patrons that are watching. I felt like doing a twirl. HA.

The set up is exactly the same set up as the former restaurant that was there midtown sundries. As soon as our waitress greeted us the first thing she said was let me tell you what we don't have on the menu. NOT a good sign. We figured let's order the most simplest thing which was the po'boy sandwich. It was the worst sandwich I ever eaten. They give you 6 small shrimp on a toasted bagete bread which was way too much bread. The shrimp was way too salted. Very disappointed being that I had a taste for creole..

The live band sounded like ole folk music. No one seemed interested especially since 90% of your customers are african American. I think they should stick with contemporary jazz and invite our local favorite Shableek.

We decided to check out the rest of the place and they have a lounge with pool tables and a large flat screen tv in the back. Nothing special. Just a bunch of women huddled together. I think I'll give it another try in the next couple of months to give them time to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Worst Saturday night in a long time! Menu very limited. Made a walk in reservation for birthday. They lost the reservation and refused to seat us until our party arrived. Scorched rice in the gumbo, chef would not accept responsibility, rolled his eyes and walked off. Delivered water, no glasses. Manager did not discount bill. The server forgot one of the parties orders, declined his meal after the server realized it 45 mins later. The live jazz band could have put a toddler gassed up on sugar to sleep! Oh and not to forget there's a 15$ cover charge!!! DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME OR MONEY GOING TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT. It's unorganized, the service is absolute garbage and the food is blah. Nothing to marvel over AT ALL."}
{"text":"Let me start by stating I am a foodie and I have went to various restaurants nationwide and internationally and this is by far the worst experience I have ever had.We arrived to the restaurant at 6:30pm and left at 9:10pm.  We did not spend 2hours and 40 minutes by choice, but due to the restaurant's inability to function properly.

I attended the restaurant with 5 other guests and we were seated within 15 minutes which is great for a Saturday evening.  An individual greeted us and stated he will be \"our waiter and bartender\" and took our drink orders.  We later received our drinks, but the individual did not not come back for at least 20 minutes to take our order.  When he took our orders, he did not write anything down.  We jokingly asked \"Are you going to remember all that?\" and he stated he would remember all six orders.  As time went on, no one checked on us for at least 35 minutes and the waiter was never seen again. Eventually, a lady came by and asked \"Is everything going okay?\" I explained to her it was not and we have waited an extremely long time for our food.  The lady expressed her apologies and went to check on our order.  This is when the experience took a complete downfall and one word cannot even describe the experience. Two orders came out which were fine but missing one side.  Another order came out 10 minutes later which was fine.  Another order came out 5 minutes later which was completely the wrong salad.  The salad was replaced and the chicken was cold and the lettuce was not fresh causing the guest to eat it.  I would say thirty minutes went by and two individuals still had not received their meals, which were 2 orders of Cajun Shrimp with sides of collards, rice & beans, mac & cheese.  By this time multiple workers were involved in the situation and could not simply get the last two orders together.  Not only that, but the other guests at the table were done with their meals and two individuals had not received their meals at all.  After a hour (no exaggeration), the two shrimp plates were received.  

The individuals working with the table sent the manager out and I was able to explain the experience.  The manager portrayed to care about the situation and stated it was unacceptable.  Her solution was to provide desserts to the table and to adjust the checks.  I rejected the desserts, but the other guests accepted.  From experience, when a manager states they will adjust a check it means they will reasonably adjust the check for the inconvenience the customer endured, it is their way of showing they are sincerely sorry, and to show the customer it was a mistake and would not happen again. Their solution should leave room for the customer to say \"You know what it is a mistake. I would give them another chance.\"  NOPE!  Not this manager. The manager deducted TWO DOLLARS from each check.  This solution was a complete insult and I was highly disappointed in the fact she thought that was reasonable despite her providing desserts. To have waited for two shrimp plates for ONE HOUR, the meal should have been taken off the check.  For a salad to come to the table incorrectly TWICE, the salad should have been removed from the check.  Not only that, I explained to the waiter/manager the way the check should have been splitted amongst the parties and even that was wrong causing us to be in the restaurant longer.  It was so bad all guests became irritable and were ready to go.  One guests did not even wait on their change to come to the table.

Overall, I would not to return to this restaurant nor recommend it to others.  This restaurant could possibly have the opportunity to tighten its bolts and screws down the road, but I wouldn't give them the time of my day to see if it changes. 

Pros: Out of all the food ordered, the shrimp plates were good, although I would prefer more seasoning in the rice & beans.  I heard one guests say the wings were awesome, as well as the Shrimp & Grits."}
{"text":"We went here for New Years Eve, very tacky and ghetto establishment.. who serves wine is a plastic cup?? The tables were more like couches and sofas from Value City with nightstands next to them. I would never step foot back in this place. The music was good... but Kid Capri was the DJ, so maybe that's why."}
{"text":"Shit food and worse service. When it was midtown at least they had decent food. Whoever bought this place should be ashamed of themselves. They took a mediocre neighborhood bar and turned it into slums."}
{"text":"Okay, we all know it's a new place and not perfect. But this was unacceptable even under those conditions. 

We skipped the grand opening because of the communal table situation. Today we decided to try it out for lunch. When we entered we saw a huge party being served, We should have known better and left right then. We were seated right away and ordered and appetizer and two lunch entrees. 40 minutes later, we were still sipping our water and no food. They began to ask us if everything was \"good\" and I said \"NO, we've been here for 40 minutes!\" Our waitress said, \"I'm going in there and tell them to hurry it up.\" Well, next, a manager type saw my agitation and said he would comp us for some of it. I said to the waitress that they needed to comp us the ENTIRE meal. The waitress said they were sorry but the 40 person party interfered with their service. \"Who books a 40 person party at lunch on your first week of business?\", I asked. She said the just walked in. Yeah, right. They were greedy. and ruined their service for the remaining customers.

The appetizer of craw-fish egg roll was sopping wet with grease from the fryer. Disgusting. My craw-fish etouffee  was simply ok and served in disposable white foam bowl (their entire restaurant is served on plastic disposables, including drinks from the bar and wine). That alone is unacceptable. I will not pay those prices and eat my meal with a plastic fork! My wife's fried oyster po-boy was mostly bread and filler. We ate what we could(we were hungry!) and left. They did comp the entire fiasco. It was worth nothing.

We waited so long for this restaurant to be open, and now we are totally disappointed and will not return. There is no reason to!
 If you are interested in really good etouffee, go to Boudreux's in NoDa. 

If I could give it less than one star, I would. Fail."}
{"text":"I specifically went back for the beignets. I had them once and fell in love. I ordered them to-go the second time and they looked COMPLETELY different and much smaller but the same price. The gumbo is decent if you don't add shrimp. The staff didn't seem knowledgeable about their menu."}
{"text":"Group of us came for my sisters birthday dinner. From the beginning there was confusion, from the $4 cover charge to get in to the cashier trying to give us TOO much money back. Because we had integrity we told her multiple times that she is giving us too much money bc we didn't want her register to be short. The entrees came out before the appetizer. The food was not delivered at the same time. One of the persons in the party didn't get her food until after we all finished. We had multiple managers that came to talk to us but they all seemed to just brush the issue under the rug and was still trying to sell desert. Our server Erika was very polite and kind however we did not have the best experience here. We would suggest promptly bringing out the ALL the food for everyone. The drinks were watery. Had to take them back and once they were re made they were still bad. The manager Tom came to the table a few times to try and accommodate us bit seemed a bit spacey. Next time we will check the reviews before coming to a new place. This place has potential but isn't not there yet. Live music was good but that was about it."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service, they were out of gumbo, shrimp dish was cold, and fried green tomatoes were just ok.  There is nothing I would go back for.  It's a shame because it is a nicely sized restaurant with entertainment in the North Charlotte area.  Need a new staff and to fix the service issue if they want a chance at survival."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and the food was okay.  I would have preferred a little more NOLA seasoning.  Nice size portions.  Great live band"}
{"text":"I visited BluNotes on a Sunday for brunch. I had the chicken and waffle meal with a mimosa. The fried chicken was juicy and seasoned very well! Our servers were friendly, knowledgable and attentive. As were the other staff/floor managers who circulated frequently to check on us. I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, real silverware would have made it feel more upscale. Waitress was great! Thanks Lexi!"}
{"text":"12.26.15
They have real plates and silverware! They also have a more condensed easy to read menu, they've changed some of the recipes, and it's all for the better! The gator tail was great, maybe smaller pieces but cutting them achieves this. The shrimp and grits was amazing this time. Last time they had a strange patty, and while I commend creativeness, the creamy shrimp and grits with real bacon crumble, and regular sized shrimp was a hit! The gumbo was even better than before! The andouille melts in your mouth and it tastes as if it's been simmering for hours. The beignets got a makeover now, they are smaller and less greasy but they need to bring back a little more of the powdered sugar. Overall it was amazing and I like the changes they've made. Will definitely come back!



I've been getting notices about BluNotes opening here in our neighborhood. We wanted to go to the soft opening missed it. After getting a text reminder from them about their Grand Opening today, we decided to stop on in! We're really glad that we did. The staff was really friendly and the place has a very good vibe, and I like the decor. We got a bowl of the gumbo and the shrimp po boy and they were delicious! I really liked the flavors of each. We ended with a dessert of beignets, and they were fluffy powdery goodness! We will definitely be back, and we're excited about this new Jazz/Blues restaurant just down the street from us. I can't wait to see how they flourish and grow!"}
{"text":"My first visit here was today for brunch. I walked in, to what seemed as a closed restaurant, until I looked inside further and seen some patrons at a couple tables. No host, hostess, waiters, waitresses, or bartenders in sight! (I should have walked out then) Eventually someone comes from the back and ask if I just walked in.... Um, YES! So she seats me and gives me time to look over the menu. She was very attentive and her service was good (didn't get her name, sorry). I start my order off by advising of my shellfish allergy and she stated I could not get the catfish, which was fine. I ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of hashbrowns and asked if they could add onions. She stated it would be an upcharge of 0.50, which was fine. Food came and the hashbrowns seemed to automatically have peppers and onions and were lack luster. Rest of the food was OK, however I began to itch halfway thru my meal. Which means somewhere my food was in contact with shellfish! I advised the waitress of this, and asked for my bill because I had to rush home to get my medication. She apologized, brought me my bill and informed me they charged for the onions but took it off since they come in hashbrowns already. I paid and left, and will not be back there again! You would think management would be notified and come to check on a customer! And now my Sunday is ruined because I had to take medication that makes me drowsy, thus missing my nephew's birthday... NEVER AGAIN..."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Food is terrible. Everything tastes of cheap quality and like it's pre-made and just heated up upon request. It's an awesome venue, but not good use of it. The spoken word started over an hour later than they said. The drinks tasted like complete rubbing alcohol. I ordered ribs that were so spicy I couldn't even eat them, and I'm a fan of spicy foods! The lobster Mac n cheese was watery and flavorless. The French fries were the best part of my meal. As if the food wasn't bad enough, we waited for over 40 minutes for the waitress to bring the check! Nothing at all would make me go back to this establishment!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was chosen to be our evening entertainment venue for my family reunion in Charlotte, NC. It was only 10 minutes from the Hilton, and seemed to be a good choice for our family outting. So, being the event planner that I am, I called 5 days before our reunion to make a reservation for 40 pole. So, the Event Manager calls me back 24 hrs later to tell me 1. She does not have space for indoor seating for 40 because she has other large reservations for indoor seating. 2. She has space for 20 for patio or space for 20 for indoor seating. If I request seating for 40 ppl on the patio she will have yo charge me $75 per hour! Mind you, she never even told me what the $75 per hour would cover. Of course I declined this ridiculous offer and decided to split the seating indoor and outdoor. So we arrive at 7:10 or so and the waitress seats us. We have the table indoors for 20, and also there were 8 extra seats right next to our table that the waitress kindly let us sit at. Wow, I thought, since family members dropped out and we ended up having less that 40 ppl we can all fit. Eventually some family came later and sat in the patio. We eat, but the service was very unorganized bringing the wrong food to the wrong people. But we are aplogixed to by the waitress. after 40 minutes the Event Manager comes over and scolds the waitress for seating an extra 8 ppl indoors saying that the seats are reserved. Well obviously this was not communicated to the waitress because I originally told her of my previous arrangement with the Event mgr and the waitress insisted that we stay. So the Event mgr tells me that she will charge me if I keep the extra 8 ppl in the seating area or they can sit at the bar or in the patio.  Reluctantly I asked my family to move to the bar or patio. Thankfully my family did not mind, but for the EM to so brazenly insist that they leave those tables was very rude, which is why I am posting this. So, we eat, listen to the blues performance which I would not go to see for free. We are ther until 9:30 and guess what? Where's the other large party reservations? The 2 additional tables were still empty!! i even asked the Manager to tell me what time the reservations were scheduled for and explained the situation.....he never even got backup me. BLUNOTES OF CHARLOTTE, hire folks with EVENT PLANNING CERTIFICATION! You have a nice concept, but your SERVICE IS BAD, BAD, BAD. The food was ok, but the SERVICE LEFT A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Don't come for the food! Ordered shrimp and grits which had NO taste. I think they used velvetta cheese and a few shrimp. The presentation was lacking. Mom ordered shrimp po-boy which was loaded with lettuce, tomatoes on stale kaiser roll. The collared shad too much vinegar and red beans and rice was horrible. Rice was boiled rice out of a bag, beans tasted like canned beans. I shared my disappointment with our waiter who sent Manager over to our table. We sent all our food back except catfish. They took 50% off our bill. I have to tell you don't go for the food!!! Btw bathrooms had no toilet paper. And why did we pay $4 per person cover charge when we were ordering dinner?"}
{"text":"The music is good as well as the drink menu. The food, I'd never eat again. I had partically done fried catfish, crab mac&cheese which lacked crab and the worse offender...the collards. I didn't think it possible to mess up collards especially since the Owner is black and should no better. They were well seasoned but that seasoning was nasty. Nobody at my table could finish them. I found the Mgr a little to agressive when I asked him not to charge my Manager (birthday lunch) for my food. He demanded that I explain exactly what was wrong like he was a police officer investigating a kidnapping.

I'd go back for the music and drinks after eatting dinner at another restaurant."}
{"text":"SLOW, SLOW, SLOW! Its actually painful! Bartenders are slow and seem inexperienced. Here on mix and mingle night and it's not crowded but I would hate to see the service of it was. They need to get it together because there are just too many other places I could be right now spending my money."}
{"text":"Our waitress was nice, but the service was ridiculously slow.  The drinks were weak and I don't really like strong drinks and they were still weak. The food was good even though it was not served hot enough, I didn't send it back because it took too long to come out. I also ordered a chicken caesar salad to-go and they gave me cold hard pre-cooked and refridgerated chicken. This is unacceptable for a $12 salad and they gave me a hard time about remaking me fresh chicken. All and all I would probably will not return."}
{"text":"Such an unbelievable night. Michelle was the most attentive,authentic,sweetest bartender ever! Made us feel right at home. Music is great and the cover charge is VERY reasonable. $4.00!! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night with my fiance to avoid the weekend crowds and figured we could enjoy some Cajun/Creole food and maybe some canned Jazz/Blues music. Nope. Broken glass in the parking lot and then...

Food:
There were two menu items with Cajun names - NOLA shrimp and Mardis Gras chicken wings. The shrimp was in some kind of BBQ sauce and the chicken wings came in various sauces. There was NOTHING Cajun/Creole on the menu. We had shrimp scampi with southern green beans, fried okra and two kinds of Mardi Gras wings. The shrimp scampi was six shrimp with some store bought seasoning served on buttered spaghetti (nasty), the green beens were canned (nasty), the okra was good and so were the wings.

Staff:
Our waiter was friendly but utterly clueless on the menu. We asked him what came with their shrimp basket (maybe a salad, hush puppies, fries...) and he had no idea. He checked and returned to say fries.

Drinks:
Perhaps we can salvage this with some good drinks? Nope. Their drink specials ($5) were a list of alcohols. Like vodka, gin, crown, st. germane... How the heck do you order a drink? I asked our waiter for a vodka martini. He asked \"what's in a martini?\" I explained. Bartender sends him back to see if I want dry or sweet vermouth. \"Dry please\" I say. My \"martini\" arrives w/o olives (or anything) and is a 50/50 mix of vermouth and vodka. My fiance ordered a crown and ginger ale. She did not fare much better than me.

Music:
Nope, no Jazz or Blues on the speakers.

Atmosphere:
You're kidding right? It looked like a good setup for a live band though. You'll pay an extra cover charge ($7/pp) for that. Since we didn't go on a live night we enjoyed the stares from other diners and a group playing pool across the restaurant. We were seated away from everyone else. When we left I noticed a couple at another table glaring at us. I'd like to point out that we didn't complain to our waiter (or anyone else) and we were not loud or anything else you might consider bad behavior. Our crime? We're white. The only white folk in the place that night. We grew up around NYC and love all different cultures. Heck, we grew up with them. First time I ever felt racism - from some of the other patrons, not the staff.

Bottom Line: If you go, go for the live music and eat/drink before you go. Nope, not a beer list either."}
{"text":"Like so many others  i was excited to have Louisiana cuisine in charlotte and especially in the University area. Decided to stop by on a Friday night for dinner. Upon arrival, I was warmly greeted and advised of a 10 min wait. Hey no problem,  we will wait at the bar.  We were served two of the worst drinks of my life while we waited on by women with do rags and scarves  on their head. I'm sill trying to figure out what that was about. 

 A while later we were retrieved from the bar after my husband going back and forth to check on our wait. At this point ok, it's Friday night..no big deal.  We sit, 15 mins later a waitress comes to take our order ...and 45 mins later apps arrive. It pretty much gets worse from there If you can believe it . I'm not going to go through all the issues as you can see them in other reviews ..but basically slow service, nice although clearly incompetent wait staff, poor drinks, medicore food and on and on. The only reason why I am giving it one star would be for the young guys who played the live music - they were awesome.

Bottom line, please get it together so your community can support you. Otherwise you will be just another spot that people ask to themselves .\" didn't that used to be...\"?"}
{"text":"First time shame on us & second time shame us again.  Service was horrible because the restaurant ran out of silverware & cup.  Due to no utensil my food got cold waiting for utensils.  It was over crowded."}
{"text":"BluNotes is becoming my favorite hang out spot on Saturday nights because of the live music and atmosphere. I've been twice now, the first was for a Jazz Band with a Prince tribute. Hello?!? Sign me up!! It was also my husband's birthday so I reserved a table (24) using Open Table and had no issues when we got there. Yes, there is a $4 cover if you go during the live bands. Totally worth it! My second time going was on the blues night and it was fabulous! Overall with the live music, the sound is great, the acts they book are awesome and it's an amazing time. 

My issue is the same as alot of other Yelpers. I'm not sure if the wait staff system of assignment is up to par. It seems like random waiters and waitresses are always going to all the tables. It does take a while to get the food and drinks. My husband ordered a very expensive drink for his birthday and would have ordered another if our waitress came back in a timely fashion. I think a full morning of training and maybe an updated system would help out this issue alot. BUT, don't let this deter you from going during the live music because at least while you're waiting for your food, you'll be entertained. 

I'll be back next Saturday and the Saturday after next."}
{"text":"Disappointing first time experience. Used the online delivery service. Epic fail. The food was nothing to write home about. I am reconsidering attending an event scheduled here next week due to this experience. I called the restaurant to place my order. I was advised that I would receive a call back because the system was being used. I am still waiting. Placed the order online. The website stated a delivery time of 8:57 pm. My food arrived at 9:50 pm. I called the restaurant again and was advised by the manager that the owner would call me back. I'm still waiting on that call. Bland red beans and rice. Bland spicy chicken sandwich. Plain fried wings instead of cajun. I'm singing the blues after this meal"}
{"text":"Where oh where do I damn start.....?

I came here with a friend of mine before heading out to celebrate his birthday. I dunno why we didn't just go to Midnight Diner but hey, it's his birthday. Not mine.

First, there's a $5 cover. Not bad. Rent gotta be paid so I get it. Upon observation, one could easily tell that this is a place for the maw maw's and paw paw's of the world. And this isn't necessarily a bad thing. I just know that none of them will be at church in the morning.

Anyway, we both decided to order a tequila sunrise. Google it and you'll see that it's a fairly easy drink to make. Doesn't take much effort at all. The only problem was the bartender did this age old trick where the bottom is filled with water first and then liquor is added on top of that. I knew right then and there we should've carried our asses on home but again, his birthday, not mine.

We decided to order the crawfish egg rolls. I've had \"different\" egg rolls before, so the fact that they managed to roll some crawfish in seemed like it'd be impressive. Chile....they put a single crawfish tail in each egg roll (the appetizer came with two) and the rest was cabbage. Nothing but raw cabbage. Oh but it gets worse. They serve it with some type of pepper jam and when I tell you I'd rather eat the placenta of rabid dog, I'm not exaggerating. It was disgusting.

I decided to fix my face. Even though we're batting on two negatives, I figured that maybe the main courses would be better.

So, I ordered the catfish, fries, and rice and beans. They had \"crab Mac and cheese,\" but after the \"crawfish egg roll,\" I wasn't here for it. They also had collard greens and honestly, I'm cool on eating anyone's collards that ain't my mamas. So heavy carbs it was.

The fries were frozen Orida.

The red beans and rice were a can of over salted kidney beans with white rice on top.

And the fish wasn't cooked all the way through.

I'm sure that if you're reading this far, you're wondering how I handled it right?

I talked to the waitress and told her that I was irritated by the food and service. 

Me: y'all served us drinks that had a smooth 2-3 inches of water in it before you added the alcohol.

Her: I'm sorry.

When she brought out the receipt for payment, I was a little annoyed at the price and said \"this was seriously not good. I'm not one to complain about stuff but this is the cost and NOTHING was good?\"

Waitress: I paid for yalls coke.

And that's when I lost it.

So....right now, I'm standing at the door waiting for a manager. I'm sure he/she ain't gonna do sh*t and I'm gonna end up in Meck. County before the night is over.

I don't even want a refund, a discount, nothing. I just want him/her to see this face and understand that I absolutely am the type stand in their establishment and write a dissertation style Yelp review because I have time and type well over 90 words per minute.


UPDATE: the manager apologized for the whole deal. I definitely appreciate it but not enough to come back. Y'all have fun with that."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night and got seated right away. The drunken shrimp and bread pudding were delicious. However my catfish came out undercooked and was bland. The service is also very slow as we were there for almost 2 hours."}
{"text":"Horrendous....from top to bottom. I came with a party of 7, and every order had an issue. 
I ordered chicken and a sweet potato waffle, I received 2 wings instead of 3, and the wrong waffle. They returned with a sweet potato waffle and no wings. One person had ribs that were salty, and they're was the debacle of catfish and grits. They tasted the fish, then the grits that were cold. Had it sent back, it came with hot grits but the same piece of fish (that's the waitress had in her hand while she walked outside trying to chase the manager down who didn't want to come to our table and speak about our issues). That plate was sent back again and returned a 3rd time. Grits weren't good, had them exchanged for 2 sides. The syrup for the waffles was odd tasting, like a Ms. Butterworth's butter flavored that had been headed up. 
No attentiveness and accountability from management...promised to take off the catfish and grits, but said the owners charged us for 1/2 of it because sides were ordered and the plate was finished. 
WILL NOT return here. Ever. Again. For any reason. This reminds me of Rebecca's which is down the street on Harris...and they're terrible. I wouldn't recommend this place to children in a 3rd world country who we can feed for $.60 a day."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Charlotte really needs more restaurants like this.  I'm willing to give them a chance. They seem to bend over backwards in attempting to ensure a great experience. I'm in their corner 100%.  I was very impressed."}
{"text":"One lonely star because they are understaffed and poorly managed. I went here on a Saturday and despite there being several empty tables, the hostesses did not sit anyone at them. I watched 3 groups sit at empty tables around the bar area, only to be asked to move. I assume they didn't want to seat people there because they didn't have the staff to serve them. 

Additionally, the hostess wasn't particularly friendly and didn't ask for my name. Just said that she would find me when I was added to the wait list. We ended up leaving. 

I'm willing to give it another try, but if they haven't worked out the kinks yet, when will it happen? Nice venue and good live music."}
{"text":"First time at Bluenotes and was not happy.  We waited 15 minutes for our server to come and take our drink order keep in mind there were only 6 of us in the spot. I had ordered the creamy cheddar shrimp and grits and what I got was just plain grits with some butter sauce that the shrimp were cooked in, the mojito I ordered came with old dried mint and way to much liquor. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I visited here during my recent trip to Charlotte for Thanksgiving week. I was super hype to hear that it was a Louisiana style restaurant with live music, but after hearing it had recently opened I lowered my expectations somewhat and mentally prepared for some kinks.

Well, glad I did that because the kinks were plentiful - but the party at my table was incredible so it took my mind off of it. The gumbo came out quickly, but it wasn't hot. I was too hungry to complain and overall, it was tasty. The rest of the food took over an hour to arrive, but when it did, it did not disappoint. I suppose items are made to order. Not really realistic, in my opinion - but I believe these are things that can be worked out as time goes on....but the owners need to make some immediate adjustments."}
{"text":"Poor poor poor. Food was mediocre at best. They were hosting a special event and didn't have several things on the menu. The venue was far from packed and the service was still unbelievably slow. And of course...the artist didn't show and they provided no refunds. Will not return."}
{"text":"I went to this establishment on 12/3 to celebrate my friends husband birthday after being charged for entry which was refunded after realizing that our entry had already been paid. I purchasing a number of drinks and I was informed that food wasn't the good however I proceeded to order the burger well done and fries. The fries were ok however the burger was burnt. I informed the waitress and she went to get the manager. The female manager approached I told her my concerns how I didn't have a problem with paying for the fries but the burger was burnt in my opinion. She informed me that I ordered it well done and that is what I received. I attempted to explain to her that this is beyond cooked. It was at that point where she told me she was the general manager and she knows what I ordered. After that statement I said well I don't want it then - her response \"You may not want it but you going to pay for it\" and she walked away. As she walked away she stated to the waitress servicing the table \"Make sure you get her money and get her the out of her\". I've never encountered this low level of service in my life. I understand she may have not been the best of moods that night however an ideal response would have been to offer to prepare another burger. Never will myself or any of my friends enter that restaurant again."}
{"text":"I know,  I know,  they are new so I'm going to preface everything I say from this point on with that and let you be the judge... 

I decided to host my Bookclub there because I thought the theme of the restaurant was a great fit for the book we read,  The Great Gatsby.  As always,  I booked reservations.  I arrived 10 minutes early  so that I can decorate the table before the other ladies arrived (I'm extra like that).  I was greeted promptly but told that I was early and would have to wait for my table.  Looking around the restaurant was empty but I'm not a restaurant manager so... I,  and a few group members, ended up sitting there until 20 minutes after my reservation.  It wasn't until I asked how much longer when I was told,  \"oh,  your table is ready.  We were waiting for you.\"?????

We are seated,  decorated and ready to place our order.  But alas,  they are out of the one thing we all wanted to try,   what seemed to be their desired signature dish, the crabegg rolls.  We decide on wings instead which turned out to be a pretty good choice seeing how we didn't know at the time that was the most food we would be eating there.  

We ordered our drinks and entrées,  they were out of what one group member wanted.  Do you see a pattern emerging?  It gets better.  The drinks come in plastic \"toy\" cups, the kind my daughter and I use for her tea parties.  The entrées come in plastic cereal bowls.  These servings are not even nearly close to the size you'd expect for the prices they charged.  It was more like a sampling not a meal.  Cheddar biscuits were supposed to accompany our food however they ran out and had just put a batch in the oven.  It would be at least 20 minutes.  Our waitress asks if we'd like regular biscuits instead? Only to have to come right back out and say those were too old to serve.  We were done eating our sample bowls and needless to say my group is ready to go, making plans to meet at another restaurant to really eat, and here comes our server with a bowl of the driest,  saltiest (but hot)  biscuits I'd ever tasted. Why I thought I'd chance it and order dessert I'll never really know except that I'm a sucker for pecan pie. Perhaps I was praying that they could get this right. Well if you've read this review in its entirety by now I know you know what I was told.  Yep,  they were all out of the only dessert I cared to try from the menu. 

In her defense,  our server,  Marilyn, was spectacular!  I think she felt out pain.  She gave us coupons for a discount if we came back.  My group promptly passed them all back.  Guess that says it all huh?"}
{"text":"Food is Amazing... Grand Opening filled to capacity... Great atmosphere and the hostess and staff is very friendly... Come check it out come get your Blu's on!!"}
{"text":"Ribs where to tough to cut and eat.  Very dissapointed.  Server said she would tell chef.  Never gested to bring 
Another rack"}
{"text":"I drove from Uptown out this way because I wanted to try something new that wasn't in my neighborhood. Kind of slow for a Sunday afternoon. This is the type of place I was definitely expecting to be overcrowded by church goers who just got let out. Or non-church goers who were maybe just out. Could be due to location though. 

I ordered the fish and grits which was a nice change from the usual shrimp and grits offered throughout both Carolinas. I got a good size piece of fish, none of those wimpy nuggets. And a heaping serving of grits. Wish they would've melted the cheese in the grits. I like my grits extra cheesy and blended well together. Overall good dish and seasoned well enough so that it's not bland but won't kill those who have health restrictions which is hard to find lol.

Service was fast and friendly. My server was very pleasant and made sure I had everything I needed at all times. Despite the place being rather light on customers, I didn't see servers or other employees just hanging around like you normally do which is also nice.

This is the type of place my mother loves so I would definitely be back again when she visits."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for such a long time and I'm pretty sad that I was disappointed. I had such high hopes! 

Myself and 6 coworkers ate here on a Friday for lunch. It was pretty empty. 

Service was odd. You know when someone talks too damn much. Yes, that was my experience. The server even sat down with us and was talking. Now, I'm all about a good conversation but it was just awkward because we were having a farewell lunch. She even told us that her manager was throwing paper towels at her because they were so bored earlier.Eh, okay. 

They have have the same menu for brunch, lunch, and dinner and have restrictions to the menu depending on the times you dine in. I saw so many items that I wanted to try but unfortunately could not. Server told us that the food would come out half and half because the kitchen needed the tickets halved and would cook them one half at a time. She stated that the tickets would be too long and would set the kitchen on fire- what lol? Just a little weird. 

The food was disappointing. I ordered the half (6in) shrimp po boy. Shrimp was nicely seasoned but taste could have been stronger- it just tasted like normal fried shrimp. I also ordered the crab macaroni and cheese. Now, there is NO crab in it. They take the seasoned crab juices and put it in the macaroni and cheese for flavoring. It was definitely good but I won't be ordering again- if they put some crab in it that would make the dish delicious. 

3 other people ordered wings. 1 of them received the wrong type. Was told they were cold and we're just \"okay\". Another coworker got the shrimp po boy and ate it with no complaints. Another coworker ordered the andouille with red beans and rice. I was informed that the andouille was salty. My boss ordered the jambalaya and also informed us that hers was salty. The jalapeño cornbread reportedly had good flavor but was dry- it did not look moist whatsoever. 

They do give you a discount if you have a work badge which is nice for them to offer. 

The bathrooms are, eh. They do have an ATM if you do need it near the bathrooms. They have posters up of events that they hold but there is a cover charge for some of the evening events."}
{"text":"The food is not bad. The server had to confirm that half the food ON THE MENU was even available, and some wasn't. The service is terrible. The bread pudding is nasty. The music was nice though. Overall, not planning on coming back."}
{"text":"Basically what you'd expect from a blues bar in the suburbs of Charlotte. In other words, it's ok but we're not in the City of Chicago, New Orleans or Memphis so don't expect big things. The music was decent (but they only played for one hour total when two is advertised), the food was good as was the service. Ambiance average at best. Drinks were pretty bad . Definitely no professional mixologist at this bar. Finally, for some reason, there is neither Jambalaya or crawfish etoufee on this \"New Orleans\" menu."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars for food; however, the service was lackluster. The crowd is usually older (approx. late 30s+). Later in the evening, the attire is a little more like \"grown and sexy,\" but I wouldn't overdue it. 

Pros: 
The live band makes BluNotes' atmosphere jazzy and vibrant! It can get pretty noisy, but what do expect at a live music joint. There is a DJ who closes out the night after the live band.

The food was \"slap yo' Mama good!!\" I had the shrimp and grits. Oh - My - Lawd! Every bite was better than the first! The combination of the creamy sauce, grits, and perfectly seasoned shrimp made the meal phenomenal. It is a MUST TRY! 

The drinks are well-mixed and strong enough to make you groove with the music. 

Cons:
The wait was ridiculously LONG! The worst was the service which made the wait even longer. Their system seemed unorganized and they were not courteous. They had poor attitudes. Not to mention they were deceptive. They'd manipulate the wait time to entice you to pay the cover. Once you're in, you're stuck waiting. 

If you have reservations, they seem to seat you a little more quickly; however, you'll still wait a little while - depending your time of arrival. I'd recommend reservations. 

The cover charges vary depending on the artist/band playing for the evening. We went on a Saturday night when a Grammy Award Winning Musician was featured so we paid $15/person. While two weeks before they were only charging $5/person.

Overall, if you can scoop a deal on Groupon, don't miss it. The food is worth trying; however, brace yourself for the wait and the poor service of the entry staff."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Blu Notes. Our FIRST time trying the restaurant and we live across the street, less then a half of a mile away. 

Time quoted was 25-35 minutes. I checked on it once and was told 15 more minutes. 
The order took over an hour and a half. We finally found the driver at the neighbors, who was rude (I had specific directions on the order also). 

We got cold crawfish egg rolls, fries, shrimp po boy, and cold and very soggy okra and beignets. 

$60 with of cold and soggy food and late, rude delivery. 

The owner discounted the order a whopping 10% when we called the delivery service. I stressed this was not acceptable and she stated that was all they were willing to do. 

So much for good customer service!"}
{"text":"Ripoff. I purchased a groupon to go see a music set there. Utter trash. Due to having a 'general admission' ticket I was told I would have to find a seat at the bar or go sit outside on the patio. The tables inside were reserved for people who purchased VIP tickets. Mind you one of the wait staff people already seated me at a table, but because my wristband was the wrong color I was moved outside. The person that moved me said they would open the doors so I could hear the music. Really? I can go hear music anywhere in Charlotte for free! Especially if I'm buying food. This place is bootlegged. Please learn from my mistake and save your money. These people are con artists, and need to be out of business."}
{"text":"Just be aware of the community seating policy.  We made our reservations for my wife and myself over a week ago. got there tonight and were seated in a nice little booth  that if forced would seat four. We were then informed because of there community seating policy the next couple that came in would be sharing the booth with us.  Oh hell no. We made it clear that was not going to happen and they did not push the issue.  Just be aware. Food was fantastic though as was service.  But I will not be back if I have to share a table."}
{"text":"Authentic New Orleans cuisine great service and great ambience for the foodies who love down home nawlins food LOL just what Charlotte Needed."}
