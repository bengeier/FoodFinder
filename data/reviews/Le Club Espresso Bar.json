{"text":"I've never seen if before, but it is a great fusion of a bike shop and coffee bar. There's a spot for your bike at the entrance, so you can sit down and have some excellent coffee without any hassle. Coffee is top notch as well. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had one of the best cappuccinos in town here. So so smooth. Perfectly balanced bitterness. Not sour or acidic. Ah, fantastic !! My only problem was that the space can get extremely warm during a hot summer day. It's located in a half basement with minimum ventilation. It's a good place to chill but not a good place to study or work. Not enough outlets and it can get pretty dark inside. The place is also a bike repair store but the cafe and the store is separated by the architecture. The staff are very friendly, they even let me try my broken french when ordering. Bonus point: they have sandwiches too!"}
{"text":"Nice new Coffee shop that opened near my place

Very good espressos and friendly staff, a lot of passion went into this place and it shows.

Check it out :)"}

{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while looking for a nice coffee shop in the cold winter weather and I'm so happy I did ! Lovely space inside with modern and zen decor and friendly professional staff who really know how to make a great cappuccino ! perfectly smooth coffee with great flavour and a pretty design in the foam, one of the best I've had in the city :) we also had their green tea served in a diffuser and had really nice flavour. They also had a nice little selection of pastries available to choose from which I will definitely have to try for myself since they looked delicious. They also serve food as I did see a few people eating breakfast. Their prices are cheaper than Starbucks and second cup and the quality is well above. As a coffee lover I can definitely see myself coming back here many times!"}
