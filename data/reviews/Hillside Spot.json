{"text":"I always have good food when I come here. it's a great local place with a nice patio for breakfast. you have to have an open mind when coming here, as there are some \"unusual\" menu items, but the staff is always accommodating. it's great for breakfast and dinner!"}
{"text":"We frequent hillside spot and generally love it-  I do have to say however, that I have found the food to be pretty inconsistent. There are times when I order something that I've had before and it is completely different then the last time I had it.  I know a lot of people complain about the slow service but that is actually one of the things that I enjoy about this little kitschy place- it is laid back and my friends and I can go sit for hours.  The servers are great and friendly and I love the atmosphere- I would just love to see more consistency in the food."}
{"text":"The food is delicous, but a little pretentious for my taste. The crowd is a bit foodie-alternative which also was a little snooty for us to just chill out and relax. The service was a bit slow  None of us had the BBQ, but we smelled like it all day after leaving (it smells great in the restaurant) so I assume that it is quite good.  The ingredients are all fresh and locally sourced for the most part which feels good to purchase and good for the local economy.  All-in-all, not really my cup of tea, but a great asset for Ahwatukee for those who are looking for a local, fresh culinary adventure."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars if the device wasn't so terrible. If you go to eat there you can't be in a hurry or expect excellent service. There has been a time where my husband and I eventually got our own drinks. Even other regulars know you can count on amazing food and terrible service. But the food is amazing and keep bringing me back. It makes the lack of service all worth it. The carne asada torta is one oft favorites. And the Brooklyn chop is a great salad. I will always recommend eating here, even of you do have to get your own drink."}
{"text":"This  is my \"go-to\" place when I'm in town for breakfast. Great food, awesome long term staff, good gluten free options."}
{"text":"This place could be great, but needs a little improvement, especially on the weekends.  During the week, it's a terrific spot to grab a late breakfast, coffee, and even get a some work done on wi-fi.  You can order at the counter and they are pretty quick with bringing out your drinks & food.  Have ordered the granola, croque madam, oatmeal and a variety of espresso drinks, and all have been tasty.  Weekends, however, are a different story.  They are usually understaffed with servers (who are hard to pick out from patrons since there is no dress code to distinguish), and waiting 30 minutes just for a table to have a simple breakfast is not cool.  They don't have counter service on the weekends so you are at the mercy of waiting to be seated, and then waiting longer for order taking & food.  Been there a couple times for dinner, also very good, with the exception of getting old versions of the menu which have items they don't make anymore.  Loved their fresh halibut.  It doesn't seem that there is ever a \"manager\" there on weekends who could make sure the place runs well."}
{"text":"We expected a long wait after we read the reviews before heading over for breakfast on the 4th of July...great service! And great food. Farmer's omelettes, breakfast burrittos and pancakes. We were are really impressed! We look forward to going again. But, please... Don't let the secret out about this gem! LOL"}
{"text":"Great coffee, phenomenal pancakes, and the rest of their menu is delicious...but the service is lacking."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a laid back breakfast any day of the week. Staff is friendly & service is fast. Try the \"El Jefe\" omelet, great flavors and not too much food either...goldilocks would be pleased!"}
{"text":"This place needs to take some lessons in customer service. Hillside Spot is slow. It takes forever to get your food. I have been there 3 times, 1 time when they were busy and the other 2 when it was slow. Every time I had to wait over 15 minutes to order and over 30 for my food. I have worked in the restaurant businees for 30 years. I have never seen a restaurant so disorganized when they are busy. They need to have a manager on the floor taking care of things. I did not see one person in charge following up on problems. Chef Gordon Ramsey needs to save this place before it goes down the drain. The only reason this place is still in business is because there is no competition for it. Ahwatukee residents are desperate for a good local restaurant and they are willing to put up with bad service and cold food because there is nothing else around to compete with it. Good Luck on improving or just get out of of the business!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast Aug12, 2017. Took 30 minutes to get food. It was not hot when we got it. The server never came to refill coffee. Had to flag another server down. Also, didn't asked how the food was after we received it. We weren't the only ones with cold food. The customers next to us were saying the same exact thing. Food was mediocre. Coffee not hot either. Noisy place, but most are."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast spot. Sat outside, beautiful weather. Had a couple of eggs, bacon and toast, side of sliced avocados and tomatoes. Really good cappuccino."}
{"text":"Living in South Phoenix, we have to travel to get a larger selection of restaurants. We often go to Ahwatukee for dinner but for some reason we have missed this little gem. I was specifically looking for breakfast at 4pm and they serve breakfast all day. I ordered the special which was a light crepe, filled with creme fresh topped with fresh strawberries, bananas, blueberries, I had a pancake too which was served with whipped butter and a very nice thick syrup. Because its fall and it was 4pm, I also had the fall sangria. Light, apple cider flavor with fall spices it was very tasty. Our service was top rate and sitting outside was comfortable. Looking forward to trying more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner there last night.  Wait staff was okay, first as soon as we were sitting down was on us about what beer or wine, then when our final party joined us was asking what we wanted to eat.  Felt rushed..then poof she disappeared until the check was do.  With that out of the way,   I ordered the 1/2 chicken it was tasty as was the side salad.  The Macaroni Cheese was plain, nothing great about it so skip that.    My friends order the chicken salad the salmon, both were good.    Overall food and atmosphere was okay."}
{"text":"I love Hillside for breakfast and come whenever I can.  The meat they use is of a very high quality, and makes everything amazing. The Levain bread is really fantastic. Basically everything food related is great.  The problem, as many have noted, is in Hillside's service. I've had a number of servers who have been very good, so it's not a systemic issue.   But, that being said, there are a number of servers who are about as bad as it gets. They won't come to take your order until you've been there almost 15 minutes. They drop the food off and you'll never see them again unless you flag them down and almost yell to them. These folks aren't unfriendly, but they're also not exactly caring about your experience.  So, you're left with the feelings that I have: hope that Yelp gets the management weeds out the poor servers, so this place can be the 5 stars it should be."}
{"text":"I came to Hillside last night and I can't figure out what all of these positive reviews are about. I ordered the mesquite grilled chicken which came with two sides - I chose mac n cheese and stir fried veggies. First of all, they charge $4.75 for a side MAC N CHEESE out of a BLUE BOX, which should be a freaking crime. That is the kind of crap you find on a chain restaurant kids' menu... YUCK! Making a decent mac n cheese from scratch is not that hard, guys. The veggies were complete mush - nothing you would expect when you read \"stir fried veggies\". Last, there was the chicken. Sigh. There was some sort of goo that they slather on it - it is sticky sweet - and it condenses down as it cooks, then sticks to your teeth when you eat it. Oh yeah, the chicken was very, very pink close to the bone.   Maybe this is more of a breakfast place? Perhaps I just got unlucky and had three terrible things on the menu? In any event, it will be difficult for me to try this place again.  I still can't believe they serve Kraft mac n cheese and charge $4.75 for a side of it. Laughable."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. The staff is great. I have been there twice and had a great experience both times.  I will be back in the next few days."}
{"text":"Had dinner on the patio with live music last night and breakfast there this morning.  I have to say many of the bad reviews really piss me off.  Good food takes time people!  If you want fast and cheap, go to  McD's across the parking lot. The food here is better than anything else in Ahwatukee.  I don't mind waiting and the servers are relaxed and friendly.   Don't change a thing!  If the people who don't like it here stop coming, more great food and atmosphere for the rest of us."}
{"text":"I try to give a bussiness the benefit of the doubt, but I just can't do it anymore for this place. I have been here 4 times. Each time the service was crap. The first time I was here was on mother's day. I understand that places are busy on this day so I tried not to judge based on that visit. I went there 3 more times. Each time the place wasn't even busy! It takes forever for someone to notice you because it is a seat yourself type of place. At least it was everytime I was there. If you want a drink refilled you should order 2 drinks because it will take forever for someone to come back to your table. If you're not in any type of hurry and could care less about good service then come here. Good food but absolutely HORRIBLE service. I will never eat here again based on the service alone."}
{"text":"My wife and I and some friends went there a couple of weeks ago. Where do I begin? It took nearly 45 min. to get our food from the time we were seated, during which we had no drink refills. I ordered a burger medium rare which came darn near well done and completely flavorless. My wife had a ribeye sandwich. The flavor of the steak was smothered by some overpowering sweet, salty sauce or marinade which completely ruined it. My friend had macaroni and cheese and it was pretty similar to Kraft White Cheddar Mac and Cheese, but with far less flavor.   The only reason this place gets two stars is because of the bread that the sandwiches were served on was really good and the guacamole appetizer was a 4 out of 5.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had, food was wrong and cold this was the only time I have ever not paid for party of a meal due to it not being edible. I was with a group of five and only two of the orders came out right and they were very simple kids meals if the three remaining orders one was cold one was messed up and one was completely wrong sad to say I will not patronize this establishment again."}
{"text":"Seating service is always a little slow because they don't want to put too much pressure on the service staff.  So, sometimes you have to wait for no reason. Food is always good.  Nice breakfast spot for the weekends!  Good patio seating."}
{"text":"This place was great for breakfast.  Tried it for dinner and it was delicious.  I had the special halibut.  It was cooked perfectly and a nice piece of fish.   I love the ambiance of this place and the fact that they source local products.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The menu here is so eclectic that you might think it wouldn't be good but everything my party had was amazing! The waitress recommended the spicy tuna rice bowl and I am so thankful that she did because it was delicious. It was pretty much an unwrapped spicy tuna roll and came with a delicious side salad. I also ordered the special mac and cheese which came with chiles and chorizo and was so creamy and cheesy with a bit of spice. So good! Two of my dining guests ordered the ribs and noted that they fell off of the bone and were delectable. Two others got the pulled pork sandwich and spoke about its amazingness for the rest of the night. The service was amazing and the ambiance was great for a casual dinner. Definitely recommend. Everyone in your party will find food on the menu that they will like and to be honest I can't get that Mac and cheese off of my mind!"}
{"text":"The croque monsiuer (madame) and all their sopas are what I would reccomend for someone who wants to indulge in something fresh and flavorful without over indulging.  My girlfriend tried the apple compote pancakes which were disappointing. We were expecting pancakes topped with  an apple jam of sorts but the topping turned out looking like they just sliced some apples and put them on top. Very big letdown but still 4/5 because of other redeeming dishes and the atmosphere that makes you feel like you are eating at a place trying to stay secret. (AKA hipster.)"}
{"text":"Stopped in this am for a quick breakfast with my wife and 4 yr old. My little guy was being a crab, so we didn't get to truly enjoy it, but what we had was really good. We don't live all that close, but we would go again..."}
{"text":"Based on a review in PHX Magazine, I decided to stop by Hillside Spot for breakfast today.  Not a good choice.   I ordered Mia's Pancakes, a blackberry muffin, and regular coffee.  The muffin was good, but not spectacular.  The coffee was bad - it tasted metallic and \"off\" for lack of a better word.  Then my pancakes arrived...they were large, but not tasty.  The pancakes were too eggy, soggy, and SALTY!  It was bizarre.  I ate three bites and then left.   I don't know if I was there on a bad day, but it was terrible and I was very surprised since it received good reviews."}
{"text":"Hipster alert!!!  I went there recently with the intention of getting a salad. Unfortunately I couldn't find anything that resembled one.  All of them included fruit (i.e. pears, mango) and a list of exotic ingredients, including dressings such as jalapeno cucumber raspberry vinaigrette (come on). It would seem that this place is trying way too hard. It's one thing to offer new foods and exciting twists on traditional stuff, but it's another to just throw together a bunch of unique-sounding ingredients in hopes to dupe the next bohemian with an identity crisis into overpriced mediocrity.  If the hipsters of Ahwatukee would just get over themselves this place wouldn't be all that popular."}
{"text":"The spot chop salad is my favorite.  They also have a great pulled pork sandwich.  They buy from local vendors, so I like to support them.   The restaurant is open and urban.  The service is not there strong suit, but give them a try."}
{"text":"I have come here many times and want desperately to support the local ahwatukee commerce and small business owners... I have been seated on the patio almost every time which is fine, however I would offer several suggestions: 1. Clean the patio up There is so much junk at the back of the patio that it looks like bulk pick up is late picking up.  Not so bad if there weren't tables directly next to these items.    2. Get rid of the flies At the time of this report there are 7 flies sitting on our table alone.  There so comfortable on this patio that they are too lazy to fly around- they live here.  It is a constant problem and again highlights that the patio is unacceptably dirty.  Again, clean it up.  3. Change your menu even slightly. The food is good and there is potential. Would be nice to add variety.  Although I cannot recommend hillside spot secondary to the above reasons, I hope that they can do these necessary improvements to survive."}
{"text":"I know I only gave this spot 3 stars, but here's why. I come here almost every Sunday after hiking south mountain. It has fantastic lattes, way better than Starbucks, and the food is delicious too. However, the prices here are way too high for the amount of food/drink you get, and the service can occasionally be slow, depending on how busy it is. They do not handle busy times well, although they are much better than they used to be. The most disappointing thing about this place is that they no longer allow dogs in their nice side patio, so after my hike with my dog, I have to sit near the front door which downgrades my experience a bit. I still go here frequently despite all of the above as it really is a decent place for breakfast. Btw the mimosas are to die for!"}
{"text":"NOT A HIPSTER = NOT WELCOME!! Stand-offish staff of world weary 20 year olds. Can be 10% full and customers ignored. (Today there were 3 other tables with people). I'm *always* kind with servers, they have a difficult job. However, my server today came up to my table with the worst attitude I've ever had in a server.   Now she gets some kudos for making the effort to walk over to my table. However, her face indicated that I was obviously intruding on her. I politely asked her to repeat what she said b/c I could not hear her (like a lot of other people, I sometimes have a little trouble hearing with background noise. Plus she was kind of standing behind me and not really talking to my face).   I'd obviously crossed the line--this was going to require 10 seconds of her time. She got really sharp with me, rolled her eyes, sighed, etc. I was frustrated & was rude in return, which is completely out of character for me. Went in for some quiet time after work, left with a knot in my stomach.  I wanted so badly to like this place, I've tried it 5-6 times over the years. Probably stay in business b/c of morons like me. No more. Service/attitude consistently bad. Very, very, very unwelcoming, no eye contact, smiles--you know, things that come naturally to most folks.  The reviews indicate that service has been an issue for years. Given that they are doing nothing to improve it, I can only hope they go out of business so a more deserving business can use the cool little space.  NOTE TO PERSONS WITH SERVICE ANIMALS: You may wish to read a review further down indicating that an individual's service dog was not welcome here."}
{"text":"No matter how good the food is or how awesome the drinks are... It comes doesn't to service..   15 min wait to get two coffees???  Too slow IN my opinion.   I'll look elsewhere from here on out"}
{"text":"I want to love this place, but as many before me have written, the service is some of the worst that I have ever had. It's as if the servers feel like they are doing you a favor by bringing your food and drink. The shame of it is that the food is really good. We would go to the Hillside a lot if the service were even just a little better. Oh well."}
{"text":"Nice patio"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat in Ahwatukee.  I love how they use a lot of locally sourced ingredients.  Everything that I've tried on the menu has been good.  I highly recommend the Asado Chicken Salad, the Suki Rice Bowl (with spicy tuna), the pulled pork sandwich & the corn on the cob. Lots of bottled craft brews to pick from and some local brews on tap.  Great spot for breakfast too.  I like the coffee and iced teas here...."}
{"text":"Here's the thing... The food is amazing, but the service is hit or miss. I've vowed never to come back many times. The food (and my kids' love of it) always brings me back. Get the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Normally the Hillside Spot is on point. Disappointingly that was not the case this evening. We we're meet at the door by a rude \"dude bro\" I have never seen before who told us the kitchen was closed. I say that I have never seen him before because. We eat there almost every Sunday morning after our group runs and again on Thursday nights. The funny thing is we had to walk across the parking lot and place our order at zips and post this before 8 p.m. The time they are supposed to be closing! Time to rethink our post run dinning choice."}
{"text":"this should have no stars... they have nothing traditional, no french toast , no corn beef hash, etc.. I asked for 2 eggs with the yellows juicy and the whites cooked (no boogers). he said over medium. i said ok, I asked for bacon and sour dough bread with butter. My eggs came out over hard no juice and my bacon burn, the toast was hard burnt and cold so could not absorb the butter.  I would never recommend this place to anyone other than my inlaws!!0 forgot to tell you about the coffee I had to ask three times for a refill and each time it was cold.. he actually touched my mug and i told him to taste it as it was cold... should have poured it on ,me to prove to him...."}
{"text":"Have stopped at Hillside several times after hiking South Mountain for coffee and scones.  Noticed they had \"Friday Fish Fry\" on menu. Decided to try.  What a mistake. Very bland, not seasoned fish, soggy French fries.  Decided to try on Sunday for breakfast. Say hostess at front desk preparing silverware in containers.  She held knives, forks and spoons by the hilt or fork tines, spoons not by handle and placed in containers.  She also pressed silverware against her clothing and ran he fingers through her hair while sorting the silverware. Hopefully the Health Department will catch this some day.  I will no longer eat anything there that requires silverware. David A. Gilliland  P.S. Breakfast was fairly tasty."}
{"text":"Service, salad, beers, and burgers! All aspects were perfect. Great outdoor patio, and our server Alex gave perfect recommendations for dinner. Brunch is what HS is known for, but dinner is where it's at!!! Can't wait to try all of the other dishes!!"}
{"text":"An oasis of real food in the chain-restaurant wasteland of Ahwatukee/south Tempe.  The service can be slow and not all the dishes for everyone the table come out at the same time, but the food it worth it when it arrives. Fresh ingredients without fancy twists serves them well.  I recommend the grilled salmon."}
{"text":"Open kitchen and great staff. Friendly and chilled.  Turkey sandwich. Sliced white breast havarti cheese, avocado, tomato lettuce mayo and honey mustard. With salad. And a hefeweizen."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast & lunch place in Ahwatukee. The food is excellent. The service is friendly and they do what they do perfectly. This isn't a place to go for elegant sit down service. It's the perfect blend of self-service meets top restaurant quality food.   Have the Croque Monsieur--or add an egg to make it a Croque Madame. You will not be disappointed. The bread and the baked goods are so good you could make a substantial meal off them alone.  Finally, this is a small local business that truly cares about its community. They have shown up at two community fund raising events with huge boxes of warm, freshly baked cookies to donate. I'm grateful to have a place of this caliber in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Between the friendly wait staff to their fantastic pancakes and Mexican inspired food, this is a winner. Try it."}
{"text":"Great cafe with friendly service. We enjoyed the \"el gallo\" torta. & almond coffee cake on the perfect shaded patio.  My wife and I really enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and great eats.  Can't wait to try the Spot for dinner!"}
{"text":"Hillside spot is a great place for lunch. I have been there twice. First time I had the burger, which was juicy and everything I needed to cure my hangover. The second time I went for a healthier option and got the suki rice bowl - holy cow was I blown away. Perfect size and tasty! It comes with a small salad which was also very good. My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich which had a really good smokey flavor. Besides from the food, we had the best server I have had in awhile. Her name is Erica. She was fast, nice, charming, and on top of her game. I can't wait to come back and try hillside for dinner!"}
{"text":"I've only been for breakfast and it is delicious. Coffee is fabulous.  Be prepared to wait for a table on the weekends.  Can get a bit loud so sitting outside is ideal, when possible."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Friendly wait-staff. \"Free\" kids meals never seem to be free until you ask for a receipt adjustment. \"Happy hour discounted\" drinks rarely seem to be discounted... until you ask for a receipt adjustment. And careful with ordering any sort of substitutions - this place is happy to charge extra for a similar (or lesser) side. If you're one who rarely bothers to check your bill, maybe rethink that approach when coming here."}
{"text":"Hillside Spot is awesome! I have only been here a couple times but the food and service haven't disappointed! The first time I sat inside and the second I sat out on the patio. I'd say the patio was my favorite, lots of shade and the service didn't lack. I've enjoyed both breakfast and lunch here and both have been great! I'm looking forward to trying out their happy hour on Thursdays next!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is GREAT! I love the open kitchen. They use many local products and I have tried the entire breakfast menu. It is not a huge menu but what is on it is very high quality. Can't get enough! Coffee is sometimes cold, but I still give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Cool breakfast/brunch/lunch place! They do dinner too though! Went for breakfast one morning with the hubby. Great breakfast sandwiches! A little slow on service, however the staff are friendly and helpful. They serve local beer and wine too. We will have to go back and try dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"From the roasted corn, to the carne asada burrito to the savory crepe and the croque madame  you cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"This place used to be relaxing with much better food and service. Tables are always sticky, dirty floors, the only bathroom is old and disgusting, flies are always flying around inside and because of the dirty stuff and droppings outside, they're there as well. Service is the worst I have seen. Every time we go there, we hope that they have improved but it just gets worse. Manager may not be aware of his crew but that's his job! As the last straw, we actually left after being seated and waited for over 35 minutes for anyone to step up and even ask if we need anything to drink or have any silverware on the table. I am sure we won't be going back and hopefully they step up their service."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in the Valley, even at 3 in the afternoon on a Saturday.   Fantastic prices on the a la carte menu. I can get a large, delicious pancake, a side of hash browns, and coffee for under $7.   Wait staff is always rotating, but consistently friendly. Service is a bit slower on the patio than in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I really really want this place to be good.  We have so few good 'mom and pop' places in Ahwatukee and I had such high hopes for Hillside Spot. It has a funky ambiance, friendly staff, beautiful patio, and great neighborhood location, however, I am often so disappointed.   I met friends for coffee last week.  We sat in the corner at a wide wooden table with chairs.  Our waitress quickly greeted us and was very friendly.  It was 8am so I was eager for coffee.  It was lukewarm, watered down, lacked flavor, and not good.    I am happy with Circle K coffee and Hillside's was just plain bad. If they could make a good cup of coffee and compete with Dunkin Donuts and all the chains that plague Ahwatukee it would be a public service!   As for the food, I opted for an eye-catching pastry.  I chose a blueberry muffin.  It was dry and cold.  My friend ordered a scone and was also disappointed. I have been here about 4 times since they have opened but have been rarely pleased.  Sad to say I don't think I will give it a try again soon. It's just too heartbreaking.  Please Hillside Spot! Step it up!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for breakfast while in Chandler. Delicious southwest breakfast - chorizo torta, chorizo burritos.  Healthy options as well - Steel Cut Oatmeal with fresh fruit and a selection of toppings.    This place was pretty good for dinner as well;  they have a decent craft beer selection on hand.  Staff was very friendly, and attentive to us."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and generally the food is pretty good. They have a lot of options for all diet types and a good beer selection. I like to get the Spot Chop salad and also have enjoyed the veggie torta. My meat eater friends like the burgers or Reuben sandwich.   The only downside is the service can be a slow even if they are not very busy. I also have been seated at a table that was not cleaned off since the previous customer and found food residue from a previous dish on my plate."}
{"text":"The Hillside is close to my home and makes a nice walk with the family to go there for lunch/brunch. The food there is really good and I believe almost all food  is gathered from local growers.  I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo, eggs, cheese and potatoes. The burrito was flavorful and very good. There is also a small side of fruit served with the meal. I wish the fruit was a bit bigger.  I had a bite of my wife's torta sandwich and that was really good. That might be an option next time.  There is a nice patio outside with a fireplace as well as ample seating inside.  Service was great and food came out quickly! We'll be bake there over and over sampling other items.  Nice atmsophere that is also kid friendly."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Service was awful. We barley saw our waiter and the bus boy took our waters from us when we had finished but were still talking."}
{"text":"You'd think, wouldn't you, that with a name like Hillside Spot this restaurant in Ahwatukee would be nestled in a pastoral setting with lovely views? Not so, it's in a typical strip mall off Warner Rd. and unfortunately its patio faces directly on the street, making it hard to carry on a conversation, even on a Sunday. The patio, without misters, is uninviting, with a very odd mixture of seat cushions for the wrought iron furniture. It was even more off-putting because most of the tables were loaded with dirty dishes. There was one hard working busboy who couldn't keep up with the mess. It wasn't much better indoors - messy and noisy (the noise of the cars being replaced by very loud music).       You place your order at the counter. Breakfast is served daily from 6:30 AM to 4 PM. There are pancakes, plain or with apple compote ($6) or with bananas, caramel, creme fraiche and peanuts ($7).  Eggs, scrambled or fried, come with MJ toast and a choice of bacon, ham, sausage, or chorizo ($6).  Various egg sandwiches and omelets range from $6 to $8. But we had come for lunch. The selection was small, and not particularly inspiring. Tuna or chicken salad sandwiches ($7), turkey ($6), a BLT to which you could add a fried egg at no extra charge ($7) and a croque monsieur ($7.50). Surprisingly, none of these came with a side. The cheeseburger ($8.50) came with fries.       I ordered the rotisserie half chicken ($10) which was served with fries and seasonal local vegetables. Of course, I requested crispy fries. Ken opted for the Derby Salad, with various greens, egg, avocado, bacon, and blue cheese, served with house made buttermilk dressing ($8). We waited quite a while, when finally a server, shouting our name and number, delivered our food. The salad was good size, with loads of blue cheese chunks of good quality (rather than the generic crumbles served at many places), and large pieces of bacon. The greens were fresh and the avocado looked freshly cubed. It's a shame that the buttermilk dressing was tasteless, and the quantity skimpy. My chicken was nicely cooked, with crisp skin - much crispier, in fact, than my fries which were dark brown, but limp. The vegetables were a mix of roasted cauliflowerets, corn, and red peppers which I enjoyed.  We took home a brownie and a slice of chocolate cake. Both were excellent.       All in all, although our food was generally good, I had expected more. More ambience, a nicer setting, a more interesting menu. One of the owners of Hillside Spot also owns Gallo Blanco, a Southwestern/Mexican restaurant (our favorite) in the Clarendon Hotel in downtown Phoenix,. That menu, while small, is full of interesting, flavorful food. The place is clean, the decor \"bus station\" funky. It is, however, LOUD, especially when the Flamenco dancers are in attendance. Unfortunately, the limp fries are there too. So, while we will continue to eat at Gallo Blanco, Hillside Spot is off limits for us."}
{"text":"I came for the fries since it was listed as top 20 places to get them in AZ. Sadly, I was disappointed. The article I read claimed the fries had the perfect balance of crispy outside, fluffy inside. Mine were limp and uninspired. I probably went through half a bottle of ketchup to eat them. I got the grilled cheese as well- meh. The fun part was the surprise chunk of bacon and four pieces of shaved lettuce in my fries. It was almost as if they dumped someone's leftover fries on my plate. Wouldn't have minded, but I don't eat pork :/  Nice staff but super slow!  I sat, starving, while I watched the people that arrived and ordered after me, happily stuffing their faces.   All in all, not worth the drive nor the wait. Sadly, I will continue to hunt for the perfect fries in AZ."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a local place, that uses organic local produce, this is the place for you. Everything I've tried there has been delicious. They had baked mussels one night as their local fish dish, and they were AMAZING!   I like to make a lot of my own food, so I really like it when I can find a place that you can tell used fresh ingredients. Definitely try the guacamole!  They also have  a few beers on tap, and live music I think once a week. Saturdays maybe? I haven't checked that out yet.  They also serve Cartel Coffee Lab roasted coffee so this is a great spot to stop off and get your caffeine fix.  4 stars because I have seen, and heard, a few things about bad service. It can at times, feel like things aren't running as smoothly or quickly as they should be. Nothing strong management couldn't correct."}
{"text":"I've been her far more times than I've checked in.  Had the Blue Sky burger today.  Highly recommended!  They have a great happy hour and a beer selection on the same level.  It's the season to sit outside and they have a great patio!  Great place to bring your co-workers and / or friends after work."}
{"text":"The only reason I come here is because of my friend who likes this place. The ambience reminds her of LA, where she's originally from, so I don't want to argue about that.  This place can be busy especially on a weekend so prepare to wait for a table for 10-15 minutes. The food is good and service isn't too bad. I am only giving them 3 stars because their menu can be deceiving. There is usually mayonnaise on their sandwich but that is not written on their menu at all. A lot of people aren't into dairy like my fiancee! When we complained about that and wrote them an email about it, there was no response from their customer service. I guess they're too busy to respond to our email.  I will come back to this place only because my friend likes it but I know there are other places out there who take care of their customers and are honest and upfront about what they put on their food!"}
{"text":"Love Hillside Spot! I typically do weekend brunch or a late lunch and the food has always been good."}
{"text":"I've been to Hillside Spot a handful of times. The food has always been good, occasionally great! I love the vibe and the feel of the place, and like most, really want to support the local businessman! I agree with others...it is hard to get the rhythm down (where to get your silverware, napkins, drinks, etc.) the first couple of times...so be prepared (unless you come for the dinner service, where they actually seat and serve you). Their french fries are fantastic. One major downside are the flies (which were in full force my last visit).   Overall, definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Great place! Everything is locally sourced and the ambiance is delightful. Our server Madeline was wonderful and very attentive! The food was subpar but still good. When there was an issue with our order they were nice enough to comp it and express their apologies. I will definitely be returning!   Update as of 03/11/17 Lovely place!!! The bacon and cheese burger was fantastic and our sever Erik was very nice and attentive. He was kind enough to scour the restaurant for mustard for me. Fantastic food, fantastic service. 10/10 would recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Went for a simple breakfast Monday morning, and we're very pleased. There was no wait, and food came out promptly. Food was tasty and we ate it all."}
{"text":"I liked this place.  We went for breakfast and I had an egg and sausage dish on a roll.  Really didn't like the roll at all, but what was inside was great (didn't need all that bread anyways).  We sat outside and I really want to go back at night with the fireplace going and listen to some music.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's hard to review this place because they are all over the place. The layout needs a facelift. So random. Staff always looks stoned or hung over. I guess I blame that on poor management. I want to like the overall idea of the place and I welcome independent restraunts with creativity but this place needs help. I was really grossed out when I saw a server drag his 3' dreads (open kitchen) through some food.."}
{"text":"We go sometimes 3 times a week. Put up with the sometimes, not super fast service, it is a great place with no frozen food or microwaves. It's real food! Plus the beer and wine selections are the best. We love this place and the people there. The tukee would suffer without this spot!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh locally sourced food - reminds me of Panera. Super friendly staff. Check out their great happy hour!  Just had a weekly special summer salad with grilled chicken, romaine, apples, orange, grapes, strawberries and pecans with a strawberry dressing. They smoke their own meat. The smoked brisket burrito is a special expiring the end of this week and I will be back to try it!"}
{"text":"I've had a bit of a roller coaster ride with this place but I loved the highs so much I kept going back. I'm so glad I did... I had a few questionable take out experiences and once my order hadn't even been started when I showed up 15 minutes after I called?? Everyone just kind of stood around and looked at me confused. Anyway that was about 2 years ago.... Recently everything has been spot on ;) I'm such a huge huge fan of every salad I've had from here. My go to's are the derby and spot chop salad. Also have enjoyed the burgers, veggie sandwich, and pancakes. Food has never let me down and the new management (I think Omar) seems to have turned the place around! Currently loving it....!!"}
{"text":"I guess I am not the first one to state that service is awful in this great place. The food is consistent, and the fact that is is a local place, using local product is what made us come back over and over. But today was just a disaster. Waiting for someone to approach your table for 10 minutes, to finally have this waitress whose face loudly shows \"I hate my job, I would rather be dead than being here\" is a huge turn off. We love this place and went there to see if we could organize a brunch for 20 people; but after today's experience, I would be embarrassed to bring anyone there. I realized after reading other reviews on Yelp that I am far to be the only one complaining about service, and am wondering when changes will occur. There are other local businesses around where I can spend my money. Needless to say, the $1 tip I left today was way too much for the \"service\" received. Management: retrain your staff, be more selective in the hiring process, and teach them how to put a smile on their face."}
{"text":"Always crowded on Sunday and at lunch time! Good service and their burgers are delish!"}
{"text":"Portions could be bigger and coffee is expensive.   Pluses are that the pancakes my dad had are comparable to Matt's Big Breakfast and you don't have to wait for 2 hours for them. The outside seating is adorable and the homestyle fries are good. My mom hit the nail on the head though with this sandwhichy eggy thing with avocado. The bread and everything else about it was delic. I am excited for them to refine their menu a little bit and then this will become an Ahwatukee gem! We need more of them!!!!"}
{"text":"Hillside Spot is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are fantastic. I have selected items from all over the menu and have not been disappointed. They use high quality ingredients and source from local vendors, which, for me, is a big selling point.  For breakfast I would recommend the croque madame, farmer's omelette, or if you are looking for something sweet, their pancakes are some of the best I have had.  For lunch/dinner I feel that it is pretty much mandatory to order the guacamole as a starter. Basically all of their salads are great, but the real stand out is the Spot Chop. The meat for their burgers is ground in house and they cut their own fries, so you can't go wrong there. I have also been known to order the vegetable torta a time or two.   They also have a great Mexican food menu, which I have only ordered from once, but that one order happened to be one of the best Carne Asada burritos I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Went this morning.  Ordered a ham torta sandwich and coffee.  You have to order sides as an extra but the sandwich alone filled me up and I was only able to eat half!! The coffee was great and I mentioned it to our server.  \"IT'S CARTEL COFFEE\"  well that's WHY!!!!!!!!!!!! omg I love Cartel and so stoked this place is right by our place!  The scene is hipster and service is slow like the servers \"just work there, but don't really need the money sort of way\".  Still- ill go back- and be patient, because the food is good and the coffee is bomb and its close to my house."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at Hillside Spot. The atmosphere is great. It has the perfect mixture of traditional and modern in a laid back setting. Even better, the food here is amazing. It always tastes fresh, flavorful, and ultimately delicious. I am a fan of the burgers, myself, so I highly recommend those. Also, the wait staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, perfecting the dining experience."}
{"text":"Hillside also has great dinner and lunch meals. The mesquite chicken is delicious, they have really good Mexican food, plus great sandwiches and a plethora of interesting salads that are healthy and taste delicious. I love the atmosphere, the wine and beer list, the outdoor seating, the pulled pork sandwich, the fries, there is a lot to like about Hillside. I just wish they would stay open later. 8 p.m. even on a weeknight is too early to close."}
{"text":"This place needs improvements in so many areas! Our experience was very similar to some of the other reviews. We went there for breakfast on a Saturday morning. There was plenty of open tables when we got there, but we were still had to wait 10-15 minutes to get seated. The hostess explained to us that the cooks were 'catching up' on the orders and that's why we had to wait. When I asked if she could just seat us and take our order 10-15 min later, she looked completely confused and said, \"uh...I...don't know...I was told not to seat anybody\". So there was a bunch of other people just standing there, waiting, and you could see they getting frustrated by this too.  We finally go seated and the waitress got our order, she was nice, but took a long time to come back after she took our drink order. We waited at least 20 minutes to get our food. When the food finally arrived, we were not impressed at all! My husband got the El Jefe Omelet, it looked soooo good on the menu, but he was very disappointed. We paid $8.50 for a below average omelet with 1 slice of toast. They charge extra for sides like home potatoes...most restaurant places we go to include the toast and potatoes with your meal, especially when you pay that much! So yeah, their prices are not the best, especially for the quality and quantity of food. I got the El Gallo Torta, and it was OK. We also paid $3 for 1 egg and a slide of toast for our son, and never got a refill on our coffee. This place has potential, I like their concept, but they need A LOT of improvement if they want to keep customers coming back. I know we won't be back after our disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Normally, I don't like coming here because the service is so slow but I was very happy last night. Madison was our server and she rocked it. We had some salads and desert and couple of beers. Food is always good here but the service is typically slow. If all the servers were like Madison I'd be there all the time."}
{"text":"Food was great- had a Croque Madame. Sat outside, but flies were TERRIBLE! You literally couldn't stop waving your hand or one would land on your face or food. I looked around, they were everywhere, even inside. I realize we're outside but really, something could be done I think- or at least an apology for them.   Bathrooms are okay- no seat covers.   Great art hanging on the wall!"}
{"text":"We've been there for breakfast and dinner. Can't argue w/ the good reviews as we haven't experienced anything wrong yet. It's our neighborhood joint so we welcome it w/ open arms."}
{"text":"I come here for the Asado Salad which is one of the better salads out there imo. I'm surprised by how diverse their menu is and eventually I would like to try all of it. Service is always very friendly."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, people watching is superb, the jams are always fresh. Being so close to me I always want to claim it as \"My Spot\" but there is consistently a problem....The service sucks. They just can't seem to get it right! I always want to give them another try and every time I do, I get let down.  If you don't have a group and are willing to wait a bit with the possibility of your order being messed up, I would suggest Hillside."}
{"text":"Hillside spot is a much needed breath of fresh air in chain-ridden Ahwatukee.  I know there's some local mom and pops in the area but they all seem to be Italian.  Hillside is a top quality fast casual restaurant serving locally sourced and environmentally friendly products.  The service is always really friendly.  I've been coming here since they opened and I've seen them grow over the last few months.  I'm so glad they're here. It's a great place for breakfast, lunch or a quick dinner.  It's fun to sit at the bar and watch the kitchen at work. Their retail area is cute but doesn't offer a wide selection.  This doesn't bother me since I'd rather see more tables than retail space!  They offer a variety of sandwiches, salads, baked goods, and mesquite rotisserie chicken (yum!).  Indoor and outdoor seating is available."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it..... The food is ok. Service was lacking. From the first moment the waiter only bothered to take drink orders from 3 of the 4 of us. Then the food order came; one of the orders was wrong and the response was  \"You don't want it?!\"  You don't want this meal you did not order? No we wanted what we ordered.   Disappointed is really where I am on this one. Oh and the chop sticks my wife got with her meal was actually just a chop stick, yep just one stick.   Maybe they will upgrade the staff or teach some manners. Either one would be better than where they are now."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting the Hillside Spot and it was amazing!  The atmosphere is very comfortable and inviting. I built my own breakfast burrito which came with a side of slides bananas, strawberries and blueberries. The roasted salsa that came in the burrito was so good I ordered another side and ate all of it.  I will be back to eat my way through the menu."}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars because the food is pretty consistent and good, but the service is soooooo bad. Not  just a little bit bad, but a LOT bad. We have been several times and I think we have had one good experience."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant/cafe in 'Tukee. Great selection of various dishes. I recently went there for breakfast and had the breakfast burrito. It was delicious!! It was a little tangy, but, perfect taste. Great service and atmosphere weather you go there for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow, good find. Everything we ordered was delicious. They have some amazing bread they get from a local bakery, it's a cross between sourdough and french. You must try this grilled with butter!!! Carne asada sandwiches with avocado-amazing. Mesquite chicken sandwiches, tender-flavorful chicken with the amazing bread. Shrimp and chorizo appetizer-strange but the shrimp tasted so fresh. Guacamole and chips, I've never tasted better-anywhere! You have to visit this place and give them a try!"}
{"text":"Food is great, atmosphere is fun and \"young\". Only thing I hate is the service is always slow...everyone is nice and friendly, but we never come here when we are in a rush..."}
{"text":"The food was great.  Everything seemed to be locally sourced and prepared in-house.  We went when during a quiet time of day and so we didn't experience the slow service that other reviewers comment on.  I will definitely go back for a casual meal."}
{"text":"Been here several times, I'm done and am not impressed at the food OR the service( service is usually really bad) and food had varied, however ive had my last bad experience there today. Don't waste your money here.. it's not worth it."}
{"text":"First time there last w/e. Lots of cool looking staff in chef shirts sitting around..only saw two actual people working. Both doing the cooking and prep. The rest of the staff seemed busy palnning and enjoying sitting at the counter while I watched two customers walk in and out without being welcomed..let alone served. If you don't know to go to the counter and order your going to wander around since everybody seems to busy doing who knows what to give EXCELLENT customer service. Look folks, I don't care how good your food or fancy your place is...if you don't meet and greet and provide first class customer service..you ain't gonna be around long. And don't let any other successful restaurants I hear you have mean your a lock at this place. The food was ok...but watching the staff ignore customers is inexcusable. I sure hope you get off your high horses and start welcoming everyone that walks thru the door and ask \"is this your first time here\" Then give them the drill......trust me, you ain't to big or too important to fail. I'll give this place one more try........you need to warm up the sterile atmosphere....you could learn a lot from Liberty market which seems to be the concept your emulating."}
{"text":"Hillside Spot is spot-on perfection!   First time visiting for brunch this morning & the experience was seamless from start to finish.   Super busy but the wait for a table was not super long.   My nonfat latte was a treat for the eyes & the taste buds! The El Jefe omelet with sourdough toast was a great combo of meat & veggies - not too heavy and perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend raved about his peach green iced tea & banana pancakes.   Our only note is our waitress took quite a while to bring our check at the end of the meal, but she was covering several tables."}
{"text":"I want to love this place!  I hate giving two stars.  Lets start with the pros...  Good coffee Great scones They've done a good job on the environment Staff is friendly  on to the cons...  the review below describes a lunch take out order  Serving staff does not have a snap to it attitude, little to relaxed, stood at counter waiting to order take out for about 5 minutes prior to cashier who waled past me three times even acknowledged me.  Food was mediocre pushing bad.  Ordered the croque monsieur.  How do you screw this one up?  Let me tell you how, the bread was good, sliced too think, and burned around the crust.  The bechamel sauce must have been put on with a fire hose, way to think.  Too top it off the cheese layered on top, was also burned, not lightly golden, black burned.  This sandwich was severally out of balance and tasted poorly.  The chicken was OK.  It had a nice smoky grill flavor.  It was moist.  Here's the rub, the skin was burned,  I like a nice char as much as anyone, however the skin was burned.  The asparagus was very good, had a nice grilled flavor.  The french fries were not good, floppy and not nearly crisp enough.  My overall impression is this place has potential.  Good ambiance, good menu.  Winning comes down to execution and so far i give that a poor rating.  Sorry guys, I do believe in second chances so I will try again."}
{"text":"A classic case of Jekyl & Hyde...the food is great, i've ordered several items off the menu and each one was great.  Ambience is great as well.  Front of the house team is less than stellar.  Wait time at the cash machine is way too long, communication (like get your coffee here, get your water/iced tea there...) was weak, and method of delivering food also chaotic.  i think some strong management would go a long way with that place and i hope it does.  Too many entities have failed in that location and i don't want this to be one."}
{"text":"Ok, I want to love this place, seriously! It's a very cool atmosphere and the food, for breakfast and lunch, is pretty good. Dinner is more like lunch so don't go unless you want a sandwich or something lunch-like for dinner.  The problem with this place is the poor customer service. I have been a regular for a year and a half so you'd think someone would notice me, say hi like they recognize me or do anything to make me feel like they appreciate all my business. Unfortunately, NO!! I honestly feel like a new patron every single time I go here. Never once has anyone said one word to me like \"good to see you again\" or \"how are the kids\"...it's a major fail for a local business not to do this really simple thing. So, please, if you read this (and based on their track record, I'm assuming they don't monitor any social networks) can you train your staff to be warm and welcoming to match the decor. While I like this place, I will be coming here much less due to the poor customer service."}
{"text":"This place was great. I ate there for the first time the other day and I was very happy with my breakfast burrito selection. It was not too much food, just right. I was also excited that you can add hash browns to your burrito for $1. The coffee is really great too!"}
{"text":"I'm not feeling the love here. Went to Hillside on the recommendation of a friend that lives nearby and loves the place. I would love it more if it was my local caf. We went on a Sunday morning, knew there would be a crowd but the wait in line wasn't long and we had a table right off.  The entire line stopped while the order taker bagged up the to go portion of my order, my friends pie to go ordered at the same time took over an hour to get to the table. What was that? the food is good the portions large. They can't afford to get a number system for the tables? A wait person stood behind the drinks station/bar bellowing my name. not even stepping around. I had to stand up and holler  because I COULD NOT FIND THE PERSON WHO HAD MY FOOD. The food was nice but living in the east valley I wouldn't drive cross town to eat here again."}
{"text":"One star for the quality of food, and one star for the great coffee. If only the service were improved, I would happily offer a 5 star rating. We've been going there infrequently for about 14 months, mostly because I like good coffee. Finally after the fourth bad service experience I've decided to look elsewhere. Two cups of coffee were luke warm by the time they reached us and the slice of cheesecake to share came so much later we had nearly finished our coffee. Two things perplex me. Firstly, there were only 3 other tables with customers at the time (mid-afternoon on a weekday so not exactly buzzing with customers) and secondly, having cleared our own table of previous customer's plates (moved to an adjacent table), the waitress ignored those dirty plates along with others on tables nearby, which was bizzare since she walked past them 4 times. Finally, we had to go looking for the waitress to get the check since she never once checked in with us to see if we had everything we needed. I'm so terribly disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful but service is not.  I looked at the other reviews and this seems to be the consensus.  NOt sure why they don't try to correct it.  Patio is really nice on cooler nights.  I can't get my husband to go here anymore due to the service but the food is very good."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent Hillside.  We started off just going for breakfast (great breakfast burritos, by the way!) and then decided to try out their dinners.  Their food is awesome!  I've liked just about everything I've tried, with the exception being the fish tacos, and even those weren't bad, just mediocre.    Our favorites there are the guacamole as an appetizer, the carne asada torta (My husband raves about this one.), the chicken sandwich, and the salads.  Their fries are amazing, especially if you ask for a side of their homemade ranch.  My complaint with Hillside is the service.  On a few occasions, we've gotten waiters that aren't particularly friendly and forget to check in on us to see if we need anything.  And during peak times, they sometimes have dropped the ball and forgotten to bring out appetizers or drinks.  That being said, we look past the occasionally lackluster service and still dine their frequently.  The food keeps us going back.  Oh, and try the chocolate chip cookies!  Also... they have half-price bottles of wine on Wednesdays, ribs on Thursdays and craft beer night is also that night."}
{"text":"Unless they have cleaned up the back patio area, sit inside. Took my kids to eat, sat outside and it smelled terribly of sewage. Tables were dirty, food is ok."}
{"text":"Love Hillside for breakfast. Switched it up for a lunch burger. El Norteno with chorizo, green chile's, tomato, onion on a toasted bun. First time for the fries. A+++++"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, but I've been twice and won't go back.  Both times I have had to wait close to 30 minutes for my food.  And the food, while decent, wasn't worth a 30 minutes wait.  Plus, the cost of the food ($8+ for a sandwich) is pretty high considering that it comes with nothing on the side (no pickle, no chips, no fruti, nothing).  It's just not worth the money or the time for me to go back there."}
{"text":"The food at Hillside was good (he had a breakfast burrito and I had pancakes). The pricing and service was fine. We had to wait close to 40 minutes to get seated though. Overall it was a pretty good experience but I wasn't overly impressed."}
{"text":"Great place to go good service nice atmosphere good grub i highly recommend them the grilled cheese is good fresh crispy crunch bread. Love the fire outside on the patio"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing! But service isn't great. Barely saw our server and had to get the waters we asked for from the bar because they never came. Currently sitting at our table waiting for her to come back so we can pay it's been about 15 min since we saw her."}
{"text":"Always friendly, great for breakfast & lunch! Outside seating with fire pit or inside seating with lots of options. Extensive beer menu! Wifi option. Dog friendly :-) & bike parking.  We love to come here on a sat or sun afternoon, however be prepared there might be a wait. This is definitely an AZ one of a kind dinning experience...come and check it out for your self :-)"}
{"text":"We've had breakfast at Hillside many times and have never left a review until now. I was just reading a few of the reviews people have left. I think some of them must be naturally grumpy people or were having a bad day. I feel kind of bad for them. Well, maybe not really. If they don't want to give it another try that leaves more room for those of us that love this place. We have always found their staff top notch and very helpful. We love their breakfast and have had most everything on the breakfast menu. Love it all.  And an evening on the patio with a glass of wine and good company is all I need.  Love this place."}
{"text":"The valley could use more locally owned places such as this, a relaxing joint to have a bite and no need to feel like in a rush.  I definitely give credit to our table runner... just as I asked where the knife and fork was, he immediately said he'd get it and other staff were unobstrusive about removing our plates later.  Since it's not restaurant style and leave a tip on the table, I think the higher prices are justifiable for their great service and pay their salary.   As for the food, it's ok.. nothing mindblowing.. the bread (MJ's?!) under the croque monsieur was excellent but the rest was meh.. ended up scraping off the bechamel and eating the bread alone.  Tunia fish is fresh and tasty, generous helping.  It's really the combo of the  atmosphere and friendly vibe that would have me come back if I'm in the Ahwahtukee area."}
{"text":"Place is great, great menu, great food, great service, good ambience to boot.."}
{"text":"We went for a late breakfast today. A is close to home and I really enjoy the fact that they are locally owned and use local foods. The food was great and I would have given 5 stars but the service was not great. We really enjoyed the \"Hit the Spot\" pancakes and the El Jeffe omelet.  Will head back and try their Happy Hour for sure."}
{"text":"They have the best breakfast coffeeI have had in years!  I'm actually spoil and all ready have it in my morning routine"}
{"text":"Everything here is good! Be prepared to wait a little while for your food, especially if they're busy, because it's prepared made-to-order.  But it's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I ate breakfast and had a mocha here with soy. One of the absolute best places I've had for a coffee/mocha. In my top two places competing with Lux for the best specialty coffee I've had!"}
{"text":"I lived in walking distance of this place for two years and it sat empty. I finally move and a great place opens up...WTH? I am very happy that Ahwatukee is finally getting a few places that are up to my urban girl standards (Hillside Spot and Pomegranate). I was waiting like a kid on Christmas day for this place to open. One Sunday while at the Farmers Market I passed by and it was jammed packed. Not what I was looking for on a quite Sunday morning. I stopped by again during the week and they were closed. Talk about disappointed. I did snag a menu and it looked rather promising.  A few weeks go by and I stop in for lunch. The place is crowded but not crazy crowded. I go up to the counter and order and they give you a little number for your table or they call your name, I can't remember. I grabbed my drink at the self service area. I got a great ice tea. This is coming from a complete tea snob. I waited a few minutes and out came my tuna sandwich. To my surprise the bread was toasted. OK so I am about to go on a bit of a tangent here...TEXTURE, TEXTURE, TEXTURE. I hate tuna sandwiches on soft bread. It feels like a pile of mush in your mouth. Totally yucky in my book. But this sandwich was on toast...YEAH someone got the texture memo. However, the tuna was bland, with a bit more seasoning this could be an awesome sammie.  My next encounter was a few days ago. Just finished hiking South Mtn and decided to stop in with a friend. We were not starving but wanted a little something. I was told for dinner they have table service. OK I am standing at the register like it is lunch time. Maybe they should have a sign up for that. No biggie. The dinner menu was very small. I found myself looking at the lunch menu wishing some of the selections were available for dinner. We decide to split the Derby Salad and french fries. We wait what seems like forever and our fries come out by a runner. She says the salad would be out shortly. Well the salad took forever and a day. We were almost finished with the fries by the time the salad came out.   The kitchen is open so I could hear the cooks having some issues with my salad. It appeared that one of the ingredients was missing (bacon) but they located some and fried it up. It was a nice touch to the salad. But as long as I waited I could have done without it. The fries were fresh cut and just the right amount of seasoning. On my way out I spotted the biggest slice of red velvet cake in the cooler. OMG a little bit of the South started to come out. If you lived in the South you know what I mean. Red velvet cake is one of my favorites. I asked about the price and it was a very inexpensive $4.50. Wow what a steal. But today is not cheat day so I have to wait.   The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is cool.  However, a bit dark inside at night. This place has great potential. A definite need for this neighborhood. I think the menu might have to get tweaked and maybe the kitchen staff could be better prepared. As time goes on I am sure they will work out the kinks. All in all I don't think you would be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on the weekend, and I had none of the issues some of the below reviewers experienced.  The egg torta w/ avocado was delicious (including the bread), we got a table very quickly, and our server was professional and always there when I needed a coffee refill or more water.    That, combined with the local ingredients and the layout (tons of windows and light), make it a winner as far as I'm concerned!  Give it a try - I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"YUM!  My husband and I went on a Sunday morning for a late breakfast. I got Huevos Rancheros Verde and it was fantastic, very flavorful and not overly spicy. I ordered my eggs scrambled and they came fried but that isn't a huge issue for me because they where done properly and not overly oily.  The service was friendly and attentive and my tea got filled without me having to ask. I am looking forward to trying dinner here. The menu looked good and they have a great selection of local beers and you can even take a 6 pack home.  I will get go back here for sure."}
{"text":"This was the first time I have ever eaten in this restaurant.  A friend brought me here and loves the place.   The Service was great.  Friendly, upbeat and fun.   The food was incredible.  I only had a hamburger but it was very fresh (and almost too much to eat).  The fresh veggies and carmelized onions on the burger were yummy.  I was only able to eat about 3 of my homemade fries due to how big the burger was.   The atmosphere was wonderful.  Cozy, yet a combination of business folks and ladies lunching etc.   All in all a great experience.  I will definate recommend in the future."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast and I had the huevos rancheros. That came with a little side of fruits. The food was good and the ambiance at 7am was very quiet and pleasant. I loved the coffee there which was refilled generously throughout breakfast. It's probably one of my favorite places in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Too bad as I think the food and atmosphere is good, but twice now I got food posioning from this place.  I just can't risk going here anymore.   The last health inspection had 6 violations.   I've never got food posioning in Mexico but now 2 times from this place.....Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"While visiting AZ, we (husband & I) are typically on the look out for a good breakfast place. I found this place, so I was kind of excited to try it. We went on a Saturday morning around 9ish. The wait was not bad ~ 15 min. The coffee was lukewarm, not worth drinking. The food was okay - I kept thinking, \"This would be really good with . . .\" (an additional ingredient). Service was mediocre.   The vibe I got - this restaurant is for you if you want local, fresh, maybe organic, but flavor isn't as important."}
{"text":"this spot is amazing. came here to have breakfast with my dad while i was in town last week and it was so good we came back the very next day and order the same thing. the service was great and the atmosphere was laid back. i ordered the huevos rancheros and a cafe latte with whip cream and my dad ordered the croque madame. the very next day we both ordered the croque madame and it was just as delicious as the day before. the service the next day was just as great as the first day. i am always looking for a good breakfast spot whenever i visit AZ which is often. i also look for one to recommend to friends that recently moved to AZ and have this spot in mind to share."}
{"text":"Tried again bc it's kinda dog friendly. We called said one seat left for dogs, reserved it, wasn't available when we got in. Ok no biggie, after waiting they brought out another table. Didn't have mimosas, then next 2 wines we asked for. Brought my guy wrong omelet w no apologies. Fruit bowl was only strawberries, should call it strawberry bowl. They did bring a bowl out for our dog, but had to use our water to fill. Never ever again."}
{"text":"People waiting everywhere, pregnant lady and all. 6 empty tables outside 4 inside! If you can't take care of your customer it doesn't matter how good your food is! Checked in and out."}
{"text":"Having lived in Ahwatukee for 15 + years,  I have enjoyed Hillside Spot on several occasions.  I love the \"local\" vibe and great food.  What I didn't like on my last two visits (lunch last week and breakfast this morning)  is the feeling of dirtyness all around me.    I watched someone grab a rag from a square bucket sitting on the ground,  ring it out,  wipe down a table and then drop the rag back into the bucket (half in and half out with part of the rag touching the floor) repeat this same process throughout our meal.  (see photo). The fans are very dirty,  bathrooms are very dirty.  These are the areas that we as customers can see... Makes you wonder what we don't see.    The age and vintage feel of the restaurant is great.  Love that it's a part of the history of Ahwatukee,  but it doesn't have to be dirty.  It doesn't cost anything to clean...   I really enjoy this restaurant and would love to come back,  but not sure if I will until I know they change the cleanliness."}
{"text":"food is OK ambiance is nice portions were kinda small... SLOW service!! I asked for an extra side of tortillas.... it took forever it was brought over to me after I was way done with my food... we wanted to order more food but we didn't want to wait ... will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I have been here alone, with family (child included), friends, and with my significant other alone. Coming from someone who has been here various times throughout the day I can say that typically the quality of food is fresh and tasteful, but about two months ago we stopped in around 11 A.M. only to encounter a horrible experience. The food was stale and tasteless. The servers stood around appearing to laugh sarcatiaclly while water glasses at several tables stayed empty and coffee cups continued to lack refills.    A Few weeks later we returned. The food and service were better but there are some staff and one manager that clearly don't enjoy their jobs (turn off). This place is usually good but when it's bad-it is really bad.  Wifi-the consistently reliable wifi is reason enough to come here and give it an extra star."}
{"text":"My family and I just found this spot. It's a local place so we decided to give it a try. We have been there 3 times with today being our latest venture. We absolutely love the food but the employees just bring this place down. I sat at watched the food runner mope around looking half asleep and hating his job. He kicked the door open every time he went to the patio. His shoe prints were all over the door. He came inside once and pulled the door open so hard it actually hit the customer on the outside. He was taking food to the patio and he cut off some customers who were being seated. When he brought our food he asked if we needed anything else and my husband asked for more Splenda and he was CLEARLY annoyed with that request (he brought 2 packets). I cant believe this place is ok with this kind of \"customer service\". All three times we have been here we have had terrible waiters. The upside to today's meal was the girl who took our plates when we were finished. Very nice girl and did more for us than our own waitress. I'm all for supporting local businesses but you need to earn my business. Just because you are local to me doesn't mean I won't cross the freeway to Crackers where I can get better customer service. We decided today we will give it one more chance then we're done. I hope it doesn't dissapoint."}
{"text":"I use to love coming here but this will be the last time. 3 stars for the food and 0 stars for the service. The manager seems like he has no idea what he's doing and the waitress we got was rude as hell. She didn't even apologize when we told her we been waiting an hour for our food. She then comes back with the manager saying they lost our ticket. The lemonade was so sour I think the waitress was playing a joke because she seemed super racist. She didn't smile once wish I would got her name. My friends and I will never come here again."}
{"text":"We came across this place one morning as we needed some coffee to start our day.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was a  restaurant as well.  They were preparing the bbq pork for lunch and boy did that smell good!  We decided that this is a place we must visit again when we had more time.  So the following weekend, we return and order pancakes with fruit compote (apples) an spinach omelette and coffee. We received our omelette right away, but had to wait at least 30 minutes for syrup because they ran out.  Because we had to wait so long, they brought us a fresh order of pancakes once they got more syrup.    Hmmmm...I don't know about you but if you serve pancakes, shouldn't you always have syrup??  Oh well it was still delicious.  But that did not keep us away as they gave us a card for 2 free breakast or lunch for the inconvenience so we returned.    We went back for lunch this time and we both ordered the pork sandwiches....OH YUMMY! Mmmmm-Good! I must return for another one of those!  Did I mention the coffee is delicious?!  I would give at least four stars for this rating, but we were wanting pancakes with our omelette and running out of syrup is just not cool."}
{"text":"Okay..so I have been to this place at least 5 times and I keep thinking that the service will get better...well..that never happened, but as dumb as I am I decided to give it another try for lunch today...FAIL...it was..plainly put...horrible!!  The food got worse than it was before and as there was not a whole lot of people there at 3pm for lunch, I was surprised by this and the fact that it took almost 35 minutes to get our food.  Five times of coming here has added up to mediocre food, cold food, and to be quite honest shitty crappy slow service!  Don't know what it is because they have a good menu and location, but maybe they need to find people to work there who take great pride in service and food quality.  My carne asada torta tasted like ten day old meat that was scraped off of the ground in the back during the morning breakfast rush!  Anyhow...five times is enough..I won't be coming back as I know that I have given it enough chances to become a regular spot of my dining experience!"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I accidentally stumbled upon Hillside Spot this morning and I'm happy that we did. Initially, we were drawn in because we were looking for a good Latte/Espresso but when we smelled the food we had to take a seat and order breakfast. I started off with a Caramel Latte with an extra shot of espresso; it was perfectly balanced no bitterness at all. There was a nice foam on the top and little caramel left on the bottom when I was finished, YUM! For my entrée I had the El Jeffe Omelet which had fresh tomatoes, spinach and chorizo. It was pretty tasty (wish it was served with some sort of salsa), I also had the \"country potatoes\" which were really seasoned hash browns. The hash browns were a little salty for my taste but I mitigated the salinity with some ketchup and it was just fine. The atmosphere has a relaxed modern feel. I can definitely see myself going back here again. The service was a little slow since there was only two servers but I'm understanding."}
{"text":"Just tried this quaint little restaurant.... LOVE love LOVE IT !!!!  We will definitely be back !!! Food was AMAZING .... An I just love supporting local small business !"}
{"text":"As always, my wife and I are always looking for new places to eat.  We wanted to eat breakfast and decided on one place.  We soon realized that we needed to start out our shopping on the other side of town so we did another search for breakfast and found this place.  What a great find.  We were seated right away and our server came to us within just a few minutes.  I must say that their coffee was awesome.  It didn't taste like that chain restaurant coffee that everyone is use to.  The inside is very eclectic.  A lot of different things going on but very cool.  The one thing that I thought was so cool and that I love, is the open kitchen.  I don't know why but I really like to watch people in a kitchen cook.  The bar had those old time stools that reminded me of the stools in my science class in high school.  My wife had something called....well I can't pronounce it and sure as hell cant remember how to spell it so let me describe it.  It was a thick piece of Levain bread with ham, cheese and an egg.  Very simple and very delicious.  I did the BYO omelet (chorizo, turkey, gruyere, spinach and jalapenos were my choices) and it was delicious.  This is a spot that we will definitely try to come back to.  See you guys next time."}
{"text":"like a lot of other yelpers and my most recent dining companion, i really want to like this place. really, i do. they're doing something right! sourcing locally, using organic, whole ingredients...but more often than not they just don't click.  i've eaten here about five times now. twice for dinner, a couple of breakfasts and once for lunch. breakfast seems to be a slam dunk. it's pretty basic though chaotic on weekend mornings. pancakes are scrumptions. but it's true, there are an ungodly amount of flies in the place! lunch was ok. but on my most recent dinner trip, what i had was just blah. i ordered the chopped salad which could be so fantastic. hearty, leafy greens, cabbage, yulu seeds and other things make it sound like a healthy dish. but when it came out covered in a thick, creamy, tasteless ranch-style dressing, it was anything but. i could have overlooked the healthy factor if it tasted good, but the dressing was so bland there was just nothing to like about it.  i'll probably keep coming back here because, like i said, i desperately want to like it. though it will likely be only for breakfast."}
{"text":"Another year another review.  I've been going here for over two years now and it's still one of my favorite breakfast spots in Ahwatukee.  The restaurant has changed things up from time to time for the better and they always have great food.  The staff is always cheerful in the morning and they make a great mocha.  The also get bonus points for having an actual \"large\" mocha.  It's been awhile since I ate lunch or dinner here, but I'll have to scoot by for happy hour and update this review.  The breakfast menu has been updated to add a few new things and keep the old favorites.  I highly recommend the Huevos Rancheros Verde it's my usual go to breakfast and the best I have found so far anywhere in Phoenix.  The verde sauce is great ( not really spicy though ) and the Oaxaca cheese filled tortilla is delicious. If you aren't in the mood for eggs the \"Hit the Spot\" pancakes are a huge portion and really good.  Order the hash browns crispy though as they tend to be on the limp side if you don't. They have plenty of tables, a counter, and an outside patio for dining.   Try: - Huevos Rancheros Verde - Mocha - \"Hit the Spot\" Pancakes - Croque Madame"}
{"text":"Horrible service followed very expensive bland food, these guys were once a great place but got a little full of themselves and down hill they go.."}
{"text":"Most of the food here is decent.  I found a couple things I really like and stick to those.  And those couple dishes are really good.  The service here is so inconsistent though.  Sometimes it's excellent, sometimes it's just OK, and sometimes you will get seated and wait 15 minutes to even get a water.  Maybe an exaggeration, but it can really be that inconsistent.  I've been there at least a dozen times.  I'll probably go back again, but just because it is really close and affordable.  They could do better though."}
{"text":"I used to like this place but I don't think I'll be coming back. It's just not worth the price. Also asked for breakfast at 2 minutes after 4pm. Had the place been crowded I could have understood, but they were dead. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Usually the food can redeem a restaurant. Not this time. The pancakes were good, but not fluffy. When other yelpers say the service is bad, they're not lying.   When we first came in, they said a 20 minute wait, which is fine on a Sunday morning. That was not an issue. There is a \"market\" when you first come in, I ordered an iced coffee, it took about 10 minutes to get that. Now, I can be reasonable and say that that cashier was a server and was clearing out other guests bills. But come on, if your a \"market\" have someone manning the register and making the items your are offering.   Once we finally got seated, the server was very attentive. He got our drinks and let us discuss our what were going to order within our party. When he returned, he wrote everything down and I am assuming he entered the ticket. But he did not return to get us a refill for about 10 - 15 minutes. About 5 - 10 minutes later, someone in my party had to ask the server when we would expect our food (after we had already waited twenty minutes), he said \"less than two minutes.\" It a came about five minutes later.   I ate chilsques verdes, and at least I can be some what certain that the chicken was not from a can. I got a piece of bone in one bite and in another bite I got chicken cartilage from a drum stick.   I believe if they continue to have this bad service, it will eventually bite them I'm the butt.   The real reason I am giving them two stars instead if one, is because the atmosphere is very nice. The experience was way too bad for me to want to give this place after chance. Nor is the food redeeming enough. And also, for the amount of food you get, this really should be a $$$ restraunt."}
{"text":"We went back for another visit just a couple of weeks ago, hoping things had gotten better.  Nope.  We wanted to sit outside, near the fire.  You'd think we asked the hostess if we could sit on the roof.  Obviously, we pissed her off just by daring to come in.  Service was slow - and it wasn't even that busy!  And for the love of Pete, could you do something about your staff yelling out orders and such?    Sorry, as much as I like supporting local businesses, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Food is great and the staff is friendly. Good music and they even have Finn River Cider. Breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"Gotta come here for the carne asada tortas, is what I was told.  While I liked the bread, the carne asada on the other hand was dry and overcooked.  It would have been great if it were juicier and more flavorful.  Otherwise the overall sandwich was alright, nothing which stands out."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelmed. Dropped in to grab a to-go order at 7:30pm on a Tuesday and almost turned around before entering because I thought it was closed. No hostess was visible and the place looked completely empty. It was open though with a sign to seat yourself. Servers seemed to just roam and help anyone who asked for something. The atmosphere could be really cute, but the lack of friendliness and customers made it feel very awkward and quiet.  After all was said and done, our $20 rib eye with a side of stir fry bell peppers and side salad (which literally was just a bowl of wilted arugula - not even a crouton), $15 shrimp and veggie pasta (which was penne pasta with what looked like the same stir fry mix in an oily/butter sauce) and two $6.50 glasses of subpar wine was definitely not worth it. And to top it off, a server set down the to-go food and walked off. I had to ask another server if they wanted me to pay the bill before I left.  I expect far more from a restaurant's atmosphere, customer service and food quality for $52.13."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great vibe which is hard to find.  I went there with three friends for a late breakfast and we were seated quickly.  However that is all that happened quickly.  Although it was not crowded it took 45 minutes to be served and another 45 to get our checks.  We had questions about our bills and it took another 15 minutes before we saw our server again.  Everyone's meal was iffy. I had an omelet which was so overcooked that I had to put salsa on it to moisten it up.  I asked for two substitutions and was charged for added ingredients, $1.50 for avocado and onion instead of chorizo and red peppers. The server should have told me there would an additional charge even if it was a substitution. The huevos rancheros looked just as overcooked and dry.  Don't think I will return because of so many disappointing issues with service, food quality, and charges. They had very few options for a gluten free meal so I don't think it would be possible to avoid \"substitution\" surcharges. Their prices would be fine if the quality were better."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! OMG I had the croque madame with a poached egg on top! It was so authentic and delicious! Heavenly will go back anytime I am in need of breakfast/lunch in Ahwatukee!!!! Wish they were in Scottsdale! Open one in Scottsdale so I can go every week!"}
{"text":"Service was good and madam croquet was really good!!! Definitely have to try. Ordered 3 and my kids and my husband and me loved it. They don't have French toast ... But everything is fresh. Freshly squeezed orange juice ..."}
{"text":"So I've been here a few more times in smaller groups and during less crowded times. My new favorite is the Levain & Lox... it's so very yummy.  I still think it's uber trendy and that's not drawing to me but i honestly enjoy the food and even the staff at the bar (i prefer there lately)is nice and attentive. .it's kind of hipster at times but I've grown to just accept that and still enjoy my food and yummy coffee."}
{"text":"What was once a wonderful establishment where you could come and hangout with your friends and enjoy fine dining (breakfast, brunch and lunch too) is now something tasteless. I mean that quite literally. I use to come here several times a week because my friends were working here and we all lived nearby so we'd spend a lot of time eating up the menu. I notice their corns are still a hit! But upon moving back recently from college, I wanted to give it a try since it been a few years. The reason I am not giving this place 1 star is because our waitress was very sweet. I can't remember her name but she was a pretty blonde girl with glasses, we adored her! She was so prompt, kind, and had a great personality.   Now for the food. I have always ordered the carne asada sandwich. I ordered it recently and there was absolutely no flavor. What once use to be a delicious carne asada that had this flavorful marination and sauce that would drip as you took a bite is now a very dry, disgusting, plain, no-good sandwich. I mean really? I am paying a little over $9 for a sandwich that has dried up steak meat with avocado thrown on top? and french fries that were plain and dry. No thanks.   My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwich with corn on the side. His chicken was not only over-cooked and super dry, I am pretty sure there was NO sauce in his sandwich either. It had no flavor, we were using the tobasco and chalula sauce like crazy. This isn't the Hillside Spot I remember.   The only good thing? The coffee was great, the corn was awesome, and our waitress was a sweetheart."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. Tried it twice and both experiences were a fail. First time the omelette were burned. Second time, nobody even acknowledged we were in the cafe. We sat and sat, and sat. Staff were chit chatting with each other and never looked our way. Finally we got up and walked out. Nobody cared because nobody said a word to us."}
{"text":"I like this place but it's over priced!!! The waittress should have realized that there were other ways to price out grilled chicken and salad than to charge me $20 for French fries I didn't want!"}
{"text":"Always a good place with a hip vibe.  Healthy, yummy and fun.  Something for everyone and a good mix of people.  Great outdoor patio seating area as well."}
{"text":"This place is circling the drain.  I don't get it... The location is great with little competition nearby but when we went there today they were so slow and the food was so poorly cooked that we won't be going back and will drive 10 minutes more to go somewhere else.  The place has a lot of potential, good menu and ambiance, but the execution is poor.  I hope they go out of business soon so someone can open up something better at that location."}
{"text":"I love this place, accept for their black coffee. I've had the smoked ribs, hamburgers, breakfast burritos, etc. and I loved them all. Service is great as well. We take our out of town visitors there. The coffee during breakfast though is too watered down so get your coffee before or after your visit."}
{"text":"We had an extremely long wait for 6 on a sunday morning around 10. Not much they can do about that though. When we finally did eat I had the chilaquiles. The food was good, but didnt even come close to filling me up. It was fresh and had good flavor. I just wish that for the price i would have gotten a bit more. I also ordered a side of sour cream ($0.50 for a large spoonful). When I reminded them about the sour cream the server left and then came back empty handed. He then took the side of sour cream from my friends plate (breakfast burrito) and gave it to me saying it was supposed to be mine. Really? Why not just leave his on his plate which he may have already touched and bring me a new one? Especially since it was your fault in the first place. A little odd if you ask me."}
{"text":"Ok.. maybe it's me.  Maybe I just bring bad luck and trouble with me when I go here....I don't know...it's so confusing..  I keep going back every month or so because I really want to like the place and make it part of my routine.. it's in my 'tukee neighborhood, the food is really good when it's done right and it's an interesting building and setup.  I repeat, I want to like this place.  A lot.    So I took my brother from San Diego who's in town there for breakfast this morning around 9:15AM or so.  Knew we were in trouble with a line to the door  and only one cash register working at the counter.  It took about 15 minutes to get to the counter and there were another 20 people behind us.  (Popularity and poor customer service practices are not giving this place sufficient time and space to clean up their act.)  We ordered, got our number and he sat and I went to the coffee counter to get my Americano.  While waiting on my Americano at the counter I ask the young man 'what's up with this line and a 15 minutes wait to order?'  His response was 'it's because we're so popular everyone wants to eat here'.  Say what? So that justifies a 15+ minute standing wait to order?  I suggested he go  to US Egg in Tempe to really see how a popular and very successful breakfast lunch place delivers excellent customer service.  He made some snide aside to his counter mate, I got my Americano and sat down.  To wait. Dread set in once again.  Bro and I waited 15-18 minutes for our food.  They were out of tableware when I got up to go get some so someone brought us some from the back, including a nice plastic fork. Classy eh.    Breakfast was good.  Oatmeal, eggs, toast.. A couple of proteins with this eggs for Bro.. All done well.  They do get their food right most of the time here.  It's the service level that since day one has been and still can be very iffy.  I get they had one out of two counter cash registers broken.. And that's not my problem as a customer.  What's their back up plan?  Or it is to make people just stand and wait?    We ate, talked.. and waved at flies.  This place has more flies in it than any restaurant I've ever eaten at in this country.  I saw several folks at tables next to us also doing the Hillspot fly wave. It's been that way since opening. I still don't know why.  The really need to get on top of this.  Now.  Flies. Food. Bad.  My bro, instead of leaving as a raving fan of the place, left, like me, shaking his head.  This place really really needs a customer service excellence intervention.  And soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today.  I enjoyed the El Norteno burger.  Great chorizo.  The food was four stars while the service was relaxed.   Do not stop here for lunch if you have an hour to return to the office.  Great beer selection which since I was returning to the office I did not sample."}
{"text":"I love that the Hillside Spot is in my neighborhood because we need more places like this, but I think they are just now working through the problems of opening a new place in a \"cool-restaurant\" starved area.  My first visit was a little weird.  It was crowded and there was no clear understanding of how it worked (no table service at breakfast).  We had just hiked S. Mtn and it was pouring rain.  The line was out the door.  People were pissy and rushed - even the diners.  The room was cold, but you could tell the open architecture would awesome if it wasn't so loud, cold and frantic that morning.  Normally I don't mind the loud, fast more urban breakfast atmosphere but people were fighting over tables and the food deliverers were hard to track down.  Anyway, my farmer's omlette was grossly greasy (egg whites with awesome local veggies lying in a puddle of oil) and the toast wasn't really toast but rather a grease-smeared thin slice of bread thrown on the grill.  I heard from people next to us that I should have had the pancakes or even the bacon & egg scone.   Next time...  I decided to give them another chance the next week when I took a group of friends there for dinner.  WE LOVED IT.  The pace was slower.  Our waiter was helpful and sweet.  We were in high spirits with our glasses of wine and girl talk.  The hamburgers, french fries, rotisserie chicken, salads were all fantastic.  I will definately go again.  I'm already craving the hamburger and that's really not my style.  Must be good."}
{"text":"The Hillside Spot has so much potential, but management or owners are letting service fall through the cracks.   The hipster staff could be excellent, but they need much better management. An employee told us that it was \"seat yourself\" so the three of us found a table in the center of the restaurant. We sat there for 20-30 minutes and no one stopped by our table. We finally had to flag a random server down.  They really shouldn't have a \"seat yourself\" policy if they can't keep an eye on things.  We met here because Hillside is one of the few places open early.  The chilaquiles were nice and crunchy. The green chili flavor was great. The croque madam was also well made. The bacon was pretty basic. The hashbrowns were only slightly crispy, but I'm glad they were overly greasy. I love the look and design of the restaurant. The bar is cute. The selection of local and craft beers is awesome.   This could be an excellent restaurant, but they need to re-train everyone."}
{"text":"Terrible! I always want to give this place a chance but obviously I need to move on.  The service is probably the worst I have ever experienced and this time the food was just as bad. I think whoever owns or operates this place didn't realize that getting in to the restaurant biz means getting in to the customer service biz. I will never ever go back unless I hear there is new management. Bummer cuz it's a cool spot."}
{"text":"Great food. Service consistently blows. Sit at the bar and you will be fine."}
{"text":"This is a good local and healthy meal at a reasonable price.  Beer and wine selection is a plus. Menu could use a little updating but maybe we eat there too much."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of our friends for Sunday brunch. Upon checking in with the hostess we were told the wait will be 25 min.  after 45 min we asked how much longer we had to wait. The hostess said \"we are working on it!\"I reminded her how long we have been waiting and she told me she's going to get a manager. The manager Omar told me he can have us seated at 2 separate tables but that we couldn't put them together (no given explanation as to why when I asked, he simply ignored us) that's when we decided to leave. I still couldn't figure out why we didn't get our table but as we were leaving I overheard the hostess talking. Omar the manager told them to not put tables together for large parties but to seat as many 2-4 tops as possible because they were easier and faster! The WORST customer service I've experienced in a restaurant and I've been in the industry of fine dining for 10 years. Get a new manager and retrain your staff never coming here again"}
{"text":"We have been trying to give these guys chance after chance for years! No More! Tonight was the last straw. Every single time we have tried to eat here, there has been some issue from the food to the service. It's Saturday night at 7:00 pm and they have about 12 tables. Nello's across the parking lot is mobbed with patrons waiting outside. Umm, what's wrong with this picture?  Tonight, we came in and were seated right away but it took awhile for our server to get to us. She came and took our drink order then left again. She came back with the drinks and took our order. We ordered the Grazing Platter with 3 items. We were pretty disappointed with the quality of the meats and cheeses on the platter.  Our food came and the server dumped our plates down and didn't even bother to pick up the dishes and so forth from our appetizer. Then my husband looked at his Croque Madame. His over easy egg looked like rubber and was so overcooked it the yoke was solid. The sandwich was charred on the edges and pretty much inedible. We tried for 15 minutes to get someone's attention, including calling out \"excuse me\" and we were ignored. When we finally got her attention and my husband let her have it, he didn't ask her to take the food away because he was starving and had decided to make due. She took the food without asking, my husband having said he didn't want anything else. She left him with a tiny cup of berries. He refused to take half of my burger until I said I was full. Which I did on purpose so he had something to eat.   We saw her go talk to the manager, who incidentally was expediting and the one who let the food go out in the first place,  and heaven knows what was said, but he obviously didn't want to be bothered.   She finally came back - 10 minutes minutes later - and we asked for the check. She got no tip and a note on the bottom of the receipt."}
{"text":"Mediocre service and food.  They sat us at a table right by a door with people constantly coming and going even though there were plenty of tables available.  The coffee was barely lukewarm.  Ia sled for another one and got the same thing.  the bacon was fatty and cheap.  The food was also lukewarm at best.  I didn't see the waitress except for ordering and bringing the check.  I could have gone to Denny's and had a better experience."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast only IMO. Sandwiches like a Ruben made with turkey is Not a Ruben. Oh they have burgers but no roast beef, corned beef or pastrami . Ate there today , my friend & I paid 24$ for uneaten food . Change your big menu, lose most Mexican redundant on your never ending menu& simple it up deli sandwiches...salads...burgers..pastries ..good, no Great sides and your lunch hours won't be so very empty!"}
{"text":"Delicious burger!  They have a massive menu with something for everyone.  My gf got a light basil-pesto chicken with a nicely sweet bread, while I got a southwestern burger and fruit on the side.  This is a gem in ahwatukee.  Walking in, I felt at home because it reminded me of many cafes from Boston; it was clean but with a bit of hip grunge look.  There's a big garage door on the one side of the restaurant that opens out for a large patio in the cooler months.  I'll definitely return here when I make trips to ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and because it was my first time going I wasn't sure what I was planning to eat yet. The waitress who helped me was very energetic, smiling and was nice enough to answer all my questions about the menu. She suggested I try out their watermelon mimosa and it was definitely really good. Overall my experience was good there until it was time to pay. After she brought out my check and I handed her my card she brought back my receipt and after I was finished I had definitely left satisfied and happy that I had found a new place near me to come and hang out. Now the downside was later that day as I was getting home I realized I couldn't find the card I had used to pay with and so I decided to call them so they could check to see if by any chance I had left it there since I clearly remember she never brought it back. Now this is when my experience changed. As I call in a girl answered and I let her know I had been eating there earlier and that there was a possibility my card was never returned. She then tells me that she will transfer me to a manager and let me tell you this guy had the worst customer service and annoying voice to top it off. So as soon as I got transferred he doesn't even introduce himself or even asks me what he can help me with instead he asked for my name and the color of my card. After I give him the info he tries to say my name and has a hard time pronouncing my last name so then proceeds to say \"yea whatever it is\". At this point I'm getting upset so I tell him I'll be heading over since I thought it was strange they had kept it. As soon as I arrive some guy yelled over at me and asked if I was going to order something and after I told him what I was there for he says \"Oh right!\" In a rude tone and walks away. I'm then left standing there waiting for my card so I asked another guy who was heading to the cash register and before I could finish my sentence he hands me the card with a fake smile and just says \"YEAH\" in a high pitch sarcastic tone even after the fact that I'm still nice enough to say thank you. One thing I did find strange was the fact that I noticed there were other cards in the register besides just mine. It made me think if maybe I wasn't the only one that this had happened to and that's why the manager had asked for my name and card color. Either way though the way they handled this was very rude.   From all the places I've been to I've never had someone keep my card and to top it off act so rude and unprofessional. I understand accidents happen and she could've forgot to return it but they could've handled this more professionally and maybe even apologized for having to make me go back to pick up MY CARD that they shouldn't have kept in the first place. Because of their unprofessionalism I have unfortunately decided not to return especially knowing how the manager running the place handles things."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It's got a nice atmosphere, good service and good food.  My husband and I both had salads- the Asado and Venetian with shrimp which were both delicious.  My daughter enjoyed the sweet crepes.  They serve breakfast food all the time and in a previous visit I had one of the breakfast burritos which was also good.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, pulled pork sandwich was average and the coffee was bland. Would probably not recommend the food we ordered."}
{"text":"There are so many reasons to avoid this place, but I'll be short.  Go to Nellos, it will save you the hassle.  1. Poor service - the first time to contact was around 10 to 15 minutes. There were no apologies. The server noticed us after we started making forts out of menus. 2.  Two servers noticed us, but went on their merry way. 3. Inaccurate beer list - I get excited about beer. They didn't have 3 beers on their menu. The server didn't know what they had in stock. 4. Overpriced beer - $9 for beer you can get for $6 at Bevmo. 5. Flies - holy Pete Sampras, a crap load of flies. We had to eat fast just so the flies wouldn't get our food.  We went to Dairy Queen across the street to make up for the horribleness."}
{"text":"Long story short we came from Los Angeles to a wedding in AZ, before we left I wanted to try this place. The food was okay, the waitress was terrible. She didn't come to our table until it was time to pay, we asked for the check and she was no where to be found so we walked to front register and paid. We were driving back home so I ran back on to use the bathroom, Before I walked out she appeared in front of me and said \"was something wrong?\" And I was so confused and I said \"I'm sorry, I don't think I understand\" and she said I front of bunch of customers \"you didn't leave me a tip!, where my tip\".. OMG I couldn't not believe her I have worked as a waitress before so I couldn't not believe that just happened to me. I was so embarrassed and I looked at her and I just walked away and she still yelled \"hey!\" As I left.. Never again will I go back there and I hope she learns some manners. I always tile for good service how was I suppose to tip a person that was completely MIA."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast.  The hubby had the pancakes as recommended- I must say D-lish! even without any butter or toppings.  I try to stay away from carbs, but I had to keep sneaking bites from the Mr's plate.   They have a cool patio to eat outside- the weather was perfect!"}
{"text":"I love this quaint restaurant! I have so much fun eating here because the choices on their menu are unique, yet familiar. I adores my tuna salad sandwich and my daughter loved her classic pb&j. Our server, David, was very friendly and accommodating, and out my daughters order in first so she could eat faster!"}
{"text":"I've been to Hillside Spot around a dozen times and have not had a negative experience other than for some reason I can't remember the name...  \"Is it Hillspot Side Diner...no...hm\".   I would not survive if it were not for google and a phone that is smarter than me.  Anyway, I love the place. They seem to try to carry as much local items as possible. I was delighted to find out that they serve Cartel Coffee, which is seriously the best coffee you will get in the area. Like many reviews have noted, the bread is fantastic. I particularly enjoy the Croque Madame. Ugh..I'm salivating like a Pavlovian dog just thinking about it.  I like to go with a book and read by the fireplace outside in the few weeks in the valley that it's temperate to do such a thing. The ambiance of the place is hip and comfortable.  Great service and staff. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for lunch and it is pretty awesome. The star reduction is for lackluster/slow service at times, very cramped Indoor seating and the two times I came with my baby to meet friends and their two highchairs were in use (they have since purchased more). I almost always get the pulled pork (which has a yummy slaw and apple slices on it), the grown up grilled cheese or street corn. The salads are great as well. They are all about local and organic products/produce and there is a bohemian easy-going vibe there. The juices and lemonades are fresh-squeezed. The outdoor seating area is great! They also sell local brews and homemade baked goods."}
{"text":"Went for lunch one beautiful day.  Food was pretty good, if you like your tuna sandwich with 1-inch chucks of solid tuna.  Great location.  Nice patio, if they can do something about the blackbirds and flies.  Coffee-counter was nice, but the person at the register was very impersonal, almost off-putting.  They should consider having someone else at the ordering station/cashier.  I will try for a 3rd visit, but if it does not improve, I will stick with Nello's, next door.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and has mediocre food. We asked for separate checks when we entered and after we ate they told us we couldn't have separate checks. I tried to talk to the manager, but he just walked away. This used to be a great place, but when they went to full service , raised prices and took some of their best items off the menu ,it became just another overpriced restaurant that couldn't care less about customer service."}
{"text":"5 stars for ambience 3 stars for food  Okay, let's get one thing straight, it's NOT the best place for breakfast in Ahwautukee or the East Valley; I don't know what is, but I do know Crackers on Elliot and Hardy offers better food. The appeal of this place comes down to it's ambience. It has a very urban feel and reminds one of the breakfast places in San Francisco or any large cosmopolitan city. Everything from the black chalkboard menu to the funky sodas to the Emo/Snow Boarder waiters who yell your name out. Think La Grande Orange in the East Valley! You order at the register and they bring your food to you. You get your own silverware and sauces.  It was also suprisingly quick.   The pancakes came with peanuts, caramel syrup and whipped cream. Honestly, it would have been better with nothing on it. The toppings did nothing for it aside from making it too sweet. The pancakes themselves were what sold me on it as they actually had flavor instead of being like your typical IHOP or McDonalds pancake that is flavorless until you drown it in syrup. The Turkey sandwhich was good but largely because of its bread, other than that, there was really nothing special about it either. I feel like even Teakwoods, the sports bar on Ray and Kyrene has sandwhiches that are more unique like its BLT with a fried tomato.  We had the pancakes and the turkey sandwhich. Both were excellent but both also had something missing. I would probably come back here for the combination of the ambience and the food as opposed to the food itself. I wasn't blown away by the food but the place was a lot of fun because it's unique. We certainly need to support more places like this if we want more non-chains.  The bottomline is it's worth going to because it's fun and it's a great place to take people. Nonetheless, it's clear people have allowed the ambience and vibe to affect it's opinion of the food. The food is good but not noteworthy"}
{"text":"Had dinner on a Wednesday night and it was wonderful. Found a great parking spot, was sat on the patio immediately, and we both enjoyed the food. I had the pulled pork sandwich and my hubby got a burger. Grabbed a piece of carrot cake to go on our way out. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Took a friend here for breakfast. She had the chilaquiles and I had an omelette. It was absolutely delicious. The crispy bacon, diced tomatoes, and cheddar cheese in my omelette were totally yummy. My friend's chilaquile was really crispy, covered in green sauce and a fried egg. I only gave it 4 stars because I went back a few days later and the food was less stellar.  But still good. I will try to go back during lunch.  The burger looked amazing!"}
{"text":"First off, let's talk about what I really enjoy about this spot. I love love their setup: open kitchen and bar, cute outdoor patio with hanging string lights, pet-friendly, a decent amount of baked goods, craft beer and wine bottles up front. I also like the suki's bowl on their menu - very well-thought and flavor-focused combination of ingredients. They also have friendly and attentive staff.   Despite the fact that this location has so much potential, I think they can do better with the menu. First time here, I ordered a bowl of clam chowder on their special of the day menu since I wasn't really hungry. It was average from the presentation to the taste. Second time around, I settled for an order of croque madame topped with over medium egg, side order of fresh melons and extra crispy hash browns. I also got an iced toddy.  It was nice of the server to leave me (a little bit too much) room and a side of classic syrup so I can customize my toddy. The food took a while to come out yet everything was at room temperature when they got to my table. Although the egg was cooked perfectly, my extra crispy hash browns was mostly soft and soggy :(. Croque madame was also average. Considering it was my first time trying croque madame, I can't tell if this is exactly how it supposed to be and I just happen to not liking it; or I can get better croque madame somewhere else. Fresh melons were cool and sweet, though!   Overall, there are few things I like about this place, especially their decor. There are also basic things I can care less for, that they can improve on. The 3 stars were given for the layout, service, and suki's bowl."}
{"text":"I love summer.  Not because we become nocturnal and have to hibernate during the day.  I love summer because I get to drink iced coffee.  Up until a few months ago, all I knew was that I loved iced coffee, didn't really think about who had the best . . . until I had Hillside's iced coffee!!!  How do they do it?  How can it be so delicious?  I never noticed being impressed at other places and now nothing seems to compare to Hillside's.  I have been back three times just for the iced coffee and to see if it was a one time thing, but it was not.  Each time the iced coffee (with just a hint of milk, no sugar) has blown me away!  And the cherry on top?  Cheddar Bacon scones!  Yep, I said it!  I have never really been interested in scones before and have always claimed to have more of a savory tooth than a sweet tooth.  Blueberry, cherry, eh.  When it came to take it or leave it, I always left it.  Today, I had to take it!  This morning, I saw the delicious Cheddar Bacon scones in the case and had to have one.  I was not disappointed.  Light and fluffy, chunks of bacon, yet each bite was nicely balanced and not over powered by either cheddar or bacon.  Oh Hillside Spot, I heart you!  Update 8/2:  I finally have an answer to my question \"How do they do it?  How can it be so delicious?\"  The answer is they get their coffee from the Cartel Coffee Lab.  Who knew!?  We do . . . now.  Check it out. http://www.yelp.com/biz/cartel-coffee-lab-phoenix#hrid:w6hrU_1NGdkAGEM2B_ot1w"}
{"text":"We love love love Hill side! We have breakfast here a few times a week and it's always delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Food was fresh and even during lunch, when it was super busy, the food came out fast.  Prefect spot to sit out on the patio."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place! I like that you order right when you enter and they bring you the food at your table or on the patio. Its simple and straight forward. I like the modern decor as well--comfy but simple. Theres plenty of light coming in--seems like a great place to lounge around after your meal, chatting or reading a book. We went for brunch and split the croque monsieur and flaco torta. I loved the torta sandwich--the chorizo was spicy and I loved the slices of avocado. The open face sandwich was good as well, but my gf kept wanting another bite of my sandwich! I had a great iced coffee drink as well. I've heard they started offering dinner and happy hour as well..if only I lived nearby!! I would hit this place up all the time!"}
{"text":"This is the closest local place open early for breakfast that we could find.  When we came in we figured out it is seat yourself. I like that! We didn't sit outside because it is hot already in the morning. We did sit by the window which was close enough to outside while still enjoying the great AC inside.   This place did not disappoint. On the menu is a note stating everything is made fresh and prepared when YOU order. Perfect!  We took a while to read everything on the menu, the waitress was patience enough with us and helped us finally decide what we wanted to order.   Once we ordered the food came fresh and delicious. Eggs were cooked to perfection and potatoes were heavenly.   We took some pastries and cookies for the road. Melt in your mouth deliciousness. We will be back for lunch or dinner on our next visit.   Walking out noticed there is a sign letting customers know if they can seat themselves or wait to be seated. Also note they serve local craft beers. Morning so no trying this time!"}
{"text":"Server was very nice.....35 min.wait after we ordered to get simple breakfast. Charged extra for hashbrowns on a standard egg breakfast....1 small piece of toast instead of two. had to ask for extra syrup. One half of one ounce is what they give you ..They cut too many corners for their higher prices"}
{"text":"I went here last Sunday, it was crowded but decided to wait out the 30 minutes. So glad I did! It was cool walking in to a cafe serving coffee, lattes and more! They also have coolers with all types of craft made beers. That day there was a lunch special on their watermelon margaritas which were good and refreshing on that hot day.  The food prices aren't the cheapest but the food is pretty good. It's a place with trying."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Hillside from various friends, and so my husband and I decided to try it for a mid morning brunch. We walked in around 11:30 and the place was packed, so we assumed we'd have to wait for a table. We were given a menu to look at while we waited, and 5 minutes later were led to our table.   Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, and he filled our waters regularly throughout our meal. The breakfast menu had many options, most of which were southwestern cuisine. There was also an option to create your own breakfast sandwich.  We have not been for lunch, but with our breakfast experience and the promising menu options, we'll probably be back for lunch.   The outside patio area looked inviting, with comfortable seating and a fire pit. I'm sure it's very pleasant in cooler temperatures.   The coffee bar at the front of the store was very accommodating for someone who doesn't always have time to sit down for a meal. It looked like you could order any beverage and various food items from the to-go coffee bar. I'll definitely be back in to get some of their delicious coffee!  I definitely recommend Hillside for breakfast or brunch... Or at least for their coffee!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious breakfast with the family today at a local favorite. Started off with an almond milk latte and blueberry muffin. Husband and I split the El Gallo Torta and Breakfast Burrito. Managed to get a pic of 1/2 the a burrito but the torta was devoured before I remembered. I highly, highly recommend both SO GOOD! You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. Great for coffee, baked goods, breakfast and lunch. The market place offers a great selection of wine and craft brews to take home. It always free good to support local business so be sure to stop in soon!"}
{"text":"Really cool environment with lots of diversity.  Their food quality is really good and fresh. Very friendly employees and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Love it.  Bread is amazing, good atmosphere and yummy fish fry on Friday nights"}
{"text":"Hillside Spot is a great little restaurant with a mini market place.  Great food, wine & craft beers.  I like their iced tea as well. Decent happy hour food & drink specials.  It's a great place for business breakfasts or lunches.  Nice patio and indoor seating."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast!  The servers are friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Hillside Spot is easily one of my favorite restaurants!  I've been here many times and not once have I been disappointed.  I don't know exactly what their secret is, but their food is ALWAYS the best.  I have a sneaky suspicion that is wood grilled meats, or maybe just a secret spice in their marinade/rubs.    From breakfast to tacos or pasta they are number one! Hillside is one of the BEST restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast spots. Food is good as well as the atmosphere. If you are looking to try local craft beers, the is a great place."}
{"text":"I really like this place because they get all their ingredients from LOCAL shops/markets and farms, which is so awesome!   Their food is great, unique ingredients on many of thier menu items. I had the \"Flaco\" Torta, which was basically egg white, avocado, spicy aioli on a sonorense telera bread from a local mexican bakery. YUMM. Best sandwich bread I think I've ever had.    Great little hipster cafe, definitely stop by here and support a local cafe and all the local businesses they work with :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. The burritos are so good, esp. The breakfast one! Sometimes it is hit or miss but honestly there are some wonderful people are servers there. My boyfriend hates all but one IPA and it was awesome that one of the guys there was able to find something close to what he liked. Always friendly and accommodating.  The food is good but I love the people and environment!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service! Their pancakes and omelets are extremely good and amazingly fluffy! The price is great also. The only thing I have to say is.. the flies ruin it all"}
{"text":"I am going to say I have eaten here at least 30 times. It's a mile from my house, and let's face it, Ahwatukee does not have enough fresh, hip eateries. We have wanted so badly for this place to be a success that we have continued to eat here even when we have had the worst service imaginable, and even when the menu was going through its own growing pains, and even though we had some meals that were so ridiculously inconsistent it seemed impossible that the cooks were being given the same recipes.  This morning we went in for breakfast, and after a short wait we were seated. The server was delightful--friendly, but she also knew instinctively when to come and go. I saw a lot of new faces among the staff, and I also saw a lot of tables turn over, which used to be next to impossible since getting a check used to be like waiting for a dr.'s appointment at the VA. I remember so many times I got up to get my own drinks or even grab my own food from the window because the server was chatting.   They have also reorganized the menu, and I really like it--some of the same foods but with many more options like make your own omelets and burritos. I really hope they can keep it together. It's not like they haven't had enough complaints about the service. They know it's an issue. I hope they have found a way to solve it since we would like to continue supporting them."}
{"text":"I would say this place is really great for breakfast. I ate here for lunch today having carne asade tacos.  They were too dry. My sis had a hamburger which was good, she would not say great. The French fries were really good. Yum!  Other sister had a turkey sandwich which was good also.  Great service."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Nothing that wowed me. Coffee was also good. Staff were attentive, but looked angry - no smiles when we were there on a Sunday. Also witnessed some pretty interesting gaffs - they brought our food to us twice (ooops), and while making the tea managed to spill most of the entire huge pot on the floor . . . Did I mention the frowns?"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out since I was in the area. Super busy but was seated right away at the bar. I ordered the El Guac burger, it was delicious.  Made exactly how I ordered it. It came with fresh cut fries too. Very tasty, I ordered it medium and the flavor was really good. Jon was our waiter, very nice and let me taste some beers before I decided on Four Peaks Kolsch. I would have given them five stars if it were not for the disgusting bathroom."}
{"text":"WHY WHY WHY is the customer service so inconsistent? Why aren't the servers taught to SMILE, be on top of refilling drinks and clearing tables???? People go for an experience and service. Please PLEASE teach your staff to give quality service. Patrons shouldn't be seen searching for their server just to ask for the check.   Bonus: food is always good."}
{"text":"Hillside is doing everything right,  EXCEPT the BREAD.  I looked past it the first time.  Called it a fluke, went back tried other thing.  But this bad bread ruins a whole sandwich.  It looks like European bread, it is NOT.  Hillside needs to change bread distributors.  It could be as simple as \"La Brea\" or even \"Fresh and Easy's\" new bakery products.  It is tragic because I love everything Hillside has done; the windows the open kitchen the casual environment remind me of the greatest restaurants in town; La Grande Orange, True Food and The Vig.  I would eat here weekly if only they weren't compromising on the bread.  To the owners, I plead, get some gourmet breads, European style, herb breads, Sourdough, breads, Whole Grain with Nuts, even sprouted grain breads if you want to cater to the super healthy, but the croissant-looking, Roman Meal tasting bread should go."}
{"text":"I really liked the pancakes I had, very fluffy. I think the maple syrup I got with them was natural and not from a bottle. The service was good and the decorations were very nice. Over all great experience!"}
{"text":"At first when this place opened I loved it even though the service was awful (except for Nicole). The MJ breads and croque monsieur were fantastic. After Chris left though it has taken a dive.  The service the last three times \"3\"! I have been there has been terrible. The people at the counter acted like we were bothering them simply by placing an order ( I am very sensitive to being respectful or them because I know working with the public is really hard).  The egg/chicken dish I ordered was slimy and there were odd pieces of bone in the mystery cuts of chicken. The tortillas were burned and greasy. The glasses/coffee cups were dirty and there wasn't any cream for the coffee. Also the tables and chair were sticky. Please wipe them off!  Unless someone can convince me there has been a huge improvement, I will never go back. This is very sad because it was so terrific to start with and my kids loved the patio which is so fun.   It was fantastic for happy hour. They have had some great wines- especially the Klinker Brick.  Very sad."}
{"text":"I eat here often. I love the fact that there are no freezers. Everything is fresh. Breakfast pan cakes the size of your plate with apple compote. Yum!"}
{"text":"While waiting in line to order, an employee waved my friend and I over saying, \"I'll help you guys over here.\" Guys. Plural. He took my friend's order and then instantly wandered off, leaving me standing there wondering if he was coming back. He did not so I got in another line to order.   After fetching our own drinks, which we were not told we would have to do, we found the one available clean table in a sea of empty yet-to-be-cleaned tables. After about ten minutes, someone came to clean the tables around us, but just brushed the crumbs into the chairs and walked away. The tables were still visibly dirty.  The food was the only saving grace. I had the croque madame. My egg was cooked exactly as I ordered it. I enjoyed it a lot. It came with a \"side of fruit,\" that was more a garnish than a side: a tiny metal condiment container with one blackberry, a few tiny cubes of apple and two slices of grape.   None of the staff seem to be interested in delivering a great customer experience for any one there. I won't be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots, love the BLTA but everything I have ever ordered here is yummy.. All the food is fresh and served hot."}
{"text":"Happy to post an update on Hillside Spot- 3 years later!  My friend took me here and I didn't even remember that I had been here before. I thought the place was large and had a great patio (with a fireplace) and mood-dim lighting. Since I forgot about my previous experience, I didn't even think to order the pulled pork sandwich. Instead I got the Brooklyn Chop salad: romaine, salami, pistachios, radicchio, sundried tomatoes, cucumber, cotija, tomatoes, olives, and red wine vinaigrette. We also ordered draft beers that were $2 off as a Weekday special. My friend got a veggie burrito.  Our server was great and pretty speedy with the beers and food. The salad itself was tasty but not as flavorful as the description presented it to be: it was mostly salami and lettuce, I saw a tiny piece of pistachio and a whole olive but no sundried tomatoes, radicchio, cotija cheese, cucumbers or tomatoes. All in all, it was a decent salami and lettuce salad with a tangy dressing. My friend's veggie burrito was pretty average too- steamed veggies on a tortilla shell.  Happy that this place has gotten better in my eyes but its still not as amazing as it could be. However, the patio and ambiance is good enough to just come for beers and escape elsewhere for a good meal."}
{"text":"Prices pretty good. We ordered a couple breakfast items and they were both warm/cold. We let our waiter know and he took care of it right away! He sent back our ordera and they made them fresh. The food was really good and tasted fresh. The peach mimosa was good and my girlfriend got a beer. The waiter also gave us 2 drinks on him for the food being sent out like that. I appreciated the effort he put forth and because of him and the delicious food I would recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"When I first saw Hillside Spot, I thought it was a new coffee place. I guess I was a little predisposed to think so (there used to be a Coffee Plantation there). I was happy. I could use a non-Starbucks coffee place in my neighborhood.  Turns out destiny had something even better in mind.  I had lunch at Hillside this very afternoon. After pondering the options (not many), I decided on the pulled pork sandwich, which comes with their own special coleslaw - not on the side, but on the sandwich.  I don't like coleslaw. I do not like it on a plane. I will not eat it on a train. I would not touch it in rural Spain. Coleslaw is not my thing in the sense that burning off my own eyebrows is\"not my thing\".  But somehow the cashier talked me into trying it. And I am SO glad I did, because the sandwich was excellent. I washed it down with a bottle of Mexican Coke (the good stuff) and considered it an excellent lunch. I may just have to rethink my stance on coleslaw.  The restaurant is clean, well-lit, and just about perfect for a weekend breakfast or lunch. The tables aren't too crowded or too far apart, and it has a nice contemporary feel. I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! It's more like a casual cafe type of place but their food is delicious, healthy and affordable. They also have live music- yesterday was a young couple & they were good!  Went in around 7:00p and was a bit crowded but we were able to get an outdoor seating immediately (on a warm day I would totally recommend the outdoor patio).  Service was quick! We ordered and within minutes the food came out.  My friend and I shared the \"build your own grazers- American prosciutto w/fig jam & Brie w/tomato jam. The jams went well with the meat & cheese, so delicious!  For my entree I ordered the half salad half sandwich- asado salad & vegetable torta.  Both were good! The asado salad was like a Thai peanut salad. The vegetable torta was nice & warm; the bread was soft too.  For dessert we shared the red velvet cake- absolutely amazing!!  When we asked for the check, the waitress was able to split the check without a problem.   They also serve breakfast all day!! Who doesn't love breakfast for dinner?:)"}
{"text":"I love that this place has good coffee and offers almond milk (but wish they had coconut!); which is great since Ahwatukee needs to get with the times and have a lot more options for the crunchy/natural&organic/dairy-and-gluten-free crowd that is rapidly growing.  However, while they have a walk-in and take-out coffee bar, it is definitely a restaurant. There's no place to really just sit and chill. Restaurant-wise, it's a little loud, but i really like their breakfast options, which they serve all day, and they are reasonably priced.  I don't drink beer and I haven't been there for dinner, but I guess they have a lot of craft beers and wines.  I just wish there was a nice, shaded patio with misters and/or more of a sitting area for those that just want coffee."}
{"text":"Gem of the Ahwatukee/Chandler area! Loved it so much the first time, I went a second time that same week! First visit I had decided to try the CHILAQUILES VERDES which had layers of corn tortillas with mesquite cooked chicken, Oaxaca cheese, spicy green salsa (not too spicy for a wimp like me) & 2 sunny-side up eggs (which I requested scrambled). IT WAS HEAVEN WITH EACH BITE! My date had and loved the PULLED PORK SANDWICH which had the special recipe braised pork, slow cooked on our mesquite fired rotisserie, served on toasted telera bread and topped with their homemade, spicy cole slaw. UN-REAL! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! It was so yummy, from the taste or two I was given.   Second time we went was for breakfast. I had the \"El Gallo\" Torta with scrambled Eggs, chorizo, tomato & avocado and  mayo served on La Sonorense Telera bread. The chorizo was just spicy enough which I liked. The only thing that would have made the meal perfect was if the torta bread had been toasted (minor, I know). I also ordered a side of hashbrows which were seasoned to perfection and nice and crispy.  A new favorite place for sure! Can't wait to go back and order the pulled pork sandwich for myself!"}
{"text":"Can't stand this overrated place. Totally disorganized, mediocre food, the worst coffee you'll ever drink, and substandard service. Patio not dog friendly unless you have a service animal."}
{"text":"I love the city of Phoenix (at least in April), and this place is in a perfect spot. We were able to sit at a table outside and the weather and setting was perfect.  I ordered the regular pancakes with a side of bacon. Don't let the description fool you, it says the platter comes with only two pancakes, but they are gigantic! I was barely able to finish both of them with the bacon, and they were delicious. The decor is also really nice. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anybody."}
{"text":"I'm not a local but I stop by here almost every time I'm in town. It's easy to pickup some delicious food (and desserts shhhh...).  I like the outdoor seating to dine in some of the cooler months.  Note: The last time I was there I saw that they use Guittard chocolate in their desserts.. Guittard chocolate is made in my hometown in northern California and if you've ever had a SEE'S candy those are made strictly with the same stuff. I'd say it's a pretty quality place but maybe I'm just biased."}
{"text":"I've been there many times since they have opened but they atill just can't seem to get their act together.  This could be a great SPOT but it's just NOT.  Continue to be disappointed.  Service SLOW."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with their breakfast food. We came in on a Saturday morning and it was pretty busy. Started by ordering drinks - they don't carry any decaf coffee! For a breakfast joint not to offer an option of decaf coffee is pretty unheard of. For those of us who can't have caffeine or don't want to have caffeine, you will not be getting a cup of jo with your breakfast. My husband's cappuccino was good, but we've had better.   Now, onto the actual food. I ordered Farmer's omelet and my husband ordered El Jefe omelet. Farmer's was completely unseasoned to the point where it tasted so bland I would call it inedible. I called our waitress back and asked if they forgot to season it. She told me that we don't actually salt our food very much. I wasn't specifically talking about salt, but seasoning in general. I reiterated that there is zero seasoning in my food and it tastes very bland, and she offered me salsa in return. Salsa helped, but then all I could taste was the salsa.  After it was all done I walked away very unsatisfied with my food.  El Jefe was better, but again, not something to write home about. The toast that it came with was also pretty bland. Overall I think they are going for minimal clean ingredients, but ultimately failed at it because they served us food that tastes bad. Healthy food doesn't have to taste bland."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The HUGE selection of craft beers and micro they have available makes this a unique place to grab a bite. the food is excellent and the staff is always great! When they have their BBQ going, it is hard to drive by and not stop.  Lunch and Dinner are recommended. Haven't been for breakfast."}
{"text":"My family has eaten her several times and we have been pleased every time. Tonight they went above and beyond. I have celiacs and every time they are great about it. However, tonight I was even more impressed I am breastfeeding and need to dairy free as well. The waitress helped me find a meal that was gluten free and dairy free. It was just as good as normal too! I would recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"Outstanding food!! Great, fresh, local, creative, unusual and tasty combinations. Service was good. Loved the patio on a nice sunny day! Unusual open commercial kitchen in the middle of the restaurant.  Prices are reasonable. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend. Walked in and checked out the menu - all sounded really good so decided to give it a try. Good in theory. Execution is another story. My food was not too good. I got the breakfast burrito with chorizo. Very little egg, too much chorizo which got old fast and the \"potatoes\" inside it were leftover french fries!!!  OMG - talk about a lazy substitution and a misdirection from the menu description. The tortilla my burrito was made with was also not great tasting and in the end, I literally just ate the insides of the burrito and left the entire tortilla on the plate. I also got a side order of a pancake with apple compote. This was recommendation from my pretty but poor excuse of a server. The pancake on its own had NO flavor. The apple 'compote' was a couple of flavorless, weird colored apples with the skin still on!  If it wasn't for the syrup, there would be no flavor to this $5 extra item.  In all, I paid a pretty penny and was left very disappointed.    My server was also a disappointment. She spent most of her time chatting with 2 girlfriends at the bar/pub area, letting my food sit for a bit. I could see all this and she didn't seem fazed. Then when she took my order, she never wrote it down and originally my burrito had to be remade because of her inaccurate placement of my order.  The server never asked me how my food was, didn't seem to notice I did not eat the tortilla portion at all. Didn't seem to care.  This was my first impression, first time at this restaurant.  It seemed to be a find when I first viewed the menu. Not your typical chain, some different types of food, but the execution of the food and the lackluster service made this a no go in the future."}
{"text":"Really wonderful - for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  Love the outdoor fireplace, the vibe, how they source local foods, how Everything is made on premises but... often WAY too loud and yes... the flies."}
{"text":"I've come here for breakfast a couple times. Service is always good and I like that it's a local place with good ingredients. I like to get the lox and levain open-face sandwich."}
{"text":"Great food, But patio furniture sucks. Makes for an uncomfortable and dirty kind of feeling. Now I was there about a month ago so I'm not sure if they got new furniture but overall awesome worth another visit"}
{"text":"Looking for good Huevos Rancheros one Sunday morning and ran into the the Hillside Spot. Place was pretty busy but was seated quickly. Huevos Rancheros weren't exactly what I was looking for but they were still good. Chili Verde was a little tart but worked well with the eggs and tortillas underneath. I will go back to try the Chilaquiles. Stay tuned for that review.."}
{"text":"After a long hike nothing is better than good food, friendly waiters and something cold to drink.  Found Hillside Cafe today after friends told us about it.  Inside and outside covered seating.  Market attached which is great if you want to pick up food fast and go. This place is always crowed so come early if you want a fabulous breakfast.The only set back is the one women who seats you with glasses can be a little nasty.  I watched her put people on the bottom of the list when they didn't want to eat outside .  If that happens go to the manager who is a doll.  The food is always fresh and served as requested. Would I go back  we have multiple times."}
{"text":"SHORT AND SWEET: Came for lunch on a Saturday at noon. It wasn't busy when we got there, was seated right away, but around 1pm it started getting crowded, the service was good, the food was delicious (pear, blue cheese salad ordered and it was fantastic!) the coffee was very good too. GREAT PLACE, cool ambiance. The End."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood family friendly spot! The food is always fresh and the beer and wine selection is fantastic. The servers and bartenders are personal and welcoming. I live walking in and being greeted by Taylor, Madison,  and Jeremy!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service in a convenient location to South Mountain.  Great place for a weekend breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere. However, the quality of the food is inconsistent. That is something that needs improvement. I would still recommend it though, because it's such a nice place to sit and relax."}
{"text":"Very nice and busy neighbourhood breakfast place.  Closest comparison I can think of for such a busy place would be Liberty Market in Gilbert.  I had the Corque Madame.  Its was well done with the right amount of cheese and ham and the fried egg was good.  I was a little disappointed that the only side it comes with was just a fruit cup, but then, what kind of sides do U give to a carb heavy sliced of bread anyway ?  I guess fruit is the best choice in this case.  I saw the Huevos Rancheros my friend ordered, he liked it very much too, the server even offered him a side of a spicier salsa when he asked if the sauce was gonna be spicy.  He does have one little query, why does it not come with beans ?  It comes with potatoes and a fruit cup too but we asked the server about it and he says, they usually don't serve beans with huevos rancheros.  But those are two small things that did not affect my overall experience by too much.  Because based on what they cooked and offered, the food was well made and very tasty.    I will definitely be back again because the coffee is really good (no longer cartel but also a local brand, expressions), service is excellent and food is well prepared.  I don't know what kind of service the other people here received but we had a very good server who kept coming back to refill our coffee.  I did see that the table next to us with a different server were visibly displeased when their server was too busy running around to refill their coffees often enough.  Also the server did come over and apologize to them, when we got our food before them, though we got in behind them.  I guess you can't control the kitchen and maybe the server was a little younger than our server, thus might have appeared a little more rushed, but I dun recall him being rude or away for too long.  Their coffee cups stayed half full most of the time still.  I will need to come back again to sample the other food choices, apparently they serve a good dinner too.  I guess it would be prudent to come earlier here on sunday for brunch as the farmer's market in the corner brings in a big walking crowd.  I imagine on saturday it would be pretty packed too."}
{"text":"Great food. Fresh and very tasty. Would have given 5 stars but the service was bad. They need to invest in training their staff properly."}
{"text":"I can't believe the rating here!  We come to hillside almost every Friday, have tried a good bulk of the menu, and it is fantastic! Our favorites are the jefe omelette, the chilaquiles, the levain toast, and the tacos. Oh and the croque madame and the street corn. Their oatmeal is fantastic too... if you order a side of fruit you get the GOOD fruit, no water-logged cantaloupe infecting your strawberries. :)  The service has always been wonderful and we love the atmosphere. Seriously don't understand how this place could get a bad rating... I could bathe in their tomatillo salsa and my boyfriend always enters some other dimension while he's eating his jefe omelette it's that good."}
{"text":"We go for the mimosas in the morning (delish!) and the kids eat free (after 4pm) specials as night. I love the indie-vibe this restaurant exudes, while my husband loves the fact that there are so many local beers on tap.  Well done."}
{"text":"I've been to Hillside Spot a few times since they opened, but it's quite a haul from my home to get there. I made the trip Sunday and was sorely disappointed in everything except the service, which is the only reason this review is a 2 star and not just 1.   I ordered a burger and asked that it be cooked medium. Easy, right? Well, no. After quite a long wait (about 30 minutes, but it was quite busy, so that wasn't such a big deal to me), I got a well done, over cooked burger that was burned around the edges. My first thought was how in the world could such a horrible burger make it out of the kitchen? The chef should never have let that food leave the kitchen. The server should have been told the kitchen screwed up and then fix it. But no, that didn't happen.  Our server, Alexa, got right on the replacement. A manager came by and I tried to help him understand that the burger I got should never have made it out of the kitchen. Rather than take responsibility, he offered excuses about how busy they were.   When Alexa brought my replacement, the burger was almost rare. It was as if the kitchen was making a point...take the burger as we give it to you or you'll get it raw. It was done enough around the edges for me to nibble, but I didn't eat much of the burger. Thankfully, Alexa took the burger off our bill (but I did leave her a generous tip since she was the saving grace in this experience).  I don't know what's going on in the kitchen, but shame on the chef and the kitchen staff for not being able to deliver a burger cooked to medium perfection. I'd had burgers there before and I remembered loving the burger! But my experience yesterday showed a complete failure in both the kitchen AND management. It's as if the customer's experience didn't matter at all to the kitchen and didn't matter much to the manager.   Oh, and the omelet my friend ordered...well, I'd have sent that back too. It was dry and looked horrible to me. The omelet was supposed to have had goat cheese on it, but she could only find one little chunk of goat cheese on it. The mushrooms from my mushroom swiss burger helped make her omelet more appealing. This was her first experience at the Hillside Spot. Quite frankly, I was embarrassed at the whole experience....I took a friend to what I thought was a great restaurant, only to have a horrid experience. If y'all ever get your kitchen back in working order, feel free to reach out...maybe I'll try you again. But for now, given all the other recent bad reviews, I'll spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Place was nice especially sitting outside having lunch, first it did a take a while to get menus and asked for drinks, once we got a server he was really nice and I ordered a IPA and tired tricerahops for the first time and it was delicious and after that I had a ballast point sculpin IPA witch is one of my favorites, me and my girlfriend ordered the brisket Mac and cheese and it was okay but bland, ended up wanting more food after we were done and ordered a bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious! It was a nice lunch and enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"After several so-so visits, this one was finally decent primarily because the huevos rancheros was delish. Service was still lacking (slow and inattentive) and the kitchen always seems slow getting food out. My biggest complaint is the ridiculously large fake fica tree that takes up about 1/6 of the floor space. Tables are squeezed tightly together to make room for this monstrosity which requires servers and customers to engage in an impromptu game of limbo to get around it. It really needs to go.  I do hold out hope for this place and the huge patio has a lot of potential. With the right furniture and shade the patio could really be on par with the Vig."}
{"text":"I ordered the flaco burrito expecting it to satisfy me while being the healthier choice, but it was beyond delicious. So happy that I got something healthy AND awesome. The tortillas are the best!"}
{"text":"The food at Hillside Spot is wonderful-- I've enjoyed both breakfast and lunch there a few times. However, the service is enough to make me not want to eat there anymore. Other Yelpers have described their service as \"slow and disorganized,\" and that pretty much sums it up. It's a shame, because the atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy and cheerful and the food is delicious. The service is just not what it should be. I expect more."}
{"text":"Called ahead to confirm pet friendly, was told we could sit on the patio. Made arrangements with friends to meet there. Got to restaurant and was told that actually unless our 5 lb dog was a service dog, we could sit at a little table on the sidewalk, but couldn't sit on the patio. Understandably, they don't have a permit for that. So, my Mother sat outside of the open gate with the dog, while the rest of our party sat on the patio, because there wasn't room for a party of 8 on the sidewalk. Patio was nice, food was ok. Got a \"fancy\" burger, but it was over cooked and flavorless. Grilled cheese bread was over toasted and hard, kids cheeseburgers were over cooked. Service by waiter was good, hostess and I believe the manager were nice, but miscommunication was an issue. Maybe I just had my hopes set too high. Prices were good. 5 adults and 3 kids only $69."}
{"text":"I love Hillside! Quaint and hip! Food is great and service is great too. It's busy on the weekends so plan accordingly! (Busy because it's awesome)"}
{"text":"I would actaully like to give another half star here, but haven't figured out how to do that. It's completely worth supporting this place - if you've read my other revues, you know I am a fan of supporting local food, and this place does a good job of providing that. I gave it 3 1/2 stars because it's hit or miss. I've been when the food is great and the drinks are great and the staff is really friendly. Then I've had days when no one helps me for a really long time (but walk by and look at me) ;), and the coffee was not so great tasting or the food was a little off. But I continue to go often. Usually their coffee is yummy, their pastries are always delicious, a man who I believe was the owner was very nice, and the tunisian salad (chicken added) was mouth watering (and that's a salad!)"}
{"text":"How did I not try this place sooner?!  Living literally 5 minutes tops from Hillside Spot, I drove by many times and never really knew what this place was.  Man was I glad I finally got to see.  Mixed between a coffee shop, breakfast joint and bar. this place has a lot to offer not to mention a mellow laid back atmosphere that I enjoyed.  The bar also looked like it had a pretty respectable selection of draft beers.    The bacon and cheese omelet I ordered was great and also had a refreshing selection of fruit to accompany it.    This is a nice spot in Ahwatukee that I will definitely try again."}
{"text":"Food at Hillside is always super tasty. I think pricing is a bit high sometimes but considering they use local farmers and such it's a good spend. I loved when they had live music on the patio."}
{"text":"You know, Hillside really went downhill (unintended pun). It's to the point where I no longer eat there and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It used to be one of my go-to \"spots\" and I was very hyped up about the place. However, the quality of the food declined...badly. I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt and say, \"Well, maybe the last couple of times I was there they were just having 'off' days.\" But, it was those \"off\" days that don't really make me want to return. I hope they can turn it around, because Hillside showed so much promise early on."}
{"text":"Came here to give it another try. Food is good, service is always poor.  Very slow service with no character.   Done giving this place a chance."}
{"text":"we have eaten here several times, friends like it, and I find it ok.  service is always a bit questionable, slow, and a bit out of synch including the delivery of dishes to a party of 6 - team delivery possible instead of one waiter?  my group likes the patio seating but it seems stark...they need a creative person to give t some character.  had the homemade pasta with chicken - good dish."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spots to eat in Ahwatukee. They have incredible breakfast burritos and other dishes for breakfast. Their Suki's Rice Bowl is probably one of my favorite dishes anywhere. They also have great tacos, burgers, and more. I have had one or two dishes that were only ok but that has been rare. The service is always pretty friendly as well. They also have a great craft beer menu with a mix of local and non-local beers.  Definitely one of the best in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Love this place. Close to my work. My collegues and I adore this place. My husband thinks its swish too. Delicious sandwiches and salads. My favorite is the croque madame- perfection every time. The sauce they use on it is brilliant. The coffee is nice and hot and pretty good for a plain old cup- but they do have a full service expresso cafe if you want something a bit fancier! The bakery sweets look yummy too but I havent tried them yet- but there is always next time! Service is friendly and prompt. It looks like they have a variety of beers and wines too if that is what you look for.  Atmosphere is bright yet relaxing and chill. This is one of my favorite breakfast spots."}
{"text":"Visited twice now, and the food and atmosphere was amazing both times. Favorite place in the valley!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing...   I have been coming here for years and the quality has been consistently declining. Today may have been the final straw.   The last time I was here was with my girlfriend. We were seated on a hot day at the only table receiving full sun. The table was also rickety. When asked about moving the table or going to any of the other empty tables in the shade, we were told it was okay if we moved the table our selves.... Okay... The server was very nice, but very slow and forgetful. We ordered a coffee and a side of jam with the food. It took about 25 minutes for the food to arrive which is reasonable, but the server didn't check back once in this time. When the food arrived, no jam and still no coffee... fine it happens, not a big deal. So we ask the food runner to let our server know about the missing items... 10 minutes later she stops by, and we let HER know about the missing items. She scampers off and it is literally the last time we see her. About 5 minutes later the coffee is dropped off by someone else, and...still no jam.   At this point we have eaten everything except for the toast. My girlfriend still wants the jam so we ask for that... it arrives about 5 minutes later again. We finish the toast in a couple minutes and sit with an empty table for another 10, Until the general manager stops by with the check for us. We let him know about the issues we had and he says one word, \"okay\". Leaves the check and walks away. Pathetic.    To be fair the food was really good. That time...  I should say that I have worked in restaurants for 10 years. I have worked as a server, a bartender, back of house, and management. Virtually every position. I am very understanding and very forgiving. I tip well and generally try to make the staffs lives easier.      Today I was sat at the bar and service was fast and friendly at first. I ordered the two egg breakfast. An item I have ordered a dozen times. The item I ordered in the story above in fact. Unfortunately, the toast came out almost soggy. It was cooked on the griddle on one sided only. The griddle side was soggy with butter and the other side was completely soft and uncooked. Not a big deal I think, it has never come out like this before. It always has some crispness to it, even if they \"toast\" it on the griddle.  A couple minutes later the general manager walks by and asks how the food was. I let him know about the toast. He says one word \"okay\", then turns around and calls back to the kitchen to get another order of toast. Sure enough it comes up exactly the way it came out before. The server checks back this time. I pick up the toast and show her how it bends in half if you hold it on one end. It is obviously greasy and soft.   I try to explain that I've never had it this way before and I'm really not feeling it. I suggest that they may need to check whats going on with the ingredients or the kitchen. Instead of asking what they could do to make it right, offer something else, or offer to take it off the bill, she looks at me annoyed and says \"Okay\". They didn't even apologize. The GM was standing behind her listening to this interaction the whole time. It's just pathetic. On top of it the rest of the breakfast was disappointing as well this time, for example the hash browns were soggy and barely warm.   I know how to run a top notch front of house staff. Keep them happy and make the customers come back. The whole time I was just itching to step in and start fixing their problems. It is clear that the problems in the staff are coming from the top. I sure the GM has plenty of talents, but running a half way decent front of house staff is not one of them.   Because I have had enough decent meals here I could be coxed into coming back, but it would probably take direct outreach from the GM or owner at this point."}
{"text":"Well I went back and Good news! The portions are bigger! And what actually brought me back was their coffee. What can I say I appreciate a place that serves good coffee! :)"}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Had the huevos racnhero's, disgusting. The cheese flavorless plastic, the salsa verde was soo damn salty. It was just BAD! I will never go back. Stay away. Not good at all."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer here, and the food is consistently really good.  For me, the breakfast menu in particular is amazing.  They have the best side order of bacon on the planet.  You get plenty of delicious, crispy bacon for the price.  The atmosphere is pretty good, but the clientele can be kind of annoying which is no fault of the establishment.  I go there for the food.  The bar stools are uncomfortable, and the service is inconsistent.  Some of the servers are fantastic, others mediocre--so depending on who you get the service can vary from great to not very good.  However, the food has been consistently very, very good.  In addition to the bacon, the omelets, breakfast burritos, burgers, sandwiches, and chorizo are all delicous.  The coffee is hit or miss though.  The bottom line is I don't know of a better place to have breakfast in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here recently with my hubby and any place related to LGO we are fans of.   The pancakes were gigantic and appley-super yummy. I'd love to go again soon to try something new but I have a feeling Liberty Market would be my first breakfast choice!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed with this place. Servers are great, atmosphere can't be beat and the food is of another level. Only spot I go to for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Their smoked ribs are excellent.  It is a very friendly, convenient place with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great salads and dinner entrees.  Breakfast is very busy though and I have gotten cold food.  Wish they were a little more consistent.  Great place for dinner since it's not as busy."}
{"text":"Really like the local menu and vibe.  Food is good and so is service. Wish there were more of them."}
{"text":"Hillside definitely hits the Spot!   There aren't too many great options for breakfast/lunch near my office at South Mountain, so I was thrilled to find that I really enjoy this place. I've gotten sandwiches to-go every time I've been here. I wish I've had the opportunity to sit down and eat here. Hillside is pretty sparse in terms of decor, but the restaurant has a very clean feel, and I love the open kitchen. There's always whole rotisserie chicken spinning over their grill. I've also seen whole tomatoes on the grill which gives the place a nice inviting smell throughout the restaurant.   They offer counter-service, and everyone who's ever helped me has been friendly. I've been offered coffee while I wait as well. My favorite sandwich is \"el gallo\" torta. In between the soft bread is avocado, chorizo mixed into the scrambled egg, tomato, and a bit of mayo. It is seriously what gets me out of bed some mornings. I also love that they use local ingredients and partner with local vendors. Their menu is also reasonably priced.   If it wasn't for the long drive back home, I'd like to give this happy hour a shot. They've got a pretty interesting wine selection I'd like to try, but I'm not sure how well that would go with my breakfast sandwich, or boss."}
{"text":"I am sad that it is always packed because ahwatukee is a wasteland of nothing but chains, so this place is dubbed hip and different, and thus continues to be packed every weekend with soccer moms and their families. As long as it is packed it won't change and it could be great. The service is almost non existent. Be prepared to wait for everything, starting with a hostess the minute you walk in. The last time I ate there I had to go get silver wear and a menu myself. The menu tries hard but doesn't quite make the mark and the prices are high. Finally, beware of the ever changing beer prices in the cooler near the entrance. Signs clearly mark that beers are 6 for $8.95, but some employees charge more for certain beers even though that are not marked as such. After spending my Father's Day morning trying to make a special six pack for my husband and getting denied even though signs are everywhere and they had not pulled these shenanigans for the same beers before, I will not be returning. The McDonalds in the parking lot would be better food and service."}
{"text":"Cool little neighborhood place. Great ingredients, very legit Croque Madame à l'ancienne with a béchamel sauce that's pretty close to being perfect. Sourdough bread was good. Avocado bread was perfect. Overall it's fresh and tasty, home style. If you are there, and it's time to eat breakfast, don't miss it."}
{"text":"Phone ordered, was told 10 to 15 mins to be ready to pick up.  Went there and was ignored for all the time of waiting: 10 mins or so.  Tried to be very patient and understandable 'cause I'm a nice dude.  But, I realized that I was a customer that ordered THEIR food.  My order was not started after I asked one of the staff who took my order on phone.    I'm a huge local biz supporter. Oh well, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place the atmosphere, the food, the service everything is always on par.  From looking at the photos from previous years it looks like they updated from a diner feel to a hipster coffee/ brewery type feel. I love the open kitchen design, you can see your foods being made fresh. Despite the design it doesn't smell like a diner so you don't leave needing to change your cloths. The service has a laid back and friendly feel but is always pretty speedy.  Sometimes we sit at that bar and that's always really nice and kind of fun too.  We love that this place is local and supports other local businesses.  The food? Always amazing. Healthy and more indulgent options to satisfy everyone. Plus there are a lot of create your own options to satisfy even the pickiest eater. My current fave is the farmers market omelet, the hubby loves the 3 dollar plate of bacon. Definitely stop here if your out in awatukee!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked at the low overall rating of Hillside Spot.  I think that I go on average 3 or 4 days each month and enjoy several hours working there.  The food is spectacular--granted I've only had their breakfast/brunch food items at this point, but the Croque Madame in particular is to die for.  The crepes as well are exceptionally good, and the coffee beverages are great.  They also have a very solid beer selection, not that I'm always drinking alcohol early in the day :)  Along with my review, my boss (a foodie from Maryland) insists on working at least one day at Hillside on her quarterly visits to AZ.  Seriously, SO good."}
{"text":"I love this spot for breakfast or lunch and the fact that they serve breakfast all day on the weekend is a big bonus!  The Blue Sky salad with chicken is my favorite salad and the Chicken sandwich El Quac is delicious as well. I've been told the burgers rock but haven't ventured there yet. I know the pulled pork sandwich  is good as well.   As for breakfast they have the best Farmers Omelette in town. I splurge and order it with whole eggs and it's quite delicious.   Always great service by a friendly staff and hard working manager."}
{"text":"I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!  I have been going to Hillside since it first opened...in fact, at least once weekly if not more.  I have had breakfast, lunch and dinner there countless numbers of times.  I have had meetings at Hillside and worked there for many hours at a time.  As well, I was part of a book club that met there weekly for quite a while (and we all ate meals).Yesterday, I was meeting with colleagues to have breakfast and work on a grant.   Three of us who all ate breakfast.  We were asked by Omar (manager or owner, not sure which) to NOT stay there an work because of the breakfast rush!  I AM APPALLED!!!!  My husband, 2 sons and I have spent easily several hundred dollars (if not thousands) there and eaten MANY MANY meals there since Hillside opened.  In fact this past week, I was there 3 times and ate meals on all three occasions.  To be told to not stay to work has me so angered and disillusioned that I will not be going back there!  I have become friends with several of the staff there and will greatly miss them...but I have been left to feel so unwelcomed by Omar and the management there!  (In fact, as I was leaving yesterday, I stood by the door to see if Omar would come and apologize to me...he looked at me: smiled and nodded and said nothing.  To say that I am disillusioned is an understatement!!!   I can be reached at hilarycummings@cox.net if you would like to connect with me!  NO HILLSIDE FOR ME!!!  ~Hilary Cummings"}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite lunch spots in the East Valley!  This place is a perfect blend of restaurant and bakery and everything on the menu is delicious.  If you enjoy breakfast, head to Hillside Spot for some awesome crepes or pancakes. If it's lunch time, I highly recommend the BBQ burger, literally one of the best burgers I've ever had. For a lighter version, substitute a smoked chicken breast filet for the burger patty and have a side of fresh fruit.   Absolutely delicious iced tea options! Awesome chips and salsa as well! Service is friendly, although sometimes a bit slow.  This place gets busy a lot. There is a reason for it.  Hillside Spot doesn't have the cleanest feel in the world, the restroom was messy and not stocked well.    Visit this place for an awesome lunch! If the weather is nice, ask to sit on the patio to avoid getting the smoker smell all over your clothes. You will not be disappointed in this place!"}
{"text":"Ok, I went back for dinner when they have full service. I much preferred the full service waiter, as I'm super lazy.  I also enjoyed the food on the dinner menu more than the breakfast stuff I had.  I shall give this place another go!"}
{"text":"I have tried to hold off on giving a review like this, but the Hillside Spot makes great food and has consistently the worst service I have ever been given.  Two days ago, my friend and I sat down, and were greeted fairly quickly by our waiter, he took our drink orders, quickly came back with what we had ordered, and then left us there for 10 minutes while he tinkered around the bar area, and conversed with his colleagues.  It wasn't until we left the patio and got in our cars until anyone had even recognized we were leaving (or maybe they forgot we were even out there, idk), we left enough money to pay for our drinks and peaced out.    Two months ago, I was there with a friend of mine, and her father.  At the end of our meal he requested some coffee (which is something MANY people drink after dinner), and the waiter informed us that they weren't serving coffee anymore because he had already turned the coffee pot off.  (Keep in mind, the restaurant was open for another hour, AND there is a full espresso bar there)  My friend's father asked if he would really in truly prefer having a customer go to the gas station across the street for coffee, and the terse response he got was, \"You can go anywhere you want for coffee, you are just not getting it here.\"  The only reasoning I could have had at the time was that it was because my friend's father is South African, and they just don't like dealing with tourists, but after the other night, it's official, THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST SERVICE EVER.  These people need to understand who gives them a job, whether or not the company as a whole is treating their staff like crap, and they're all disgruntled, i'm not sure, but they were definitely not overworked either time that I went in recently and received terrible service.  Their Flaco Torta is great, but that's why I gave them two stars."}
{"text":"Ate there last evening with the kiddos.  It was early (4 PM) and the place was nearly empty.  My daughter ordered the Derby salad with added grilled chicken.  She liked it, but it had too much Blue Cheese for her tastes.  The Blue Cheese was in really large chunks, and very tasty.  If you like Blue cheese, you will enjoy this salad.  The boy and I shared a cheeseburger and fries.  The burger was VERY good.  Puts it in the Top 7 or 8 burgers I've had in Phoenix.  Hard to say what was great about it - it just had a good charbroiled taste (nothing like Burger King's \"fake\" charbroil taste) and the ingredients melded well together.  The bun was also outstanding - toasted and crunchy on the burger side and freshly soft on the outside.  The fries were \"so-so.\"  We also shared the Guacamole and chips.  This was a weak point.  The chips were bland, and the Guaca was too chunky for dipping - you basically had to use a utensil and scoop the Guaca onto the chip to eat it.  The Guaca had I think little chunks of mandarin orange in there, which did nothing for the overall taste.  My son spit out his first bite and did not try it again.  A nice experiment, but I don't think a good one.  The kids drank Mexican bottled Coke, always a big fave.  All in all, we hit home runs on two of the three items, so that's a good percentage."}
{"text":"Food used to be excellent, now it is just ok. Not worth driving out of the way. My go to breakfast was the juevos, I had them today and they were just meh. The coffee was amazing, glad it had not changed. My husband had the farmers omelette and said it also was not as good as it used to be. Not work the drive up from Queen Creek."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in Ahwatukee. Amazing pancakes (try the hit the spot pancakes). Attentive/friendly service. The beer selection is hands down the best you're gonna see in town unless you want to make a trip to Bevmo. They also run different specials for lunch and dinner all the time that never disappoint."}
{"text":"Always a good breakfast, never had a fail. Have food challenges, so really enjoy El Jefe omelette and the Farmers Omelette, made with egg whites and veggies. Great hash browns, ask for them to be cooked well done, if that's your thing. Fruit is fresh, love the green iced tea. Servers have always been friendly, helpful and available. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This spot is fab! Fun industrial interior, micro brews are everywhere! There are always daily specials and everything is made fresh to order. Breakfast is my choice meal here. Choosing the ingredients for my breakfast sandwich I get exactly what I was craving. It's a little loud inside but their patio is a haven. Tucked away from the traffic of 48th st, fireplaces and spacious areas to dine or just hang out and enjoy. If you love oatmeal, THIS IS YOUR PLACE! A def MUST in the Tukke for any meal or gathering spot"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pancakes ever!!!  A rare gem indeed for the struggling Ahwatukee area.  Quality of their ingredients seems to be their greatest strength.  The Applewood smoked bacon was cooked to perfection.  Not greasy and I savored every bite.  Nice open feel to the dining area, with an adjoining take-out counter and outdoor dining for when our weather cools down.  The service was friendly and attentive.  My new fav breakfast spot in AZ..."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend after hiking South Mountain.  We both had breakfast items, burrito and omelet, both were delicious.  Service was outstanding! Will DEFINATELY be back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly. Atmosphere is very inviting as well. Food took a little bit but it was Mother's Day!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place with a grey atmosphere. However, the breakfast options are limited, for example there are no breakfast plates with pancakes and eggs you have to order them a la carte.  Also, the wait staff  didn't pay much attention either to me or to the people on either side of me (coffee cups went empty for most of the meal). The pancakes were flat and lacked flavor, even after being doused with butter and syrup. For the price I was charged I could of had the same breakfast at Ihop or Cracker Barrel with tip included and still had money left over. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"We went during brunch rush so service was slow but the food was good. I could tell everything was made from scratch. I had a burger and it was huge! The pancakes were very good too. I was a little disappointed in the salsa sampler because it lacked taste. I grabbed a few desserts on the way out and they were fresh and from scratch."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Had the build your own burritos, which were good. They do charge an extra $0.50 if you order additional salsa... kinda lame. Mimosa's were a good-sized pour, but also $8 a piece.  Green tomatillo salso is good - not spicy at all (although it says spicy on the menu), but good.   Good location and great ambiance. Went on a Sunday around 11am and had a 20 minute wait (ended up being less than that), so we headed over to the Farmers Market in the same parking lot - convenient way to kill some time.  Overall pretty good. Would head back if we were in the area."}
{"text":"Hillside spot has a great quality of food. However, it's very popular, so pretty much any time you go, there is going to be a wait. And not just at the front. It takes a long time for your servers to take your order once you are seated, and a long time for your food to come out once your order is taken. If they could move a little faster, this place would be a true gem."}
{"text":"Tonight was my last visit to the Hillside Spot, and here is why...  BAD/HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE BY IGNORANT MANAGEMENT/OWNERSHIP   Last weekend I called in an order for my fav - the el gallo breakfast burrito and paid to upgrade to the corn. When I pulled into my driveway I received a call from the manager telling me that he gave me someone else's order by accident, so there would be no corn. Okay fine no big deal ... I let it go.  This weekend I called in an order, and it seems like they hadn't changed up their features in a while, so I asked if they could do the brisket omelette for me, since they had a brisket sandwich on feature.   And when they had a brisket omelette on feature it was AMAZING!! Everything seemed fine, and they had done this before for me ... Typically they charged me the feature price, however, tonight there was once again ... more inconsistent behavior.  Apparently, the manager said to charge me for each item in the omelette separately, which increased the price to over $17 ...   QUESTION: what reasonable individual in their right mind is going to pay $17 for an omelette that normally cost them approximately $10/$11 in the past?  ANSWER: NO ONE ...BYE FELICIA!  I'm done w/ this place ... It's a joke.  Needless to say, I refused to pay that absurd price, and told them to keep it.   WTF is wrong with the management/ownership here!?!? Are you deliberately trying to sabatoge your own establishment, so people don't want to return?  MY ADVICE:  READ you're YELP REVIEWS and step it up before you end up going out of business!!"}
{"text":"This morning was my second experience at Hillside Spot. Both experiences have been mediocre at best. The first trip we attempted to order the Croque Madame as it comes and veg style. To our dismay we could not get the dish veg style because it comes completely pre-made w/ ham. For a spot that seemingly tales pride in specialty, local and quality, one would think their signature item would be made fresh to order.   The second visit consisted of below par juevos rancheros w/ soggy \"country potatoes\".  Let me clarify, country potatoes are supposed to be diced potatoes usually fried or baked w/ butter or oil. These were hash browns and nothing more...  Lastly, the wait staff was dull and uninviting. There didn't seem to be any communication between the staff whatsoever. The table in front of us sat in different stages of dirty for the better part of 15 minutes while every server/busser passed by, glancing each time.   The space itself is lovely. Reclaimed wood, lots of sun, and calming colors. This is a place I may come back to just have an early morning coffee and work, although the coffee is nothing to write home about.  Oh, and on the way out several staff directly looked at us and didn't see us off... I mean I understand if you are busy but they were far from it."}
{"text":"Food good. Toast was a joke. Looked like the generic store brand. Hopefully the server is new cause he sucks. No beer list. This wouldn't be one of my choices to come for food."}
{"text":"If your looking for fair priced items on Ahwatukee area, this is it. Loved eating in the patio, food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Just got back from this restaurant. I used to frequent this place often and always enjoyed it. Not this time and probably won't return.  I understand they were very busy however it seems obvious they never bothered to clean their utensils or cookware. I ordered a cheddar omelet. It came with pieces of bacon attached, a couple of beans inside the omelet, and just extremely greasy. Obviously they just threw the eggs in a pan that had been used before cleaning it. Not good. I would rather wait a little bit longer to have a descent omelet than get served what I did. Btw the coffee cup also had a streak of coffee stain on the outside. Makes me wonder what else goes on in their kitchen."}
{"text":"I want to give this place more stars but the wait staff just brings me down. The menu is unique and tasty. I just cant get past the customer service. I have been here numerous times on Saturday and Sunday mornings when the volume is high. After the long but expected wait, you will sit at your table for another 15 minutes before server comes by just to tell you they will be back in just a few minutes. Beware of ordering a specialty coffee or tea. It may or may not come and if it does, it will be at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"No online menu to check for allergens.  It's 2017 - get with the program.  I emailed them a week ago requesting this, no reply."}
{"text":"Food amazing. Fact they serve breakfast all day is awesome. But the service is inconsistent and my biggest gripe is the place is sometimes fly infested. I've had a couple occasions where it is SO bad that I've asked them to box up the food and took it home. They are located right next to an Ace Hardware so how hard can it be to get some fly strips to keep them away from your patrons and food. Or get the darn place fumigated. It's because of this that whenever someone recommends the Hillside that I cringe on what kind of experience will it be this time. Sitting in here right now and already getting depressed as we are being nagged by flies as were awaiting our table."}
{"text":"Warning! Do not order a hamburger with cheese. Wow! That was probably the worst burger I've tasted. Props for grinding their own meat daily but its meaningless without seasoning. Okay fries now, they were good although not great enough to win an award. On the other hand my girlfriends plate is the reason for the first and second star. The crepe with honey and nutella is a must try; it just goes together. The third star goes to the service. They were quick, nice, and unique. I'm excited to go be back there to try something else thanks to the crepe till then Stay tune on more reviews from me because im back baby"}
{"text":"A suburban prisoner... er... a friend of mine who lives in Tukee insisted I venture out from downtown to try this place. It was worth the drive, so I forgive him. I definitely appreciate the use of fresh, high-quality ingredients from local Arizona farms. The prices are good. The atmosphere is a bit on the chaotic side since there is no table service."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service.  Try their Ben Slaw burger, really good!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!! The food is fantastic and very reasonable in price. They have a very nice happy hour that only entices you to come and eat there, with wine and beer specials plus some munchies. The inside is warm and inviting with a friendly staff. The jewel is the outside fire pit that provides a wonderful environment to sit and talk with friends over good food and a nice draft beer or glass of wine."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh option in the ahwatukee area. I got a 1/2 sandwich 1/2 salad and it was delish. Maybe a little too healthy, next then I will try an entree and/or a desert."}
{"text":"Reasons to Heart: Breakfast All Day, Self-Serve Coffee, Modern Hip Decor, NYT, Cholula, Inter-generational Friendly  Reasons You May Dislike: BUTTER PARTY, Small Menu, Awkward Market, Bizarre Combo of Self-Serve/Service that is NOT Apparent, Kid Friendly  Reasons to Be Here: Your friends you lost to baby-making Suburbs, IKEA, You are Near the I-10 and Do Not Feel like Sushi, Ace Hardware, You want B-fest after 10:30am on a Weekday, Dad Wants Burger, you Want Organic Local yogurt/parfait  First time here with my friend's parents, as we walked up, I noticed an antique wooden bench with multiple kinds of newspapers, including NYT, held down by an old iron and an Open sign with neon on a skateboard. Whoa. What a liberal hip person coding of an entrance if I ever saw one! Inside, a bright modern airy space with concrete floors, exposed ceiling beams, bright green walls and exposed stainless steel industrial kitchen, I was super impressed by the brightness the huge windows gave the place as well as the cutting edge furniture. The menus are charming chalkboard options that have breakfast all day, kid's menu and lunch served after 11am. All priced between $4-$11, alas there are vegetarian options but this is NOT a butter free place. In fact, it is a fucking BUTTER PARTY. So get your LacTaid if you can do it!  The slightly hipster staff (the guys look like that dude who played Keats in Bright Star) are amiable at the counter but after ordering my garden veggie sammie I was dismayed to realize they had pastry cases hidden in the counter (you just basically look up the whole time then realize after swiping your debit card your other options). Also the drink menu is awkwardly displayed to the far right of the main menus (um, I would've wanted a soy latte instead of coffee...). After paying at the register, there is the bizarre scramble of figuring out what you have to get yourself.  There is a large bevy cooler that has wine, beer, soda, juice, water, etc and was a very healthy selection (not a poor one at all). Awkwardly placed is the water, iced tea and coffee station where people are trying to read the menu before ordering. Most tables are four person tables with two people seating around the windows and large community tables towards the L-shaped back, along with bar/counter seating that views the cooks station. Each time I went I ended up at the same four-person table near the condiment table stocked w/catsup, Sriracha, Cholula hot sauce (oh shit).   My first experience I got ginger beer and a veggie sandwich. Now, as a vegetarian for over 12 years, and a lactose-intolerant for over 5 years, my expectations were way low. Instead, I was fucking IMPRESSED. The bread ended up soggy due to the herbs mayonaisse cream dill sauce thing with incredible local roasted veggies with really good bread. OMFG. I mean seriously, I can't remember much of the meal cause my brain went somewhere spiritual. I also got the fresh fruit on the side, and a great deal with fresh berries, grapes, kiwi, etc. I managed to fit it all in my tummy (and felt def. overstuffed-I should've kept 1/2 of it). My companions had the pulled pork sandwich and killed it, the other had pancakes.  Today, I woke up and I wanted breakfest. Not Essence, Gallo Blanco, Lux, Wildflower, def. NOT Harlows, I wanted fancy pants American style breakfast I hadn't had a billion times before. Located right off the I-10, it's a fast drive from Tempe, and I didn't know what to expect for a crowd around 10:30 on a Tuesday. Turns out, Tim and I were def. the median age here. Mostly older patrons, couples, families, business deals, co-workers, moms with toddlers (they have plenty of nice high-chairs, btw). I had to get the pancakes ($6) w/fruit ($1) and side of potatoes ($3) and coffee. Tim got the rotassarie chicken with grilled corn and hand cut french fries (I think under $10). Seating was easy, food came out together within 15 minutes. The pancakes were delicate, almost crepe like, with a buttermilk taste but not too cinnamony and a little dry and thin (in a good way-sops up the butter and syrup). The serving of fruit on top was a little small, but all good quality, the potatoes were home-made style with sauted onions, skins still on.  His plate was huge with a grilled corn, the fries still had the skin on, and the chicken looked great and very greasy (which he killed). We had to remember to get our own utensils, napkins, and our own drinks but the staff checked in periodically and after finishing our plates, the dirty dishes sat around for 5 minutes, I believe due to the insane lunch rush that came in! Seriously, the place exploded! I was happy Tim had bought the cookies he eyed earlier so we skidaddled after using the nice, clean bathrooms.   Now, eating yummers Blondie cookie and chocolate chip cookies that are greased through the paper bag, I think I will have to ride my bike here to justify the butter party celebration!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family. As I was eating my BBQ brisket sandwich, I bit into a rock. I took it up to the \"owner \" omar. He told me he would take care of it. Two weeks later, no word."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place.  I remember when it was a Coffee Plantation, and it's great to see it's been replaced with a hip little joint.  I visit here in the mornings with my girlfriends for coffee after a work out, and I'll sometimes grab an egg white omelet.  The service here is top notch - we've gotten to know the staff to the point where they just bring out our usual drinks.  They're always quick with a refill!   I would really love to come in for dinner sometime - the menu looks fantastic and the beer selection is large and varied.  It's great having such an exceptional spot to grab a bite or drink in Tukee. I'm a big fan!"}
{"text":"Here me out before you agree or disagree! The food and service here is great... Actually for the price it was really good! I am 10 year 3 time Iraqi veteran, my wife and I have vowed not to support businesses that do not support military, this place does not give military discount! :-( so sad!   Bird poop all over the patio a little gross."}
{"text":"OMG the chilequillas are wonderful here! But if you come during evening hours wear a headlamp, it's dim. Ok, maybe romantic ambiance... Ask for Tucker as your server... He's sweet. Don't know about the desserts because they ran out the night I was there.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Nice setting, good food, and good service. A nice place if you're looking for fairly uninteresting but tasty brunch-y food in the company of friends. In particular, they make a consistently good smoked chicken that is both flavorful and succulent."}
{"text":"I will start with positives in the hope that a manager or owner who reads this will take it as true constructive feedback.   The atmosphere of this place is great.  I love that the music is a little loud sometimes, not all the times. I love the choice of music.  I love the big open feel and the amazing patio.  The concept of what is trying to happen here is great.  Local, fresh organic menu, and a simple (although never changing) menu at that. It brings character and a very urban feel in to Ahwatukee, which, for all intense and purposes completely lacks.  The Gallo Torta is phenomenal.  3 stars  I have been coming here for 2-3 times a week for the last 6 months.  I've had dinner and many a breakfast here.   Almost every single time I have been here, the thought has crossed my mind, \"the service is so bad here\".  There is a pretty regular rotation of 4-5 people who work the counter, taking my money.  I don't think a single one of them has ever looked at me in the eye.  No one here but maybe the taller woman, who looks like an owner, looks at people, smiles and says hello?  Its the craziest thing I've ever seen.  You are in Ahwatukee! not downtown SF...   I have asked on several occasions if I could deviate from the menu and create a egg scramble with the ingredients that are all already on the menu. Every time I am met with, \"huh, oh.. well yeah. I guess you could.\" then me, \"are you sure?\", them \" uhhh, well.... yea. I mean... i yea... I guess.\"  me \"Ok.. I ll just have the gallo torta\". \"Ok.\"     I am a regular! and the request is simple.. sheesh! Another thing.  Your cartel coffee coffee situation is in desperate need of attention.  You have like two barista's that make espresso in two totally different ways, and both are miserable. You have all the tools to make great coffee yet you don't.  The house coffee is seemingly very watered down as well. But this is a matter of my own preference and maybe isn't relevant here.   The place is always busy and I'm sure will be financially successful for years to come.  However, as I sit here writing this inside hillside spot, I believe this will be my last visit here.  Thanks for all the wifi."}
{"text":"love the pancakes.  just took the nieces out they had chocolate chips and chocolaate syrp on the side...they must take after their favorite auntie  who send them back to the parents with the sugar buzzz"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. The Ahwatukee area is always desperately in deed of better dining establishments, so with this new glass walled and open restaurant my hopes were high for a nice new local establishment. While the menu looks pretty good (I think breakfast might be the only saving grace here) the lighting for dinner, the service and the food were all exceedingly below par.  On a positive note the wi-fi and power outlets are a great add on, but they need to fix the food and service part and then they could have a winner."}
{"text":"I was recently at Hillside Spot for dinner and it was so good, I returned 2 more times within 10 days!  The wait staff was helpful and friendly and the food was delicious.  I had the roast chicken, which was a half a chicken!  I love the pulled pork and I also had the Brooklyn salad.  I will definitely be returning and bringing friends with me!"}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy this place. Food and service is usually solid and the atmosphere is great!   One thing though, they have Ketchup, Tabasco, and Cholula on their tabletop. I have requested in the past and have been told that A1 sauce isn't available. I am a simple man and enjoy it on burgers and steaks. I like their NY strip and am always left questioning why this condiment isn't offered."}
{"text":"Hillside has a very relaxed atmosphere, with good food and a respectable beer selection. Im definitely going to go back and try out other meals. The pulled pork was a solid choice. I think some reviewers just like to complain, try it for yourself and form your own opinion."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars...but rude service from management has now taken hillside off of our list.  They don't know how to handle the basic restaurant logistics of seating and wait times when things get busy, and instead of owning that and being apologetic you can expect them to look right through you or be directly rude.  Good luck guys. You've got a good thing if you can figure out that your customers are the reason you have a business. -by the way one can find great service, air conditioning that actually works and be seated immediately just across the i10 @crackers"}
{"text":"Another yelp bookmarked place I've been wanting to try and finally had the chance to come eat here. My family and I came in for breakfast and we were seated right away. I liked the vibe of the restaurant and saw that they offered a variety of craft beer . I got the El hefe omelet which had chorizo and veggies with a side of sourdough toast. My husband got one of the Torta breakfast sandwiches with a side of potatoes. My omelet was good but my toast was super hard and it didn't come with any butter. Also it would have been nice if my omelet came with a side of salsa but they had hot sauce on the table so it wasn't to bad. The torta sandwich was filling and my husband enjoyed it. I wasn't a fan of their potato and glad I didn't order any. It looked fresh but it was super Stringy looking and no flavor."}
{"text":"Delicious huevos rancheros.  Nummy tortilla.  Very busy, so there 's a wait Sundays.  Breakfast burrito had great flavor where the chorizo did not have to carry the taste."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local spots! I've been coming here for awhile now and love everything about it. My favorite thing to order is the spot chop salads, pulled pork sandwich, tuna sandwich and their chips and salsa. They also have an amazing beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here and each time I have been in the staff is super friendly. I have been for breakfast and lunch and plan to try Happy Hour next time.  The food is great, from the garden omelet to the kale salad!  Looking forward to happy hour!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times and plan to keep going as i have high hopes. I like the atmosphere -nice patio and can't wait for live music. Both service and food a bit uneven. The 50/50 sandwich/.salad is a nice option. Salads are interesting but sometimes dressing seems watery and lacks taste. I rarely eat beef except for here as the carne asada is tasty and burgers are cooked to order. My greatest complaint is that the iced tea always tastes stale.  That is my marker for a good restaurant so i am hoping they figure that out."}
{"text":"Beyond disappointed. I've been coming here for quite sometime and the service has slowly gotten worse every time. My visit yesterday will be my last.   Arrived around 9:15 the place was busy but not packed. Took 15 minutes to get menus and over 30 minutes to get hot tea. I had to ask twice and when I had to ask a different waiter he seemed very bothered and I said \"I'm sorry but should it take over 30 minutes and asking twice to get my drink\" his response was \"I guess so\". Tea was delivered 2 minutes later with lukewarm water & no apology.   When my food arrived, I asked the server for tomatillo salsa as that's what I had ordered and they brought me fire roasted. The servers response was to argue, continually that it was tomatillo \"it's just not as green and that's all we have do you want it or not\" then behind her came our server with the tomatillo salsa, the other server who stood there and scolded me about how she knew their salsa turned and stormed off, no apology for the confusion.   My mom ordered the chorizo scrabble, the chorizo amount delivered could & did (we were curious) fit exactly on a tablespoon. Looks like they are running out?    I've really tried to support hillside as I love the atmosphere and going to local businesses but you guys seriously need to get it together and make some drastic changes! I can't tell you one person who I've taken there in the last year and has had a good experience. Your food quality is going down, your service is slow and the staff is beyond rude, consistently!   In reading your yelp reviews, your management should be seeing the trend. You don't respond to your customers and in person I have never once had a manager come out to fix the problem. This tells me that your staff is a direct reflection of the ownership."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place for breakfast in Ahwatukee. The staff was very friendly and service was prompt. The restaurant is well kept inside and they have a good breakfast menu.   The farmers omelette was a great portion size. The eggs were cooked properly and it was filled with fresh vegetables. The salsa was excellent and had a great kick if you like spicy things. The coffee was decent for a breakfast place."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place at all. They are always packed so I thought it would be worth checking out...I was wrong. When we went it was not terribly busy as it normally is. Our service was horrible!! It took our waitress about 30 mins to even come back to take our order. I even flagged someone down to take it. The food was...eh...okay. If you are looking for larger portions...don't come here. It is expensive for what you get. I do like that they use local products, which I support. From start to finish we were there for well over an hour and a half, most of the time just waiting. It was awful. The staff acted like we were a bother to them. When I asked a girl if she could help she told me that we were not one of her tables but she would try to find someone. So, needless to say we won't be returning. It's too bad because I had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"My Son went to Hillside Spot today the tables and chair were dirty,  they had to find a table that was clean.   The waitresses were disrespectful and not doing their job (customer satisfaction) on top everything he ordered guacamole to-go  without Onions for his Elderly Great Cousin who is Allergic to Onions who ate the guacamole and had a Allergic Attack,  my Son called to talked,  who he said he was the Standing Manager and the manager told my Son that he made the mistake, when the customer went out of his way to order for an Elderly Allergic Cousin who was going to receive the Guacamole.  1 Star rating for Bad Customer service"}
{"text":"A nice break from the chains.  I hade a raspberry salad with chicken that was great and my mom had the burger which she really enjoyed.  One of my favorites in ahwatukee."}
{"text":"So we have tried breakfast and it is delicious! Except the bacon, it had a weird flavor to it, like old oil? I love bacon but didn't  finished mine.  I agree with most that the food is very good but the set up needs improvement. I'm very happy for them as the place is really popular, but can't understand why they haven't worked out the issues I and most people have mentioned on our reviews.  Also, being a family friendly/neighborhood place I was surprised they didn't had a changing table in the bathrooms. It's not that there's no space. At least in the women bathrooms there's plenty. I've been there for lunch and breakfast several times and there's always many families with babies and toddlers.   *3.7 stars*"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast.  Great coffee from Cartel.  We have been here twice and have read the disappointing reviews in recent months.  I really like businesses that buy local, and I love the MJ bread that is served.  I was disappointed that there was not a vegetarian option for the Croque Monsieur, but I asked for my eggs over medium with gruyere cheese and they were perfect!  That is not easy to cook.  My companion asked for a substitution of ham in his omelet, and it came out very nice.  They also added some fresh avocado with my vegetarian request.  As far as the wait staff, we found them to be just fine.  In our first visit I had to send back my plate, and there was no attitude in returning my plate.  Each time our plates came out fast.  The only thing I might comment on is that there was no check back after we received our food this time.  I use to wait tables and that is standard to check back as soon as the food goes out.  When I gestured to my coffee cup at the waiter from across the room he promptly came to fill it up, so I did not find the rude attitude that people wrote of.  Honestly, this place may have been a victim of it's own success and it may have misstepped with some of it's old customer base, but they seem to be on track now."}
{"text":"The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the staff. I think the food is good, environment is fine. It's very loud, so don't expect any intimate conversation.   Service was very slow on a few occasions and the wait-staff is a major hit or mis! If you get lucky, it will be fine, but some of the servers need to grow up and learn manners. It's just an OK place to me, nothing special"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times but after today,  not going back.  I expect to wait for a table, but expect to be greeted by my server sooner than 15 minutes after being seated! And even longer to get drinks and place order, and 35 minutes later got our food - for 2 people! No excuse! Although our server was very friendly, a quick word about why food was taking so long would have helped his tip. Food was ok but not great this time. Wish I would have made my own tastier breakfast instead of wasting $30 and 1 hour and 45 minutes plus drive time."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Have come here twice in the last two weeks or so. First time was for breakfast. Had the Croque Madame which was delicious, the only thing I didn't like was the tiny side of fruit it came with because it didn't look super appetizing so I didnt event touch that. They have a bar there too so I also had a mimosa which came with fresh squeezed oj.   Came again for dinner a week later and loved it again.  The grilled chicken was delicious, also had chips and quac for a snack that was good. Honestly I don't think you can really go wrong with anything on the menu. I really like this place its cute and casual and it has a nice rounded menu. Really anyone could find something in it to eat.  Will absolutely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Awesome place for a brunch in Ahwatukee!! Friendly service, cool interior, and yummy food! Try the green salsa!"}
{"text":"Ugh they changed their French fries and they are awful - used to have the best fries. Terribly disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The menu is quite eclectic in nature, so it will accommodate nearly everyone's taste buds.    I would highly recommend the Shrimp & Chorizo appetizer, the Croque Monsieur, and any burger on the menu."}
{"text":"Not sure when they changed the recipe for their burgers, but based on last nights experience I won't be ordering that again!  The burger was a thin, pre-made looking perfect circle that had no flavor and was bone dry.   Very disappoint in considering the burgers of old were fantastic.   As usual though, the guacamole was fresh and tasty with tasty chips.   And the side fries are always one of my favorites.   Just hold the burger next time."}
{"text":"Wish zero stars was an option. From the huffy attitude when we asked to be moved from where we were initially seated, to the cold and salty food, to the unaccommodating management attitude--this place has all the wrong stuff.  Ordered a breakfast entree and it showed up with essentially liquid, stone-cold eggs as well as cold chile sauce and room-temp chicken. Sent it back only to receive an order with tortillas so heated that they were burned and the allegedly over-easy eggs done rock-solid all the way through. And again the chile sauce was nearly cold, the chicken room temp and in short supply. I was so hungry that I consumed the nastiness only to find that halfway through, everything was already cold.  Now for the best (worst) part.  On receiving the check, the server explained that the entree would be \"comped.\" Well then, al least the management has a conscience, right? Wait. When I inspected the bill, I find TWO charges for my entree. They had actually charged me for both the entree I sent back and then one I ate, and then removed the charge for only one of the entrees. When I brought this to the server's attention, she consulted management, who removed half of the charge for the duplicate entree with the admonishment that this was \"the best that we can do.\"  We're done for good with this mediocre-at-best establishment. The best that we can do is never return."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this spot. Wish I discovered it sooner! I have yet to order anything and be disappointed. The Cubano and the Chilaquiles are my favorites so far. The dressing in the side salad is great.   The staff is pretty efficient and the environment is eclectic. One of my new favorite places to grab lunch."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Have eaten here several times and experienced breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Food is fresh and prepared with care!  Mia's pancakes are to die for!  One small issue noted...we sat at the counter at our last visit, which is fun because you get to watch the going-ons inside the kitchen.  We watched one of the chef's refilling a plastic squeeze bottle with some sort of sauce.  He carefully poured the contents into the bottle and I noticed that the top had dried, crusted sauce around the edge.  Sure enough, the chef finished pouring the sauce into the bottle, used his spatula to scrape the edges back into the bottle and put the top back on without wiping it.  Wish I hadn't seen that!  Guys...wipe the tops of the bottles before putting the tops back on!  They get crusty and gross."}
{"text":"Have lived in the area for almost 3 years yet never ate here because there's no online menu to view...however, decided to go today to take a chance. Very glad that we did. They serve breakfast all day - great & that's what we had. Partner had the Croque Monsieur and I had a 3 eggs 'build it' omelette with ham, gruyere cheese & green chilies with hash browns. Sat on the patio to enjoy the day. Service was efficient & pleasant. Food was hot, portions were a good size, well made & tasted very fresh. We thought the price was fair. Stopped on the way out & brought a mini lemon Bundt cake and a petite chocolate cake with raspberry filling for our dessert tonight.  Will be back again & will recommend to others. Thinking that Hillside Spot may become our 'go to' restaurant given our experience & the size/variety of their menu."}
{"text":"I like this place. Good if you are either in a group for a meal or alone to grab a snack and a coffee. The coffee is great, they got me my half caffeine without looking at me like an alien and the breakfast burrito was spot on. Overall a nice chilled place with cool decor and open kitchen.   Staff could make a little more effort with manners and customer service, however, I did not have an unpleasant experience because of this."}
{"text":"Trying to find a new Saturday brunch spot and this one was decent. We were first told we might have to wait 45 min for a table, we did have a group of six coming on a Saturday at just before noon then the host seemed a little annoyed when we asked to wait at three open spots at the bar while we were waiting (we were ordering mimosas and coffee so not sure what the fuss was about) but 45 min turned out to be more like 15 and not all of our party had arrived yet so it was prefect timing. Service was good, food was good. I wouldn't recommend the chips as a side choice. Despite being a little \"far from home\" I'd return."}
{"text":"Not a very warm or welcoming place by staff. Hostess never greeted us - we had to greet her. Never noticed anyone smiling. Place was fully staffed but maybe only half full with customers so not too busy. Took a long time to be acknowledged by the server after being seated. And then took forever just to get water to our table and again at the end for the check and a to-go box.   Was never asked how our meal was.  Who knows maybe staff was chewed out by management earlier in the day. Breakfast food was just so so. 24 bucks for two orders of under flavored pancakes. Been here couple of times already. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The food for the most part is good or better.  The wait staff is one of the worst in the area.  We've been going here on and off for a few years and the decline in service has really hit rock bottom lately.  Now not worth the effort.  Off the approved list."}
{"text":"Since service is such a huge part of the dining experience I have to give an abysmal score. We ate here in January and received absolutely no service. In fact, we had to get up from our table and track our server down when we needed something. No exaggeration, we saw our server when she took our order, had a food runner drop off the food and no one else ever came by. Additionally, the food runner dropped a portion of my brother's meal and it was never replaced. We couldn't even request a replacement (which we shouldn't have to do) because, again... no service. I tried reaching out to Hillside Spot as instructed on their website and I never received a response. Terrible service and management that can't even be bothered to respond to customers. That has earned them a customer that tells everyone she knows how terrible this place is."}
{"text":"If had breakfast at this Ahwatukee spot three days in a row. Weekends are busy but the hostess offered seating at the bar. We waited for a table. The chiliquilas were better than expected. The El Jefe was as advertised.  When I ordered the huevos rancheros I got a pancake on the side. The pancake was fantastic and the ranchero is salsa was great. Service was mentioned in previous posts it was good. Busy restaurants have longer ticket times for your meals on way a busy Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Glad to see you went back to counter ordering..  Like the matching shirts for servers..  Love the food and beer selection (croque madame is my favorite)..  Please please please do something about the flies.  they are ruining the place for me!"}
{"text":"Like other reviewers below, I waited it out for awhile before reviewing Hillside Spot. My husband and I were SO happy when they went in after our beloved Coffee Plantation left that we really wanted to give them a chance...  And now that we've been there separately, together, for take-out, sit-down, breakfast and lunch... I can honestly only give them 2 stars. It's horrible that I can't run over there for a salad when my kids insist on McDonald's because I know I'll wait forever and that my nearly $10 (with tax) salad won't have bacon or will be so small in its plastic to-go container so as to make me say \"never again\" and \"I'd rather pay $5 for the Grilled Banch Ranch Salad at McD's. Ugh, I hate that I just wrote that! But at least they have my food ready right away and NEVER forget the bacon.  My first experience was way back when they opened and I loved their pancakes with bananas and creme fraiche and peanuts, but the side of bacon wasn't quite cooked right (I should be able to request \"fatty bacon\" and not get snappy-crisp bacon, right?) but since then, every time I've had them since, it tastes like the batter wasn't mixed thoroughly and I taste the egg... if I wanted eggs, I'd order them. And I have. The farmer's veggie omelet has always been to my liking and the coffee is fine.  The croque moiseur is quite good as well.  But overall, I'll agree with many of the reviewers in that the quality does not quite justify the expense, especially when you consider the wait time (25 minutes for a to-go salad and there was no one ahead of me on line!) and the generally indifferent staff.  I don't plan on trying them for dinner because I'm assuming I will come away with the same \"meh\" feeling. Sorry."}
{"text":"Love coming here and bringing out of town friends.  I love getting chilaquiles verdes or a Croque Madame for breakfast.  I order the pulled pork sandwich for lunch-- it's topped with fresh Cole slaw and will change your life.  Patio is great on a nice day."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. EVERY time I visit during lunch the wait is 25 to 35 mins. Yet the restaurant has many empty tables inside and out. On today's visit, the cute little lady that handles the seating didn't greet me when I approached. Strike number one. I said hello and she didn't say a word. I stood there and said HELLO and waited for her to say something to me. She said hello and how many and if my preferred inside or out... I told her 2 and either and my name. Then I waited and watched as many people left the restaurant who were tired of waiting. As I stood there for at least 30 mins, I was in bird's eye view of an empty table. Just a step to the left and I could see others that were outside and inside yet I was still waiting... EVERYTIME I make the choice to go to this restaurant, I have the same experience. I'm watching money walk out of the door. I think this place offers a good product, it has a great concept but they need a good front house manager that can keep the customers moving. It's good but SHOULD be great. I love the small business restaurants that have their crap in order. This one needs some help. :("}
{"text":"Hillside is missing a couple things. Outside music and attentive service. Two things that make sitting on the patio on a Sunday, much, much better. Good service is a concious choice."}
{"text":"The reviews were so good that my friend and I had to check it out. We were very disappointed this morning while trying to eat breakfast and swatting tons of flies!!! They were everywhere, on us, our food, the other customers - and this was inside.  The egg sandwiches were served on hamburger buns shaped like rolls - I could have went next door to get one just like it at McDonalds.  Not surprised people from Ahwatukee like this place, it looks nice but the food is so-so."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast. There is inside and outside seating with  2 tables outside designated for you and your dog! Nice outdoor patio so we decided to sit there.  Our server Blake was on it! Asked about drinks then took our orders.  Everything pretty quick and flawless. Their orange juice is fresh squeezed and makes an awesome mimosa! If you love Bloody Mary's try their Michelada's!  They refer to their food as cafe classics with a southwestern spin and every entry meal has such unique spices and sauces. I do know from past experience service can be hit or miss so plan accordingly for a meal that might not be quick.    All in all come here for great southwest fare when not in a hurry!"}
{"text":"3 stars for now. Had breakfast and it was ok. No better or worse than most other breakfast joints but Hillside is more than a breakfast joint. Hillside is like the Swiss Army Knife of restaurants as they seem to offer a little bit of it all.  Good for small to medium size groups or individuals.  The atmosphere is the offspring of a restaurant, coffee spot, and bar after a drunken night of debauchery and no one knows who the parents are.  This place is definitely worth a second or third look during different times as the atmosphere seems like it changes throughout the day.  Like a mood ring, I suspect the color of Hillside will change depending on the patron.  So give Hillside a try, and see if this one size fits all fits you."}
{"text":"First off, the environment is really chill and laid back, it has this industrial modern feel to it. I love the lighting, lots of light and they have a nice outdoor area with a fireplace to boot! Now the coffee...their chai lattes are freakin awesome and my boyfriend had regular coffee which he enjoyed as well. Moving on to the food, I had the farmers omelet and it was amazingly delicious for a vegetarian omelet. My boyfriend had this breakfast sandwich, can't think of the name off the top of my head, something \"gallo\" but he thought it was amazing and it looked amazing as well. It's a little pricey but the food is well prepared, very healthy and good portions (not too much, not too little). I love how they support local products and they serve microbrews!!   The downside?? THE FLIES! Like someone mentioned below I was doing the hillside wave to swat the flies! My boyfriend and I rolled up the newspaper we were reading to kill a really annoying fly! There were several flies, I don't know if it was because we were sitting by the window, but they were annoying!  Overall I would go back because I love the atmosphere, the food is delicious and healthy, and the coffee is yummy!"}
{"text":"Hillside Spot has been my go-to breakfast place for years. Their pancakes are delicious and Phoenix magazine (I think it was) gave Hillside one of their 'Best Breakfast' places based on different breakfast categories. BUT...a few weeks ago they were cited by county health department for 6 violations. More than any other restaurant in the county for that period. Read the reviews about the flies? And I do remember being bothered by a few flies while dining inside the restaurant. Now I think we know 'why the flies.' So stupid. What a waste."}
{"text":"Want so bad to give this place a good review but I can't because if awful service. I agree about the good beer selection and food, but these people are so desperate to leave early that the waitress had to inform us 3 times that the kitchen closes in 20 mins. This all before saying hello."}
{"text":"What a treat!  I've been meaning to check this place out for sometime now, and I am so glad that I did.  The casual counter service style is nothing new to me, however, I am going to caution anyone that is in the mood for full service that you do not get that here.  Place your order, then grab your drink and set ups and find a cozy seat, and you're all set.  I had the Chilaquiles Verdes and boy-oh-boy was this dish tasty. The fresh ingredients are apparent in the flavors going on, and the green chili sauce was the best I may have ever had.  Tried the coffee cake too, and it was great - just the right amount of cherry flavor.  The only reason that the place didn't get five stars was the rather indifferent service rendered by the gentleman behind the counter.  When you are in a great mood and looking forward to a good meal, a stoic stone faced greeting kind of detracts from this a bit.  (sorry, just my thoughts on the matter).  That being said I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Not sure where to begin but I'll start with the atmosphere. The restaurant has a cool, local pub vibe to it that if you're a regular you can certainly enjoy.  The food (I've only have breakfast there) is average. The turkey omelette I had wasn't bad and the bacon was decent.  The problem is with the ever present flies. It's literally flies, flies and more flies. You'll spend the majority of your time swatting away flies as you try to eat.  The staff seem used to it but as a person trying to eat, it's a real nuisance. The first two times I went I thought maybe the flies just happen to get in, but this is a common occurrence.  When you realize that the same flies that are around dumpsters are the same flies landing on your food, you tend to lose your appetite.  This is a direct reflection of the cleanliness and that's something I can't overlook.  Eat at your own risk...."}
{"text":"Not bad, but did not get order, as ordered. Waitstaff a bit slow too. Great environment though and great tea!"}
{"text":"I've come here for breakfast before and haven't had a problem with food in the past.  I'm not sure what happened tonight, but I will never come here for dinner again.  My two friends and I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, a tuna melt, and a soup.  Keep in mind, I NEVER send back food.  Tonight was the exception.  The soup was cold, so they brought us another one, which was fine. But both sandwiches were cold, and the cheese wasn't even melted.  The server apologized and said they would make us new sandwiches.  A few minutes later they brought out a new sandwich-- except it wasn't new! They were the same sandwiches they brought a few minutes earlier-- with our bite marks in them.  They put partially eaten food back on the grill.  Health code violation, maybe?? The server was very apologetic when we pointed it out, and although our sandwiches didn't taste bad, she said she would bring out new ones.  The tuna melt came out fine, but my grilled cheese with bacon and jalapeño was terrible!! It was mostly raw jalapeño with a little bit of cheese.  I took a few bites and gave up.  This-- coming from a girl who is almost always in the clean plate club!  The only redeeming factors tonight were are apologetic server and the bottle of wine we ordered."}
{"text":"Damn! I wanted to be the first to write about this funky fresh new dining spot. My review is completely on the other end of the spectrum of the last reviewer. I've been to Hillside Spot about half a dozen or more times and have been entertained, well fed, and treated like family.   Hillside has big chestnuts to open a place like this in a town that is used to ITALIAN ITALIAN and more ITALIAN restaurants. The only thing you might find Italian at Hillside is one of the chef's slicked back jet black hair style. I'm not even sure if that's Italian but it looks cool.   The best seat in the house is the mesquite locally made bar. It's has some serious wood. It's placed right in front of the open kitchen. You see everything from the chefs working their flavor magic to their bad ass rotisserie - it's awesome.   Do you want to know about the food? It's good! Their Modern American cuisine has a little flare (nothing that will scare off the Italian junkies), a lot of flavor, and fair prices. The ingredients are fresh and locally purchased.   Hats off to Hillside's staff, especially Christopher and I think she is the FOH manager (she has black hair and always smiling.) They have passion; they are courteous; and genuine. Clap clap clap!    Hillside if you read this - will you consider adding something special to your menu? A handmade seasonal milkshake. Mmmmmmmm. And wifi, please!"}
{"text":"Great place. Once we discovered it we have been going back non-stop! We particularly enjoyed the coffee; not sure what coffee they use but it's absolutely delicious, especially the capuccinos and mocha's. They also serve it in these nice mugs, which just adds to the experience. I highly recommend it! However, the staff tended not to be too experienced in making their coffee so there were often some variations in size of the coffees, milk used, whether or not they added whipped cream etc. I recommend that the cafe managers to capitalize on their delicious coffee by training each waiter to make a consistent coffee and by asking the same questions consistently (does the customer want whole milk, skim milk, etc.?) and by advertising it as one of the cafe's strengths. Again, I haven't had coffee this good in quite a while."}
{"text":"We started going to Hillside about 4 months ago and I have been waiting to write my review so I would have a really balanced opinion.  This place is just so up and down.  It drives me crazy but I think after last night it will be awhile before I go back.  This place is like an abusive relationship (they never treat you right but you love them!).  The food is pretty good.  I really like their pancakes, very rich and fluffy.  The croque is good.  I love the bread.  The pulled pork and carne asade are favorites and I really enjoy the house dressing.  The guacamole has an interesting taste and a fair beer and wine selection.  I also love their coffee.  That being said I have to agree with everyone else.  Their service is subpar and it is shocking because most times I go there are probably only three to four other people in the restaurant with three or four servers talking behind the counter.  They are not really accommodating with the menu.  I dare you to ask for a simple tweak without getting a huge sigh out of one of them.  I can't put my finger on it...maybe the owners or management are mean and that rolls down to the staff but they just seem really unhappy and put out about stuff.  The weekend mornings are hoppin' and it really rattles the poor boys and girls that work there (what?!?! People want breakfast?!?).  Don't get the girl who wears jean shorts and tennis shoes.  Just get up and leave if they put you in her section.  Seriously.  I like the space.  They play good music and the food is not bad but I think it bothers them when customers come in.  Oh and happy hour doesn't apply on Fridays even though their sign says \"Mon. - Fri.\" that was the straw that broke the camels back for me. obviously they don't want people to eat here.  I'll just go to the whole foods cafe instead.  Until I forget again and give them another chance in a few months."}
{"text":"In short: not good.   Got the chilaquiles. They were floating in a pool of the vinegar that separated from the bland salsa piled on top. All the layers were flavorless without a hint of seasoning or spice. The cheese had congealed into a thick, gummy layer of tepid goo.   The wings were equally lacking with rubbery flesh/skin and a thin sauce that was terrible.   A croque madame that was undersized and more bread than anything else.  Combine that with a slow wait staff and a slow kitchen (30 min for a party of 3 with a dead dining room) and you get a massive disappointment."}
{"text":"Wonderful little gem!  Excellent service, Ryan!  You rock!   Good food and wonderful blended coffee and tea drinks.  We can't wait to come back to try more from the refreshingly varied menu.  Breakfast lunch and dinner served all day.  Yes!!"}
{"text":"I was debating whether to go to Hillside Spot or hit up Sprouts and make my own meal. I found the experience to be pretty much in line with reviews, that is - inconsistency is the problem here. On walking in, its a nice open layout concept - the hipsters on yelp tend to call it quaint or cute, while everyone else seems to say hipster. I wasn't really welcomed, but the girl stared at me as I walked up to the host stand and I said \"for one\" and she asked if I wanted bar or table. The server was sort of quick, then the manager took my order. I probably looked obnoxious reading the yelp reviews but lone diner, give me a break. Food was good, not that anyone asked, got one refill (which I requested), sort of wanted dessert but I was left alone despite being at the POS so I just put out my card and left. I think the best thing for this place is to go in with medium expectations and hope to be pleasantly surprised. They definitely think that being local may do better than some 101 on service. My salad - the Thai salad special- wasn't what I was looking for when I walked in, but delicious. Oh and they forgot to put some regulars order next to me. This is the second or third time I've been here, the other times being awhile ago - long wait, inconsistent food (my meal sucked previously), or really good meal? Maybe they hit like 30% success rate."}
{"text":"the toddy was good, the food not so much. it was pricey and there were a few too many flies buzzing around for my liking."}
{"text":"FIVE STARS!  Hillside Spot Cafe never disappoints and always comes through with amazing flavors and service.  These photos contain the FULL Hillside Menu as well as one of their altered menu items!  A breakfast burrito including scrambled eggs, carne asada, avocados, potatoes, cheese, salsa and spicy aioli for taste! Served with a cup of seasonal fruit on the side not pictured."}
{"text":"Followed other yelp reviews to this gem. Had the huevos rancheros with chili verde. It was fresh and delightful. The hash browns were probably the best I've ever had. Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"As some of the other reviewers, I waited until I had given this locally owned place a few chances...2 times for breakfast and once for an early dinner.  I have to say I did enjoy the breakfasts (pancakes once and farmers omelet the second) The food was very good, but the wait and the service were big strikes. I totally understand the wait for breakfast on a Sunday morning...it is a busy place with folks going to the farmers market nearby. First time we waited 20 minutes. The second time we waited almost 30. We had said we would take inside or outside, but for some reason the hostess heard only the 'outside.'  When we went for early dinner, the place was pretty deserted. We ordered a beer (they have Kiltlifter on tap, which is our fav) and then we waited and waited. After 15 minutes the beer came, and before we could say we wanted to order the server dashed away. We waited another 5 minutes or so, he came back and we ordered the cheeseburgers...medium. 20 minutes later they came out...so well done they were practically dry. Big disappointment. The server we had never came back, didn't ask if we wanted another beer, etc. so when we were through we went up to the hostess and asked for our check. So silly when there were only 3 tables seated this whole time and no one on the patio (too hot) One server should be able to deal with 3 tables!!  All three times I went, I felt that the service was below par and the attitude being kinda 'who cares, I'll get around to it when I can.' And no one smiles at this place.  Darn, I really wanted this to be a local hang-out place for us."}
{"text":"Ahwatukee is known for having a lot of chain restaurants. Luckily, this isn't one of them which is all the more reason to hit up his spot. They have a great indoor space with a market as well as a nice outdoor patio. The staff has always been overly helpful, nice and prompt. I have been to this place twice and ordered the same exact thing because it is THAT good. It's a very laid back place and I love the versatility of it. Great for studying, meeting up with a business client, hanging with a friend or even for a larger social crowd. The food is excellent!! Check them out if you are in this area."}
{"text":"Great food!! Service is sucky. Overall a nice spot. Would have given five stars if our server had ever bothered to check on us or get more drinks. Too bad..."}
{"text":"This place is my local. The coffee is great, and the outdoor patio (covered with an awning) is awesome. The food is pretty good, and the menu could do with some updating on a regular basis, but I'm nitpicking.   Take it for what it is - a cafe, not a gourmet dining experience. Everything is made from scratch, nothing is frozen. Yes the service can be a little inconsistent, but they try and they have a great attitude."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Their food is high quality, healthy, delicious and they have a huge variety of choices. I love that they do breakfast all day.  Their staff have always been friendly and kind.  If you enjoy and appreciate beer you can just ask and nearly everyone that works there knows a whole lot about what is on tap, what they stock consistently in their coolers and even about the wines they provide.  Everyone I have brought here as a guest for the first time falls in love with it.  I highly recommend this place for all three meals of the day."}
{"text":"Well, it looks like word really got around about the Hillside Spot! The first few times I was here, I couldn't tell if they were open or not until I opened the door. The last few times I was here, I could barely get a seat.   That being said, it's so wonderful to have another locally-owned establishment in the neighborhood. Over the past few months, they've added a nice patio, though hopefully they'll find some umbrellas or it won't be any good in a few weeks! In addition to the restaurant, there's a small market area of candy/gourmet foods/cookware and some books/toys. The kitchen is wide open and it's interesting to watch the hustle and bustle while waiting in line.  I've only been here for breakfast and coffee so far. If it's busy, i've decided my plan is to pick up a coffee and a Cheddar Bacon scone.. wow, my mouth waters just thinking about these. They are just the right ratio of cheddar and bacon while still being buttery and crumbly.   The two egg breakfast is good but not outstanding. I felt like some potatoes or fruit would really add to the meal. On my most recent visit I had the Croque Monsieur, a combination of ham, gruyere, and bechamel over toast, with an egg on top. My meal came with a tiny serving of strawberries and blueberries. The quantity was just right and the taste delicious, although I think the bread was a little over-toasted. (I had trouble cutting into it with the knife provided.)   I plan on coming back for lunch or maybe dinner soon, and hopefully it won't be as busy. I'm happy to see they are doing well given how the economy has changed, but I don't enjoy fighting crowds for a meal. Fortunately, the delicious food and use of local ingredients well outweighs that issue."}
{"text":"I love small business... so I'm always disappointed when I can't give a rave review. We went to Hillside Spot after a race (running) so we were starved. I went to the counter and ordered an OJ and pancakes. They took our order quickly and gave us a number for the table. It took about 15 minutes, but they brought us the plates of food... but no drinks. The employee said \"it's by the register.\" So, I went back inside, grabbed an OJ out of the cooler (wish the person taking our order would have mentioned that) and went back outside. As I sat down to eat my pancakes (again, I was starving), I noticed that there was no silverware. So, I went back inside and noticed it was on a separate table behind the cash registers.... again, I wish they would have mentioned that it wouldn't come out with the food. THEN, there was no syrup with the pancakes. So, I went back inside AGAIN and had to wait for someone to pour me syrup into a cup and they even got the syrup all over the outside of the cup, which I had to carry back outside. Finally, I was able to sit down and eat. The pancakes were good, but nothing to get super excited about. They definitely filled the void- just glad they weren't cold after I had to run back inside 3 times to get everything I needed.   Not impressed with the employees- they didn't do a single thing to go out of their way to make this an exceptional experience. If they would have told me about the OJ at the register and checked if we needed anything else when dropping off the food, I surely would have given this a better review. Hopefully they'll do better for future guests."}
{"text":"I was disappointed!  Service was slow for this dinner visit.  Ordered a steak cooked medium well.  It came out medium rare.  Steak came with two sides.  I ordered corn on the cob and mac and cheese.  The waitress later informed me they were out of mac and cheese.  She suggested french fries which I got.  They were overly salted.  When reviewing the bill I was charged $1.50 for each side order.  The waitress removed these charges at my request since the sides are included in the price of the steak.  The patio is nice and I might consider trying breakfast here but wont be back for dinner."}
{"text":"I love breakfast so I was happy to hear about this place. Last Sunday the boyfriend and I ventured over there after a hike at South Mountain.  The place is popular. Even though it was afternoon it was still busy. And even though it was lunchtime they were still serving breakfast - yay!  I ordered the pancakes with apple compote and bacon and boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger and fries.  The pancakes were huge. Two plate sizes cakes with cinnamon-y apples on top. The bacon was 4 strips and although they were thin they were good. The pancakes had a nice fluffy texture and a good flavor. The apples were just okay. They didn't detract from the cakes they just didn't really add anything either. I might go with the strawberries next time.   Boyfriend said his burger was good, not amazing but tasty. He said it was a little bland. But the fries were really good.  The atmosphere is a relaxed sophistication. It's a big airy space and the have lots of outdoor seating as well.   I will find my way back to Hillside Spot again I'm sure."}
{"text":"I've been to Hillside Spot several times and it is always fantastic.  It has great food and a cool vibe."}
{"text":"I have only been to Hillside Spot for dinner, so my review is just for that, and I fully recommend it. Three stars is a good rating, and that's what Hillside Spot is, consistently good.    The interior design reminds me of Liberty Market, which is a good thing, I find it inviting and friendly, it feels comfortable, though there is nothing particularly special about it.    As for the food, like the interior, it kind of reminds me of Liberty Market, which again is good. The gallo guacamole is made to order and has a nice sweetness to it and I like it topped with the cotija cheese, the croque monsieur is like a guilty pleasure, it is a rich and very tasty sandwich with beschamel sauce and a fried egg on top. My favorite dish however is the baked chicken cacciatore. Please order it. I don't even want to write about it, I'll get all flustered. Hillside also has a good beer selection.    I used \"good\" a lot in this review because that's the best way to explain it. I certainly think everyone should try it out, I think you'll like it, but don't expect anything grand, go expecting a good meal, and know you're supporting a local business, always a terrific thing to do."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review having just left the Hillside Spot. We waited well over the 40 minutes they said it would take to be seated and when they said we were up next they still sat other groups before us. The first thing my husband said when we were walking to our table, was \"this place looks dirty\".  (We should have left then) There were crumbs on the ground, the restrooms were dirty and at one point, one of the waitresses dropped a knife, kicked it out if the way but NEVER bothered to pick it up.  When we finally ordered it took another 20 minutes to get our appetizers then 20 more to get our meals. While we waited for our food, we saw the girl at the table next to us get a cup of coffee with complimentary lipstick stains on the rim.  That's just gross!  The food was simply not worth the wait.  Small portions left the family disappointed and hungry for more... but not from there.  We will not be returning any time soon.   Save yourself the time & disappointment. ... go somewhere else. They only got a two because the waitress was helpful and very apologetic for the delay...we know it's not her fault that the kitchen is slow."}
{"text":"Nice discovery in Ahwatukee. Been there a few times for breakfast and lunch. First the good stuff. The place has ample indoor and outdoor seating. The counter staff is nice and able to give nice suggestions. The food meets expectations but isn't special. Don't go here for a business meeting. No matter the time of day, the music is loud, too loud really to have a normal conversation. When getting my cup for coffee I had to ask for a clean cup, mine was covered in lip stick. We also had to move outside after being bothered by a handful of pesky flies buzzing about in the restaurant. Not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Major letdown! I guess I should have listened to the Yelp reviews, but instead I listened to two word-of-mouth referrals. Came in around 8:00am on a Saturday morning and the restaurant was relatively quiet. My husband and I were seated within a few minutes so that was a plus. We ordered two iced white mochas to drink... big mistake! It look nearly 25 minutes to get our coffees.... they were actually delivered at the same time as our food! Besides the coffee being delivered ridiculously late, it tasted terrible! There was definitely nothing white or mocha about it and it had a horrible bitter after taste. Drank a few sips and left the rest. Now for the food... another disappointment! We were told that Hillside Spot was the place to go in Ahwatukee for chilaquiles... wow were we misinformed. Their version of chilaquiles is two corn tostadas with meat in the middle, bland, watery, green \"salsa\" pored over the top, and two eggs on the side..... Umm.... That is in no way chilaquiles. We also tried their house pancakes... yet again another letdown. Absolutely nothing special about them and they left a strange bitter aftertaste in your mouth as if too much baking powder was used. Syrup had no flavor and tasted watered down. Over all not impressed with this place which is a major shame because my husband and I like to support local small businesses. They only thing that earned them two stars was their vast selection of beers. They do have a very impressive beer list, however, I do not think we will be returning. What a shame."}
{"text":"Great food! I have never been disappointed here. You cant go wrong with the chicken, it is always perfect! The other reviews about poor service were right a few month ago, the service has greatly improved. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I am a really big fan of their food. You can tell they make their food with love and quality ingredients. Get the pancakes!!"}
{"text":"The service was very laid back...a bit slow...but it's a great spot and I wasn't disappointed in my mimosas or my omelette. Really nice atmosphere inside and the patio looked lovely."}
{"text":"My wife likes this place and that's why I've been several times. Since I can't complain to her I'll complain to you! Each time I come here I hope maybe this is the time the food wows me. Spoiler: it doesn't. Every meal I've had here is wildly mediocre. The desserts are good.  I was really quite upset on my last attempt though.  Usually I order breakfast/brunch items but seeing as I've had no luck with those I opted for a simple sandwich. Something basic so I would at least not have a bad lunch. I went for the tuna melt figuring even if they opened a can of tuna, mixed in a scoop of mayo, put it on toast, melted some cheese and charged me $9 it'd still be good. Oh, how I wish they just did that. It was, quite honestly, disgusting. The tuna, what I could taste, seemed to be chunk light and had a cornucopia of items mixed in. This included fruit. Fruit in my tuna salad. There were so many things mixed in I could barely taste the tuna OR cheese. The bread it was on was good. I should've just ordered toast. Additionally, while the fries are made in house they are not good either. Clearly they're not blanched because they're soggy and had no seasoning. Lastly, as you've read in many of these other reviews the service is pretty shoddy.   It is a cute restaurant with all the signs that it'll be good but be warned; looks can be deceiving."}
{"text":"Note to wait staff and hostess: seating people and waiting on them is your job, not a favor that you are grudgingly performing.  Smiling costs nothing and mqkes a good impression. Please don't reach across someone's plate, right in front of their face to hand something to another diner, that is just really rude. Let people taste the meal before you ask them if it is ok. When serving wine, don't just plonk it on the table and walk away.  Make sure it is the right bottle, open it and let someone taste it before leaving.  If you have cleared away the plates and cutlery, bring forks when serving dessert.  The wait staff has apperently never gotten any training. They seem nice, just clueless.  The food was nice, but not nice enough to overcome having to walk over to the wait staff to ask for what we  needed. Yes we got a bottle of wine, but not the one  we had ordered. We had to go and ask for the beer. We had to go and ask for lemon for the salmon... it's a lot of work to patronize this resurant, and if I wanted to work this hard, I'd just cook a meal at home.  This was the second try. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Parking lot is somewhat challenging.  Spots are big enough to easily accomodate smaller vehicles, and now that ACE Hardware is gone it looks like there will be more spaces available.  Free reign to park bad.   There's one bistro set just to the East of the entrance where you can dine with your dog.  They have a patio here, but do not allow dogs on their patio.   Can someone explain the reason for this when Uncle Bears, just up the road will allow dogs on their patio. Alright, nevermind.  Okay, let's just go inside.  Trendy atmosphere.  Its casual, low key and set up nicely.  I like their industrial displays of drinks and other edibles.  Rustic boxes and metal crates accented with galvanized buckets filled with schtuff bring the comfort of memorbilia that doesn't overwhelm to the point of tacky. Clientele this early morning was primarily business meetings which soon turned over to neighborhood folks with kids, etc. as it got closer to 9 a.m. My oatmeal is average.  Just a tad soupy for me.  But it comes with brown sugar and raisins, and server brought cream at my request.  And no additional charge.  TYVM. My side of ham wasnt much more than what appeared to be a couple slices of deli ham.   My company had the pancakes with Apple compote.  The portion was equivalent to maybe a quarter of an Apple and looked more like sauteed than a compote. Taste of pancakes ranked as pretty good. Now the water. That's Phoenix city water - unfiltered, nastiness.  Strangely enough the server tells me they have a filter on one of the other water sources but what they give customers is not filtered. Now that's a way to encourage someone to order something other than water. Overall, fair seating area (but the chairs are small/short), food good, service good, water horrible."}
{"text":"If you're in Ahwatukee and you're hungry . The place to go is hillside spot great food great atmosphere great spot to take the family. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is easily the best breakfast place in Ahwatukee, probably in the East Valley.  It gives high quality, organic places like Joe's Farm Grill and Liberty Market a serious run for their money.  The first time we tried Hillside Spot, they had just been featured in the AZ Republic.  When we arrived, they were turning people away - they couldn't handle the volume.  Each additional time that I have been for breakfast (always on a Sat or Sun) it has been crowded, but not mobbed.  We usually wait about 5 minutes for a table.  The food is amazing.  Large portions of good, high quality food.  I love the Croque Monsieur - a thick slab of frilled french bread slathered with bechamel sauce and topped with thin-sliced grilled ham, melted Gruyere cheese, and an egg (the egg is optional, and is added at no charge).  My wife had the huevos rancheros.  The salsa verde was fantastic and the potatoes were great, but I found that dish to be a little boring.  The pancakes look fantastic and the coffee is really, really good.  They use an open kitchen design so that you can see the food prep, and every single dish looks incredible.  I have not been here for lunch, but the burgers look excellent.  I am in love with this place, but am going to give it a 4 just because its still rather chaotic in here.  I was confused about how to get my drinks, the waitresses run around yelling out your name as they deliver the food that you ordered from the register, and it is often just a bit overwhelming.  On the other hand, this is only because the place is so good, and people are starting to figure it out.  I am SO glad that a place like this exists in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Early breakfast-right when opened-the Croque Monsieur-good sourdough bread w/ham slice and sunnyside egg/great. The fresh squeezed OJ, with Rebecca's Early Bird Granola/loaded w/fresh fruit pieces, nuts, and cinnamon granola, finishes out a great meal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. From the chill urban vibe to the delicious food, it always hits the spot. Everything is fresh and the coffee is spot on. Blake is the best server, make sure to ask for him the next time you go in! My favorite brunch place."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Friendly staff, great coffee, and the best pancakes in town!  The Hit-the-Spot pancakes are a must try!  Fun place for evening coffee and dessert too.  Try later in the evening, and you might get free dessert as they clean out the case for the next day!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot. Had the chilaquiles verde and the lady had pancakes, and ordered a side of hasbrowns for an extra dollar! Chilaquiles were incredibly flavorful. She said the pancakes were tasty, covered in a drizzle, bananas, and candied peanuts. She also said the pancakes without the toppings would have been pretty plain. The service was fast and friendly however no check back on the food until we finished. Would have been a 5 star however the hashbrowns were incredibly, almost inedibldy salty as well as our eggs were both overcooked and brown on the bottom (I ordered over easy she had over medium).   On a different note they have a marketplace to by the beers that they serve in house and a build your own six pack option which is pretty neat."}
{"text":"Great spot! Much bigger than I expected. The Hillside Reuben was great. Would definitely come back and try again. Only four stars because we had to wait a while after we were done eating for our check and never got drink refills."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch - but was stoked to find out that they offer breakfast till 4pm! The rest of my party got sandwiches and burgers but I got the Farmer omelet. It was egg whites only, with spinach, mushrooms, red bell peppers, and zuchinni. It was AWESOME!   I also got their latte so I could gauge the quality of their coffee. It was really good too! Kudos, they also have soy!   I can't wait to go here again, so take the following with a grain of salt. The downers? Well, there are SO many flies inside! I think they can open up their windows when it's nice out in the mornings, so that's probably where they all come from, but it's kind of obnoxious. Also, sometimes their service can be a little disconnected, however today I had two really good interactions with the staff.   Next time I'm going to try some of their salads or more breakfast items.   A suggestion to the management? Turkey burgers! The beef burger looks SO good, but some of us don't eat beef. Looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Good food, laid back, good beer choices... great place if you're looking for a sit back place to enjoy time with friends or family and want good food but don't need stellar foodie meal. The mix match 6 - pack of beer is good deal if you want something to go and keeps you from making that extra trip to liquor store. Only negative we've had here is the service can be slow. It seems they assign tables in rotation order instead of zones so wait staff is all over the place and can't attend to tables as quickly."}
{"text":"One of the best in Ahwatukee. Serving great food and adult beverages. Live music sometimes. Over all good. Service could be better. Dog friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food but the service here is absolutely horrible. I have been here multiple times and I get no drink refills, my food arrives cold, and I can even find the waiters to even get what I need. I'm very frustrated that such a great Good literally has the worst service in town. Please retrain your people to be responsive!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I feel like I am in a piece of SF or Portland, but better since it's in Ahwatukee! Super convenient after a South Mountain hike and the food and drinks are amazing! Their beer selection is good and supports local beer and their fries are hand cut. I have eaten there for brunch and lunch. I would give this five stars if the service was better. It can be spotty and very inconsistent. I would also probably vist more often if the service was good...but the food is pretty fab."}
{"text":"First time visit and I'm a fan. The patio is great with a nice fire for the cooler nights. The menu is expansive (and a little overwhelming) with a variety of apps, noshes, and main course items. We tried the chicken quesedilla and it was really good.  The beer and wine menu is impressive- you can select from a really impressive variety of beers both bottled and tapped. Most of the options are micro-brews from all over the country and even a good few from AZ. Happy hour prices are great and my wife felt like the wine selection was really good, both white and red. Our server was friendly and didn't hang over us while we decided what to order. He kept up with us as we ate our food and sipped our drinks- offering suggestions along the way. We will be back to Hillside for dinner sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Back here after a four year absence. Hillside Spot never missed a beat.  My wife ordered the huevos rancheros. I ordered the El Jefe omelette and subbed out chorizo for Bacon.  Since everyday can be a cheat day, I ordered a banana/Nutella crescent and split it with the rest of our party. It was absolutely delicious.  A slam dunk. I was told the huevos rancheros was as delicious as before. The El Jefe omelette was ok. I have had a lot of omelettes and this one was a little flat, full of ingredients, but a little crispy.  The added jalapeños gave it the right amount of heat and the subbed in bacon gave it a healthy crunch.    On a side note, our server Christen was very attentive but a little snooty."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place while looking for a quick meal and a nice place to study and read. After a short wait, for which they were very apologetic, we were seated on the patio. Although crowded, the noise level was pleasant and it was bright and airy. I ordered the half sandwich half salad, which was tasty but not super filling. Maybe I would have had a different experience of I'd ordered meat. My partner ordered the daily special which was a brisket sandwich and a side of coleslaw. He said it was good and seemed satisfied. The place cleared out a bit while we ate, so we stayed to read, study and use the decent Wi-Fi. All in all it was a pleasant experience, and I'd definitely return, especially for the patio seating."}
{"text":"I love this place, great people, great food and it's always my first go to local spot to head too when I have friends visiting from out of town. You are all killing it!"}
{"text":"Best food. Worst service every single time. Does it stop me from coming?? No... Please Hillside!!! PLEASE retrain your staff. There was nobody in there and we waited for 35 minutes for anyone to ask us if we wanted anything to drink.  So sad"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I brought my family here from out of town and was highly disappointed. Our waitress was out of sight literally the entire time, the food was cold, people behind us got theirs before and had barely sat down. When I informed our waitress of the situation and dissatisfaction she seemed bothered and failed to empathize. When brought the new food out it was always other workers and still cold, hash browns are the worst. Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Really great spot to eat, breakfast served all day. They have a great menu and an outside particular with a little for place. The staff was really laid back and timely. Would visit again."}
{"text":"Hillside Spot is one of my favorite haunts in Ahwatukee.  Very chill and relaxing atmosphere, I love to sit on the back patio around the fire during the cooler months.   Timeliness of service has never been a problem.   The Norteño Burger is certainly a favorite.  You'll find a blend of ground beef, chorizo and green chile sure to set your world on fire.   Get it with the fries and their famous aioli dipping sauce, the stir-fry vegetables if you're watching your waistline.  So many beers and wines to choose from, you're sure to find something you'll enjoy.  Also it should be noted, breakfast is served all day - So if you're a crackhead like me and want that delicious egg, chorizo and potato burrito at 7PM - Do your thang, homes."}
{"text":"5/27/10  After reading a couple of reviews on Hillside Spot, I decided to check it out myself.  Besides noticing that the line was still long, despite it being around 1030-1045 on a Thursday morning, I also noticed that this place gets NOISY!  I didn't care if it was full-on sun outdoors and already hot, I could not, and would not, bear the noise indoors :(, and apparently a few customers had the same idea, bec. the only available tables out there were lacking umbrellas.  [I'd give 4 or more stars if it wasn't so loud!!]  Don't fret, though, as I found one of the staff was willing to set up a table w/ an umbrella- all you have to do is ask!  I already checked the menu online for ideas, so I already knew what I might want to try.  Bec. of the crowd and the noise that greeted me on this first visit, which jarred me and had me scrambling for some space, I wasn't able to check out the display cases and counterspace w/ their array of pastries- cupcakes, apple pie by-the-slice, cookies, tarts, muffins, and scones, which vary daily.  Do check them out!  (The apple pie is so so good!)  The daily special sounded good, but I decided I'd try the Croque Madame (a Croque monsieur topped w/ a fried egg) and the Pancakes w/ Apple Compote.  Ordering is at the counter where you pay and take a card to mark your table w/.  It takes awhile for your food to be prepared, so keep this in mind when you do decide to visit.  I'd say this would be a good time to check out the pastries, but depending on how busy HS gets, you may want to place all of your order selections in the beginning and get it over w/.  The croque madame is simply outstanding!  Well, except for the burnt bits.  The French bread (from MJ Bread, I believe) was just perfect, topped w/ a fantastic bechamel sauce, sliced ham, melty gruyere cheese, and a fried egg!  This is definitely an item I would order again and again!  The pancakes were good (loved the batter mix!), but \"apple compote,\" this wasn't!  OK, I admit, the compotes I've had thus far were fruit reductions that were thick and sweetened from the natural juices, as well as added sugar, so perhaps Hillside Spot's \"apple compote\" technically qualifies as a compote (as defined by dictionary.com- \"fruit stewed or cooked in a syrup\"), but I found the topping as neither sweet nor stewed enough (the chopped apples still had a lot of crunch in them!).  Thankfully, I had my bottle of pure maple syrup in my purse to sweeten the pancakes!  :)  7/24/10 I visited HS for a second time in early June and tried the berry pancakes w/ homemade whipped cream.  These were delightful!  I almost ate the whole thing, and had I not tried the apple pie, I definitely would've polished them off.  The added bananas (perfectly ripened) took this dish over-the-top!"}
{"text":"Service: Coffee was cold on delivery from server. Asked for new cup, coffee was cold on 2nd cup. Waiter seem to just not care, I'll live without coffee, no big deal. Asked to have it off the bill, not done.  Never drink it, waiter never asked how was breakfast, was the coffee nice and cold, is it raining, do I care?   Called next day, asked to speak to manager, let them know I just thought they shouldn't charge for cold coffee, response was \" is this really that important? \". I asked then to speak to a manager which is the point of this review and left my name and phone number and received no phone call back."}
{"text":"Just went there for breakfast. It was a complete disaster.   We waited in line for 5 minutes for the hostess to take our name and then waited 15 minutes after that to be seated. This was a little frustrating since we could see there were open tables.   Once we were sat on the patio, the waitress took our drink order and didn't come back to take our food order for about 15 minutes. She seemed annoyed and indifferent.  We waited FOREVER for our food. People around us were clearly as displeased as we were. The waitress never came over to refill our drinks or offer any explanation for the wait. It was almost as if she was avoiding us. We just sat and waited, getting more annoyed every minute. We watched as tables of customers sat with no food and the staff milled around, no pep in their step, no sense of urgency. They all seemed like they really could not care less about their jobs and their tips.   When we finally got our food it was nothing impressive. We basically got an $8 slice of bread with some ham and cheese on it. Nothing anyone couldn't make at home. Never got a refill on our drinks. Food was edible but I wouldn't call it \"good\".   The waitress explained, after I asked why it took so long that 3 people in the kitchen had walked out so that's why she was frustrated. SHE WAS FRUSTRATED? I couldn't believe she had the nerve to say that when she wasn't doing anything to make up for it. I would respect them if they looked like they were trying but they really weren't.   There was no sign of a manager or owner. It looked like a bunch of sloppy, apathetic kids with no guidance working there. If your kitchen staff walked out that's a clear indication of a problem.   It's too bad because the ambiance is cute and hip, and this area could really use a privately owned spot for breakfast, but all in all, I would say DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY on this poorly managed joint. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I had the chopped salad for lunch today.  It was delicious!  The service was very good, too."}
{"text":"I love the location.  The place has so much potential the food is not great.  I love the items they serve but the taste is off,  the omelette are dry and over cooked, if you order a English muffin you get 1/2 and it's not even toasted.  It's sad because we are so limited in ahwatukee on decent places to eat.  The concept is great and they stay in business not because it's good food and good service it's more because we don't have any options.  The place is dirty as well.  I wish the owner would go drive out to liberty market (Gilbet)and see what they are doing out there and bring it here. It's worth driving to Gilbert over coming to hillside."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food because we didn't get that far.  The place had a less than pristine feel when we walked in, but we were willing to overlook that.  It was when we watched the hostess toss her hair around (literally bending over at the waist to flip it forward then all the way back) and proceed to put her hair up in a ponytail, take it out and then repeat the process, that we decided we didn't have the stomach to eat there."}
{"text":"We were heading to Chandler, and decided to stop here for a late lunch.  Hubby had read about it, and thought it would be perfect for us.  It wasn't really busy, since we arrived around 3:30ish on a Friday afternoon.  We got a nice table, and had a very friendly waitress come right over to us.  We wanted some guacamole and chips to start off, but I don't like jalapenos (which are in the guac), and she said they make it fresh, so they can leave those out.  As soon as I heard that, I knew I was going to enjoy this meal.  Hubby decided to also get himself a bowl of clam chowder (which he has to try wherever we go).  The guac was incredibly creamy and delicious, and the chips tasted freshly made, as well.  Hubby's chowder was gigantic!  He truly didn't expect that much, but he loved it, and finished every last drop.  For our main courses, hubby got the fish & chips and I ordered the tuna melt.  I realized what a picky eater I was, when I mentioned that I didn't like the outside of the bread to be buttered (I hate the greasiness when it's made that way).  Our waitress told me they don't use butter on the bread, it's put in the press without it.  Awesome!!!    Hubby's fish & chips were really tasty and crunchy.  He loved the batter, and it came with a chipotle dip instead of tartar sauce, which he also seemed to really like.  The fries were handcut and quite tasty...not overly salted.  My tuna melt was served on \"lavain\" bread (I think that's what it was...sort of a mix between sourdough and seedless rye), which had a really nice flavor.  The tuna was quite good and had a few golden raisins in it.  They added a nice burst of sweetness every now and then.  Everything was delicious, and the wait staff was quite friendly.  We both enjoyed our meal, and would definitely come back whenever we're in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!!!!! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.. food rocks, everything is fresh! Diverse menu. Staff rocks! It's a very positive atmosphere all around!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Hillside Spot! They have delicious food and it's a great environment. I tend to get the tuna salad sandwich every time, but why mess with something so good? I defiantly recommend it or their salads! It's a great place to eat at!!"}
{"text":"I don't live (and I'm never in) this area, but I happened to be at the high school down the street from this place with my running group and we stopped in after our run. I thought it was pretty tasty.   It was (kind of) later on a Tuesday night so it wasn't very crowded. I liked the lay-out though. We sat inside but the patio looked nice. Lots of wood furniture and a semi-open kitchen. I didn't feel like a drink (shocker!) but they have a pretty extensive beer selection. In fact, I believe they have THREE gluten-free options (I'm not gluten-free, but a friend I often go to HH is, and I know gf beer options are often scarce).  The menu is kind of random, but I like it. They serve breakfast all day. Lots of tortas & egg options, but they pancakes and the like as well. They also have lots of salads, sandwiches & burgers. In addition, there's lots of Mexican (really I would say more like \"New Mexican\") meals as well. A lot of the breakfast menu has a \"New Mexican\" spin to it.   I had a veggie burrito that came with rice & beans. It was all very good. I liked it mainly because it was a good balance of being a hearty meal, that wasn't too heavy, but wasn't hoity toity either. This is how a lot of the food here seems to be. The kind of stuff that \"seems\" healthy (and some food can be), but really isn't (and that isn't a bad thing, I think). The veggies in the burrito were grilled nicely, and and had a lot of flavor. I also liked the fried rice it came with. Again, it wasn't too heavy, but still had flavor.   The prices here are reasonable for what you get. The service was so-so. Our waitress was friendly, but wasn't the most attentive.   Like I said, this isn't a part of town I ever come to, but I'd come back here if I ever find myself in this 'hood again."}
{"text":"Hillside, you urban hipster you, what are you doing in all-white- tookee with its' 5 series BMWs and Eddie Bauer car seats..you my friend are raking in the in crowd.   I hit up Hillside on a Sunday and had a brunch lunch moment. I had the croque monsieur and it was meh. The sauce had very little taste and was indistiguishable from the cheese. My husband had an outstanding Reuben, the pastrami was delish and the bread for both of us was great. We had iced tea - standard..  The wait staff was rather unremarkable. The open kitchen is relatively interesting..nothing too complicated happens so its' a little like watching Subway but hey its' urban hipsters making your sandwich."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Try to sit on the patio by the fireplace!  Breakfast and lunch are good.  The salad selection is very good as well.  I love the guacamole and Chips as an appetizer and the Pollo taco plate is delicious!  The happy hour is amazing as well!! Breakfast is quite busy... Just a heads up!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars*** Hillside spot is our first time coming here and mostly the photos from Yelp persuaded our decision to come here for our Sunday morning breakfast.  I am so conflicted on how to review this restaurant because they ended up correcting all the wrongs however, it was a horrible first impression. We checked in and agreed to the 25 minute wait. Mistake number 1. We sat down and looked for a drink menu or Sunday Bloody Mary special couldn't find one. We asked the server for a cocktail list and it was beer/wine only. However, I later in the breakfast saw servers walk around with a watermelon mimosa I didn't see on the list or let be known to me. Mistake number 2. We ordered children's pancakes, hievos ranchos, a breakfast torta and an egg sandwich for later in the day when I feel like nibbling. Only received 2 out of 3 meals. Mistake number 3. Yes, our server comped the children's pancakes but  the pancakes weren't the issue.  We were impressed by other reviews but we most likely won't return for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We were looking for a burger, patio type place that served beer and for the most part we would feel welcome with our toddler. This  place was awesome. It looks like this place may be hit or miss, but it was an absolute hit with us.  We were promptly seated, offered a kids menu  and drinks and the waitress checked in on us as soon as we sat down. We thought the service was great. My husband had a flavorful and juicy burger that we both raved about and my rice bowl (I know-weird selection) was delicious and fresh. We were very impressed and can't wait to try brunch.  I'm a huge yelp reader, but I never write reviews and after our experience tonight I was compelled to say that I sure hope this place  keeps it up because our experience was  just what we hoped for on Friday night!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed every bite but it wasn't exceptional. The smell when you walk in is far more engaging then the staff. Waited a little too long for some coffee and juice. Overall a nice spot."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place for any meal of the day, whether it be breakfast, lunch, or dinner. There's always something on the menu that I can find enjoyable. I love the fact that you can get breakfast all day and their Cocina 55 menu after 4pm is excellent! The restaurant is a little small and we don't care much for their chairs, but if you're in the area and looking for something to eat, this is the place! They have tons of local beers on tap that you can choose from and you have to try their homemade chips, they're the bomb!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for along time and I really loved it until Saturday.  My boyfriend and I went in about 130pm.  I had my service dog with me.   I went up to the hostess stand and waited.  The hostess was standing right in front of me ignoring me.  About 5 minutes later the manager comes over and tells me that I have to sit outside, it was raining at the time.  I replied this is my service dog so i would like to be sat inside.  He told me to go sit down because I would have to wait for an open table, even though there was plenty of tables.  We proceeded to wait 20 minutes until they called my name.  They walked us all the way back to the corner to seat us.   The hostess handed us our menu and walked away.  My dog had gone under the table and was asleep, where she was suppose to be.  Our waiter walked over and proceeded to tell me that I had to produce a service certificate for my dog.  I told him that I am not required by federal law to give him one. He then decided that he was going to yell at me in the middle of the restaurant telling me that the health department requires him to get a certificate (which is a lie, I talked to the health department) and that he is being nice allowing me to stay and eat.  He then yells \"I bet its because you cant give me one thanks for helping out you community\" and storms off.  The manager, if you can even call him that, was standing by the counter staring at this whole thing and does nothing.   I have never been treated with such disrespect in a restaurant.  The owner of this place should be ashamed for having such rude and condescending people working for him.  People who have disabilities shouldnt have to be verbally harassed when they want to get a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Delicious Breakfast, highly recommend the Breakfast Torta it's got Eggs, chorizo, avocado, tomato and eggs, very filling! also their coffee here is made perfect!"}
{"text":"I had the Diablo breakfast burrito. It would have been good, if only they used more of the Diablo sauce. My wife had the Omellete El Jefe which I envied. Omellete el jefe. They have a great beer selection, the service was very attentive, and all in all I'd visit again while traveling through Phoenix.  I loved the little market with the \"make your own 6 pack.\" We tried a lot of the local beers."}
{"text":"Just had takeout from here. Amazing as always!!! Had the carne asada torta. DDelish!!!!"}
{"text":"We are regulars here and love it! Food is great and service is good! We've also gone at night for drinks and the bar is awesome.  Good brews on tap and a wide selection of wines. If you show up sat or Sunday around typical lunch times prepare for a wait!   This is honestly a hidden gem!   Also for previous reviews where they've rated the service low, this has changed. New management took over about 6 months to a year ago and they're way more on top of their waiters. Much improvement!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to breakfast here. What a disappointment.  The food is the only thing that rates any stars at all. Good ingredients cannot be completely ruined by incompetent service.  The space is nice, but crowded and loud. The counter staff were indifferent. After being waved over to an open register, the fellow behind the counter took one order, then wandered off, leaving the rest of us to get back in line at the other register to order.  You are given a number (or not) and left to find your own table, scrounge up your own silverware, and wait for your food to be delivered. Except that the napkins are at a completely different station than the silver, they were out of forks, and most of the tables were completely filthy. I watched a busboy randomly swipe the top of a table, sweeping crumbs onto the benches and chairs, then leave an empty drink bottle on the table before wandering listlessly off.  Beverages are (apparently) serve yourself, although they didn't bother to say that when I ordered. I stood at the counter, waiting for iced tea, only to turn around and see that I was expected to get it myself.  If they happen to \"run out of numbers\", then they input your name with your order. Nothing irritates me more than to have my name shouted across a restaurant. Better yet, the waiters wander from table to table looking for their customers.... \"Lisa? Is there a Lisa here?\" while your food cools. Inexcusable.  The only bright point: the croque madame was tasty. Delicious bread, ham, and a perfectly fried egg. But the meager smear of bechamel and a thin slice of cheese were underwhelming. However, the \"side of fruit\" made me angry: a tiny metal creamer with 1 blackberry, a few slices of strawberry, and 2 chunks of  green apple. Insulting.  Fast casual, order at the counter works well when tables are clean and set, and the food delivery is speedy and efficient. Unfortunately this place needs some work in order to make it worth your time."}
{"text":"Food was great, our server Stephan (I think that was his name based on the receipt, forgot if he mentioned it in the beginning) was attentive and nice, and gave good suggestions. I'd been here a few times for breakfast but never lunch, but was very pleased with the food."}
{"text":"Food was delish, server was awesome. This is a great spot to go to when u want to enjoy a nice breakfast. I like sitting at the outside patio"}
{"text":"Flies!!!!  Good God!  Will somebody do something about all the flies?!?  Inside, outside, doesn't matter. They are everywhere and your constantly swatting them away. Put in some fans to keep them off the customers and away from the doors."}
{"text":"2 reasons to come here: croque madame & Cartel coffee. Besides that...no reason. My husband and I have been here three times. Once, we were sat and then completely forgotten about for over 40 minutes so we left (no one even brought us water). Second time, they crossed our names out instead of another waiting couple so we waited for over an hour to be seated and were offered no apologies. Once we were seated, we were forgotten about again and ended up just leaving. Our third and final time, we finally were sat and able to order in a timely manor, but then no one ever came to refill our drinks or check if we needed anything. Such a bummer."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed by this place. I had a 9 oz mushroom Swiss burger with Mac & cheese as my side. The Mac & cheese was soupy and nothing special. Seemed like cafeteria quality. The burger patty was nice and thick but really had no flavor, it truly didn't taste like anything. For a $15 burger, I expected much better"}
{"text":"Went to breakfast with a friend.  Got the huevos rancheros, sweet crepes, and croque Madame.  Very good quality overall, only downfall would be slow service however the server was friendly and professional. Will definitely keep this place in mind for breakfasts to come (:"}
{"text":"Nasty attitude and non caring. We called twice to see if dogs are allowed . Upon our party of 6 arriving and telling hostess we have a small dog . We waited 30 minutes . When our table was ready we were told no dogs inspite of 3x advising hostess . I called and complained nobody cared . Stay away from this dump ! Another dog was on patio with water bowls . I don't get if they must of played lead roll in dumb and dumber"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but the service is horrible. No reservations on the weekend. The hostess had a smirk, heavy sigh and eye roll to match a surly teenager! The food runners had no idea who ordered what, and we had already waited a long time for our order, then had to help; further adding to the poor service experience! Coffee was good! Overall experience marred by poor service!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  My fav restaurant in Ahwatukee!  I have been many times and it is always tasty!  Normally I get the burger!  So good!  I have also had breakfast here!  Mmm oh and salads are great! Service is great and you can sit outside if you would like!"}
{"text":"Ok Hillside Spot, you had this coming for awhile. I have been here at least 15 times probably because it's the only place around that is not a chain and makes somewhat healthy/gourmet type food. That being said I always leave somewhat disappointed with the hope that next time could possibly be better. I have dined here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with and without kids. The biggest thing I notice is the service is always horrible, just always. The food comes out very very slowly. The servers look like they have much more important things to be doing besides serving and are very dull and bland in personality and enthusiasm for the place. They just don't care. Once the server forgot my coffee the whole time and since he never came back until he dropped the check, I had to get a free coffee card for next time. On that, the coffee is good, but how can you really go wrong with Cartel?  Ok as for the chefs, why do they always forget stuff that should come with my food? There is no value here at all, it is very overpriced. The Tunisian salad I had was $9.58 with tax. the salad is just veggies and olives. They forgot my kale. $3, $4, and $5 more to add chx, shrimp or steak. The salad probably costs $1 to make unfortunately I feel cheated. It's not large, I am a 117 lbs girl so that is saying something if I feel the portions are too small. It was good though, I must admit but not even worth the price. The food is hit or miss. I like the grilled (elote) corn, the cheeseburger is pretty damn good, the bbq pork was good, guacamole is good. Levain and lox is amazing. croque madame is bland, vegetable torta not very good, tuna is boring, spot chop is ok....i cant remember what else I had right now.  All in all, please just step up your game, make sure those chefs are getting that food made right and timely and hire some servers who maybe give a damn. Think about the value of your food, run some promotions or something. BTW, I do like Gallo Blanco a lot, but again not a very good value."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food for such a small and quaint location.  I came in with the running group and ordered the Carne Asada Torta with a side of mexican corn on the cob, and it blew me away.  Some of the best food I've had in the area!  The service was a little slow, but not too terrible that would keep me from coming back.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"cute hippie bohemian spot with homemade goodies in glass dishes...old schoolin' it in tukee....friendly waitress...had awesome carne asada sandwich...prickly pear tea...my boss had chili querdes or whatever that egg dish is called...looked great...it was all very delightful and tasty visit!"}
{"text":"This place is the best !! I am a regular ! The nice relaxed vibe really makes the experience of eating here always a great one! Staff is always so friendly! Anything on the breakfast menu is amazing! Also a great place to go and just enjoy and nice glass of wine!"}
{"text":"I hate hate hate that I have to dole out a fiver to Hillside Spot - To quote the paranoid pot dealing hippie from ''Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle', It's my baby.    HSS rotates a variety of killer local and  semi-local handles and, regardless of how overly complicated their menu is, the food fucking rocks. (see that side o' roasted corn? Get that shit.  It will change you).   HSS is a strange yet wonderful beast.  It's either crammed to the rafters randomly in the middle of the week or oddly (and gorgeously) bereft of any and all humanity.  The later is especially nice when I roll in after any form of exercise I deem 'worthy of a beer'.  Long story short, if you haven't tried it, try it.  But not when I'm there.  This is getting uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Looked like a good neighborhood place. Service was fair at best. We had some beers and appetizers which were decent. The problem occurred when the bill came. Our bill was just over $30 which we thought was great and saw they had applied the happy hour discount.  We put down two 20 dollar bills. When the change came it was shorted by about 3 dollars. We told the waiter who said he would fix it. He comes back and the bill went up by $3 and says the change was now correct.Not worth the fight but don't like getting jacked like that."}
{"text":"Its so wonderful to have a great place like this in Ahwatukee.  Pancakes are the best.  I said BEST!.  I really love the croque monsieur, but change it up to a madam by putting a fried egg on top.  Ask for extra bechamel sauce, they can be a little stingy with the good stuff sometimes.  They serve Cartel coffee here which as any good Pheonician knows is the best in the valley if not the country.  Fresh orange juice is great.  I did stop by once for a burger - which was good with only one caveat - juicy burger on soft bread with no layer of mayo (as Alton Brown suggests) to keep the bun from becoming a squishy mess.  Good fries, fresh cut and fried."}
{"text":"Hmm. Yeah, ok--p good. You should go here. You will feel cool here. Reasonable flavors. V convenient. No bees. Salt and pepper on the tables and whatnot. Good--yeah. Good."}
{"text":"Great spot with variety and quality food. Service was prompt and the omlets and chiliquiles were amazing. I was very impressed and eager to go back."}
{"text":"This is a go to spot for us for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. We are here pretty often, so can say that it is consistently good.   The breakfast sandwiches and varied egg dishes are delicious and satisfying. The pancakes are light and fluffy.  We mostly get chicken related sandwiches are the full mesquite chicken or salads for lunch and dinner. The chicken is always spot on and very tasty. We wish there were more vegetarian options since we have been underwhelmed with them before (other than the salads, which are great).   We usually get the fries for sides, which are great but the corn is fantastic as well.  They always have a handful of good beers on tap and a huge selection of cans and bottles.   Service is usually very good.   Over several years we've only had one bad food experience with the Friday fish special and it was quickly remedied.   We'll keep coming back and would  be here even more often if they had more veggie options."}
{"text":"BLT was good. Loved the bread.  The service wasn't all that and I was sitting at the counter and passed by my server several time. Doubt I'd go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"I have been here 4-5 times and have had overall good experience.  Food has always been delicious for breakfast and lunch. The service had been occasionally spotty with long wait times to get a server, but once the server came over I've never had a problem.  I will absolutely continue to go and support this local business."}
{"text":"Eh. Was very unimpressed. Came here for Mother's Day breakfast as it was the only Ahwatukee area breakfast joint I could find with healthy menu options that wasn't a chain.   First, the ok part. The food wasn't bad. Nothing special, but not bad for a quick breakfast. I had the farmer's omelette with fruit on the side. My boyfriend got a breakfast burritto that he said was pretty good, but the \"potatoes\" inside were just french fries. Really?   We were seated on the patio, which was fine because it was fairly shaded. There were flys EVERYWHERE. I understand that there is only so much they can do when you're outside, but it was gross. and, the seat cushions were all filthy.   The service sucked. The hostess was just sort of dumb, and not especially friendly. We did get our drinks refilled in a timely fashion, which I appreciate, but our waitress had zero personality. zero. When we first sat down she came up to the table, without even saying hi, and took the sweetener packets off the table to give to the table next to us. Didn't say a word. When my boyfriend's mom asked about the hashbrowns, the waitress said \"they're just hashbrowns\". It's like she didn't know how to communicate with real people.   Given the owners of the place, I expected A LOT more. It's fine for a quick bite to eat, but don't expect friendly service our outstanding food. Ahwatukee could really use a quality breakfast joint, too."}
{"text":"Still love Hillside Spot.  The management seem to do one thing particularly well besides quality yum food- they seem keep their employees happy.  Many of the staff are have been employed there for years and are very professional, friendly and laid back group. Just a unique feature of this restaurant vs. others in this area."}
{"text":"Live in the area and really want this restaurant to be good. I imagine my SO and I riding our bikes and enjoying the beautiful patio. The soft wood smoke emanating from the cozy fireplace is alluring. Alluring that is till you sit down. Regretfully, the food is marginal and the servers seem aloof. For example, ordered a BBQ sandwich. The dry meat required more than the sparse amount of sauce served. I flagged down server. She brought a bottle cap size portion. When I received my bill they charged me for the \"side\" of sauce. OK, maybe my expectations are too high but that and many previous visits with unmotivated staff and Arby's quality food has forced my to ride on by."}
{"text":"Was here for breakfast earlier this morning.  Pancakes were nothing special aside from the toppings (bananas, candies peanuts and peanut butter). Ordered my egg over medium and it came out over cooked. Server was very friendly!  Iced toddy (cold brew) was also very good (I added vanilla and caramel to it).  I would give my breakfast experience 4 stars.   Came back this afternoon for the Happy hour spread and was way less impressed than earlier.  $10 graze board was good and our drinks (wine and beer) were also nothing to complain about.  We sat at the bar, where 3 different servers were standing. 2 were discussing how hungover they were from the night before.  One of them ordered a meal and then proceeded to eat said meal at the prep area in front of the food window.  We also observed one of the cooks wearing gloves take out his cell phone, text, put his phone back into his apron and then walk over and handle food from the grill/line (no change of gloves nor hand washing in between).  The ice bins were left open the majority of time we were here, and the ice bath the (uncovered) berries had sat in that morning was only water for our afternoon visit (berries still uncovered).    This might sound slightly nitpicky, however as a fellow member of the food service industry, my eye for food safety is always focused.  Because we did not witness the same conditions at breakfast as we did at happy hour, I wouldn't mind coming back for another morning meal. Past the breakfast hour however, I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Despite getting pooped on by a bird whilst sitting outside waiting for my breakfast i have to say this was one of the best eating experiences ive had in a while... The service was great.. the food was phenominal.. And the prices are reasonable..."}
{"text":"Deliciousness! Fresh ingredients, awesome atmosphere, fun decor, and great service. When you order a coffee based drink it comes with complimentary coffee-art!"}
{"text":"Quality and consistency has definitely improved over the last year. The wood fired smoker/grill turns out some amazing burgers and roast chicken.  Breakfast is excellent as well. Beer selection is top notch for the 'Tuke AND you can take home a six-pack for a steal (if you pick the right ones).   Only suggestion is to get thicker patties for the burgers - the wafers are tasty but..."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Been here for both breakfast and lunch.  Breakfast was bad, lunch was good, and I need to increase the sample size if I want to possibly up the rating here.  On this last visit I ordered the Brooklyn chop salad with a side of house made potato chips.  The chips were quite good.  And the salad was one of the better salads I've had.  Romaine, radicchio, olives, sun dried tomatoes, pistachios, salami.  The salad was not over-dressed and the mix of textures and tastes was good.  My friend ordered the Derby salad which I had a bite of.  It was fine - both salads were quite fresh.  He asked for his dressing on the side so his salad was also not over-dressed.  I would definitely come back here for the salads.  It's breakfast that really lowers this rating to just okay.  Ordered the chilaquiles and was sorely disappointed.  The serving was tiny, just a small handful of chips, that has been soaked through by the time they were served.  The sauce was underwhelming.  The egg was the only thing that partially saved the dish.  I vowed never to order it again.    I'm going to be back to give breakfast another shot, and I will definitely return for lunches here.  On balance though, will stick to the 3-star review until I taste more stuff."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I've been to in a while. I can very much appreciate when a place takes the time to perfect fantastic quality food and service. Outstanding service by my waiter Taylor! Great guy! Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I see this place has lost some stars recently.  I can only assume it's to do with the poor service.  Went for breakfast today at ten.  The manager took our drink order right away.  The waitress came by and asked our drink order and we said the manager was already coming back with our drinks.  She left immediately.  She came back after a few moments and said that she will be our waitress, implying there had been some confusion about that among the wait staff.  She left again without asking if we were ready to order, which we were.  Then a third time she comes back to take our order.  The manager drops the food off at the table and the waitress comes up about two seconds after that and asks if we're okay.  We don't see her again the rest of the meal.  No drink refills, no nothing.  Even after we were finished, we waited around for ten minutes for the check.  I'm extraordinarily understanding of bad service usually.  It's usually they're short staffed or due to shit management policies that fuck things up and not the server's fault entirely if at all.  But there's was a ton of wait staff there for the amount of customers.  The kitchen wasn't backed up apparently, as our food was prompt to arrive.  The waitress was just crap.  And she seemed totally oblivious to the fact that she was crap.  She was unfriendly AND incompetent.  You should really not be both.  I hope she finds a job that suits her better.  She's woefully bad at serving the public.  Points off the the manager as well for passing our table three times and not noticing our craning necks and empty cups."}
{"text":"If you're a foodie like me, you will NOT be impressed by Hillside Spot. My boyfriend and I came here a couple of weeks ago for a quick lunch after a trip to Ikea. We ordered the Blue Sky burger and a salad/sandwich combo. Let me just say the chopped salad was delicious--but then again how can you go wrong if you use fresh ingredients? The grilled veggie sandwich, however was DIS-GUSTING. The veggies were sopping in oil/grease and were put on the driest piece of bread I've ever had. I couldn't believe that's what they considered the healthy option. The Blue Sky burger was no better...but then again we wouldn't know because the only flavor you could taste was the blue cheese. This place was the biggest disappointment in a long time.  Overall, even with three and a half stars this place is overrated. Just sayin."}
{"text":"The only thing I'll ever go back here for is the beer! You can mix and match from their beer selection for a customized 6-pack. I can't remember how much it is but I believe it is under $10.   The food/dining experiences are ALWAYS unpleasant. I've been to this restaurant to eat maybe 4-5 times and each time is absolutely terrible. I've stopped going ever since they screwed up my order the last time. It's like the servers don't speak English or something. You can tell them day in and day out, \"I can't eat dairy, mayo, or butter\" and they still shlop mayo and butter all over your dish. I remember ordering a pulled pork and they smeared mayo all over the bun. I mean, who even wants mayo on their pulled pork?? That's just disgusting, I'm sorry. Anyway, after countless times of trying to tell them how I want my food, trying to notify managers, even emailing the customer service email on their website (and got no response), I gave up! It really is a shame because I think they have the potential to put out some really good food!"}
{"text":"I've been coming her over the years and the service has consistently gone down hill. Today's treatment by the manager was by far the most blatant display of disrespect I have witnessed. We showed up with 6 people and a dog. We had all hiked 7 miles and the people and dog were just tired and hungry. After we sat down on the patio, we were questioned about the dog who is owned by a veteran. We joked saying we could just call him a service dog, but our group is not lone to take advantage. The hostess left, and in comes the manager tell us that the dog had to go and there was a seat outside the patio area for three. (Literally 6 feet from the table we were at. Our group was split with no effort to at least more us close enough to have a conversation even though there is plenty of room. We accepted it, we were quiet. In comes a woman with a small dog and the same interaction occurs, but this time, the manager accepts that the dog will sit on her lap on the patio. double standard? Absolutely, especially since the dog was not in her lap. Rude, inconsistent and fair food at best. Our waitress however was very accommodating and  tried to make the best out a blatantly disrespectful situation. Enforce or don't enforced"}
{"text":"The service isn't fantastic especially when it's crowded but that's why I make a point to go when I have plenty of time just to lounge and relax - the atmosphere of the restaurant lends itself to that kind of dining experience anyways.    But on to the meat of it... the food!!  Pulled pork sandwich was absolutely fantastic.  Great flavor but with a nice twist to it and the guacamole was very light, yet still substantial and had a kick of flavor to it (might've been pineapples in this, I can't remember).  Croque monsiuer was also melt-in-your-mouth good. Just very fresh fare overall.  Can't love the service, but go there when you have time to lounge, chat with some friends, and share some good food!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed my breakfast experience several times at Hillside Spot  due to the variety of creative food.  I would like to continue enjoying the dining experience at Hillside, so I want to offer some simple suggestions.  When tables are bused make sure they get wiped down and silverware  and napkins are restocked.  When the food runner brings out the order make sure to read the ticket so you know that the order is complete.  Pay attention to small details like bring the correct bill to the table and notice when water glasses need to be refilled.  Have the staff work together as a team so everyone will notice dishes that need to picked up, empty or missing silverware containers, and making sure that outside areas are free of items left behind by the local birds.  You have great food please pay attention to the small details that make a business great."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!! We had the same server as last time we came it had been a few months we figured we would try it Again Thursday at 345 late lunch not a very busy time worst I have ever gotten!! I work in a restaurant and I am so tolerant to mediocre service but this was just BAD having worked in the service industry for 12 years this was awful took 5+ minutes just to get greeted me and my two guests all ordered beers my beer was kicked ok no problem took a while longer my girlfriends beer wasn't even the right one.. I order a different beer because after 10+ minutes she tells me the keg is no good (basically they don't have another one) meanwhile my friend had already ordered his second beer still hadn't gotten it long story short we were there for 30+ minutes my friend had 1 beer my girlfriend 0 and me half of a hefe from a kicked keg.. Definitely won't be back wanted to take my friend from out of town for a late lunch they seemed like we could get a good happy hour there but never again"}
{"text":"I started going there just because it's nearby, but now it's become a bit of a destination for me.  I find the atmosphere is just right, and this time of year (early Fall) they keep the rollup doors open allowing interior to flow into the patio area--though flies can get annoying. They also have good WiFi with power outlets thoughtfully provided all around the long bench area. It's a good place to camp out with a laptop and work or browse for a bit, which is frequently what draws me there.   Upon entering I always get a whiff of something delicious. This varies through the day. In the morning it's bacon. Lunchtime smells like bbq. Dinner can smell like chorizo.  The kitchen in an open area where you can see -- and smell -- everything as it happens.  The sandwiches are larger than most people's heads and ingredients are very good. I enjoy the cold turkey sandwich on wholegrain with the guacamole.  The chilaquiles aren't really chilaquiles. They aren't the ones I remember from student days in Mexico. They're more like tostadas.  Taste good enough, but a bit disappointing.  Service is always good. The music can be a bit loud, but the selections are appropriate for the kind of place.  All in all, one of my favorite places in the area morning, noon and night."}
{"text":"Well this is a good way to start your day.  And you can pair your delicious huevos rancheros with a beer. Or mimosa."}
{"text":"The food here is good but the service is always lacking. Without fail someone other than the server drops off the food and then you are abandoned by the server. FYI - when someone's food is delivered, they will most likely need salsa, butter, jelly, etc...  Every time I have to go inside and track someone down to get something while our food gets cold outside. Today was the last straw so we won't bother visiting again."}
{"text":"The food was great but the waitress with the short red hair seemed to hate her job so maybe she should look for another position.  But I will come again and request someone else."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a snob coffee barista this is your spot. I ordered a carmel macchiatto \"ICED\", and was told this can't be done as its traditionally an expresso with carmel and foam on the top. AS i recall being in the 21st century there was the invention of ice cubes and the barista magically was able to make this happen. Listen asshole i am from seattle and have ordered more Carmel Macchiattos \"With ICE\" with out some snob ass little kid defining a technical process for how coffee is made."}
{"text":"Cool place, comfortable. Sorely needed in the 'Tuke.  Went for lunch today.  Slow ordering process and a bit crowded with food items on shelves right behind the ordering line...need to move that stuff and free up space for people to comfortably read the menus and get ready to order.  The ice tea set up needs some reorganization...it's a deadend into the windows and tables and people cannot flow through as they should to keep things moving.  Turkey sandwich was good - not great, but good.  Appeared pretty lonely on a lunch plate with a sliver of a pickle...come on it's a pickle you can charge more but at least give us a bit more than a sliver.  Ordered my sandwich and asked for mustard but no mayo - they skipped the mustard AND the mayo.  How about a few chips, or a bit of pasta salad on the plate to keep my turkey sandwich company....  If you go with a group, expect your meals to come out one at a time vs. all meals for the table at once...I noticed a lot of guests sitting there with 1 or 2 meals served while the others at their tables sat and waited...get it together Hillside - use one \"poker chip\" for the whole table and bring the food at once...  It's a cool place, they'll work out the bugs.  I'll go back to try breakfast and maybe even dinner (after Feb. 1st)...but they need to just observe the flow in the place...oh yeah, and for such a 'cool' place...who needs gas station energy drinks on the counter....de-clutter dudes it will be 'cooler' yet.  It's nice, needs to work out the kinks, but I hope it makes it...good crowd and lots more coming in as I left..."}
{"text":"So badly, do I want to give these guys five stars. And each time I visit I am hopeful for a better experience.  Unfortunately, this place has consistently poor service.  Long waits for food, incorrectly taken orders and generally inattentive servers are just a few of the problems.    What continues to frustrate me more than anything is the beer cooler in the front of the store, and the borderline dishonest pricing advertised.   Above the cooler on a chalk board they advertise two of the bombers to go for $8.99*.  Select bottles do not apply.  But they don't label the prices!  You don't find out that both bombers you chose were exempt from the deal until you are making the purchase.  I've mentioned this frustration  to the staff in the past, only to be rudely spoken down to by someone claiming to be an assistant manager and one of the beer buyers.  If this place wasn't just a couple blocks from my home I would have never returned after my initial bad experience.  But they are close and convenient, and at certain times they are the only alternative to fast food in the immediate area.  Their food has been pretty good for the most part....I just wish they could get their service and their craft beer issues solved so I can start recommending this place to friends again."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place in Ahwatukee. Food is consistently very good."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast this morning. The breakfast burrito was very taste, so was the Mexican omlette with toast. They had a choice of grape or strawberry jam we chose the strawberry jam. It was delicious with big pieces of strawberry. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Always good food at Hillside Spot. Huevos rancheros, pancakes, chorizo omelette and hash browns are highly recommended. Also, great mimosas and beer on tap and tons of options in bottle."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with my daughter here last weekend and we were pleasantly surprised. The place was very crowded and with a line waiting to be seated which lets you know there is something good about it.  The service was not great but not bad considering how crowded it was, but the food was delicious. We order the egg and chorizo torta which is a basically a sandwich but with a different kind of bread. Knowing what a torta really is supposed to taste,  this was very close  and very good. The percentage of chorizo to the egg was perfect!    We also ordered a bowl of fruit and it was good, no cantaloupe, honey dew or grapes, it had different berries and types of fruit. All the dishes they serve to other people also looked very good.  The only thing I thought was very expensive was the latte and the chia  and had to send it back once as they brought something I did not order. I will definitely will go back and try some other food!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have Hillside on our side of town!  As someone in the restaurant business, I can be hard to impress.  But these guys are great!  The food was excellent and the service was friendly without being intrusive.  Love the little details like the recycled wine bottles for glasses and the Queen Creek Olive Oil.  Get the grazers - the bread, the cheeses, and the homemade pesto were all awesome!  Love this unpretentious, yummy, and sexy new hangout!   See Nathan at the bar - he rocks!  Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"We had a five-star experience, so came back less than 24 hours later. That one was more like 4 stars, so four it is.   I had the Croque Madame both times. The first time, it was absolutely spectacular. Everything I wanted. Perfectly cooked, egg was runny and amazing. Just delightful. The next day, it was considerably slower inside, but my edges were slightly burnt and my egg wasn't runny at all. A little bummed at the night-and-day from one day to the next.   The Mexican corn with Oaxaca was pretty awesome. Got it on recommendation of our server the second day, and was super pleased. Outrageously messy, but good.   The mister got something yummy the first day which I don't remember (but clearly was good enough he didn't complain about going back the next day), and the special turkey reuben the second time. Reuben was interesting - coleslaw instead of sauerkraut. I wasn't totally sold on the idea, but he was happy with it.   We sat on the back patio until our food came. The swarm of flies was tolerable when we didn't have food on the table, but I spent more time swatting them away and defending my plate than I did eating what was on it, so we moved inside. Sat inside the second day and still noticed a few flies on the window, but the experience was much more tolerable.   Friendly service, tasty food, and breakfast available all day. (Super important to a third-shifter!) We'll be back."}
{"text":"We don't live in the area of Hillside so whenever we come down to Chandler we love to eat breakfast/brunch here. Nice, diverse menu. Good lattes. Beats all those chain restaurants. Try the croque madame!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Ahwatukee. They have great food (nothing is frozen or microwaved), and amazing beer on tap. They also have great craft beer night on Thursday night, and you can mix and match a 6 pack for $9! Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. The food is reliably fresh and delicious. Love the vibe and neighborhood feel. EVERYTHING on the menu is good and some of my favorites are the farmer omelet, huevos rancheros, carne asada salad, and their cold processed coffee is spectacular. This place makes me so happy and it also has dog-friendly tables outside."}
{"text":"I heard great things about Hillside Spot from a friend. I will never consider his recommendations again.  The service was terrible.   Our waiter fucked everything up.. everything. Forgetful.. messed up each order. The family next to us had similar problems.. but worse. Waiter gave all the kid's food to another table. So the parents were already done eating when their kids finally received their grub.   The food was nothing special.. Maybe worth 2.5 stars. This Spot was boo boo. I've had better experiences at Waffle House."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's fresh, local, and tasty. The service has improved tremendously over the past year! My fiancé and I go here on a regular basis and we are never let down. I recommend the turkey press with fig jam and the mesquite grilled chicken."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner. YES! Dinner! And I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the overabundance of  delightful quaintness.  I've been here before, once, for breakfast and I was left with a general \"meh\" impression, too. But at 8:20pm on a weekend night I was indecisive and decided to try this place out with their dinner menu.  I ordered some Four Peaks beer (which I'm really happy this place does all local stuff) and a Suki Rice Bowl. Delicious! I loved it! Then ordered a latte that was served beautifully. Then decided to do some cake. BAM! Awesome.  And the atmosphere was great. Low candle light, doors open to let the beautiful night air in, friendly and helpful staff. Maybe I just hit gold that night, or maybe I was drunk, but it was a lovely place for dinner and to hang out with my husband, who also really enjoyed his meal. All the other people that were there seemed to be enjoying the vibe and just happy to hang out.  I don't know that I will go back for breakfast, but I'm certainly going to head back there sometime for dinner."}
{"text":"Boy have they improved since they opened!  I just met a friend here for brunch this morning and it was great. We both had mimosas which were excellent and I had some egg white omelet loaded with fresh veggies. I'm proud to have this great restaurant right in my hood!"}
{"text":"Cafferteria eatery price right fresher ingredient than McDonald for about $2 more. No signature dishes but cooked OK. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"User to love this spot but may have come under new management recently. Ordered my go to breakfast burrito today and it came out without chorizo and avocado. The waiter wasn't quick to apologize or offer a good solution so I just asked for a side of avocado. That didn't make it out before all of my friends were done eating. Super disappointing. We also ordered mimosas which were unsatisfying as well. While they were tasty there was so little mimosa in the glass that it felt like a total waste of money ordering one. This was overall an unexpected downer. Unfortunately won't be coming back. Used to love this place so very sad."}
{"text":"Amazing place, would love to go if possible. Had their chilaquiles and they left me amazed! Definitely would go back. They even had freshly squeezed orange juice!   Must go!"}
{"text":"As a Hillside regular I feel 4/5 stars is not quite the perfect rating - I wish I could give them 4.5 stars as 90% of my experiences with the food and service have been excellent.    Those experiences that comprise the 90% include breakfasts, lunches, and dinners.  Amazing pancakes, best bacon in the valley (seriously, big props for the bacon), huevos rancheros yum, chilaquiles to die for, awesome burgers, great beer selection, and I am in love the Cocina 10 items!  The servers are friendly, knowledgeable about the menu (both food and beverage), and make the overall experience at Hillside enjoyable.  The other 10% - the bad - have occurred in the mornings on the weekends when they're in the middle of a rush.  New rule - if I have to wait more than 5 mins for a table at Hillside I have to walk away.  They just don't seem to properly staff those peak times and both service and food quality suffer.  Final words... outside of 8:30am-10:30am on Saturday and Sunday I will continue to visit Hillside for any meal of the day.  Great food!  If you haven't been... go!"}
{"text":"This place struggles.  We have come and have good food but terrible service.  Other times we have terrible service but good food.  The last stop falls under the former, we stopped by to check out their happy hour specials which were great for beer and wine, but our server didn't mention any food specials like the HH Menu photos state.  The boy ordered the Brisket Burrito special which he liked, but was mostly full of filler and not a lot of brisket.  I ordered the Blue Sky Cheeseburger with fries and was disappointed.  The beef had no seasoning what so ever and tasted flat.  The french-fries were cold and soggy and the side of ranch dressing was runny and flavorless.  The Boy watched our food sit in the warmer window for about 5 min before it was served.  There are some menu items that are truly worth the trip but with the Russian roulette of bad service good food and good service bad food it makes it hard to want to come back."}
{"text":"So here it is, sometimes if you have more than one bad experience in a row you just have to say goodbye.  Well that was a few years ago and I have been back to Hill Side for coffee and desert a few times and we have enjoyed it!  I like the atmosphere and the fact that you can have coffee, desert and good conversation."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places! The staff is always amazing and the food is to die for! Breakfast here is the best!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is cute in a nice neighborhood. Service was really good. My friend ordered huevos rancheros and he said it was pretty good. I had a Croque Madame and I was pretty disappointed because it didn't have any bechamel sauce. It was just an open faced ham and cheese sandwich with an egg on it. The coffee was decent. For $14 I thought my food wasn't that great but I enjoyed the overall experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spots. Good food, good atmosphere, original menu with fresh ingredients and just one of those places that makes you want to come back again. I love supporting local, and have had great experiences every time I've come here. The Asada salad is one of my favorites. If breakfast is more your taste, the chilequiles are SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I went to the Hillside Spot last week with a friend last week. I had read all abut their less than stellar service, but the service was actually very good for us. We just both thought the food was mediocre. I got a burger with bacon, caramelized onions, and an egg on it and my friend got the croque monsieur. The burger was good but nothing terribly special and the fries were kind of soggy and flavorless. My friend thought the same about her food. I got a slice of chocolate cake to go and it tasted very box -ish. It wasn't bad and it was very large, but it didn't have a homemade flavor. Although this place was alright, I don't think I would be back too soon."}
{"text":"Pulled pork, corn on the cob with the cotija, salsa, french fries, coffee. They do everything well."}
{"text":"I keep coming back because it's a fun place in Ahwatukee and the food is always good, but takes forever to get served (even when it's not busy). Love the decor and quality of the food, but the service is always disorganized (not sure if it's the kitchen or servers). If you want a quick bite, this is unfortunately not the place... Ordering a simple dish will keep you there for close to 2 hours."}
{"text":"This was my first time in and I was very impressed! I had the oatmeal which was absolutely amazing, and I loved how friendly and speedy the service was! Will definitely be going back soon to try out some of the other options on the menu."}
{"text":"After being a customer for many years, we will not be back.  My wife's salad had a lot of rusty lettuce.  She sent it back for a burger.  My chicken dinner with fries was cold and should have been sent back too.    We question the staffs' understanding of food safety."}
{"text":"Had not been to Hillside for awhile. Went this morning, busy but no wait. Had the Farmers omelet. And a cup of coffee. The food was great , service outstanding and price was right. Nice to see $1.75 for Coffee instead of $3.00 at other places."}
{"text":"I was brought to this place by a friend who set some high expectations. Those expectations were exceeded.  We stopped in for a late breakfast on a Saturday morning and only had about a 5 minute wait. It's not a very big dining area and we ended up sharing a large table with another party of two (a couple chairs separating us).  I decided on the \"build your own omelette\" option which had plenty of ingredients to choose from. They definitely don't short side you on the portions either; my omelette was stuffed. My friend got banana pancakes (a la jack johnson) which were also outstanding.    It's a great local concept and features ingredients from local farmers as well as microbrew 6-packs for purchase. Awesome atmosphere, friendly service, and great food. Highly recommend Hillside to all my fellow yelpers."}
{"text":"The food was good.  Nothing fancy, but certainly of quality.  They have a simple menu, we ordered a variety of items, all of which were prepared well and tasted good.  We did share a pancake.   It was a memorable pancake.  Light and tasty!    I ordered ham and eggs.  Ham was less salty, which I prefer.  The 9 grain toast was delicious.  My sig-o ordred the egg white vege omelet with fruit.   Fresh, good quality and the sun-dried tomatoes were \"yummy.\"  Good service.   If there weren't as many flies, there'd be 4 stars."}
{"text":"We decided to check out a local joint for brunch. It's our first weekend in our new place in Ahwatukee. This place is great for ambience. It's a cool looking joint. The coffee is TERRIFIC! The food - at least what we had - was mediocre. The disappointment was that this place has the makings to be a great joint - not just ok.   My husband had the Corque sandwich. It was ok but the sandwich didn't have enough spread & was a bit dry. He also ordered hashbrowns. Wow, how can you mess up hashbrowns? Well, make them like shoestrings & serve them cold. That's how ya jack up hashbrowns.   Anyway, I had the egg, avacado & chorizo burro. The menu offers brisket & pulled pork. I asked to sub the chorizo with brisket & was told that the brisket & pulled pork weren't ready yet. Another disappointment. So I chose chicken. My food arrived & it was ok but flavorless. No seasoning - at least none I could distinguish. Their fire roasted salsa came with it & it was very good. (I ordered a point to take home with me). It was what made the burro edible.   Service was slow. They were busy but I waited almost 20 min for my salsa & the check. My server was nice & she was good at checking on us & keeping the coffee flowing. Just slow at the end of our meal with the check, salsa & change.   Will we go back? Maybe. I think we may try their lunch. You know how it is - sometimes a place is good at one or the other - lunch or breakfast - but maybe not both. But so far we rate it a 3 star.... maybe lunch will change my mind."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you've got time to spare and don't mind waiting. I really wanted to like this place and even had a four-star review for it previously. However, I've come back four times and each time gets significantly worse - mainly the time it takes to get served. The most recent time, I sat outside for more than 15 minutes before I even got a menu. I also find myself saying \"no, I only have an hour, I can't go to Hillside\". Such a shame because they are super close to me, their atmosphere is nice, and food is pretty good. Their staff is friendly and I believe they're doing their best, but maybe they're not used to the size of the restaurant it is because it can be a 10-15 minutes between the times your server comes by. Making it easily an hour or two ordeal, even if you're by yourself. But hey, if  you've got a good two or three hour window to have a sit down meal, this is the place to come!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an amazing dinner there Wednesday evening. Service was superb and the food was delicious! Definitely returning for dinner. Salmon was the fish of the day - highly recommend whenever they have  that available. Lovely patio to enjoy the Spring time temperatures."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service. BBQ brisket sandwich special was spicy but delicious. Burgers and turkey sandwich were wonderful. Very hip, friendly place. We will be back"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat and hang out in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Great breakfast selection and a well sourced local and wholesome use of ingredients. The \"Callejero Style\" corn on the cob is one of the best items on their menu. The mesquite grill always delivers fantastic smells and titillates your taste buds. The Chilaquiles Verdes is my favorite breakfast selection, almost rivaling Chelsea's Kitchen's version...almost... Great for road and mtn. bikers."}
{"text":"I have downgraded this place to three stars since the last couple of times I have been there I haven't gotten very good service. My husband and I went there for lunch today and had to wait for over 45 minutes for our food. My husband's meal was very overcooked and mine was not exactly what I had ordered. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm pretty ticked off at hillside right now.  First, the only reason it is not a 1 star is because I have been there enough times during the day and was pleased with the food, however, my wife and I tried their dinner service the other night and it was just horrible.  The server was nice and on point but the food was pathetic.  The \"Gallo\" guac was brown and tasteless and the half the chips were burnt.  I've had that several times at the Phoenix restaurant and it is amazing so I was excited for my wife to try it... huge disappointment.  Then the salad that is amazing at gallo every single time was garbage.  It was 95% cabbage, 2 very small pieces of kale, not enough dressing and very bland.  Lastly, the fries were soggy...ahhhh..I seriously hate that, so we sent those back and they brought out another batch exactly the same.  When we spoke to the manager, instead of apologizing right off the bat, he was combative and immediately started to explain to us that they use the same recipes as during the day.... hello, anybody can use the same recipe and screw it up if you are using bad avacados... just another hint on that, splash it with a little more lime juice and it might...might have been acceptable, but I doubt it.  Then he started to explain away the fries and how they were having a problem with the frier, so why make it worse and bring me out another bad batch?  Anyway, we were so mad by the end of our dinner and we conversed with another couple that also just got done berating the manager on their way out the door.  It was seriously horrible."}
{"text":"Excuse me as this is my first Yelp post, so my details are a bit scattered!  I've been to the Hillside Spot about 3 times and have also turned away a few times b/c it was either too busy on a weekend morning or closed on a night.  More recently my girlfriend and I stopped in and it was very nice.  Quiet, chill, not busy, and a relaxed place for some dinner and a drink.  It is truely from my experience, the only resturant like it in the area as far as attitude, healthy fair, and service.  I had the wings and a Nut Brown Ale and each were pretty good.  My girl had a salad which she though was very good.  I'd say it's not a top notch amazing place but serves its purpose for the area!"}
{"text":"Decided to go check this place out since seen good reviews on yelp very charming place waitress sat up down sun was beaming on us so I ask waitress to move us to a more shaded area she had no issue on moving us manager (Omar ) came and told us he couldn't move us do to waitress does not have that area I kindly told him it's really hot and sun is just beaming on us he still don't want to move us then finally he said if you move you'll have to just sit there and wait till a waitress gets to you guys I was like what's the big deal there's a open table and at this point I told him ok we will wait it just the most awkward situation omar was just to weird and rude about it it didn't make no sense anyhow we sat at new table waitress was so awesome she came right over took are order and didn't mind to serve us even tho diego said it wasn't her area of work I didn't get waitress name but she was just so awesome thank you really appreciate it  she gave us great service thanks again :) food was great by the way no complaints on food just Omar needs to be a lil cooler and not a duche bag... Hopefully next time you just take a lil consideration"}
{"text":"Great food and beer  But the worst service I have experienced in a long time. I had to ask another waiter for menu, and it took 15 min to receive 2 simple water. Again, food is great no doubt, however the service is poor. I believe they should hire more professional waiters as the place is popular."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Hillside after rave reviews from my boss so when he suggested he take all of us to lunch there for Administrative Assistant Day several of us anxiously accepted.   Got there about 11:30 on a Thursday, 3 tables outside and about half of the tables inside were occupied. Food being prepared looked awesome. Following directions the 7 of  us sat ourselves in the back at a long table. A very nice waiter came over gave us menus and took our drink orders. It literally took 15 minutes to get our drinks and to have our order taken. I ordered the turkey sandwich with a side of fries. After ordering it took another 45 minutes to receive our food. My sandwich and fries looked great. Quality ingredients prepared with care. To my surprise my fries..ice cold, not  luke warm, but cold like when you go to throw away the McDonald's bag and there is one elusive fry that has tried to escape, and you know its not going to be that salty, crunchy, greasy, hot fry you want but you have to eat it anyway and then regret it. It was that type of cold. The bread on the sandwich had been sitting out so long it felt like it had been toasted, but it hadn't. It was such a shame too because the turkey was flavorful and the lettuce, tomato and avocado so fresh. Honestly though, I have had a better turkey sandwich at QT for $5 and it came with chips and a drink.  A co-worker ordered the Chilaquiles Verde and hers was so cold the cheese had congealed and the yolk on fried egg on top had started dry out, . My boss asked if she wanted to send it back but since we had already been there over an hour she said no.  Someone else ordered the Mesquite Rotisserie Chicken, he said it looked better than it tasted.  Our waiter even though nice but way over worked..they looked a little short staffed. He was working all of the outside tables plus several inside and the flow of the cafe just didn't look like it worked. We never received refills on our drinks and my pricky pear ice tea was the high spot of my experience.  Hillside uses quality ingredients and maybe I just visited on a off day, but from what I had today I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Nice selection of unique food and beers...we love that it's so close to home yet feels like a trendy date place.  :-)"}
{"text":"Oh Hillside Spot, how I love your delicious food, your corner location, your wonderful patio with that fantastic fireplace, your simple yet quirky decor.  I inhale my food when I sit down at your tables.  I smell, I observe, I look, I simply fall in love at first bite and then I do this thing with my fork, my mouth and the plate until the plate is clean.    Your coffee is that of the coffee gods, my blood veins literally come alive at first sip, only to have my body leave comatose some time later!    Hillside Spot, why on earth did I ever try your pancakes...  Why did I try letting you \"Hit the Spot\", whoa there Yelper....  that's Hit the Spot pancakes.  I DON'T eat carbs.  What's wrong with you serving me those?  The sugar, the whipped butter, the syrup, the pancakes, the bananas, the caramel, the everything you put on any of your pancakes.  I've tried them all and I'm just not sure I can stop eating those pancakes and it scares me.  The warm soft cushy pancake smeared with the butter that has been drowned in syrupy goodness.  The way I insanely start from the middle and eat the pancake from the inside out, leaving the rim on the pancake.  Its all so sinful... Sinfully good that is.  Thank the breakfast gods for your omelettes, I can redeem myself and exhibit some self control when i have the farmer's omelette or the El Jefe, sans the potatoes with egg whites.  I even get tickled that you charge me 50 cents for the side of salsa with my omelette.     I'm still hopeful that one day, the service at my favorite breakfast place in Phoenix will improve and I can update this review with some fresh bling!  Until then, you're actually saving me some carbs, because I'd be back so much more often if the service were top notch."}
{"text":"I must start this off with saying that Hillside Spot is one of my favorite restaurants in town and I consider a pleasant hidden gem of the city!  I like the food, the space, and the chai tea makes my world go round.  With that being said there are some serious reoccuring issues with this place that never seem to get fixed.  I know its lame to rip on service because any server can simply be having a bad day on any given time you are being served by them.  But they have some very consistent service issues.   First, they have a beautiful, young, eclectic staff that seems to move around very fast and work pretty hard.  Sad to say, they are all learning the bad habits of each other and there is almost NO service factor present.  The in general tone of the servers isn't friendly and they don't go above and beyond.   I could list one hundred ways to change this around but there is only one key thing that really needs to be noted.  It looks like this place took out the middleman (bus boy) and the kitchen expeditor.  That is great, servers don't have to tip out so they get to keep all their tips.  But....now they are so focused on cleaning up they spend less time on other things.  The lack of a true kitchen expeditor guiding where the food goes and putting the last minute touches on the food that goes out is killing this place.  Most of the time you will find your server with his or her back turned to you while they are waiting around the island in the middle of their kitchen.  Its so crazy to have servers waiting around for food when there is so much they can do.   Hire a kitchen guru.  Have your servers helping out at the front handing out free muffin samples to waiting guests.  Pick up straw and/or torta wrappers as people are dining. Fill that water glass before the end of the meal. Ask to heat up that pastry when someone orders it.   Come on Hillside.  Go beyond just asking what someone wants and then throwing it down in front of them! I'm a huge fan and I'm rooting for you."}
