{"text":"I like this place. It's close to home, the price is right, and the family owner-operators are very friendly. The hot and sour soup is the best I've ever had, delicious, spicy, and loaded with veggies and meat. This is my go-to for Chinese food in North Collinwood."}
{"text":"It's passable, but it's called \"The New Jackie Chen's\" now, and the OLD Jackie Chen's was 20 times better. Same old, same old greasy-spoon AmeriChinese."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for some late evening Chinese food after a few drinks down the street.  Walking in, it seemed like it could use a little bit of TLC, but it was clean and that's really all that matters for take-out, right? 

The woman at the cash register was very pleasant and, even though there was definitely a little bit of a language barrier, she engaged in conversation with us while we pondered our food orders.

Everyone ordered something differs so we were able to see a wide variety of what Jackie's has to offer.  I got the general tso's chicken with rice.  By the time we got home with our food, my mouth was watering from the delicious smells wafting from the bag.  I really enjoyed the chicken... It wasn't very spicy, but next time I'll know that I can handle more than the \"medium\" spice level.  One of the girls ordered donuts (thinking it was 1 donut) and ended up with a box full of little puffed up discs of fried dough rolled in sugar.  Of course we all helped ourselves and were very happy we did!  For $2, you can't go wrong with that dessert.

Overall, this is a good option for takeout!"}
{"text":"There are very few places in Cuyahoga County that I call my favorite and this family run restaurant is one of them.  I ate here before they and the neighborhood went through a remodeling and patiently waited for them to reopen.  
  My last visit came right before a major thunderstorm was passing through and I was on my bicycle looking for shelter along with being very hungry so I stopped in for some chopstick practice.  The food was excellent as usual and they always make sure your cup is full and anything you want is catered to the extreme.  
    By the way during my bicycle ride I passed two other local restaurants and each one had such a bad attitude I pushed my chances and rode to the Collingwood area.
    To test my skills with the chopsticks I ordered shrimp and vegetables along with two shrimp egg rolls.  Using the chopsticks the very crunch and fresh vegetables were fun to pick up and enjoy.  This places cooks with real shrimp and not the frozen type so the flavor is very rich and tasty.
    As the rain came down outside and my bicycle got wet I decided to order more food for later and the seafood with vegetables was perfect along with another set of chopsticks.  
     As an eligible bachelor this would be the one spot I would take a special person to enjoy dinner with me.  All others would have pick from the value menu because dinner here for me means I truly want to impress the person.
      My job being an investigative reporter has me always asking questions and trying to find out what is really going on and this place is all about making diners happy.  So set your GPS to lead you to 470 E. 152nd Street in Cleveland Ohio."}
{"text":"No. I'm not rating a martial arts movie. I'm rating Chinese food and service. But you are greeted by posters of the actor when you walk in.

As far as Chinese food goes, this place is better at making Chinese food than Jackie Chan is at acting.  And it's very inexpensive!   The food was very satisfying and came out in good time.  There's a lot of value in the lunch specials there - order the combo for $1.50 more and it is served with fried rice and an egg roll (and every one was under $6). They will substitute steamed rice or a spring roll if you wish.  I had the Hunan Tofu and it was perfectly cooked. The vegetables were fully cooked but still firm, the tofu was perfectly fried, and the spring roll was a delicious complement.  

Our service was muddled by language barriers, and we had to ask for a particular sauce three times and she did not understand our soup order.  Also, the amenities are not that great. There are paint issues on the walls. The bathrooms were clean but were outdated.    But other than that, we never had to wait around for service and everything came out quickly. 

With a little maintenance, this place could be great.  If you don't mind the atmosphere and you are all about the value, come see Jackie."}
{"text":"My favorite for inexpensive but wonderful Chinese food.  The Hot & Sour soup is among the best I've ever had.  Most dishes are made better as they include a lot of different fresh vegetables in their dishes which adds depth.  Great service from the family and always pleasant to chat with them when I come to pick up my food."}
