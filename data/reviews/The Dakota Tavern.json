{"text":"I went to The Dakota last Saturday night with a friend of mine and I was a bit dubious when we first went in because it looked kinda run down and there was an older crowd sitting around in a dark lounge area. Once the band started playing, a rockabilly trio, things really started to kick off. The dance floor got packed and everyone began to sweat. More people poured into the bar and the dancing got crazier and crazier - with Amy Winehouse lookalikes sipping cocktails and tattooed greasers flanking the bar. The people who hang out here are really friendly and I would recommend The Tavern to anyone who wants to strike up a conversation with strangers. Great energy!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about the bluegrass brunch. On Sunday I finally went!   The atmosphere and the live music are great. Our waitress was very nice too. But... I found the brunch plate overpriced. You get a simple plate of scrambled eggs, sausages, potatoes, pancakes, fruit, tea or coffee for around 20 dollars. I would have hoped to get some beans and veggies (not very expensive things) too for that price but they cost extra.  For three people a bill of 60 dollars seems a bit too much in my opinion. I wouldn't go again, sorry."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Music every night, great staff and decor.  But you should like country music if you go cause it is very country.  I like how they will have a band play 2-3 sets in a night instead of the standard 3 bands doing 45 minute sets that has become the norm.  This is also a great people watching place, watching people dance to country music is always good times.  The food is good too, I have had a shrimp salad and the mac and cheese and I hear their weekend brunch is really fun."}
{"text":"I love this bar. Great atmos with barn board and retro country parafanalia: lots of personality! Great bands from real bluegrass to rock'n country but none of that new country crap. Best pulled pork in the city. I have seen all ages there from moms and kids at bluegrass brunch, to older couples at mariachi mondays, to really happy yound revellers to hear weekend bands putting out. Really neat looking stage, great soundman, and cute and efficient staff. Bust a move under the spinning mirror ball. Just please, no line dancing-- this place is part of the Ossington happening stretch just above Dundas."}
{"text":"If you like Blue Grass music and a big family style breakfast you must check out The Dakota Tavern.  When you enter the tavern you're taken to a very eclectic scene of 70's furniture,  retro lights and positive vibes! The staff are super friendly as you wait for a family you're offered a cup of coffee from the bar.   Once seated, you've offered a mixed bowl of fresh fruit.  Then the good stuff comes out! You get a platter of pancakes, eggs and potatoes and a side of sausages. There's a ton of food for everyone and as much coffee as you want. The best part is hearing live music from a quaint local blue grass band while adults and kids flock to the dance with their latest moves. You live The Dakota Tavern with a smile and a full belly. Great spot!"}
{"text":"The Dokota Tavern is truly a unique venue. It's kinda a modern cowboy-rockabilly venue that hosts a variety of live acts, dance nights and kitcshy-square dancing type stuff. They also have one of the best Sunday brunches in the city, as voted by locals as well as this year's NOW Magazine Best Of Poll. My pal Jen owns the joint. She's one of those personal touches people who has the coziest home and makes the perfect host at summer BBQs. It's her personality that makes this spot so much fun even if modern cowboy twang isn't your thing."}
{"text":"For some reason I have real problems remembering the name of this bar, but that's no indication of how much fun I had. I went with friends from work and my little sister and had a BLAST. The bands were random and eclectic and mixtures of various genres, which was right up my alley. So much fun to dance to!  The crowd is just as random as their music, meaning laughing at terrible pick up lines, being stared down by older, greasy, albeig talented band members, kitsch chicks on barstools with martinis, a country stomping good time, dudes in plaid learning new secret hand shakes, and a group of people dancing up a storm for $10 cover.  Loved it. It's raw and entertaining and. well. random. I digg.  Don't eat breakfast at 4 am at the restaurant next door. terrible."}
{"text":"Live music. Great atmosphere. Reasonable service. At least one real microbrew on tap. Sold.  Honestly, I was sold from the moment I descended the steps into this dark, basement tavern and saw the cow skull on the wall, perfectly framed by white fairy lights. Everything else was just a bonus."}
{"text":"The Dakota is a real fun place! I have been there twice for live country music - even for those who don't like country, the live bands are fun and upbeat creating a great atmosphere, making it hard not to have a good time.  It is SMALL and it is CRAMPED and it is BUSY and loud, so its not the place to go if you want to sit down for a beer with a friend and catch up. Its a great night out with a bunch of friends.  There's a dance floor, and a decent but not amazing beer selection. The decor is old-school and fits the place really well. Recommended!"}
{"text":"A divey, artsy honky tonk bar a bit off the beaten path.  We came here on the recommendation of our lovely, tattooed waitress at Sneaky Dees.  What's up with all the cool spaces in Toronto?  The Dakota Tavern lives subterranean in a low ceiling, narrow, brick-walled space featuring a small stage, looked on by a small dancing area and a dozen tables.  A long bar runs the room to the house left of the stage.  The crowd was a little sparse for a Saturday night, consisting of a mix of young and older, artsy / hipster types.  The crowd was friendly and unpretentious (it may just be that everyone in Toronto is friendly, though).  We were treated to the countrified rock 'n roll of the stables, who had the room rockin' were their hard hitting, wash board bass driven acoustic harmonies of Calgary's The Stables.  The Dakota had a good selection of taps on pull complimented by a well stocked cooler of bottles.  I could go for a Labatt's 50 right now (seems to be Canada's PBR/High-life).  The only reason the Dakota doesn't get five stars was due to their ridiculously weak cocktails.  How can you have a rockin' cowboy bar and measure your pour when serving up a Jack and Coke?  Isn't the point of being a cowboy to drink a lot of Whiskey?  I'd stick to the beer and frequent this place if I lived in Toronto."}
{"text":"It won't suprise any of you to find out that I have been to the southern united states of america.  I don't go often, after the unplesantness in 1775, I simply don't feel welcome, but I do enjoy a spot of southern music from time to time.  My experiences are often just fine at the Dakota Tavern, located under a portugese sports bar; but this time the nerve of the young wench at the bar!  Ignoring Horace W. Mayweather is inexcusable!  Not only did she ignore me, but also my lady companion, went to the other end of the bar to serve others, and passed over us again to put away glasses.  I know they aren't as busy since the musical combo 'the beauties' don't play anymore, but therefore the service should be faster!  Rude Service is the first and last straw for a man such as myself.  We left, got back out cover charge, and had a lovely glass of Sherry at the Crooked Star.  For shame Dakota!  Bravo Crooked Star!  Toodle-Loo!  HM"}
{"text":"The Dakota Tavern is pretty cool. The ambiance is like a cross between an olde time saloon and a Weezer music video- with skulls and strings of white Christmas lights adorning the cozy walls.  I've been here several times and the crowd always seems decent in both volume of people and social quality of their personalities.  The drink princes are kinda 'meh,' staff are nice but for the size of the bar they seem pretty understaffed- you could wait up to 20 min for a drink on a packed night. Double or triple fist.  The men's washroom is pretty awkward, it's so compact that if you are a big guy in a big sweater taking a piss next to another big guy, you WILL be touching each other. Prepare yourself."}
{"text":"Great bluegrass canadiana. There was a one man band, barn doors and plenty of 12 bar shenanigans. Recommend to all aspirational dive bar enthusiasts"}
{"text":"This is THE music venue of the city. It's such a great ambiance, and the bands are great that are booked here. Some of the best nights to go are Sundays and Tuesdays are regulars, from the Beauties on Sunday to this month having Jason Collett doing a Tuesday night thing.  I've only had a bit of food here, but when I have had it it was good.  But the beer pours well. They have a good selection of local and imported beer, and the staff is always friendly.  One of time things to do here is to go on Sunday for the bluegrass brunch. Good food, great music and a great family atmosphere."}
{"text":"An alt-country live music staple, the Dakota holds its own as \"home\" to many breakout artists such as Serena Ryder, Catl, $100 and The Stables, and offers weekend Bluegrass Brunch around one giant, common table.  Don't worry if you don't feel like you look the part - the bar may look like a country saloon, but the patrons are varied and welcoming."}
{"text":"Groovy Atmosphere- Like an underground party you heard about from a friend of a friend. Lower ceilings, intimate, but roaring and fun.    The Drinks- I went with tequila, it satisfied. Good pricing too.   Coat check- There isn't one and you're going to want to get up and dance. So bring a purse or man purse for your valuables, unless you are very trusting person.   Stairs- You have to go down some to get in. You have to go up some to get out. Plan footwear and drink accordingly.   The Band- Wow, they were great. People were dancing, drinking, doing anything fun to the backdrop of their music. I wish I could remember their name. The girl was wearing a white flapper dress (helpful?). Even with her really strange birthday hat on (a cake with candles sprouting out of the top), the band invited my friend up on stage and got the whole bar in on the birthday wishes.   Go here! It is a seriously good time if you're a fan of cool music, flowing drinks, moving to the beat (no pressure though), and good times."}
{"text":"Breakfast review.  The Dakota was something new that opened up while I was away from Toronto for a while.  It's a full bar, and restaurant, and as the name might suggest, with a western theme.  I went to their Bluegrass brunch.  Kudos to the Dakota for keeping it simple. For $12 you get all you can eat scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage, pancakes, juice and coffee. During lunch there is a Blue Grass ensemble playing on their corner stage.  The place is decorated well, as a western themed place should be, and includes a beautiful long bar.  You go here for the experience -see the band, have a fill of food.  The place is packed with the \"young urban  20's ish been drinking all night needing grease in the am hipster\" type, along with older people, probably from the neighbourhood.   The hostess was way off with an estimated time to sit down, had we known it'd be 30 minutes instead of 10, we would have gone elsewhere.  The food itself is ok. It's made to serve plenty to many quickly. it's half rate at best. The scrambled eggs are ok. The sausages were way too greasy, and chewy. The blueberry pancakes were ok, probably just basic Aunt Jemima.  The place is licensed and from the bar activity several people were ordering Mimosa's or Bloody Caesar's, which I find more common in the U.S.  I tried chatting up the bartender to get a bit of information on the place, but only got attitude - and it turns out she was one of the owner's wives! I would have thought she'd have much more of a friendly disposition. When asking for something from her, we were told it's on the bar, meaning lean over and get it ourselves vs. her passing it over. I really don't get it why people in this city, in the service industry, have such attitude. Without the patrons, you don't have a business, and subsequently, a job. There are no shortage of options in Toronto, one of the great things about this city, so, attention hospitality workers, suck it up. If you can't provide good customer service, with a smile, and \"kill 'em with kindness\", pick another profession!  Overall, I give the Dakota 3 stars and mostly just for the experience. I love live music. And I like the idea of the Bluegrass breakfast, mind you a little Bluegrass goes a long way. But,it was an experience.   I wouldn't go for the food and none of the staff won any kudos.  If you're wrecked from a night of binging and need a lot of low grade grease to fill you up relatively cheap and be surrounded by your peers, then this is the place for you.  If you're looking for a different experience, try Dakota once.  If you want a nice brunch/breakfast with nice service and staff - go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Saw a very good band last Thursday night.  Place is exactly what you would expect for a dive bar/music venue.  But if the band is good you should have a great time.  Would give 3.5 stars. Worth going back if your local.  Will be interesting to see if the band is as good next time."}
{"text":"Came by here for bluegrass brunch. You have to make a reservation or show up early. Great dive bar at night I am sure, but during the day it was too bright and full of kids to appreciate the alter ego.   The brunch is interesting, since they just keep bringing sausage, eggs, fruit salad, and pancakes to the table until you say no. The band was really excellent, and everyone enjoyed it. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Can't say I have ever stayed late enough to eat brunch, but I have immensely enjoyed the dancing and drinking.   Drinks are served by honest, venue accurate bar tenders. Air is remeniscant of a speakeasy(or what i would imagine one would smell like). Kaos insues when the band starts to play Oak floors get stained with spilled Jager and beer. Tacit agreement is \"fun\". Ambitious hedonism is now hard at play---and boy is it ever a kick ass time!"}
{"text":"I had one of the BEST brunch experiences of my life here awhile back. We were wandering the Dundas-Ossington hood slightly hungover, trying to figure out where to plant ourselves for brunch this time. This was a longggg while back, before The Federal and The Guild had opened, when Dundas Street was horribly underserved in the brunch department.  We stumbled into the Dakota and came upon... BLUEGRASS BRUNCH. It. Was. Awesome.  We walked in, and it felt like I was on a farm and my fictional farm mother had just rung the farm brunch bell. We were seated at our picnic table and they promptly brought out large plates with piles of eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, sausages. You know, all that good brunch stuff. Whenever we ran out, they brought over another piping hot plate of what we'd run out of. Plus, there was a live bluegrass show (hence the name, \"Bluegrass Brunch\").  The food wasn't good, but I had such a GREAT time. It's not a place to take your foodie friends, but it's a place to take your fun friends. If those two groups overlap, then hopefully they can forgive the less than stellar food for the super awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was at Dakota Tavern yesterday for their Bluegrass Sunday Brunch. My family was celebrating a delayed Father's Day so we all went together. I'm celiac and vegan so of course I couldn't eat their brunch but with the rest of my family eating their brunch menu I went to be social and participate in our Father's Day celebration. I didn't eat a thing and told the waitress I wasn't eating. When it was time for the bill my mom said it would be minus me because I did not eat, the waitress said that's fine but I would be charged COVER! Excuse me?! Being celiac and vegan I often can't eat at restaurants and I'm okay with that, but I go to socialize with the other people eating (especially for family celebrations). Never in my life have I been charged cover at a restaurant! It's not like I came to listen to the music, took up an entire table, and did not order... I was with an entire table of people who ate! It was also not explained WHY I was being charged cover. (My mom paid the bill across the table and I didn't know this ridiculous cover situation until afterwards or I would have spoken to the manager and not paid it.) This left a horrible taste in my mouth as it wasn't my choice not to eat, I couldn't (however, even if it was my choice I would still be appalled at a cover charge).   On a separate note the staff were all disinterested and never smiled. On the bright side the bathrooms were clean and the band made for good background music."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of The Dakota Tavern.  I don't get there as often as I'd like but when I do it's always a great time.   Sunday and Wednesday nights are the best times to check out live music. The Beauties play on Sundays, and quite often you'll see other popular local musicians hop on stage to play a ditty or two with the band. White Whale Wednesdays offer up a serving of weekly featured While Whale Recording Artists - always a blast.  Don't forget the food! I've yet to try the Blue Grass Brunch (though I really want to) but I've indulged in their mac-n-cheese and let me just say, oh my. It's lovely.   Come for the bands, stay for the mac-n-cheese."}
{"text":"Hands down the best live music venue in Toronto. This is the favourite spot of Canadian rock stars in the city.  Awesome beer and whiskey selection (it shouldn't be any other way with a sign that says \"BEER MUSIC WHISKEY\")  The bands are righteous. You're a big deal if you're playing a Friday or Saturday night and there's a lineup... no way around it.  Toronto's best band (The Beauties) used to play every Sunday night, but that hasn't happened for a while. Who knows if it'll ever happen again (unfortunately). But Sunday nights at the Dakota are a known thing, so these days it's still the best night for live music.  The bluegrass brunch, as everyone says, is great. It's a nice companion to the sweaty, drunken hours of rocking out you delved into the night before. The band is great, and is perfect volume for a hungover, delicious, never-ending brunch. Some might complain about the price, but when you realize that it's factoring in the band, it's a good deal (just imagine $5-$10 off the bill total going to your cover).  Oh... your phone won't always work here, but I like it that way. Put the thing down, and talk to the people around you or focus on the killer band."}
{"text":"3.5 stars but rounding up.  Went for their famous bluegrass brunch. Highlights were the talented band, diversity of the crowd (families, hipsters, babies, etc), and old school tavern setting. Lowlight was the food.  My wife is a vegetarian and all she had were eggs and potatoes for $18/person! I thought they would offer to sub in something for her since it is a fixed price, but they disappointed in that regard.  Even for an omnivore Iike me, I was not very impressed by the bland eggs and potatoes, and cheap sausage that looked like it just came out of a box.  The good music and atmosphere will still bring me back sometime, but if they had more quality food options or better pricing for what they do offer, it would be way more often."}
{"text":"Sometimes food comes secondary when coupled with fantastic music, so not the case at Dakota's. The brunch was filling made almost as good as home and flowing quickly out of the kitchen.   While the food selection was restaurant choice one could hardly complain at the options, fluffy pancakes, copious red pepper-filled scrambled eggs, fresh baked potatoes, sausage and seasonal fruit salad. I might have liked a piece of toast instead and the OJ was atrocious, but the coffee was included and was surprisingly OK.   The music was energetic and alive, filling the bar to the perfect volume. These were definitely longtime musicians who were well honed in their craft.   As opposed to my lovely counterpart I felt that the service was a little frenzied and it took quite a bit to get anyone's attention. We were not in a hurry, so there was no issue. However if you are looking for a quick bite this is probably not the place.   Bottom Line...Brunch was beat-utiful at this bustling bluegrass bistro. So take some time and soak it up."}
{"text":"Le Dakota Tavern est un bar spécialisé dans les concerts live. J'y suis allé pour assister à un concert de musique brésilienne. L'atmosphère y est tout simplement bluffante et en 5 minutes vous vous retrouvez à danser avec vos compagnons de bar. Pas grand chose à dire sur cet établissement : allez y car c'est l'une des perles cachées du quartier d'Ossington!  Dakota Tavern is a bar specialised in live concerts. I went there to see a brazilian band. The atmosphere is just amazing and in 5 minutes you will be dancing with your buddies that you did not know five minutes ago. Not much to say about this place, just go there because it is one of those hidden gems of the Ossington neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Do you digg on blue grass? Do you like a full beer glass? Than perhaps the Dakota Tavern is the joint for you.  I attended the all you can eat style family brunch this past Sunday and it was a really fun experience.  The tavern is exactly that....a tavern. Located on the lower level on Ossington, the Dakota pays homage to classic country bar establishments.  The place is quant, kitsch and fun.  Live blue grass music serenades you as you sit and enjoy home style cooking.  The brunch itself it a large platter of scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, pancakes and fruit salad.  The flavours are fairly basic and not complex at all.  The orange juice reminds me of the frozen sh#t you get out of a can.  The coffee was sub par.  However, the music and the atmosphere were lively and energetic.  There were several young families present and some of the children were up and dancing making my old bones feel lethargic but putting a Sunday smile on my face.  Attending Sunday brunch at the Dakota is a unique experience and I recommend that everyone try it at least once."}
{"text":"I wandered in here one weeknight on my own for a bite to eat, and thumbs up. I sat at the long bar, had a few beers and devoured a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of beans that was a step above. The place really filled up for the band, which I didn't get to hear much of because I was tired and had already downed a few beers. But I definitely want to go back."}
{"text":"Sunday Bluegrass Brunch Showed up at 12 noon.  Food-1* was by far the worst breakfast I've ever eaten. Out of 4 people at our table none of us were happy. Way overpriced for what they actually give you. $18 for bagged scrambled eggs, cheap potato, dried out and soaked in syrup sausage (tasted like they were cooked the day before and sat in a hot pan for 24hrs and the worst fruit salad I had ever seen. The pancakes were okay. $5 extra for baked beans or to add 7 strips of bacon Service-3* Hard to get and they were not that busy.  Band-4* They were great! Which is why they managed to get a 2 star Would any of us go back- not as long as those chefs are cooking. How do you screw up breakfast?"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch. The decor of the place is rustic with lots of wood elements. My friend made reservations for Sat at 10am and it wasn't too busy. The 12pm slots were all full.   I enjoyed the bluegrass band here they were cool, and added to the atmosphere of the place. I wouldn't recommend sitting too close to the band if you really want to talk; as the music can get a bit loud. The band sings well, and it was great to have live music.  Overall the food was good. Not the best breakfast I've had, but good. They serve everything family style. The regular unlimited breakfast is $18. This comes with fresh fruit, pancakes, sausages, scrambled eggs, home fries, tea/coffee. I really enjoyed the home fries; they were delicious you can taste the butter, and the scrambled eggs were soft and fluffy. For $5 more you can get bacon, beans, yogurt, and granola.  If you are looking for a place to grab brunch and enjoy live music I would recommend this place. If you also eat a lot then it's worth it. If you aren't the biggest breakfast eater then this might not be the best place for you."}
{"text":"I went for a show in the middle of the week and the show itself was fantastic. I like the vibe of the place, and the location and its average prices. However, if you have 150 people coming to a space for a show, there should be some sitting space. It was soooo uncomfortable standing around, barely able to see, trying not to hit people. There were tables and chairs, which was lovely for the 50 people sitting, but the rest of us were really struggling. Other than that, I loved it, but that was a serious problem that seemed so easily fixable, and I would like to not feel totally cramped for 2 hours while watching a show, sitting or standing.  As for the bluegrass brunch, I went on a Saturday morning. It was all you can eat, which was nice, because I stuffed myself, but the actual food is pretty mediocre. It's scrambled eggs, sausages and fruit and pancakes. The music is delightful, though, and for all you can eat at $18/pp what's not to like? Totally worth going to for the brunch on a weekend."}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend in Toronto and stopped by The Dakota through word of mouth. I couldn't believe the caliber of the bands that night (saw the Shane Murphy Band) and loved the atmosphere. I've mentioned this place many times since then and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"One of my fav places to see live bands.    It's small, intimate, and you are basically sitting on the stage. It's awesome.   It's loud, can be incredibly crammed at times, but you can always get a drink at the bar, you just have to wait a bit.  The bands are wicked, I love the intimate atmosphere and darkness of this place. I ALWAYS have a great time.   One thing, one of the toilets in the women's bathroom is ALWAYS broken. I dont' know why. It always overflows or something when I've been there (and no, I know what your'e thinking thanks... it's NOT me) ha.  Go check it out when they have live music, you won't regret it.  Never been there for brunch before.. I waited for an hour and bailed. I was starving and couldn't wait although I did get uber tipsy on ceasers waiting which was fun :)"}
{"text":"Dakota Tavern is a charming but small live music venue that serves food.  I went there for their Bluegrass Brunch.  The group performing was very entertaining.  The staff is friendly  and accommodating. The brunch, however, favored quantity over quality.  Admittedly, at $14.00 for all you can eat fruit, scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries and pancakes, perhaps your expectations shouldn't be too high. Nevertheless, without increasing their per serving costs, execution could have been better. Since everything but the fruit is served on a platter at once, it may not be surprising that some of the items arrived less than piping hot. The pancakes (on this day, blueberry) were cool and tough (batter over-beaten in the kitchen?). The sausage was unappetizing and the scrambled eggs (with diced red pepper) were not especially appealing.  The best part of the meal was the home fries.  Bottom line: enjoy the environment and the music, but go with low expectations for the food."}
{"text":"Initially, I wasn't too keen on going out on Friday, but after much persuasion I decided to go to this bar. I played in a volleyball tournament and felt like crap, but after stepping into this place, my energy came back!  Unfortunately I didn't get the name of the band, but they were awesome! If you want to look into it, I was here on Friday Feb 26 and the band played a lot of Rolling Stones' hits. I had a fantastic time at the Dakota Tavern. Alcohol was reasonably price (in Toronto standards) and the general lay out was aesthetically pleasing. The clientele would be considered geared to the 'Hipster' population, but I didn't mind. Basically, I didn't see any dodgy people.  If you like good live music at a small cost of $5, check out the Dakota Tavern. You wont be disappointed. I definitely want to come back here to check out the country music nights."}
{"text":"The Dakota is rad.  There are often great bands playing, there's a good seating-to-non-seating ration, and it's generally awesome.    The food is actually really great.  I have been known to choose their veggie burger over the (real) ones across the street at BQM - they are that good.  Basically, you should come and eat here!  The bluegrass brunch is maybe the most heart-warming event that could ever take place on a Sunday morning.  The food, admittedly, is not so great, but it's family-style all you can eat brunch, so you really can't be too too picky.  Also, it's one of the very few brunch places where it is appropriate to show up with more than four people.  The highlight is sitting at huge communal tables listening to lovely lovely bluegrass bands play.  Toddlers are often dancing around, and because everything is just SO romantic, it basically becomes the cutest thing I've ever seen, every time.  Because the Dakota is in a basement, sometimes it's not ideal for summertime, what with zero potential for natural light.  But, still, always fun.  Another downside is that it has gotten really popular and because of their basementness, they are (rightfully so) very very strict on capacity, which is not too high.  I hate waiting in line, and sometimes you have to wait in line here, and it's coupled with the possibility that you just won't ever get in.    Also, it is really nice that there is a jar of tampons in the women's washroom."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Toronto.  Great staff Great music Great food Great location Great decor Great patrons Great!  I have been here for countless live shows, bluegrass brunches and at least one dinner. I love this venue for music. Even if I've never heard of the band playing, I know it will be good because they are at The Dakota. If you see someone who looks like Feist or Ron Sexsmith, it's probably them. A lot of Canadian musicians hang out here. In fact, last week someone in the audience asked ME if I was Amy Millan from Stars. She probably has been in the crowd there, but I wasn't her.  The bluegrass brunch is fun for groups and the food is really good - if someone has an appetite, they can get thirds! I've seen it done! Kids love dancing to the bluegrass bands too. Fun for the family.  Anyway you slice it, The Dakota is a Toronto classic. See you there!"}
{"text":"This place isn't really my scene but I still had a good time regardless. Went with a group of 3 people. We enjoyed the live music, relaxed atmosphere and good service. The crowd was a bit older and the music that night sounded like Indie/Garage Rock. Good vibes all around with a casual + cozy feeling. It was nice but no one was dancing/rocking out much so we headed to another venue for dancing. Would definitely return again as I'm sure the vibe is different every night. Good to see some local talent and artists for a change."}
{"text":"My friends and I went on a Monday night and without being too crowded the place managed to still feel like the coolest place in Toronto. Loud bluegrass, nice people, best dive bar atmosphere one could ask for."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface with the fact that I am NOT a fan of bluegrass (quite the opposite actually), but I still had a great time.  I came here for brunch with a group of friends. There were over 10 of us and we were able to make reservations, which is a definite plus! What's with all these brunch places not accepting reservations??  As soon as we walked in, we were slapped in the face with the country vibe: rustic wooden tables, exposed brick, fake barn door, everyone in jeans and plaid, etc. It was super cute! There were a lot of family already there and children were running around having a good time. Bluegrass music was playing in the background, but not obnoxiously loud. A live band started playing at noon, and they were really good and complimented the chill atmosphere.  We were immediately greeted by our waitress who was extremely nice and explained to us how the ordering worked. For $18, you get an all-you-can-eat family styled brunch and unlimited coffee/tea. One round would be served for the table, which everyone shared, and you can keep on ordering additional rounds until you're full. The food consisted of pancakes, scrambled eggs, potatoes, breakfast sausages and an assortment of fruit. For an additional $5/plate, you can get extra sides like bacon or baked beans. We thought that was pretty steep and decided to opt out on the sides. None of the dishes were particularly fancy, but were very hearty. My group made it through two rounds before calling quits.  Overall, I wasn't particularly wowed by the quality of the food (it truly felt like something your family could cook up at home), but for the atmosphere and live entertainment, it was well worth the $18. I would definitely recommend you give Dakota Tavern a try, especially if you're a country/bluegrass fan."}
{"text":"THE BEST BLUES BAR IN TORONTO.  I'm reticent to write glowingly and advertise this joint because me and my pals like the fact that it's a hidden gem. However, it is my duty as locally loyal Yelp-Man to tell it like it is..  This place is great! I didn't even know I liked the blues, but you will be a believer. Right from your curious walk downstairs to the bar, the dim light and booze-soaked wooden planked floor catapult your senses to another time and place. Perhaps a sleazy joint on the original Bourbon Street, or a cowboy bar in the Wild West.. Order a Labatt 50 and a shot of Jack for you and the bartender and complete your cathartic blues experience.  The house band (can't remember name)  is authentic and well-balanced; they play on SUNDAY'S- check them out. Also 'The Done Me Wrongs' got their bluesy feet wet here and now they tour all over the place- catch them here if you can. One time I popped in after seeing Modest Mouse at The Molson Amphitheatre and in walked the guitar player! And yes, he got up and joined the house band.  Out-Of-Towners Most Welcome! See the really cool Toronto. Come to The Dakota.  PS- Make plans and stick with them because there's no cell reception inside The Dakota.."}
{"text":"Came here for their Saturday morning Bluegrass brunch special and was pleasantly surprised. All you can eat breakfast with a live bluegrass band playing was fun. The food was nothing original, your basic breakfast fare but it made it up in droves with the atmosphere."}
{"text":"One my favourite brunches in the city is at The Dakota. The bluegrass review sets the tone. I've been lucky to have come during busy and not busy times. I will say, the eggs do taste better after you've been waiting in line for a long time. But the coffee is really good. And so are the sausages. I don't eat pancakes and despite being billed as buttermilk, I found them light. I do love the family style serving.  The service is alright. I think they know they have a good thing. The last time I was there was a comedy of errors. I was playing city guide to a friend and I completely forgot how this brunch works! Thankfully, everyone had a good laugh."}
{"text":"For someone who is totally not into country music (even the hipster variety that borderlines rock) I've had a great time in the handful of appearances I've made at the Dakota. I like the fact that there seems to be zero attitude in this place --from the bouncers to the bartenders.  The vibe is pretty electric most times. People are there to have a good time and consume mass amounts of alcohol. And I have to admit that even though I am not really into the music, the bands they have play here are pretty incredible. With the basement location and low ceilings the music rings off the walls and, quite literally, rocks.  Last time I came here was on a Sunday and I was shocked that the place was rammed. There's not many Sunday locations you can say that about. Someone told me the house band always packs them in, and I can see why. They were indeed quite good. Again, this coming from a guy who listens to hip-hop all the time."}
{"text":"My review is based on the atmosphere, the bartenders and music (bands) and not their much talked about bluegrass brunch (which I haven't gone to cause I like my brunch one on one and not at a communal table).   These guys chose their bands well so even if you've not heard of that given night's act, you're sure to enjoy it. It's not been too difficult to get me off the bar stool and bust a move! Now I'm not so much for hard drinks or fancy ones, more a beer guy, but the the bar is run well.   So bring your favorite company and go! Pay the $5 or $10 cover (band), cause you'll dig the vibe. Is there still no phone reception there? Oh yes, The Dakota is lower level, or basement if you will."}
{"text":"Disappointment had to rear its head at some point. I tried the mint julep. If you like ice, you'll love the mint julep. A large fountain cup (unusual for a julep but whatever), a decent shot (meh), a bunch of fresh mint (good), the large cup filled with ice to the degree that we had to pour some out to get at the bourbon.   Dude, really? Really? I mean, really? Sigh.  Stick with the beer I guess.   Damn you LCBO but a stern wag of the finger at you Dakota."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places hands down.   Not only have I enjoyed many fun-filled evenings with friends downing a 50 but this joint is also reminiscent of my parents' basement circa 1978.   Once you walk downstairs the feeling you experience is a very welcoming one. On a certain night when a band plays, it can get pretty busy but on regular nights, you can find a place to sit at the bar or at one of the tables. And if it's packed, who cares. It's easy to randomly meet people and strike up a conversation while sipping Labatt 50 and Wild Turkey.   Since its opening, I've seen many great local and national bands perform, and as a live music photographer, I'm a fan of the Christmas lights used for lighting the stage, providing a nice ambient glow.    Their Sunday brunches are very popular so do come early. If you're in the mood to get to know your neighbours, try to find a spot at the large communal table. You'll enjoy no-nonsense homestyle cooking while listening to the bluegrass band offered as entertainment."}
{"text":"Half-way through a gruelling concert tour I was \"dragged\" here by the drummer in the band saying we need to escape our gig for something completely different.  After schlepping our kit off the tour-bus we made our way up here only to discover a queue.  The drummer being the good Englishman suggested we queue up or go for something to eat nearby.  Which we did.  After our respite we came back only to discover that queue hadn't been quashed.  So I succumbed and stood in line.  The drummer being 15+ years my junior suggested it \"was the proper thing to do\".  Standing in line however goes against every fibre of my being.  I'm usually the one walking in the back-alley door through the kitchen because our next set is up in 5 minutes.  Eventually we got in half-way through the last set (for the Sunday Band).  The drunken set where they turn up the volume to max.  Thankfully I always carry my protection wherever I go!  My etymotic musicians' ear-plugs rendered the volume to a sane and non-career threatening level.  We stood near the back trying to fit in by taking crappy flash cell phone pictures to post on Facebook.  (Trying to be cleverly ironic mocking the hipsters who do this thinking it's cool)  Alas, the pictures were CRAP!  (But that was the point)  Will they ever see the light of day?  Who knows.  They are trapped on the drummer's cell phone somewhere in South London (UK).  The bar was well stocked and had my favourite medicine.  The Sunday band played well... well enough to make me think I might just try to hear the first set with a meal before the hipsters queue up."}
{"text":"Dear Yelpers, be forgiving with your first impression with the Dakota.    Yeah, it smells gross.   Yes, it's dark.    Looking from the outside, you wonder, \"I don't want to go in there!\"  But once you're in, you can't leave!  Come out on Sunday for their 'Bluegrass Lunch', served family-styled as an all-you-can-eat buffet at $14 a head (children pay $7).  The waitresses will bring you as many plates of fruit - blueberries, oranges, pineapples - pancakes, scrambled eggs, sausages and fried potatoes to your delight.  All the while, you are munchie your post-hangover breakie, scarfing it with gusto as you tap your feet to a live bluegrass!!    Great for groups, not so hot for vegans."}
{"text":"Came here for the bluegrass brunch and loved it. The experience was really unique and I will be encouraging friends to check it out.  Other yelp reviews made the food sound terrible so I was pleasantly surprised when it was comparable to food you would get at a diner. If you're looking for more upscale breakfast food, there are plenty of other places nearby for you to check out.  The music was great too! I felt guilty chatting with my table because the band was so talented and probably deserved more of my attention.  For $14 you get decent all-you-can-eat food and a concert. Unbeatable!"}
{"text":"Headed here on a date night, after Khao San Road(which was, as expected, good but nothing special). The cover was $10. The place was completely packed, and had an electric atmosphere. The country music bands that played were amazing, and had the crowd groovin to their tunes. Pretty sure my date and I were the youngest ones here, and we were the only 20-somethings but we had a fantastic time, regardless. Definitely a spot you want to hit up regularly if you want to have a good time. The only downside is that the music is so loud that it makes conversation difficult. The place has a fantastic vibe."}
{"text":"If you're feeling a low key night, with some awesome live music and cheap beers, you can't go wrong with the Dakota. It's style is rustic and old school and their food is decent and cheap. All you can eat brunch on the weekend too, but you really need to line up early for that."}
{"text":"Bluegrass Brunch on Sundays.  This was a blast - usually I wouldn't go anywhere that had a set menu but this was great and super fun.  It's $14 per adult and comes with coffee, OJ, scrambled eggs, fruit, sausage, hashbrowns and pancakes.  They bring the food to the table on family style platters and when you want more of something you just tell them and they bring you more.  It's pretty fantastic, because I hate buffets but this was like the best of both worlds.  Caesars ans mimosas are $6 and my mimosa was mostly sparkling wine with just a splash of OJ (fine by me).    The good: - The music was awesome.  The band has a single condenser mic that they all sang into together while they played banjo, upright bass and fiddle.  It was the perfect volume - pretty loud but we could still talk without shouting. - There were a lot of children here and it was the only setting where children don't annoy me.  They were all in good spirits (probably because it was early in the morning... welll... maybe 11am isn't early for them...); none of the children cried and the parents that were here were good at wrangling them when appropriate.  It was super cute when there were 5 little kids up dancing in front of the stage and it made me briefly reevaluate my hatred of children in eateries.  Briefly.  Anyways, kudos to the families who were there this morning because I usually hate children, but not yours today, so that's pretty special. - The food is unlimited for $14.  Probably not the best value for me & Danielle, because I doubt we ate even close to $14 worth of food, but if you had a table of hungry young men this would be a place to take them. - This place is actually good for groups - if you arrive early.  You basically need to get in line at 1040ish and be one of the first people in the door when it opens at 1100 and you could bring 10 people if you wanted.  If you came after that though... you would have to wait.  But, you would get served coffee while you wait. - Our server was serving a LOT of tables but she was very efficient and cool.  When we asked for more pancakes, they came out right away and we also got the bill right away when we were ready to go. - Food was pretty good considering they were cranking out platter after platter of it for the packed house.  Scrambled eggs were good (usually not my favorite item), pancakes were excellent and the hashbrowns were serviceable.  The fresh fruit was particularly well done with huge platters of oranges, watermelon, miscellaneous melons and grapes coming out super clean.  The bad: - The orange juice was horrible.  It was SUPER watered down concentrated OJ. It was possibly the worst orange juice I have ever had, rivaling mcDonalds 'orange drink' for that title.   - Everything else was awesome, I have no complaints!  Would I come here again? Yes!   A few notes on coming here again though: 1. You have to arrive at 1045 to get a table when it opens at 11. 2. The sausage does touch the other food, so if you are a super-vegetarian and you won't eat food that comes on the same plate as meat, you shouldn't come to this.  Or you should come to this and be prepared to pay $14 to eat only fruit and enjoy the fantastic bluegrass (which is still worth $14.)"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. We went for bingo night, I was lured in by the advertised Chicken and Waffles. I really wish we had something like this bar here in Cleveland. Set up like an old stagecoach with whiskey barrel bar stools, a stage, and some very friendly bartenders, this bar was really cool. And there was a cowboy announcer!  They had some pretty awesome happy hour specials (I think it was something along the lines of a $3 beer and $3 ginger and rye, which is the way to my irish heart), we split the chicken and waffles. Pretty standard, $12 for two pieces of chicken, two waffles, and a fruit compote. My memory's a little fuzzy but there was this awesome hot sauce...   Bingo was $5, and even though we didn't win, it was a blast. Everyone was so friendly and engaging. This is my kind of bar."}
{"text":"I came here to try their Bluegrass Brunch this past weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Bluegrass is definitely not typically my cup of tea, but it created a lovely atmosphere and who the heck doesn't like $14 all-you-can-eat brunch??   The food is served family style and it's surprisingly tasty.  You get fruit, scrambled eggs with red peppers, blueberry pancakes (!!!), sausages, potatoes, juice and coffee.  Strapping on the feed bag at the Dakota Tavern is the perfect way to cure a nasty hangover!    I would describe the service as leisurely, so I wouldn't suggest coming here if you're in a hurry. That being said, the staff was very friendly and welcoming and I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"This dark little honky tonk bar is my favourite place to go for great live country music and a few pints on late weekday nights. There's always a different and often local act on each night which you usually can't check out on MySpace first. If you love country music and trust me or are looking to do something different, just show up and let yourself be immersed in the knee-slapping, toe-wiggling tunes first hand. You won't regret it!   Both fortunately (for me and a few other weekday devotees) and unfortunately (for those of you who have been missing out), the Dakota on weeknights is still a very well kept secret. Last Tuesday, there were only about ten scattered people in the audience, sitting around the tables and lined up against the long bar. Meanwhile, the band on stage grew to seven passionate musicians by the end of the night (including, to our surprise, our friendly bartender who jumped on stage to collaborate on a few songs). Like many other bands I've been lucky enough to catch on similarly quiet nights, it was evident that they were having a great time just playing together. Despite the very mixed crowds, this truly awesome and lively energy manages to fill the air more often than not and it's nothing but camaraderie and good times between everyone there.   Regardless of whether there are ten laid back regulars there on a Monday at 9pm or a crowd of ten rowdy birthday parties there on a Saturday at 2am though, you can usually chat up the bands during breaks in their sets or even buy them a pint after the show. They deserve it since there is usually no or only a pay-what-you-can cover charge at the door (on weeknights, anyways).   The beers are reasonably priced ($5-7) and there are a few mostly domestic trusty ones to choose from on tap. I've heard good things about the Sunday Bluegrass Brunch too, but it can get extremely crowded (to the point that you'll be turned away or have to wait really long), so I'll stick to my intimate weekday night shows - for now at least."}
{"text":"Musty beer and shitty music.  Decent room, good sound guy.  Why did they design the bar in such a way that you cannot sit at it without a massive man-spread?"}
{"text":"I've always been curious about the Dakota because there's always a line out the door on weekends.  We decided to check it out on a Thursday night to see a friends' band.    Front door staff were nice even thought there was a slight mix up with the guest list.  The space itself is in the basement, long and narrow.  The stage is small but intimate.    The kitchen was still open but we had already eaten.  Would love to come back and check out the Bluegrass Brunch."}
{"text":"The Dakota Tavern knows how to have a good ol' time! Of all the bars near Ossington and Dundas, this place ranks the top for live music. It's really a country bar for hipsters, located in a rustic basement. Apparently they also serve Southern-style pub fare on weekends. For Instagram photos and to check out the vibe of this one of a kind tavern in Toronto, check it out here: http://thedakotatavern.com/photos/  Service was quick, music was loud, and the place was full of people.   Pro tip 1: For live music, Cover is $10. For shows, check out their website: http://thedakotatavern.com/cover/ -Be careful walking down - or up - those stairs!-  Pro tip 1: Bluegrass Brunch is 10 a:m - 2 p:m Saturday & Sunday, which is ALL YOU CAN EAT (in Toronto!!!):  $18 per adult, $7 per child, you get:  Scrambled eggs Sausages Pancakes Potatoes Fruit salad Coffee/tea  Sides $5 each Baked beans Bacon Plain yogurt and granola  From the bar: Orange juice $3 Classic caesars $7 Mimosa $7 Beau's $5 Beau Jay $6.50  Pro tip 2: reservations are taken for groups over 6 on Saturdays.

{"text":"this place is well known for its bands that occasionally come through. its hidden in a basement on the northside of the lively ossington strip. the food is def above average with really well made salads and decent tacos. infact i would give their salad menu 4/5 . The service is very quick and friendly. Its one of those places where the staff are really happy to see you."}
{"text":"CHRISTMAS LIGHTS INDOOR ALL YEAR ROUND ALERT! I walked in on a busy Sunday night and immediately wanted to do a jig! The Beauties were playing and far surpassed my expectations for the $5 cover we paid. We grabbed a seat at the bar and ran into some old friends (which is always fun).  I traded my cider for a bottle of Strawberry Fruli and one of the best Whisky Sours I've had in a long long time.  This place packs up pretty early (even on a Sunday), so if you are looking for a seat try getting there before 11pm. Don't worry the Beauties play 3 sets from 10pm to 1am!  Honestly, the only thing stopping me from giving this place 5 stars is because someone stole my chapters bag with three books I had just bought :-(  WHO STEALS BOOKS?! Sometimes I swear... *lowers her head in shame for humanity*"}
{"text":"I've always had a great time when I've come here. The bands they bring in are always great, though it can be quite loud due to the small space that is The Dakota.  The staff are always on the ball and generally remember you once you've hit the bar for your second round.  My only complaint is that the building is like a bomb shelter. You don't get any cell service unless you're standing by the stairs."}
{"text":"Whether I'm ending a night with shots at the bar bathed in the glow of strings of light, or showing up for Bluegrass Brunch to recover from a night out (what's better than kids dancing, music blaring, and family-style platters of scrambled eggs to make the memories of the night before even fuzzier?)...The Dakota never lets me down.    5 stars, a \"yahoo!\", and a southern yodel for this joint on Ossington.  If I have out-of-towners visiting, they come with me to The Dakota.  Which is funny, I suppose, because I often yell to my fellow Torontonians above the music \"this place feels like it's not even in Toronto!\".  It's loud, it's a good mix of people, I don't feel a pretentious vibe (I've shown up dressed up in work clothes, post-bar crawl and in clothes just slightly more dressy than PJs, and all felt a-ok), and the music is killer.  Special musical note goes out to Bluegrass Brunch regulars The Beauties and the annual winter holiday event, \"Jason Collett's Basement Revue\".  Your ears will leave happy.  Trust.  Staff great, Caesars stiff, vibe phenomenal, and food, though not top notch, well...you're not *really* at The Dakota for the food.    Yelp note: The Dakota is in the basement of a building, which can make connecting with friends hard (phone service, you say?).  However, this tech-luddite can admit (we're all friends here, right?) that I kindof find that charming.  I show up, rally with my friends who are there, and the rest of the world beyond The Dakota is dead to me (telephonically, that is).  BOO to the YAHS."}
{"text":"To be honest, I don't remember how or why my friends and I stumbled into the Dakota Tavern one Monday evening. What I do remember is that 4 out of 6 of us happened to be wearing plaid (how obnoxious!) and we were slightly intoxicated....  While our entrance may have gotten us a few glances from the older ones in the crowd, we brushed it off and grabbed some beer and a seat close to the stage. There was live music and the place was fairly busy with a bunch of different types. I love places where the crowd is indistinguishable.   This is a feel good place if you just want a fun night of drinking and kicking back with some friends. You can enjoy the music, tap your feet, mingle with the crowd, and not have to worry about anything.   I've also heard great things about their brunch but haven't had a chance to go yet, I'll update this when I do :)"}
{"text":"Crazy about their bluegrass brunch.  I love live music but had never consider pairing it with brunch - it works!  The band is a lot of fun, the food is simple but very good and the country motif works well.    The food comes out family style and is never ending.  I love that you can have endless bowls of fruit.  Of course if you prefer never ending eggs and sausage that is an option as well.    Over all the food is like you would have at a friend or family's house for brunch which is a welcome change.  The music however is what makes the experience."}
{"text":"Came here today, for their Sat/Sun brunch.    The music was good, regardless of whether you normally listen to bluegrass or not. Hearing a live band play was a treat.    Street parking in the area, is also decent.  ~~~ However, the reason I'm giving DT only two stars is because:  -$18 is steep for the kind of food they're offering.  Poor value.  Even though it's all you can eat, I wouldn't be partaking in their sausage, and wasn't keen on having their scrambled eggs.  I can sometimes be a picky eater, plus I'm a vegetarian (and mostly? a foodie), so this place did not satisfy.  The fruit salad looked pretty good however, and their pancakes looked okay.  Just not $18 okay.  From other Yelpers, looks like it was $14 not too long ago.    -I went with my toddler.  Sure the live band masks any noise a toddler can make, but it was really quite loud.  I asked my little one if it was time to leave, and my toddler readily agreed. Also, the server didn't seem to know how to work with toddlers - didn't bother offering a booster or high chair.  Space seemed tight, and it was kind of busy, but still parents with toddler will always appreciate if the server offers any special accommodations for  little ones.  -found out that there is a mandatory $7 if anyone is in the party, but who doesn't eat any of the food.  We presumed the money was to help cover the band.    ~~  I left with the impression that this place is okay at most.  For me.  Not too long ago, I was at \"School\" in Liberty village. A la carte Fun and varied brunch options, also very trendy and foodie-friendly.   I'd rather eat there, than at DT again."}
{"text":"After reading a few of the reviews here, I'm almost tempted to go back to the Dakota to check out the food. I've never eaten there; but I probably never will because I'm very unlikely to come back for the entertainment.   The Dakota combines awful acoustics with an incompetent and overly loud mix. It is brutal and unpleasant even when you like the band. It's too bad really - they seem to bring some good talent through the doors."}
{"text":"My all time favourite music venue in Toronto.  I love the decor, it's really fitting and the music is always very good (though I do pick who I go see -- so I usually know it's going be to good.)   The beer is great and the atmosphere is fantastic! I've had many great memories. I don't think I've ever come here and not had a good time. One time there was even square dancing! I also like how it's not full of women wearing practically nothing and men gawking at these women. Everyone is dressed (usually) modestly and not worried about making a fool of themselves out on the dance floor!   If you're looking for a grand ol' time, The Dakota is the spot for you."}
{"text":"A blast - usually I wouldn't go anywhere but this was super fun.  It's a few bucks per adult and comes with coffee, OJ, scrambled eggs, fruit, sausage, hashbrowns and pancakes.  They bring the food that's style platters and when you want more of something you just tell them and they bring you more.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"Fun little bar for some country music!!! I would definitely go back.   The only eek is $10 cover. I hope that goes towards the bands...."}
