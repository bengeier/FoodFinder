{"text":"Great food and fun atmosphere! The loud Italian workers crack me up. The whole experience feels authentic. Reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Gotta love this restaurant ! Been going there since 1995. When you go there, make sure you talk to Olympia the owner. Ask.her all about her favorite vacation spot, Amalfi Italy. All the recipes are from her home country Italy transported to America The atmosphere is very simple but the food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Fantastic New York-style pizza but it doesn't end there.  This little neighborhood gem provides a casual and relaxed atmosphere and friendly service from the owners and staff.  We have been going there for years and certainly have our favorites including the fried calamari, penne all'arabbiatta, chicken scaloppine al vino bianco and tiramisu.  And the fresh baked bread served with dinner is wonderful.  Amalfi is also a great lunch spot but sadly, I don't work close enough to the University area to do that.  The pizza is top notch and this displaced New Yorker has been getting his pizza fix at Amafi for over 15 years now.  The stromboli and calzone are also good.  Don't overlook the homemade soups.  If Olympia ever teaches a class on making soup, I'm in.  Great, fun and authentic neighborhood Italian place that's great for the family."}
{"text":"I will say that I was not really expecting much from this place, but my girlfriend wanted to go to a close Italian place, so I picked this one.  Much better than expected.  Decor was average for a mid-priced Italian restaurant.  Service was OK, though not great.  But they made up for it with the food.  I had never had a calzone (many strombolis, but no calzones).  Got one with artichoke, and it was perfect.  Puffy, with just the perfect amount of ricotta, mozz and artichokes, with a side of marinara that, while not mindblowing, was very good.   GIrlfriend enjoyed the Fett Alfredo she got.  The price of hers was typical for this sort of place (overpriced in my mind, but still typical).  Mine was super cheap, especially for dinner.   If I remember correctly, they only had bottled beer.  Vegetarian friendly.  Not bad at all  :)"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! I spent 15 minutes on the phone with a man trying to get a phone number so that I could order delivery from this place. Why do I need to call a restaurant to get a phone number to order food from the SAME PLACE? The number that he gave me doesn't even work, it's some poor woman's cell phone who said she gets calls all the time for this place. I don't care how good their food may be, I'm not spending my money on a place that makes you jump through hoops just to get food and has no idea what customer service means."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today. I love Italian food especially Chicken Picatta.  I have to say. It was the best Chicken Piccata and side of Pasta with tomato sauce I have ever had. I cook Italian myself and have tried a lot of the areas Italian resturants. Portofino's  has always been my favorite but this place was even better. It was incredible."}
{"text":"The small salad needs more vegetables. It is only $ 2.25 but they had one tomato. The balsamic vinegar was too strong.  Margarita pizza had a soggy crust.  Would definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Great locally-owned, family run restaurant. Used to go here back in undergrad, returned back a week ago for lunch.. still the same great food. GET THE LUNCH SPECIAL! What a deal!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it has taken me so long to write about Amalfi's!  I really love this restaurant for lunch.  Don't be put off by its strip mall location.  The food is great and the lunch specials can't be beat.    I typically go to Amalfi's for lunch, and they have a great selection of lunch specials, along with the regular full menu and daily specials. So, my favorie lunch is the stuffed shells.  The special includes hot, fresh bread, salad and 2 yummy baked stuffed shells covered in melted cheese, fresh from the oven.  All for about $6!  It is the perfect amount for lunch.  You can't beat it."}
{"text":"When I use to be in the university I would love getting pizza from here, I still stop in on occasion definitely one of my favorite pizzas"}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite pizza place to go.  Funny as it sounds, my wife and I very rarely get pizza and settle for some delicious veal marsala or the penne amalfitana.    The prices are very reasonable compared to the quality of ingredients and care in putting the dishes together.  The owners are also very friendly and make every effort to come to your table to make sure you are satisfied and happy.    We have been making Amalfi our go-to restaurant for the last 13 years.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good italian pasta.  Service good.  Kind of a small place tucked into a strip mall.  Will definately come back if in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Amalfi provides a nice combination of excellent Italian cuisine with a casual dining experience.  The atmosphere is personal and friendly, with the owner regularly conversing with his customers.  Their prices are also very reasonable, especially for the quality (and quantity) of their meals.  From their pastas to their pizza, they do Italian right!"}
{"text":"Damn I miss this place.... I was turned on to this restaurant by a coworker when I lived in Kannapolis, and found myself eating here at least three times a week.. The owners, Mike and his wife, treated my family as if we were part of his own.... Always a good experience... You can't go wrong with any of the meals there.... The pizzas and calzones are remarkably great.... And the entrees are equally good... My favorites here are the chicken parm, fettucini alfredo, and linguini with clams.. Whenever we're travelling South, we always get off at the University Exit to stop at Amalfi's for a meal... I hate driving on vacation, but stopping here is a good enough reason to drive..."}
{"text":"My family (5 of us) went here simply because it was located close to my son's home and we did see some decent reviews on this restaurant.. Simply put, for the money and casual environment, one of the best places to drop in, be treated like FAMILY and walk out fully nourished on excellent Italian food. In spite of being on the other side of town from us, we WILL certainly make every effort to return whenever we want to dine with the owners, Olympia & Mike! They are like the Italian parents you never had! Go, enjoy and be happy!  Respectfully submitted,  -dk"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and the service was good. I had the lunch special of tuna and shrimp with penne in a wine sauce. It also came with a salad and bread. The taste was OK, but I wouldn't order it again. I also didn't like that my plate had only one small shrimp. I will probably visit again and try another dish."}
{"text":"Food was incredible as well as the service. Very nice homey restaurant. Definitely would come back. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We have eaten there many times and I love the service (Linda); you have to be in New York frame of mind.... Give it back to her to make her smile!   The food is always better than expected. It has become a great comforter zone.  Try the pasta with eggplant.... ... penne amalfitana. Fabulous. Pizza is good as well."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here a handful of times, but thus far it has always made for an enjoyable dinner. The first time we ever went, we ordered the Capellini Sorrento, spaghetti with tomato sauce with a side of meatballs and two custom slices of pizza all for $34! Their prices are reasonable for the large portions served.  Their garlic knots are super yummy; Their pizza is always very well done with fresh ingredients and a nice crust; Their meatballs had a nice flavor and weren't small and their spaghetti sauce has a nice flavor as well! The Capellini Sorrento (angel hair pasta with shrimp and scallops in a creamy pesto sauce) was a nice hefty helping of pasta with just the right balance of seafood mixed in and tasted good. We've tried a few other items off the menu, including their tortellinis and other various pasta dishes and thus far have zero complaints! Everything is cooked well, and tastes good!  I think my favorite thing about this restaurant is that they have a good sized children's menu with a variety of foods which is wonderful if you have a picky eater or one that enjoys trying new things or eating what the adults eat but in smaller portion form. The majority of their prices are reasonable for the larger portions you're served, so all I can say is dig in! We look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Sanitation grade is 95.  The worn hallway carpet was soaked in what I hope was water. The back door was standing open and there was no screen door. Our server was having her lunch out in the dining room that was brought in from Harris teeter."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Pizza was ok. Needed more sauce, and was bland. Garlic knots were good."}
{"text":"Pizza was great.  The original style crust was the perfect amount of crisp and chewy.  It reminded me of pizza I've had at some of the best pizza spots in NYC.  All of the ingredients were fresh and the sauce was tasty.  The sauce had good flavor and it wasn't too sweet.  There was also a perfect amount of it.  It was dang tasty but not the best pizza I ever had so only 4 stars.  The staff were also very friendly and welcoming.  I was treated like a \"regular\" but it was my first time there.  If I lived in the area, I would go there all the time because I have a feeling all of the food is great and made with the same care."}
{"text":"Best Italian! It's our go-to spot when Friends from out of town visit.  Our New York friends love it!  Lasagna is to die for!"}
{"text":"This is not the best italian food in the world or even in Charlotte, but it is good unpretentious Italian food by Italians. If you go in with that in mind you will not be disappointed. I have been going since they opened in 93? and have enjoyed every visit."}
{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant for a simple lunch or dinner. Flavors are good, service is OK and quick but this is not an upscale restaurant it is instead a neighborhood place that is OK. If you are a student or professor at UNC Charlotte it is one of the better places for lunch in the area."}
{"text":"Have been a few times with a friend.  Food Is always delicious.  I get the veal with caper sauce.  He always gets pizza. However,  the waitress there is extremely rude and pushy. She took the menu out my hand as I was still reading although I finished ordering.  She didn't ask,  she just politely snatched it.  It's the same waitress everytime we go,  and she is always miserably the same way.  The owner is great as well as the food. The waitress is that funny bitter after taste to the experience.  She must be family as to why she gets away with this grungy disposition she carries."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Charlotte. Sadly owned by Yankee fans (said the Mets fan) who brought NY pizza and desserts down south with them. The owners are a lot of fun to have conversations with. I always make sure to get an order of cannoli because they are the closest I've found to the ones I used to get on Long Island."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in University Area.  Very authentic and down home atmosphere. Owners are very friendly.  The calzones and pasta I tried are delicious as well."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly servers! I got the Veal Marsala, and it was the perfect amount of richness. Between the three of us, we all loved our food. Only con: The wait was a bit long. But it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to write a negative review, but I am simply baffled by all of the positive reviews this place has received. My girlfriend and I ate here for dinner and expected the food to be edible at the very least. This was not simply a matter of it being an \"off night\" - it was clear from the start that the quality of ingredients was well below what  one would expect from a low grade cafeteria. The \"house balsamic\" served over iceberg was watery and flavorless. The bread tasted like cardboard. Her Penne Arrabiata was coated in a less than generous portion of bland sauce and the pasta was overcooked. My eggplant parmesan sandwich (The Favorito) was not only foul tasting, but down right bizarre - like eating the fried skin of some weird alien, not even distantly reminiscent of what i know as eggplant, served on the same crappy bread. Somehow our waitress could not comprehend that we did not want boxes. We left with full plates, empty pockets and emptier stomaches."}
{"text":"We had the Margarita Pizza and a salad.  One word.. Legit!!!  The owner was a hoot as well.  He came around with his \"Sponge Bob\" candy dispenser flirting with all the moms.  I will be back."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing and the staff is very kind. This location is a bit small but such is generally the case with family-owned restaurants. The Italian dishes they offer are clearly made fresh and were served to our party fresh from the oven. I would give 5-stars but the wine list is quite short for an Italian restaurant with such an extensive list of entrees and I prefer to pair my Italian food with a glass of wine. Overall, I highly recommend dining here!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Weekend specials are always delish, especially the saltimbocca. Best tiramisu I've ever had, hands down."}
{"text":"I just had the WORST experience here at Amalfi's.  Our waitress was absolutely AWFUL - she acted like we were a burden and we were the ONLY people in the joint!  She was extremely curt, rude and majorly unhappy with her job and had no interest in being a decent waitress at all.  The owners really need to fire her.  It seemed to be family night - as in the family that ran the place was there - and they were only interested in watching the NASCAR race on tv.  We ordered salad and got a watery, disjointed handful of greens thrown on a plate.  I waited til my pizza came to tell the waitress about the awful salad, because I was afraid she would do something to my food.  I told her it was all watery (literally, there was water all in the plate) and instead of saying something like \"oh I'm so sorry\", she actually told me that yes, it was watery because it was \"fresh and from the garden.\"  Yes, that was what she said.  So my pizza was burnt on the bottom and had virtually no sauce - it was one of the worst pizzas I've ever had.  And this place was like a sitcom... other people came in that seemed to be friends with the staff and owners and they all had bizarre interactions with each other... the owners yelled at the waitress a lot, who kept going outside and sitting on the bench...  when our pizza was done, the cook put it on the counter and slammed his pizza cutter down and yelled at the owners to go get the waitress, who was outside again... the owners were yelling at the cook at some point later...  I was still eating my pizza - actually EATING the pizza - and the waitress came over and asked if I wanted a box for the three pieces that were left on the platter, and I said no, and then she asked me if I was done.  I stopped EATING to say NO, I'M STILL EATING.  Ugh, what a nightmare this place was.  Horrible.  Stay away.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Love this pie! Wifey and I ate lunch here three days in a row... She's obsessed with great pizza. Two slices and a drink for each of us runs super cheap. Gotta get back and try the pasta dishes."}
{"text":"We were running some errands in the University area and decided to get dinner. Once again, we let the web guide us and this place seemed to be well-liked.   We decided to sit outside, and that immediately caused a bit of an issue - the chairs are chained to the tables and it results in a somewhat awkward and uncomfortable seating position. Strange, and they never offered to unchain them for us.  Service was fast, polite and responsive. The menu seemed to be what one would expect from an Italian place. We started with the garlic knots - pizza dough with herbs and a marinara sauce. The knots themselves were tasty, but the marinara was a bit on the runny side. The bread that came with the meal was spectacular. We realize now that we should have ordered sandwiches. They're bound to be good on that bread.  We did not. We ordered chicken-stuffed shells and the fettuccine with ham, pancetta, mushrooms and peas. The shells came on a plate straight out of the pizza oven. My wife found the portion to be generous, but the dish was too salty. The fettuccine was perfectly al dente to me, but the sauce had broken, leaving oil/fat at the bottom of the bowl. Still tasty, but not ideal.  If we make it back, we'll be trying the sandwiches just to get more of that bread."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!!!! I am from NJ, and it is so hard to find good pizza in NC. This place has the best pizza, pasta, and bread. I love the owner he is an Italian man who often times teaches Italian to you as you order. It's the best by far."}
{"text":"We love Amalfi's pizza.  I can't speak to any other items on the menu, as the whole reason we go is for the pizza.  We're from up North and the pizza is killer.  My husband used to work up near the restaurant, but now we drive up there just for a treat!  The owners are fabulous, waitstaff is interesting (I think we usually get his daughter).  Not sure I've ever seen her smile, lol"}
{"text":"This place has been around for a while and they treat you like family.  Eating here is like eating with family. Our waiter was the son of the owners and he told us the photos around the restaurant were his daughters. They have loyal customers who have been going here for years. They have a great menu with not just pizza but various Italian dishes that range from sandwiches to pasta dishes. I had a seafood pizza sorry don't remember the actual name but it had shrimp calamari and scallops with ricotta mozzarella and garlic sauces how can you go wrong. The next time I go I definitely will try a pasta dish."}
{"text":"I really liked this place!   Would never expect good food like this to be tucked away in a strip mall, but then again, in Charlotte, thats where I seem to be finding some of the best.  I can only speak about the pizza, as that was all I tried. But it was incredible!! Crust was nice and thin, yet still has a nice chew to it. This is real NY style pizza. Can't wait to go back and try everything else they have. And from reading other reviews it seems I will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza outside of NYC.  Nice little place in a strip mall.  People are friendly.  Great food."}
{"text":"The meatballs are like little pillows of beef. Great food, great service. Great prices. Will return often. My only complaint is that I live so far away."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!! The food was so delicious and we had such an amazing time!! The family that owns Amalfi's are such sweet and welcoming people!! We can't wait to go back the 40min drive is MOST definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service. Been going for years and never a complaint about the quality of food or service. The owners greet you, play with your kids, treat your kids, and gladly accommodate you. Never rude how some reviews claim, it's just how they are... Get ovaaaaa it!! Will always be a customer of theirs as long as they are in business."}
{"text":"A nice local family restaurant that makes you feel right at home. We were greeted quickly by Alex and he gave us some time to go over the menu. Very traditional Italian Cuisine so you will need time to make a decision. I went with Fettuccini Alfredo with Shrimp and it was hearty and filling. Nice selection of local beers, wine and soft drinks. One of the owners came to out table after noticing my NY Yankees hat and we had a fun conversation. If you're looking for a nice place to enjoy Italian Cuisine, this place has you covered."}
{"text":"Nice lil family run place offering authentic Italian fare!    Quaint and cozy with seating for roughly 50-70 people with the owner and his wife making sure everything is up to par.    We started with the complimentary warm bread with savory garlic butter followed by bruschetta which was delicious    My entree was the veal scallopine with a side of pasta in traditional red sauce! I like my sauce with a hint of sweetness but it was still tasty    The veal was tender with just the right combo of white wine capers n lemon  only problem they were small portions for sure.    Hubby ordered pep n sausage hand tossed pizza and seemed pleased- the 16 inch is enough for two.   I ordered Tiramisu to go so I look forward to it being a sweet treat to a good meal.    From glancing around it looks like most of the entrees are generous portions so my veal dish must have been an exception.    This is our 2nd time here and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"The restaurant is quaint. However, the pizza was extremely salty. An ordinary cheese 16 inch and could barely taste the tomato sauce."}
{"text":"My wife and I use to come here on dates over 20 years ago. We stop here every time we are in the area. They still have the best marinara sauce in Charlotte. Great pizza and awesome chicken cacciatore. Still run by the family and same quant atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time here while on a mini get away .The pizza was hot and tasty. We had the pepperoni sausage and mushroom and olive pizza . It was very family friendly owner came over and talked to the men he was friendly and his wife also came over and refilled our drinks . I also tried the cannoli it was good"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the fact that this restaurant is locally owned by a kind family who interact with customers. The pizza was okay... I wish it had more sauce & cheese as it was a bit dry. The wings were breaded & lacked buffalo sauce, but they were very accommodating and provided extra sauce per request. Again, great customer service, but not sure if I'll return for the pizza. I may try a pasta dish next time!"}
{"text":"A rare gem in University Area.  The pizza is delicious (and the pasta dishes).The service is excellent. The deserts are always delicious. The ambiance is a whole in the wall pizza joint that you could easily find in NY. The owner is very friendly. A great place to bring family- and far superior to most pizza places in the area."}
{"text":"Just left this place. Definitely not the greatest of first time experiences.... A friend and i went for lunch. Upon entering, no greeting or \"Welcome\" what so ever. We wanted to see a menu, before deciding whether or not to eat in. A fellow Customer, sitting and eating his own lunch, had to direct us to where we could get a menu to look at. After deciding to give the place a chance and seating ourselves, our drink orders were taken. Their sweet tea definitely was NOT up to par with southern standards. Fast forward to us getting our food, i ordered their 2-slice Sicilian thick pizza lunch special. Definitely not impressed, as there was very little sauce shared on the pizza and there must not have been much variety in the cheeses as there was very little flavor. My friend ate the Mangia Mangia chicken Parm sandwhich. Never have i ever been to any food chain that provided only one type of one brand of chips as the only side item, i.e. UTZ Original chips, until I ate at this restaurant! Then, the waitress did not seem very interested in providing adequate customer service. It took a long while before our drinks were refilled, and she only checked on us once, toward the end of our meal. The only time she seemed polite was when giving us a check"}
{"text":"We are in town for the race and with the rain delay we found ourselves with a free Saturday. We found Amalfi's on Yelp, loved that it is family owned, and came by for pasta, although the pizza also looks amazing. We had the fried ravioli appetizer and the fry was really light and the mozzarella was very fresh. For our entrees we had the fettuccine bolognese and ravioli with meat sauce. Both were the best we've had in a long time. Topped it off with cheesecake for dessert and stellar service and the evening was nothing short of perfect."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizzerias in Charlotte. Their pizza is delicious and is always done fast. Great prices and family owned. Owners are friendly and always give my son a lollipop once he's done. My in laws love their spaghetti and meatballs. It's always a good time time."}
{"text":"After Bill's gushing review, we were in the mood for Italian and decided to check out Amalfi.  Side note: \"Amalfi\" is apparently the correct name of the place (actually Amalfi Italian Cuisine) - and there is a review for \"Amalfi\", but this isn't it.  \"Amalfi's\" was entered when the place was created, and has more reviews (3 to 1, soon to be 4 to 1), so I'm putting this here.  I've asked the powers that be to combine them, and we'll see what happens.  Anyway - we were impressed with the service.  It was a Sunday night, so things were pretty slow, but the service was friendly, and one area where other places fall flat (keeping the glasses full) was handled deftly here.  They actually fill your glass and then bring you an extra so you can top yourself off in case they don't get back in time.  Rarely does that happen, however, as many times they filled you up with the end of the second one, and then brought you another one of those.  Very impressive.  When it came to the food, you could pick up the aroma from the parking lot - they like garlic and plenty of it.  So if you don't, go elsewhere.  There was garlic in the soup (red pepper and roasted garlic), on the bread (garlic knots), on the pizza (to be fair, I asked for it) and on the chicken (in hefty slices).  They probably have a garden of the stuff.  There was surely garlic in the sauces as well - this is just the garlic you could see.  Most everything was tasty, only a couple areas fell down.  The salad was a fairly wimpy side salad absolutely coated in dressing.  This wouldn't be so bad, but to get it you have to choose between pasta and a salad with your entree.  And if you want both?  It's an extra charge.  To make matters worse, neither the pasta nor the salad is particularly impressive or worth the charge.  As much as I hate a la carte menus, it would be better to take that off the dinner and sell them a la carte so they could do them better.  I'll agree with Bill that the pizza crust is pretty good - a nice, thin crust that holds up well.  Unfortunately the pizza itself was a bit off.  I had a \"white\" pizza that strangely wasn't white.  They could be avoiding Aryan stereotypes or something, I don't know.  But rather than a bunch of cheese, it was a cheese base (ricotta), with another cheese on top (mozzarella, I think), and then a couple of meats (ham and canadian bacon).  I also swapped out the sun-dried tomatoes for fresh garlic.  Now I don't mind the ingredients, and for what they were, it wasn't bad.  It was just strange that it was a white pizza is all, as I'd never had it before.  I also ended up dunking it in some of the leftover marinara from the garlic knots and it was a lot better.  I think that if I had chosen a standard pizza (like pepperoni), I'd have liked it better.  Sometimes the unusual choice can backfire, and here it did.  We finished up with a dessert, and I can't recall the name.  It was a couple small scoops of ice cream that had a bit of raspberry in the center, and all of it was coated with chocolate.  Pretty tasty really, and a lovely presentation."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting from California where a friend had mentioned a restaurant in Charlotte called Amalfi. We decided to spend the afternoon lunching there and enjoyed it thoroughly. Wonderful proprietors, fantastic food, great atmosphere. Try the Chicken Vino Bianco!"}
{"text":"I took the family there last night. Best. Pizza. This. Year.  They've done something with their crust. It was positively addictive! It's not thick and doughy, but it is extremely tasty. My wife and I had their veggie pizza, which is an unusual blend of great stuff. (No, I'm not going to tell you. You have to go try it!)  One of the twins had a meatball sub. He couldn't finish it, but he tried! The other one had a couple of slices of black olive and garlic pizza and wished he had ordered three slices. He was very happy.  If you want quaint surroundings and an atmosphere filled with aromas that will pique your appetite, try this laid-back gem of Italiana in Town Center, down the hill from UNCC on 49. It's as good as, or better, than ever."}
{"text":"I've lived in the University area far too long to have never been here. This place is awesome! All the food is super authentic and prepared in house. Best arrabiata I've ever had! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for my weekly #foodieFridayfind. Which is my attempt to try restaurants that I haven't tried before. I remember coming to this place when I was a kid (because its been here forever) and I remember having the pizza but I have not been here since then.   I perused their menu on Yelp and noticed the well-priced lunch specials. Since I was in the mood for pasta, I decided to give their fettuccine alfredo a try.   I called in and placed my order with a pleasant gentleman on the phone. He told me my order would be ready at 2:05pm.  I found this very refreshing being that most places just say 10 or 15 minutes.   At 2:00 pm, I walked in and my order was already ready. The lady behind the counter had a personality so dry you could make sandpaper from it. When I walk in she said, \"Are you Britt?\" (Uh,,,what if I wasn't?!...But that's beside the point.) And began to ring me up without any further exchange.   After our awkward exchange, a kind older gentlemen came up and began chatting with me.  I looked in the bag and asked if there was salt and pepper and realized there were no utensils.  He handed me a wrapped set which had everything I needed inside.  I initially noticed him making his rounds to tables inside and outside, chatting up the clients. When we started talking, I realized he was the same gentleman that took my order so efficiently.  He has outstanding customer service and rapport building skills and was a breath of fresh air.       Beware the decor is definitely a bit dated but it is clean inside and out.    I had my typical open-air, picnic lunch (aka lunch in the car with the windows open).   First I went for the salad, it was disappointing at best: Red-tinted iceberg with a single tomato wedge.  The dressing was labeled as a balsamic vinaigrette on the menu but was really just oil and vinegar and no seasonings. I added some salt and pepper went for it. It was lackluster at best.    The bread was better.  It is definitely their pizza dough rolled in the form of a bread stick/mini loaf  It had that characteristic yeast-forward flavor of fresh pizza dough which may be off putting to some, but I thought it was pretty good.  It was certainly hot and fresh and had good texture, so all pluses there.    Admittedly at this point, I was skeptical about how the pasta was going to taste and I prepared for the worse. I was thinking that all my fellow Yelpers had led me into the lion's den ...But alas...  Yelp doesn't disappoint!  The pasta was absolutely amazing and quite possibly the most well-executed fettuccine alfredo I've ever had.  Perfectly smooth, quality ingredients, well-spiced.  The pasta was perfectly al dente with just the right amount of salt and pepper.  This whole meal (pasta, salad and bread) set me back less than $8. #win  I cannot wait to come back to have this dish again and try some of their other delectable delights."}
{"text":"I'd love to review this place but since their hours are wrong on Yelp and they allow Yelp ordering I wasted 40 minutes ordering and going to get it just to find out they closed at 10 not 11 so no one received my order.   Pretty awful experience after driving five hours and being tired, starving, and wanting nothing more than to get to my hotel and relax.   Please fix your hours to spare the next person the struggle of finding a good local pizza at 11pm after driving to your closed location."}
{"text":"I loved the pasta here! It was so good and flavorful.  It was also filling. It came with bread and a salad.  I have also had the pizza here which was great also.  A little bit of slow service around lunchtime, but well worth it."}
{"text":"What a rad little joint. The neon on the windows facing the \"street\" got my tummy growling as we walked up. Dunno how long these guys have been here but I felt immediately comfy - reminded me of my favorite pizzeria as a kid, except no Galaga.  Prices hovered around the super reasonable range on apps, a little high on pie and entrees. But yeah - great crust. Found myself eating it plain, with the pizza, dipping it in various things, sprinkling parm and hot pepper flakes on a plate and wiping, yeah, let's try it with some of that butter, etc. Bread was perfect, hot hot hot, thin crust and soft interior. Bruschetta simple but good. Salad dressing eh.  Margherita pie was really good - an interesting line between a street-style NY slice and something fancier. As in, all the crisp-but-chewiness, salt, and grease, but richer flavors.   Pasta dish was equally good - ziti and tomato, garlic, smoked mozz. Really hard to make myself take some home rather than scarf it all, right then. Only complaint - slivered garlic was pickled? Hmm.  If I lived anywhere near here, I'd eat here often enough to add some points to my cholesterol count, fo' sho'. As it is, we'll keep it for a special northside treat."}
{"text":"I'm giving it three stars because the food was delicious. I won't give it 5 because I was so on edge the whole time my friend and I were eating. It was a slow night there, and there were more staff on than patrons.  I love it when servers are attentive at restaurants, but our waitress was clearly trying to rush us out the door. She asked my friend if she wanted a to go box while we were still eating. My friend also asked her for a to go sweet tea and she said she could bring her a cup, but that she wouldn't give her a fresh one.  The whole time one of the staffers glared at me. I know this wasn't just in my head because when I went to go pay she turned around to continue staring at me. I was made to feel so uncomfortable the whole dinner.  I suggest getting Amalfi to go. The food was great, but the service was awful."}
{"text":"Nice place to have dinner or pizza. Staff was wonderful. Food was very good. Eggplant bake and pizza was outstanding. Only thing that kept it from 5 stars was the salad was not crisp, fresh or very green. Otherwise it was excellent"}
{"text":"Just visited for the first time and I will say, we will be returning very soon! Got the penne amalfitana pasta, it was full of flavor and a great size! Everything on the menu sounded very authentic and I can't wait to try more items. Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Great food, but not so good service.   They clearly cater to new Yorkers and regulars"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and exquisite food.  The owner came out and spoke to each table and was warm and genuine.   His wife is a native of Italy and all the dishes on the menu are her own creation.  If you are in the University area and want authentic Italian food, this is the place! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I came here with my best friend while she was visiting and our waiter was very friendly and outgoing! The food was fantastic! This evening, I just got spaghetti and meatballs to go and it is delicious! The family that owns it is super nice and the restaurant itself is a comfortable place to eat and chat. I am already looking forward to my next meal from there! Amalfi's is a very good place to go for authentic Italian food!"}
{"text":"I wanted to order from here tonight so I looked over their menu, tried to order on the site but it was to confusing so I called. Someone answered the phone just by saying the name of the place in a rude tone, didn't say \"what can I help you with\"  or anything I asked to place an order for delivery he said you need to call my delivery service number and he gave it to me. I called no answer! So needless to say don't even bother ordering from this place they're a mess."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time Saturday evening.  Went early.  About 5:30 PM. A small place buried in a strip mall. If you didn't know it was there, you would never know it was there. Only one table occupied and staff sitting in the dining room chatting.  I thought uh oh.   Not to worry.   Started with the soup of the day.  Tomato bisque with basil. Delicious. But screamin' hot so be careful!  I selected the angel hair pasta with creamy pesto sauce and shrimp/scallops. Again, delicious.  And plenty of it!  It came with a small loaf of nice Italian bread and a salad.   Service was prompt and I was well cared for.   By the time I left at 6:15 the dining room was 3/4 full and carry out pizza flying out the door. My new favorite spot for pasta for sure. I will be back without a doubt and will try the pizza next."}
{"text":"To start, we didn't try the pizza, so it may be great, but we didn't get it.   We decided to sit down here and eat. The bread was not good at all...which we always look forward to. The garlic knots were pretty good, though. We ended up getting a pasta dish, which was good, but not great.   The only real negative was the service. Our server was not attentive and far from friendly.   For the price, the food was ok and the service was poor. Most likely never going back here."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte.   Order a whole pizza, hot and fresh is the best.  Slices are just ok but not as good.  I had a thin pepperoni pizza. Awesome!  Haven't had anything else on the menu"}
