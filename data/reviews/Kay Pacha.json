{"text":"Went and tried this place for the first time last night. It isn't big which probably suits it. At this time I'd say book plenty in advance especially if you are going to go on Friday/Saturday night. They book up fast.  Service was pretty good, and turnover is quick in this place too. Even if you order quite a few things you aren't likely to spend more than an hour and a half here.   Between my wife and I, we had 3 sharing plates which were the frites, mango ceviche, and beef hearts. Then shared a main of the octopus drowned in a lot of oversalted mush. Food wise place was good but nothing incredibly memorable. Cocktails are way overpriced for a place like this, and they kept playing a lot of stuff like the Weeknd and Drake in there. Not sure what type of environment they are trying to create here.   The place is worth a shot once, but for 3 sharing plates, and one main, 2 drinks and no dessert, came to just under $130 with tip. Didn't really feel it was worth that much."}
{"text":"Just awesome Peruvian. Now my third experience and undeniably the best. Will be back soon, maybe even tomorrow"}
{"text":"Came here once, the atmosphere was really cool, not for children and I really loved the ceviche."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to this restaurant for a long time and I was really excited to try this restaurant but left very disappointed. I went on Sunday at 8:15pm, a bit late for our 8pm reservation. Upon looking at the menu I immediately felt let down that so many of the dishes that I saw on their website were not available, it was almost a completely different menu. The menu is meant for sharing so the two of us ordered six dishes from their snacks section and skipped the mains since they didn't really appeal to us. (They didn't have the octopus on the menu.)  All six dishes came at once and flooded our table. I thought this was odd since some dishes were bound to get cold. I've been to other restaurants before where they preface that dishes will arrive as they are ready and in no particular order but usually it's not literally all at once. Also, the server never described the dishes, they were kind of just placed there. I thought maybe all the dishes came at once because it was meant for sharing family style but then at 9pm, our server told us the kitchens will be closing soon and asked if we wanted anything else like dessert. We were hardly through our dishes and it made us feel really rushed. They did state they could still do dessert if we decided later though, but all the pacing was just so odd and uncomfortable.  The food itself was a bit disappointing as well. We got the grilled squid and it was a bit chewy and overcooked. We had a sliced trout with blood orange sauce where the sauce just tasted like blood orange juice with olive oil and was quite bland despite the vibrant look of the dish. Ceviche is one of my favourite dishes and their ceviche was fairly good when eaten with the sweet potato but overall a little too acidic. My boyfriend really liked the potatoes with huacaina sauce and said it tasted like the ones he had in Peru. Personally, I thought it was a bit boring and the cheese sauce reminded me a bit of processed cheese (but admittedly, this is probably a personal taste issue). We also got a beef empanada and that actually was really yummy and had a great chimichurri sauce, probably our favourite item of the night.   When they initially asked how we liked the food, I hadn't tasted any of it yet and said everything looked good. I wish I had said something later about how the squid was overcooked but I had already felt rushed so I chickened out. Also, I didn't know how to express it wasn't just one dish we didn't like. Plus we were actually really hungry when we got there so we did eat all the food so it would have been weird to say something after the fact.   All our seafood apps were around $20 and I felt like the food was a bit overpriced for the quality. The quantity of the trout was actually really small too, maybe like 4 slices thinner than sashimi. The potatoes were $12, and it was four slices of boiled potatoes.   I got a cocktail as well and that was pretty good. We were going to skip on dessert since we weren't that into the food and by 9:30pm we were the only people left in the restaurant. Our waitress found out it was our anniversary so she gave us a complimentary chocolate mousse after we had paid which I thought was very nice of her. Unfortunately the mousse was not that good either, the consistency was more like a whipped ganache and kind of gummy and tasted a bit salty to me. Not light and airy at all."}
{"text":"This Peruvian restaurant has had such a hype since it's opening and finally I got to try it. I have always loved Peruvian food since I had the opportunity to travel in Peru for 2 weeks years ago. It left a great impression on me and I've always loved to try new Peruvian restaurant.   There are two of us and we shared 5 dishes in total. Overall it's a good experience. For what's worth, the portion is also good. The tastes are a bit of hit or miss to be honest, and the service was good but could be a bit better.  We had two apps. The beef heart skewers app is one of the best beef hearts I've had in life. You have to eat it with the ube, potato, egg and sauce in the dish together. The other app is a Peruvian flavour infused tamale dish - one single tamale topped with bunch of raw onion which I found it a bit bland and overpriced. Maybe the flavour is how it's supposed to be but I do find this dish a bit disappointing.    We had two main - a stir fry beef with linguine, and a Spanish style seafood fried rice. Portion was good and flavour is great. Wish there was a bit of more cheese on both dish.   We also ordered the mixed ceviche. It was served in an authentic way - with sweet potato, Peruvian corn (kernel is light yellow and huge) and roasted corn kernels, just like the one I had in Peru. The taste is a bit too citrus to my taste though probably because the whole dish was soaked in the citrus soup for too long. I understand the idea is to cook the fish with the acidity. I think if we have the option to have the sweat potato and corns on the side instead of soaked in the citrus juice so their favour remain sweet and neutral, it might be more balanced when you eat them with the fish together.  The dessert menu is a bit of disappointing to be honest. There are 4 options, a cookie, a brownie, a custard, and sponge cake. Maybe it's just to me but both of us didn't find them sound appetizing so we ended up getting dessert somewhere else.    The server we had was nice and attentive. The only thing we would say is over the 5 dishes, we had three different servers bring our dishes but none of them offered to explain what the dishes are. I think for a relatively pricy and fusion-ish restaurant with lots of international ingredients, it is sort of expected to have the server introduce the dish to its first time customers.   I love Peruvian food so I might return but I hope the restaurant can improve their dishes and dessert offering."}
{"text":"I am home for the holidays and my friend took me to Kay Pacha, which I understand has opened recently. It was packed! We could only reserve at the bar.  Outside it was brutally cold but the atmosphere, the decor, the friendly staff and the outstanding food, made Kay Pacha an oasis of goodness.  I live in Miami and I usually don't go to Peruvian places when I travel, but I am so glad we did - Chef Elias Salazar is a magician with flavors. He is creative and attentive and I have never had better scallops or grilled octopus.  This is a gem that is great for a date or for a group of friends."}
{"text":"My favourite Peruvian restaurant. The food is made fresh. The recipes are authentic with a modern twist. Service is great."}
{"text":"Yes the menu online is not what you will see when you get there.  We were disappointed for a few minutes BUT it doesn't matter.  Everything was amazing!  Went with a few friends and we tried about 5 dishes, all delicious, especially the ceviche, so fresh and flavourful.  The cocktails are inspired and fresh as well.  Can't wait to go back and enjoy \"Alejandro's Juice\" with my food!  Oh, and deserts were perfection as well."}
{"text":"We had 6 different dishes and enjoyed every single one - it was hard to pick a favourite. Everything was super fresh and flavourful. We were most impressed though by the staff - our server was extremely attentive and it was refreshing to see how genuinely passionate he was about the food; you could tell he genuinely cared about your experience and if you enjoyed what you were eating. Another staff member also brought us over a squid dish that the chef had accidentally cooked an extra plate of, which was super generous and above and beyond! As we left, the chef himself came to shake our hands and thank us. Overall, my entire family left happy and full from some excellent food. We went for my mom's birthday but I'd recommend this restaurant for any occasion, whether special or just casual."}
{"text":"We came at the restaurant on a Tuesday nite , manager was talking to a friend so we have to wait waitress to sit us. We order pisco sour , served ina small glass of 4 oz , it was very citric we don\"t feel the pisco, and served with cinnamon instead of bitter , cinnamon hides the taste of pisco (16$ each.) As starters we ordered ,chicken  tamalito verde(10$) and conchas parmesana(12$) , the paste of tamalito was tastefull but not made with fresh hominy corn but commercialized corn flour.No chicken inside and the sarza , red salad onion was so spicy that hides all other flavors. The concas , second starter , ONE scallops U10 with melted cheese was ok. We asked wine pairing ,and waitress suggested a pinot noir ,as sommelier , I told her that it is not a good match with lamb , she answeded \"\" You asked for a suggestion , I gave you one! As main , we orderd Seco de cordero (34$) and arroz chauffa de pato (32$) ,Lamb was generous but not braised as it should be but confited and fat , and not flavors that reminds me my trips to Peru, white rice was cooked with only water ,no salt and garlic as as all south American country does.Duck and rice was ok, but the duck was overcooked, the ricetaste only soysauce , no ginger or tiny sliced green onions as it should be.Also the dish was topped with an omelette with a tauil-on shrimp that a have to remouve the tail from my mouth in public!The bottle of winre was good but pricy(90$).Dessert choclate mousse and tiramisu were fine.Pisco shot digestives as we request because waitress tought service is finished after desserts was rought , pisco PORTON taste only alcool and doesn't have the subtility of other brands.(20$). If you visit Kay Pacha prepare to open your wallet , 316$ for 2 , 373$ with tips, overpriced for a medium satisfying experience."}
{"text":"We experienced the New Years Eve menu It was excellent Fresh flavours with attention paid to the importance of certain elements of Peruvian food( i.e. The potato) The Pisco menu was great  We will be returning to try out the regular menu"}
{"text":"Wow!.. we just finished a meal at Kay Pacha and does it ever live up to all the hype. We're local and Kay Pacha has been on our radar since it popped up. Given all the recent media hype it's been given, I was a little nervous that it couldn't live up to my expectation.. boy was I wrong.   From the moment we entered Kay Pacha we felt attended to, welcomed and the passion of every single person in the restaurant is felt.   Our sever, James was tops. The bartenders were lovely.. the post dinner digestif you crafted up was DELICIOUS. James - thanks for convincing us to try the sponge cake, it did not disappoint!   The food.. was unreal. We didn't have a single bad bite.   Can't wait to come back. You guys are unreal. Welcome to the hood!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and staff at Kay Pacha were all very friendly, but the food itself was over-priced and underwhelming.  We were recommended all dishes by the waiter.  For appetizers we had the ceviche, which was too acidic and citrus-heavy, and the crab dish with a heavy cheese-based sauce served luke-warm and overly \"fishy\" taste.  The main courses priced at almost $30 each were primarily rice dishes with ordinary vegetables (onions, carrots) and one protein (lamb, chicken were the ones we were recommended).  We could not find the chicken in that plate, and both dishes were heavily sauced with cheese-based goo, and even that did not improve the overall taste, which in the end, was basic and bland.  Over priced and unimaginative.  Would not go here again."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. The food at at Kay Pacha is truly Peruvian and can not be compared to any other spot in the city.  Decor/Ambience The bright space welcomes a casual attire but feels classy without trying. The bar is great if you are going out with a friend for a cocktail and the tables are an excellent choice for a date or a large table. I think anyone who appreciates good food would feel welcome.  Food If you really want to enjoy yourself, please consider:  Cassava Fries/Yuca Frita (good for two people)  Empanada de Carne (unlike anything I've ever had)  U10 Scallop (ridiculously flavourful, sashimi grade)  The Ceviche (mandatory, pick anyone, you won't be sorry, thank me later)  Pulpo al Olivo (may change your life)  I personally would order a bunch of smaller plates and one large plate (Don't forget about The Ceviche).   Cocktails The cocktails were insane and I felt pretty good after one. Perhaps that's why we ordered a second. We ordered two. I forgot the names already but it's okay because everything here is truly phenomenal.  Price/Quality Extremely reasonable considering the quality of each and every dish. You can see the kitchen. Between the two of us, we spent less than a hundred dollars.  Other Tips Highly recommend this place if you are going for a date, dinner with colleagues, meeting your in-laws, groups up to 6-8 people and even if you are down to go alone. I would budget 1 hour to 1.5 hours so can pace yourself and enjoy yourself.  I recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"As a Peruvian I can say I absolutely loved this place!! The causa limeña was delicious.. you could taste the yellow potatoes. We then had the pulpo a la Parrilla... which unexpectedly came with carapulcra. It was by far my favorite! It took me back home. And finally we had the ceviche de carretilla.. which was everything I hoped for. Just come, you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I gave Kay Pacha a try a couple of weeks ago and this may be my favourite new restaurant!  The service was excellent, the ambiance was very intimate and the food is bursting with flavour.  I'm not one to try exotic food, but the menu prepared here caters to all tastes as I found the tapas style dishes to be reminiscent of other styles of cuisine. Also, the perfectly designed dessert menu left me wanting to come back just for sweets. 5/5 must try."}
