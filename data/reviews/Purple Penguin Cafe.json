{"text":"The baristas here are always friendly, and the apple fritters are a must try. I would definitely recommend this place over the Starbucks across the street if you want to have a relaxed place to sip on your cup of joe. The Purple Penguin has many cosy booths with wide tables, so it makes for an incredible studying spot. It can get a little busy on weekends, so I'd recommend coming during weekdays when it's quieter. The booths also give some privacy for conversations with friends. The coffee tends to be a little acidic but I know a lot of people that love it, and make sure to get a large because the sizes are a little small."}
{"text":"My BLT on a pumpernickel bagel was heaven. It was steaming hot right from the panini press, with perfectly crisped bacon and fresh, juicy tomato. Coffee was sublime, as well. I don't even live in the area but I will travel out of my way to go back and eat here. Loved it! Can't wait to try the fritters."}
{"text":"I come to this lovely café, technically every single day. When you walk in, you feel a wonderful and peaceful energy, and that's what makes me come back all the time. 

They have a wonderful and delicious coffee, and very easy on your stomach, compared to Starbucks that makes me sick in the stomach. I love the atmosphere, their staff is wondeful, they are very kind and friendly, and they don't rush like any other places, where they just want you to get out of there.

The food is great as well, it is simple, economic, but, enjoyable. I love this place. I think this is what the people in Leslieville needed for a long time. 


Don't forget to try their Legendary Apple Fritters!

:)"}
{"text":"Emo music, stale bagels, they charge you if you pay with visa and they were out of coffee at 4:23pm when they close at 5pm. Also super hot inside...not sure they like running the AC. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Snacks are a bit pricey, but the beverages are great and the atmosphere is relaxing and welcoming. The seats are comfy, which is important because you can bring friends here and play board games for a while.

Having a coffee related drink and playing the available board games here is a lot of fun.

{"text":"I've never been to this cafe before and i was looking for something near my friends house to pick us up lunch. I found the Purple Penguin on yelp and the reviews seemed good so I decided to try it out. The cafe had nice decor and a cozy feel to it. The chairs are very comfortable and they have high stools along the windows. A group of three had just arrived ahead of me, other than that the place was empty. There were two staff there that I saw and there were two tables that needed clearing (some of the only comfy places to sit left) that no one attended to the entire time i was there (say ten to fifteen minutes) , even when a family with some young children came in and they kind of stood there awkwardly.

I ordered two chai tea lattes opting for the regular mix rather than the more expensive loose leaf option, two purple pig sandwiches and after seeing the girls ahead of me order them, as well as news articles raving about their apple fritters, i ordered 3 fritters. The food was...okay. There was nothing wrong with it, everything tasted fresh, the chicken was nicely cooked but overall the sandwich was just kind of bland. The lattes were also bland, hardly any chai spice taste to it, it tasted mostly like frothy milk, which was disappointing. All that being said, i am coming back because oh my the fritters are AMAZING. I've never had fritters so good before!

The staff member I dealt with was friendly and helpful. I really struggled with what rating to give this review because i was not thrilled with the majority of my food but in the end, the nice atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing fritters pushed it up to a three star review. I'm hoping it was just an off day and the next time i go will be a better experience. I'll update this review (hopefully to add at least one more star) once i've visited again."}
{"text":"You absolutely must try the spinach \mango smoothie!!  A friend of mine ordered one on MAMA PENGUINS recommendation.  I remarked that it looked gross so she let me try. What a wonderfully light and delicious combination!"}
{"text":"A fine addition to the neighbourhood. Great atmosphere, fantastic coffee, friendly staff, and an engaged owner. Everything a business needs to succeed. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Fritters are made fresh to order and tasty.  Espresso and house brew coffee are quite nice as well.  They're still struggling with new restaurant pains (order confusion, no TP in the men's room), but I'm sure they'll sort it out soon."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*

Tried this cute cafe out for the first time this morning. Loved the purple themed seats and sofas! It's a small space, but also cosy and relaxing, the plush comfy seats tempt you to stay for a long time! Service was polite and friendly and made a customisation to my sandwich (multigrain instead of white bread) with no fuss.

The menu -as far as small panini and sandwich type places go - is extensive. (Note: the menu pictures posted above by Roland are out of date, with more options available now). There's a great selection for vegetarians, while meat eaters won't be disappointed with about a dozen different meat-based choices. There's a strong emphasis on various cheeses and apple/apple butter in a lot of the options, with bacon often added to supplement the other meats in the sandwiches. Yummy! 

All expected espresso and tea-based drinks are available, as well as hot chocolates, brewed coffee (four sizes to choose from)and a smell but enticing selection of baked goods such as apple scones and the cafe's \"legendary\" apple fritters.

After being tempted by almost everything on the menu, I settled for the ham, apple and brie sandwich with a small americano. Coffee was perfect and the sandwich, despite the almost complete absence of brie (!!!), was just delicious. The ham was fresh and flavourful and the melting apple on the crunchy bread was to die for!

Why only 3.5 stars? Take a look at the picture I added of the ham, apple and brie sandwich. That sorry-sized portion cost 9.95. When I pay that amount for a sandwich, I sort of expect either a decent sized portion or a small side of fries/home fries/salad/something with it. This is the standard expectation of brunch value in the neighbourhood, and I feel if TPP continue to offer these small portions against ten dollar charges, they will very quickly price themselves out of the local market. Other competitors on the same block offer larger sandwiches with a huge side order for about the same price. Are the owners aware of this?

As mentioned, there was hardly any brie whatsoever present in the sandwich - I felt quite cheated considering the price I paid. 

And I wish they would remove the \"legendary\" apple fritter sign - how can they be legendary when the cafe has only been open a month?! I hate cheesy pretentious advertising like this!

Quite a conflicting review I know, but I wanted to tell the entire experience in as balanced a way as I could.

In summary - this place would be perfect if I were rich! Right now, theres  too much great competition nearby offering better value for similar food quality to allow me to become a regular here."}
{"text":"It is true. Leslievillians LOVE their coffee. We have an embarrassing number of cafes. And while I will never stop loving Te Aro, I admit that Purple Penguin has become my new favourite spot. 

The coffee is really good, the sandwiches (and other eats) are made in house, fresh to order and are delicious. (I am really bored of the pre-packaged sandwiches at the other cafes in the area.) Get the reuben! It is my favourite. They also have these sinful Butter tart muffins, fast wifi and REALLY comfortable chairs. If I am going to be chilling for a while, I am going to want to be comfy. The staff is sooo friendly. Always big smiles and happy to help me out with substitutions, strange requests or even my stroller (I know, I know.)"}
{"text":"Tried the Purple Penguin for the first time today. Nice decor. Large real wood tables with comfortable dining table style purple fabric chairs. Ordered an Americano which tasted good. They offer a menu of sandwiches and salads in addition to some pastries. Good location right on Queen street east. Prices are a bit higher than across the street at Starbucks. The ability to relax on comfortable chairs makes this a nice place to stop for break."}
{"text":"This is my new fav place in Leslieville - healthy food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere. Their apple fritters are really good, and so are their salads, sandwiches and smoothies.  I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, and healthy! Ambiance is great. Quiet, clean, free wifi, beautiful decor. Came in for a coffee, ended up getting frozen yogurt! 

Took a look at the options on the menu, and will definitely be coming back for a brunch!"}
{"text":"We're visiting from Detroit and stopped in for breakfast and coffee. The coffee is delicious, the bagels great. The fritters are made to order, yum. My husband got the quiche. I didn't try it, but it was beautiful. My husband sad it and the soup were superb. 

The space is very cozy and our server was very Canadian friendly (if you are from the states, you know what I mean). If you're in the neighborhood, make sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"So not impressed. I went back here because I had a great cappuccino last I was here. This time I actually walked past 3 cafes to come back here. I asked for two single shot Lattes with Soy milk. The guy making the Lattes said no problem
And started to make a double shot. When I said wait is that a single. He said \"oh no-it's ok, I'll just make it a single. Stopped the machine mid way then placed the other cup under it and started the machine again. Anyone who works at an espresso bar --like I have--knows you do not do that. I don't think I'll ever come back as Mercury coffee is a block away and I couldn't see them do that."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are excellent - simple but exceptionally tasty. I got the purple pig, which was absolutely delicious. Quality ingredients and very well prepared. The real star was the apple fritter, though. Oh my god, it was so damn good. I wish I had gotten 3."}
{"text":"Fantastic fritters!!!! The fritters are thinly sliced granny smith apples battered, fried then dusted in cinnamon sugar. Euphoric! I had the chocolate roobois mint tea as well, very nice. The tea bags looked different than what I'm used to. Kinda cool. The location couldn't be any more perfect, corner lot at queen and Logan. I was there while it was snowing outside, so the big open windows were great to watch the snow fall and the cars pass by. I'll definitely be back to try some of there other items, but 5 stars alone for what I did order. The cashier Erica acknowledged my group as soon as we entered and was very nice and helpful. And the manager June came from the kitchen and brought our fritters and chatted with us a while. Top notch products, top notch service. 5 stars all around"}
{"text":"Favorite cafe in Toronto found! Comfortable clean bright with fantastic food and drinks. Lovely staff. The made-to order apple fritters are a bargain and the best doughnut in Toronto! At $1.75/fritter, you can't loose. Quick wifi too. Support a small cafe vs starbucks accross the street. And it's called the Purple Penguin, COME ON."}
{"text":"I had the hand pressed grapefruit juice, and the Purple pig sandwich. It's was so delightful- walnut bread, chicken breast, bacon, carmelized onions, arugula and Brie. Just wow. Good food, friendly staff, clean cafe....love it."}
{"text":"Not a better place in the hood for homemade food and you can't beat the prices! Great coffee and specialty drinks too. Oh, and you can't leave without having an apple fritter!!!"}
{"text":"A lovely spot to visit with a friend. Enjoyed having tea and apple fritter. Live music on a Thursday night was a surprise and welcomed. Cannot go wrong with having a cellist playing to customers.  Also appreciate the genuine and friendly engagement from the staff at Purple Penguin. This is just a special place where you can get a hot beverage, dessert, or a sandwich.  Pleased that they are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Food was great & served promptly - we had the reuben, grilled cheese with bacon & tomato soup. Cappuccino was also good, I ordered a plain matcha & the barista seemed confused, the matcha was bitter but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"The Purple Penguin meets all of my requirements. It has nice squishy seats, brewed coffee and free wifi. I always feel comfortable there. They also have wonderful homemade apple fritters which are made to order."}
{"text":"Small cafe that serves delicious and healthy sandwiches, bagels, and salads. I'm glad my friend and I were able to grab a seat.. considering the minimal seatings they offer.. It's cute how they have PURPLE chairs and I love how they are so comfortable to be on.  

I've seen many yelpers talk about the poor service.. I thought they were pretty friendly and patient 

Food is sooo good. I ordered an Asian pork wrap which was filling and had this delicious sauce inside lol 
- the wrap had house marinated pork, carrots, arugula, and lettuce

I also had an apple fritter : super cheap and soo delicious! It's coated with sugar and the apples tasted very fresh when I took a bite. Since they fry it, it has a nice soft crunchy texture on the outside- 
It's a must try !!

They also sell coffee! They sell Demello- apparently it's a good brand haha"}
{"text":"Apple fritters are perfect, cappuccino excellent. Friendly service. Warm and welcoming decor. Great place to relax - as I'm sitting here there's a couple at one table playing cards and a couple at another table playing Scrabble. This is my first visit - will definitely be back to try sandwiches which look fabulous."}
{"text":"I stepped into the Purple Penguin intrigued by the name and was instantly taken by the decor. The cohesive design of the place warms the heart and it feels instantly familiar. I ordered the ham, apple, and Brie sandwich and a cappuccino. The service was friendly and quick. The sandwich was absolute perfection and the cappuccino really hit the spot. This place is a welcome addition to the already fantastic Leslieville offerings. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The apple fritter is amazing and worth the trip for that alone. I'm still getting use to the menu it is very unique. You certainly won't get a more warm friendlier welcome anywhere in the L'ville. This could be the addition that is needed and long over due. We didn't' have a decent full service café in the area. Sure we had Mercury Café and Starbucks but with that I rest my case. Worth checking out, try the apple fritters."}
{"text":"Had the purple pig sandwich. Exciting that they have gluten free bread - and quite a good one, too! Overall a very good sandwich. However, $4 for the side salad is a joke; I don't think they should charge for it at all. It's barely 2 leaves of kale and it wasn't properly massaged as kale needs to be."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on an early weekday and had a nice quiet atmosphere. Many tables inside and a few outside as well. There's a variety of healthy breakfast and lunch items and decided to try the curry chicken wrap. The curry chicken mixed with the bits of onion, lettuce, and celery was very tasty, all wrapped in a spinach tortilla. I didn't get to try their coffee since I woke up early and had a cup already, but I'll definitely give it a try next time!"}
{"text":"Service very friendly and the food was good and fresh.  Coffee was expertly prepared.  No complaints here, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the apple fritters are delicious, hot and warm. Sliced apples deep fried and rolled in cinnamon sugar made fresh to order. I burned my mouth eating them because I could not wait for them to cool down!"}
{"text":"My favourite local coffee shop in Riverside. Quiet and comfortable enough that it's my go to when I want a break from the home office. Great lattes, chais and the like. Solid brewed coffee too. Knock 'em dead homemade fritters.  Great montreal style bagels that they can make in to any number of different breakfast sandwiches. 

And it may only be available on weekends, but their french toast is to die for. 

Lovely, welcoming staff."}
{"text":"Great fritter!

I can only speak to the fritter but it was quite good. We went in on a Sunday morning and ordered a few fritters. They do take a minute or two but they are made to order, I am not quite sure how this would work if it is busy. We ordered six fritters which were nice and warm, for three people and before I could even take a pic, 4 were gone.

It is a different fritter. Instead of a dough filled centre like most fritters in the case there is a large piece of apple at the centre which clearly has been dipped in a batter. They are also nicely sprinkled in cinamon sugar.

I would definitely stop by again for a fritter. 

A few suggestions to the owners, there are way to many tables here, it feels a tad crowded."}
{"text":"\"We were curious to find out from June (the owner) that Purple Penguin opened about a year ago and holds community-focused events as well as live music (harp) on occasion. \"
\"We also could not resist trying their pro-biotic frozen yogurt in a cone, like ice-cream. It was very yummy and with less fat than a traditional ice-cream. An experimental treat, we though.\"

A few bites from our full experience: http://ilianaspalette.blogspot.ca/2015/08/purple-penguin.html"}
{"text":"Apple fritters, apple fritters, and more apple fritters. I'm glad I opted to buy six instead of just buying one. I came on my birthday. I was due at Lady Marmalade for brunch, but I came down early to wander around the area. 

I was surprised to see so many people in here on a Tuesday morning. I'm talking people eating in. There are tables fairly close together, and big, cushy seats, so it makes getting to some of their window seating a tad difficult. I'm a klutz, so I was more than a little concerned I was going to hit someone or something with my bag or my coat. Thankfully, neither happened.

I heard Purple Penguin had good apple fritters, made to order, and I figured I had to try them. I'm glad I did. These fritters are $1.50 each, or $8 for 6 fritters. There's also a price for a dozen, but I forget what this is. It took a bit of a wait to get my fritters, but it was soooo worth it. I got mine to go, but I ate one while I was still there. In my attempt to take a beautiful picture for Instagram, I may have burned my fingers slightly. That's not a complaint. That's a testament to freshness. I have never eaten an apple fritter before this one. I was assuming I would get something more along the lines of a beignet or donut with apple inside. What I got was almost akin to an onion ring. Instead of onions, there was an apple slice. Instead of a crunchy, hard exterior, there was a light, fluffy batter dusted in cinnamon sugar. I very seldom say this, but I almost wish they had given me a little bit more cinnamon sugar. This isn't dessert for someone with a sweet tooth. This is subtly sweet and one of the best bites I've had in a long time.

I brought the rest of them home and I've heard that they were quite good at room temp as well.

Next time I'm in the area, I will definitely stop by and pick up more apple fritters!

Side note: If you look on their website, you'll see they have adorable Purple Penguin cookies. They are not listed on their menu, but they had them inside when I was there. They're $2.75, if I recall correctly, and they're adorable!"}
{"text":"I stumbled into the Leslieville area and wanted to get my daily dose of caffeine. I have to say I love the colour purple and when I found a cafe called Purple Penguin....Of course I had to check it out and plus reviews were great!!
Purple Penguin Cafe is located at an intersection and nicely situated at the corner. There is a Starbucks right across the street but when there's such a cute cafe ...you gotta try something new! The cafe itself is small but cozy and comfortable. I don't have to say but the purple added a positive touch for me. There is a number of yummy treats and various brewed coffee types to choose from. This would be a great place for a coffee date, a hangout spot or studying. The atmosphere is nice and casual and the staff is friendly.

I got a flat white and the espresso was bold yet not overwhelming. I enjoyed it quite a bit and will be back to try their food items and other caffeine options. 

Give it a try:)"}
{"text":"Life in violet
More homey than that Starbucks
Right across the street.

Coffee in fine glass
This the most friendly cafe
Here in Leslieville

They got a kitchen
Pumping out fresh small bites, yo
Must get apple fritters!

{TTC: Queen Street streetcars to the southeast corner at Logan Ave.}"}
{"text":"I don't really like it here.  Their apple fritters are good, but in a sea of great coffee places, this place comes up short.  I ordered a machiato, which turned out to be an espresso with a bit of milk, in a tiny cup for almost $5.  More than the portion size being ridiculously small, the coffee tasted...off.  I could hardly drink it.  It was pretty much a complete waste of $5.  Basically, it was a poor experience but an even poorer attempt at a reasonable experience.  The decor is nice, but overall, it leaves a lot to be desired.  If I weren't a big supporter of local businesses as a general rule, I wouldn't come here."}
{"text":"Cute place with a purple emphasis.  (Surprise!)  

They serve coffee, juice and have a small good menu as well.  Server was kind.

Washrooms are down a steep flight of stairs in an old basement.  They could use a thorough cleaning, though they were ok.

One thing of note:  They do have a very small apple fritter that they cook on demand with real apple.  It was delicious - warm, fresh and tasty.  This, if anything, is a reason to stop here.

Would I recommend?  for people in the area it is an option.
Would I return? unlikely.  there are lots of other options to check out."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, coffee is tasty, but the salad (which is 7 dollars) was not nearly enough to fill me up. I have eaten side salads that are bigger than this. Really unfortunate."}
{"text":"NICEST OWNER ON BLOCK.

There is coffee everywhere in area and no one nicer than this lady. No food is better either because all food home cook fresh in back. Nothing frozen like Starbucks. 

Bathroom scary. Do not be alarm. Always clean, smell nice and comfortable place to do personal business. 

Coffee better than average but not best. Food best.

Things to try:
-Fresh Apple Fritters
-Dr. Seuss Sandwhich
-A Penguin Cookie
-Snow White Salmon
-The Penguin Morning

Lots of reasons to come back...Maybe you see me there? :3"}
{"text":"Came across this place while running errands. Needed a quick, relatively cheap eats pick me up. I ended up getting a lot more than that. To start I ordered a Ruben sandwich and a vanilla latte. The sandwhich was great and the latte was amazing! I was about to leave when I saw they had in house, made fresh to order apple fritters. OMG......the fritters are unbelievable. If you're in the area definitely stop by the Purple Penguin."}
{"text":"This is a really nice cheerful little cafe. Try the carrot soup - yum."}
{"text":"The spot is very warm and welcoming. The tables make for a great space to have a quick bite or a long work session.  The staff is very friendly and ready to help with suggestions.  The $$though.... a bit much for what you actually get. I'd come for the coffee but it's not worth the cost for much else. 
But great space!"}
{"text":"This little cafe is cute, and it's not just the name and the decor. The service is welcoming and friendly, and the workers are very accommodating. It's a nice place to have a chat and unwind, or even play a game or two."}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop in Leslieville. Across the street from  Sbux but it's usually busy. Nice view of the street so it's a good people watching place. I prefer the coffee to Sbux and there's nice pastries and light lunches too. Cheerful staff. Good spot!"}
{"text":"we live in this neighbourhood. The atmosphere is nice, but the menu is very limited. It doesn't offer real meal except sandwiches and salads. They make sandwiches fresh, so we waited for a long time to get the sandwiches. It was very skimpy and small for more than 10 dollars sandwiches. The taste is not that spectacular, you can get a better sandwich and cheaper in this neighbourhood. I don't even want to try other things on the menu. We spent more than 30 dollars for two small, thin sandwiches and one coffee, one soda..... way too pricey."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in the 'hood, I stop here. Believe it or not, tonight was the first time we tried the fritters. Incredible. But the sandwiches: I've had the Reuben and the Purple Penguin with walnut bread, it's been so good. Not to mention -- fine coffee. Go. Do yourself a favor. Go."}
{"text":"Based solely on the Apple Fritter. (which is advertised out front so if you lead with your best foot...)
I was so excited for a made-to-order apple fritter. I love fritters. They're my favourite doughnut. 

Yuck.

Under cooked, airy donut that was bland and definitely not in my definition of a traditional apple fritter which is more dense and cake-like. (Just look at my picture of it).

Very dark interior. The chairs were comfortable."}
{"text":"I strolled in here randomly on a lazy Sunday afternoon and I've become a fan! I much prefer this place over Starbucks across the street if they opened later and if Sbux didn't have their loyalty program that keeps me going back for more.

{"text":"This local cafe has it all: delicious, fresh food, great coffee and friendly staff. The lovely owner, June, has done a wonderful job of putting together a varied menu of sandwiches, salads, and breakfast items. I just tried their French Toast made with brioche and served with apples, whipped cream and syrup. Mmm good! Why anyone would stand in line as they do for some of the other restaurants in the area is beyond me."}
{"text":"I went here on a Savour Toronto coffee tour and it was delicious - they had the apple fritters and frozen yogurt available for us to try. Both were so tasty and not too sweet which I loved. The atmosphere is really warm and welcoming. Definitely want to get back to check out more menu items soon."}
{"text":"3.5 actually. This is a not so bad place, Kinda cosy cafe, rustic decor, great window lighting since it is on the corner. Good for people watching. Super friendly and helpful staff.
I do like their selection of drinks and tea though I did not order any myself. I do like their selection of sandwiches and snacks. 
I had one apple fritter which was good, if you like it puffy and doughy with the right amount of sugar and cinnamon, made as ordered, so fresh. 
The Purple pig panini was, ok. I like the freshness of it and the attempt at a unique combo of foods and the purple walnut bread is a nice touch. However, the main reason as to why I knocked off 1.5 stars is the taste. It fell short of what I expected. I love brie - the mildness of it, but to put it with a plain chicken breast and plain (though healthy) spinach ? Not much taste there. I thought that the bacon would be the hero of this but it wasn't, I didnt seem to taste much of it and it looked more like black forest ham \"bacon\". Not the expected thin greasy, salty crunchy bacon strips I expected. 
Anyhow, over all not a bad place. Pretty good if you want some good bites, but nothing that wowed me. 
I should go back to try their coffee though."}
{"text":"Excellent friendly service, great coffee, and overall awesome place. And it's not packed the the brim with loud people/babies (like Te-Aro), so great place to get a little work done too ;) Thanks Jun!"}
{"text":"Relaxing, peaceful, and never got too busy. Cute comfy chairs that engulf you. Delicious coffee, friendly service. I cannot ask for anything more. Some pastries if you're hungry during your 4-hour stay (like ours)!! I just came for the latte, which I had 2 of.

We sort of took the table for hours. Time just flew!! But we never felt rushed to get up from the big comfy chair. Nor did we feel like we HAD to order seconds. It's a terrific place to stay. There are many options for your coffee in this area, but Purple Penguin wins the \"catch-up date spot\" award."}
