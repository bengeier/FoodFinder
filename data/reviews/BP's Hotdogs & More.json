He was awesome with the customers at the event, and to my office! He helped us with more than hotdogs. He event brought extra canopy's to help provide shade, it was a nice added touch. I look forward to working with BP's Hotdogs & More again!"}
{"text":"We selected BP's Hotdogs and More to provide hotdogs and hamburgers and ice cream for our All Employee Meeting.  My Sr Administrator dealt with them from beginning to end and she fed back that they were extremely pleasant.  We had to change the date of our meeting and they were very accommodating to our problem.  We received many, many compliments from our employees about the quality of the food provided by BPs'.  Not one negative word was spoken.    Not only was the food outstanding, but the service provided by BP and Hans was amazing.  They certainly know the meaning to customer service.  We highly recommend them!  UPDATE 04/08/2015: We brought BP's back for another one of our team meetings and they once again knocked it out of the park!  Food quality and quantity was excellent.  The staff on-hand was great to work with.  Customer service is one of their core values and it really shows.  Still highly recommended and we will bring them back again in the future for our team events."}
