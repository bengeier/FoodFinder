{"text":"If you like loud places, this is for you. The noise in the place was deafening.  The pizza was average, nothing special."}
{"text":"Decent Pizza. Not the best, not the worst. Cool atmosphere though. And super nice people whp work there."}
{"text":"It's opening day!! And you'd never know it!! Service is awesome and they're knowledgeable of food/drink. We're so exited to have y'all in downtown Matthews!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Pizza Peel for lunch today and I have to say it's a very good place to eat. I ordered and custom 8 inch pepperoni pizza and it's was perfect size. The service was great and their menu has some variety. It's not just pizza but burgers and pasta's as well. The next time I come back I definitely want to try something different. Highly recommended for anyone."}
{"text":"Terrible service , sat at the bar at 5 o'clock , asked the bartender how much was a Bud Light and she told me $2.50 , there were 5 employees at the bar and was ignored for 15 minutes , got my check and it was $3.79 ,  they were having a party and had to stand on my stool to get there attention , I guess it was acceptable because the manager was having a party with them !"}
{"text":"Just checked out Pizza Peel with a friend and her kids. The kids had a small cheese pizza and the adults ordered a large pizza with different toppings on each half. They were very accommodating and the pizza was great! The cheese pizza came out quite a bit later than the large and the manager offered to take it off our tab due to the wait. Which was unexpected and nice! The only downside is that the tables are small for four people...was difficult to find room for 2 pizzas, plates, and drinks, but we made it work!"}
{"text":"Pizza Peel & Tap Room is one of the most popular places that people love where I work, so my family went for dinner today. It was very crowded since it was a Friday night, and they said that our table of 4 would be ready in 40 minutes, but we decided to wait. It actually only took about 15 minutes. We ordered wings as an appetizer. My younger daughter has severe allergies to cumin, peanuts, and treenuts. The service was good. After we ordered, the waitress came and told us that the barbecue sauce has cumin in it. My daughter wasn't eating it, but we thanked her for letting us know, because that is good service.  The barbecue wings were the best thing that we had. The were really plump so there was a lot of meat to them. They could have used a bit more sauce. They were also very crispy.  My older daughter got The Basic Burger with no cheese. She said that it was average. It was ordered medium well, but came out well. The house chips were good and you could tell that they were freshly fried, but they has lots of paprika on them and were very strong.  My younger daughter and I shared a 16 inch cheese pizza. I thought that the crust was very good, the cheese was good, but the sauce was very strange and not good. My younger daughter thought  that the sauce had a very interesting flavor. \" The sauce was disgusting!\" My wife ate food beforehand, but she tried a slice. She also didn't like the sauce. The sauce had some spices that we didn't think really belonged on pizza. We will probably not be coming back to Pizza Peel & Tap Room."}
{"text":"First time visit to the Pizza Peel. Kim, our server was excellent. We ordered two pizzas, a supreme and a roasted veggie. One pizza was over cooked, they apologized and made a new pie. The food was excellent with fresh ingredients and delivered hot and delicious to our table. They also comped us free banana pudding which was fantastic. They went above and beyond to deliver a great product. The food was great and the service from Kim and management gets highly praise from me.   We will certainly be going back for more great food. Thank you for exceeding our expectations."}
{"text":"Had a great time on opening night! Even though they were slammed, we still had great, attentive service and delicious food. We have been waiting for this one to open because we met at the Cotswold location on a blind date 5+ years ago so we had high expectations and they did not disappoint. Our server even surprised us with a brownie a la mode when we told her our story! We had The Godfather, which was a new one for us, but we will certainly be getting that again. And The bruschetta was also delicious and quick so a great starter recommendation if you are hungry in a hurry. We will be back there a bunch and are so glad they lived up to our expectations!"}
{"text":"When I worked uptown, my buddy and I would occasionally venture down to the Cotswald Pizza Peel for the lunch buffet. I remember it being tasty with many beer selections. The family was craving pizza tonight so we thought it might be a good time to try the Matthews location. Upon entering, I was really impressed with the interior. I could tell that they really invested in this new location. I was the saddened by the fact that they had no beers on special tonight. I am of the opinion that if \"tap room\" is in the title of your restaurant, you should have at least two beers on special every night. When I received my over priced beer, it was good and our fried pickles app. came shortly after. The pickles were just okay. They tasted as if they had been frozen for a while and the breading was super thin. I immediately asked for another ranch dipping sauce as the container it came in was enough for about 6 pickles. It didn't matter in the end as we didn't finish all the pickles anyway. Wishful thinking I guess. After my second over priced beer, our pizzas came. The table split a cheese and a godfather. Again, just okay. I want to highlight the great service and attentive manager who both made sure that our needs were met. I just can't give it higher than a 3 because of the above reasons."}
{"text":"Pizza was good as always the salad was a disappointment..  My wife and I went to the new Matthews location of Pizza Peel and Tap Room on Monday 2/26 for the buffet lunch.  Pizza is the same as the other locations and is very good.  Service was very good, the restaurant was busy but the staff worked together well so service although a little slow was still very good given the volume they had.  Salad dressings again were great just like the other locations, the basil honey vinaigrette is the reason I go to pizza peel it is one of the best dressings I have had in my life, yummy!!  The only disappointment was the salad it self was much smaller than the other locations (Cotswald is our usual destination but Matthews is much closer to home).  I would say the salad was about 1/3 of what they serve at the Cotswald location.  The salad is one of the main reasons we choose pizza peel so we were disappointed.  We will give it one more try, if the salad is small again we will either go to Cotswald or move on to one of our other favorites."}
{"text":"Here we are at Friends and Family Night at this great new space in Matthews! We are \"frequent flyers\" at the Cotswold location and tried their new location tonight. It did NOT disappoint! Same spectacular pizza and great local beer selection, beautiful interior design, music and a few tv screens to boot! Great service even on this first night open and friendly neighborhood vibe! WE WILL BE BACK! #newfridaynightspot"}
{"text":"We sat outside, honestly inside it was very loud and with a strong Chucky cheese vibe - unexpected for a \"tap room\".  Talking of which they do have a great selection of local and craft beers but if like me you're not a fan of domestic and prefer say British ales you're simply out of luck. I ordered a \"short\" draft (10oz?) of Stella lager. It took half an hour to bake the pizza and I ordered a second beer I should have checked the price , $6.50 each, $13 for a pint of Stella? Ripoff We got a 8\" roasted veggie and an Updike ($10-11 each) passable, no better and small, too small to share.   A mediocre Matthews lunch experience at Ballantyne prices."}
{"text":"Food was average, not the best choices for pizza. Don't order the large pizza it's cheaper to get two 8\" instead of one 16\". Still can't figure that one out. Staff was friendly. Be prepared for a family of 4 to have a bill over $50."}
{"text":"Bad customer service! We went for the first time for lunch and the server was very nice but we complained for having rotting lettuce in our salad and the manager came over and was super condescending. He said they looked at it and said they didn't see an issue and then apologized, won't be going back! The manager's name was Jason."}
{"text":"They tell you it is a 5-10 minute wait on the phone they you get there 5 minutes later and they say 45 minutes. After waiting an hour you get a crappy table slow service and cold food. Ruined the night. No thanks"}
{"text":"Loved their pizza so we were excited to find one closer to us. We ordered the positive friction but we got a cheese pizza. While cheese is usually required for most pizzas all the toppings that came with it were missing, including the pesto sauce, feta, and tomatoes. I like eating local pizza but this is the second time we have had a pizza that is extensively lacking. Interestingly enough there was a French fry in the box that we didn't order."}
{"text":"Very nice experience; excellent house salad, friendly, efficient service, not expensive. Overall a good value."}
{"text":"Disappointed.. probably the worst pizza crust I've had in my life. Maybe it was an off night. MOD pizza is so much cheaper, quicker and better tasting.."}
{"text":"First, I would like to congratulate The Pizza Peel on opening their third location in Downtown Matthews. Such a cute area. I live near Lake Wylie, so this was a hike for me. But I couldn't miss this event!  I had the honor of attending their Pre-Grand Opening, and my experience was great. Everyone had the opportunity to create their own pizza in the kitchen! I invited a friend who happens to be a chef! Talk about an unfair advantage! I hope she didn't win! hahaha! Just kidding! So the best pizza wins \"Pizza of the Month\" So cool right? 10% of each pie sold will support the charity of the winner's choice. I choose \"The Big Brother, Big Sister\" Program. Before moving to the East coast, my father volunteered with this program when I was a kid. So it holds a special place in my heart. I don't believe I won the contest, poo! hahaha!  I'm obsessed with the new location! I love the layout and the wall wood paneling! The dining room is open and welcoming.  Apparently, this used to be a coffee shop.   FOOD!!! Everything was great! We started with a combination of appetizers, which included: Pizza Fries Truffle fries Buffalo wings (my favorite)  Hummus Plate Fried Pickles   Entrees!! We had the chance to create our own 8inch pizza and name it! Mines the \"Pardon my crust\" contained pesto base, mozzarella cheese, red onion, roasted garlic, spinach, and prosciutto. Best pizza I've EVER made! My husband loved it! I struggled with the dough, My pizza was in the shape of a heart.   Entrees: Bruschetta Burger The Basic Burger Mary B's Burger Also a few I cannot remember hahahaa!!  Overall, I had the best experience! Thank you to the owner Will Bigham, and everyone at the Pizza Peel for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"I was invited to a soft opening and cant say enough good things about the wait staff, beer selection, food, and outdoor seating.  This is easily the best restaurant in downtown Matthews."}
{"text":"Been to this peel location as well as the Cotswold and I think this one definitely takes the cake. Whilst it is definitely more family oriented than colwick, it is a great place to come with your buddies and grab a beer and pizza. Service is attentive and super friendly. 10/10"}
{"text":"Desperately need a hostess stand! My husband and I walked into this newly opened establishment excited for a fun night in a new restaurant. We barely got in  the door and were immediately pounced upon by three hostess and an older man who was an owner or manager.  Since it was Sat night we knew there would be a wait and spied a bar in the rear so we told them we would wait at the bar. They had  stopped us right in the doorway and began to take our information-following right behind us was a family. They were waiting pleasantly for us to finish and put their names in for a table. That was when the manager/owner rudely told us to move so the family could get inside. Mind you Pizza Peel stopped us, you know how long it takes to give your name, and the weather was in the 60's. Not our fault the staff told us to stand and wait-  This place was a kid haven, as was to be expected, casual, we didn't stay so I have no info. on food quality. Most new established restaurants bend over backwards with customer service-I guess they don't want our business."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good except that the sauce is not fresh and way too sweet tasting.   Service is ok.   We have been 2-3 times since this location was opened."}
{"text":"Good Food and Great beer selection!  Nice atmosphere and excellent service!  The restaurant location is great.  In the middle of downtown Matthews which is nice and cozy with several local tap rooms."}
