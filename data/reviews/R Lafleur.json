{"text":"This is a must stop joint to bring you back in time. The double volcano burger nice with spice but not over spiced it was perfect I also ordered a side the the Michigan sauce solo no fries it is super."}
{"text":"Slightly worse poutine than the Belle Pro near Rome,  but their prices are lower and they're open late."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Located right beside the Brossard Bus Terminus (Panama) it's the perfect place to go for a snack while waiting for the bus.  As a vegetarian, their tofu dogs are unbeatable as is their poutine.  

They are open super late weekdays and on weekends.  

Service is generally quick. I've order food for take out with only 15 minutes to spare before having to catch my bus.  

Been in once before when they refused to cook tofu dogs because they had cleaned the grill for the night and didn't want to make them for me. I think it was 11pm... Only negative experience I've ever had there."}
{"text":"I happen to think LaFleur makes the best \"Michigan\" sauce (which is basically a meat sauce with a high meat to sauce ratio). Slapping that on a steamed hotdog for \"un vrai hotdog michigan\" is the best thing. I also happen to like their poutine sauce, which seems like it's the same recipe they've been using forever, but it's a bit salty. Their fries are great on their own, though I especially like them with salt and vinegar. The classic \"steamie\" hotdogs are good too, they have a drier coleslaw mix than some other places. These items literally haven't changed at all to my recollection, which is really part of the charm. This is simple, inexpensive, nostalgic fare. 
Even though it's a tiny joint where you may have to wait in line for a while (usually there are only 2 people working at a time) it's worth it - no trip to the airport is complete without a meal from LaFleur afterward!"}
{"text":"Trapped in the Holiday Inn Express & Suites on a rainy Canada day, I struggled to find a decent dinner on Yelp. Coming up short, I decided to take a walk to the place I saw out of my hotel window. It ended up being a fast food joint of hotdogs and burgers, with poutine. I chose the poutine, being that it's Canada Day and all, and found it to be pretty similar to other poutines I've had, squeaky curds and all. The price was reasonable and service was friendly. The only seating areas are outside, with a standing bar inside."}
{"text":"this fast food restaurant is on a very small grass hill. i felt like i was in a parallel world and i felt very small. like a small man. i had several buses to catch and thankfully this place was nearby. i made it in time for my buses, i staved off a disaster in my professional life and i felt like it might be my last time in the suburbs. it's difficult to switch my accent between white and cringy black imitation white and i'm on the bus to change that."}
{"text":"Un arrêt rapide sur la route, j'ai commandé une poutine, un hot-dog rôti et une root beer.
Les frites de la poutine sont excellentes, bien cuite, le fromage en grain frais, mais la sauce était très fade, goûtait l'eau...
Bon hot-dog, condiments et saussice goûte frais.
Salubrité moyenne, pas de chaises pour manger à l'intérieur, juste un comptoir que les routiers habitués utilisent.
*Mise-à-jour: il y a plusieurs tables de picnic à l'extérieur, côté droit du restaurant."}
{"text":"2 Michigan's with cheese, fries and a bottle water $12.54 ouch served extremely quick."}
{"text":"Friendly and very fast service. The best poutine in Lachine! Make sure to ask for extra cheese."}
{"text":"Coming back from the airport from my vacation in April 2016, my friend who was giving me a lift back to my place and I decided to stop off her for something to eat.

This place is one of the fast food places that have the deep friend thick cut french fries which are not grocery store bought and like the thick fries your parents used to cut and make. I'm a fan of these types of fries. I prefer these types of fries over the fries from the 5 major Canadian fast food restaurants (McDonalds, Harveys, Wendys, Burger King, or A&W).

I really like \"Italian Poutines\" over \"regular\" Poutines so I opted for their \"Poutine with Michigan Sauce\". The Poutine with Michigan Sauce is basically french fries, a bolognaise  style sauce (meat based tomato sauce) and cheese curds. I found their \"Poutine with Michigan Sauce\" to be very good.

The negative thing about this place (provided that you like fast food) is that inside the restaurant, you eat at the counter (standing up). If you want to eat inside the restaurant (because of the weather), you eat standing up with your food at the counter. If the weather is nice, they have tables outside the restaurant. On the day that my friend and I was there, it was cold and raining so we ate standing up somewhat close to the cash register. There is ample free parking next to the restaurant.

I rank them 3.5 stars out of 5 and like my other reviews, because 0.5 star values are not possible, I rounded them up since I don't want to shortchange the establishment so you will see 4 stars (but I really rank them as 3.5 stars)"}
{"text":"The food here is legit.  Especially the poutine. Don't make the mistake over ordering like we did.  The large poutine is enough for a family of 4 to split."}
{"text":"Très proche de l'hôtel Holiday inn Express
Les frites maisons sont old school
Sas gras trans
Portion de frites très généreuse.  
Le hot-dog all dress a peu de saveur.  
Par contre un bon dépanneur a 1 minutes de marche de l'hôtel."}
