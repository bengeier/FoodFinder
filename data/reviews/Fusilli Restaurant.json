{"text":"It's a great little restaurant in corktown.  The owner is very friendly, and even though there was a very large group that took up the entire place except for the table my wife and I were at, he made sure to pay a lot of attention to us.    We split a pizza and a salmon fusilli, and they were both delicious. This is a great place for a date or for a quiet dinner.  I will go back again."}
{"text":"I don't know what restaurant the other reviewers ate at, but Fusilli barely deserves the 2 stars let alone 4!  We got take-out, 2 pasta dishes, both with a tomato sauce base. The sauce was not fresh (i.e. tasted as though it had been sitting around for several days), it was also sparse and not cooked long enough. I would expect food like this at a food court, not from a \"cozy and comfortable\" little restaurant on Queen Street charging premium prices.  Stay away and buy some Olivieri brand sauce at your local Loblaw's."}
{"text":"Cozy and charming Italian restaurant on Queen East.  I've eaten here a handful of times and had pasta each time so I can't comment on the pizzas.  The pastas are hearty and flavourful - much, much better than those served at Terroni.  Fusilli also gets mass points in my book for having very reasonably priced and drinkable house wines at around $20/bottle.  This is a family owned and operated restaurant by Giuseppe (sp?).  He give attentive service but be warned - if the restaurant is not too busy, he may sit down and join you for a bit.  Fine with us but may not be for everybody!  On busier nights, there are younger, less experienced servers who have  not yet mastered their craft so be prepared to ask for water and the bill more than once!"}
{"text":"I wanted this to be a good place, as I like the neighbourhood and the unpretentious vibe, but my meal was not very good at all.  First off, you know when you buy pre washed lettuce, and after a few days some of the leaves start to wilt and get slimy? Well, that's what they served me for my salad:  I would say 20% of the lettuce leaves had some wilting/slime.  I could hardly believe it.  Then I had the gnocchi, which I'm pretty sure were just some frozen commercial brand, thrown together with an uninteresting sauce, and a tiny handful of overly-charred eggplant.  Food court food, at best.  The dessert was fine, but just fine, nothing special.  My daughter's pasta was a little better, but I was so disappointed I'll never go back.  You can certainly get better Italian food for less money elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"Decent for a neighborhood spot.  A bit overpriced though, for two pastas and 3 glasses of wine.  $90 for a quite simple to make pasta...."}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful staff but the food is consistently subpar. As Corktown grows and attracts new restaurants and bars this place will become a relic. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"First experience there was really good - the owner/chef catered to us and we felt very welcomed, and the food was quite good and authentic southern Italian. The second time I took my parents and the service was awful - very slow, and the waitresses seemed aloof. Food was just okay this time. I suspect this was because the owner was not present."}
{"text":"I live in the area and have walked by this place many times, curious about how the food is.  At the start I was unimpressed because he service was slow, with not even water served. But throughout the meal I realized that the server was also the owner and short staffed - and when we spoke he was friendly and funny, so I appreciated that.  For appetizers my friend and I had the bruschetta and calamari. The bruschetta was unimpressive. The calamari was better - grilled, salted and put on top of a salad. Simple but decent.  I ordered the salami pizza (paesana). Thin crust pizza that was not bad and not incredible. The one thing I did really like was that it had thick slices of salami which I enjoyed.  My friend had the salmon fusilli, which I tried. The pasta was not home made which is disappointing because I think that any Italian restaurant hoping to be taken seriously will offer fresh made pasta. However, the sauce was quite good - large chunks of salmon, and a garlic rose sauce.   So if you live in the area I would say give it a whirl, know what you're in for, and try the salmon fusilli."}
{"text":"Great Italian food and decent service. I had the gnocchi. Other than being a bit on the salty side it was nice.  I was by myself and there was only one group in the restaurant. She hid me in the back so I wasn't able to watch the activity in the area. Perhaps, that was her plan as it is located in an undiscovered area of corktown which can sometimes be a bit dodgy. The server was friendly (but not overly) and attentive. I would give it another try."}
{"text":"What a nice small Italian restaurant.   Good food. Good wine. Super cute inside.  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"My friends and I were seated quickly on a weekday since we arrived early. The place is quite cozy, almost too tight in space. The server was quite pushy and seemed a bit impatient, odd considering how empty it was. No complimentary bread basket (isn't that weird?). The bruschetta is a joke and looks like something you would get at a diner - literally 2 tiny slices of baguette with tomatoes, onions, and olive oil. Not warm. The only saving grace is that the olive oil used is very good.   Two of my friends wanted to split a pasta dish - the restaurant was kind enough to serve that up in two plates. Very few places do this.   Overall the restaurant and the vibe feels very dated; the decor, food, and mindset are stuck in the 90s. Good for small groups and families. Skip this place and venture down to Canary or Distillery District for some real quality eats."}
{"text":"This is a really cute restaurant. It's really small and you need to book your reservation in advance or you won't be seated during the weekend dinner rush. I came here with some friends and they were really happy with their entrees. Neither of them have any food allergies.   I have two food allergies and was pretty disappointed with their selection. I am both gluten and lactose intolerant. The only thing I could order on their menu was a gluten free spaghetti pasta with either sausages or muscles and shrimp. I wasn't able to order any of the main dishes since they had dairy or gluten or both.   Our waitress was really nice and the bottle of wine that we all ordered to share was really good as well.  All over, I would give this restaurant three stars. I just wish they could better accommodate guests with food intolerances but I understand why they don't.  It's probably due to their small size. I think they had 5 or six tables.   This is a great restaurant for a nice cozy experience."}
{"text":"Have the tomato soup.  The pizza is really delish, too, but make sure you have the tomato soup.  This is a semi-upscale italian restaurant, but it's small and right before lunch it's pretty empty. The staff is very nice, the food is good and there are not many options for fine dining in the area, so if that's what you're looking for, this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Very small and home like. Food is authentic Italian and delicious. Owner is very friendly"}
{"text":"- great and authentic Italian food (at least I had the impression that it was authentic, but since I'm not all that knowledgeable about Italian food, maybe take that with a grain of salt) - nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"As I live in the Corktown area, this was one of the few options readily available to me. My friend and I dropped by on a cold winter night and I definitely had my reservations with the place as there was only one table that was occupied.   When seated, the owner said that he was going to serve us some bruschetta and we proceeded to order food (salmon pasta and pasta of the day) and drinks.   The service was mediocre and the food was worst. My pasta was overdone and the owner insisted that it was meant to be that way. Just a FYI, my friend's pasta was perfectly cooked. Either way, the food was bland, overpriced and a huge disappointment. When I asked for hot sauce, he said that it would ruin the flavour and served me Chinese chilli oil instead.  When the bill came, he charged us for the bruschetta ($5) which we did not order. It was positioned as a complimentary alternative to the usual bread basket.  Oh yeah, if you're British, he will call you Mr Bean and continue to do so all night.  I wont be back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a cozy feel. Brings a nice atmosphere of a small town Italian eatery tucked away somewhere. If I compare with the Italian food I had in Italy, this is  as authentic as it gets. Let's start with the most important thing.  Portions Pasta portions are just enough. Italian falls under the category of heavy food for me. Their portions may seem small but filling enough. I'm a big guy and my stomach bigger so I can attest. Pizza I would compare to a personal pan. Remember though, these are thin crust. You aren't eating bread.  Dishes recommendations:  -Salmon Fusilli is highly recommended. The pasta is al dente (cooked firm but not hard) and the garlic tomato sauce is delicious and flavourful but not overpowering a perfect compliment to the salmon. The sauce is a little watery which is great to mop up with a slice of bread they give you so you can enjoy to the last drop.  I suspect they use seafood brodo (soup stock/ broth) for the salmon fusili. The sauce is definitely different for the other pastas and it shows.  -Old fashioned stone baked pizza. Still sometimes it looks like an oddly shaped pizza with some slight char marks, but I digress. It does seem to enhance the homemade feel. =D Even more so similar to what I had in Italy.  Additional notes: The owner is a friendly guy, if he isn't busy try to chat him up. Lots of interesting stories from him.  Also, he is a fond wine lover so ask him for recommendations for the wine to go with your meal.  He carries some interesting imports from Italy and Portugal."}
{"text":"Cosy restaurant specializing in Southern Italian fare. The owner, Joe, is almost always there working hard to create a comfortable ambiance. Good neighbourhood joint. You can also get take-out for lunch.  Obligatory Title Pun: I pity the FU-- nevermind, this is impossible.  Menu Readability: Short and well spaced, with clear details on each dish.  Need to mention: Salmon fusilli is a must have.  What this place teaches me about myself: It's a wonder that I can still enjoy southern Italian cuisine in spite of my mob ties."}
{"text":"I love this place.  You feel like family every time.  They have great wine and great daily specials.  Food is always cooked perfect and portion size is just right. One of my favs is the salmon always cooked to perfection  Prices are very reasonable  I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"A great place to spend an evening.  Service with a smile and great Italian dishes.  If there is something you like that's not on the menu...just ask!  We are regulars to the restaurant and will continue to be so and introduce it to to our friends."}
