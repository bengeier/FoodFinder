{"text":"I love it! Friendly people and great coffee. I would recommend Cupz to anyone on campus."}
{"text":"I really like the drinks here, the chai is legit and they have this Prickly Pear iced tea that is amazing when they have it. Good place to chill out between classes but they shut down pretty early. Fulfills all the requirements of a coffee place."}
{"text":"Cupz has the best chai tea latte I have ever had! It is so rich and creamy. I have yet to find one better. The breakfast sandwiches are also delicious and not too expensive. The service is decent as well."}
{"text":"The only reason to go here is that it is close to ASU Tempe campus. I'd like to support a local company but the espresso here is always bitter and the coffee is quite watery. I have had to return several drinks and wanted to return others several other times. The prices are also slightly higher than others in the area. I am sure their business model is to supply employees at Fulton Center with their coffee and to sell flavored lattes that mask the taste of their coffee to ASU students on the way to class. What they have going is that the \"baristas\" are quite friendly,  and the place is kept clean, although one stray cockroach came in once and was chilling on one of the chairs. (I was told that it's never happened before--that might be true but the population of roaches outdoors in that area is quite high, if you've ever walked around at night)  I'd love to support a local coffee shop but there are so many better ones in Tempe that I'd rather go to like Cartel Coffee lab or 3 Roots that actually care about the quality of their coffee. If you are near campus and you need coffee, you are better off going to Charlie's in Hayden library, or even Starbucks at the Memorial Union.   This is not a place for coffee-lovers."}
{"text":"The most important part about coffee shops to me is that they have good black coffee. And their black coffee is delicious. I had the light roast this morning and it's so flavorful and not bitter at all. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Coffee was sub-par at best. I asked for 2 Splenda packets in my latte and the cashier refused to put them in my coffee and told me to do it myself. My friend asked for cream cheese with her bagel and when they told her they were out, she asked if they had peanut butter and they told her no and that she would \"just have to use butter.\" Service far below sub-par..."}
{"text":"I love their white coffee! Staff always remembers me and goes above and beyond for service. Best place for a quick coffee and their sandwiches are spot on!"}
{"text":"Cup   Z, as I like to call it, is one of the better places near campus to grab some coffee. Vinny is always entertaining to chat with when I'm still waking up, and I love that they have trivia up every day that gives you a chance to win free breakfast (which I have...a few times).   My favorite drink is an iced vanilla coffee with COFFEE ICE CUBES! its brilliant! the coffee doesn't get watered down and tastes consistent through the entire cup. I've had their ciders, lattes, and mocha drinks, and have never felt they tasted bad, if they did, I'm sure the staff would re-make them...  Now they have Gelato, which is also delicious and made locally, fresh everyday. It is also dangerous since I work within walking distance of this place. :)  Overall, the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is mellow. I've gone in a few times with my laptop and some reading material and never felt uncomfortable. I dig that they always try to remember their customers and treat them the way you should treat customers you want to return - which is one of the reasons I do, and often."}
{"text":"It's nothing special but offers a great alternative to the evil, corporate behemoth of Starbucks in Memorial Union.  There are plenty of little tables in the back to sit and enjoy your coffee, and I've had the cinnamon rolls and bran muffins.  Both definitely great with an iced latte in the summertime."}
{"text":"I try to buy local, like for real local. Not just a shop in my neighborhood, but something owned and operated by local folks. I don't always succeed, but it is always in consideration when I choose to put my money on the counter. As far as I know, this is a locally owned and operated coffee shop, and it is the closest alternative to Starbucks from my office. It has become a daily routine for me, though at first I was hesitant. The espresso has been inconsistent in the past and the prices seem just a little out of reach for my daily eats. But lately, I'm glad I persevered through ranging drink quality. I'm a fan of the people. They have a great breakfast sandwich and they work with my dairy free requests. They are also the only place within walking distance that carry a vegan/dairy free cookie. The morning crew is personable and warm. Lot's of energy and they have a good time. It is a good place to stop in the morning and start my day.  I think that is the best part of supporting local, getting to know the people in your neighborhood. Go in. Say \"Hi\" to Vinny. Try to guess the movie trivia."}
{"text":"Awesome tea and even better service! Perfect pit stop from the light rail to class"}
{"text":"It was always easy for me to stop by this coffee shop as it's near my workplace. I love the latte here. The coffee as such is very rich and creamy. I would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"When I was an ASU student, this was my go-to coffee joint! I LOVE the ice coffee and the coffee ice cubes! Just genius! But what's actually really ticked me off, since I moved back to the Tempe area to visit Cupz, is that they are only open during the week now! WTF?! So much for building your ASU alumni customer base, guys! I work normal hours now, so I don't have a 45-60 min gap in the middle of the day to come in and grab coffee. Open your doors back up on the weekend. For real!"}
{"text":"They make a strong Americano!  Really good choice if you like dark, bitter coffee.  The service is pretty fast, and the staff are polite and friendly.  Only negatives is that there isn't much seating available, so if its crowded and you want to study/work, you're out of luck.   There is some outside seating available, but its not really optimal for the summer!  Great place to grab a coffee and run, make sure to get a punch card since its a very conveniently located to ASU."}
{"text":"***** This is the worst coffee shop I have experienced by far!!! My Best buddy Mr. S who is probably reading this review (Hola Shashi!!) :) suggested this place since one of his buddies was raving about how good this place was, WRONG!!       The service is unfriendly and super slow. I ordered a simple 16oz Iced, Non-fat Caramel Macchiato and they instead made it with whole milk and denied It was whole. I was like SERIOUSLY this undeniably is Whole milk, the color, consistency and flavor was screaming out, \"Yes I'm whole milk!!\" :("}
{"text":"When they're open (I just wish that was more often!), this is easily my favorite place near campus to grab some coffee and work. They offer free refills on black coffee, which is the easiest way to win my heart and keep me from ever leaving. Baristas are always pretty chill and friendly. It's got a lively, hopping atmosphere, especially when school is in session. On principle, I wish they'd ditch the TV (though I'm a little hypocritical in saying that, as I definitely watched all of Elf here last December instead of writing my law school personal statement). Overall though, my only serious complaint is that the limited hours keep me from coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Thank you for a great coffee. For making the hot chocolate warm for my toddler. Will be back for sure!!! Very yummy. Good location. Nice atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for the muffins and tea when I'm on this side of campus. The service is always friendly. I also like their salads and hummus. I wasn't too impressed with the sandwich I got, but I only tried once. The coffee is pretty good, but I'm not too picky a The atmosphere is nice when it isn't too crowded."}
{"text":"Cupz probably got me through my last two years at ASU. A few times a week I went in there and got some primo coffee and sometimes a fabulous pumpkin spice muffin from some very nice staff. Super reasonably priced coffee and homemade breakfast sandwiches that are wonderful and customizable.   The coffee is way better than any of the cafes on campus and it's a great place to sit and do some reading or check emails. Small, but I never had a hard time finding somewhere to hang out.   The punch card is a great deal too. They give you a free coffee after you buy ten or so and they used to upgrade it to the biggest size for me!"}
{"text":"AMAZING little coffee shop. I've been coming here for years, I love the brown sugar syrup they have for their coffee. I really loved meeting the new owners last time I came in, so personable and friendly. Also, great breakfast sandwiches. All around great experience."}
{"text":"The worst coffee in the City of Tempe.  The full name of this place is \"Cupz: The Coffee Experience;\" are they kidding?  Whatever the heck that is supposed to mean, and whatever the coffee experience is supposed to be, this place is not it.  The coffee is watered down and the \"z\" in the name does not make this place urban or hip, it just makes it a lame attempt to be in tune with a younger generation."}
{"text":"So I stopped in on my way to class which was very convenient. I decided to get a hot hazelnut latte and it was delicious. I would definitely go back for that and it's my go to drink whenever I go in from now on. Service was quick and I got exactly what I asked for. Only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was under the assumption they had breakfast sandwiches AND muffins/danishes.. I went in and they only had one type of muffin. Some type of walnut muffin. The only other options were protein bars, cliff bars and bananas. I was looking forward to getting a danish but they had absolutely none. The case was pretty much empty with little to no selection. So hopefully next time I can get a danish. Overall though, at least my coffee was good. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I go nearly every morning, the staff is super friendly, the dark coffee is the best! Also addicted to their biscotti. They also have decent soup, salads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I'm all about supporting small businesses, especially when they are close to where I work, but when the customer service is awful, it's hard to go back. First experience, the guy at the register was very impatient with an elderly woman who was simply asking questions about the coffee and he spoke to her very rude tone. When it was my turn, he acted the same way even though I ordered my drink with no questions asked. Maybe he was having a bad day- I don't know. I have worked in the service industry so I am one of the few people who think about things like that (having a bad day, etc.) so i came back a few months later to see if it had changed. Nope. Same guy (either was a redhead or blonde) was rude when I ordered a hot green tea when they were out. My bad for ordering something they did not stock.   Anyways, sticking to Starbucks, Dutch Bros and other places where the employees always have smiles on their faces and at least pretend they don't hate their lives at work."}
{"text":"For starters, they have no rest room. Maybe that's not a big deal for some but if I'm drinking a big great tea, I prefer not to have to run down the street and through the crosswalk to the ASU building that has a restroom on the first floor. Ok, so someone decided that was ok and I guess there isn't much they can do about it. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and it was more than meh. Honestly, I think any fastfood restaurant would have done better. Dry english muffin with some eggs and cheese - no offering of fresh arugula or basil or spinach or anything to green it up. No sauce or spice of any kind."}
{"text":"Before my new world at ASU, I have never been in Cupz-even though it is located under the misters when I wait for the bus in Downtown Tempe area.  Although I think its lamesauce they have the soy 50 cents charge on drinks (or on the side), their sandwiches are microwave tastic, and I get a weird feeling the girls who work there may have a nickname for me (and it may not be flattering-although I have no idea what my appearence or mannerisms would have warranted this suspicion-unless it is simply girls being I don't want to work at all girls?), I simply cannot beat the fact I can walk from my office door, walk to this coffee bar, pay, get my drink and walk back with a few minutes to spare to sit on a park bench before heading back to my office in under 15 minutes.  Plus, they have the frequent reader card and I already received my free coffee!  I think under most circumstances, I would award this place a one or two star for not having anything I would or want to eat, zero ambiance, zero bathrooms, but their okay priced soy cafe mochas, the one dude who looks like my friend Brandon from U-Mass, punch card and proximity makes them three-starable.  If only I could shake off my paranoia...."}
{"text":"I've given Cupz a few tries, and then another one when I said I wouldn't go back. They have a nice staff and their food tastes good. However, their drinks are awful. They are supposed to be \"the coffee experience\" but I could get an equally terrible cup of coffee at a gas station, and pay less. I'm disappointed their coffee is so bad because they are conveniently close to the ASU campus and they have a nice environment. They need to figure out a new method of making drinks."}
{"text":"\"One Sorority Special!\"  This is what the lanky barista announced as he handed me my sugar-free vanilla latte.  His humor was, without a doubt, the best part of the Cupz experience.    The espresso ranges anywhere from average to mud, but I've never had what I would call a good drink here.  This is all the more annoying when you remember that Cupz is generally a bit *more* expensive than Starbucks.  This place remains in business for one reason:  ASU is huge and people get sick of waiting in line at Starbucks."}
{"text":"Okay, Let me start off by saying that this place is great- When they actually have stuff in stock.    Seriously, I come maybe twice a week and it is always a struggle to see what they still have to offer.  Again today, I came at 10:30 am and they were out of bagels, croissants, orange juice, and no soup.  I ordered a breakfast sandwich that I didn't really want on en english muffin *the only thing except toast that was left, and I sat down to do some work.  Over and Over again, I heard the staff say- Sorry, we are out of it, no we dont have any left, sorry no more left.   This has happened numerous times.  The staff is supper friendly even though the owner doesn't seem to stock his shelves.   The only reason I come back is because they have a really good vanilla chai latte and it's right by my parking structure.    Stock your cafe properly and I will give 4 or 5 stars.  Oh, as I sit here and write- one more- \"We are out of that today\" :("}
{"text":"I stopped in here on my way to my office to grab a quick breakfast.  A huge positive is that there was NOT LINE just before 8:00 AM.  I can never grab something quick from any Starbucks, so this was amazing to me!  I grabbed a blueberry muffin to go ($3), as I already had my own coffee.  The muffin tasted fresh & was huge.  I'm still full 3 hours later!  I'll definitely be back in sometime to try coffee...although the reviews don't seem to be the greatest!  A definite try if you need a quick breakfast!"}
{"text":"Overall, Cupz is a great local coffee shop! Their prices are reasonable and the location is perfect, again, for being local!   Perks: *The breakfast sandwiches! CUPZ me up with those suckers! They taste fresh and homemade! Furthermore, you can customize your sandwich with the carb (I prefer an English Muffin), egg, meat (bacon, duh?! But occasionally a sausage patty), and cheese (they have a ghost pepper cheese that makes me sweat off all the calories from the sandwich, and if they ever get rid of this cheese, their star ranking from me will go down. Without. A. Doubt.)   *Their iced coffee is served with frozen iced coffee cubes! YUM CENTRAL   *Also, they have a punch card, where after 10 drinks, your 11th is free. This is rare these days and one cannot help but appreciate that. Especially for a local place.   Eh's (or cons): *Their espresso is okay... it's not toasty or bold. Not flat and flavorless. It just tastes like a mild coffee. Which is fine. I just prefer a bolder espresso. This is just my opinion - and I know others will disagree. I still love it, I just don't seek it out.  *Parking around here stinks, but we are in downtown Tempe, so you give some, and you win some.   Overall, check this place out - at the very least for a delish customized breakfast sandwich with a side off coffee ice cubes!"}
{"text":"I love that it has wifi (it's own, not ASU's). I'm not often on this side of campus, but when I am, I definitely try to head over there. I love the coffee ice cubes - really cool idea. Haven't tried the food there, but their tea is good and so is their coffee. They've got a lot of different syrup flavors for lattes, and I actually really liked the regular iced coffee I got. I'm not usually a regular coffee drinker (more into espresso drinks), so I was somewhat pleasantly surprised by that. The staff is friendly and helpful. I'll definitely be going back, as I also want to try some of their food now."}
{"text":"This place isn't trying to be hippie or hipster.  The place is clean.  Almost too clean, but despite that I like the place.  Their coffee is way better than anything Starbucks could aspire to but my preference is their selection of teas.  Strong, hot, loose and full of energy and flavor.  I can't say anything spectacular about their sandwiches. I've only had a breakfast sandwich there once and I was not impressed.  The muffins are good but my favorite would be the Eclairs.  Though they used to replace them every day and I'm not sure that's still the case.  It's not the best coffee I've ever had.  It's not a particularly unique coffee experience, but it's still a decent cuppa at a somewhat reasonable price and best of all it's not Starbucks."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a great change from Starbucks and Einstein's. In fact,  most days I like cupz better.  Their breakfast sandwhiches are delicious and really filling.  As for the coffee I can never go wrong with grabbing a mocha.  Probably the best coffee they make.  I don't go very often because I'm on budget,  but I do go when I get the extra cash because I like the pricing and fill up my punch card.  Staff is friendly and as long as you don't go at the super crazy coffee rush you'll get your order pretty fast."}
{"text":"A really decent option but unluckily to off the road and their closing times are not in my weird schedule. Their coffee tastes good and they have good suggestions."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's next to the University and it's got cheap food.  I usually order the breakfast sandwich (a sausage, egg between a bagel) and a cup of coffee or tea. I try to reuse a cup from an earlier purchase (I've rinsed it out) or bring my own. I usually walk out 3-4 dollars 'poorer'.  Ok, the food isn't great and probably has things in it I wouldn't want to know about and the coffee isn't top of the line or aromatic, but the atmosphere is nice. It's laid back, don't expect groveling the people working here are students and they're here between classes and having as much of a life as possible. Again, what I really like about this place is the prices and the fact that when I ask for water, they don't mind giving me ice water, we live in the desert."}
{"text":"There coffee is indeed good.  Don't count on using their wi-fi though... it sucks.  When it is working, rarely it is completely unusable.  Here's a thought, invest $30 dollars in your business and get a half-decent wi-fi router with 802.11N support.    C'mon!"}
{"text":"Great gelato. Friendly staff. Cozy restaurant. Close to ASU. It's my post-Subway dessert fix."}
{"text":"Was on ASU main campus and wanted a quick nibble and drink... The line at Einstein was super long so I figured I would make my way to College Ave. I had always seen Cupz but never went in... The line was quick and the guys who were working were very nice... I ordered a hot cinnamon apple cider and a breakfast sandwich... With ham and cheese on a Parmesan Asiago bagel... The cider was okay, I liked it because it was nice and hot, for the chilly morning... The sanny really surprised me because it was good; very flavorful and the bagel was yummy...  I'll pop back in again soon to try some coffee"}
{"text":"Friendly people, reasonable prices, but I prefer to have my morning latte WITHOUT drowned cockroaches, thanks.   This happened to my coworker this week. She got halfway through her morning coffee when she noticed a dead cockroach floating to the surface. She immediately took it back to the store, where they thought the incident was FUNNY, and the only thing they offered her was 2 coupons.  They did not even APOLOGIZE or state anything like \"this has never happened before!\" or \"We are shocked!\" or \"We are going to clean and double check everything right away\".   I love supporting independent coffee houses, but with a situation like this being handled with such a flippant attitude, I will be going to the nearest Starbucks instead of Cupz from now on."}
{"text":"It looked just kitschy enough to be an above-average brew, but fell flat on all levels. I ordered an iced soy latte...and, well, I'm not entirely sure they know what a latte is. I was expecting a couple shots of espresso with some soy milk (and okay, a dash of flavored syrup) thrown in.   I ended up with a gigantic, tasteless mess. Couldn't decipher whatever flavor it was supposed to be. It was like watered-down coffee thinned out even more by my beloved dairy substitute. This is what happens when you focus on quantity over quality...you get a 20+ oz. cup of very forgettable coffee-flavored water. I'd prefer my caffeine come in more...uh, concentrated packages if it's going to be so disappointing.    At least there appears to be a variety of hot sandwiches made-to-order. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and hope they deliver on that, because this road doesn't seem to favorable to the early birds of Tempe campus. Please practice hard at being good baristas, I don't want to see you lose every customer to the Memorial Union!"}
{"text":"The barista was very friendly and did a great job of making me feel welcome, but the coffee wasn't anything to write home about. Judging by the atmosphere and what I taxed in the drink, the brew isn't their main focus. It appears that the main mission of the establishment is to provide students with another shop to hang out at while doing work, with drinks and food items available for purchase.  There wasn't anything signature or standout to me during my visit, so it's difficult to say what separates this place from the other cafes."}
{"text":"The service is terrible!  I asked for a large cup of water and was not given one and the reply was only the small water cups were available. Do not get the large coffee because it will leak from the bottom. My second time going in and it leaked again. Poor customer service for food and terrible cops when your name is cup Z."}
{"text":"I park in fulton and my morning class is on the west side if campus. It's too convenient too stop in Cupz when I get to school. Better coffee, better price, better location than Starbucks. And they have those punch cards so if you get coffee regularly, at least you'll get something out of it!"}
{"text":"I used to come to CupZ pretty often for the breakfast sandwiches. Not because they were special or anything but because it was really cheap. I rarely got their drinks because the chai was too sweet and I could get coffee closer to my office if I want coffee. They run out of certain types of bagels really early which is annoying and they also change their hours often which was one of the reasons I stopped going. A couple weeks ago I decided I'd stop there for breakfast, since I couldn't eat at home and that, I have to say, is the last time I'll be going to Cupz. The picture says it all. The price of the sandwich increased and this is what it looks like. You gotta be kidding me. Hahahahahahaha. That sandwich really is a joke."}
{"text":"You'll get a cup of coffee and a cookie at a very decent price. They have the nicest staff and I have seen the manager couple of times. They are super friendly and positive. I have even seen Michael Crow buying his coffee from here.  Support the local business!"}
{"text":"I went in today at around 4:50 and the door was unlocked. When I got inside one of the workers abruptly said that they were closed, even though the sign outside said that they closed at 5:00 pm. I understand it was close to closing time but the worker was rude and they looked as if they had shut down the place far before I even got there."}
{"text":"They recently switched up the zucchini bread here. It used to taste homemade, as if Ina Garten had ribboned the zucchini herself. Now they sell mass-produced zucchini bread from Fry's, or something like it. The bread tastes like sponge cake; there are no more walnuts or zucchini bits or carrot flecks. Just the dew of canola oil. Disappointing because that original zucchini bread was really the only reason I ever went to CUPZ."}
{"text":"I like the coffee here.   I especially enjoy the fact that the atmosphere is cheerful without feeling like I am getting a \"Corporate Inspired\" greeting.  Oddly enough, that matters only when you get a chance to notice the difference--but when you experience both, the corporate-type greeting seems hollow and a little sad... Anyhow, I've only sampled the coffee and their huge, delicious, Bear Claw.  A-Ok in my book. I'll let you know how the other stuff tastes as soon as I try it.  The breakfast sandwiches look and smell amazing."}
{"text":"The best coffee in my opinion at reasonable prices. The staff there is extremely nice and upbeat, even giving me my meal for free once when my debit card expired and didnt work. Very nice atmosphere with a comfortable seating areas. I get genuinely dissapointed when I have to get coffee anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go while waiting for class for me, it's a very calm environment. The staff are insanely sweet every time I go. I wasn't a huge fan of their loose leaf tea when I got it a couple months ago, but I'm very picky about my tea and have yet to find a place to please me. Their cappuccino is good. They have gluten free and non dairy options available as well which is very nice. Their hummus with veggies is a very good portion for 3.99 as well. Will continue to stop by here to relax!"}
