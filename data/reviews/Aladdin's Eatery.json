{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service, and quality food at a great price. I know this sounds really gimmicky, but I'm a real customer. I'm just getting straight to the point!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian and non-vegetarian options! I usually get the falafel/hummus wrap -- always delicious! Both dine in and carry out are quick!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the dove is not working. we want to try curry pizza. however, the pita is also very good"}
{"text":"Very mixed review.   First, the menu turns me on. I love Mideastern food, and especially love Mideastern vegetarian fare. The menu has tons of things I love to eat, so I have lots and lots of reasons to go back. My boy friend is just opening up to the cuisine, and I really hoped this place would wow him. It could have, but instead just - ummm - \"not bad\"-ed him. More on that soon.  The service was great. For a casual place, way out of the park. The waitress was on spot from the get go. Loved her. When the boy friend spilled an entire iced tea, her coworker came running to help and they both smoothed it over and cleaned up the mess. They even let him have another tea, even though I voted to cut him off since he'd clearly had enough.  So why three stars? Some real bizarreness on their part.   We both had soups, which we loved. I had a wrap, which was great. The hot stuff hot, the cold stuff cold, and everything delicious. He had a sampler with salad, rice, and three kinds of grilled meat. Which was great, except the rice was cold. Not warm, cold. Like grandma sat it outside in the snow cold. He immediately let her know, no problem she'll get hot rice. They just made it fresh. She just as quickly came back and said they would have to microwave it, there would be no fresh order of rice. He wasn't into the idea of microwaved salad and meat, nor the idea of someone picking his plate apart for him to microwave rice, which doesn't taste the best microwaved anyhow. He said never mind forget it. She wasn't liking that idea, kudos to her. She went to the kitchen and got a manager to pry the rice away from whoever was being so cranky about it, and brought it out a few minutes later.  Yay! Fresh, cold rice.   No joke, after she went to all that work to make his order perfect, they sent out cold rice a second time. He wasn't eating it so I stuck my finger in it to see - yeah, about the temperature of my carrot juice. Cool. Not warm. Not very appetizing, and not even a safe temperature to keep food.   Silly thing to get wrong twice, I think. So aside from that, I was very, very happy with the place, and want to go back. I hope they'll earn back that last star."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the Aladdin's on McKnight Rd.   One day I ordered all this stuff. I was really pumped to get it and I live far away from the place. Of course they're not going to deliver it so I drive all the way out there. Again, in my excitement I pick up the stuff and put it in my car. I'm trying to hurry home and it eat it, mainly because I'm excited. And the person I'm with is excited too. We both were - because we know how good Aladdin's can be.   And then we got home.  And there was like one piece of meat all crumpled up like someone stuffed it in there without a second thought. C'mon man. I'm not a 75 lb. child. I need something larger than the size of one golf ball. And what about our other food? It was dry like sand and not worth eating. NOT THE STUFF I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO.  In the end, my excitement was all for naught. I wasted all that time driving to this place that prides itself on being called an eatery. Pick up a Pez dispenser or some tic-tacs, you'll get more of a meal out of them than a beef kabibby from this joint."}
{"text":"Best place for a filling, healthy meal but leaves you feeling clean inside! When we go out to eat but don't know where to go, this is our go-to! I can't get enough of their baba falafel pita! Don't forget the hot sauce if you like an extra kick!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite restaurants - I love their lentil soup with cheddar cheese and their fallafal rolled.  Hummos and Brewed Mint tea are MUST- Haves!  If I lived close by, I would dine here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here on Friday and was pleased as usual.  I truly love the fact that this restaurant labels each dish as vegetarian or vegan, not simply vegetarian.  I always get the hummus and veggie side platter.  The veggie side platter is huge and inexpensive.  I don't know of another restaurant (perhaps Pitaland) where you can buy a big, beautiful plate of fresh, unadulterated veggies.  I noticed that they have wine and beer.  I will definitely add this restaurant to my list of favorite dinner places as well.  Great job!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. My wife and I were looking for vegetarian options in our neighborhood and we were favorably impressed. It was also past nine when we got there, and we weren't the only people. I like it when places are open late.  We each had a glass of the Lebanese table wine, and we tried both white and red. They were lighter tasting than, say, CA wine, but very flavorful and drinkable. They're not served in actual wine glasses and I'm embarassed to say I got some up my nose when I tried to smell the wine :)  We split a falafel salad plate and a mojadarah plate. Now, these are both things we can make at home (in the case of falafel, with considerable effort and bother), but I thought Aladdin's did a good job on these basic dishes. The baked onions on top of the mojadarah were a lot better than I can do, and the falafel didn't have any of the typical pitfalls (well cooked, neither dry nor greasy). The falafel is fried in peanut oil, which I liked. It tastes different from grapeseed (lighter) and I might switch over to that if I ever make falafel again at home.  We barely finished both plates. Portions were generous and if we hadn't been so hungry we might have taken some home. I wasn't crazy about the pita bread and we didn't eat more than a bite or two of that, but we finished off everything else. The garnishes were very good. In particular, the lebanese salad garnishing the mojadarah really improved the dish--it added a nice bit of acid, and we gobbled it up.  The atmosphere is diner-ish but there are tables where you can sit outside. We'll definitely be going back when we want a cheapish veggie meal and are too lazy to cook.  This would be a good place for groups--low stress environment to sit and chat a while with dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great food and healthy too.  A great variety of choices on the menu."}
{"text":"I was on a business trip in Cleveland area last week and my team suggested we have lunch here. Initially, I was a bit hesitant because I have been spoiled by the fantastic Middle Eastern restaurants and cafes in the Bay Area but figured..what the hell.... Let's just say I was very pleasantly surprised. I ordered the lentil and potato soup (yummmmmmy) and a falafel pocket which was tasty and HUGE. The other people at my table were very happy with their meals as well.  The restaurant was nice and clean and the service was pretty good. I was a bit annoyed because my water was not refilled but aside from that, everything else was very good."}
{"text":"Had the sfiha for the first time and loved it! Also enjoyed the falafel salad and the hummus is always delicious!!"}
{"text":"Very glad I found this place. First off, we got a free hummus plate just for checking in (even though we didn't end up spending the $25 required to receive the offer). We got a raspberry smoothie and their \"comfort drink\" (mint tea).  Hummus plate was very creamy and tasty. Entrees, the chicken salad and chicken Schwarma were equally delicious, haven't had better seasoned chicken in quite a while.   Will definitely be returning to this quiet, affordable, friendly place and hopefully indulge in their mouth watering deserts!"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Aladdin's for many years.  The first time was in Mayfield, on the east side.  We later moved to Lakewood and we were able to enjoy the awesome food again!  Most recently we were so happy when they opened in Amherst (our current location) but the restaurant didn't take off here.  I'm not sure why, but I'm guessing it was the location and the fact that people were reluctant to try something new.  The only good news is that they opened a new restaurant in Oberlin, which is not that far away.  I'm actually almost addicted to the food.  There are so many things we love it would take too long to name them.  The hummus with the Hot Sauce is killer!  Also, love love love the Shishkabob Salad with the Sweet Tangy Tomato dressing.  I would strongly urge you to give it a try."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious.   Ordered the all alladin combo.   I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I love it here!  It is very affordable and great tasting!!  My favorite is the rolled falafel for about $5, but I've enjoyed everything I've ordered from there especially their salads"}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and on a diet to lose weight, and I seriously love Aladdin's! There are so many good soups, salads, and pita pockets that are both vegetarian and diet friendly! My favorite meals are the Mujaddara Pocket or the Fatayer and Lentil Soup! The only annoying thing is they pre-make their tabbouli so that the oil is already added into their salads, which are highly caloric!!! If you're not on a diet, however, the baklava is sinfully delicious and you would never be unhappy having a meal here! There's so many options and you could go there day after day without getting tired of the food. :) The best service is the Aladdin's in Fox Chapel."}
{"text":"The food here is great . I always get a chicken salade . Very big and a lot of yummy chicken! It fills me up and I leave happy . I'll be back again next week for another salade and hummus!!"}
{"text":"At aladdins being served by a waitress named jasmin.   Super sweet girl who looks like the jasmin in the Disney movie.  Haha  she did a great job.   Food was good.  Only drawback is that pita bread and hummus is not complimentary with every meal."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Middle Eastern food, and this was nearby so I decided to try it out. The food itself and ingredients were very good. Everything had a nice fresh taste to it, especially the salad.   The staff was very nice, and they got the order out in good time.  I would strongly recommend getting the house salad sauce. It was a nice balance of olive oil, mint, and all the right herbs. It went perfectly with the salad and any remaining pita bread.   The falafels were not the best, but it was definitely one of the better falafels I've had in Cleveland. I know many people liked the yogurt sauce, but I really did not care for it. The hummus was good, again I've had better -- maybe I'm just used to how Israelis make it; it had an interesting aftertaste that was not the most pleasant. In contrast, I really loved the Baba. The tabbouleh had a really fantastic fresh taste to it; I just wished that the different foods in the appetizer combo would be better separated.  The food is nice, but I disagree with the current rating of it only being a \"$\" restaurant. The dish prices can add up really quickly. The main dishes are all about 10 dollars and up. If you're looking for something a bit more wholesome than say cheap Chinese food, then this is a really good option."}
{"text":"Healthy and  delicious! Go tos-Chicken hummus plate with the hot sauce, and the pickled veggies with hummus"}
{"text":"I haven't lived in Ohio for 4 years now but STILL crave Aladdin's! I have not been able to find a counterpart in Colorado. I visit Aladdin's every time I visit Cleveland and order multiple dishes.  When I lived in Lakewood I ordered take away at least once a week. everything is so good."}
{"text":"A good place to grab a bite for lunch. They really have a baba to die for. Try their gyros and alladin style wraps."}
{"text":"Before I go into why I'm giving this place 3 stars, let me point out that you will not be disappointed with the food. It is, by far, the tastiest and subtle Mediterranean food I've eaten bar none.   The service, otoh, is mediocre and so the 3 stars. I got to the restaurant around 1:30 and was going to eat alone. The place was mostly empty with a few parties halfway through their meals. The host unceremoniously dumped me into a back table behind a glass wall without so much as asking if I wanted to be seated at one of the other available tables near the window. I get that I'm no eye candy :) but I love sitting at windows to people watch too!!  Then, my waiter was didn't even ask me if wanted to order. I had to tell him what I was having as an appetizer (a yum carrot/banana smoothie.) After bringing me the smoothie, he disappeared for about 5-6 minutes without giving me a chance to order the main course.   I sat there twiddling my thumbs and was midway through my smoothie before he reappeared to take my order. In the meanwhile, I pretended not to be able to hear the conversation at the table next to mine. I ordered a pita roll which was fantastic.   After finishing the pita roll, I again sat around desperately trying to find something to do on my cellphone while waiting for the waiter to clear the table and get me my check. After I paid up, he again took his own sweet time coming back with the credit card bill for me to sign.   I must say that the other wait staff seemed a lot more prompt with their service. My guy didn't make any effort to make me feel welcome or make small talk seeing how I was sitting alone.  Anyway, if you're going there for the food, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review before I eat - looking thru the menu, the Japanese call this \"omakase\" - like \"ohmygosh\" - when there are no wrong answers, everything is incredible, so you  say \"screw it, you order!\"  Hummus with hot sauce, pockets with everything - vegan Lebanese - incredible."}
{"text":"Every year I visit, I must stop in at Aladdin's to get a whisper of food that is lost in a sea of apple bees and Burger King. First, the kibbie is to die for, slop some Greek yogurt on it for some balance action, also enjoy with the cucumber salad. Next I savor the honey Dijon mustard wrap, I think it's called Aladdin. The chicken is seared with the right amount of spices and opens your senses. They wrap it in thick warm pita bread with all the mustard you could dream too! For dessert I usually take mine to the hotel, but you pick out a beautiful slice of cake. The choices seem endless and all of them were made with care and effort. Yes, I can't resist this joint, and recommend to anyone trying to spice up there day, because when you eat there you feel like you just did a cake walk. Bon apatite!"}
{"text":"The place was full when we went! Good food. Nice ambience. Staff wad helpful. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I like their pitza, but I usually go with the falafel salad."}
{"text":"Quiet, pleasant atmosphere with delicious food at excellent prices.  The jasmine rice was the favorite for my table."}
{"text":"We have going to the location in Hudson for years and the Cuyahoga Falls location is even better. Service  and food are perfect.  If you can't decide, try the Flavor Savor Special. Big size, good variety, and priced well. You also can't go wrong with any of their desserts."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is my go-to place in squirrel hill, it's fabulous! They have so many amazing vegan options to choose from. Make sure to always go with an order of the hummus to start - it's the best i've had anywhere, and they give you a HUGE plate of it. The falafel is delicious; crunchy but smooth and just the right amount of spice. The dawali (grape leaves) are tangy with a perfect texture and are definitely a staple for me whenever I come here. You can taste how fresh all of the salads and soups are, and no matter what my hunger level is I can always find something to satisfy it. Pro tip: get a side of the hot sauce with EVERYTHING, not sure what's in it but it's the perfect blend of flavors and goes great with the hummus. The prices are great and so is the service. Can't say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"As a vegan I eat at Aladdins regularly and am never disappointed.   Today, I was in a fix with a late minute take out order for a party and Mary went over and above her job to help me out with a container and serving spoon.  What a gem!  Aladdins is lucky to have her.  I love this place for its great food and exceptional service!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Cleveland! Delicious fresh food, relaxing atmosphere and the prices are fantastic! The Lakewood restaurant has the nicest servers, but I also like the one in Crocker and Middleburg Heights, too."}
{"text":"Excellent, just like the Lakewood shop. We had hummus with the hot sauce (so good), a shish kabob rolled pita, side salad (their salads are great), and a curry chicken rolled pita. Only complaints were very minor: the steak chunks in the kabob were kinda big, the salad was overflowing its small plate, and the banana peppers in the other pita were all on one end. But everything was delicious and perfectly toasted. Service was quick and fantastic too. They brought extra pita for the hummus and now we have a snack for home."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is awesome. The ambiance is totally like the disney film \"Aladdin\" with its huge middle eastern decor and mirrors. The colors work well too (red and gold).   I would recommend this location in Crocker park. Me and my best friend were looking for a place to eat in Crocker park, and we didnt want to go to an overly flamboyant location or one that would cost too much money. Viengs, which is next door, foodwise, is not as good. We decided on Aladdins, though we both hadn't been there often.  Sitting down, we were able to converse without having our voices echo throughout, even though the location wasn't that large. Our food was prepared quickly, and the server was really nice (and hot for that matter). For less that 10 bucks, I got a plate full of great food. And the best part...it tasted good. When I took a bite into my wrap of food (the contents of which I forget at the moment...lamb, corn, some secret sauce, rice, etc.) the flavors just burst. With the first bite. Like heaven. It was so good. Who knew?   Pleasantly surprised, I would give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"I can't help but wonder where the reviewers who call Aladdin's \"overpriced\" are dining instead.  The prices are very reasonable, even within Pittsburgh standards--the only things I'd consider splurgy at all are the smoothies / juices and the desserts.  The smoothies are worth it, at least, but the desserts can be hit or miss, depending on how long they taste like they've been sitting in the display case.  Every time I've been here, the service was at least adequate, but it's sometimes very good.  This place is also fantastic for vegetarian options, and tastes very fresh."}
{"text":"Friendly, attentive, staff with a huge and diverse menu. If you have any allergies or restrictive diets you will still be able to find something delicious here. I ordered the Lebanese white wine and the flavor savor special. Both amazing. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh I will make sure I come back!"}
{"text":"Love Aladdin's!  Great staff, cool decor and the food!  Took a chance and ordered something other than my usual falafel rolled and got the chicken curry rolled pita. Sooo good.  If you love hummus, get the hot sauce here too. It was so good, even my kids were scooping it up in the hummus.  This is the place if you want to walk out full and happy."}
{"text":"Typical for the Aladdin's chain.  The hummus at Aladdin's is amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. The consistency of quality, warm atmosphere and friendly faces will get you hooked. Love it and hope you stay around for a while."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this location.  My husband is trying to go vegan so I had to find somewhere for us to eat.  We were in the area so I suggested Aladdin's.  Glad I did because the food was great!  He had the Farmer's Pitza and was very satisfied with it.  The side salad that came with it was a big portion and was very fresh!  I had the Flavor Savor Plate and was also satisfied.  I couldn't eat all of it so I brought it home and it was still good hours later!  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Love this place! My wife and I tried the Mt. Lebanon location on a whim once and loved the experience! This location is slightly more convenient to get to and we always have a great time! Don't be put off by it being a franchise; the food is legit and there's something for everyone.  I always try a new meat dish and my wife always tries a vegan plate and we always leave with empty plates and full stomachs. The staff is particularly nice and accommodating and will help with suggestions. Make sure to take a dessert home!"}
{"text":"This may be my favorite place to eat. They have the best hummus ever. Paired with the fresh, warm pita, it can't be beat!   Even though I live closest to the Lakewood location I prefer the Crocker Park location becausa it is right across from Sephora!"}
{"text":"Amazing Lebanese food! I enjoy that they have a lot of healthy options and their portion sizes are just right."}
{"text":"They are very accommodating for vegans! I had a vegetarian combo platter, and sampled a few items. It was very delicious and filling. The portions are so generous that I was able to make two meals out of it. The food tastes fresh, flavorful, and homemade."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Middle East food the menu here will please you. Be careful of the hot sauce because it is quite hot. For vegetarians there are a variety of tasty dishes especially the chili soups. Be careful not to look at the beautiful cakes in the display as you will gain weight just looking. Can be quite crowded on weekends with long waits. Try the sampler plate to acquaint yourself with the foods they serve."}
{"text":"Start with a glass of Massaa Classic Red and have the vegetarian appetizer. Fantastic tuna roll pita. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's and have been visiting for years. Their soups are out of this world. I also highly recommend their smoothies and juices. I almost always order one of their salads because the ingredients are so fresh and tasty - I recommend the taza chicken salad. The pitas are good and the pitzas are as well. Overall a good place!"}
{"text":"I've been to most of the other locations & I love the atmosphere here at Crocker. Far better staffing than the middleburg location, Lakewood is too chaotic for my liking. I like that I don't have to ask for anything, like they're reading my mind!  Everything is so fresh & delicious. I'm ever so grateful they have gluten free options, it's hard enough eating out. You can only have so many salads :-) here there are so many options for me & vegetarians too."}
{"text":"Living in Baltimore, we have very few Middle Eastern restaurants, so I was happy to find this place on a visit to Mt. Lebo.  My first Middle Eastern food in what felt like forever!  I had the vegetarian sampler platter -- dolmades, hummus, falafel, and baba ghanoush, served with a stack of pita.  Everything was very fresh, and all of the bright herbal flavors that you expect of Middle Eastern food were there.  It was absolutely delicious, and enough food for two meals. (I ordered for carryout).  For dessert I had a wonderful little two- or three bite pastry....shredded wheat wrapped around a slightly-sweet bundle of pistachio nuts.  Not as sweet as baklava, but the server recommended it after I told her I can't eat walnuts.  My only suggestion?  For the vegetarian platter, a couple of kalamata olives and a few chunks of feta would have been a nice addition.  Otherwise it was a nice lunch, and well worth the price."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our supper at this place a lot. Nice ambience and outstanding food. Liked the service very much. Would definitely o to this place with friends again."}
{"text":"The employees didnt seem to know what they were doing. Missed part of our order, didnt refill drinks, and my food came out cold. The air conditioner on the ceiling was dripping onto all the tables near the window, including ours. The employees were all visibly gathered in the back just chatting instead of doing their jobs. I will not eat at an Aladdins again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I ordered the chicken Shawarma and it was very bland. Edible but not tasty at all."}
{"text":"Pretty good healthy wraps and salads for a chain store."}
{"text":"Nothing special. It's unauthentic middle eastern food. Have tasted much better in my own home and other restaurants. This is \"Americanized\" middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Good.  Lebanese.  Food.  I used to be a server at Aladdin's actually, and so I know the menu well...it is all very good.  If you have never been before, be sure to take your time with the menu because it is pretty lengthy!  Even though I no longer work there, I still get cravings, especially for the baba, falafel, and mujadara plate.  Delicious!  One of the most popular things is the hummus appetizer...be sure to get the hot sauce to go with it!  People love the hot sauce.  Be warned.  =) there is a display cooler of amazing cakes that greet you as soon as you walk in the door!  Each one is just so yummy!  The coconut cream is a personal favorite!  They also have take-out, outdoor seating, and a plethora of wines/beers."}
{"text":"Better than the one in Highland Square, but that's because it's newer. Pretty reliable decent food and service, and good value."}
{"text":"I luckily found Aladdins on Yelp.  Even though I have eaten at the Cincinnati location, I didn't make the connection until Delilah (awesome!) mentioned it as I was ordering.  Fantastic food and selection.  I had the vegetarian combo plate which was a a perfect sampling of all their favorites."}
{"text":"An okay place for Middle Eastern food.  It's not the best or most exciting I've ever had, and seems a little bland, but it's all right and good to have the option of Middle Eastern food close by.  I generally get carry-out when I am in town.  I like their appetizers best as they offer a variety of the things you'd expect like hummus, tabouleh, baba ghanoush, stuffed grape leaves etc. However, many of these items require pita bread to eat properly, and I can tell you when you get carry out they do NOT give you anywhere near enough pita bread, especially if you get the app sampler that has several.  I literally had to go out and buy more pita at the store to finish the leftovers the next day. It's disappointing especially given that this place is not cheap (a carryout app, entree and small dessert for 1 person costs me over 20 dollars).  Entrees are heavy on the \"rolled pita\" versions or the \"pitza\" versions of standard fare.  Since I'm not a member of the generation that wants everything served in pizza or burrito form, a little of that goes a long way.  The rolled pitas leak sauce like mad, so you have to use a fork anyway as if you try to eat it burrito style you will end up wearing half of it even if you are holding it in a wrapper. They do have some traditional style stuff served over rice and vermicelli but I'd prefer more of those selections and fewer of the rolls/ pitzas. As for dessert, they have good baklava but  most of the other options are Western desserts like cookies.  This makes me sad since I love me some Middle Eastern desserts and don't really need or want another place to get a brownie.    Overall, it's okay for a quick baba and baklava fix, but not a five star experience for me."}
{"text":"Their veggie platter is my fav specially the falafel. One of the few places in Pittsburgh with fresh juice which I love! Grape leaves are v ordinary, prefer the ones at kassabs. Love their yoghurt dip too!"}
{"text":"Quality is fine. Taste is terrible. At least for the items that I ordered. I had the hummus and the V-something soup. Hummus is nearly all tahini sauce. Cannot taste chickpeas at all. So if if you think hummus is synonymous with tahini sauce, that's the dish for you. This is not hummus, it is all fat and very bland. The V soup simply tasted like V8 canned juice. I know it was prepared fresh but the taste profile was atrocious. I love vegetables...this was one of the few times that I could not finish a plate of vegetables."}
{"text":"I was reluctant to try this place, but my wife was adamant that we should, so since I always listen to her, we tried it.  Great choice!  This place has a very extensive menu and a great atmosphere.  I had anticipated a cookie cutter chain establishment, and was impressed that it felt like a quaint neighborhood cafe.  We were seated immediately at 7 on a Friday night and the host was very friendly.  Our waitress, Sara was excellent, she was very pleasant and attentive.  We chose outdoor seating and it was very interesting watching this newly developed area and seeing what a great job former mayor Robart has done transforming the former blighted State Road Shopping Center into something spectacular.  The food was incredible, I had a combo plate with lamb and beef with rice and a salad, my wife had a delicious wrap. Portion sizes were large and we both left happy.  We will be back here and look forward to watching this area grow.  By the way, thanks Sara for your recommendations and your great service!"}
{"text":"It's great food. They have very few options for a celiac (gluten-free), but they are willing to accommodate and help you out."}
{"text":"Good middle eastern food.  Limited beverages.  Try many different items.  Have dessert."}
{"text":"My friend and I both ordered soup and drinks, today (05/24/2015). The waitress asked, \"Feta, or Cheddar?\" Both my friend and I naturally took this as an either choice, since being asked this way it is pretty clear one is included.   Well, when the bill showed up we found out that wasn't the case. We asked about it, and the waitstaff apologized then offered a comp and said they just needed inform the manager, Matt. This manager showed up a minute later and spoke condescendingly to us, treating us like some kind of joke, \"Yeah, we tell them to say it like that! ...Well, Every place I'VE been extras like that were CHARGED for.\" then he laughed after making an incredibly awkward situation in the middle of the restaurant, loudly, with other tables and other customers around. What kind of customer service is that? What could he possibly gain from this?   The food, the location, and the building itself were great. The manager acted like a total jerk to us in front of other customers in order to justify NOT giving the already offered comp, though. This was our first, and last time here. Again, we were offered, and then retracted, and then ridiculed over $1 in charges that we only asked about when they showed up on the $17 or so bill-because it was unexpected. We never even made any demands. We didn't even ask for comp.   I don't know if the other Aladdin's Eatery places are like this, but I'm not willing to take that risk after this experience..so I'll be staying clear of all of them now.                                                              DO NOT RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat if you're in the mood for light, healthy foods. I love the salad and hummus but not a big fan of the falafel. The service is kind of slow, but the people are very nice and the good food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I had tried this place when I first moved to Lakewood in '05 and I was hooked. It totally puts the Greek restaurants in Hawaii to shame. I moved back to Hawaii and when I came to visit last year I was shocked in how much the quality of the food had changed. It wasn't good at all. The hummus caused my mouth to break out in blisters and my meat in my shish kabob salad was dry. And the carrot cake that I ordered wasn't moist at all. I was heart broken.... they started to taste like the crap they serve in Hawaii. On the upside at least it's cheaper."}
{"text":"HUGE menu, something for everybody here. I almost always go for the rolls (the lamb rolled, in particular). They make for a cheap, fast lunch in the North Hills. If you go and have time to sit down, I highly recommend any of their phenomenal appetizers."}
{"text":"I usually like Aladdin's, but this one was awful! The 2 of us came later in the afternoon to get a quick meal. The waitress was newer and they gave her 6 tables. No one else was helping her. We waited 10-15 mins to be greeted. She got our order wrong and it took several times of her talking to us and then going back into the kitchen to figure it out. We had to eat our meals separately when the right order finally came out. Then we were charged for the correct AND wrong meal. She \"fixed\" it and ran our card but we were still charged for a side item we didn't order or get. Our quick meal was 1.5-2 hrs long and we had ordered the first time she came to the table. Wasted afternoon. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I am so lucky to have this place across the street from where I live. I love Lebanese food. The produce here is always fresh and delicious. PLUS, the service is consistently great. So many healthy choices, it's easy to stick to any weight loss program choosing from this menu. In fact, Aladdin's website provides a nutrition info sheet for all of its items which makes calorie counting easy. I really love Aladdins."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a disappointing experience at the Aladdin's in Cuyahoga Falls, but were hoping the Hudson location would be better since it's so close by. Our dinner last night was not just disappointing, it was inedible. We love Middle Eastern food, and are familiar with the spices, so that wasn't the issue. First, the bulgar in the tabouli was not cooked or softened, so each bite was crunchy and gritty. The waitress then informed us they were understaffed, so our food was going to take awhile. That wasn't good news. When the food finally arrived, after about a 25 minute wait, my beef kofta were charred black. They were so obviously burned, I  can't believe our server brought them out. My husband's  chicken and lamb were as tough as shoe leather. We looked around for a manager just as the couple at the table next to us called her over to complain about their burned food. When she came over to us, she apologized and said she'd get us new entrees and a gift card. I said we didn't want a gift card as we had no intention of ever coming back. We didn't want to pay for one I of the entrees. So another 20 minutes go by, and we still don't have our food. We finally got up and left. Definitely one of our worst restaurant experiences in our 40+ years, and we've eaten some strange things in foreign countries! Aladdin's should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is affordable, delicious, and has great portions.  Sometimes I just order the len-chili soup and split an order of hummus with a friend, and I'm totally satisfied.  The stuffed pita pockets are also a good choice. It's sort of overwhelming how much salad you get, but the food is always fresh and healthy.  When in doubt, I usually go to Aladdin's for a quick, health dinner."}
{"text":"As this is a small chain, my husband I weren't expecting much when we ate here.  The place is super casual, the menus look like chain restaurant menus, and the food is almost too affordable.  But, we arrived at our hotel down the street and thought we might be meeting with other people later that night and thus wanted a quick meal.  We hoped the food would at least be ok and ended up being shocked by how good the food was.  I had a falafel salad, and my husband had a falafel roll and a salad.  The server was always on top of taking care of us, filled our waters when needed, and even lowered a blind to prevent the sun from being in my eyes.  Now my only hope is that the chain will get so successful it will expand to New York State."}
{"text":"On a recent family visit to Pittsburgh, we ended up desperately needing to find food in the Mt. Lebanon area.  I know this is not the same location but how different can the food be for this kind of chain (although at the time of getting food there I did not realize this was a chain).  We got food to go so I can't comment on the service.  I don't recall exactly the names of things we got but I know that there was lentil soup (completely underwhelming, over-spiced with oregano??? but otherwise bland), grape leaf wraps (bland and boring), and two pitas...one with lamb the other a combo.  My husband's combo pita wrap was alright, nothing to write home about though.  My lamb wrap was good enough to eat when there were no other options but not flavorful enough for fond memories of a meal.  Basically, other no-so super Lebanese eateries could wipe the floor with Aladdin's food.  I will never go back and would not recommend unless you are desperate and want to avoid other questionable places like Ruby Tuesday, TGIF, etc or nasty fast food."}
{"text":"While returning from a family vacation in the Midwest, we stopped in Streetsboro, OH for the night. I used Yelp to look for nearby restaurants and found Aladdin's. Since, my family likes Middle Eastern food and I did not want to spend a lot, this seemed like a good choice.   Yelp reviews were right on with Aladdin's. My family enjoyed a delightful dinner there.  SERVICE: Waitress was cute, smart and attentive. She was very knowledgable of their extensive menu and provided good recommendations that we ordered including the Chicken Sambusek and Mediterranean Lamb. Service was prompt.  SETTING: We opted to eat on their outdoor patio and enjoyed the experience. It was a warm summer night and there was a good crowd and ambience. The setting was clean and simple.  FOOD: We ordered 3 dishes and shared this among 2 adults and 2 children. All plates were cleared when we were done. We enjoyed the lamb, kibbie, hummus, and chicken. Food was fresh and flavourful.  I have come to learn that Aladdin's is a middle eastern chain restaurant around the Midwest. It's good to see chain resaurant like Aladdin's that serves good tasting, healthy food, at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I've loved this place for years...but have noticed a decrease in the quality of its dishes. For instance, the veggie chili has been watered down--it's not as thick as it once was. Also portions have gotten smaller while prices  increased this year. Does anyone remember when pita was included with all take out orders? It's extra now. Boo.  UPDATE:  Sadly, had another so-so experience with take out. The Dawali Rolled pita was different---and not in a good way. Raw onions, dry as a board (no dressing)...what's going on over there guys? My husband's was prepared the same weird way. We both looked at each other during the second bite and exclaimed,\"Something's different. This doesn't taste the same!\" It's the little things in life that bring you down..."}
{"text":"We would eat here every day if we could. Everything on the menu looks yummy. I always have a hard time deciding what to order. Service is prompt, friendly, and attentive. Prices a little high, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Service was realllllllly sloooooooow. Came for lunch. An hour and a half later we left. Food was pretty good."}
{"text":"My family has been getting take-out from here for years and years (so often that when one of my friends that works there met my Dad, she went \"Oh he's that English guy that comes in all the time\". The food is always good. We've rarely had issues with mistakes in the order, and when we have they're quick to fix it and very nice about it. I don't know where they get their desserts, but sometimes we'll pick up a slice of cake to have after dinner, and... wow. The desserts are fantastic. I've only actually been in the restaurant to sit down and eat a handful of times, but when I have, I've received excellent service. The staff also seems to be treated well by management.   There's also lots of vegetarian and vegan options, which is great! I was a vegetarian for about 8 years and never felt that my choices were restricted.  Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed our meals here. My husband had jasmines favorite with the chicken tawook and I had the beef kabob platter with the brown rice with almonds. Both were great. The portions were smaller than the pictures on yelp suggest, but it was definitely enough to fill us.   Only a couple minor things that would have made this better. First, the food was a bit cold when it was brought out. Mine was ok (not great) but my husband sent his back to be warmed up which is very unusual for him. Second, we were both on the fence about trying a dessert and were going to ask about them but the waitress walked by and dropped our check off and kept walking without even asking if we wanted anything else. That made the decision for us since we didn't feel like waiting to flag her down so we left with no dessert. The cakes looked delicious though... maybe next time!"}
{"text":"I've definitely made my way around the menu here. The soups or chili are good, the salads are very fresh, the rolled pitas are my favorite, and the pita pizzas are also great. I've visited several different locations and service is consistently friendly and attentive. Prices are reasonable.   I know the desserts are a big hit with some people, but I don't like them. I've given them a couple of chances and found them to be dry or stale, with super-sweet frosting. That said, if you do like them, you will appreciate the large servings."}
{"text":"The felafel was very good, nice vegetarian options."}
{"text":"The food is good, but you don't get a full satisfying meal if all you order is an entree. I ordered the Lamb Salad, which was true to its name -- pieces of lamb and pieces of lettuce, plus 2 slices of tomato, 3 slices of cucumber, and 4 calamata olives. I was surprised it didn't have at least a dollop of hummus or yogurt on the side. I had considered getting one of the Speciality Plates, but the hummus one was similar -- the description said it came with hummus, tomato slices, and pita bread. Odd for an entree. I would expect that for an appetizer, but entrees I expect to have more variety. I don't see myself going back, unless it's specifically for appetizers. Too much money for a meh-meal."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!! Went for lunch with my wife on a Wednesday.  We sat at 12:25 PM.  We ordered the Kibbie and  two Chicken Salad Rolled Pitas.  We asked to have all of the food come out together as we were in a bit of a hurry.  We inquired about our food at 12:50 PM when we noticed guests seated after us were served some appetizers.  We also commented that the gentleman who was seated just before us finished his meal, paid, and had left the restaurant.  Our server mentioned that our food would take longer because we ordered food that had to be cooked.  We sat and sipped on our drinks until 1:10 PM and we could not take it anymore.  We asked for our food to go.  The hostess/manager apologized and offered to throw in desserts.  We declined the desserts, and she comped the Kibbie.  We waited another 10 minutes at the front door as our food was still not ready.  As we walked out the door the hostess/manager mentioned that a trainee was in the kitchen, and that was the reason for the delay.  It was a frustrating experience, and I will not go back.  You cannot have a weekday lunch go an hour without any food.  It is inexcusable."}
{"text":"I love Lebanese food and am so happy to have discovered Aladdin's in Mt. Lebanon. The service is prompt and the food is delicious. I was pleased to find a great vegetarian selection. I highly recommend the falafel wrap (the pickled turnips are a delightful bonus.) The baklava cheesecake is everything you'd hope it would be and more. The great staff, clean and casual dining atmosphere and excellent food have made this a Pittsburgh area staple for me."}
{"text":"My husband works near here and when I get to visit we often come here.  They have great prices for the quality and amount of food you get.  Last time I was there I got the tuna steak rolled...umm... just amazing! So delicious! Also got the pita with hot sauce.  Always a favorite. My husband got the chicken roll.  He's a picky guy but was so happy with his decision. After our meal we HAD to get a dessert.  They always have such a fantastic variety of desserts. I've tried cakes and cookies and everything else you could think of (and they were all delicious) but my favorite is still the baklava. Dripping with honey and always fresh.  There is nothing better! Love this place.  Love the staff and location."}
{"text":"Was disappointed in Aladdins before, but decided to give it a second chance and order takeout. We will no longer eat here, after we found a HAIR in the rice - quite disturbing."}
{"text":"Great light, healthy Mediterranean fare.  The appetizers alone are awesome, particularly the loubie bizet and the hummus. You cam get falafel as an appetizer or in various sandwiches or salads. There are a ton of vegetarian options. The mujadra plate is a favorite of mine. I also recommend the smoothies.   Everything is quite affordable except the dessert, which runs about $6 for a slice of cake. Two people can dine here and get an appetizer and beverages for around $20.  The service is generally pretty good as well.    If you're looking for a greasy, very filling meal, this isn't the place for you. But if you like Mediterranean, I highly recommend Aladdin's."}
{"text":"Fantastic eatery in Squirrel Hill. The hummus and pita here was absolutely phenomenal, and the best I've ever had in my life. For the main course, I had the chicken shawarma, which was also cooked to perfection. For my drink, I had the crazy berry smoothie, which was incredible. Overall one of my favorite restaurants I've ever been to, and I most certainly will be coming back here for a very long time."}
{"text":"Middle eastern food all seems so bland. And that is why I am drawn to it. I love that a lot of different dishes use similar ingredients and they are all so healthy. Seriously though, everything looks like a different shade of tan, or beige, or khaki mush so it surprises me that everyone seems to like it. This is the kind of place you can suggest to a large group of people who have little in common and everyone will agree to eat there, and they'll feel good about it."}
{"text":"Delicious. The Foule M Damas appetizer was out of this world! Also gotta recommend the hot sauce. And great desserts. I live in Boston, but I'll definitely be back next time I fly into Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love this place as the food is always fresh and well prepared.   The Jasmine ' Rice is a wonderful meal.  I love it with lamb or chicken and my vegetarian friends enjoy it without meat.   Very good juices and nonalcoholic drink selection.  Save room for the wonderful baklava or take some home.   Perhaps there could be more wait staff but everyone is pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"I have been to Alladins many times before and have been very pleased with their fatoosh, grape leaves, hummus and falafel. However I wanted to try something new this time and I went for the Jasmines favorite. It came out and was not even hot at all, and just by looking at it you could see how dried everything was. I was very dissapointed in this and told the waitress, she seemed to have an attitude after this. They brought out the same dish which just seemed to be heated up to steaming hot and still pretty dry. The person I was with also had jasmines favorite with the tuna and their meal was also very dry. I don't understand why they don't use oil or water when they cook these dishes. Its very terrible when served like this and I won't be getting this dish again. I hope the chef will see this and change the way they make these dishes so people don't choke on their food!"}
{"text":"One of the best middle eastern places ever. Pleasant staff and quick service."}
{"text":"Good, affordable, reliable. Big menu with lots of good stuff. Can be kind of busy on the weekends but you rarely have to wait."}
{"text":"Went because of all the great reviews. Not impressed. 5 of us, and nobody was thrilled with their meal. The hummus was very thin. The meat was crazy overcooked. Just a pile of burnt meat and rice. I'd have to consult somebody who actually loves the place to see what to order, but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. Catering is fantastic too - I made a last-minute order of 60 wraps about an hour before I needed them, and Aladdin's was the only place around willing to take the order with such short notice. The food was great, and they gave me a $25 gift certificate too."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  Nice atmosphere. Soups, salads, pitzas, rolled pitas are all excellent.  Cannot go wrong at Aladdin's"}
{"text":"Love Aladdin's. The food is tasty and fresh. The service is fast and friendly. I like how the vegetarian and vegan options are well-marked on the menu (and Gluten-free, but I don't pay attention to that).   The lentil soup is really good, and the vegetarian sample appetizer is a good way to try a few things at once. The baba is pretty delicious, but you can hardly go wrong.   I took some Arab friends here--they approved and even said it compared to what they would eat at home. That's a good sign in my book!  At some point, I need to save room for dessert. The cakes in the display always look amazing, but it's hard to have dessert after enjoying everything else so much."}
{"text":"Large menu, fresh, healthy choices. Great soups and salads. Friendly service. Amazing Desert choices. Hit verbal mint tea ready to pour. Best hummus ever!"}
{"text":"Great fresh not greasy food!  My boy waiter seemed like it was his first time in a restaurant but he must be somebody's nephew. A very enjoyable delicately spiced meal"}
{"text":"Was absolutely disappointed and disgusted with the service and quality of food here. My kids and I could eat more than one bite of food here. Not a fan. And the workers were very quiet and unfriendly, and made us feel very rushed."}
{"text":"Can't even count the number of times I've eaten at this place. Their food is extremely affordable yet healthy and high quality for restaurant standards. I forget the name of this one drink but it was a concoction of celery, carrot juice and a couple of other things - it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Legitimately the worst \"Lebanese\" food I have ever had. If you want to eat somewhere that for some reason has chicken salad instead of fattoush, then go here.   Usually I'm more critical of Middle Eastern restaurants since I am Lebanese, but seriously. This place has no right calling itself a Lebanese restaurant. Their shawarma was terrible and had no garlic, and the only decent samdwich I tried was their chicken curry (and curry isn't even a Lebanese spice).  Their hummus is despicable. It tasted like ground paint. That said, their baba was pleasantly tasty.  I heard their desserts are pretty good, but their food was so terrible I had no desire to eat anything else. I don't know of any good Middle Eastern places near Cleveland, but Aladdin's made me lose hope I would ever find one."}
{"text":"VEGAN REVIEW  This is the second time we've been here, both because the Hippie and I have been hauling ourselves from southcentral Indiana to points east...or on the way home.  We have been very pleased, both times.  The wraps with falafal plus hummus or baba are not quite enough food for a full meal, maybe, if you haven't been sitting in a car all day, but the lentil \"pita pocket\" looked as big as a basketball.   Plus, the menu is all marked vegan/vegetarian.  And the management knows that the condiment you asked about has Worcestershire sauce, and therefore anchovies, in it."}
{"text":"So good today; great place to.rely on in town consistently. Seems they're improving..."}
{"text":"Great place!  The hummos is unique - lighter than average and very yummy. The rice with vermicelli, pine nuts and a hint of cinnamon was great. If you get a salad, definitely go for their house dressing - the mint in it is very subtle and makes for a dressing you won't get anywhere else."}
{"text":"Always my go to chain for gluten - free.   The server could have been better but the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and it is hard to find a place that caters to my tastes and does it well.  This place does it in spades!  My boyfriend eats meat so he can enjoy it as well.  I LOVE the hummus and the Ali Baba Pitza!  We go here for birthdays, New Years, and just because.    I have seen kids here, but there is no kids menu, so be sure your kids will eat anything.    The deserts are killer!"}
{"text":"The food is always good and appropriately priced. I had Jafar's Pizza, which was very tasty.  Make sure to save room for one of their cake slices for dessert!  However, our waitress was pushy and was annoying."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise. We came off the highway to find real food while driving cross country. Absolutely worth it. My Ali Hannah (eggplant) pizza is divine."}
{"text":"I've been a longtime patron of this Aladdin's location, but the service was dismal the last two times I visited (both were around 2:00 PM).  I still like Aladdin's food, but I'll be going to one of the other locations from now on."}
{"text":"Great food at a very decent price range. I tried the mixed platter. Really enjoyed it. I also recommend the light Lebanese beer alamaza. The service was great."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to enjoy a gluten - free delicious meal.  I've found that no matter what location,  the food is delicious and the service is super friendly.  There are plenty of options and we've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Always one of my go-to's! Menu is extensive, delicious, and well priced. Staff is very friendly. You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Aladdins is probably the first thing I think about when I am coming back to Hudson, and I have weird cravings for their falafel only a weekly basis.  Their falafel is easily my favorite anywhere! Also, hummus and hot sauce is incredible, their wraps are delicious, and salads are great.  They also have really good option for people who don't like mediterranean/Lebanese, like the honey mustard chicken wrap, and other salads/sandwiches/wraps.  Prices are so low (shhh...don't tell them I said that....) for the quality and amount of food.  Their deserts are also fabulous. Love love love loveeeeeee"}
{"text":"This review is just for a take out falafel pita. It had such a great flavor between the falafel, tahini sauce and pickled vegetables. I could eat one every day. I was able to use $10 for $5 from yelp and they were real friendly to boot. I had the exact same experience at another store in the Waterworks . All pro and no con so far."}

{"text":"I've lived next to Aladdin's for a couple of years.  I think it is decidedly average.  The restaurant does a lot of things well, and it really is a nice option for affordable Mediterranean food.  Good items on the menu include the various plates, sandwiches, and soups, but after multiple visits, I've settled on the overstuffed salad pockets, with their nice combination of starch and lettuce and nice dressing.  I would recommend staying away from the smoothies and kitschy pitzas.  If you like desserts, Aladdin's has good baklava and offers a large selection of cakes, and you can also grab a bag of pita bread to go that is way better than anything at the grocery store.  I've always had a positive experience except for the one time when the hummus was tooo salty, but despite of (or maybe because of) living next door, I never crave their food and always go for the convenience.  Overall, okay but not great."}
{"text":"Food was great- had the Curry Chicken Rolled Pita and I loved it! Cool atmosphere, good food. I will definitely be making plenty more trips in the future. The only reason it didn't get the full five stars is because I thought the service could be improved upon. But otherwise - I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Large portion sizes, very friendly staff. Variety of meat and vegan options. I had the schwarma sandwich and lentil soup, both pretty good."}
{"text":"Aladdins is the restaurant I choose to frequent with my girl friends when we all get together, like we did this past Tuesday night. Service at the Rockside location is always friendly and efficient. Best of all, I have a ton of gluten free options. I start with the hummus, and I ask for a veggie platter to eat it with since I can't have the pita. Let the sever know which vegetables you prefer. Aladdins hummus is amazing, nice and creamy. Order it with a side of hot sauce for an extra kick. No one does falafel like Aladdins either, so I like to order their falafel appetizer platter with a side of hot sauce to go with their tahini. Big favorites amongst my friends is their Chicken-Len-Chilli with feta (a combination of their soup offerings), the Baba Gannouj appetizer, and the Shish Tawook Rolled. Although we are usually too full, Aladdins does have a large assortment of desserts, including (sometimes) a gluten free option. Drinks include everything from teas to soft drinks and wine. Everything is reasonably priced and the portions are a good size. The menu tells you which options are vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, or has nuts, which I find helpful. This location is great for large groups so if your friends are looking for a new place to try, make sure to bring them to Aladdins on Rockside."}
{"text":"Service is good but food is bad! Heartless cooking. I think they really don't know what is Arabia food! And they should learn how to seasoning the dishes and how to use spices!"}
{"text":"This is considered our fast food restaurant of choice. Excellent healthy food! If we are out and about we stop and get a tabouleh salad and a V-9 or lentil soup. Don't feel sick afterwards like I do when I eat at McDonald's. This is real food and a change from the steak and potato and wing places in Mentor. Service is always great."}
{"text":"Do you call that arabic food? Bad and expensive, and they serve a small amount on every dish. No spices or garlic Added to the shawarma. It's one of the worst places to go for arabic food. 2 stars for being clean"}
{"text":"consistantly good!  you can count on this place! i am thrilled with more veggies in the rolls, good move aladdins!    order hot sauce with EVERYTHING. save room for the chocolate bomb.   if i ever leave ohio, i will surely miss this place."}
{"text":"This is a solid Mediterranean place.  The hummus is excellent, and the bread is fresh.  Both the chicken shawarma and the falafel are good choices.  Everything was well seasoned and flavorful.  The place was easy to find, and I even managed to snag a meter spot right out front.  There is also a parking garage just across the street if you don't find parking on the street.  This is my favorite Mediterranean place so far in Pittsburgh. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Found a Yelp deal that helped me save a bit of money at Aladdin's.  The food here is reliably good and they have locations that are convenient for me.  The hummus, falalfel and chicken shwarma are all winners.  The only real downside is the price.  $7 for a hummus appetizer?  A bit steep..."}
{"text":"We're new to the neighborhood and got takeout and were very impressed. We got a chicken shower a roll that was very tasty and fresh. The hummus was a large order and very good. The \"pitza\" we got was a bit I a stretch, but it was amazing. Pita base, hummus and a delicious combination of ground meat and tomatoes. Te manager Danielle was very sweet and gave us some pastries as we're new to the neighborhood. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"With a wide range of delicious Mediterranean food and warm service, Aladdin's is a nice place for when you realize it's 8PM and you haven't started dinner yet.   Some of my favorite dishes include: Chicken Chilli with Feta, Shish Kabob-Rolled, V-9 soup with Feta and the Hummus. While the dining environment is definitely casual and family friendly, they also have some beers on the menu.  They also have arguably the best cake deserts in town. Or try the Baclava if you want to save on the calories."}
{"text":"I just had this  for the first try tonight. A decent spot. Had the regular salad, Lentil, and a spicy mafra pita and a chicken djon pita as well. It was nothing special, but if you are a calorie watcher, this will do the job. Don't suggest the Spicy Pita, but the chicken was pretty solid. Lentil was good, and it just did the job for me, so as always , 3+ equals a thumbs up in my book."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is honestly one of my favorite restaurants. Even though it is in Crocker Park, it is never so busy that it turns me away. The prices are pretty cheap and the portions are great! I can get an entire meal (appetizer, entree, dessert) for under $20. And it is always delicious! Everything is fresh and the flavors are full. Even my dad who usually hates Mediterranean food, loved the food here! The salad is great, the pita rolls are soooo good, and the dessert, wow. Just love, love, love everything I've ever eaten here."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Lebanese food. Great flavors. Very fresh ingredients. Our server was super friendly and answered our many questions. The strawberry smoothie was so good that my husband got a second one to go."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service.  Take-out can be a bit slow but that is usually because many of the walk-in take-out orders have no idea what is on the menu.  Favorites are Shishtawook with extra pickles and the sauce on the side, a large Tabouli (without the pita), Greek Chicken Salad with grilled moist chicken that is to die for, and the Lentil Soup.    The food is fresh and most of the patrons are repeat customers.  I always take out of town guests here because it is inexpensive and very healthy.  Kids love the Pita Pizzas.  Good selection of beer and wine."}
{"text":"Alladin's is an overall great place to eat and had many options for many types of eaters. That being said we had some issues with service... my friend, a vegetarian, ordered off the vegetarian section and I order a chicken pita.  Since both of our meals were rolled pitas they were packaged the same.  When they were served to us the waitress gave us the wrong ones and my friend ended up biting into chicken. Even though nothing bad came from her biting into chicken except for her being frustrated and disgusted something could've happened.  I was thinking what if she was allergic to something in that wrap and she bit into it and something did happen? Next time I go there I really hope they get a little more organized.  Other than that the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Aladdin's is certainly one of those places that has something for everyone. Vegan folks can find something to eat and so can the picky or new to middle eastern food types.  Falafel is excellent, the hummus is lovely, salads and wraps are both just big enough to share really and check out their desserts. I love their smoothies as well.    The Lakewood location is my favorite because the staff could not be friendlier and they're incredibly helpful when you aren't quite sure what an item is or don't remember what you had but can describe it. They're warm and patient. When you stop in for a meal at the Lakewood Aladdin's it feels like you've stepped into your corner spot and not like a restaurant with multiple locations.  I've called in take out orders and never had a problem.  I believe that they do catering as well, however; I have never used their services."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a great place to get a healthy, easy, and delicious meal. We often get it as takeout on nights when making dinner isn't an option. One of my favorites is the tuna steak rolled. I love it. I also love the baba and hummus for appetizers. You pretty much can't go wrong with Aladdins though. If you are a vegetarian, this place is perfect. There are 29 vegetarian options. Overall, Aladdin's is a great place to grab some healthy food. However, I recommend takeout, as the atmosphere inside is nonexistent."}
{"text":"Always good food. Must have some growing pains after first opening. On top of of sonce my earliest visits.   Falafel is fresh and tasty. Baba is great too. Love Jasmines favorite Chicken Mishwa and the Flavor savor.  Been many times since this location has opened and been to others in the state.   Amazingly consistent now. Great vegetarian options too. I can go total vegetarian and be satisfied."}
{"text":"I am always amazed at how their food is consistently good, fresh and reasonably priced.   The location is gorgeous and the staff is quick and courteous. They have a nice selection of wine and beer if you want a drink with lunch or dinner. Recommend this place to all!"}
{"text":"Mediterranean Lamb plate was totally awesome worth the trip. It is surprisingly hard to find lamb cooked perfectly as this lamb was nicely grilled very moist with fantastic flavor."}
{"text":"Terrific Middle Eastern food!  I am part Syrian, so I asked the host (who happened to also be Syrian) what menu items were specifically Syrian, and he was very kind and helpful in pointing out the particular dishes for me.  I tried Chicken Sambusek, and it was absolutely delicious.  I definitely recommend that one.  I then had one of the Shishtawook rolled pitas, and it was very good.  Great place with delicious food for a very reasonable price! It also had a very nice dining area for the price level.  Pass your regular chain restaurants and get great food here for even less money."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a decent Mediterranean restaurant.Has a more Greek touch than Arabic.Prices are reasonable and food is always fresh. Pastries / cheesecakes are a little pricey."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here. I have eaten at Aladdins in Akron, Columbus, and Cincinnati and they're very good. However the location in Independence has a juicer that is unbelievably loud. It's like eating in a construction zone next to the jack hammer. Absolutely horrible. Bring earplugs or eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is good, however at this location I have never had good service. The hostess (Layla) at the front is rude and entitled. Once seated, your wait for everything is way too long, even if you are the only person in the restaurant. Retrain or re staff because the food is too good for such horrible service."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Had loebee and Diwali for appetizers. Amazing.  The pitza was delicious. If you like middle eastern Food this place is a must go to."}
{"text":"The food here is great!  Everything is very fresh and well made!  The only time there is a problem is when they are busy.  I'm not sure the wait staff is trained to handle a big rush, they seem to get flustered easily.  On busy nights I find it best to simply order my food to go otherwise you end up waiting 45 minutes for a dish that takes under 10 minutes to prepare."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. The food is amazing, and the service is great.   Two pieces of criticism. One, a lunch menu is needed. It is very pricey to eat there for lunch. Two, if you don't have a lunch menu, then do not give smaller portions during lunch. Ordered the Jasmine rice both times for myself. The dinner portion was huge, but the lunch portion was small. Same price though. That alone would make me not patron a restaurant again, but your food is very good."}
{"text":"Always fresh and always delicious.  The hummus with hot sauce is amazing!! The Fatoush salad is one of my favorite dishes as well as most of the shwarma pita sandwiches.  Great place for kids because they have smoothies of all kinds and great desserts.  It's a bonus if you can sit on the patio. I can't recommend it more when you're looking for something a bit different."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean meal my mouth has ever met.   The garlic sauce was tasty... the wrap was giant and very reasonably priced for the portion given.  The amount of tastes available is very vast as well."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for a business meeting through the online system which was a mistake from the start. Once I arrived to pick it up, they claimed that the online order was not scheduled for hours (which did not agree with the confirmation email I got). Then they had to make the whole order, causing me to wait an extra 45 minutes without even offering an apology or a glass of water. When it was ready, I saw the hostess checking the bag so i assumed that I would not have to check, wrong! Once I drove back, half of the order was missing then the hostess tried telling me it was my fault over the phone. Terrible experience and hosting. Will not be returning to this location because of this."}
{"text":"For quick food you can't beat it.  Try the Baba Gannouj instead of the Hummus.  If your not sure what to get, try the Aladdin's Favorite Combo which gives you Beef Kafta, Shish Kabob, and Shish Tawook on a bed of seasoned brown rice and a small salad, sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, and choice of dressing.  Ask for both the cucumber and garlic sauces on the side for your meat."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?! The TWO employees behind the counter couldn't be bothered to seat or acknowledge our party, one was on the phone, the other texting on a personal phone. The Mediterranean eatery down the street served us well.  I will try Aladdin's again because the food is good but they need to shape up with the service."}
{"text":"Went today with some girlfriends as an monthly luncheon. The food is amazing. We had a pretty awful server that forgot a number of items and was never apologetic. She had another employee bring over everything she kept forgetting. Evan was very hospitable and helpful. I'm not sure if he was a waiter or a busser but he got our tip since he was much better and obviously enjoyed his job much more than our waitress."}
{"text":"Just excellent  We went in for lunch today. It was during lunch hour so the place was packed. We had to wait a few min for the table but once we were seated, things were smooth. Although, it was a busy lunch time, our server was nice, prompt and attentive.   We ordered hummus, tabouli, and Aladdin's favorite combo. The hummus was one of the best ive had like anywhere! It was silky smooth with good flavor. The tabouli was nice and fresh, it had a tad bit too much olive oil. The Aladdin's favorite combo was also really good. The rice was done just right, and both beef kafta and shish kabob were great.   All in all, it really was an amazing meal."}
{"text":"I was originally drawn in by check-in offer, but it''s available only on dine-in orders over $25. I got carry out around 5 pm on a weekday. My order was ready in about ten minutes, and the staff were polite. I got the Chicken Sambusek plate, which has chicken, onions, herbs, and spices folded in a pita pie with a salad.   The filling was delicious--the chicken tender, slightly charred, and seasoned well. The small amount of vegetables broke up the meatiness. However, the texture of the pita ranged from crunchy to soft to tough and chewy. I wasn't a fan of the tough, chewy parts, and a lot of the pita had that texture. I ate the food soon after I got it, while it was still warm, so I don't think time was the issue. In addition, the accompanying salad was a little lackluster. While the vegetables were fresh, they didn't seem to form anything cohesive. The dressing didn't help much; it contributed more of an oily mouth feel than flavor.  Although I won't be seeking out opportunities to return, I wouldn't mind trying some other menu items, especially the meats."}
{"text":"I really don't like Alladins! I have been there so many hoping to change my mind, but the food there is very commercial, and not authentic middle-eastern at all. Everything taste so different from the hummus to the kebbe, and the bread is not fresh!"}
{"text":"Am I the only one who thinks this franchise is overrated? It is ok (like mcdonalds) you know what you are going to get when you get there, btw i like a few things..the soups, fatoush salad, etc. It has a certain responsibility to the public to be a certain way and it is. I have not had anything \"bad\" it has always been good but chain like. Which is what it is...a chain."}
{"text":"This place rocks the Middle Eastern. It's casual, but what they do they do well.  I don't know about the smoothie debate but two things you must have:  - Chicken Len-Chili:  Grilled chicken on top of a bowl filled with half spicy chili and half lentil soup.  Awesome.  Try it with cheddar on top.  Other cheeses were offered, too, and they'd probably be great as well.  - Chicken Sambusek Plate: Spicy curried chicken with fresh peas, onions, and other veggies, wrapped up into a neat triangle with pita bread and served crisped and toasty.  Comes with salad; the tahini dressing I got was also great.  So, maybe it does depend on what you order, but the stuff I ate was great and very reasonable.  I'll definitely be back, and we'll see if I have a different experience.  For now, I  *heart* Aladdin."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is a real gem in the Waterworks shopping mall.  The food is not only delicious but fresh, healthy, and vegetarian friendly.  The hummus is excellent, as is the lentil soup and FRESH stuffed grape leaves (most restaurants serve them from a can, but Aladdin's makes them fresh).  The service was great, the decor was really nice and cosy.  And don't miss the desserts - we had a carrot cake cheesecake that was to die for.  They also have outdoor seating, which is so hard to find!  This is one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience here, i just ate here yesterday, the service is 100% better than the aladdins in independence. our waitress was friendly, prompt,  and professional. They even had music in the backround at this one.  The food of course was good as usual. But i go more for the atmosphere. After eating at this one, i will never go back to the one in Independence.  oh and i definately recommend the Truffle Ball"}
{"text":"Very delicious flavor! Dawali plate, Lebanese salata and the rice burst with so much awesome combination of spices. Hot sauce is delicious. The lemoncello cake is your destiny. Mint tea and lamb will take a few minutes because it is made to order. yum! Yum! Yum!"}
{"text":"So so so so good. In my opinion you can't go wrong with what you order here. Last night I got a tropical smoothie and the hummus shawarma plate.  However they cook that and whatever spice is used is so delicious. And when you walk in, you'll see a display of cakes that just look sinly. I don't think 'sinly' is a word but it is now. Service is awesome too, our waiter was super nice."}
{"text":"A great place to get fresh food for same price as the lesser quality \"fast casual\" chains. I think it's best suited for lunch, but I've had good dinners here too. I like the salads best, but the wraps and pita pizzas are great. The smoothies are awesome as well. They also have entrees, but if I want an entree I go to their sister eatery, Taza. The best thing about Aladdin's is you leave feeling like you had a good meal, but you don't hate yourself (and you wallet doesn't hate you)."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is like a Middle Eastern version of Olive Garden. The ambiance and service are decent. The menu is a suspiciously long plastic-coated multipage affair. The food is utterly mediocre at best. Everything tastes like it came out of a package/can/freezer/microwave and unfortunately mine wasn't zapped enough so it was only lukewarm. -sigh- There are many better restaurants within a few blocks of Aladdin's in Squirrel Hill and there are many better Middle Eastern restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Wow.  The food and the service was impeccable.  Love the chicken schwarma to die for."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and fresh. I love going and just ordering the vegetarian appetizer sampler so I get a taste of it all. The meats are also delicious; the lamb almost tastes like a fine steak! They cook it all very well.  It is a small restaurant, so a little packed, but it has a nice charm to it. The staff has always been very friendly and helpful here and they come by very often (I guess since it is such a small place!) and check on you.  While most of the food is delicious and spiced just right, for some reason their hummus is a little bland. You can fix this easily though by asking for the hot sauce, and mixing some of it with the hummus. But I like things a bit spicy sometimes. Other than that, the rest is all great.  I recommend it to everyone. If you are new, I would suggest tying the appetizer sampler and trying it all, and also order one of the pita pizzas (falafel pizza is one of my favorites). You will be a fan in no time!"}
{"text":"I have eaten in the Squirrel Hill Aladdin's many times but have been visiting the North Hills location more frequently in the recent year. I happened to be in Squirrel Hill last Saturday and decided to have lunch at Aladdin's. The woman who greeted me was rude and nasty and made a big fuss when I asked for a table away from the door. The restaurant was empty, and she muttered something about getting very busy. I ordered the chicken salad, which I have had many times before. The menu clearly states that it comes with feta or cheddar. The salad was brought to me without any cheese and, when I asked for feta, I was told there would be an up charge for cheese. I commented that I had ordered that salad many times and never charged extra for the cheese. The waitresses comment was, \"Sorry, there's a up charge.\" It seemed to be ridiculous to make a fuss about an small up charge, but I took a to go menu with me and checked the salad. Sure enough, the cheese is included in the chicken salad....no up charge. I will avoid the Squirrel Hill location in the future. The staff in the North Hills location is very friendly, attentive and well trained. The atmosphere really can make or break a dining experience."}
{"text":"I liked that they offer a variety of vegetarian meals , their food was fresh , i usually like the falafel to come as a small round pieces instead of a big one, other than that i think this place is a good choice to get middle eastern food in oakland !"}
{"text":"Every few weeks, I pop into Aladdin's to grab some hummus, lentil soup, and their super tasty chicken chili. One of the many reasons to love Aladdin's is the low guilt factor. They seem to use great ingredients and The nutritional information always looks positive. There's rarely room for dessert, but they have incredible looking treats on display."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed Aladdin's in Cleveland Heights with my wife and we both really liked it and will be back soon to try something else on their extensive menu. My Falaffel Pitza was very good, if anything I maybe would have preferred a whole wheat pita, but didn't even think to ask. My wife loved her carrot smoothie. Very good prices, our server was knowledgeable, polite, attentive. The decor is nice, bathrooms were very clean, overall a very good experience!"}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food at a great price.  Everything was consistently good, and even the kids meal stuck to a Mediterranean angle, but the kiddos love it. We've had a long day on the road and plenty of fast food and this was a great place to end the day! Don't let the \"strip mall\" scare you away.  Go for it."}
{"text":"I work in the same plaza as this aladdins location and eat here once a week. I can honestly say I've never had a bad experience here. The employees are always helpful. The food is always good. Some of my favorites are the flavor savor special, tons of food and great value. All the rolleds are awesome. I never thought I'd enjoy vegetarian meals in my life but I now eat the v9 soup, falafel rolleds, and all their salads. If your looking for a quick snack grab a smoothie, always hits the spot. Make sure you leave room for dessert, their case is always full of wonderful options."}
{"text":"Aladdin's Eatery serves amazing food that easily rivals any other Middle Eastern restaurant. That being said, I would prefer slightly larger portions. Also, their desser menu is great as are their assortment of drinks. Their juices are fresh-squeezed. I tried the apple juice and it was very very good. The waiters and waitresses are very nice as well.  A good restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the few places in the Cleveland area where you can order fresh vegetable juice. They offer a combo of carrot, celery, and spinach but it's mostly carrot."}
{"text":"We stop whenever we are in the area, they never disappoint, the food no matter what we order always is as good as we remember it, and the service is helpful and quick."}
{"text":"We were surprised at the good variety of options here, both meaty and vegetarian, healthy and less-so.  I had the len-chili soup, it was delicious with the feta sprinkled on top.  Their side salad was good too.  Most portions were quite generous - definitely enough to share.  The hummus was good, although a bit heavy on the tahini for my taste.  The fancy cakes in the case seemed a bit odd given the middle eastern theme of the food, but they looked lovely - I'll have to try them another time.  Best of all, the prices were pretty reasonable.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  I have never had a bad meal.  Affordable, fresh tasty food.  Good service and always great.  Hummus is a must, don't forget the hot sauce.  It's worth extra $.50.  The chicken curry rolled is my fav.  I get it every time and make my wife get something else to try. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Since we have moved away from Ohio, I still dream about Aladdin's!  This restaurant has delicious, incredibly fresh food.  The quality of food for the price is notable."}
{"text":"We went for the first time after it was recommended by some friends. When we arrived I was super hangry and overall in a pretty bad mood but by the time we left I was full, happy and very impressed by the place. Our waiter was great and came by frequently but not too much. He also did a great job recommending food. I had the lamb pita and my husband had the shawarma plater. Our food took a little long, but we didn't really notice until the server apologized for the long wait. Not only that, but the manager then came over and offered us free dessert. We accepted, but insisted that we didn't even notice the food was delayed. Then, at the end he told us that he was comping out whole meal too. It was overly generous and much appreciated. The food was outstanding and alone good enough to have a return, but the service and management was some of the best we ever received and guaranteed that we will return soon."}
{"text":"One of the better 'food' places in Pittsburgh! Hands down. The place is simple and unpretentious but the food is amazing! I am a small portion eater and I had a whole big beef shawarma (griled beef with whole bunch of sauces and veggies rolled in pita) all by myself! I didn't even offer my friend any. Well he devoured his chicken salad, which sounds 'nothing much' but it is in every shape and form.  The DESSERT is pretty darn good. They give you a dessert tour. Lots of chocolatey options.  Overall it was one of the best $12 I have ever spent for dinner and dessert!"}
{"text":"Best. Baba. In. Cleveland.  Hands-down. Delish. I'm there at least once a week getting takeout."}
{"text":"Laid back location with lots of seating and friendly attentive staff.  As always with Aladdins locations, the food was pretty good, but not the exceptional fare you'll get at a good one-off location in a bigger city."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a staple in my diet.  Great, fresh food, good prices and fast."}
{"text":"Never disappointed at this Aladdins. Food is always good, friendly service. We always try something new when we go and we are never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Great service! Vai was our waitress, she was very friendly with a great attitude and great customer service!! Food was awesome i had the jasmine rice with beef. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new, we stopped in to see what the menu was like. Our waiter -jackson- gave us great suggestions! Food was spectacular and service was great!! Highly recommend!!! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place serves consistently good Americanized Middle Eastern food. I've had  tuna and lamb plates here, and they've been good. The flavors won't blow you away but just about everything on the menu is tasty and well prepared. Wait staff has been knowledgeable about the food each time I've been there.  Waterworks location doesn't have a liquor license but there's a state wine store nearby and you can bring a bottle into the restaurant."}
{"text":"I really, really like this place.  The food is fresh and consistently good.  Especially for such a reasonably priced, casual place, the service is exceptionally good.  They are always extremely friendly and accommodating.  I feel happy as soon as I walk in their door!  A standby."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food with a bakery and fresh fruit smoothies.  The price won't break the piggy bank either."}
{"text":"I definitely do not come here for the attention from the hostess (nonexistent) service (where is our waiter?) or ambiance (5 out of 10 for cleanliness).  But the vegetarian platter and tabbouleh are super!  I crave the tabbouleh and babaganoush (nice and smokey)!  Hit or miss on the baklava."}
{"text":"I have dined here more than 20 times now. Hands down: Excellent flavorful food, fresh ingredients, good service, always consistent. Aladdin never disappoints you."}
{"text":"I love this place.  If you're vegetarian or not, the selection is fresh, flavorful and healthy.  Try the Dawali, but the hummus is the best in NE Ohio."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and probably never would have found this place if it wasn't right across the street from the Hilton but I'm glad that I did.  It really is a gem.  this place is an awesome, mix of market and take-out with tons of classic Mediterranean dishes- hummus, pita, falafel etc.  I got namoura, baklava, hummus and z'atar all of which was awesome!  Whether you're staying across the street or across town this place is a must."}
{"text":"Had lunch to meet up with some long lost cousins and ordered Alladin's combo special.  The good: service  The bad: everything else  Over priced? Check.  Small portions? Check.   Overcooked and dried out chicken? Check.  Overcooked and dried out lamb? Check.  Overcooked and dried out beef? Check.  Chicken breasts and not thighs? Check.   No thanks.   Decent Mediterranean food is still unfortunately so lacking in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Meh, OK. I ordered the kebab pita wrap. The beef was a bit dry and tough. I also got the baba gannoush -- it was yummy. The fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice really hit the spot.. But I stopped mid bite, sitting at a back table that looked into the kitchen, when I saw a server open a cooler with peeled carrots and veggies, knock a carrot to the floor, and then nonchalantly putting it right back into bin of fresh carrots without rinsing or anything. Really? It made my stomach turn."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, both times in the dinner hour. The first time was with friends.  My meal was bland - very little flavor. And both the meat and the bread were overly dry. Next time I went with my family because they wanted to try Aladdin's.  I thought I'd give it another go; one bad meal does not make a bad restaurant.  Well this was just as bad.  None of us enjoyed our food.  The wait staff was fine, but we waited what seemed like a long time for relatively simple food. I won't be going back to this or any Aladdin's.  There are far better restaurants even in 15238 area."}
{"text":"Food is eatable at most. Does not taste bad, not really that great either. I just have one suggestion for the staff: if you are not sure if someone need plastic fork/spoon for their take out, ask!! Don't just give people food without any tool to eat."}
{"text":"Just ok, the food was good just not what I expected. Nothing bad to report, nothing exciting to write about. Hummus was good with the house made hot sauce."}
{"text":"One of many similar Aladdin's restaurants in the Cleveland area.  This well known regional chain offers consistent good service and high quality food. While my middle eastern friends do not find it authentic, I am not as good a judge of this. They appeal to a more standard American palate by offering middle eastern style pizzas that are a local favorite.  Good option for informal gathering of friends or family."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Fresh and flavorful!  Love the V9 with chicken soup, humus, tawook rolled and alladins salad.  The house dressing is an herb-filled vinegrette.  They have a great selection of vegan and gluten free options.  The only reason I give them 4 stars is because of inconsistent service."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and the food has always been amazing. I recommend the babaganoush, vegetarian sampler, kibble, and anything you can get their hot sauce for. The cakes are amazing. I can't say enough how good the cakes are. Service is also descent. Only once has the waiter been overly eager but he was young and seemed new."}
{"text":"Excellent place to dine and relax. Food was wonderful, service too.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was craving a falafel today and so turned to Yelp to guide me.  I live near this Aladdin in Lakewood and am new to the area, so gave it a shot.  I'm a bit miffed, however.  I have no objections to the food I was served, it was OK.  I've had better.  But right there very boldy on the menu it said Enjoy a POT of tea.  That sounded really nice, a whole POT of tea.   So I ordered my falafel wrap and a POT of tea.  I  was brought a CUP of tea.  For the same price as the pot of tea that I desired and know I clearly ordered. It was good tea, but why no pot of tea?   I also asked for some hot sauce to spice it up a bit and noticed that they had to bring it to me in a plastic lidded container.  Seriously, no table hot sauce?  Then to top it off they charged me .60 for the small amount of hot sauce I did use.  Little things like this really make a difference. And they also really bug me.    LIke I said I liked the food,  but next time it is call ahead for Takeout.  I have my own hot sauce and will make my own pot of tea.  The hummus is super creamy."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh.  I don't think I've ever gotten something that I didn't like.  The biggest drawback when going to Aladdin's is the menu choices!  The servers are very friendly and helpful.  There is a very large parking lot (with meters) just around the corner.  Outdoor seating (weather permitting) makes for great people watching."}
{"text":"Attention everyone: The falafel fucking rules. Do yourself a service and purchase that fine appetizer. Aladdins recently offered a pitza special of which had chicken, banana pepper, caramelized onion, and the honey dijon. Was never a personal fan of such honey dijon types, but it really went well with everything else. Had my lady friend not yelled at me I would have eaten all of it off her own plate. Aladdins rules."}
{"text":"Not because it's amazing, although it's great. But because I've eaten at most of the Alladin's, often, for about 8 years and never had a bad experience. very consistent. can't go wrong."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a value dining option in the Heights, Aladdin's is the place. Food is very fresh, service is prompt, and not overpriced. I enjoy having vegetarian options and Aladdin's several tasty non-meat dishes. I particularly like their lentil soup and vegetarian chili. Great Mediterranean food in Cleveland Heights."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a Cleveland landmark. Whenever I'm back in town, it's on the list of places to hit. The hot sauce is absolutely delicious, and should be applied to everything from falafel to shwarma. The Westlake location sells beer and wine.   The most amazing thing is how long this place has been around. I can't imagine how difficult it must have been to get Cleveland on the vegetarian Lebanese food kick back in the day!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites!   I haven't had anything I don't like.  Their hummus is my favorite but everything else is good too, love the smoothies!"}
{"text":"Yum, falafel! Yum, hummus! Yum, so many vegetarian options! Always a good go - to for delicious middle eastern foods."}
{"text":"We ordered take out for seven people and they had it ready in 25 minutes. Order was correct and on time. Highly recommend and very delicious."}
{"text":"The cooks at this location need to be refreshed on how to make their dishes. The dishes are much lower in quality, cleanliness, and flavor compared to the Cranberry and Squirrel Hill locations. My partner and I have visited and had take out from this location many times and have been consistently disappointed. Disappointments include, burned greasy bits stuck to the bottom of out peta roles, waiters forgetting to get us pitas on more than two occasions, missing ingredients in dishes, and complete lack of flavor. I think the biggest disappointment is that we know how good it can be and get our hopes up each time. \"Maybe this time it won't be half bad\" We have yet to be impressed or even satisfied. Quotes from my partner about this location: \"Smells better than it tastes\" \"It's better than not eating anything, but not by much\""}
{"text":"One of the best places that I found in Pittsburgh ! The food is awesome , the decor is great and the device is amazing !!! Big fan of this place . Their Jasmine specials are really good !!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. Service is exceptional. Food is fantastic, and very reasonable! You absolutely must have the Baba Ganoush. (Huge portion, perfect for sharing). I have also tried the spicy Mediterranean chili (last fall), which was warm, filling and smokey delish. The house salad dressing is perfect (not too heavy), definitely try it if you go the salad route. Also, they have awesome fresh fruit and veggie smoothies, or homemade cookies and brownies!"}
{"text":"All the staples are excellent here (baba, hummus, tabouli, grape leaves (hot or cold!), etc.). The V9 soup is a perfect light lunch. Their freshly made hot sauce is the best - you have to ask for it, and it pairs perfectly with everything on the menu (mix it into hummus - yum)."}
{"text":"I generally like Aladdin's, but this particular location is by far the worst. The last two times I ate there, the service was unbelievably slow. The ironic thing is there are always a bunch of servers on staff with very few customers. Specifically, this last time, my friend and I were the only two people in the restaurant. We ordered rolled pitas. I saw one takeout order come in. From anywhere in the dining room, you can see the servers standing in the kitchen talking and not paying attention to the customers or to the food coming up. I had to go get my water myself. My cake tasted as if it had been in the dessert case for about a week. I will not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"First time visitor to an Aladdin's and it is now a must to re-visit. Many items to choose from and they are marked if they are vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, and /or contains nuts. We were sat quickly and our server Cara was quick to attend to us. She was most gracious as she explained our questions on the menu and recommendations for us to try. We went with the Vegetarian Combo, good for two, which included Hummus(smooth and flavorful), Tabouli(seasoned perfectly), Baba(great eggplant flavor), Falafel(what a combo with the Tahini Yogurt sauce!), and Dawali(another winner with these grape leaves). It was served with their pitas and the recommended Aladdin's hot sauce. Excellent throughout!! We then split the 4-cut Ali Baba Pitza which was pureed eggplant, tomatoes, feta cheese,  eggplant, and calamata olives. I saved some hot sauce for this crunchy pizza. Cara went the extra step, she was already 5 star before that with her attentiveness and pleasant attitude, and brought us each a piece of baklava for us to take home for our anniversary. They didn't last the return trip home.... Lastly, we ended up buying a couple packages of their pitas and a container of their hot sauce."}
{"text":"The grape leaves and chicken chili are delicious! Their hot sauce with the hummus and pita is also amazing. They have delicious desserts and great portions! The prices are also very reasonable and the staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"I love the food here and the great service. Have visited many branches and gotten great service. Food is always good. Pita bread is awesome, I always buy more!"}
{"text":"Wish they'd open a location in Oregon!  I was recently visiting family in Pittsburgh & came here for a meal.  YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!  I had some lamb that was AMAZING!  I don't eat gluten or dairy & am picky about virtually everything I eat so finding a restaurant like this is GOLDEN!  Food is obtained & prepared with integrity and tastes DEE-LISH-US!  This is a definite stop when I'm in Pittsburgh again!  If you're hungry, EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Every time I go here, the place is clean, the service is prompt, and the food is excellent. Even though I have a limited diet due to health concerns, there are lots of options for healthy and tasty here food for me. I can't recommend this place highly enough. Thanks to everyone there!"}
{"text":"Did not like the rice it was cold and microwaved. They do not have basmati rice. Expensive food and the quality is below average except desserts."}
{"text":"Very flavorful entrees and the baba is unbelievable.   I've sent many people here and never heard of anyone having a bad experience."}
{"text":"Always great for consistent Mediterranean fare with a vegetarian-friendly menu. This is a chain, but a great one. My very picky Tweens love it, so that is a plus the one in Mt Leb has great service and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Great place! priced pretty well, food was authentic and delicious. Had the Sfiha plate which was a seasoned ground beef and tomatoes wrapped in pita bread over a mediterranean salad. That was delicious, just wish there was a little more but left full none the less. My guest had one of the pitza (pita+pizza?) dishes and it looked /tasted phenomenal! Was chicken, peppers, hummus, and scallions, highly recommended! Definitely a \"Go-To\""}
{"text":"The food here is fabulous!!  Very tasty and filling. Came here for lunch, it wasn't crowded, server was nice, hostess was nice"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant!!! My family loves the food!  The restaurant staff were incredibly very friendly and very helpful such as Alexandria!  I recently ordered Party Trays and she was very helpful with what options to choose.....thank you!!!  Keep up the great work! This is definitely one of our \"Keeper\" restaurants and will be ordering here often."}
{"text":"We moved from Cleveland to Seattle nine years ago and come back to visit every year or so. Each trip is not complete without a visit to, or takeout from, Aladdin's. Tonight we had a takeout feast of lentil soup, falafel salad, chicken shawrma, and dolmas rolled pita. The food is fresh and way yummy, a perfect spot for lunch or an affordable dinner."}
{"text":"Favorite place, all locations are on point. Food is always perfect, staff is always wonderful. There's not much in boring, sleepy Mentor that isn't a deep fried franchise so I'm glad that if I hafta be in this city, at least there's one really good restaurant that is veg/vegan friendly. The smoothies are so refreshing too :) thank you :) :) !"}
{"text":"You seriously can't go wrong here! The service is great. The location is even better and the food is the best! Everyone who works there is helpful and willing to answer any questions. I have never had a bad experience while being served. I love the decor and and the parking lot is an added bonus. I've never had to wait for a table here either. The food is great too. Highly recommended any one of their pita pizzas. Also, they have a great kids menu for the little ones. Overall, I love Aladdin's and can't picture myself getting my middle eastern food anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Very healthy, delicious food!  I always feel like I've made a smart choice when we come here.  I love the hummus appetizer with hot sauce on the side.  My kids love it too (minus the hot sauce).  I also get the hummus tabouli rolled, amongst other yummy items.     The hostesses are always very friendly, and one of the previous hostesses would greet me by name.  ( I used to go at least once a week during my last pregnancy - LOL.)  The only thing that prevents me from rating this place a 5 is the cost.  The green bean dish is ridiculously overpriced at almost $10 a serving (really?  for just vegetables?).  As frequently as I go, I wish that they had some sort of frequent customer card, like some places do."}
{"text":"Dinner at Aladdin's Eatery tonight on a quick trip to Mt. Lebanon. Great food and service - shout out to our waiter Matt in his Crocs!"}
{"text":"Counter service is slow.  7 people working behind it but no one looks over to take your order. Had to track down dressing and check too.  Not the best choice for a quick lunch. Food is not an issue however."}
{"text":"Delicious grape leaves, hummus, tabouli! Now, the beef kafta deserves its own praise. So friggen good. I tried some of my friends and immediately regreted the wrap I ordered. The flavor was a homerun out of this world to friggen pluto. I honestly can't put into words how I really felt, but you get the idea I was pleased with it. Don't get me wrong though, my hummus and tabouli wrap was superb! For the price you get a good portion and I was able to take half of my wrap home for a walk down flavor town a second time!  Service was speedy and pleasant and I enjoyed my entire experience! I honestly can't believe I haven't eaten here sooner. I love it!"}
{"text":"Everyone has \"that restaurant\" where you feel at home, don't read the menu, and know more about the joint than the server... This is my restaurant.   It's incredible. You have the get past being intimidated by the menu and then you'll be in heaven!   My personal favorites are the Dawali appetizer and chicken Schwarma pitas. The hummus, tahini, and hot sauce are a must!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. No other words to describe it. Was my first time there tonight, and it was so good that I felt the need to get this app and review the place. Through in and through out, it exceeded my expectations. From the food, to the service, to the cleanliness. Highly recommend getting the lamb plate with some hummus and vegetables. Our waiter couldn't have been better. He was very attentive despite how busy it got and was quite personable. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy.  Every dish I've ordered has been wonderful and one can order wine, beer or healthy juices, and the mint tea is perfect to enjoy with one of the desserts.  Alexandria is my favorite server."}
{"text":"This place has really solid food, I would recommend it for anyone.  Even the kiddos were happy with their food.  The savor flavor is a great combo plate.Save room for dessert, you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and it's always good!  I've had the pitzas and the rolled pitzas and the pita pockets!"}
{"text":"Besides losing my credit card several years ago...we continually return here for the kids specials and my favorite dish flavor savor. Both their lentil soup and fresh fruit smoothie are favorites of mine."}
{"text":"Great food, with an extensive menu. Gotta have hot sauce in the hummus. Yummy in the tummy."}
{"text":"My kind of food, and usually my kind of service. I love the kibbie balls, The hummus and the tabouli. I think these three things are absolute staples. I am disappointed that they can't serve the kibbie the way I like - uncooked!!!  And I can't say enough about their desserts, talk about yummy! Yeah I have to say this is definitely one of my favorite food spots!!"}
{"text":"Their falafel, greek pita pitza, baklava & smoothies are all amazing. Great drink options too. Perfect for casual lunch or a date. I love the variety & options for vegetarians. Everyone I take here is always happy!"}
{"text":"Yes oh yes. My favorite place to eat in all of Ohio. All the Aladdin eateries are fantastic. Gorgeous wait staff and healthy food along with fantastic mango smoothies and babaganoush, chicken wraps, pizzas, there is nothing better to do so go go go. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Pretty good service everytime and I've never had a problem with my meal. They have good fresh pressed juices as well and the deserts are awesome!"}
{"text":"We love Aladdins food, but after our second bad experience with dessert I unfortunately have to rate it 3 stars. The hummus falafel rolled and spicy kafta rolled are delicious as well as the chicken len-chili. This is a great place to get takeout, but don't order a slice of cake. It looks appealing until you bite into a dry, expensive slice of disappointment. I would expect their 'signature' cake to be fresh and moist."}
{"text":"4 Stars means, \"Yay!  I'm a Fan.\"  Truthfully I feel bad for not doing 5 stars, because the food and service were very good, the place was squeaky clean, the food was healthy, and the menu was really informative and well-designed.  Really my only complaint was that I was chilly, but as a Woman of a Certain Age, my personal thermostat is a little touchy.    The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the restaurant isn't really my groove.  The tart flavor of my chicken schwarma was exactly what I wanted that day, after all the sweetness of the holidays, but probably won't go back for another six months or so, because I'm drawn toward more traditional American fare (I know; I'm so pedestrian).    But if you're even one millimeter more worldly than I am, you are absolutely going to love this place.  And if you're not, you definitely should try it at least once."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Ignored by two waitresses so I got up and left. Will never go back."}
{"text":"When I do not want to cook at home and I feel like to dine out pretty \"Healthy\" i always pick this place. I enjoy their Lebanese wrap and salad. Warp inside radish pickles are delicious. Love their dressing choices too. My favorite dressing is honey Dejion dressing. Their lamb is good very tender... Also, I ordered ground beef balls( can't recalled the name of it.) very good.   I usually do not like franchise restaurant. But, Aladdin's Eatery is exceptional!"}
{"text":"I dont care what anyone says, this is by far the best Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food ever. I have not been able to find anything to compare. I wish I still lived in Pgh!"}
{"text":"I've been to Aladdin's a million and one times, and this place has always been top notch. Not only is the atmosphere cozy and inviting with Arabic music playing in the background, but the service bends over backwards to meet the patrons' needs.  And, most importantly, the food is out of this world.   True, the menu can be a bit overwhelming - especially to those who aren't familiar with Middle Eastern cuisine.  However, I'd recommend the Flavor Savor Special. It's a little bit of everything. Trust me when I say your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!! I'm just trying this place for the first time today.  The customer service here is amazing.  The food is fresh, well seasoned, and delicious. Very impressed with this place and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Food was and always is great. This is a chain so all I can say is that the food lived up toy expectations for Aladdin's. The service was abysmal. Appetizer came out w main meal, which all took way too long so we all got full on pita  and absolutely no attention to our table. Other tables around us got service so trying not to take it personal. Won't be at this location again however."}
{"text":"Great place for Mediterranean style fare. Sure it's not four star dinning, but it excellent for the price, and quick if you're fairly short on time.   The hummus is a great starter, and there is plenty of it for several people to share. I usually get the chicken schwarma rolled, and it is always good. It is hard to go wrong, however, as most of the rolled pitas are very good as well. They have a good selection of cheesecakes as well. Cheesecakes are hit or miss, however, depending on how fresh they are."}
{"text":"At one time in my life I ate from Aladdin's fairly regularly.  I happened to be working in the Squirrel Hill area, and would order, or dine-in at least twice a week, if not more.  That was approximately five, or so, years ago. Tonight, I found myself in Mt. Lebo.  I had to pick up a bridesmaid dress, and had not yet eaten.  After leaving the dress shop and yelping nearby vegetarian options, I came across an Aladdin's location less than a half of a mile away from me. I drove straight there hoping that Aladdin's was still everything I remembered. I was greeted by smiling faces, which is always cool. The smiling faces continued when I was greeted by my server, Haley. She was wonderful. I am a terrible decision maker, and was dining solo, so she helped me tremendously.  And by tremendously, I mean she made my decisions for me. If she hated me as a result, she hid it very well. She brought me either the natural energy, or the honeymooner juice. It was awesome, and has me wanting to go back to try others. I told her that there was a chance she was going to hate me, and asked that she bring me a vegan option, otherwise, I would have stared at that menu for another hour at least. She returned, not long after, with the hummus falafel rolled.  I'm considering driving back as I type this to eat it again. It was fabulous. A great balance, not overstuffed, so I didn't feel like a slob while eating it and facing the passersby. The pickles rolled in added the perfect crunch. I took two desserts home with me. Yes..two. I've tried some of both with my coffee this morning. Excellent choice. Blueberry bar and a peanut butter and jelly cookie. Their dessert case looks amazing, but I stuck with the vegan options. Unfortunately, I live about an hour from any Aladdin's, but hopefully I will be returning to this location soon, and hopefully Haley will be working again. Fabulous food and service made for a great solo dining experience."}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's! I enjoy finding food that I can eat here (I'm a vegetarian) and best of all, it's not too expensive.   I've never met a dish that I don't like. I love their pita pizzas, hummus, and baba. In the summer, their salads are always nice and refreshing. Portions are HUGE though, and I usually can't finish them. They have a great selection of desserts as well, although my husband and I almost always split a piece of cake.  One of my favorite cheap eats in Cleveland Heights."}
{"text":"I do not understand the other reviews.  We got excited because we heard this place had the same owner as a delicious upscale Lebanese place in Cleveland that we love with fresh, puffy pitas, fluffy rice and lovely smokey baba ganoush.  This is some of the worst middle eastern food that I have ever had. What wasn't critically overcooked was over-vinagered and over-lemoned. The baba ganoush tasted like it came from a can, the pitas are pre-packaged (like everywhere in Squirrel Hill). The server, while very nice, did not know a thing about middle eastern food and couldn't answer any of our questions about the menu. Frankly, I can't explain why I even gave it a second star, except that I'm feeling generous.  It is also not a nice place to sit, unless you enjoy the feeling of dining inside a convenience store."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! In fact I think every time I've come home to visit my parents in the last several years, we have come here! We always get the hummus falafel roll with hot sauce on the side. Delicious! I also tried their peppermint tea and baklava this time and loved both! A great spot to try if you are vegetarian.  Everything we tried was spot on! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Basis this review on a single take out visit...but was an OK experience.  The food is rather expensive for what it is.  They have a pretty wide menu with plenty of options, though you can't get small sides of items, which is frustrating...paying $7 for tabbouleh is silly.  The lamb rolled pita was decent - a little light on the meat, but decent...though I don't think I'd pay $8 for it again...  There are better places to go in the area...but isn't a bad place to try."}
{"text":"I thought the food was great, both my wife and I selected the same simple dish, a falafel salad. Just done well! Service was ok. I would give a 3 stars for that. But the value (the salad was About $9) and the quality make it a 4 star review."}
{"text":"I love the food here and the service is exceptional! They really know how to take care of their customers! Thank you Susie! I would recommend the Aladdin combo but everything on the menu is great!"}
{"text":"Very tasty Lebanese food. I got the Aladdin's sampler and I was happy I was able to try a little bit of a few things. If you're looking for a nice little restaurant with good Lebanese food that isn't too pricey, check this place out."}
{"text":"Always a great place to go when you want a good fair priced Mediterranean meal.  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Awesome take out  Fast and yummy! Great Mediterranean with lots of delicious vegan and vegetarian options as well as meat options!"}
{"text":"i love ethnic food and we happened to be in the plaza shopping where the restaurant is located.  i ordered the shish kabob.. the portion and price ratio wasn't balanced.. There was two skewers that barely had any meat and the size of the meat was so small.  The skewers that you buy at giant eagle's meat dept is bigger than this and the price was almost 20 +.  it wasn't worth the price you were getting and the quality was average at best"}
{"text":"Good as usual, not amazing but certainly gets the job done. A few of the girls serving are kind of strung out looking but as of yet it hasn't affected the service, so fuck it. Spicy kafta roll is good"}
{"text":"The chicken was dry, the pita was cold and there was a fly in my water.  I've had better food at other Aladdin's locations, so maybe this was just a bad day for them."}
{"text":"Meal (*****): I ordered the Jasmine Lamb plate over the phone, and I was offered yoghurt and hot sauce. I gladly accepted the offer. Once I got the box back to my abode, I saw a decent portion of tender little lambingtons, sitting in rows, waiting for me to shepherd them into my stomach. The meat and the rice were perfect and perfectly seasoned and spiced. It was a different and welcomed sense experience apart from my usual routine!  Ambiance (*****): For being in an Ohio strip mall, it is charming, the people are beautiful, and it smelled like perfume.  Service (*****): No patronizing here - paid, got my food, and I was on my way!"}
{"text":"Great eats! Vegan and vegetarian friendly.  The falafel and hummus are to kill for."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Significant number of vegetarian items on the menu.  Great Service"}
{"text":"I never leave hungry! The food is always quick, hot, and so very delicious! The staff here are a fantastic group as well - very inviting and happy to explain any part of the menu. Perfect for vegans and non-vegans alike. One of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed aladdin's.  it's aladdin's, for goodness sake. this is, i believe, my favorite Cleveland restaurant in existence.  Their menu is expansive, they offer healthy but delicious food, and they have good smoothies and desserts, too.  Soups and chilis are perfect for a cold winter day, full of flavor and very filling.  For hot, humid, summer days they have pita creations with a bunch of options to go with it. If you live in cleveland and have not yet been to an aladdin's (there are several throughout the area), get yourself there now.  you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Friday night marked my first real taste of what Hudson's palette had to offer and I was not disappointed. I had never really been out in downtown Hudson to eat except for Chipotle, so I decided to try out Aladdin's Eatery. Why Aladdin's one might ask. And to that, one might answer, 'because I'm tired of the mundane, quintessential American diet, getting enough of that everyday'. So walking back from my Friday night excursion to Acme, I stayed clear from Flip Side, Jimmy Johns, and Gionnini's, and instead opted to enter Aladdin's Eatery. From my first step, I felt welcomed by both the warm ambiance, the friendly waiter, and the atmosphere.  I was seduced by the spices in the wafting air and enraptured by the offers on their menu. I ordered the special of Chicken Mishwi, which was both succulent and beautifully flavored (for a great bargain of ~12$).  This came upon a bed of flavored brown rice, a healthy side of Mediterranean salad, and a nice serving of rich, creamy hummus - which had the balance of tahini sauce and olive oil just right. It can be safe to assume that I will definitely be coming back here again. My only qualm: no customer loyalty program nor free giveaways."}
{"text":"Great service and food, a theme that is consistent with all Aladdin's Eateries.  Best part about this restaurant is how late they are open, most often until 10pm on weeknights. Got exactly what I was craving too: a well bodied glass of red wine, and a falafel platter with hummus, moussaka, tabouli, and tzi tzi with pita bread on the side.  Deserts always look amazing, and I overheard the waiter explaining the different kinds of cakes and cookies and pastries. Some were even gluten free, the cheesecake I believe.   A wonderful mediterranean meal in the middle of Ohio."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place, probably without equal, for vegans and vegetarians to eat. Their baba ganoosh is excellent, as well as their falafel. And at about $6 a piece, their wraps can't be beat either. Also, try their soups. Any choice there is a winner, whether you eat meat or not."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Aladdin's for several years now. I usually get the 'flavor savor' which has a trio of different items to try. The hummus and rolled grape leaves are good too. They always have fresh and tasty food."}
{"text":"Afraid I can't and will not ever come back to Aladdin's. My experience started with continually being put on hold while trying to get a place a takeout order. After I picked up the food and drove home, I discovered that half of what was ordered wasn't present in the bag. When I called, and spoke to the manager, my options were to either come back in to pickup the food, or he could put my name down for a future credit. I asked that my credit card be credited for the order and was told I had to be physically present in order to do that. I'm very disappointed in this entire experience. I'm left with no choice but to call my credit card company to dispute the transaction. Terrible customer service!!"}
{"text":"My family is absolutely Bonkers when it comes to middle eastern Cuisine. We love Thai, Indian, Pakistanian, etc, etc.... If it has spice, we love it.   My parents had eaten at some of the other Aladdins locations in the greater Cleveland area and been very happy. We were ecstatic to find one located just two minutes away from our hotel room this weekend, so we piled into the car and off we went, happily anticipating a wonderful meal.  The Appetizers were great, which is why I gave this place any stars at all. I had the kibbie, which was fantastic, and the salata it came with was delish. My mother got the stuffed grape leaves, also fantastic, and the V-nine vegeatable soup my father had was amazing. My mother ordered an amazing natural energy raw juice thing that looked like poop and tasted like ambrosia.  Unfortunately, it all went down hill from there.  When our entrees arrived, My mother and I (who had ordered the same thing) were dismayed to find that our rice was cold. Thinking on the bright side, we moved our seasoned lamb (which was the right temperature) onto our salad plates so it wouldn't be overcooked in the re-heating and waited patiently for our waitress to come check on us. since there were only two tables in the place including ours, we figured it wouldn't take long. As we waited, we also noted that she hadn't cleared anyone's appetizer plates away, and the table was a little crowded. No problem, we thought, she will get it when she comes.....  If she comes.....  i finished my wine. A big pet peeve of mine is an empty glass at a restaurant. iIshould never run out of water, wine, whatever. At ten percent left, you better come over and ask if I want another.  Still no waitress. We could hear the hysterical laughter of four or five women coming from the kitchen.  No waitress.  Finally, my mother, who is in poor health, had to get up from the table and go INTO THE KITCHEN to get our waitress because she couldn't get their attention screaming at them over the counter through the doors.  When she got back there and said we would like our waitress, the girl cocked her bimbo head to the side, chomped her gum and stupidly asked....\"uhh....why?\"  Really. She did. I was there.  We had to remind her to take away the dishes, she forgot my wine and the rice came back almost lukewarm.   After this stellar service, my very mild mannered and ultimately polite father got up to pay the bill, and explained to the proprieter why he was reluctant to leave a tip. He was informed that (get this) the waitress had told her we were rude and Argumentative. The proprieter had actually not only listened to this babblecrap coming from an obviously incompetent 16 year old, she actually had the audacity to REPEAT IT TO HER CUSTOMER!!!! How dare she accuse my sweet natured parents of being rude just because we wanted our hot food to be hot, our glasses to be replenished and our dirty dishes to be cleared away?? Even after retrieving our service from the kitchens, my parents were still polite, saying plase and thank you and smiling.   YOU WILL NOT TALK TO MY PARENTS THAT WAY!!!!!  The food was mediocre, the service was piss-poor and the ambience was lacking. I'm not impressed, and i would never choose to line the pockets of such poorly mannered scumbags.  SO THERE!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. I try to stay away from chain restaurants, but I will make an exception for this place. They have the best hummus and their house salad dressing is amazing. Not the mention the spectacular desserts they offer. I will never say \"no\" to eating at Aladdins."}
{"text":"Eh- The hostess who would have been our waitress ignored and glared at us upon our entering up until she showed us to a table. We felt uncomfortable and puzzled, so we left before ordering. This has never happened to me before! I work in the industry, and understand everyone has bad days and customers can be rude. But this was unreasonable- given that I thought we were pretty pleasant! Nothing against the food- I'll probably just go to a different location."}
{"text":"Great! Light and healthy does not have to be dull and plain. We had the lamb plate and hummus pati. Both are good"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and many vegetarian options. We love the humus and their hot sauce. The prices are a little high, but you their humus is much better than anything you will find at a super market."}
{"text":"I seriously love Aladdin's. You can never go wrong with food from here. Whether it is a wrap, a salad, some hummus, some tabouli, or even a piece of cake, it is so good. And it's across the board at all locations, just not any one in particular. I have never had a bad meal here (and hopefully I did not just jinx it). Even when they seem like they are crowded, the food always comes out in a timely manner, and it is never cold (unless it's supposed to be). I've also recently started getting carryout here as well, which takes my love for Aladdin's to a whole new level."}
{"text":"Customer service is always on point except for today. If I hand my card to you, hand it back to me, it's rude to sit it on the counter when my hand is out. This behavior coming from the manager...tsk tsk tsk.. The other young lady was very nice and made me a tasty juice."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and delicious. I am from the middle east and I have being is so many other middle eastern restaurants but so far this one is the best. I am visiting this area and I am so glad I got to eat here."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and checked in frequently.  We asked and got the free hummus from checking which was great. Ordered the falafel wrap which was fantastic!! Couldn't be happier having stopped in. Will be returning soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Good food at a decent price. Try their pita pizza and you will pleasantly surprised. Been here quite a few times for lunch and its been great so far."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.   like it. I can't complain. The side salad was delicious (love the dressing) and the falafel was pretty good. Also, the hummus portion was enormous and I liked the pita it came with.  I love me some smoothies, so I had to try one. Not sure if I made the right choice in ordering one with raspberries because of all the seeds, but that was my own fault. However, I didn't like it that much.  Service was kinda lackluster, but still fine. She got the job done even though we could tell she totally hated her job."}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's. Aladdin's is one of the healthier options in the local restaurant scene. With so many chains selling food loaded with so many calories, Aladdin's is a nice respite from it all.  Some of the dishes I enjoy are the Lamb Rolled Pitas, the Fattoush Salad with Chicken, the hummus, the tabbouleh, and the baba ganoush. The selection of food is really pretty different from what's offered everywhere else, so I wouldn't be afraid to go in and try a few things.  The prices are very reasonable, although I think Dinner is actually a better value than lunch. You can also read my earlier reviews, everything still holds true a few years later!  Recommended!"}
{"text":"This is always our \"go to\" spot. We always know we will have a good and healthy meal. The staff and service are excellent. A very extensive menu no matter what you are in the mood for. The Baba is THE best! This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Food is very good here. However the service the last 2 times we went was not.  Order was mixed up the last time we went and this time service was poor.  Our to go order was supposed to come with pita bread. When we got home and opened the bag, no pita bread."}
{"text":"A consistently good place to go for authentic, delicious Middle Eastern food.  Always, always dependable.  Every single person we came in contact with was friendly and helpful.  Keeps us coming back over and over again."}
{"text":"They have some superb and very affordable food here - curry chicken pitza is my favorite"}
{"text":"The food is mostly tasty but way voerpriced for the quality. Try the med grill a few blocks down. Much better."}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's food but had never had it in the actual restaurant until a couple of days ago.    It was amazing!  I wasn't too opposed to spending around $7 on a salad because I had a feeling the falafel would be awesome...and it was!  The service was great as well.  We never ran out of water, but our waiter didn't \"bug\" us either.  One small hang up was that my friend ordered chicken chili and she ended up with chili.  Our waiter noticed and apologized profusely--it wasn't that big of a deal to her anyways.  Overall, I'm excited to go back! I cleaned my plate and totally didn't feel bad about it--who would after an amazing heaping salad and great falafel?!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Good quality Lebanese food. Really good and quick for lunch."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat for two reasons- the prices and the food! So delicious. The wraps , or pita rolls, are very good. My favorite is the chicken curry. My boyfriend loves the turkey roll. Lately I have been ordering the jasmine rice with beef shwarma. So good. And not terrible for you. Make sure to get it with the complimentary yogurt. Of course you must order the pita and hummus as an appetizer. And the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Still haven't dined in, but their take out has been hitting the spot. I just place an order for a pita wrap and it's ready to be picked up in ten to fifteen minutes. I wouldn't mind dining in, the restaurant is clean and the staff are great, but my place is minutes from here.  Usually there is a parking spot available in front of the restaurant. If not, the lot behind the store is a really short walk, if you park in the right place in the garage.   I have had the falafel wrap, add garlic sauce and hot sauce (my fav from Dolce). I have to say, Dolce has them beat on this particular menu item. Their lamb pita roll wasn't bad, but mine had a lot of veggies and a little bit of meat. The veggies were too overpowering for me without the right ratio of meat. The Shistawook, with chicken, garlic sauce and veggies is something I would definitely order again. I always get a side of their housemade hot sauce which goes really nicely with this. Finally, the award for the best pita roll goes to.... (drum roll)... Aladdins Kabob Roll. Just beef and veggies with tahini sauce. Just a perfect pita roll, this one can do no wrong.  Good luck getting out the door without indulging in some fresh cake (7 options), cheesecake (4 options), pastries, brownies or cookies. They are all displayed by the register and I can never resist. I have had the blueberry cassata cake (next), the Aladdins signature chocolate cake (fine) and my fav, baklava. Coming from a (half) Greek woman and a major Greek food snob, it's the best baklava I have had at a restaurant, ever."}
{"text":"I went here the other night with my boyfriend, and it was an overall good experience. The waiter, Alex, was very nice and friendly. I got a hummus and falafel rolled pita, and it came out very quickly. It was good, but I wouldn't say it was 'amazing'. The lady next to us had some complaints about her meal, but she seemed to be confusing (complaining her food was cold after she had waited 10 minutes to eat it). The same waiter was very accommodating to her. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Awesome food and staff. Every time!! Lentil soup is delicious. Hummus is amazing. Fresh!!  I am a long time customer and will continue to enjoy Aladdin's weekly!!"}
{"text":"Aladdin's has been a Cleveland favorite of mine for a couple of years.  Very tasty and reasonable for a chain middle eastern restaurant.  Big plus for having a decent selection of beer and wine.  You can't go wrong with many of the entrees, salads and desserts there.  Just keep it simple.  I know in some parts of the midwest, cheese on something makes it extra special, but not on my lentil soup.  If I want a quick, inexpensive healthy bite to eat, w/ a beer or wine, this is the spot in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favorite places to eat. They have a great vegan menu and everything is marked so you know what's vegan/vegetarian/not. The food is great too!   I've had the humus falafel rolled pita and the tabouli salad pocket, which is literally a salad in a pita so be prepared when you see it. I was surprised when I saw it, and I didn't know the best way to eat it.   If you have a hankering for middle eastern food or are vegetarian/vegan come here."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always fresh and the menu is very different than any other restaurant in the area. Their hot sauce is to die for and you must check out the dessert cooler! I also enjoy going to Aladdin's in the summer time and sitting outside. Would certainly recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Good vegetarian fare - friendly service and generous portions. The desserts didn't seem fresh off the block, solid 3 nonetheless"}
{"text":"My first yelp event was amazing!  What a great group!!  Meeting Cara & Russa was awesome. Now the food was delicious, the samples consisted of a walnut salad, pizza,hummus w/ hot sauce & pita , healthy smoothie & carrot cake. ( with unbelievable large portions). Thanks YELP & Aladdins for an enjoyable evening & excellent service."}
{"text":"Love this chain. The hummus is fresh, the steak shawarma is juicy. There are iced and hot teas and a variety of smoothies, and the menu has a nice selection varying from lighter fare, like wraps, to favorite entrees, like the hummus shawarma. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pittsburgh \"watering holes\"! Love that it's all fresh Whole Foods!!"}
{"text":"Tried the Chicken Fatoush Salad which had smaller pieces of chicken than the first time, slopped together & drowning in oil.  The pita is bland, flat not fluffy & stale.    Our server was less than happy to be there along w/ the other employees as though they were all upset at each other.  I asked her for a Rosé she came back & said they were out, no problem cause the Pinot Grigio was better than what I had the first time here.    After I finished, all of the staff was sitting down for a meeting in the middle of the restaurant as if they were resolving the issue at 1pm in the middle of lunchtime.  Strange.   The cakes look amazing & maybe that's what I should've had for lunch.  I eat at Mediterranean, Greek, Turkish & Lebanese restaurants all of the time & can truly say that I've had better in the food court at the Galleria Mall in Henderson, NV.    Not wasting my appetite here again.  I do not think that Independence, Ohio has excellent Mediterranean food to compare excellent from what is horrible.  Second restaurant on the same street that gets one star."}
{"text":"I live very near by and that is one of the reasons why I eat here often. The place is nice but not for a single person. I always feel like they are not so welcoming to single customers.   The food, the most important ingredient, is nice. It is not exceptional like in every chain restaurant, it is okay and good sometimes. They have a good selection and many vegetarian options. I can not speak for meat eaters but I have had better vegetarian food in other places.   Place is clean and nice to go out and have a good dinner. Don't expect large portion size or great taste, something that you can have if you don't want cook at home."}
{"text":"Three of us came for lunch today. The water was off in Chagrin Falls where our office is located so that led us to try a place outside of the village.   We were seated promptly when we entered at about 12:30. The place was pretty empty. The dessert display was quite tempting looking. We did not try it on this visit, mostly due to time.   The server was very prompt with menus and drinks, and offered hummus as an appetizer which we declined. We took our time reviewing the very extensive menu. Decided to order three pitza varieties to share and a spinach feta pastry to share. Pitza bc it's a pizza made on a pita. Prices were good with pitza at $7.75 each if I recall. We waited.... and waited..... a looooooong time. I mean, a very looooooooooooong time. Almost an hour. Not good for a workday lunch! We were one of only two tables waiting for food too, so have to wonder if anyone was working the kitchen... but then finally our food arrived and looked delicious.   If only it had been hot. Disappointingly it was barely warm. Like it had all been sitting for a while. After waiting forever, in an almost empty restaurant.  No idea why...  The beef shawarma pitza was ok. Beef was tender. Yogurt tahini sauce was nice. Nothing special. The Ali baba pitza was better. Flavors worked. But again it was not hot. The chicken curry pitza was the star. Delicious sweet honey mustard sauce, though a bit too much of it, complemented the curry chicken and crispy fried onions. This would be worth a return visit ... if it had been warm. The spinach thing was meh. Not flaky as expected , the thick heavy layers of dough killed it.   I would be willing to try this place again for the chicken curry pitza and possibly dessert if they get their kitchen issues fixed so that food is served promptly and hot. The three stars is generous due to the nice server and potential to improve."}
{"text":"Stopped off from a meeting, first time ever at an Alladins and I am wondering why it took me so long to finally stop. From the service to the food quality I was a very happy lunch patron. Keep it up! Try the hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Aladdin's never disappoints. Awesome options for vegetarians. I eat here at least once a week. Everything tastes very fresh. Service is always wonderful and fast, I don't think I've ever waited longer than 15-20 minutes for food to come out. It's also very affordable. Thank you for taking me on a magical carpet ride; a whole new world indeed."}
{"text":"Good was amazing and very fresh. Cute attentive and helpful staff. Great find while out during business trip."}
{"text":"We loved the food. Our server Matthew was awesome. Was very attentive. Ask for him. The food is excellent. Enjoyed the fattoush salad. Great flavor. Added chicken for $2.50. Will probably do double chicken next time. Hummus was also very good. Definitely recommend and will come back."}
{"text":"Gosh- what can I say? Fantastic And savory middle eastern fare at great prices. Love all things here but my all time favorite is the chicken salad pita and the V nine soup. Love it here ."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the deliciousness of the beef shawarma roll and a fruit smoothie.  Also had some hummus and falafel from a platter.  The hummus and falafel were good,  but a bit bland.  The roll was just delicious.  Loved the pickled vegetables in it. It was also super filling and very reasonably priced. Lots of parking and good service"}
{"text":"The food and service here is great!  I had a sampler plate with Jasmin's rice and salad and it was very tasty and a large portion too. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in the area."}
{"text":"This review has to give serious props to the hot sauce.   I should start out by sayingI'm a fan of the hummus. I like a garlicky hummus any time, but order this bad boy with a large side of their flavorful hot sauce and mix it in; it's phenomenal. Their hot sauce isn't like the angry orange bottle of Frank's Red Hot that you're picturing (though I love that stuff too); it's a complex mix of peppers and just the right amount of heat. I swear by the stuff. I've been known to order a large side of it and save it, using the rest as a marinade for chicken for another night's dinner.  Other than the aforementioned hot sauce which pairs perfectly with the hummus, there are several dishes I love to order here. For an inexpensive lunch, try one of their soups. All of them are fabulous, from the V-Nine (nine different vegetables), to the Chicken Lentil-Chili. The soups come in a huge steaming bowl, and are definitely a meal in themselves.  Another favorite dish of mine is the Shishtawook Rolled. My man and I will often order this one in tandem, because that \"famous garlic sauce\" will stay with you. But it is so worth it and so flavorful. I never thought I would enjoy pickled turnips, but they add a bright, tart crunch to the dish.  A vegetarian favorite is their Mujadara plate, perfectly cooked and seasoned lentils and rice topped with crunchy carmelized onions. This is a wonderful dish to share. It's delicious and filling.  Aladdin's has great food. I've never been disappointed at any of their locations. Give it a try sometime, especially if you're looking for a new vegetarian option; there's lots of deliciousness to discover here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have wanted to try this restaurant for a long time, and we finally made it.  We were shown our table and before we were even seated we were asked what we wanted to drink, which I thought very unusual.  We gave our waitress our selections.  She came back promptly and asked if we were ready to order, which we weren't since they have many dishes on their menu and this was our first time there.  She seemed put off by this since we weren't ready when she was.    When we made a decision on our meals, she was busy with other tables, which is fine. When she came back, my wife ordered the beef shawarma, and I had the falafel appetizer.  She never checked on us at to see if we wanted more tea or water.  I want to point out that restaurant was not busy, there were only 13 customers, including ourselves.  There were a total of 3 or 4 waitresses at the time, so it is not like they were slammed or anything.  When our order came, she never checked on us again to see if everything was ok. Another waitress came and asked about our order, but by that time it was not relevant.   My falafel was ok, just not my cup of tea., so I left it.  The beef shawarma was very good.  The portion was huge, enough for 2 or 3 meals, so we took the rest home.  It took some time for our waitress to come back to the table to give us a take home container and the bill.  She had to be flagged down by one of her co-workers to take care of us.  I just think that the priorities they have as far as their duties doesn't include taking care of their customers first and foremost.  Cleaning and setting up tables seemed to be a priority over customer service and satisfaction. Their menu looks interesting, and I am sure very good by the very many positive reviews I read before going there.   No matter how good their food may be, the dining experience was ruined by the inattentive waitress.  I only gave them a one star due to service we received, not for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Great place for takeout:  stuffed grape leaves, humus, tabouleh, Lebanese insalata, etc.  Their spinach pie isn't made with phyllo dough. .. it is in a pita.  Beware:  they are very generous with the pita bread ... ask for 1/2 portion of pita which comes with most orders.  It will be very hard to not pick one of each item in the dessert case."}
{"text":"Review update:  Unfortunately, I have to update this place to a 3 star review. The last two times I went now, slow service and the falafels themselves seemed like they had been sitting out on the counter for quite some time before being microwaved and reserved. They are just not meant to have a rubbery skin on them!   Disappointed, but hopefully this place will redeem itself."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad at all.  I wouldn't rate it as the highlight of Mediterranean eateries, but it's solid for a chain-like store.  I mean, I would rather go somewhere else more genuine, but if I had to do this.. I wouldn't hesitate one bit because it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Food is great!  I have no complaints -- a healthy size portion, solid service, and delicious food; I would give 5 stars .. but i was just not blown away with the food.  But I would definitely go again, and again...  and in time I can easily imagine it jumping to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Mention if it is your first time at Aladdin's. They will bring out a sampler of the apps.   It is a casual cafe type restaurant with healthy options. They also have wine, beer, and smoothies. Their dessert counter is very tempting...they have those deli style GIANT cakes like Max's used to have in Rocky River.   Everything here is excellent, however, these are my old favorites:   Len-chili soup with feta  chicken salad salad with feta  stuffed grape leaves  hummus (If you can't eat the pita, they will bring out an assortment of veggies...specify what veggies otherwise you will get a bunch of pickled options). Add a bit of hot sauce, but it is Hot!   FYI: It has been a few years since I last tried one of the wraps, but I believe they now put beets in them. You will definitely want to check on that if you don't like surprises in your wraps."}
{"text":"Great place for a late night snack with lots of well-marked vegan options. This is a kind of cheap and cheerful place, although service was very friendly.   Opted for a rolled naan, which proved to be a bit too crispy (slightly soft would have been better), and somewhat tasteless. It also had unadvertised beets which I had to remove.   Still, scores for price and clarity, with lots of options to try and maybe one or two passable beers."}
{"text":"I absolutely love aladdins! I have been to two of the locations, in hudson and akron. I can not wait for the newest location in Cuyahoga falls to open. I've never had a bad experience at their locations. My favorites are the foule(Lebanese bean dish that you eat with pita) , dawali(stuffed grape leaves), and the chicken shawarma wrap. Today I ordered the wrap and the dawali. The dawali comes with 6 stuffed grape leaves and is covered with feta and olive oil/lemon. They give you pita slices on the side, but there's really no need for it. I also got my favorite chicken shawarma wrap with a side of hot sauce. The meat is perfectly seasoned and has a smoked flavor, better than any chicken shawarma I have had from any other Mediterranean restaurant. I normally do not like \"chain-ish\" restaurants, but I love their food above any others. You can always count on consistency of their hummus and baba ganoush, which I've had a problem with at smaller family owned restaurants. I love how they have fresh juices.   ** I almost gave today's visit 4 stars because of the service I experienced on the phone. I placed a pick up order and the girl seemed distracted and at one point I heard her telling a coworker to polish the silverware better. I do appreciate polished silverware, but I just thought it was kind of rude to say while I was giving my order. When I picked up, the girls were nice and the food was excellent as always so I just gave 5 stars due to the good service I've had on previous visits.   * if you're in hudson, give aladdins a try, it will not disappoint, the food is fresh, authentic, and a great alternative to burgers and pizza."}
{"text":"I've tried the lamb-roll pita sandwich here which was quite good, and the chicken sambusek roll, which is incredibly-out-of-this-world!! Well, maybe that just had to do with my Indian palate, but I'd return here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Their kofta balls are good and the pistachio cheesecake was delicious, the wait staff were very sweet and considerate. The restaraunt it's self was not as authentic as I was hoping for."}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Ohio for a wedding and found this place to have lunch and wow was that the best discussion we made the food is out standing the service is great. If you are feeling mediterranean then don't look anywhere else this is 100% good quality food. It's sad that we probably will never eat here again but we will carry this memory for ever."}
{"text":"Get the Flavor Savor special. $7.99 for 1.5 buttloads of food, that's pretty healthy, too. It's a round trip meal, you start with the hummos and finish with it. In between you're loving those two generously-sized beef kafta, tender, mildly seasoned chicken, a side salad and their light and fluffy rice, that makes you feel like you're being rocked to sleep by grandma again.  What a bargain, folks.  Plus the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"I had a serious hankering for Middle Eastern food the other day and decided to check out Aladdin's upon a suggestion from a friend.  Let me first caveat this by saying I like my hummus dripping (and I mean dripping in garlic) so I found Aladdin's hummus to be extremely bland and actually a bit weird tasting.  The texture was fine but the taste was B flat.  The parsley on the dish was a bit 80s.  I was surprised that I had to clarify if I wanted white or dark meat chicken.  The grilled white meat chicken arrived barely warm.  I was bummed.  The hot sauce is very, very good so that made me happy.  This is a cute location facing Detroit Rd with tables in the windows.  Service was good.  Perhaps I caught them on an off day and will need to give them another chance!"}
{"text":"Very healthy, good wholesome food.  Love the Baba Gannouj! Typically, I get the Vegetarian Combo appetizer as my entree---can't pass up on the Dawali .  The mint tea is wonderful.  The kids menu great---even my picky eater found something.  The prices are a bit high, but you really do get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in the north hills for lunch.  I always get the wraps here because they're delicious and very cheap.  This time, I got the beef pita wrap and the falafel pita wrap.  I got both of these for under $14 and it filled me up.  I will continue to go here when I need a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I have been to this location just once and I did not find it as good as others. Our waitress was not very attentive and clearly overwhelmed. The food was good, but the location in Mayfield Village is much better."}
{"text":"Why haven't I reviewed this place yet? This was the first restaurant I visited even before I moved to CLE. I'm a regular here and I have never once been disappointed. Everything is fresh, the prices are fantastic, and it's right in my neighborhood.  Their baklava is definitely the best in CLE, and maybe even the best I've ever had? I have absolutely 0 complaints about this place. Love it. Great Lebanese food."}
{"text":"Great healthy place to go if you are in a hurry.  Service is quick and food is great.  Can't go wrong with the Lentil soup, any of the salads and the hummus is very good."}
{"text":"Great food for an affordable price! You have to try their hot sauce with thier hummus!"}
{"text":"this a place for people who never had real, flavorful middle eastern food. this place had such great reviews so I went to check it out and was greatly disappointed. their \"#1 sandwhich\" is the chicken shawarma. really? this chicken is suppose to be marinated overnight and cooked with the spices it was marinated in. this did not taste like any of that. I got the falafel sandwich which was a little better than the their supposedly #1 sandwich. this is not a place if ur looking for some great flavor and great mid eastern food. I'm not from Cleveland but try to steer far from this mediocre place."}
{"text":"Overall a good meal, however I have had better Shwarma at other restaurants. Hummus was tasty and accommodated our group of 10. Deserts looked wonderful although didn't have room to try any."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise!  Did not expect to find such wonderful tasty food in a strip mall.  The service is so attentive and friendly.  So much better than the local chain restaurants.  Had the Chicken and Hommus.  Fabulous!"}
{"text":"The food is very bland. I normally love food that somewhat healthy but this lacked seasoning in so many places. Also, I LOVE hummus but this just doesn't cut it when it is just mashed chickpeas. This was my second and last attempt at eating here. I really wanted to like this place but I just can't."}
{"text":"Been there twice over the past couple of weeks, once for lunch and once for dinner.  Didn't really matter as the menu was the same. Started with salads and hummus Both times and they were both very good. Had the falafel for lunch and the lamb for dinner and enjoyed both, especially the falafel.  Prices were very reasonable if not cheap. Overall I would say great value and very good food.   Only one thing keeping it from five stars- we ate outside and the patio was disgusting.  They have metal tables with a grid like pattern so food and drinks can spill through to the ground.  The problem is that if you look below every table there are stains on the bricks as if the place had never been washed.  I just couldn't get the stains out of my mind.  Just one pressure wash a year would solve the problem.  Wonder what does the kitchen look like?  Usually you can tell a lot about the kitchen from the bathroom but in this case after seeing the patio, I was afraid to go!   Overall give it a shot but eat inside and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Tasty, healthy, well seasoned food. Nice ambiance, good service. Have had several meals here and they are all tasty, lean, properly cooked, and well seasoned. Thier desert if very good as well.  But seriously they need a price reduction. Even when I carry out it's costly."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is our favorite go-to restaurant in the East End! We like to get the delicious hummus appetizer, which goes especially well with the unlimited pita bread. The menu has a variety of options including smoothies to shish kabobs, and more Mediterranean foods. The prices are reasonable, and the location is awesome. In addition, the waiters are always very friendly and attentive. Aladdin's is the perfect place for a casual family dinner, and I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"The Aladdins pizza is my favorite.  The food always tastes fresh and never leaves me feeling bogged down.  The hot sauce and hummus are delicious as well.  Every time I go there it is quality all around and I've gone over 20 times."}
{"text":"Service was really slow and they were not busy. My fattoush salad arrived with semi warm chicken on top.  The flavor of the salad rocked but it seems the kitchen and waitstaff are very lazy."}
{"text":"Everything was super fresh! Service was excellent. Would return in a heartbeat! The shish kabob and the Salad were my favorite! My kids enjoyed the pita and chicken :)"}
{"text":"Lengthy menu, large selection of vegetarian dishes. Great flavors."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the one in Squirrel Hill and was excited to try this one out with my date. What I love is they have a huge menu selection from pizzas to salads to full meals. I went with a wrap of hummus and lots of veggies with a side of their yogurt dressing. It is served warm and was very fresh. My date got the same wrap with lamb. Theses are perfect size for lunch and would recommend ordering something else if you get one for dinner. I wish we saved room for dessert as they have tons of speciality cakes.  Our waitress was great and it was not too crowded on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"Alladin's is a wonderful Middle Eastern restaurant with food available at good prices. I especially enjoy the Chicken Curry Rolled and Beef Shawarma Rolled. Unfortunately, however, Alladin's does not have WiFi, a feauture that most other restaurants of this caliber have. I would encourage this establishment to offer WiFi so that its clientele can be productive while waiting for food, etc. Besides this, I would not hesitate to recommend others to enjoy the cuisine available at Alladin's."}
{"text":"Always liked this location. The servers are always attentive and the food is always delicious and fresh. I always get their house mint tea with my meal and baba ganouj to mix in whatever entree I decide on. Lots of options on the menu, even kids enjoy it."}
{"text":"It's good food and service. I don't think they do anything different with hummus than anyone else but, if you like this type of thing, they are good. The food is fresh and high quality. I like it but don't love it."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  It has a very expansive menu that has at least one thing everyone would like.    My go to items are usually the hummus with pita (I will say as a small critique is that they need to give you more than 6 pieces of pita if you're getting it to go), The falaffel, the chicken curry pitza, and the chicken tawook salad.    I've been here both to dine in and carry out and they are very quick and courteous no matter how you get your food."}
{"text":"Wowwwy love this place ... It's got it all as a one stop shop for Lebanese food dolls and chaps...food, value, atmosphere, service, awesomeness!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times and have never once been disappointed.  Great food, atmosphere and service!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, with many healthy options. The service is always fast for dining in or take out. The baba is always fantastic and goes great with the fresh veggie crudités."}
{"text":"I stopped at Aladdin's Eatery on my way through Ohio and it was certainly a nice place. First the service was great - the waiter was unfailingly friendly, even when one of us first asked for ice and then asked not to have any ice.   In addition, the food itself was delicious. The falafels were great - as was the carrot smoothie, which, yes, was made of fresh carrots. I recommend this place as an inexpensive place to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing food! My sister and I came here for lunch a few days ago. Very diverse menu-vegeterian, vegan, and non veg options. My sister got a chicken curry pita wrap and loved it. I got a few things-vegetarian chili, falafel and hummus pita roll, and tomato stewed green beans (cant remember what theyre called). I intended to take some home but it was so delicious I could not stop eating until my plate was cleared. Great food and great price! Wish I lived closer so I could eat here every week."}
{"text":"Loved eating here when we lived in the Heights, hopping place.  Great food.  My son loved the smoothies."}
{"text":"Love this one as much as the one in Cleveland Heights.  Not as busy and often they have help issues.  Good consistent food."}
{"text":"Your manager, Laura, at your Crocker location is an angel. My grandmher passed away and I was suddenly hosting a large crowd at my home Sunday.  With less than 3 hours notice she was able to take care of a large order for 40 people perfectly and ease my mind.  She is fantastic at her job!  You are lucky to have her as an employee. My food was delivered on time and delicious.  Thank you Laura for handling this for me!"}
{"text":"Food: I get the same thing almost every time I go: the hummus with hot sauce and chicken lentil soup.  I sometimes switch it up with a pita.  The food is healthy but satisfying.  I have had a variety of their dishes, and I always like how they spice their meat.  The pita bread is also fresh.  Service:  No compliments or complaints.  Setup: The paper ring for the napkin and silverware generates an extra piece of trash.  The plates are sometimes unnecessarily large for the size of the tables.  The silverware can be a bit clunky too.  Overall:  A good place to go for a light lunch after a day out and about."}
{"text":"No visit to Lakewood would be complete without a meal (or 5) at my favorite Lebanese restaurant. Al the food I've had here is delicious, though my favorites are the baba ganoush and the baklava. They also have great fresh juices, my favorite of which is the Natural Energy. They currently have a special quinoa menu which I LOVE. Usually I have to force myself to eat the stuff but the salads are amazing. Try the Cranberry Walnut Quinoa or the Tabouleh/Quinoa/Kale salad. Both are outstanding! Service is efficiently friendly, and the atmosphere is casual and understated. Very relaxing place to meet a friend or eat solo. They also do take out, and the prices are not bad for the quality and quantity of the food. Before all the cool scenester places sprouted up, this restaurant was one shining spot on Detroit Ave - now it's one of numerous culinary options in Lakewood, but it remains one of the very best."}
{"text":"Good food for the price, very friendly staff.  Parking can be tricky, especially on the weekends. But I'd highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is purely amazing. You must have the lamb plate, lamb salad, Len-chili, beef kafta, any raw juices and smoothies, and any cake. You can't go wrong here...other than the wait for your food but it's worth it in the end."}
{"text":"Yikes. Maybe this was an \"off\" night, but they really dropped the ball. The service was terrible. They completely messed up our order, our food took an inordinate amount of time to arrive, and the staff were completely unapologetic about the situation. Not the best Mother's Day I've had."}
{"text":"Awesome service! A slight confusion mixup if we were dining in or taking out. Once the waitress GiGi noticed we wanted to dine in she quickly informed the chef to make our food dine in and jumped into action, making up for the miscommunication. Her customer service was exceptional as she offered us many different things, such as pita and waters for the road. She anticipated our needs. Before we left she gave us two free baklava pieces. The food was incredible as always. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, enough said. Small chain but good food. It doesn't take too long and everything tastes better each time I go. I'm happy there's a good place like this right around the corner.  The shawarma is my favorite. Along with any of the cheesecakes or cakes. Must visit!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Falafel was way over cooked, the wrap was a mess. Definitely the worst one I've been to by far. My husband and I got a cookie to share and it was probably about a week or more old. Won't visit again."}
{"text":"Happy Aladdin's client over here!  Had some friends over in early December before Christmas and picked up Aladdin's catering to go...ordered the hummus platter and the chicken mishwi platter.  The hummus platter was plentiful and we did not finish all of it split between 10 or more people,  It came with loads of pita bread too.  The pita bread was not made in-house.  They order it in bulk.  The chicken mishwi is served on rice and it was devoured!  It came with about 13-14 pieces of chicken and we probably should have ordered more.  Ordering was so easy...i called 3 days ahead and told them what time i would pick up....the manager brought everything to my car for me.  I tipped!  Next time will order less hummus, perhaps I will go with a couple orders, not the platter.  Needed more chicken mishwi.  That stuff is so dang good!  Overall, I love Aladdin's."}
{"text":"A great Middle Eastern Restaurant.  One of Lakewood's busiest restaurants. Had a Fatayer Plate.  Large sized pie stuffed with Spinach and Feta, with lemon and scallions!  One of my favs!  Topped off with a cool Raspberry Ice Tea!  Moderately price and more than ample servings!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot off McKnight Road. I wanted to give a higher rating but the Aladdin's Favorite Combo was just OK. I wanted more Mediterranean flavors in the proteins, in my opinion under seasoned.  With that said, I really enjoyed the Baba. It was delicious!!! Silky smooth and a must have. I'll be back to try it again."}
{"text":"I have nothing negative to say about this place. This is such a beautiful and clean establishment and I love the outdoor seating for beautiful days. Their wait staff is awesome. Many of them have been there along time. Doesn't seem like they have quick turnover which is great. Food is FRESH. They have all the classic middle eastern dishes and are made to perfection. Make sure you get hummus with a side of hot sauce (I could drink this it is so good). I've ordered almost everything off the menu. If you love garlic get the chicken pitza. Great vegetarian, low fat and low calorie options. Their homemade dressings are delicious, especially the cilantro vinegarette. Save room for a fresh smoothie or a homemade piece of cake. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"It was a bit tough to find a great vegetarian place in Pittsburgh that was open late enough for us on a Sunday night but I'm glad I looked long enough to find this place.   Andre was our server and he was really professional and quick. My friend and I ordered Dawali wraps which was our first encounter with dolma - he said it was the best Mediterranean wrap he's ever had. It was a little more sour and tangy than I was expecting but I'm not complaining, I'm still glad I tried it. The vegetarian chili has the perfect amount of heat and is a good size for sharing, or it could be a meal on its own for one person. No skimpy small cup of soup for sure.   The atmosphere is cozy with ambient music. Prices are incredibly reasonable for the amount of food you get. We spent less than $20 for a filling dinner and leftovers. It's really too bad this place is hours from home because we'd love to eat here often."}
{"text":"The codes on the menu are helpful in finding allergy free choices. Most gluten and dairy free choices were salads which are available everywhere. I had the lamb salad with the Aladdin dressing which was good. Our table was under the too cold air conditioning vent and also plagued with a too bright  stream of sunshine. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Exceptional food! We love the hummus and ALL of the _______ rolled (especially the lamb rolled!) I don't believe we have ever had a meal that was anything short of amazing!"}
{"text":"I would really like to enjoy food from Aladdin's more. It is relatively healthy and offers a lot of vegetarian options. For the price, it would like a little more. I usually order take out. The past couple times, I was disappointed to find my salads mostly just lettuce. For my last order, the pita took up about a third of the container. I never had the pita included inside the salad container. It seems like the prices are getting higher, while the food is getting scarce. Perhaps I will try again, but eat there instead."}
{"text":"Now that I've eaten at another med restaurant that was highly rated - I would say that Aladdin's in comparison does a much better job at making the food more flavorful . The rice pilaf was comfort food - really nice . The Pita bread was definitely from a grocery store! But the food itself was great The kebob platter and the fattoush salad was excellent . A small place but packs a punch with the food !"}
{"text":"Good food that is fresh and relatively healthy with service that is somewhat spotty.   Aladdin's is one of our favorite takeout spots in Squirrel Hill. The food is fresh and tasty with portions that are huge. I am a fan of their plates and pitzas, but I also love the salad options.   But to me Aladdin's really shines in appetizers. Our standard is the humus - a massive portion that filling and delicious (there is a small hint of lemon that makes the whole thing feel really bright and satisfying). But we also love the falafel and the loubie bzeit.   My only complaint is that whenever we eat in, the service is often spotty. Sometimes service is outstanding, while other times it seems as though our server forgets about us. My recommendation: order takeout (particularly if you have a tighter schedule)."}
{"text":"Their coffee saved them from two stars. Lentil soup was OK. No salt or pepper on the table. I also tried the Lebanese Salata (?) and that was pretty good. Waitress had nice personality but was not well versed on menu. I would have been much happier at the Panera Bread right next door at half the price."}
{"text":"This was a delightful experience!! The food was so awesome!!  Delicious hummus with a hot sauce on the side started my experience. The best part was the chicken shawarma!! OMG best I've tasted!! Tender pieces of chicken  with fresh crispy vegetables and a garlic dipped sauce to die for!! I'm not from this area but wish I could have this eatery near me in Orlando!!  I would be a regular patron!! Our waitress was friendly and made awesome suggestions! Fast friendly service with great tasting food what more could you ever as for!! I would highly suggest trying this place!!  They also have cakes and cookies! HUGE cookies and beautiful cakes are the firsts thing you see after walking through the door!! Try Aladdin's Eatery!!"}
{"text":"First time at this particular Aladdin's.  We came in late, around 10:30 pm, and were the last ones out. Got great service and great food. We went tapas style with all appetizers and chicken chili. Their dawali, stuffed grape leaves for the unitiated, are the best. Simply perfection. I wish we could get food like this in Fort Wayne."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went here the day it opened and have been returning ever since.  All natural and affordable to most.  Great selection of Lebanese food, excellent juiced and dessert as well.  Glad this company has grown to be what it is. Staff is always attentive & friendly."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I've been to a few locations, and the food is always predictably delicious.  My significant other complains that everything could use just a little more seasoning, but I'm always happy with it.  I love love love the falafel.  I love it in wraps, on pizzas, and in salads.  The appetizers are great too!  Foole M Damas is AMAZING (Puree of fava beans, garlic, extra virgin olive oil and lemon topped with diced tomatoes and parsley. Pita on the side) You must try it.    The iced tea is amazing as well and they have a nice little beer menu if you prefer some alcohol.  The atmosphere is relaxed and casual and the servers are always very attentive."}
{"text":"Raving review about this place. Having tasted Halal Cart and also living in the Mediterranean community in California, I have tasted the authentic cuisine. I came here on a Wednesday night, quiet packed ambiance, flowing with customers coming in and out. What a great sight to know that there is flux in this place. Portage Triangle is a neutral place to meet people, since they offer so many option. I opted for this one and I ordered Beef Shawarma Jasmine Plate. The beef shawarma was savory, marinated with herbs and spices, could particularly taste the star-anise and cardamom pops, however lacking the umami flavor.  A little salt or mushroom broth wouldn't hurt! While my friend ordered chicken curry roll, she mentioned that it tasted ok, but not like suprising foodgasm. Overall, experience was 5, food was meh, 4, could be better! Perhaps, my shawarma just needed a little more salt. I will attempt it again at another time and update my review!! Great ambiance for a date!"}
{"text":"I am currently pregnant and was looking for a healthy option; full restaurant and waited only moments for a table. Waiter (although obviously swamped) was quick, attentive and everything was perfect. Great sized portion of hummus as a starter and the pitza that I had was perfection! I've been before but never sent a review and after such a great experience thought it warranted five stars! Bon Appétit."}
{"text":"I love this place but haven't been in a very long time. I was on the road for work and stopped here for lunch.  I got the berry smoothie, tabouli and Greek chicken salad. Wayyy too much food for 1 person, but everything was so good!  The only reason they're not getting 5 stars is because there is no lunch menu.  Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"While I haven't been to Aladdin's since I started my GF diet, it has always been a place that everyone in the house could find something they liked to eat.  I was a Pescetarian for a long while, and now my bro is a vegetarian.  With their huge menu and tons of vegetarian options, this was a wonderful place to eat.   My usual varied.  For a long time it was the Aladdin's Falafel rolled, but then it was the Fatayer (spinich pie) appetizer with a side salad, no salata (I am not a big fan of raw tomato).  More recently it was the Turkey rolled or the Chicken Curry Rolled.  Sadly, none of these are now options for me given my condition, but I can tell you that they are all very delicious.  Aladdin's has some wonderful soups that are very filling, huge salads, and yummy smoothies with fresh squeezed juices, fruits, and fat free yogurt.  They have Pitzas with various Mediterranean flairs, and lots of plates that include a salad as part of the dish.  Not everything is healthy, but you can generally find something for every taste.  And if you can save room for desert, do.  They have a huge case of giant tortes, cheesecakes, and bombs, but they also have an assortment of backlavas and homemade cookies."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, and the mint tea is a definite must. I had the Shwarma Pitza and it was very good. The portions are large and relatively inexpensive. My reason for only giving three stars, however, was the poor service. After we ordered, he asked what side we wanted with our meal--in my experience when waiters ask this, it means that the side is included in the meal. However, when I got my bill, I was surprised to see I'd been charged for it. Not a huge deal and I probably should've read the menu more thoroughly, but it did feel like a bit of a rip off. Just something to be aware of. I will still definitely be back for the yummy food!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem and my weekly take-out spot.  I've been a fan of Aladdin's over 10 years, including their Cleveland locations. This speaks volumes about their consistency and quality of food.  My favorites are the fattoush salad, pita rolls, lentil soup and falafels. I'm not a fan of every dish, but the  majority is pretty good and healthy. Good vegan options.  Nice variety of desserts(Cakes!!!) Prices are reasonable.   Quick grab a bite type place- casual vibe."}
{"text":"I used to live down the street from this Aladdin's. Tuna shawarma, veggie chili, falafel, it was all consistently great."}
{"text":"Excellent pockets but I wouldn't have the baklava cheesecake again. Stick to the more regular types."}
{"text":"My mum, my dad, and I went to Aladdin's Eatery and found so many things.   First our drinks were very good. My mum got (hot) mint tea, along with my dad. They both would think 4/5 stars for the tea. I got Raspberry iced tea and it was very sweet. Like a kind of surprising sweet. But still good. 4/5 stars.  Our appetizer was AMAZING! 5/5 stars. We got the falafel.    The meal Was amazing, I can't even put it in words. But it definitely filled me up. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday with my sister. Nice friendly service, warm and welcoming environment, and good assortment of tasty dishes. Best hummus I've ever had.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"If I could give them 6 stars I would. I've walked into a few different Aladdins eateries around the Cleveland area and have had the same great customer service in all of them.   They are located in the Crocker Park shopping area, great location if you ask me.   As we walked inside, we were greeted promptly and seated pretty quick.  Our waitress was great and courteous. She brought out our drinks within a few mins and then proceeded to take our order.   My wife ordered the Mujadara Power salad- I think I ate half of it, one of the best and most flavorful salads that I have ever ate. They do bring out a side of dressing to go with the salad, but with the award winning hummus that they put on top of the salad, dressing is not needed. The combination of all the ingredients that go into the salad are delicious, I highly recommend this salad.   I ordered the the Aladdins Chicken pizza and I don't regret it one bit.  The sauce and all the ingredients on the pizza are pitalicous-server on pita bread. The pizza is over loaded on chicken and the honey dressing they put on top makes it even stand out more.  Definitely one of my favorite items on the menu.  Stop reading and head over here.   Disclosure- I don't own any shares/percentage of this company.  I just love there food."}
{"text":"Always great food and great service! We love bringing people here who haven't been here before - they always want to come back!   Staff is always really friendly and they know the menu well. That menu is soooo long that it's intimidating, even for people who know Mediterranean food. It's great to have staff who can give advice."}
{"text":"My wife and I were taken here by her brother, sister in law, and their kids on Memorial Day, on our way into Cleveland proper.  Happy surprise:  the food was excellent, from the table appetizer (Foole M Damas, a lemony fava bean concoction) to the basic yet savory-sweet Aladdin's chicken pitza, featuring honey dijon dressing, garlic sauce, julienned peppers, and juicy chunks of grilled chicken.. My wife seemed pleased with her falafel salad, although I wouldn't know, as I was on baby duty, at the time.  By the time she dug in, I was across the street at Dave's Market.attempting to distract my son.    Not sure when we'll be back in the area, but given the quality, value and quantity of food, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! The Greek pitza and the chicken pitza are my favorites. I love the tawook salad too and the chicken salad. Everything is fresh and I don't feel  crappy after I eat it. Even if I get dessert. It is expensive but tastes so fresh. So so good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at Aladdins twice and both times we were extremely pleased with the food quality, friendly staff, and overall experience. The first time we ate here was after a long day of apartment shopping since we are new to the area. We ordered the appetizer sampler plate and some kebabs of lamb and rice. I don't remember what the dishes were called but it was excellent! We also ate here for dinner the fist day we officially moved into our apartment and were so pleased that Aladdins is just 2 walking blocks from us! I have a feeling we will be going here a lot... :) I got the Kibbie plate and my husband ordered one of the wraps with steak and it was sooo good! I will definitely order a wrap next time. Overall, this place has a wide variety of healthy and tasty food, casual comfortable atmosphere, friendly service, and plentiful portions. So happy it is in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Was strolling the area and came here for a light late night bite. The food was very well seasoned and fresh. We loved the dawali (grape leaves) appetizer and hummus and falafel rolled pita. Pita on the side was freshly made, even as one of the late night patrons. Would definitely go back and try all the other amazing looking items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Tons of awesome healthy options. Excellent antidote to the crappy fast food choices when driving down I-80. And VERY affordable!"}
{"text":"I came here Bc last time we got a to go order it came with no bread. I did ask for it. It probably seems weird that that's such a big deal but for Lebanese food it really is. I called and they were so polite about it and gave me that same order for free. Very professional.   I came in and we got: Tabouleh, Lentil soups and Grape leaves. Everything was awesome I really liked the soup.   Also idk if any other reviewers have mention this but their dessert omg their desserts! Not just the cakes but the squares that are on the counter, there's one it's a coconut bar..so good it has graham in it. There was one but instead of coconut it was blueberry...and Gluten free. I don't care about gluten free but it is good to know. I also got the \"Rocky Road Brownie\" so damn good."}
{"text":"This place has become one of my 'go to' spots since I moved to North Hills. Vegetarian platter is great. Falafel salad with the hot dressing is amazing.  The desserts in front are so eye catching and never disappoint.  I love that they have gift cards too.  The take out set up works great: I stop in, place my order and pay, then I run an errand at a near-by store, go get my order and head home. Love the service too!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Quick lunch service. Inexpensive. A buddy and I went there for lunch. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is good for when you really need a quick and relatively cheap meal with a Middle Eastern feel. This is a family-friendly restaurant to dine in, and take out is easy with parking in the back. The food satisfies, but there are no delicate, inspired flavors here. The pita rolls and salads contain the right ingredients but the overall quality is very average. For better, fresher falafel and the like, check out Nate's Deli or Algebra Tea House."}
{"text":"I used to freaking LOVE the Aladdin's chain but I'm starting to get a little less enthusiastic about it.. The food is good and I've always left satisfied but I do have a few issues.   What I like: Nice, big menu. Very vegetarian friendly! I think the wraps are all reasonably priced and big enough for dinner. A side salad is cheap and pretty big for the price. The service has always been good.. And I really like the decor inside. Good dessert selection, too.   What I dislike: Some of the appetizers are really expensive.. Hummus is not expensive to make so it should be cheap to order! I have also been to Lebanon and realized afterwards that this is NOT AUTHENTIC AT ALL. I ordered something with zatar, because I loved that abroad.. But it was just thyme. Zatar is a lot more than thyme. Just call it thyme if you aren't going to add anything else! It's also not the best Middle Eastern food.. There are far more authentic and delicious places around. The falafel is good but not amazing.   Ovearll, very decent and a good option for a quick dinner but you can definitely get better Middle Eastern food (and probably cheaper) somewhere else."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this food. The atmosphere is like a chain restaurant, but they serve wine and desserts that make it worth it. I like the lamb rolled, their garlic sauce, the tabbouleh and the house salad. YUM"}
{"text":"This is one of my \"fall back\" places.  The best think I like about it is it's consistency.  No matter when you go or what Aladdins you go to, you are always going to get the same delicious food.   My favorites include the the hummos, baba, stuffed grape leaves, salada, tobuli, the chicken salad pocket or salad (not your traditional mayo salad), any of the pizzas, mujadari plate, lentil soup, chili or even the len-chili..... and heck, just about everything.  You have to try the hot sauce.  It's amazing (pretty hot for those sensitive to spice).  Also the garlic sauce is yummy, extremely strong though."}
{"text":"Yum.  The chicken salad salad is sooo good.  Lentil soup is awsome, I like them both with feta cheese.  I also love to get the hummus with their hot sauce.  The hummus is a creamy consistancy and the hot sauce is super flavorful.  My boyfriend had never been there so the manager came out with a sampling of various things (If I recall correctly there was a stuffed grape leave, falaffel, tabuli and i think baba and hummus)  Nice for people that aren't familiar with the menu.  I also like the pizza's, they are on pita and have unique twist to them.  The salada is also good too.   Two things to note:  If you get any of the sandwiches (they called them rolled something or another) you may want to get a side salad or soup to go along with it.   Also, if you are not familiar with middle eastern food you may want to get some reccomendations.  My boyfriend was not too thrilled with what he ordered."}
{"text":"I stopped here on a last minute sort of thing for takeout. The time was quick 10-15 minutes. We had sfiha, not at all traditional but very good. It's a meat pie made out of a carefully folded pita, garnished with green onion and cheddar.   My friend a Kefta wrap that he liked, their Kefta is good, a cinnamon taste to it very pleasant. I had tabbouleh, very good but too watery. And they gave us these napkins, I was like so impressed lol, kinda like a thicker viva paper towel. Great quality. I usually choose to eat in bc i like the atmosphere and the wine. There cheese cakes are good too."}
{"text":"Just came from Aladdin's, the service was awful. Pita was too cold. I have been to Aladdin's in Lakewood, its far better than this branch."}
{"text":"Excellent food, varied menu, casual atmosphere.  Prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly.  My only recommendation is that they repair the paint and plaster that is falling off the ceiling.  I am worried it just might fall into the food at some point."}
{"text":"Best. Hummus. Ever. Get the hot sauce on the side. I order this as my lunch with an ice-cold Diet Coke. Nothing better. Service is always solid, hostesses friendly."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, great food.  I really enjoy the outdoor seating.  My favorite is Aladdin's Favorite Combo, because I have never been a fan of middle eastern food, but this just has great tasting food and makes you feel full even though it isn't a ton of food."}
{"text":"Good food. Great atmosphere. My fiancé and I frequent this place and never have gone wrong.   They do buckle and dime you on drinks and sauces though.... It's always kind of annoying."}
{"text":"Love Aladdin's!!  Healthy good quality food, friendly service, clean place and a fair price.  What more could you want!"}
{"text":"Good quality meats - I've had a lamb salad and a beef dish with rice.  Service was friendly and quick each time and portion sizes were healthy.  Not bad pricing either.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's! A few of us come about every other Monday after Yoga (around 9:00PM) and we have great service and healthy food options. We always start with the hummus and the veggie plate which is really good and they give a nice variety of veggies. The hummus comes with pita as a standard. Everything I have tried here is good but I generally get the Dawali appetizer (stuffed grape leaves), the dawali roll or the chicken hummus plate. All are excellent! Last night was the first time I tried their desserts; we had the cinnamon cheesecake... so so good! Definitely a good place to stop by if you are shopping around Crocker or like in our case, after a work out!"}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of Aladdin's but this is the 1st time I've gone to eat IN. It was a nice experience. I came in with about 50 minutes until close after class and was pleasantly surprised to have the best service ever! The service was fast, granted we were 1 of 3 tables in the place but still.  I had the Hummus (with hot sauce...get it- it's great!), Chicken Mishwi over Jasmine Rice with the garlic sauce, and for dessert I had a truffle (which was heavenly). Our server brought us more pita to enjoy as well as made sure our water was topped off!  Our server boxed my leftovers and gave me extra pita bread to take home! I'm excited for the leftovers tonight!  Can't wait to go back and eat IN soon"}
{"text":"Really just ok but for this type of food there's no other choice around.  Nice to go to once a month"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE! This is my every \"Tuesday\" lunch. I love the baba falafel and the beef shawarma. Excellent food and quick, fast, and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Ordered the Shish Kebab Roll with NO onions for takeout. Won't return."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about the place from damn near everyone.  In this case, the rumors proved to be true.  This place rocks.  The closest thing you will find to Zankou in Ohio.  While it's not even on the same level as Zankou, it's still pretty awesome.  This place also further proves my theory that every culture has their Heineken/Becks rip off.  Almaza for the Lebanese, Presidente for the Dominicans, etc.  Their hummus was tasty.  Their Aladdin's house salad dressing was phenomenal.  This is one of the greatest restaurants I've found around here that's for sure."}
{"text":"One of the extremely few things I miss about living in CLEvage.  It's been tough finding a place in Dallas as good as Aladdin's.  As good as Aladdin's is, it's still no Zankou Chicken though.  The closest I've found so far in Dallas is Fadi's.  Aladdin's comes highly recommended.  I took my co-worker here twice and she loved it."}
{"text":"This was a pretty bad customer service experience last night. We walk in and there are no customers waiting. There is a woman standing and talking with a server named Megan.  We wait about 4 minutes, unacknowledged by any staff.  Eventually another staff person comes up and asks Megan to seat us at one of her tables.  She does so and we place a simple order for water.  In that time I see the manager seat the other woman Megan was talking with and starts a job interview.  We wait about 5 minutes for our water which I find to be ridiculous.  It's WATER, not a cocktail!  In that time another server gets water for a table next to us and brings them their appetizer so I'm getting pretty annoyed at that point.  I place an order of hummus and get the chicken dijon rolled which is pretty much the only thing I ever have at Aladdins.  I ask if it's dark or white meat -- it's been a while since I last came to Aladdins.  She says it's only white.  That didn't seem right to me as I had a feeling I've always made the request for just white meat.  My husband orders the same thing and she goes to place the order. The manager ends her interview and I call her order and question whether it's dark or white meat.  She also says it's only white.  Fine, whatever...if the manager says so.  A few minutes later the manager comes back and apologizes and says it's all dark meat.  Seriously, get it together!  They got my request handled but had I not asked multiple times, it would have been incorrect.  Service continued to be slow and my water ran empty a couple of times yet at the end she rushed us out asking if I wanted a box before I was even done eating. Typically I love Aladdins...but the service this time was just terrible..."}
{"text":"Call me crazy but this is my favorite place in Cleveland to eat.  I first went in Columbus when I was at Ohio State, and when my boyfriend asked me to move to Cleveland, my first response was yes and my second was, OMG ALADDINS!    I have tried to recreate the rice and failed miserably.  That is my ultimate comfort food.    Love the shistawook.  The garlic sauce is strong but worth it.  Chicken is always cooked well and juicy.    I want it, now."}
{"text":"Everything everyone else said is accurate. Nice restaurant. Great and varied menu - very vegetarian friendly. Awesome sauces!"}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of Aladdin's.  What's not to like with their delicious food and great prices?  I got my usual -- chicken dijon rolled.  I love that they're willing to change to all white meat and to have them sprinkle some cheddar on top.  Yum!  My husband got the flavor savor and it was huge and delicious.  We, of course, couldn't leave without grabbing dessert.  He got the baklava cheesecake and I got the rocky road cheesecake.  He loved his but mine was \"eh\".  Had the marshmallows been melted it may have been a bit better.  Great service as always!"}
{"text":"Aladdins will never do you wrong.  The wraps are a but small so plan accordingly. But the hummus is so good you would eat it with a spoon and be completely happy."}
{"text":"Cheap and decent Mediterranean food.  It's not gourmet stuff, but if you're looking for some hummus and some decent vegetarian options, you're not likely to be disappointed.  There's a good range of stuff to choose from, and if you like one of them you're likely to like all of them; consistency is their word.  (On the down side, if you don't like one of them, well, this place is probably not for you.)    And the desserts and smoothies are very good."}
{"text":"Have now eaten Aladdin's twice, once each time I've visited friends in Pittsburgh. Very solid menu and popular with the locals, Aladdin's offers food for dine in or take out. We chose the latter. The stuffed grape leaves were tasty, and I wolfed down the Lebanese Salata. Stephen J. ordered lamb and liked it, though I think there was too much time between when the food was picked up and when we actually consumed it, as he felt there may have been a change in texture of his dish as it cooled. Our friends who go there once a month or so are most definitely fans."}
{"text":"Great meal! I don't have too many pictures as we were too busy enjoying the food. Wonderful service and food.   I am always looking for places that have great salads (hard to find) and has options for days I need vegetarian options. Aladdins is a great option for both. If you go try the hummus - with hot sauce  and veggies."}
{"text":"Very good switch from the usual pizza, mexican, chinese takeout!  Hummus amazing, the tabouli is absolutely insane, the spicy garlic sauce would be good on anything, and the yogurt sauce complements the lamb and chicken well.   I had a wrap with the lamb, pickles, and turnips. What an amazing combination.  They all compliment each other well.   My husband had the lamb platter.  The rice was a pleasant surprise and very subtle.  I will definately frequent this and the Mt Lebanon location more often.    Great unquie flavors for a variation on a takeout night!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST hummus I have ever tried and if you go it is a MUST GET. If you do get the hummus and pita, would recommend getting a side of vegetables to go with it.  Makes it even better!  Additionally if you have any dietary restrictions this is a great place to go. Lots of vegan and vegetarian options, that are actually really tasty. Most of their menu options are also really customizable, just in case you want it spicier or are gluten free. The menu is extensive and on top of that they have a huge dessert selection, including some very beautiful looking cakes. Would definitely recommend and don't forget to try the hummus!"}
{"text":"A bit salty to my taste, but not enough to lower to 4 stars, especially with excellent service, nice ambience, and still very delicious."}
{"text":"Terrific falafel and tasty veggie juices. Really appreciated this place being open until 10 pm. What an unexpected find!"}
{"text":"I LOVE ALADDIN'S. The hummus with pita, vegetables (extra pickled cucumbers), and hot sauce is my favorite. The Jasmine's Favorite Rice with Lebanese Salata is also incredible. Not to mention they always have an array of cakes to choose from if you leave room for dessert. I have never tried anything here that I did not like.   Put one in Macedonia, please!"}
{"text":"I had the tuna and falafel wrap.  Both are amazing.  If you're into seafood try the tuna.  It's char-grilled tuna steak wrapped in their pita with some kick butt sauce.  I'd skip their cakes but the food is great."}
{"text":"My mother and her gal pal both had falafel salads and mint tea. I had dolmas in a gyro, odd, yet tasty. Mmm, dolmas. I had a mango lassi, too. We all had dessert as well. Their dessert case, though not always all available, is pretty epic. I had baklava, I think my mom had a strawberry cake and I can't remember what our friend had. All of us ate for just over 30$, lots of options on the menu and affordable."}
{"text":"This place is delicious for Middle Eastern food.  I go in there at least 1x/week or 1x/ every other week (they know me by name now) haha.    It's calming and relaxing atmosphere with plenty of good food.  They have fun outdoor seating during the summer.  I always get the shishkabob salad with aladdin's dressing- so Good!!...I also get their kibbie too. Their flavor savor plate is delicious too!! In addition to getting the shishkabob salad; I get the aladdin's side of plain rice.  It's the best rice I have ever tasted.  The tarazaki chicken salad is soo good too with grapes, pears, chicken, etc with honey mustard dressing.  The best part of the experience is their dessert case (one of the best Tiramisu!!) In fact, everything I have eaten is delicious. It's a wonderful meshing of delicious exotic flavors and yummy goodness :)"}
{"text":"It was not a very memorable meal...the food was decent.  Not as flavorful as I was expecting.  Solid falafels...a bit on the dry side but pretty flavorful.  Chicken Sambusek and Sfiha were very interesting.  Pita bread wrapped with the curry chicken and ground beef in a triangle shape.  Conceptually really great, but the pita bread dries out a bit and gets hard, so it breaks or it gets mushy from the food and breaks apart.  Still, pretty tasty.  Then we got the Kafta plate.  The Kafta wasn't very flavorful...very one note and the rice mixture was also not very flavorful.  I was expecting a lot of onion and garlic flavor with a bit of spice.  Overall, ok...probably would not be my first choice when visiting."}
{"text":"Clearly this location has come under new management  this year! I used to come a lot and had an ok experience. Their food is so amazing that I had to go back and wow what a difference. The place was immaculate, the servers were quick and sweet and it was just an overall warm experience."}
{"text":"This place is the best.  Their desserts are incredible.  The food is really tasty and the prices are very reasonable.  The service is great.  This place could not improve, they do everything well."}

{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh! The staff is amazing. I've never had bad service. The food is incredible. The humus is to die for and the Kafka....yum. Definitely add this to your list!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat! The food is excellent, all fresh ingredients and healthy. There are many things to choose from on the menu. Gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options (something for everyone!). I always feel good when I eat at Aladdin's! My friends and family feel the same way too!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the one in mt. Lebanon and always enjoyed the food so I went here with dad and sister for lunch and enjoyed it just the same. Good food, for a chain. No complaints. Had the lamb wrap. Good as always. Juicy and perfectly cooked.  Had the hummus and pita for an app. Good too. Only complaints are, as always, the foil wrapped wraps are a little tacky and fast foody. I've never liked that about this place. Also, the service was a little off. The hummus app was brought out, but it was just the hummus; no pita. That did come eventually without asking but still, it's like ordering vegetable soup and bringing out the vegetables and then a few minutes later, the broth. Then the server didn't come back for a very long time to take our food order so we ate the hummus and pita with our menus in the way for while. Then after our order was taken it took a while for the food to come out. Everything else the rest of the time went fine. Maybe just an off day."}
{"text":"Always so friendly when I go in. This is the first time I have gotten food to go. It was quick! Pitza's are to die for! I got chicken!! Yum!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. My husband liked it quite a bit. My entree was bland. Serving size was smallish-medium. Prices were about $4-5 higher than they should be."}
{"text":"Prefer the Highland SQ location. Smaller but the service is better.  Orders came out wrong, service was awful, drinks were warm. Finally got meal and it was missing salad."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful- a hidden gem! Quiet place with enough customers but not too many, very good waitstaff, quickly arriving, delicious food, and reasonably priced wine. I love it here."}
{"text":"We've gone here a couple of times.  It's ever so slightly more expensive than the places we usually frequent and it's a bit out of the way from our apartment, so we don't go as often as we should.  The food is delicious (though I don't claim to be an expert on Lebanese food, just what tastes good.) and the service is great.  They've also got a couple of interesting beers that I don't normally see around here, which is a plus.    Last time, I had the beef shawarma rolled and a falafel appetizer, and she had the falafel salad.  I tried one from their beer selection and had their delicious mint tea, she just had water.  With all of that and a tip, we spent about $30.  Worth every penny."}
{"text":"It was a snowy evening and I need something warm and spicy to keep me warm!  This place was an excellent choice. I had the Mediterranean lamb along with a Lebanese beer. The lamb was cooked perfect, spiced up excellent and the right portion. The rice was a bit dry, but tasted fine with the roasted nuts. The dipping sauce provided with the meal was good as well, and so was the bread. I recommend getting their spicy sauce if you like to spice up the bread.  Overall it was a good experience, and I didn't feel like stuffed hog after dinner."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the food is very good! Service is excellent. The food is very, very healthy. I would recommend this place to anybody who likes Greek or Middle Eastern food and enjoys a wonderful atmosphere. I get the stuffed grape leaves (Dawali), hummus and hot sauce. It's tasty! You get fresh, excellent pita bread with it."}
{"text":"The rare Saturday I went to a movie meant that I could actually have time for good food at Waterworks, instead of just grabbing a wrap after a late Monday movie.   I was surprised by how large the space is. They even have a little upstairs seating area too. I was not lucky enough to go in nice weather, but there is outdoor seating. The space was simply decorated, but looked really nice. One complaint is that when we were there, it was really cold inside. I heard someone else say something to the waiter, and he mentioned that they unfortunately couldn't control the temperature. I don't think it would be like that every time, but I did wear my jacket inside.  My boyfriend and I split a small order of Baba Ganoush. The small was the perfect size for the two of us, and it was really good. My boyfriend never had it before, and he loved it. It tasted fresh and delicious. Then came our main courses. I tried the Kafta wrap and my boyfriend got a steak platter. The wrap was really good, and the meat was so flavorful and moist. It was enough for me since I had the appetizer, but I definitely would have needed a side if I had only ordered that. My boyfriend's steak was well cooked and I liked the rice that came on the platter.  I thought this place was pretty good, and the price wasn't too bad. I'd try here or one of their other locations again."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of people speculating on the authenticity of Aladdin's. I'm not that familiar with Middle Eastern food but everything I've eaten from Aladdin's has been delicious.  The service has always been great too. It's never been slow or inattentive. My only complaint is I wish they'd give you some complimentary hummus to go with that plain pita they serve every meal. I guess it's a way to get you to order hummus as a starter; you can't say no when there's pita in front of you!  Their fruit smoothie is smooth and sweet without being overbearing, the inclusion of honey is a nice touch, giving it a bit of added depth.  While I cannot comment on the authenticity of their entrees I can say that their desserts are not authentic at all. At the entrance, behind a glass display, are a variety of yummy looking cakes. I'm not one to balk at cake but I wish the display was filled with baklava, jalibeh, and a bunch of other Middle Eastern desserts to fit with the restaurant better.  Authenticity aside, I can at least say they do better than most Chinese restaurants do when it comes to representing their country's cuisine."}
{"text":"Server was very attentive.   She did a great job forecasting our needs.    Food was fresh and tasty.   Had the shawarma wrap.  Very delicious.  My son ordered a side of fresh fruit which ended up being some grapes.   He didn't seem to mind but i was surprised that there wasn't variety though it is middle of winter in the Midwest.    Will definitely come back here!   Great service and great food."}
{"text":"only had the food here once - the gyro-like thing, which wasn't impressive but wasn't bad. had dessert here twice, first time was so good i couldn't stop thinking about it so i went back and got some black/white cake and it was terrible. UGH. i hate it when places do that - you need to keep it consistent! it wasn't even just that the cake tasted bad, but it wasn't moist at all and kept fell apart as if it were old and dry. sadness."}
{"text":"Man am I bummed at myself for not coming here more often.   The first time I came here, I got the Farmer's Pitza. I'm not a vegetarian, but it just sounded so intriguing with all of the veggies packed on top with the garlic sauce and hot sauce. If you don't like spicy, this dish isn't for you. I loved the amount of heat since I love spicy food. This dish was exceptional, because they load the banana peppers on there. The garlic is pretty strong too, but it complements all the veggies. I never thought about using a pita bread as a crust for a \"pitza\" but it works! Granted, it's not as thick as a normal pizza dough crust, but it still has the right amount of crunch and doesn't have that doughy flavor. Would definitely recommend to newcomers.   If you haven't been here before, I'd also recommend the Aladdin's Favorite Combo. It has a little bit of everything and it's all delicious!! I would get this again so I don't have to choose between the beef kafta, shish kabob, or the shish tawook. Also had the baba gannouj, but it wasn't the best I've had. Nevertheless, it was still tasty and comes with an ample amount of pita bread.   The deserts are usually whatever they have available, but they have an array of flavors of both cheesecakes and cakes. I didn't realize they had these sweets so I'll definitely be coming back for more when that sweet tooth hits. They also had some interesting smoothies and lassi drinks (mango and guava) that I'm looking forward to trying in the future.   We had great customer service while here and our waitress was very receptive to helping us choose between dishes! Thanks for the patience with all our questions haha!  If you're in the area, stop by for a meal here!"}
{"text":"all the food (except for the desserts) are SO FRESH and SO DELICIOUS.  recommendations:    -any of their soups! they are all amazing    -honey dijon chicken wrap (the sauce is the best so ask for extra!)    -yogurt, nuts, fresh fruit, and honey"}
{"text":"I got the lamb plate that cost $12.95 while my friend got a pita pizza for $6.95.  She got a much bigger portion than me even if it's mostly pita and veggies.  My plate was just rice, garlic sauce, and lamb.  For $13/plate, at least load it with tons of rice.  It was decent but I didn't think it was great.    I also got their chicken chili.  It was pretty good.  Lots of beans and a decent amount of chili.  A little bit more of the soup it would have been perfect.  I do love their fresh fruit smoothies.  Their menu is a bit confusing but their fresh fruit smoothie is a blend of bunch of fruits and goes for $1.99.  It has to be the best tasting mix fruit smoothie i've tasted.  Good price too.  I also had their cookie dough cheesecake.  It was fantastic.  Would like a bit more cookie dough though.  Waitress was pretty nice.  Overall, I'd give this place another shot with another dish."}
{"text":"I think I'm pretty addicted to their hummus. Delicious food and a cool, relaxed atmosphere. Very polite and charming staff. They answer all questions about the food if you're not familiar with the Middle Eastern style. I found having a friend who knew it rather helpful too!  They have separate grills for meat and veggies, so it is perfect for vegetarians and those with food allergies alike!  Try the cheesecake. I never wanted that little pyramid to end."}
{"text":"Love, love, love their hummus and pita.  After eating it all at the restaurant I always have to get more to take home.  This time I also devoured  their cranberry walnut salad, chicken curry pitza, and the tropical storm smoothie with added kale.  I've been to the Lakewood, Independence, and Hudson locations and food and service has always been top notch.  Thumbs up all around."}
{"text":"Friendly staff who seated me quickly and gave me great service during lunch rush. Get the hummus with a side of spicy sauce if nothing else! Food is inviting and healthy."}
{"text":"Aladdin's Eatery is my new favorite restaurant! I was overjoyed when they opened a new location in Strongsville. They have a vast menu that is perfect for people who would like healthier options! They have many vegan and vegetarian meals, but also serve a wide range of meat options! The food is spiced so wonderfully and everything I have ordered has had such a rich taste. The staff is extremely friendly and the service is very quick and efficient. I truly love it here, it is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I will never be able to put into words just how much I love Aladdin's. I can easily walk to it, sit down in one of the cozy little booths in this not-to-big-not-to-small joint, mull over exactly what I want, and never be disappointed - plus, I always get my food very quickly, so whoever is in this kitchen, keep doing what you're doing!   If you're looking to get an appetizer with your meal, I highly recommend the pita and/or salads, which always have super tasty seasonings - they're super flavorful ways to start your meal off for sure. As for the main course, while there's a pretty decent number of options I'm addicted to their rolled pitas, which range from basic chicken and honey mustard dishes to Mediterranean-styled lamb or beef pitas, complete with special house sauces and dressings.  I rarely get their desserts, not from lack of quality but from lack of room - the food here is extremely filling, even if you split it with a friend like I often to. That said, I can testify from my occasional splurges that the desserts here are pretty darn good, so long as you're in the mood for cake. If not, there's both a frozen yogurt and an ice cream shop a block or two down the road. They're super easy to get to and find, assuming that you don't opt to order your dinner online in advance and then take it home, although I think this service is more there to allow someone to plan hours in advance, as opposed to suddenly deciding, Hey I want Aladdin's! At that point you may as well go to the restaurant, since they don't deliver.  Man, just writing a review about this perfectly placed restaurant with its amazing food is making me hungry...maybe I'll need to treat myself to some Aladdin's this week!"}
{"text":"I have never been let down by an Aladdin's Eatery.  This spot lived up to my expectations...great food (Hummus!, chicken curry pitza), great service, good location.  This place in Cuy. Falls had the added bonus of being bright, sparkly and new."}
{"text":"On my first trip to the west side ever, i walked into a pompus little eatery that was just too expensive for my budget, and more importantly didn't have a single veggie only dish (at the time, i wasn't eating meat). We did know our way around, and really accidently found Aladdins.   They have SO SOSOSO many dishes that have no meat in them- and are worth the money (TONS Of veggies and TOFU), and now that i am eating meat again, they have SO Many AMAZING MEAT DISHES. The Pitas rolled up with a hunk of Lamb in them, are AMAZING.   They are always VERY VERY KIND on the wallet, and the best part: ITS SO INEXPENSIVE (two people: soup, starter and meal get out for 30 bucks or less!) Its good times.   RECOMMENDATIONS: I thought i had eaten alot of Hummos in my life. I thought i had tried it all. But NOTHING EVER COMPARES TO THIS. Go to aladdins, and order the HOT SAUCE in the Hummos and PItas. its amazing. Its the most FANTASTIC THING YOUR mouth WILL EVER TASTE. Then memorize the name of the hot sauce and order ANY dish with it on it. THAT IS AMAZING.   ANOTHER: DRINK THE HOME BREWED FRESH MINT TEA. ITS perfect. No other word to describe it.   This place is healthy, clean, supportive of ALL eating decisions, and cheap. I love it a lot."}
{"text":"Love me some Aladdin's food. Lousy location, most people miss it in the Plaza with Panera, Aldi, and the movie theater. Would be great if they added a location over on Front Street by the college and a delivery service would make me order much more often.  Always great food, natural ingredients. Service can come & go....young servers often, others are stellar. Never fails to make me want to order everything on the menu. Inexpensive and definitely worth it. I suggest adding hot sauce to almost anything. The hot sauce rocks."}
{"text":"Visiting family in area. Stopped in to Aladdin's for dinner. Nice setting, friendly staff. Started w hummus and tabula and pita. Really great, not like the store hummus. Great beef shish kabob plate, beef little tough, but otherwise son enjoyed. Curry chicken roll was flavorful and large. Wife had a falafel roll which reminded her of earlier visits to other Aladdin restaurants years ago. I had a Sambusek plate, which was chicken curry in a pastry wrap and a side salad w tahini sauce. Very good. We bought 3 different baklava for take out. Great honey and nuts flavor. Great food."}
{"text":"Really wanted to try this place but was seated and no one came to greet me. After 10 minutes I left. No one even noticed."}
{"text":"After a great sprint roll this afternoon we decided to experiment for dinner. We thought it was ok here, nothing out of the ordinary. I don't know if I would go back, if I am in the area I might.   The desert was the highlight of the meal, both my daughters ordered a slice of cake which I tried and that was very good. The lamb was okay, very garlicy sauce. The rice I thought was very good.  If you want to experiment, it might be worth it. Just to expand your tastes..."}
{"text":"Very good middle-eastern food, including great vegetarian options, at a good price. Excellent salads with unique dressings. Try the vegetarian appetizer sampler."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to see menu, maybe grab a quick snack. Sunday evening, almost six. It was slow I the restaurant, a few tables, quit yet, relaxing. Beautiful dessert case, decor, and energy inside. Got hummus and falafel pita wrap with hot sauce per lovely lady's recommendation. I'm waiting for the take out and reading news articles on plaques by entrance. It was only $7 something nice for frugal savers. Although if I were ambitious I'd make my food at home. Lovely staff. Worth the wait. I'm glad I stopped, you'll be too."}
{"text":"Great service at this Aladdin's location. My favorite dish is the tabouli pocket which is fresh and flavorful, perfect with the tasty house dressing."}
{"text":"A great place for a diverse Lebanese menu with healthy options as well as vegan and vegetarian options. I've loved this place ever since going there five years ago. Great wraps, salad pockets, veggie combos, and a hot sauce worth sending to a lab to determine what's in it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times.  Nice atmosphere both inside and nice outdoor patio.  Falafel is solid, as well as good Hummus.  Prices are a good value.  Spicy Beef Kafta was tasty. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I have made it here a few times since relocating back to Cleveland.  The food here is tasty, and the price is fair.  I usually order the Beef Kafka which has a lot of flavor.  My wife likes the Flavor Savor Special.  The hummus is tasty, and the beer prices are about what you would expect ($3.5-$4.00).  All in all a solid Middle Eastern Restaurant."}
{"text":"Being a yinzer I usually don't try anything give me a hoagie and I am good go. But the wife and my 12 year old daughter wanted to try something new. So glad we did the pita pizza was excellent. They slice it into 4 slices which made an excellent starter into our new food journey. I had Alladdins favorite plate. Very good well seasoned good serving size. My wife had the lamb and judging by her empty plate it must have been good. My daughter had shanshawma (steak). Also very good. Almost all the entrees are under $14 and tons if salads and wraps to try. Overall  from one former Applebee's diner to all the others out there don't be afraid to try something new"}
{"text":"I went to this place so many times when in college.  It is a small Ohio chain.  It is Lebanese that has American tones, but is very good.  The food quality and coffee does change with location, some are a little better or worse than others, but generally the food is good.  You can spend and get a full meal, but it is reasonable, or get a wrap for less.  You can also eat appetizers and have coffee if you want a lighter meal.  This particular location is special to me as I spent so many Friday or Saturday nights there for late dinner and sometimes coffee with my classmates, many from other countries.  Its in a cozy location and the  atmosphere is a little big cityish at times which is nice."}
{"text":"This is the Westlake location.   This is a smaller local Ohio chain and if you like Mediterranean food is always a good choice.    I have eaten at this location different times.  Compared to the other locations in Cleveland (and Columbus and Toledo), this appears to be one of the the best locations, and the others are pretty good with exception of the Bagley road location in/near Middleburg Heights.    The coffee is usually fresher as well as the food.  The deaserts are enticing and normally delicious.  This location is at the  Promenade mall so it is a great place for a snack as there are many appetizers or a full meal."}
{"text":"Just got back from Aladdin's about an hour ago.  The falafel and hummus are sitting in my stomach quite merrily being digested by somewhat torpid \"me\".  Decent price point and located very close to a place I'll often be, this is definitely a good joint for a quick lunch.  My experience with the service was fine.  The waitress moved through the menu highlights with good facility and got our orders and refilled our glasses (including one milk!) with aplomb.  Food quality was decent.  Not the best I've ever had, but for a place that is well packaged -- almost \"like\" a chain, it's more than competent.  I had a very generous helping of hummus, by the way.  The pine nuts really hit the spot for me."}
{"text":"Awesome Mediterranean food Fresh food served piping hot  Great friendly waiters  Must go place"}
{"text":"Aladdin's is one of my favorite quick lunch places in Pittsburgh. There's rarely a wait for a table, the service is brisk and friendly, the prices are cheap, and the food! The food is fresh and tasty, and--if I'm reading the vibes right--pretty healthy to boot. Favorites: anything with falafel, the fattoush, and the baba ghanoush."}
{"text":"Great food great service and the best humous I've had.  I also enjoy their chicken salad"}
{"text":"I ate there once, would not go there again. The portions are small and I don't eat alot.  I feel like it's mostly bread, no real substance. The shakes are ok.  And the wait for the food was really long. The place is really small, so are the furnitures. Very uncomfortable.  Would not go there again."}
{"text":"Since I complained about the Squirrel Hill Aladdin's--specifically, the service--I thought I should review this one as well.  I used to go to this Aladdin's more frequently until Squirrel Hill became much more convenient.  However, it's worth the trip to McKnight.  The service here is always friendly and the food is brought out in a reasonable amount of time.  The hummus is amazing and I love the pitzas.  There are many vegetarian options on the menu and everything tastes fresh."}
{"text":"Despite my interest in always trying new dishes, I find myself unable to order anything besides the Chicken Dijon Rolled and Lentil Soup when I visit Aladdin's.  Inexpensive and delicious.  Wonderful choice for takeout as well."}
{"text":"Love the Chicken Mishwi Salad with tahini garlic sauce. So good! Always call in for pick up orders and it's ready super fast and always tastes on point."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite Lebanese food around. The hummus is killer and the Kibbe is a must try. My favorite is the Arayiss Rolled Pita and the tabouli with chicken!"}
{"text":"The food is great as usual, but unfortunately they don't serve alcohol on Sundays. That was disappointing! I always like to have a glass of wine with my Mediterranean meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! The owner and staff are great! You get large portion for a great price!! The service was great! I love the Quinoa salad and my vegetation chili is great! I absolutely love this resturant! Remember large portion at a great price! Yummy! The seasonings melt in your mouth! Ask for the signature hot sauce! So delicious! Bring your family for a great meal! You won't be disappointed!! The lamb and rice is so good!"}
{"text":"My family always enjoys eating here. If you like to switch things up, you certainly want to give them a try. Don't forget to try their desserts!"}
{"text":"I usually go the Aladdin's on McKnight Road, which I would give 5-stars to in a heartbeat, but I'm not as a impressed with the one in Squirrel Hill.  The food was still just as good--you MUST get the hummus and I recommend any of the pitzas--but the service is absolutely terrible every time.  The worst was when I stopped in for lunch with a friend passing through the 'Burgh for just two hours during a cross-country roadtrip, and it took an hour to be served just a plate of hummus.  The small patio was full and maybe a four tables were being used inside, but plenty of staff walked around.  Our waiter took our drink orders (water) and our appetizer order (hummus), and then my friend asked for an entree recommendation.  He suggested the lamb wrap or salad, and my friend said she'd decide when he came back.  Then: 10 minutes for  drinks (fine) and 20 more for the hummus, with a different server each time.  No one stopped to take our entree orders.  We tried flagging down one of our now three servers without luck.  Finally, the second server brought the check after an hour total.  We didn't have enough time to wait for a manager to complain.  This may have been the worse service I've received in Pittsburgh ever...the staff looks to be made entirely of young undergrads."}
{"text":"I travel for work so I'm always looking for Mediterranean places for the healthy option.  This place was the only one in the independence area so I have it a try.  Twice.  First attempt was a standard Greek salad with chicken and the hummus app.  The salad was mediocre at best, the chicken being pretty bland.  The hummus though was quite good with a nice balance of chick pea to tahini and it was well dressed.  In my travels this meal averages about 12-14 bucks, here it was about 20.  Next day I changed it up ordering the lamb salad and grape leave app.  The lamb was cooked almost to jerky status and the grape leaves overly dressed in lemon juice.  Bottom line:  misses the mark for above average pricing."}
{"text":"great customer service, usually get big orders and they are very helpful, as they bring it out to my vehicle! best hummus around!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Always fresh. The hummus is the best ever and I don't know why. Turkey wrap is fresh and grilled to perfection. So many healthy items and friendly servers. Always quick too. Only wish is that parking wasn't such a pain!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in town, I make sure to stop here.  It's a welcome respite from the meat and potatoes fare at most other restaurants.  I am in love with the salad pita, and the homemade dressings, ESPECIALLY the sesame dressing btw, are to die for!  The food is always fresh and delicious, and healthy too.  Plus you never have to wait long!  The only caveat is that the desserts look better than they actually are..but I am picky!  (Plus in the summer, you should probably just venture outside to the ice cream place nearby instead anyway..its' famous!  All in all, this is a GREAT place! YUM."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to eat, as it is so easy to find vegetarian options! If you plan on trying it out, I suggest going straight for a Hummus Rolled or Aladdin's Rolled. Simply delicious. Check out their selection of cakes and cheesecakes two, they're perfectly enormous! I highly suggest sto, definitely in my top ten list of restaurants in Mt. Lebo."}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch. Food is tasty and service is mostly good.   Went to Aladdin's in Strongsville for a lunch date. We were seated right away and our drink orders taken promptly. Their menu is pretty big so we needed a few minutes to decide. The waitress recommended the \"Flavor Saver\" which has several items on a plate. I got that and my husband ordered the lamb with rice.   They brought out pita bread with a fantastic spicy dipping sauce. I'm not a fan of spicy food but this sauce was great and wasn't too hot.   The Flavor Saver was great: several kinds of meat, rice, salad and hummus on one plate. It was delicious and very filling. The lamb with rice was underwhelming: Just lamb and rice, that's it. No salad, no bread, no hummus. The plate looked a little bare (see photos) but the food was good.   The restaurant was a little busy for lunch so the service got a little slow after our food came out. The waitresses were friendly but didn't check if we needed refills on our drinks. They asked us how the food was but we both had our mouths full so we just gave a thumbs up (honestly, how do servers always ask you how the food is when your mouth is stuffed?!)  We paid about $28 for 2 entrees and 1 tea. The restaurant is clean + tidy. The building is in a shopping plaza and there is plenty of free parking."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location over the course of the last decade. One of my favorite places to get a salad. One of the best recommendations I got was to try the flavor savor special plate. What a tremendous value. Anytime someone asks me where to eat I always say Aladdin's Crocker park!"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite Boardman Ohio eatery!  I have enjoyed a weekday lunch and Saturday night dinner and each time the service has been excellent and the food perfect.  The Mediterranean cuisine offers a variety of appetizers and entrees including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free and combinations which are all clearly indicated on the menu. Portions are generous and prices are reasonable.  Desserts are also available and take out is a frequently utilized option"}
{"text":"Some great dishes -- chicken sambusek comes to mind as a must-try dish with rich flavor. While rather dry, their kafta (meatballs, essentially) are wonderfully seasoned; the tahini dressing can help with the lack of moisture. They also have some delicious iced teas. They prepare to go orders, which can be great if you want to call in for takeout.  As a strip mall restaurant, the seating can sometimes be a bit too cozy. I'm not a huge fan of nearly being in a stranger's lap or listening to dull conversation, but what are you going to do?   While I've heard some bad service stories from friends who've eaten here, I've not had a bad experience with the waitstaff."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this restraunt last year. We were wandering, a little hungry, a little lost, and hopped in. The name sounds generic and led me to think I would be disappointed, but I was highly impressed that time and the two other times I have had the privilege to eat here.  I am a vegetarian and my dad is a carnivor. Both of us were very satisfied by our meals. I get used to having to sift through menus to find the one thing I can eat, but I can eat half the things on the menu. It's beautiful seeing all those meat free dishes.  I normally split the vegetarian appetizer sampler with my mother along with a smoothie (I prefer the tropical  storm and the fresh fruit) which I add kale to with no up-charge.  Their hummus is beautifully creamy and their falafel is crisp on the outside with a fluffy center. I am in love with stuffed grape leaves (dawali) and appreciate that their cooks are light handed with the olive oil.   This time we got their rolled pita with humus and falafel and appetizer of fatyar (sort of a spinach pastry but with pita instead of fillo).   My only complaint is that they are a bit heavy handed with their onion."}
{"text":"I recently placed a catering order for 80 half rolled pitas from this store. Their staff is very nice and accommodating! They called me the day of to confirm the order and delivered it right on time! They also gave me a $25 gift card for placing such a large order :) I tried the chicken shawarma and the beef kafta, both of which were absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place. Prices are reasonable, service is good, and they are always very friendly. The menu caters to many different diets and all the food I've had is delightful. Also, it's always a plus when a place has smoothies. ;)"}
{"text":"Aladdin's serves Lebanese food, which is kind of like Greek food (as told to us by our server). But it was actually more like Greek food's less attractive cousin. It sort of looked Greek, and sort of smelled Greek, but it did not taste Greek. We LOVE Greek food, yet we were underwhelmed by everything we tried. For example, the hummus was okay, but was overly blended to the point of having a whipped/soft serve consistency (that I found off putting), and it was too bland. The pitas served with it were really soft and floppy which made it difficult to scoop up any hummus. The \"baba\" was way too strong - we didn't eat it. The falafel was like a little ball of bland (yet strangely herb-y) mush. The pizza was okay, but like everything else we sampled, it seemed to have been seasoned with some kind of \"herb\" that I cannot place, did not like, and have never tasted in Greek food. So maybe there's a difference right there.   The place was very busy (so other people apparently like the food). It appeared very clean and the decor was nice. Our server was helpful and gracious. She thanked us several times and was very good about refilling our drinks and tending to whatever we needed.  Overall, I suppose all I can say is that we like Greek food better. It wasn't bad per se, it's just not for us. For all I know, Aladdin's could be serving outstanding Lebanese food and we just possibly don't like Lebanese food. I don't know. I'll leave that to the Lebanese food connoisseurs. But I don't see us going back. Sorry.  :("}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of middle eastern and Lebanese food and Aladdin's was excellent!  Great service and wonderful, fresh food with great portion sizes."}
{"text":"Hands down, it's always been the best Middle Eastern food in the city.  It is also a very good place to go for vegetarians, vegans, glutten free diets, or carnivores.  They have options for everyone, their food quality is super high, the selection is off the chain and the service is never bad.  They get high marks in all areas of dinning expertise.  The only thing I am not so hot on is the mediterranean pizza, but it's not awful.  I love the mujadara plate, loubie plate, falafel, hummus, grape leaves, baba gannouj, smoothies and any dessert they have ever!"}
{"text":"Went with a large group that included a number of people that needed gluten free options. Not only did they accomodate our large walk in group, but the manager immediately came to our table to discuss the gluten free choices. I had the Chicken vegetable soup and the \"Aladdin's Lamb rolled pita\". Both were excellent, and the portions were good and service was great!! I was also able to sample the \"Taza Chicken Salad', which was a very tasty combo of chicken, zuchinni, grapes and dried cranberries, topped with a Honey Dijon dressing and Feta cheese. Great combination!! Other people in our party had the Beef Kafta and raved about it. I wanted to try some of what was on the \"Aladdin's Favorite Combo\" platter, but it was quickly devoured by the children in our group! They are going to be opening in downtown Kent in the near future, so I'll be waiting...."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Being a vegan, they had such a variety of food and all kinds of healthy food to enjoy! The waitress was excellent and really made the experience wonderful!  OHH, forgot to tell you about all the delicious desserts!! Wen you first walk in, tons of cakes, etc will greet you and then they also have vegan options.  I ALWAYS go here when I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"YUMMY!  My husband and I always have great, friendly, service at Aladdin's.   The food is consistently delicious; the restaurant is very clean and the staff genuine. As a vegetarian- I am always pleased with the countless selections of delightful options!"}
{"text":"I enjoy stopping at Aladdin's when I want something light and fresh.  I recommend their salads, and the hot mint tea is refreshing on a cold day."}
{"text":"Amazing almond cake! Probably one of the best I have had. They offer a variety of cakes and cheesecakes. Parking can be tricky but the location is great. There are.tons of other restaurants around it as well as ice cream shops and a bakery. Service was good too."}
{"text":"We came here for a late lunch around 330 and I have to say our customer service was non existent. We had to wait to be seated. And then had to wait to be served. We waited so long we ordered our meal at the same time. After being served by a different person than our server, we never saw our server til we ASKED for our check. My guest and I both needed more ice tea, I guess we had to wait til we got home!!   Our food was good, I look forward to a better customer service experience next time we return."}
{"text":"Hands down best hot sauce in the world! Warning highly addictive! Never a bad meal and I've had about everything.. which is a LOT! Menu is extensive right down to the tea choices. A once a week meal for me, so many healthy guilt-free choices to eat. Service can be meh at times but I like the managers. Generally prices are fair... even when they charge for extra dressings and hot sauce it's still worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on our way across Ohio. Really nice ambience. The mint tea hit the spot. We had a bowl of the lentil soup and the \"flavor saver\" special. The soup was good, but not hot enough. The special included rice, chicken shwarma, beef kafta, hummus, a small falafel patty, and a bit of salad. The meats were both really good, and the hummus was especially nice. The desserts looked excellent but we didn't try. Extremely reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Nice dinning option at Crooker Park when you want something a bit different than the usual burger, sandwich or fried food lunch. Both vegans and those that like their proteins that walked or swam can find a lot of choices on the menu. Also a great place to stop for some beautiful looking cakes and bakery.   We started out with an order of hummus with a side of veggies and hot sauce. The hummus was good and the hot sauce added a nice zing, good heat but not scorching hot. I had a bowl of the lentil soup that was very flavorful. Nice pieces of veggies and a clean tasting broth. My wife went with the Ali Baba Pitza while I went with the Chicken Shawarma Rolled.  The Pitza looked good, nice pieces of eggplant and other vegetables, and my Chicken Rolled was well done."}
{"text":"Where can you get a meal that is great tasting, healthy, quick, and affordable? Aladdin's. We usually order to-go and it's a great way to stay healthy on those nights that you just don't feel like cooking at home."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Aladdins' food. It's great for going out to dinner or for quick takeout.   My preference is to sit on the patio - it has an outdoor courtyard feel. On our last visit, we got the baba ghanoush with pita, falafel appetizer and lamb and rice plate with tziki yogurt sauce. It was all amazing.   On the way out, there's also a delectable dessert case that always tempts me.   If this place offered delivery, it would be heaven."}
{"text":"Whenever I go there I get dissapointed! I used to go to Lakewood store all the time never had any problem!But this Crocker Park store it's very unprofessional and they always come up with excuses!they bring the wrong food you tell the waitress that's not what I ordered and they are like ohh sorry about that!but they still charge you at the end!I'm done with this store and I do not recommend to anybody!I even talked to store manager and she says so sorry come back again we will fix it!?!Why don't you fix it now?!how long will it take to get a glass of water when the half of the restaurant is empty?even for that they have an excuse!:))"}
{"text":"Great selection of fresh and tasty Mediterranean food all with quick and friendly service.  Definitely a place to visit!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I moved here not too long ago and have been here twice after seeing a movie nearby and have had a great experience both times.   I will never stop raving about their onsite homemade brewed mint tea. Add a little bit of honey, and I'm in heaven. The inside is very homey and comfortable but also classy in an elegant yellow way.  I start with hummus/pita appetizing and inevitably end up filling up on it because it's so tasty! Now, for my entree I've gotten the Flavor Savor both times for $11.95 and I feel like it's a LARGE amount of food for the price. I only eat about half and take the rest home for dinner! It has chicken and beef sausage over rice, salad, hummus, and falafel. I will also RAVE about their homemade garlic sauce! It's so delicious and definitely adds so much to the meal.  I've eaten inside the restaurant both times, but I think most people do takeout from what I can tell. I haven't gotten the chance to try their dessert because I am always so stuffed from the food. Give Aladdin's a try!"}
{"text":"A good experience at this middle-eastern food joint. Let's get the other stuff out of the way so we can get to the stuff worth talking about - the food.   The place looks like a cafe and is surprisingly well-catered for in the beverages department. The dessert selection is limited but a tour is offered, if asked for.   The staff is efficient and our guy made up for his error on the drinks by offering free pita bread to go with our complimentary hummus.   The food- we had the flavor savor platter and the taza chicken salad. The salad was to DIE for, hands down the freshest and juiciest salad I have ever had. It was so good we took one to-go with us. The platter was way better than what I've experienced from ME cuisine. The rice was not bland but complemented the kabobs well, which themselves were juicy and tender. The falafel was done right for once, with the right amount of crustiness to it.   I would definitely visit this gem of a joint again. I wouldn't be averse to experimenting with their other dishes, as what we ordered was definitely A+ grade."}
{"text":"After eating here a half dozen times I'm finally ready to comment on it. I'm a big fan of Middle Eastern food, and some of what Aladdin's offers delivers. The hummous is very good, and usually I like the falafel, sandwiches and salads. The menu here is varied and interesting, and I've had some good meals here. I ordered take out from this location yesterday and was disappointed. I picked up the veggie sampler for myself and the chicken mishwa salad for Doug. The salad had grit in the lettuce leaves, which is always an unpleasant experience. Even if this had been well prepared, it was a small serving for an entree sized salad. We get a similar salad at My Big Fat Greek Gyro, and it's twice the size, with a dozen olives in it, compared to the three in Aladdin's salad. It's like the old Woody Allen joke. Two women are dining at a restaurant and the first woman says, \"This food is terrible\", and the second woman says, \"Yes, and such small portions, too\". After a couple of bites of this, Doug ate the chicken and olives and gave up on the lettuce. The veggie sampler is too much food for me anyway, so I shared. We both found the falafel too salty, and the stuffed grape leaves were also overly salted and the rice in them a bit undercooked. The hummous was as good as ever, and I enjoyed the baba ganoush, although I like my own homemade version better. When I can make better food than a restaurant, why bother eating there? I guess the answer is convenience. I'm also not a big fan of their pita, which is very thin and dries out quickly. I called the manager and let him know how our lunch went, more to give him a heads up on the sand in the lettuce problem than anything. He offered me a credit for a comparably priced meal, which was very nice, so I'll be trying this place again, and I'll let you know how it goes! I have not tried the cakes and desserts here, as my husband is a pastry chef and we rarely order cake out , but they look beautiful."}
{"text":"First time eating here... Love the decor, we were seated immediately, employees were very welcoming, drinks and food came out in a timely manner, prices and the plate size were fair... Best of all The food was AMAZING!! We will definitely be returning again!!"}
{"text":"Baba was amazing . the bread seems pre made commercially . Shawarma chicken is good but need to ask more tahini for my liking. Good service. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love meeting friends here for lunch. The hummus is creamy and delicious, and has the perfect amount of olive oil for a smooth finish.  The stuffed wraps are delicious. I love the curry wrap as well as a stuffed falafel wrap. The falafel is always crispy and hot. It's great on a salad as well."}
{"text":"Very tasty food! Go for the Hummus with their house-made spicy sauce. Shawarma, Kababs, and Kafka are must-haves.   I was there on lunch with coworkers. They made room for us (party of 6) in the back with no wait. Service was good and fairly fast (which doesn't really match up the last time I was here). I think its a timing thing. Early lunch and noon lunch I've received very fast service -- late lunch not so much.   Anyway, Aladdin's is probably the best place around to get yummy mediterranean / middle-eastern restaurant fare. The lakewood location is exceptionally good! Crocker park also very enjoyable. But I'll leave my further kudos on their respective pages."}
{"text":"I am writing this review as an Aladdins customer for over 20 years.  The service at this location was the singular worst experience I've ever had in dining out.  To start, after we were seated (with 2 other tables seated) it took over 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us.  Then the manager took our drink order.  10 minutes after that our waitress came to take our order and the drinks came shortly after that (4 waters and 1 smoothie...nothing at all complicated!)  After this it took over 25 minutes for our food to come, which again was very simple.  All of this time waiting was even more frustrating because we have 2 small, though well behaved children.  Also during this time period nobody came to check on us, refill our water, or update us to let us know our food was taking a little long.  When our food came everything was done right and actually excellent.  The only problem we had was I asked for no dressing on my salad.  It came drenched in dressing.  When I brought this to our waitresses attention she was argumentative and told me I was wrong and this is how the salad is made.  (I literally get this salad weekly without dressing) After this happened we received absolutely zero service.  I am glad I didn't choke on anything because no employee would have seen for hours! We had had to get up from our seat for the second time (the first was when the salad came made wrong) to ask for our check and a carry out box.    The most appalling thing about this was the bad attitude our waitress displayed during our entire time here.  I've never withheld a tip before but her her behavior was  egregious that I had no other choice but to give no tip.  I will definitely eat at Aladdins again but not at this location.  Avoid this location at all costs unless you like poor service and bad attitudes."}
{"text":"Great vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, and nut free options! All appetizers have size options which is great for those dining alone or those who just want to sample. I had a falafel bubba wrap. It was plenty filling delicious and only $7!  My boyfriend had a meal of jasmine rice, Kafka, roasted chicken, hummus, and falafel on it.. I've honestly never seen him clean his plate so fast! I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have dined at the Mount Lebanon location of Aladdin's and liked it well enough, so decided to try the new location, which is a mere mile or so from my house. I went for soup and a side salad tonight, as I had a large lunch. The V-9 soup (love the name) is a thin veggie broth with lots of tomatoes and vegetables. This soup reminds me of one I once made while dieting. I believe it was an American Dietetic Association soup...you know the one. They say you can eat as much of it as you while dieting!!! Yet, you get tired of it after two bowls and never want to have it ever again. Just no real flavor, other than the veggies, which aren't even sautéed, but just cooked in the broth. Super healthy, I'm sure. Just not very good. The side salad was tasty, made with their house vinaigrette, which is an assertively lemony concoction. Usually I would find this dressing too acidic, but it goes well with the salad ingredients. Hubby had the falafel salad, which I've had at another location and liked very much. He said this one was very good. I've also had the vegetarian sampler many times at the Mt. Leb. location, and think it makes for an excellent lunch. So, most of the food is above average, and some if it's just OK. But the bread...what's with this bread? I've never encountered a pita so thin, dry and devoid of flavor. I'm not just saying this...at one point, I though I had accidentally bit off a piece of the paper napkin that the bread basket was lined with. That's how tasteless and dry this bread is. So a demerit of a star for the terrifically bad pita, which is such an integral part of a Middle Eastern meal, and for the hit and miss menu. I will return and order the things that I know are good."}
{"text":"Yelp nails it again. I travel for work and always use this app to find good restaurants. This place has what it takes to be 5star!  First, I wanted to eat quick, I was in and out in no time (which I appreciated). The waiter was very friendly. The lentil soup was amazing and I enjoyed the falafel wrap. All around, I enjoyed my experience and will be back again over the 2 week period that I'm here in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I LOVE Mediterranean Food; and am always on the hunt for the next best place. My Mom and I stumbled-across Aladdin's Eatery while out shopping and my taste buds are still celebrating. I had the Vegetarian Sampler Appetizer as my main course: no I didn't eat the whole thing, which had Tabbouleh, Hummus, BabaG(sp?), Grape Leaves and Falafel (and of course Pita).  I ate half and as my appetite slowed, I was sad to think that it was almost over: thank God for leftovers!"}
{"text":"GO FOR THE VEGETARIAN PLATTER. NOW!  I was here for a night, and as I adore Middle Eastern grub, I was happy to see this so close to my hotel. I was not disappointed... they serve some righteous food there!  My only complaint is that they would not replace the eggplant-based dish component (allergies here with the eggplant!) with anything very substantial, just more hummus. While I like hummus, a huge portion of it did not really improve the plate, but just made it more hummus-y.  Wait staff was friendly and helpful. I would go again if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"If you have read my other reviews, you know that Middle Eastern food has a special place in my heart. This place has an incredible menu with lots of non-meat options, and also clearly denotes the vegan AND vegetarian dishes. I had several small plates, and the flavors were spot-on. Their hummus was good, the grape leaves were well-flavored and had a nice texture, and the prices were reasonable for the area.  To be honest, the only thing I didn't really enjoy was the dessert. Perhaps the next time I will choose something different or go somewhere else for dessert. Other than that, this was a good choice. For those of us in the vegetarian/vegan tribe, this is a great place to eat out!"}
{"text":"Always great for a quick healthy lunch! Great salads and fantastic hummus! We get take out to the office once a week."}
{"text":"Wide variety of vegetarian and vegan options. Good food and awesome service. The ambience is kind of okay and the price is perfectly reasonable."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is an awesome chain restaurant that serves up high-quality Middle Eastern fare at relatively inexpensive prices.  The food comes out fast, is fresh, quite delicious, and will leave you extremely satisfied.  You certainly cannot go wrong with some Hummus or the Falafel Rolled.  These dishes tend to be my go to items and never fail to disappoint.  Leave room for the dessert as the selection of cakes is actually extensive and tend to all be excellent."}
{"text":"The BEST option for delicious, healthy options on the go or for. nice sit down meal. Very friendly staff. The curry, lamb roll, and vegetable soups are incredible!"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant after arriving at the Cleveland airport.  The food was delicious and the service outstanding.  My family is half Middle Eastern and it was pretty authentic.  Everything was nicely done and very clean.  The warm bread was so tasty, and our kids really liked their grilled chicken with fresh fruit.  I wish we had time to go back before our return flight home."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered takeout and they said 15 minutes. When I got there. It We a total of 35 minutes waited. Order was incorrect. This is definitely not a good experience for a restaurant that has the type of food I enjoy.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Six of us, including two children, had lunch here on a Saturday and, I must say, we all loved this place. Ambiance & service were quite good, if a bit breezy and sterile, but the food was fantastic. We shared the baba, a nice smoky eggplant dish. I had the shishkebab rolled pita and a side salad with Aladdin's dressing - both excellent. I certainly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a Saturday lunch and had a Greek chicken salad and a Lamb Roll with a baklava for dessert, together with a glass of Reisling and a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. Everything was excellent except for the salad - too much vinegar (way) and too little olive oil.   This is a great place."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with 3 friends. I ordered the chicken wrap with almonds and a smoothie, was happily surprised. The food was great so is the atmosphere... Unfortunately the server was very unfamiliar with the menu and didn't even know the difference in dressing for example. He seemed to forget us a lot even though there was only a few other costumers other then us and while I waited forever for my smoothie he kept forgetting about I watched him dance in the servers station. Great place one bad server."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday, and had a lovely time! Service was prompt, and the food was fresh, tasty, and relatively healthy! I had the chicken shawarma roll with a side salad, and we shared the hummus plate among our table. The hummus is delicious, as was he roll! The surprise star for me, however; was my side salad! The dressing was light with the right amount of tang, the cheese on top was a nice touch of salt, and all of the veggies were fresh and crisp. We ended up finishing the meal with a slice cake- it was a chocolate lovers something or other brownie cake- which was awesome! It was nice and chewy and topped with a cake pop ball. Overall, it was a nice refreshing meal, and I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Chicken hummus dinner was fantastic. Get the hot sauce.  Decent wine selection.  FYI...do not order carry out from here Monday-Friday around 5pm.  Rush hour is ridiculous in this area."}
{"text":"We ordered a lunch for 10 people on June 15th, 2017.  Everyone got a wrap and a side of tabouli or hummus.  (Side note, if you order the day before or early enough in the morning they DO deliver.)  Initially when we got the order we did not have any pita for the sides and one of the tabouli was missing chicken.  When I called I was told that there should have been a large bag full of pita, but upon double checking the pita was in fact forgotten.  Since we only had an hour and was a business lunch we requested they deliver the missing items.  Raphael delivered personally the missing food and even included a bonus to-go container with some sweet treats!  It was an great gesture that surely forgave the initial disappointment.    I ordered the beef croquettes, they were nice and crispy on the outside and came with some delicious toppings of onion, tomato and yogurt.  I wish I ordered a side of hot sauce to bump it up a notch though.  The desserts were awesome!  Not too sweet which I loved.  I always avoided the desserts because of this concern but I think I'm the future I will indulge!"}
{"text":"Based on many of the reviews I was expecting the food to be amazing.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything that will make me want to go back.  The hummus and baba ghanoush were very good but the entrees were just fair."}
{"text":"First time in today for lunch. Wow what a wonderful place. Our server was gracious and catered to our needs. The menu is extensive and has a lot of options for a wide variety of eaters. They have meals for vegetarians, vegans, gluten free and meat lovers. They also have a nice selection of desserts to satisfy your sweet tooth. Overall great fresh Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"ALWAYS a favorite of my family. Everything we order is always very good. The staff are knowledgeable and friendly. The manager of the restaurant is fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I love coming here. Make sure you get hot sauce with your hummus! The hummus falafel rolled is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I really like have an Aladdin's in the Waterwork Mall.  Aladdin's just so happens to be one of my favorite restaurants. The food is always delicious and the wait staff always great to interact with.    This was my first visit to the Waterwork's Mall location and just like with the locations in Squirlle Hill and Mcknight Road it was terrifc. I wanted for nothing."}
{"text":"Get the fattoush with chicken!!!   I have now been to this eatery a total of 4 times and I have enjoyed each and every visit.    My only complaint is that the safhi that I had ordered as an appetizer the meat was a little dry. It still tasted wonderful but the meat seemed like it was reheated....  Great trendy atmosphere and heala good food yumm-o  The vegetable salata at Aladdin's is to die for."}
{"text":"The Chicken Curry Pitza is my favorite lunch choice. We used the free Yelp coupon for hummus appetizer. It was a large portion, enough for 2, and very tasty. it was Stehen's, our waiter's, first day and it was busy. He did a good job keeping up with a full house."}
{"text":"So, I have been a loyal patron of this establishment for years. I have always had favorable experiences, hence the continued patronage. However, today I regret to say I was less than pleased. First off, the hummus which is bar none, the best anywhere, was awful. There was no flavor and the consistency was thin and seemed \"whipped\". In addition, the Regular size portion has dramatically decreased in size. Like, by half. Same price though. Very disappointing. In addition, I asked my server for sweetener for my iced tea not once but twice to which I was told, of course and, received nothing. Yes, it was busy but it's always busy. It seems lately, that the staff changes continually. Seems like something has changed recently which has caused things to go down hill. I will try again,  but must say I'm truly disappointed in today's visit."}
{"text":"Have to give this 2 stars because the service was so disappointing. We opted to sit outside, and our waitress only came by a few times. Once our food was delivered, we immediately asked for pita to go with the hummus we'd ordered. 10 minutes later, we had to walk inside to get it so we could finish our food. Unfortunately, we had to wait again after our meal for the waitress to return to fill our water glasses and give us the check. The food was very tasty, but at $75 for 4 of us, it's just not worth not-so-great service."}
{"text":"Everything if fresh and good. A regular in my rotation. They can accommodate special orders too.   Veggies love it here."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a favorite haunt of mine for lunch, or to pick up something delicious on my way from work to whatever my evening plans are. The food is delicious and freshly made, and straightforward enough that even the pickiest/most cautious eaters will feel comfortable ordering here. I've never tried their vegetarian options, but I'm told they're great as well. My personal favorite menu items are the tabouli and the shish kabob rolled pita or platter. They also make really good hummus (and I don't actually like hummus, but I will gladly eat this). They also have a really pretty dessert display with all kinds of cakes and other goodies, and the tiramisu is particularly amazing. Literally the only complaint that I have is that the locations are all small, so if you want to bring a group seating can sometimes be tough. All in all, I HIGHLY recommend Aladdin's to anyone with taste buds."}
{"text":"Aladdin's was quiet around 8 PM on a Thursday night but I had my pick of tables and the service was awesome. The len chili was awesome and the mujadara plate was tasty, as well as huge. Most of it came home with me for lunch tomorrow :)  Awesome options for vegans and vegetarians!"}
{"text":"My sister lives in this neighborhood with her fiance and we were looking for a place to go get dinner. I go to school out of state so I dont get to see them often. My sister suggested going here and I was like \"Sure.\" I've never had Mediterranean food before and I didn't know what anything was. I ordered something random off the menu and it ended up being pretty good! It was like a chicken beef thing with rice and whatnot but it was good. After that I got an oreo cheesecake for dessert and it was mad decent."}
{"text":"I have been several times to Aladdin's and I have never been disappointed.  The service is fast and professional while the food is delicious and always fresh.  My absolute favorite is the tabouleh salad while their rolls are also great, with a preference on the beef kafta roll.  The venue is also big so there is rarely any waiting associated. I am pretty sure there are many more times to experience the food there for me :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch at Aladdin's. Their menu is expansive - it took me forever to choose what I wanted, and I think that I'd have been happy with any number of things.  The food is reasonably priced and pretty tasty. I want to go back sometime and try some of the cheesecake that they proudly display, too!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and fantastic. A lot of vegetarian options. Service is great. Always a nice place to grab lunch."}
{"text":"I liked Aladdin's the moment I walked in the door.  The Fattoush is superb it's so good that I have even taken to making it at home. For those occasions when I can't make the trip to Northhills.  If there were an Aladdin's in my neighborhood I would eat here as often as I could.  I am taking one star off because once I ordered tuna and it was dry and over cooked.  I like to start every meal with Sfiha. That I have not made at home because I don't know how to season the meat.  It's a real treat and topped with cheese in green onion inside the bread is a mixture of ground beef, spices and scallions.    The cheese cake selection is off the chain!!! You'd be surprised how big a cheese cake can be made!!!   Aladdin's is good in the dead of winter, or on warm spring day."}
{"text":"Delicious baba ganoush and falafel - the fresh juices and desserts are also yummy. My fave is Jafari's pitza. I've dined at various Aladdin's locations about a dozen times and have always had a good experience and great food."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of Aladdin's in Akron. The new Fairlawn location looks great but the food and service is lacking. Hummus is watery and the hot sauce is oily. Get it together guys!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been tasty and reasonably priced. I can recommend the salads, stuffed pitas, falafel, and pita pitzas. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Very consistent. This place has some great Greek food and their hummus is very fresh. Best tabouli I have had in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Aladdin's Eatery chain and this location in particular. The staff is always professional and friendly, and the space is quite nice. I've eaten there over ten times now, so I feel confident whenever I recommend this place to a friend or bring someone new there.   My favorite items are the lentil soup topped with chicken and the Vegetarian Sampler. The soup makes a light but complete meal, and it's very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. On the larger side, the Vegetarian Sampler is composed of several of their vegan appetizer dips, stuffed grape leaves, four pieces of falafel, and several pieces of pita bread on the side. It takes me back to being in the Middle East every time I eat it! All of the rolled pitas (Aladdin's version of a wrap) are a sure bet as well. Each one I've had is delicious. Besides the food, there is a decent beer selection and a wonderful juice and smoothie menu. It's the perfect accompaniment to your meal. With food and service this great I know I'll continue eating at Aladdin's as long as I'm living in Pittsburgh. I'm happy it's an institution here!"}
{"text":"This was the best meal I have eaten in Ohio (I have visited Ohio over 30 times).  The only thing that was sort of \"meh\" was the coconut cake."}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular food and service. I would strongly recommend it!!  We normally do take out however today we decided to dine in.  I got Flavor Savor Special Chicken Mishwi and Beef Kafta \" my favorite \" on a bed of seasoned brown rice with vermicelli, served with greens, Hummus and Falafel AMAZING!! My friend ordered the 3 app special for $10 what a value!! Jonathan provided excellent service and Noor was FANTASTIC and attentive!! Looking forward going back real soon.  Keep up the great work!   Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!! When they're busy the service can be a little slow at times."}
{"text":"This is a local chain that serves up some really excellent Middle Eastern food. They don't serve my favorite, Sleek, but they do have great soups, salads, wraps and desserts.  The service is excellent and I always feel welcomed and comfortable here.  There's lots of vegetarian options to choose from, for example, they have a vegetarian combo in the appetizer section that is amazing.  I also love the smoothies, teas, and other drinks."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in several years, but if Aladdin's is anything like I remember, it is a great place for dinner in Cleveland.  The food was tasty and the place has a great atmosphere.  Good for casual dinner, and I recall them having great desserts!"}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's!  I go here at least a couple of times a month for lunch.  It is a perfect lunch spot, but for dinner I would choose to go elsewhere or do takeout.  The food is always very good.  My favorite is the Flavor Savor Special.  Their salads are also very good."}
{"text":"Carla and I have eaten here several times, and we're always pleased. Their falafel wrap is wonderful - a definite must have. When then weather was cold, their warm lentil soup was also a great treat. Aladdin's is definitely our go-to place for Mediterranean food in the 'Burgh. Order online and pick some up on your way home, too, since the food also travels well."}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and the flavors are excellent. The service is always very nice, although the prices are slightly too high for the simplicity of some of the food. The hummus is delicious, the salads are excellent, the wraps are great, etc. I haven't had anything here that I didn't enjoy, and also recommend the cakes. Altogether, great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Lunch for me is always in the off hours.   The good thing is that I miss the crowds.   Having said that,  I get a real good feel for service.  In the off hours,  wait staff are fulfilling their other duties; cleaning,  filling supplies, catching up with co- workers,  etc.  Which brings me to my one star review.....  I witnessed my waitress cleaning up the back area near the smoothie station.   She rolled up the black floor rug with her bare hands and swept the floor.  Then,  she unrolled the rug (did not wash her hands) and came over and asked if I needed anything else.   Ugh.. no thanks.   Afterwards,  she handled smoothie orders,  too.   So all you five star raters continue to enjoy the good food they serve.   I'm done."}
{"text":"Great food, clean and relaxing atmosphere. Decent service."}
{"text":"The food is healthy, fresh, and made with care. You can find gluten free, vegan, vegetarian and meat options that you will feel good about after eating. The warm falafel hummus roll with hot sauce on the side is my favorite. Some other good options are the Greek salad, tuna roll, hummus plate, carrot cake, and Oreo cake. The food is really really good."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy Middle Eastern food.  I've always experienced attentive service here and everything tastes as if it is made fresh.  They serve great smoothies that feature fresh fruit flavor without being too sweet.   The dessert case displays the daily offerings, not listed on the menu because they change frequently.   The reasonable prices, vegetarian options and fresh ingredients keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Back in April (2014) I called for take-out order of the Hummus Shawarma Plate just before closing time. The service was quick, my order was ready faster than expected, and the food was great. It was a perfect midnight snack. I'd definitely go back if I'm ever in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Great service, and many gluten free menu options. Smoothies and the honeymooner fresh juice is great. Love the baba with veggie platter:)"}
{"text":"The Lamb Salad with Alladin's house dressing is the best salad I've ever had."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was delicious  Everything was great including the service. We'll definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I never thought I would like Middle Eastern cuisine, but after lunch at Aladdin's, I'm a changed woman!  This location isn't far from my office, and Aladdin's is perfect for a light, inexpensive lunch.  On my first visit here, I got the Aladdin's Favorite combo.  This comes with lettuce, tomatoes, vermicelli/rice, Beef Kafta, Shish Kabob, and Chicken Tawook.  I believe the price was around $13-14, but it was well worth it.  The portions are decently sized and just enough to satiate my lunch cravings.  I went again today and my coworker and I split an order of the grape leaves to start. Oh. My. Goodness.  I had tried grape leaves at a potluck once and HATED them. I swore I would never eat them again... until today.  Aladdin's serves theirs warm with a side of pita and topped with olive oil and feta cheese.  They were so good that I honestly considered ordering another plate as my entree!   I was craving lamb though, and ordered the Aladdin's Lamb Rolled for lunch.  It was the perfect size and only $8!  It was filled with lamb, veggies and Tahini dressing. Yum, yum, yum.  Service is quick (I think we waited maybe 10 minutes tops each time for our food), prices are great, and the flavors are amazing.  One recommendation I definitely have to make is to try the zesty sweet tomato dressing OR cilantro vinaigrette when ordering a salad. I tried both when I had the Favorite Combo and kept alternating dipping my fork in them before each bite!"}
{"text":"A go-to place for my group of friends' girls nights. Cozy atmosphere and never overly crowded. There is something for everyone here, including vegan, gluten free and vegetarian options. I have never had poor service here and their food is INCREDIBLE. Hummus and hot sauce, Falafel Salad with feta cheese and tahini dressing, pomegranate iced green tea, and Hummus Falafel Rolled are some favorites! The falafel in general here and that pomegranate green tea is not to be missed! Their homemade hummus is the most creamy and best I have EVER had. I also like this place because it is not overly expensive and is a healthy dinner-out option! Don't miss this little gem hidden in a shopping plaza!"}
{"text":"We had a very friendly waitress when we came in. The wrap I had here on my first visit was dry, though. They give you lots of pita bread as opposed to rolls before they bring out your order, and it came out hot. They also clearly label vegan options on their menu including sauces. For those ordering take out, the tahini dressing is not vegan."}
{"text":"Wow!  I waited to eat here until my fiance' was available and it DID NOT disappoint us!  We came in on a beautiful Sunday evening (the patio was popular but we prefer inside dining).  The hostess seated us in a quiet corner and the ambience was lovely!  We had a great chance to \"people watch\" from the windowed wall along the patio.   Our waitress, Cassandra was excellent!  Very attentive without smothering us.  We each ordered beer (unique selection) and appetizers.  We ate every bit of our food!  Babaganoush, the Veggie platter, Kibbie, Grape Leaves, extra pita and Tabouli.  We heeded other reviews and accepted the offer of hot sauce (and dipped it in the Babbaganoush).    We watched a family touch the beautiful curtain dividing the main dining room from the ante room we were in.  It is a filmy curtain that has a decoration of pressed leaves, beans and plant stalks embedded in it.    As reviewed, the menu is expansive and the titles are listed in a language other than English - so you have to READ the descriptions in order to see what it is that you are ordering.  We loved it and ate everything!  We will be back and hope to enjoy the Lebanese Wine Selections on the menu in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The hummus and fattoush salad are my absolute favorites."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped at Aladdin's after an evening of shopping at the Giant Eagle Market District on a recent Saturday night.  We got rockstar parking right up front and proceeded to have an EXCELLENT dinner!  Our server Jillian was so great!  She seated us, got our drinks, and gave us ample time to peruse the large and varied menu.  I had a glass of red wine and Ray had a Dortmunder Gold.  I should mention here that I was impressed with the wine list... it had several wines that I have never heard of.  The prices per glass were on the high side (nothing below $7) however well worth the cost.  I'm a stickler for ambience and this place has it!  Although it was brightly lit and a bit cold (tile floors, wood and stainless steel), the colors provided warmth and the booths were comfortable.  All in all it was pretty darn romantic.  We ordered a sampler plate from the appetizer menu that included Baba Ganouj, Hummus, grape leaves, tabouleh, pita bread, cucumber/onion/tomato salad,kibbees, and some delicious vegetarian meat pie things that I've never had.  We also ordered extra grape leaves, hot sauce and a Pitza (thanks for the recommendation fellow-yelpers!)  We LOVE pine nuts; we LOVE tabouli; we LOVE fresh, chewy pita - we were in heaven here!  I asked for the dessert menu and was informed that I could go on a dessert \"tour\".  A tour of desserts???  That's for me!  Jillian introduced me to every beautiful, decadent, lovely masterpiece on display in their showcase.  I was happy to note that although the selection had many chocolate offerings (I like chocolate but, ho-hum), they had several yummy non-chocolate cheesecakes.  We carted home a large piece of Peach Cassata cake.    The location along Portage Trail is great for people-watching and the streetscape is beautiful.  We can't wait to. come back!"}
{"text":"I have never written a review before but I'm compelled to write one today. I was on my way to work and I wanted to get a take out meal to have later while at work. I ordered online at the Aladdin's in Crocker Park. When I got there the young woman said that she never received an online order but it would only take 12 min if I wanted to wait. I placed my order and after 1/2 hr passed I went to the front desk and asked if my order was ready. The young man said that they had no such order. He gave me my money back and as I was leaving he said \" sorry about that \". I left the store without any food. I will never patronize that store again. I have always received great service from the Lakewood and Middleburg Hts Aladdin's. In the future, I will drive a little extra distance to to patronize these stores My e mail address is Linoh53@aol.com"}
{"text":"I am a bit addicted to Aladdin's.  For a long time i couldn't bring myself to get anything other than the greek chicken salad.  One day I tried the Fatoosh and I don't think I'll ever be able to get anything else.  It's delicious.  I love the seasoning on the chicken, their hot sauce, and garlic sauce.  They have a large menu so there really is something for everyone."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful and staff were great.  The food was a disappointment, small servings for a high price mediocre taste. Visually the food was unpleasant looking. It was ok but expected a bit more for the money."}
{"text":"Bland food.  Bad desserts.  Slowish service. Great location."}
{"text":"There are few select items that I truly love but don't dare order after seeing the nutritional info. They want you to believe this place is healthy, although it is anything but!!! Don't believe me? Look up the nutritional menu on their website! Aladdin's is a wolf in sheep's clothing..... but I do love their smoothies."}
{"text":"I've been an Aladdin's fan for years.  All of their locations are fantastic.  For seating, I guess I would prefer the Mt Lebo location, but Squirrel Hill has a lot more space.   I got the baba falafel rolled with a side salad.  The side salad was much larger than I remember and had the cucumber-tomato salad on it as well with feta.  It was a very good salad for very little money ($2.25).  The pita was perfect with crunchy pickled vegetables and crispy falafel balls.  The baba is nicely smoky.    The only thing that caused the 4 instead of 5 stars was the rasberry sunshine smoothie.  It was lacking a bit in taste which is surprising when it was definitely full of flavorful items."}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered take out. I had the lamb rolled pita and was expecting the lamb be a little bit more juicy and flavorful and the sauce a little more too. Since the roll over all felt dry and not big on flavour:/. My friends had the curried chicken roll and that was mind blowing in taste, texture and everything that makes a good pita. I definitely recommend that above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Went again to Aladdins. Great food but the server must have been new. He was sweating bullets and forgetting everything we asked for. He was very nice and we felt bad but most of our orders got screwed up."}
{"text":"So ordered a large take out order over $100.  Cashier asked if we wanted hot sauce.  Sure...cashier says \"it will be 65 cents\". really!  btw asked for hot sauce when placing the order so we paid for it, but she did not know if they put it in the bag... instead of just giving it to us, she wanted to charge us.  After conveying my displeasure, she says \"fine don't get mad, you can just have it\".   I am confused--penny wise.  Food is ok, but frankly i think it is overpriced."}
{"text":"They have a small amount of outside seating which is nice for people watching. I ordered the Aladdin falafel rolled for dinner which was delicious and vegetarian. Also had the berry smoothie and it was good. I did have to wait a bit for someone to take my order, maybe between 5-10 minutes, but they apologized and when the check came they had comped the smoothie. Overall very happy, even went back the next day for lunch."}
{"text":"Just went back  It's still amazing  I loved their spicy kafta roll  So healthy, different, cheap, quick, awesome....  I'm a big fan.  I wish they had one of these in Phx :("}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It's not been easy moving to Western PA from the Bay Area, and I'd really hoped this would function as one way to get Middle Eastern food in the area. We've been twice, and have come away disappointed both times.   Positives: god service, clean, some meats are well cooked, the hummus is great, and freshly squeezed orange juice that is what it says it is.   Negatives:  1. For starters, I just don't understand how they can serve this really dry, generic pita without anything: no olive oil, yogurt, hummus, nothing. I've never encountered this in any Middle Eastern context. How can they do this?   2. Their salads are bad. Both times I've been served sub-par salad greens: wilting, dry, stale.  3. The lamb plate was a disappointment: too dry. I got a combo plate today, and the meat was very inconsistent: some medium rare, others well done. My husband's hummus shawarma plate had very well done meat. 4. Finally, I have a very bad aftertaste from the food today: something very canny and unpleasant. I think it may have been the meat or the vermicelli. Either way, we will not be going back. Which is just too bad."}
{"text":"I've traveled all over the Middle East and have acquired an affinity for the food of the region and I was pleasantly surprised to find this restaurant on a recent business trip to Ohio. The food here is authentic, delicious and reasonably priced. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent healthy meal."}
{"text":"Holy freaking cow. This place was awesome. Came in later (2030 ish) on a Wednesday night. We had never been before, so asked to check out the menu- we were greeted immediately. Checking out the menu, tons of \"vgn\" options to choose from (animal product free). Prices are very cheap, especially for the area, so I assumed small portions (wrong). Our server was Kaitlyn. She was prompt, nice, and knowledgeable about the menu. She was friendly, but not overly, and really helped have a great experience with her expertise. Assuming those small portions, we went with a regular hummus- a rather large size for just two. Extra pitas were brought, and some fresh extra ones for what was taken home with us. We didn't know about the hot sauce, so she brought us one to try. Legendary. I used way too much the first time, and it was spicy- but by time I realized how spicy it was, the heat dissipated. It was very flavorful, and not too strong or over the top. For my meal, I went with the Baba Roll with black olives. The olives were clutch- the wrap was great (crispy and warm without being too crunchy or over done, and insides were just right), but the flavor was very flat. To be clear, not bland but a bit plain. My \"vegan\" eating companion wasn't vegan today (don't get me started...) but they enjoyed their carni wrap. For two of us, stuffed to the gills with delicious food, we would have been out under 20 if someone didn't get a drink.... At one point the manager stopped by to check on service, and we commended her for the food and service. She informed us about their business a bit- fresh made daily, local ingredients. I couldn't be happier with the service or the food. Great work!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I recommend their baba ganoush, tiramisu, and their chicken shawarma wrap!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and have to say the service is quick and pretty good. I find it a bit weird that the gyros you order come wrapped in aluminum foil although it is a sit-down restaurant, but regardless the food is very tasty."}
{"text":"Went here to pick up lunch for takeout during work. The food was prepared quickly and I thought the menu was a great value for the portion sizes I saw being served. I had the flavor savor special, which I thought had great variety with both the chicken mishwi and beef kafta, was fresh, and tasted absolutely delicious. I was going to give this place five stars and couldn't wait to come back...until later that week a colleague of mine went there for lunch and consumed part of a green stinkbug with his salad. Now, I'm not easily perturbed by insects and I can forgive a lot of places for small things entering my food now and then, that's to be expected. But I do feel that there is some major gap in food preparation in the kitchen to let a bug the size of which he described slip by into someone's meal. I was told they handled the situation very generously, but I certainly hope the other locations are more careful. I would have changed my rating to two or one stars after that story but I feel unfair in doing so since the bad experience did not happen to me and is hopefully just an isolated incident."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch yesterday. Food was fresh and healthy.  We tried a new cauliflower side dish which was very good. I recommend to get hot and or garlic sauce  with your hummus or baba ganoush.  Hostess was not friendly at all. Service could be better."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Aladdin's since it opened years ago. The same can be said now as then. The Aladdin's in Cleveland Heights on Cedar near Fairmount is outstanding in every way. The food and service and ambiance are all A+ or better. But the other locations including Bainbridge, Mayfield Village, and Independence are C rated at best. Food and service is passable but barely. The same dishes for example the Shawarma pita roll and toubulee appetizer while perfect in Cleveland Heights is served sloppy wet (roll) and buried in vinegar (salad). And the help's inability to serve what is ordered. Management needs to take note!"}
{"text":"This place has some really great food!  I was introduced to Aladdin by a Lebanese friend...so I knew he knew this place was good. I was very impressed. They have some really great veggie dishes and superb wine (note: check out the Chateau Ksara red for good value). Oh, and don't miss the baklava!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great tasting and healthy food at a very reasonable price, with quick service."}
{"text":"this place is pretty good! i enjoyed their salads, hummus, and chicken shwarmas. i've been here a few times now and it's always been good!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a middle eastern fix but nothing to write home about. I like the chicken-len (chicken lentil soup). Salads are nice (fresh and of good size). Good for a veggie fix. No major complaints here. I would say it's worth trying Aladdin's but it's not like the genie is out of the bottle or anything (read as - off the hook)."}
{"text":"Visited on a snowy Saturday for lunch.  The place was not crowded so we were seated eight away.  The waiter was plesant and patient with the fact we needed to wait for 2 more to show.  All the food was good except for a chili soup my spouse ordered.  The Hummus is very good.  4 of us split a medium Hummus appetizer.  The atmosphere was relaxed and the price was good for lunch, $50 for 4 , ordered water.  It's a good place to take a break or warm up."}
{"text":"Aladdins is pretty damn good considering it's a chain!  The Mediterranean delicacy is fantastic!  I absolutely love the lamb plate!  And the hummus with their hot sauce is awesome!  If I have to endure the spicy food twice (you know what I mean), I would prefer it to be tasty!  And their hot sauce is super tasty, which is well worth the red-eye burn!!    I very much enjoy this little gem as does the whole family!"}
{"text":"I really love Aladdin's!  PROS:  GREAT food great prices a large variety very clean outdoor dining (weather permitting) nice area/neighborhood authentic mediterannean food. Nice servers. an AMAZING dessert case with the most decadent and fresh cakes!  CONS:  street parking only (and its hard to find any)  LADIES ROOM:  Very Clean!   Must Try: Hummus Sfiha Mediteranian Lamb Plate (Lamb with their special rice which is delish!) ANY of their cakes!  You should see this dessert case, truuuust me! LOL"}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean food. I come here and get the hummus every single time. The majudra (I think that's how you spell it) is a very interesting, but delicious meal. The tuna steak salad with the cilantro dressing is also incredible.   Overall, there aren't many options for Mediterranean food in this sea of chain restaurants that is Mentor, Oh. And while I am aware that Aladdins is a chain, it is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"I am not sure how I missed Aladdin's searching for places to eat as my mom and I make a yearly day-trip to this part of Cleveland, but I am glad to find it this year. My mom (a vegetarian) and I love middle eastern/Mediterranean food and where she lives, there is not a lot.   We stopped in as soon as we got into town and were the first patrons for the day. Service was a little slow to start, but the rest of the time was better. The restaurant is well appointed and comfortable and there was quite a crowd once it got closer to noon. Very large menu with a considerable amount of vegetarian items (also notated what is vegan and gluten free).   We both had the brewed black iced tea and it was very tasty. It was a cool day, so my mom started with the Lentil soup which had swiss chard, potatoes, and other veggies. She was impressed by the size of the bowl and the taste (as was I when I sampled). Not salty and very fresh. She devoured it. I ordered a side salad with my main course and it was a large pile of a fresh variety of greens, tomatoes, onions, with cheese and dressing. It was almost too much for the salad plate it was on. I could have used some more of the house Aladdin's dressing too or would have probably asked for it on the side to spread more evenly the next time. It wasn't anything fancy, more of an oil and vinegar mix.  My mom got the Falafel Salad which was a large plate of similar greens and 4 very large falafels. They were very tasty and well seasoned.  Not greasy or over-fried. She does not normally like straight Tahini, but went with the Tahini yogurt dressing that was provided and she liked it, but said it wasn't enough by the time she got towards the end of her meal for all the falafel and the salad.  I got the Shish Kabob rolled pita. It was sort of strange to see it rolled in a metallic wrapper like street food while my mom's food and other diners were more 'formal', but not a huge deal. It was warmed up well which was nice and the pita wrap was tasty. The beef inside was perfectly cooked and melted in in my mouth. I would have like a little more meat, but what was there was great. It was tasty and good for the price.  We would definitely come back and try again. Happy with the meal for the price and atmosphere. Please come to Jamestown, NY and make my mom happy. :)"}
{"text":"I tried one of their pita pizzas over the weekend it was pretty good. I also ordered a side of rice and I like how their rice is like a pilaf. Very good. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here; food is excellent, service is great and the prices are very fair. The tea is absolutely amazing and should be tried by everyone who visits. The atmosphere  makes it all complete and this is definitely one my favorite places to eat in all of Ohio.  Also, this is where my girlfriend and I had our first date. Thanks for making that an awesome experience as well. :)"}
{"text":"Had it for lunch, had the lamb special pita and hummus. Food was delicious with pomegranate green tea. Server was always looking out for the customers and was kind enough to explain if we had any questions. I'll be coming back next time in town."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! !  We have been eating here for 3 years and have never had a bad meal.  Many different types of meals, vegetarian and meat dishes.  We just were there 3 days ago, 1 soft drink, appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert plus tip equalled $32.  A great value and when it's my choice I don't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Nice family atmosphere + reasonable price + variety of flavors. Found their portion size to be quite small though. Nice place to go if you like Mediterranean cuisines at good price. Personally I'm not a fan though."}
{"text":"This is a great chain spot in the north hills where the options for vegetarian food are not great. They have great falafel salads and dishes. I love their homemade hummus, grapeleaves and other Greek staples. They even offer smoothies and other health conscious options. No complaints, solid for a chain."}
{"text":"Very very good and fresh food . You can't go wrong here ! I had the most fresh salad from here and enjoyed every bite. Will defiantly be ordering often. I complimented the cashier that the place was really nice interior design wise and she asked if it was my first time eating here and I replied yes and she handed me a assortment of baclava which was very very good! WONDERFUL customer service. New favorite salad stop can't wait to try some other menu items!!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Mediterranean/middle eastern food all over the US. I was very impressed by Aladdin's at the waterworks. The flavor savor plate(which is a ridiculous name) is a great variety of what they have to offer, pay the extra to get the hot sauce and tahini sauce and you will be very satisfied. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good and HEALTHY food. Great smoothies and desert. Friendly service. Great location as well. It can get loud, but the second floor is a more quiet refuge appropriate even for an informal meeting or group outing."}
{"text":"Update 8/10/17  So, I tried again with the gift certificate I was given and decided I could update my review and add one additional star. My experience wasn't significantly different than the last visit.   The positives? We were greeted with friendly smiles and seated on the patio immediately. Our food was very very good and came out right the first time. Our server greeted us immediately and was very pleasant.   The negatives? We weren't given silverware or napkins again....had to ask once the appetizers were delivered. Our server was absent most of the service and it became frustrating. She was pleasant and attentive WHEN we saw her, but that wasn't very often. Vegetable plate portion was still SIGNIFICANTLY smaller than it should be for $5.  Sadly, we will not come back to Aladdins to eat. Hopefully they fix their patio service.... $67 later and had I paid out of pocket for the meal, I would have been angry.  ------------  Update 5/20/17:  I was contacted by management in regards to my poor experience less than 24 hours after it occurred. Gaelle and Lael were sincerely apologetic and took full responsibility for what happened. They offered me a gift card and encouraged me to give them another chance to make things right. Once I have gone back, I will be updating this again....hopefully to a much more favorable star level. I applaud management for their customer service. It is such a breath of fresh air!   -------------  I must say, I am horribly disappointed with the experience I had at this location. I am a huge fan of Aladdin's food. So, I was very sad when this experience was so poor....  They weren't busy when we arrived. Less than 25% of the restaurant was occupied and there was plenty of staff. It made me smile because I figured we would get sat right away and get in and out with a full tummy! But alas, I was wrong. It took them 5 minutes to acknowledge our existence....I was shocked quite honestly. Considering the front door and register are less than 10 steps from one another.   We requested the patio because it was a sunny day. We were the only ones seated outside at the time. Another 10 minutes passed and someone finally greeted us and took our drink order. We weren't quite ready to order because we had questions to ask before making our decisions. She left the water we ordered, answered our questions and disappeared for another 10 minutes.....  My daughter wanted the pita grilled cheese meal, but didn't want the fruit. So, she asked if she could get a salad with chicken instead. The waitress said yes. I ordered baba ganoush and a veggie plate to start and a lamb salad to split with my other daughter.  Here comes the food....and we didn't realize it before they dropped the appetizer,  but we had no silverware nor napkins. When our baba and veggie plate came I couldn't believe how few veggies we got for $4.50. I felt ripped off to be honest. I am gluten free so pita isn't an option. I ordered a small baba and ran out of veggies halfway through. What a rip man! While the baba was flavored really well, it isn't something you want to eat all alone. So, I saved it for my salad. We were all a mess from not having any napkins or silverware so I finally sent my oldest to grab some from inside.  Next came our main meal. The salad was super fantastic quite honestly. The veggies were fresh and the lamb was cooked perfectly. Love the Aladdin's dressing and it was just the right size to split. I used the rest of the baba on my salad so I didn't waste it. But sadly, my daughters meal was very wrong. The server gave her the pita grilled cheese with fruit AND another side salad with 3 pieces of chicken (we asked for 2 chicken). I was completely confused and kept looking for our server to find out what was wrong.....but she was nowhere to be found.  Finally, when we were more than halfway done with our meal, she came to check on us. I questioned what happened with her meal and the server apologized. She said she would see what she could do.....and yet ANOTHER 15 minutes passed. She brought us our bill (they removed the pita and fruit but charged us for the salad and chicken) but frankly, I feel it all should have been removed for the horrible service. But, I am not unreasonable so I put the credit card in the sleeve and waited.....and waited....and waited. I couldn't take it anymore! I told the girls to gather their things and off we went to the register to pay. Only to be told I need to wait for our server to check us out. YIKES! They hunted the server down and I waited yet another 5 minutes to sign my receipt.  The food was very good. We all enjoyed what we ate. But, I will never go back to this location again. The service was really bad and after spending $35 with a $7 tip, I'd hope for more."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Squirrel Hill!  Their hummus is AMAZING.  It's so smooth and has so much flavor.  The oil they add to it also helps.  Tastes so good with the pita.  Yum yum!  I'm going to hunt for an Aladdin's when I come back up to the North.  They have a lot of options for both veggie and meat lovers alike.  Personally I like the mujadara (sp?) which is lentils topped with yummy fried onions.  The chicken and hummus plate is excellent because you get that yummy hummus and some meat to go along with it.  I find that the prices are okay, usually about $7-$10 a dish, which is not too bad.  One thing I didn't like: Their smoothies are kinda overpriced though (like $5 or something) but I did try one, and they're pretty good."}
{"text":"Green beans were fab!  I did not see that quinoa was on the menu for the dish I ordered as grains and I don't get along.  Food was good though.  Didn't notice they had wine, but could've been nice.  Would like more vegetarian options as my friend's dish was pretty much just spinach."}
{"text":"If I could eat any cuisine every day for the rest of my life, it would be Middle Eastern food, and one of the restaurants I would frequent would be Aladdin's.  Great Lebanese salad, lentil soup and stuffed grape leaves.  They also have a fairly large dessert case with seemingly decadent cakes.  I've never been very impressed by their desserts, but I can't fault the place.  I don't go to Aladdin's for dessert."}
{"text":"This is another time when I wish Yelp's rating system would allow half stars.  I'd gladly bump up my review to 3.5.  Believe me, places like Aladdin's serve a need.  Like last night (December 23rd).  I came home from work.  I was all done with Christmas shopping.  I was tired from all this Holiday michigas.  Husband Rick was out doing the last of his Christmas shopping.  I thought, \"What better time to order some take-out, plop my butt down on the couch, and eat while watching some TV?\".  Hey, TBS shows \"Seinfeld\" reruns during dinner time!  So I had me some Len-Chili soup--chili with lentils-for a starter.  For my main course I ordered the Chicken Sambusek Plate:  a pita with curry chicken, onions, peas, and spices.  My sides included mixed green veggies, tomatoes, mushrooms, and olives.  All in all, it was a good way to chow down after tying my hair up and slipping into my comfy old sweatpants."}
{"text":"A great place if you're looking for something other than the typical take-out. I got some hummus and pita bread to go and it was delish. It tasted fresh and was a generous serving for the price...around $6. The serving was equivalent to the size of a container of hummus you'd buy at the grocery store. It was garnished with a little olive oil, seasoning, and a slice of tomato and cucumber.   When I was ordering my hummus I couldn't help but notice the display case full of cakes. There was an apple pie cheesecake that looked like it would have been heaven, but I was trying to be a good girl and resisted the urge to order a slice. It wasn't an easy feat!  It was a great first encounter with Aladdin's. I'll definitely be back! Next time I think I want to try one of their rolled pitas or pita pitzas."}
{"text":"Great food at a decent price. Nice staff. Clean. Great location. Perfect for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"New to the area and wanted to try Aladdin's. So.happy.I.did!! Delicious. Not only was everything cooked perfectly for our takeout order, but customer service was top notch. This will definitely be a new favorite spot for our family."}
{"text":"We were skeptical about this place thinking its some chain restaurant but we were pleasantly surprised how good it is. First off the prices are good. Most Lebanese/Middle eastern food can be pricey (at least in NY) so it was nice to see a place with affordable prices. We got a falafel salad which was huge and filling. We also got the Lebanese salad which again was huge and filling. It also has a ton of flavor from all the different spices they used. The Falafel wrap is highly recommended- not too big and loaded with pickled vegetables , sauce and delicious falafel. The dessert was great too- baklava was great,not too sweet and their peanut butter chocolate cake wasn't too dense but rather fluffy. Id definitely come back here, wish they had locations in NY!"}
{"text":"Great value. Great food. No complaints! I've been to several locations and they never disappoint. Their baba appetizer is delicious and I always order the same thing because it's so phenomenal- Chicken Curry Rolled! Very casual atmosphere and a quick place to stop in for a bite."}
{"text":"I definitely don't get all the four and five star reviews. Maybe I'm missing something. For a chain (I think there's something like 20 of these places in OH and PA) it's definitely tasty enough and if you're new to this type of food it's a nice place to cut your teeth. I've eaten at both their Cleveland Heights and Lakewood locations and they're pretty much identical. It's a sit-down place with table service that sort of feels like somewhere you'd come to a counter to order take-out. The servers are all dressed in ill-fitting black pants (why so tight, people?) and white shirts and the decor is fairly nondescript. I've also never seen any Middle-Eastern people eating there when I've been there for whatever that's worth. I wonder if it's just me?  As others have mentioned the service is hit or miss and our last experience at this particular location was OK. Our server seemed a tad annoyed but I think that comes with being a server anymore. As with most professions, being a server takes a certain kind of personality and it appears to be a rarity anymore. The food I've had is pretty good. The falafal is always tasty, crispy and with just a hint of heat but I find the sauce that comes with it a bit watery. I've also have several of their pita rolls. I wouldn't call them pitas as much as tortillas because they're pretty thin, but they're pretty good albeit on the bland side. The chicken curry roll is a bit strange as I don't really get the combo of honey mustard and curry, but it was decent. The lentil soup was a nice dish full of flavor and loaded with perfectly cooked lentils and potatoes. Great for warming on a winter's day.  Alladdin's is not a bad place to grab a quick bite. Everything I've ever had there was pretty good and if you can look past the slightly cold service your experience will probably be similar. Man, I can't help but wonder what everyone else sees in this place that warrants such stellar reviews..."}
{"text":"Nice casual place to have lunch.  Lots of vegan choices but also their lamb and curry chicken are also very good.  My favorite is the simple Greek pizza."}
{"text":"I really love coming to Aladdin's whenever I am around Squirrel Hill. I can always count on quick service and consistently good food, along with friendly service. Their dessert selection is amazing also, lots of cakes, cheesecakes, and various pastries! The hummus is very solid as well - a regular size order is perfect for sharing between 4 people. The menu is very big and there are a lot of great things, but standouts for me are the hummus, falafel, and Aladdin's Favorite Combo. Prices are very reasonable as well, even for their specialty entrees!"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise and I found out after the fact that there are multiple locations.   The hummus was excellent, although the pita that came with it was uninspired. Tried the beef kofta which was well seasoned and would have been good but it was too salty which was unfortunate. My friend tried a couple of wraps, I think a chicken curry wrap of some sort and another type of chicken wrap. (sorry can't remember) both of which were good."}
{"text":"I stopped by Aladdin's in Mt. Leb for dinner with a friend on a Sunday night. The restaurant was almost empty with the exception of one other table. She was on a strict diet consisting of lean meats and fresh veggies/fruit so she picked the restaurant. I had never been to Aladdin's and was pleasantly surprised by their emphasis on fresh, wholesome ingredients. I ordered Aladdin's favorite combo to get a taste of beef, chicken and kabob. When the meal was served, I was a litle disappointed in the quantity. There was about 2 ounces of each meat. Just enough for about three to four bites. It truly was a taste of each. For the cost, I was expecting a little more. However, the quality of the meal was exceptional. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The meats were juicy and tender. The meal also was served with a small mixed green salad on the side.True mixed greens, no iceberg here. I chose to try Aladdin's dressing which was tangy and delicious. Not being on a diet and having been deprved of chocolate all day, I decided on the most decident chocolate cake I could order. This tower of chocolateness had layers of choclate cake held toegther by chocolate mouse and chocolate ganache. A true choclate lovers dream. All in all, I will for sure head back to Aladdin's for a fresh, casual meal in a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Be prepared fellow Yelpers... Once you start going, you will never stop.   This place is bangin! When you order the hummus... make sure you ask for extra pita (they're a little stingey) and get the hot sauce! It adds a ton of flavor and knocks your taste buds into another realm.   The Greek salad is out of this world! Soft feta cheese, kalamata olives, peppers, chicken, and crunchy romaine lettuce all chopped together and mixed with a house dressing. Can I get a HELL YES?! So good."}
{"text":"Usually I enjoy Aladdin's, I have eaten there many times. Today we stopped for a bite at the Aladdin's in Cuyahoga Falls before grocery shopping. I ordered the Ful M damas it came out very dry and with hardly any flavor. I have had this dish many times and many places around the world. It could be just a different way to serve it but I am not a fan of the way it was served."}
{"text":"Had the most fabulous meal at Aladdins! Went with mom my mom, sister, and husband for dinner and everything was fresh and incredible. we started with grape leaves and agreed they were some of the best we've had, and tried the hummus-like favs bean dip that had a strong garlic flavor we all loved. My sister had the pitza with feta and eggplant, my Mom enjoyed her wrap with baba gannoush and veggies, and I adored the salad with rice, Lentils, hummus and fried onions. My husband chose the platter with hummus, salad, beef kofta, chicken, and falafel. The dressings and hot sauce were also excellent. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Falafels are nice as well. Would avoid the chicken tawook Bc altho tasty there are only 3-4 small pieces of chicken on this pretty large bed of rice. Would be good if the chicken quantity is more.  On certain days they have pretty cheap beer for $2.50. The lamb is good"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Aladdin's on many, many occasions, and have never had a bad meal there. I have tried numerous dishes, as they have a wonderful selection of vegetarian dishes. They even mark their dishes (vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free).  Two of my favorites are the Mujadara Pocket and the Baba Garden Rolled.  The only way they could improve the food would be if the pita came to you still warm right out of the oven.  To me, this location is preferable, NOT because it's in a plaza (which is a negative), but because it is bigger than the Independence and Highland Square locations. (I always feel a bit claustrophobic in those restaurants.)  I also should mention the wait staff....always friendly and attentive.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Sweet deliciousy goodness, is this place for real? I have never walked out of an Aladdin's without being completely stuffed as well as totally satisfied. I mean really, hats off to these guys because their food is not only awesome, its really consistent throughout their locations which I've noticed can sometimes be a problem with restaurants like this.  My typical order is either the hummus or baba for an appetizer, along with a side of vegetables. If you like hummus and hummus-like things but have never tried baba, get it. Seriously, you'll thank me later. Want to jazz it up a bit and get crazy? Ask for their special hot sauce. I don't know what exactly is in this stuff but it's like crack. I would bath in it if that wouldn't be super weird... Get it with the hummus too. One word: heaven.  Anyways, after I eat my weight in appetizers I get the vegan chili. It is honestly so good I have strongly considered ordering two servings of it for one sitting (no I totally do NOT have an eating problem! I swear!)   Back when I wasn't vegan I would get the taza chicken salad. Guys, this dish is legit. Don't let the word \"salad\" scare you away, it is seriously so good and super filling.   I don't think I have ever brought anyone here and had them not be totally impressed with the food and service. In fact, every time my sister comes into town she insists on Aladdin's. My family will even get a huge take-out order right before they leave to drive back to NY so they can have it when they get home. It's that good guys.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out. I promise you will love it. (Ok, so I can't really PROMISE you'll love it, but I am pretty sure you'll at least like it, so go!)"}
{"text":"I want to give this restaurant 5 stars because everything was perfect! The food, the service and cleanliness. I ordered hummus, curry chicken pita wrap and Alladin Favourite platter.  The wrap was just excellent with very complex flavors. Its a must must try. It as priced at $4.50, which is great. I liked it so much that I got 2 wraps to go as well :)  The hummus was creamy and smooth. The platter was good but I would not say excellent because the chicken pieces had dried out a bit, but I wont complain as chicken sometimes gets a little dry.   The service was prompt and our servers were very courteous. I will definitely go back and try more things n the menu."}
{"text":"I visited based on Yelp reviews, and left pretty satisfied. I had the flavor savor special, which is rice, falafel, hommus, salad, kafta, and chicken. The chicken was juicy and tender, albeit a bit small, and the kafta was cooked properly and also very flavorful. Hommus was good, and so was falafel (but just came with one falafel). Salad was average (greens didn't seem super crispy), and the rice was decent, but I'm biased as I have Arab friends who cook rice better than anyone I've ever met so I'm typically disappointed with rice at Middle Eastern restaurants.   Oh and most importantly, when you're there, you MUST order a fresh juice or smoothie. I tried the carrot apple juice and it was amazing, but they all sound terrific. Can't wait to go back and try  more!   Overall, I would go back, especially considering there seems to be few middle eastern restaurants in the area from which to choose. Attentive wait staff, food came out decently quick, extensive menu...and desserts that look heavenly but I was too full after dinner to even try any."}
{"text":"Ive been in here dozens of times. I like the food a great deal. The service is hit or miss. Decor is really cool and mid mod and its clean and nicely decorated with vintage concrete trellises and netted cylindrical hanging lights. Ive had most of their pita sandwiches. Salads are always good. Big and delicious. Priced right. The Greek salad with chicken is always a winner but order an Aladdin salad with gyro meat, my personal favorite. Any of their pita sandwiches are spot on. In particular, try the Shish Tawook sandwich. Parking in the back is free. Dinner for two is around 30 bucks."}
{"text":"This was my first mediterranean food experience in pittsburgh.  My friend and I arrived at this restaurant (two doors away from Rita's), not really expecting much.  Its decor is Cheesecake Factory-esque, and even the menus were bound with the same type of plastic coil used for the menus at Cheesecake.  Anyways, getting to the service...  Our waitress WREAKED OF SMOKE when she came up to pick up our appetizer dish; apparently she had gotten a ciggie in between our dishes, along with a slight headwind.  However, she was a nice waitress, and was very responsive in refilling our drinks when we were running low.  We were seated towards the back of the restaurant, in the awkward corridor between the main dining room and the restroom.  Frankly, I don't think that they should even have tables there....it definitely has that secondary priority feel to it.  We ordered a hummus+pita appetizer, along with their beef kafka and combination signature plates. The hummus had an overbearingly nutty taste to it, which, although not too bad, was quite a surprise to my taste buds.  The beef kafka were all slightly charred on the outside.  Not charred that it gave distinctive texture to the meat, but charred as in I could taste burn chips.  They had obviously left it cooking for too long, and I could tell also because the meat could have been juicier.  All in all, because of its convenient location, I would probably come back if i craved mediterranean food, but in the meantime, I'll be seeking other places to try out."}
{"text":"The ambience was great, the staff was friendly and the food was great! The menu had an amazing selection of vegetarian/vegan dishes. For appetizers, I ordered the Dolmeh(grape leaves) and Falafel. The  Dolmeh was hot (most other places I've had served them cold) which was delicious. The Falafel was out of the world. For main course I had the Veggie 'Pitza' which was decent. The mujjadara plate was really good. It had a lot of lentils (not just filler rice) and also had a lot of fried onions which made it really greasy.   The dessert sectiob had an amazing selection of cakes. I ordered the Black Forest and Baklava cheesecake for takeaway. They were decent too.  Overall, an amazing experience and I wish there were such high quality restaurants everywhere! Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is very good. The mint tea is perfect. Take a large take out middle eastern dessert sampler home. That is a great weekday night meal. Simple but very very good."}
{"text":"I am editing this review due to the quick communication from the owner of the restaurant. As a 15 year restaurant guy, I appreciate management and ownership actually Caring."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Aladdin's for over 12+ yrs. The Lentil soup topped with chicken and feta are one of my favorites items on the menu, the only reason I didn't order it on my most recent visit was the sweltering heat. I chose one of their signature salads, the shawarma, with the house dressing & it was just as tasty as always. At the last minute we decided to take home an order of baba ganoush for a dinner party later that day & it was a big hit.  It was the 1st app gobbled up that night! Consistently fresh food, vegetarian options galore, fair prices and the friendly staff are just a few reasons why they'll always rate a 5 in my book!"}
{"text":"More traditional style Greek food, so no Gyro meat that is mixed beef and lamb. I got the lamb plate and it was really good. Would have like more meat though. The rice was good as was the salad. Got tons of pita bread.  The staff was very friendly and there was a great looking desert display at the register. Didn't partake in any of those though."}
{"text":"I never do reviews. Ever. We were out shopping this way and wanted to try something different. So I suggested Aladdins because they had the best reviews on yelp. I now understand why. At first I was super overwhelmed from the menu and wanted to leave immediately because I had no idea how to pronounce anything and there was just so much going on. Our waitress and the manager were SO HELPFUL! They were so kind and patient, made suggestions on what to try. Oh. My. Goodness. Can honestly said I had one of the best dinners of my life tonight. The flavors were AMAZING! Everything tasted so fresh and delicious. I was not a fan of the side salad, probably because it was good real lettuce and I'm basic and usually eat iceberg, but the manager was not even hesitant. Said nothing you like, I take off your bill. I highly suggest the chicken curry rolled and lamb plate. The rice with cinnamon. Omg. Incredible. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Super nice waitress. The food doesn't blow me out of the water, but it's nice to have a Middle Eastern option nearby."}
{"text":"Healthy and veggie friendly. Tell them to chill on the spray bottle cleaner though. Laid back fresh healthy opt."}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's. The hot sauce is so addicting. Great food, great service. The inside decor is so cute and cozy. The staff was helpful, patient, and friendly. I ordered the tuna steak salad. Tuna was a little over cooked but verfy good flavor and great quality salad. I couldn't decide on dressing so she offered to give me a couple different ones which I really appreciated. We ordered takeout and waited maybe 10-15 min for our food. There is some street parking available but it's limited."}
{"text":"So we have been trying this place after my one star review... And nothing has changed, maybe worse. We ordered a shish kebab salad with no feta and scallions. Guess what? It came with both and we sent it back. What did they do? Remove the fata and scallions and bring it back. Now, all the meat is sort of cover with feta (white spots)... Terrible treatment. They have been going down hill for a very long time. They might charge more if it os going to get the quality a little back to normal. I do see us giving this place any more chance. Sorry :((("}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch places when I want middle eastern food in Cleveland.  The pitas, hummus, pita pitzas... those are my favorite.  Depending on my appetite, I go for either an Ali Baba Pitza or an Arayiss Pitza... delicious!  My only complaint is that service tends to be really slow around 12:30pm and even so around 1:30pm.  The food is fresh, and the baklava is definitely worth the wait.  Don't go here if you only have an hour for lunch.  But go here if you have more time and are in the mood for middle eastern food.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Aladdin's food. I've never ordered anything here that I didn't like, it's pretty healthy, and it's a great value for the price too!   I'm a huge fan of their carrot smoothie, and I always always get their baba with hot sauce. In the winter I almost always get their chicken chili, but I also love their rolled pitas, chicken sambusek.. and everything else I've ever had. The rice with vermicelli that comes with a lot of the specialty plates is really good too!  I'm pretty sure they get some of their desserts, like the cheesecakes, from a local bakery. I don't usually get dessert here, but when I was younger I used to be absolutely obsesssssed with the chocolate truffles. I've never tried their baklava or any other desserts, but I'm sure they're great too!"}
{"text":"I love Aladdins in Sq. Hill for two reasons: the food and the staff. The food at aladdin's is amazing- delicious and healthy.  The wait staff is always helpful and enthusiastic- especially Eva and Rachel.   Start with a fresh fruit smoothie- made to order and always awesome. The flavor savor special is a great deal. The Greek chicken salad, the mujadara plate, and the curry chicken rolled are all delicious and worth getting. Don't forget hummus with the hot sauce- so good. Also the house made garlic sauce is off the chain delicious!   Desserts at Aladdins are also great- the Burma baklava is awesome BUT if they have carrot cake- get a piece- you'll thank me.  The management at Aladdins is also worthy of praise- Shireen has a keen attention to detail and is very compassionate both with guests and her servers.   Thanks for all the great meals!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. I got the cranberry walnut salad with chicken. It was the best salad. The portion is perfect and I love how it's filled with the toppings. The coconut cake is delicious as well. One of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"When I lived down the street from here, I came all the time. And I still try to come as often as possible. The food is great and the portions are usually very generous. The menu is very diverse and able to accommodate any diet. I don't eat rice or beads, and they have a nice selection, as well as vegetarian selections for my vegetarian friends. I never had the pleasure of enjoying any of the very tempting looking desserts, but everyone I know who has had one raves about them. I recommend trying it at least once, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is always good.  My only gripe is that it's a little skimpy on the protein.  Plenty of rice or hummus on the plate, not enough meat.  Aside from that, great stuff."}
{"text":"I can't say enough how friendly the staff is!  You MUST get the Flavor Savor! I usually split it with my husband because there is so much food!!!   Oh and try the green tea on ice!"}
{"text":"I go to school right next to Alladin's and stopped there one night for dinner. I have found that in general, Cleveland doesn't do ethnic food (other than Eastern European) very well. However, at Alladin's every bite of the food I had was good. I had the Flavor Savor Special, and what the name lacks in appeal is more than made up for in the actual food.  It was relatively true to Middle Eastern food and was a reasonable price. I found the server to be a bit unfriendly and the food took a while to get there but it was good enough that I quickly forgot about those things to enjoy the food.  Definitely give it a shot if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Came here spontaneously because the restaurant I was planning on going to was too crowded and ended up having a great dinner. After my experience here and seeing the positive Yelp reviews, I was surprised there wasn't a longer wait for dinner on a Saturday night. We came in and were seated right away. The restaurant has a very causal ambiance but not so much that you feel like you're in a takeout place at all, very simple but nice. Though I wasn't looking for the options, the menu is very vegan, vegetarian and gluten free friendly as each page notes what dishes are appropriate for specific types of eaters. As an appetizer we got the Chicken Sambusek which was so unique and really flavorful. We split it between two people and it was the perfect size for an appetizer. For our meals we ordered the Mediterranean lamb plate which came with rice and yogurt sauce, as well as the Sultan's Shwarma Pitza. The lamb was tender and done perfectly with the right amount of pink, and the rice was fluffy and uniquely flavored with nuts and cinnamon. I've had more flavorful yogurt sauces but this one was still delicious. The Sultan's Shwarma was something I'd definitely get again as well...the combination of beef, onions, tomato, yogurt sauce and herbs was amazing. I also got the free hummus appetizer from checking in. Definitely the most different and unique type of hummus I've had, it was much thinner and more lemony than hummus I'm used to but it was still good. I'd definitely be back again."}
{"text":"What first attracted us to this restaurant was their \"gluten free\" advertisement and with our son's recent health desire to become gluten free we ventured out to try. WHAT A PLEASANT NEW ADVENTURE. Both son's had Jasmine Favorite Chicken Tawook. Neither used the sauce but raved about the flavor. Husband had Aladdin's Chicken Pitza which was unique and tasteful. The Shish Tawook ROLLED Pita was different and flavorful. Also tried the V-Nine soup. Filling in itself.  Couldn't pass on at least trying some desserts. One was the gluten free plain cheese cake just basically a cheesecake without the graham cracker crust. The other was a peanut chocolate checkered cake. We finished it. A definite come back to restaurant. Our server was Tiffany - very attentive knowledgeable and pleasant. But based on how we were initially greeted I don't think you could go wrong going here."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for quite a while, first time as a yelper. The service is very efficient, food to table steaming hot still so, straight to the table. A very nice place to eat healthy and a good place guys, to take a date too. They have beer as well as smoothies, which are healthy and very tasty. I would definitely recommend this place for the vegetarian life style. I had gotten the falafel salad very good, comes with a vinaigrette type dressing. No need to say ill be back soon."}
{"text":"Taza off of Chagrin has better food but the service was far better here!"}
{"text":"Aladdin's Eatery is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I've eaten there so many times and they never disappoint. I think all locations are equally as good, there's really not much difference between the locations.  I always start with the hummus, so good. Some of my favorite dishes are; Len-Chili soup, falafel wrap, mujadara plate, Jaffar & Greek pitzas and the mujadara pocket.  Everything is made fresh, they use fresh ingredients & only olive oil when cooking.  Their smoothies are great too. They use all fruits & veggies and no added sugars.  And don't forget about dessert. Aladdin's has some of the best cakes around Pittsburgh. All desserts are made fresh and local. You have a choice from about 10 different cakes and you can't go wrong with whichever one you choose.  Service is always good. They also have outside tables which I love bringing my dogs with me when I eat there.  If you're looking for some really great food that is also healthy for you then Aladdin's is a must."}
{"text":"I give 3 starts only because I think they have cut back a bit on the portions and raised the prices a bit.  The food is good though, and I cant think of anything I ordered that I didnt like.  Fattoush salad is my favorite.  Parking at this location is tricky.  I parked across the street behind the Dave's market as they had a large lot."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal. I had the Hummus Chicken Plate...a Mediterranean dish of hummus (a large portion), small bits of chicken, tomato, etc. For a few dollars more, I added 3 chicken tenderloin strips...$15 total. Beer was $4. Fantastic meal and plan to return. Price was excellent as well as service. Casual clean environment."}
{"text":"Apparently they used to wheel Aladdin round in a cart, and he'd say can I have one of these, one of these, and one of these for dinner, and point at everything he saw. That's where the expression \"Ala Cart\" came from. ;)  Good middle eastern food in Pittsburgh - two locations - nom nom nom.  Well this is pretty delicious, excllent Kofte Kebab.  They're pretty cheap, which is good, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I'll have to try some other things, but Kofte is my go to dish and they make a good one, not the best I've ever had but good. Bear in mind there is also one of these in Squirrel Hill, and others in nearby towns (I think there are one or two in Ohio too).   But as for their food, I'm impressed, now leave me alone and let me think of the names of at least 35 of Ali Baba's 40 thieves."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is just right, everything about this place makes me happy, even their iced tea! I usually start my meal with the hummus and veggies. Love, love, LOVE those pickles and turnips. I add extras on my wraps every time! My sister got the grape leaves last visit and I can't believe I've never ordered them before! I usually don't prefer vegetarian grape leaves but these were special. I also love the turkey rolled pita, it is just the perfect light lunch.   Last visit I let my daughter pick out a slice of cheesecake from their dessert case. I didn't eat any of it (so proud of myself lol) but man do those desserts look AH-mazing! Oh, and did I mention their service is also exceptional!? Aladdins can't be beat for delicious food, served with a friendly smile, at a great price!"}
{"text":"This place has some yummy food and great smoothies. I went there a few days ago and had the Shawarma Salad with their tomato dressing. It was so good. It came with mixed greens, cucumber, tomato, olives, feta cheese and beef. It was light and everything was fresh. I loved it! They also have a berry smoothie that is really good and tastes fresh as well. The falafel came with tomatoes, pita bread and hummus. Again, it tasted fresh, not frozen and fried. All in all, it was a great food experience. They also have great vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options. Try it!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Alladins dozens of times.  It is one of my favorite Cleveland restaurants.  Maybe they were having a bad day today, but the service at this location was terrible.  Not only did I have a bad experience but two other patrons in line and in the waiting area with me had the same complaints.   Thule service at Alladins is typically good.  The service at this location today was unacceptable.  The food was consistent as it always is.  I will come back if I'm in the area but if service in future is anythi ng like it was today I would never come back to this location."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Very attractive atmosphere and staff are very accommodating. Ordered the curry chicken pita and couldn't stop raving about how delectable it was! Must give this place a try if you haven't yet! YUM!"}
{"text":"Sadly this place lets us down every time we go   The soups are bland  The tables and atmosphere are uncomfortable   The middle eastern sweets are delicious but skip the cakes"}
{"text":"As usual, we go to dinner with our 4 year old and 2 month old. Aladdins is always our place to visit when passing through Fox Chapel. There has never been a wait here and service is always friendly. Im honestly not a big fan of their hummus, but their Baba (eggplant dip) is dynamite! It's super good and we love the pita too. I typically get a bowl of chicken vegetable soup with feta and a side salad. The lamb plate is so tasty ($15) and the rice with vermicelli, pine nuts, and cinnamon is such a good combo too. I've had their pita pizzas, rolled pitas, stuffed pitas too but I always go back to getting the lamb plate or soup and salad. We love their fresh smoothies and carrot/apple juice too! Give it a try... Oh and treat yourself to the diamond shaped baklava... Yummmmy!"}
{"text":"Aladdin's is one of my favorite restaurants in Mt Lebanon. I am a huge fan of Middle Eastern cuisine and Aladdin just tops them all. Fresh delicious food, superior service makes us keep coming back. One of my favorites is Baba Ganoush !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I got the shish kebab platter and it was delicious, the beef was so medium rare it melted in your mouth! The garlic sauce was amazing! The desert cabinet was nearly pornographic! Five or six different cheesecakes, the same selection for regular cakes, and other selections like truffles, tiramisu, blueberry bars, etc.  The menu boasts a raw juice selection, vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, etc!   I wish we had one of these back home!  My only complaint is that the atmosphere was a bit McDonald's like when the food deserved better ! I wish it was a little more cozy!"}
{"text":"The Meditteranean Lamb was excellent.  I really enjoyed both the garlic sauce and the yogart on the side."}
{"text":"A great standby food option.  I like to get their Carry-out.  Lots of healthier food options here.  Some of my favorites are the Aladdin's Favorite Combination (lamb, rice and noodles, and salad with dressing... so Good!), Shishtawook (Chicken with fav Garlic Sauce in a pita wrap - I like it without radish), lentil soup, and mixed apps.  I enjoy making my own custom veg pita pockets by ordering appetizer of Falafel, Hummus, maybe tabouli and salata salad.   :)  Vegetarians would love this place as it has lots of options.  But they have great chicken, beef, and lamb choices too."}
{"text":"Got desert to go, raspberry truffle, tasty but too sweet."}
{"text":"I enjoy how vegan and vegetarian-friendly this establishment is. Their portions are generous especially in light of their prices. I like the hummus, baba ganoush, salads, falafel, and lentil dishes. Even though the cakes look impressive, I don't think dessert is their strong suit. I am also not a fan of the ambience. The restaurant is dimly lit and is not always the cleanest."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. I've gone there few times, and at first it was alright, food was ok, nothing really to write home about, but pretty good anyway. However one time I got very sick after eating there (talking severe stomach pains about 30 minutes after eating there) so I'm not going there anymore."}
{"text":"Pros: quick, friendly service, large menu with lots of options, big portions  Cons: food in general but the hummus and pita was esp. disappointing   I tasted the vegetarian combo app and the hummus falafel rolled. The vegetarian combo app came with 4 falafel, baba ghanoush, hummus, tabouleh, 2 stuffed grape leaves (dawali), and the tahini-yogurt dressing. Everything was just ok. We were served plain pita while waiting for our meal. The pita was the most disappointing to me. It wasn't warm or grilled or anything. Very thin. Tasted like store bought pita fresh out of the packaging. The menu really emphasized their \"award-winning hummus\" so I obviously wanted to try it. It was flavorless, like genuinely didn't taste like anything. We didn't even eat it. The baba ghanoush was better, and the grape leaves were tasty. The falafel was dry and I got tired of eating it. The rolled pita was better and I enjoyed the pickled veggies and radishes inside. The garlic sauce served on the side was what I enjoyed the most.   They had A TON of cakes on display, which looked good but a little out of place at a Lebanese restaurant. I wish I had ordered the cake instead :/"}
{"text":"Aladdin's is one of the staples of our arsenal of places at which to eat on weekdays, and it rarely disappoints.  Their menu is huge, and can be a bit confusing to the uninitiated. The waitstaff does a good job of guiding you through the menu, so you shouldn't have an issue finding a good place to jump off.   Always order the Hummus, and always order the hot sauce with the hummus. Never not order the hummus. The pita dries out pretty quickly, but if you're with a group and you get the hummus, you won't be worried about the pita drying out because it will be gone by the time it gets the chance to dry out.   I haven't had a bad dish here. Everything from the lamb and chicken to the beef is all well seasoned, and nothing too over the top for even a less adventurous eater.   Aladdin's Special would be my recommendation for a beginner, but it's your decision to make.   Save room for dessert, and if you didn't save room, get dessert and take it with you anyhow. Everything they have in that glass case with all of the pretty cakes and stuff is all amazing. Eat all the cakes."}
{"text":"Great option for a quick, healthy Lebanese meal!   Lots of hot and cold teas to choose from, plus fresh juices.   The hummus is good, thinner and with a heavy toasted sesame taste. I can't say it's better than Nate's in Ohio City, but a close second. Really it's that darn hot sauce that makes it! I recommend getting the hot sauce and the veggie platter for extra dipping variety.   The beef or chicken shawarma roll is pretty darn delicious, much bigger than Nate's and with veggies and pickles wrapped in. Is it better than Nate's? Meh, I think it's just as good, just different. Nate's is smaller, but it's just the meat, onions and yogurt sauce. I think it's just whatever you like or are in the mood for.   I've also tried their salad pitas and Lebanese Salata--both delicious and very light. I don't like their house dressing, but that's just because I think it tastes like mint. I hate mint. Try their balsamic--it's delicious!   The service is always super speedy, nice and quick with the refills. Just be careful if you're drinking iced tea. They'll refill you so many times that before you know it, you'll be having heart palpitations from a caffeine overdose."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! I've never had Lebanese American cuisine and I've been missing out. I am completely new to the area and wanted to try local, non-chain restaurant food...  We had a falafel appetizer that did not disappoint. I had the falafel hummus rolled as my meal and it was tasty, too. Not a fan of the turnip but didn't want to modify the order before I even tried it. It was easy to remove from the wrap because it was just one slice.   For dessert, there's something for everyone: cakes, cheesecakes, truffles, tiramisu, cookies, baklava, etc. we had the double stuffed Oreo cake (hub's request) but I would have preferred the cookie dough cheesecake.   Big menu, delicious food! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 20 from work on a Wednesday afternoon at noon. We made reservations beforehand. Everything was set up when we arrived.  One waitress took care of all of us. She did an impeccable job. We all had separate checks and she was definitely on top of it. She refilled waters timely and needed little assistance from her co-workers. Seriously, she was a pro.   I've been to Aladdin's several times prior to this review - and I've always enjoyed it. Food portions are perfect, pricing is perfect, and selections taste wonderful and come out timely.  This was the first time I've been to the Bagley Road location; typically I go to Aladdin's in University Heights - but from location to location, my experience has been consistent and I'm sure I'll be back for more!  This is an ideal lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and healthy based menu.  We eat here whenever we come to Cleveland Clinic and desire healthier eating options.  Tonight  the food was exceptionally good thanks to our server Jaimy who was so attentive to detail, gave us kind and prompt service and above and beyond kindness.  She is definitely the best server we have had here.  Ask for Jaimy!"}
{"text":"The only thing that is better than the healthy, delicious food here in the service from Jaimy!  Talk about wonderful service.  She was bringing us what we needed before we even asked her!  So kind and thoughtful!"}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good and I am such a fan of that one bean-filled cookie thing...(elegant description :) ).  The price is reasonable and the service is always good."}
{"text":"Not my first choice in Mediterranean eateries but still good.  Most of the dishes are a little under-flavored compared to other places.  The felafel is good but they grind it too fine and use a bit too much cumin.  The result is a soft felafel with no crunch to the outside and a very soft center without texture.   Smoothies are excellent.  Vegetarian appetizer sampler is recommended."}
{"text":"Ate the best tiramisu ever, and still can't believe it! We only ordered coffee and cake, (unplanned), ordered the 3-layer chocolate cake and tiramisu with regular and decaf coffee. The decaf was freshly brewed and served with the pot (so refill was free) the cakes were fresh and delish. I usually don't go for heavy cream stuff but this tiramisu was worth it! They also had couple of cheesecakes, carrot cake, chocolate cake with browny, with Oreo, especially they had baghlava cheesecake, this is my next time order!"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to tell you about Aladdin's bc this place is busy enough as it is!  I've hit several middle eastern restaurants in Pittsburgh...Kassab's, Nellie's, Med Grill, ordered from Shiraz...  Everyone says that the nearby Med Grill is better but I disagree, it just never does it for me.  Aladdin's is my hands down favorite, and it's my favorite because it has remained consistently great across multiple locations for several years!    It sucks when you find a menu item at restaurant you love so much you look forward to ordering it every time you dine there, and then...the food changes.  It's like they've rick rolled the menu.  Aladdins and I have known each other for so long and they've never let me down!  (that was so lame.  I am so sorry)  Aladdin's is a mini chain, they have locations in Mt Lebanon, Sq Hill, and the North Hills.  The decor is the same across all the restaurants, it's simple, warm, and inviting.  This is a casual restaurant you could bring a date to, or the family--if your kids will eat hummus.    Aladdin's has my favorite hummus.  I LOVE hummus.  I'm always trying to make my own hummus taste like Aladdin's but it just never works.  All of their smoothies are great, and they are blended fresh upon order--as in \"We are cutting up the bananas for you now!\" fresh, no mixes here!  There's something for everyone on the menu, even the person who hates middle eastern food (just have them order one of the pizzas, or the chicken salad.  the chicken salad is really great).  I have alot of friends who are vegetarian, and several that have issues with gluten and Aladdin's is one of those restaurants where everyone is happy and accommodated.  Here are MY personal favorite menu items:  the hummus the tabbouleh the Diwali roll the falaffel roll the schwarma salad--this is what i usually order.  its an excellent salad with steak on it.  it's delicious!  The desserts are incredible, when you walk into Aladdin's your def going to notice the cakes under the register.  I've never had the dessert there, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but they look amazing!"}
{"text":"I don't even care for chili and I always order it. It's very good. It's homemade so you never know the level of spicy it will be. Aladdin's also has some of the best *homemade* hot sauce. So much so, you can buy a container of it. The hummus is a little soupy and not the best around, but it's still worth ordering before your meal. They have been offering while food smoothies long before it was trendy. If you visit this Cleveland staple, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We love this place. Very reasonable and delicious food.. Don't forget to try their baklava."}
{"text":"Great prices, delicious food, simple, healthy and easy! Chicken shawarma rolled pita was delicious! They also have delicious cakes and pastries!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Aladdin's Eatery and I must say I enjoyed it very much.  We ordered the Vegetarian Combo (a Must) and Chicken Sambusek for appetizer. The portions are pretty generous - so you might actually be able to make this (Veg. Combo) your main entree. It's got bit of everything including homemade hummus.  For the entree, we ordered the Chicken Salad, Aladdin's Fav Combo and a lamb plate. Although, I've read rave reviews about the lamb - I didn't quite enjoy that much - however, my girlfriend loved it. The chicken Salad was amazingly delicious - and the Beef Kafta that came with the combo platter was really good.  The service was great - our server was very attentive and friendly.  Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant in the heart of Squirrel Hill has a tasty range of Middle Eastern-inspired dishes, adapted to Western tastes, and the prices are quite good. We ate as a family with an age range from young to senior citizen and everyone found something on the menu to his or her liking. The falafel was very good, and we also shared the Hummus with Chicken, Baba Gannouj which are eggplant rolls, the Aladdin salad, and the Aladdin's Favorite combination with Beef Kafta, Shish Kabob, and Shish Tawook on a bed of brown rice. This is part of a chain but it has a neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"Great healthy food at a reasonable price.  Desserts look unbelievable, although I didn't have any.  Next time I am in the area , I will eat here again."}
{"text":"What a delightful find,great appetizers, entries and desserts with service to match."}
{"text":"I've been to the Aladdin's in Mt Lebo and the North Hills and been totally unimpressed.  When my friend wanted to come here, I was over it.  However, this Aladdin's was a good experience.  I ordered a falafel wrap ($8.31 with tax) since I had previously been unimpressed with options including meat.  The wrap was awesome.  The falafel was delicious and hot, and it was balanced well.  In Pittsburgh, this is probably the best falafel you can get.  The hummus was also amazing, and I could probably eat it with just a spoon.  Overall, a good place for lunch in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Healthy, yummy dishes with lots of options. Based on the Yelp reviews I popped in for a light meal. Since this was my first visit, I asked my friendly server for suggestions for a light meal - that would include their much touted hummus and hot sauce. She suggested the salad pita bowl with the hummus and hot sauce on the side. I took her up on the suggestion and was glad I did. I selected the tahini dressing for my salad bowl in keeping with the middle eastern flair.  My plate arrived quickly with a thin pita pocket opened like a bowl -- over flowing with fresh greens, cucumber, tomatoes and other goodies. A side plate was filled with hummus and the hot sauce can in a small plastic container.  YUM.  Delicious light dinner with a kick.  When the  server explained that the desserts were made by company that is owned by the restaurant I couldn't resist trying something special -- the baklava. It is delicious. Not as syrupy as I've had other place (a plus).  Can't wait to go back to try one of their grilled meats with the tahini dressing."}
{"text":"I am middle eastern so I thought I'd give this place a shot to see how the west does our food.  I tied this place a couple times even ordered the best off the menu.  It was really bad the food was really bland even though they advertise how much spice and flavor they put into their food.   There was barely any meat in my $16 lamb plate or kabob paters.   The place looks nice and has a nice atmosphere but its broken by the bad food / lack of culture the employees can barely pronounce any of the food names properly. This place is highly Americanized do not expect authentic.   I just feel bad because places like this give a bad rep to real Lebanese Eastern cuisine. Its my culture and they've broken it down, watered it down and made it fake and ugly."}
{"text":"Vegan heaven!!! Just moved to the area and I'm loving this place!! Everyone who works here is so nice and the food is amazing.  I always get the house hot tea and they make sure my cup is alway full.  Every time I get something new and as a vegan I have so many options!!  Love love love!!"}
{"text":"This food is mind-blowing. I came here two nights ago and am back again today. Spicy kofta rolled pita is amazing, as is the soup, and vegetarian appetizer platter.   Do it."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service and good prices.  Do not be put off by the strip mall location. Nice selection of wine and beer.  Steady crowd not too busy.  Very well trained staff."}
{"text":"Great food, as good as the Lakewood location. Nestled in a busy collection of stores, restaurants and a movie theater, the place is comfortable and clean.   The shish tawook wrap with a side of hot sauce is one of my favorite meals anywhere. Baba ganoosh and tabouli are favorites too. Any salad that I've tried has been fresh and delicious. I'm not much for desserts, but friends like their offerings.   I've always had service that is just right - checking the right amount of times. A great place to eat or take out."}
{"text":"Lunched here with coworkers and was delish! Hummus and flatbread for apps and had the curry chicken wrap and side salad. when it was all said and done everyone was stuffed and very pleased. There are Aladdins everywhere so enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to a few Aladdin's and this place is great.  I like the hummus a lot!  Definitely get the hot sauce!  It adds a kick.  I tried the falafal salad and it was enough for two people, but I took the left overs home for lunch the next day.  The service was good, the food was good and I would recommend this place for a casual lunch.   We took my nephew who is a bit of a picky eater.  He went to town on the hummus with pita bread!  He ate a bunch but of course went home wearing some.  It was great to see him try and enjoy some new foods!  (They do have a kids menu,)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some lunch after a morning of golf.  They offer many vegetarian option, which I love!  The hummus is good, very smooth, but a bit expensive.  I had a falafal wrap pita and it was also good.  Nothing super special about this place, but it is a good spot for a quick lunch, especially when you are in the area."}
{"text":"A go to restaurant for my family. Although we all have a favorite menu item, any time we try something new we always enjoy it. The falafel and hummus are great appetizers. The ever-changing desserts are delicious as well. The food always tastes so fresh, the staff is friendly, and the service is fast. I cannot count the amount of times I have been here, and not once have I had a complaint. Will continue to be an easy decision when looking for a restaurant that I know will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Food is very tasty. I always get the chicken pitza which is amazing.  I've tried the platters a couple times which are tasty but seems a bit expensive for the amount of meat for the price. They come with salad or hummus but only 6 small pieces of meat on a big bed of rice. The pita rolls are just okay. Meat again is deliciously flavorful but the rest of the pita is a bit lacking.  I keep going back for the pitzas."}
{"text":"Yum yum I love this place it's clean .. delicious and worth to visit . The style of food is Lebanese . The meal is big so  It's great to share. I would like to visit it frequently"}
{"text":"We order the hummus to go quite frequently just for snack or an addition to dinner.  It's really good with the hot sauce.  Also the diamond baklava (sp?) is really good.  Always quick service."}
{"text":"Have eaten any many different locations, but this particular one the last two times I have been there for dinner I have had unusually poor service. We have had the same server the last two times and he has been extremely inattentive. I may chalk it up to youth and inexperience, but it is still frustrating nonetheless. Food is on par with all of the other locations, just the overall service here seems to lack."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for lunch on a weekday. The restaurant was fairly busy but we were seated and served quickly. We ordered the kibbie plate, and then I had the Aladdin's chicken pitza and she had the Chicken hummus plate.   The kibbie, essentially coated and fried mounds of ground meat with pine nuts, comes with a yogurt sauce and cucumber tomato salad. Very tasty and the crunchy exterior contrasted the texture of the pita that was served with it. I kinda wish the pita was warmer and tasted a bit less chewy.   Pitza, their version of pizza, was the best thing we tried. Toasted pita topped with garlic sauce (VERY strong but in a good way) with nicely marinated chicken and a dijon glaze on top. They also sell pitzas with more traditional fair like shwarma and falafel etc.   Rachel had the chicken hummus plate and while the chicken was prepared nicely, it was just not enough chicken for how expensive it was. The surrounding hummus was good, but Algebra cafe's hummus fills my hummus fix more emphatically. Same complaint about the pita here.   Waitress was normal with her service, which can be either good or bad depending on the person experiencing said service.   Buh!"}
{"text":"Very fresh food. Everything we had was delicious. Especially the falafels. Best I have ever had.  Staff was courteous and setting was very inviting"}
{"text":"Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but i have definitely experienced better.  The food (i got a specialty plate) lacked enough flavor to make me think of almost flavorless.  I think their desserts looked fantastic, I should have ordered that instead!"}
{"text":"I like the Aladdin's Eatery chain. It's clean tasting food with lots of options and reasonably priced.  The turkey salad, as plain as it sounds is actually quite good. I get it with the Aladdin's House Dressing instead (light on the dressing) and I ask for a side of their garlic sauce, which is VERY garlicky to add a little more flavor and kick.  Their hummus is very smooth and creamy, slightly thinner than you'd expect. It's well flavored and while slightly higher price point for an appetizer both the small and large options are hearty portions. The small can easily be shared by 4-5 people.  The pita is rather mediocre.  It's thin, dry and while warm when it comes out, it stiffens quickly when it cools.  The service here was really good today.  Andrew was great with our large group. He was patient, helpful and made sure we were doing great."}
{"text":"Highlights from our recent Saturday lunch visit:  1. Despite being the first people in the restaurant, our server did not appear at our table for almost 10 minutes. 2. My lamb wrap was relatively devoid of meat, and  3. My wife found a hair in our felafel.  Suffice it to say, we'll go elsewhere for Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with family in tow on the snow/wind chill day...and very happy I did.  Apps - hummus, tabouli, and foole m damas (my wife's favorite).  I focused on the first two, and was thoroughly pleased.  They served it with a hot sauce that was pretty dang good, too.  Main - the Mediterranean Lamb Plate was spot on.  Decent lunch-size portion, and the waited was kind enough to bring garlic and tahini sauce.  The wife and kids were happy with their meals, as well.  May have to come back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Yeah its a chain, but it has an independently owned quality to it.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is amazing - definitely get the hummus! Also love the falafel, the fattoush salad, and my husband loves the flavor savor plate. We've never been disappointed here. This is one of our favorite places to get takeout, but dining in has also been enjoyable."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here the staff have been so friendly and attentive. So far I've tried something different each time I've gone to an aladdins and I haven't been disappointed yet"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite place to eat when I have the chance.  You can't go wrong with anything off of the menu!    I usually get hummos and a rolled, usually falafel hummos.  I do ask them to exclude the turnip and pickle (yuck).  The mujadara and chicken salad are delicious.  I have also had their side salad which is pretty impressive!  You can't go wrong with the Aladdins Kabob rolled.    You can't help but notice their deserts when you walk in!  Save room if you can  indulge in one of their delicious cheese cakes.  The only weird thing about this place is that you have to walk through the kitchen to use the rear entrance or rest room."}
{"text":"Went here on Christmas Eve.  Cant go wrong with any in the franchise, yet this one the service was wonderful. Our waitress was so sweet and friendly and for a holiday when everyone can be irritable. Wow she was amazing. Food of course was great. Love the vegetarian options. Yet thank you. I dont know your name. Yet you are awesome!  The cookies which I've not even had before were awesome.  One was called the Burma. Will be buying them when I come in again."}
{"text":"Strawberry smoothies are awesome. Perfect sweetness to it with the honey in it. The veggie chili and V-9 soup are tasty as well. The hummus is good with fresh parsley and oil drizzled on top."}
{"text":"When I think of affordable, flavorful ethnic food options in Cleveland (whether on the west side or east side), I think of Aladdin's. I love all the delicious, interesting wraps available within the $5-7 price range. Shwarma rolls are always a great bet and I also love the salads here. Hummus is a must! For dessert, don't hesitate to get the Baklava.   Stop by any of the Aladdin's Eateries if you are in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite middle eastern restaurant, hands down. They have amazing rolled pitas - I can vouch for the Aladdin's lamb one and the chicken shawarma one. Their collection of authentic desserts is also great!   I have also tried their chicken salad in the past, which was delicious!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I can't say I've ever had a great experience at this Aladdin's location. I've been going to the Hudson and Akron locations for years, but whenever I go to the chagrin location the service is not great and the food tastes different. The hummus last time I went it was much thicker and had less flavor than other aladdins locations. The hot sauce also tastes different. The servers are usually young high school boys that seem nervous and don't seem very experienced as a server. The last time we were there, it didn't really seem like anyone knew what was going on. Server A said she'll be right with us, we waited a while then Server B came over to take our drink order, we ordered from Server B, then Server C came over and asked for our drink order, we told her we already ordered. Server A then came back almost 10 mins later and asked for our drink order. When we told her Server B already took our drink order a while ago, Server A said \"no! I'm taking the drink order\" and made us order our drinks from her again! We finally got our drinks but it was a really uncomfortable and weird experience. Overall, I like the other Aladdin's locations better for both food and service."}
{"text":"A comfy, dependable little spot for a great hearty lunch or a casual dinner. They specialize in mediterranean fare and have a HUGE menu, with lots of choices for carnivores, vegetarians and vegans alike. I've been many times so will list some of my favorite items:   --Hummus: huge portion, creamy and tangy. Get it with the garlic sauce as an accompaniment if you have time to brush your teeth multiple times in the aftermath.  --Jaffar's Pizza: My favorite thing on the menu.  Crispy pita bread, topped with their amazing veggie chili (chock full of beans, veggies, spices, and flavor), then COVERED with cheddar cheese, scallions, and tahini.  It's in the style of Taco Bell's Mexican pizza, but so much better (and you know, likely healthier)  --Falafel rolled pita: Perfectly cooked falafel that's relatively easy to eat in sandwich form --Mujadara Plate: vegan offering of lentils and rice. So filling and warming   --Jasmine's Favorite: another vegan choice ... beans, veggies, rice. A nice selection for when I'm trying to stay on the healthy side of the tracks   They also have fresh-made juices (the basic carrot-celery is my favorite), and a decent selection of well-priced beers and wine.    Prices are great, the huge choice of desserts is beyond belief (I'm not a sweets fan but they look as though they were created by Michelangelo himself), and the service is always reliable. In the summer they have a nice little patio with about 10 tables off to the side, but dining inside is perfectly comfortable as well."}
{"text":"There are many Aladdins' around town and they're all generally pretty good. This one in Strongsville, however, is the exception. It's new and it shows. They're nowhere near ready to be open. Wait staff is untrained, and the food was below average to average at best.   To their credit, the management is aware, and she asked me and my party directly about the food and the service. We were polite, but honest. The fact is, it was a subpar experience. She knew before she asked us, and I can appreciate that she still asked; she wanted to elicit the bad news so it can be addressed. That's a tough, but important part of the job in the restaurant business, so kudos to her.   Listen, I'm usually a fan of Aladdin's, especially for a chain, but I won't be back to this one for a few weeks. I hope they're able to get it together because the location is convenient. In the meantime, I suggest you try one of their other locations."}
{"text":"Stopped by this chain on the way through town. Food was quite good and the staff was nice and professional. Bathrooms could use some work, but that was the only complaint. Desserts looked great, but good luck saving room."}
{"text":"My parents and I wandered in here after a Sunday afternoon of furniture shopping, having zero clue about the food or the prices. Luckily, we were pleasantly surprised. The food was fresh, healthy and delightfully affordable. I recommend the chicken lentil soup, though I thought the hummus was a bit too bland. My father raved about the Shawarma Salad (beef and lamb strips over mixed greens), and my mom loved the Rolled Chicken Salad Pita. Our neighboring diners had the falafel, which looked delicious.   What I especially love is that Aladdin's is a great place for vegetarians and carnivores to eat together in harmony. I can't wait when my college friends come out here to visit. My only suggestion would be to spice up the interior a bit. It doesn't need to become a cheesy harem, but right now it looks like a generic Panera Bread."}
{"text":"I love it here. Been coming for over ten years since they opened way back when. I've had everything on the menu. I love the hummus and tabouli. The best that I have ever had anywhere in pittsburgh. The hummus is so creamy and delicious that I rarely enjoy anyone else's. The wraps and salads are my go-to's. I find the rice dishes to be alil mushy for my liking and would not generally recommend. Stick to everything else!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Love the hummus with hot sauce and fatoosh with chicken."}
{"text":"When our family can't come to a consensus about where to eat, Aladdin's is always a safe bet. Everyone can find something they like on the menu (which is pretty wide-ranging). The only thing I don't like is their room temperature pita that they serve with everything. How much effort does it take to toast/ warm it up? On the plus side, they serve fresh pressed juices which are rare to find at typical sit- down restaurants. I also like their falafel appetizer, baba ganoush, hummus, chicken curry wrap and pitzas. The desserts in the display case look delicious though I have never tried any. All in all a decent place with reasonable prices and consistently good food."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to an Aladdin's & also my first time eating middle eastern food. We decided to stop by on a Saturday. I introduced my friends to Waterworks Mall (more importantly, Five Below!) & then we decided to have a late lunch here since our one friend is actually from Egypt- we figured he could help us order.  We ordered the Kibbie & Dawali as appetizers. Wow, the Kibbie was great and full of amazing flavor. I truly didnt know what I was missing until I tried that! Our friend joked around that his mother can make it better, but I really don't know how. Aladdin's Kibbie was pretty tasty. The Dawali was okay.. a little too sour due to too much garlic & lemon (a little goes a looong way) but we put it on our fresh pita bread and made it work. Not too bad at all.  For lunch, I ordered the Flavor Savor Special which is Chicken Mishwi, Beef Kafta, seasoned rice, salad & hummus. Now that's a true flavor savor! I enjoyed everything & became full pretty quickly from our double appetizer. I only finished half & the waitress was kind enough to box it for me & add SUPER fresh pita. Bobby enjoyed it later after missing out on our awesome trip.  Overall, the food was flavorful & filling;. The service was okay & we had a nice time. I debated on giving Aladdin's a 3 star for an A-ok rating, but the fact that they make  really fresh food plus have many options for GF & vegetarians knocks it up a notch.   Good times!"}
{"text":"I was in Mt Lebanon on my way home from the mall and initially planned on eating at another spot across the street. It is closed on Sundays (despite hrs on yelp) so I decided on Aladdins. This wasn't my first time to an Aladdins, but my first time at this location. It seemed smaller than what I was used to but i was doing takeout and solo so that didn't even matter.   I ordered the Chicken Sharwarma Rolled (as in rolled in a pita). It was seasoned chicken thigh, tomatoes and onions (I opted for grilled onions) with a tahini sauce. I really enjoyed the wrap. It was fresh and came out in no time. It was under $7 and did the job for a quick lunch to go.   The outdoor seating here was great for people watching in mt lebo."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy. I have tried many times. Everything is fresh and delicious. The grilled chicken with rice is extremely flavorful."}
{"text":"I love their hummus. It's slightly smoky (perhaps my imagination), creamy, and a bit tart. Really fantastic. My favorite I've found in Cleveland. I also cannot get enough of their Greek chicken salad. I'm a lucky lady to have this location around the corner from my apartment. I've never tried any dishes at Aladdin's that weren't fabulous.   Heads up, their spinach pie is a pie...not a spanakopita. I once ordered a spanakopita for pick up and wound up getting something different than expected.  Also, be sure to get a side of their hot sauce. You may find yourself tempted to drink it. No judgement here. I've certainly been there ;)."}
{"text":"Bar none the worst falafel in town. So bad it tastes like frozen falafel microwaved and served in a pita that would make Wonder Bread envious of its cheapness. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Very good food. From soup to desserts. Although cake sizes have gotten smaller. Lentil soup so  good.."}
{"text":"A great middle eastern place to eat, fast and friendly service. Greek Salad and Fattoush Salad are great! The desserts are amazing. Love this place."}
{"text":"Same delicious food as the Oberlin location; same great service  (this time, by the very personable Neil who provides this great service by running to and from the kitchen).  Enjoyed  Jasmine's Favorite, which really needs one of the toppings; it was even better the other day topped with Lebanese Insalata.  Enjoyed the outrageously delicious strawberry smoothie and the V-9 soup. Portion sizes of everything I ordered were large.  Nice interior; ignore the strip-mall location.  Wish this franchise would expand to my home state. I will miss Aladdin's."}
{"text":"Food is great, fresh and quality. Great spot for lunch or dinner. I've eaten at this location at least 200 times over the last years since my office is two blocks away.  They do suffer from service staff turn over and it shows. It's an expectation to wait for your drink and probably won't see a refill..  Look for a great meal, fairly priced and you will leave happy."}
{"text":"I love Middle Eastern food. Being that I am not from this area, I was not sure what would be good. It's close to my job and a few co-workers invited me to. Best decision ever!!! I love hummus and Lebanese Salada. Theirs is amazing. Yes, Salada is simple-cucumbers, tomatoes, onions with seasoning and olive oil. It still is just so good.  Their hummus is more than just crushed chick peas. It's creamy with a nice lemon flavor but not too much lemon. Some say it was a little pricy for what it was but I didn't think so. It was priced like any other restaurant of its kind. I'm not into desserts but thought about trying some. They looked so good. My meal was a Dijon Chicken Rolled with a side of hot sauce. It was great! The sweetness of the Dijon was just enough to quiet down the hot sauce. It wasn't dry by far. I'll probably stick with these three things from there because they were so good. I highly recommend going there!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Tuesday night to try our hand at Lebanese cuisine and was absolutely thrilled. The staff was politely attentive, and we were seated, had our orders taken and had food served in what felt like an instant. It was tough narrowing down the delicious looking menu, but ultimately we ordered the Tuna Steak Rolled Pita (so glad I introduced myself to turnips here where they were well prepared) and the Mediterranean Lamb Plate (I swear I heard my boyfriend have a food-gasm across the table). Best meal I've had in months. If we were local, it'd be a perfect usual spot for date night. Come cook in our neck of the woods, Aladdin?"}
{"text":"Good food. Kind service- quick service. Juice smoothies are refreshing addition to typical middle eastern menu. Casual dress."}
{"text":"good quality, fresh, tasty. does not disappoint. the hummos and tabouli is perfect, especially if you add chicken and its a complete meal. I live in NY and wish that they had a location closer to me. I travel to Pittsburgh monthly and each time I am in town, I go at least 2-3 times.   the staff knows their stuff and the manager is a true delight."}
{"text":"Stopped before the airport. Everything I wanted, fast, clean, tasty & fairly priced. Would definitely go back & plenty of options for everybody... also there dessert case looked immaculate! Too full to try... clean bathrooms as well which always appreciated."}
{"text":"Keep it healthy, Pittsburgh! Great veggie juices, good salads...very flavorful !!  My partners favorite is the \"Lebanese Salata\". It's a vegetarian salad, so I went for one of the grilled chicken salads and it was really savory and fresh."}
{"text":"Could it be that Aladdin's was a direct contributor to Cleveland's famed culinary revolution?  Don't look at me that way just yet - let's review.  First, let's get the review in of this location in particular.  I've never had a bad dish here - ever.  The selection of Lebanese and other variations of middle eastern cuisine are always delicious, always prepared correctly, and are always presented wonderfully.  Plus - you can't go wrong with the health factor with the wide selection of teas, salads, and other vegetarian dishes.    Personally, I'm a fan of the mujadara-anything (any variation including the roll, salad, and entree dish).  And the hot sauce is a perfectly balanced homemade mix better than any wing place I have been to.  Service is always friendly regardless of which location I go to - I come to expect it regularly!  Yet the big point I'm trying to make is that it isn't a purely ethnic restaurant.  It takes wholly-non-American ethnic tastes and presents them in a way that's familiar to the average suburban American palate.  Salads, entree dishes, wraps - it's probably not something you'll find in a purely ethnic middle-eastern restaurant.  It introduces the average suburbanite to something outside of standard Americana in a safe way and encourages them to try something different.  After they take that first baby step at Aladdin's they can move on to something even more outside of their comfort zone and enjoy exploring what more that northeast Ohio's new restaurant scene has to offer.  So to those who get tired of hearing about Michael Symon, Slyman's, Jonathan Sawyer, and Sokolowski's - head on over to Lakewood and say thank you to those who get the suburbanites out of Applebee's and into supporting our beloved Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been to Aladdin's twice.  Once for lunch on a Sunday and once for dinner on a Saturday.  When I was there on Sunday, I felt like I wasn't trendy enough to be eating there.  The diners around me were all dressed to the nines and seemed like they were trying to outdo each other in the amount of designer gear they were wearing and stories about their adventures from the night before.  We were seated right away and seemed to have just beat the rush as about a half an hour later, every single table was packed.  Our food was good but nothing to write home about.  Service was decent but not the best.  The second time I went with a part of four around 5:30 on a Saturday evening.  Once again it appeared we just early enough to beat the dinner rush.  The vegetarian appetizer was tasty but filling.  I almost didn't have room for my entree.   I ordered the \"honeymoon\" juice which featured carrots, cucumber and grapes.  The strongest flavor was the cucumber which was fine by me since it is one of my favorite vegetables.  My entree was the jasmine rice with beef.  It was flavorful and the beef was tender although I preferred the taste after I added the hot sauce that was provided on the side.    Service was pretty good and drinks were quickly refilled.  My complaint from this visit was that it was really hot in the restaurant.   It was 90+ degrees that day, but it felt like the air conditioning wasn't on (or if it was, it wasn't working properly).  By the end of our meal, it seemed as if it had finally kicked on.  Overall, the food was decent and I had an enjoyable experience but I'll probably try other places in the area before I return to Alladin's again."}
{"text":"Great food and service! A little pricey for the amount of food you get but overall satisfied!"}
{"text":"For many months we ate here almost once a week.  Its not terribly authentic middle eastern food but it tastes good, seems healthy and the service is pretty quick.  We like the fact that we can have a reasonable meal and be out of there in 45 minutes.  My wife and I have often commented that we often leave feeling good about having eaten the food.   A typical dinner for us is the chicken chili soup, lamb salad, chicken mishwi salad and a shawarma roll.  Jasmine's rice & veggies are another favorite.  They do have the traditional dishes-- hummus, tabouli, baba ganoush, etc also.  They are fine but not exceptional.  I should mention that the menu is actually quite long with all the variations of the basic items, so you have to experiment with various dishes.  This is one of the few restaurants that my daughter (10) likes to go to.  Kids Pitza is a good standy."}
{"text":"Very tasty but Avoid ordering online, call in! It takes 30 minutes for their system to update with the order, so minimum wait is 40 minutes for online orders."}
{"text":"the one thing it is consistent on is being a disappointment. They are not very nice to their customers (and you know me with customer service...) there are just so many better Mediterranean restaurants around town! Dont waste your time!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place knocked my socks off when it came to gluten-free options! The first time I've eaten here and I will be a repeat customer for sure. As a matter of fact, I ended up at 2 different Aladdin's Eatery's in one weekend because I was so impressed with their food.  Their entire menu is marked with gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan and nut coding so you can clearly identify which foods are safe. This worked great for my husband and I because he is allergic to nuts and I have celiac disease. We struggle with Mediterranean restaurants because they typically use lots of nuts and nut oil which causes him to go into anaphylactic shock. Check out their menu!   Another reason to get excited is their juice options. I got the grape, carrot and cucumber juice for our brunch and it tasted great!  We started with the falafel appetizer and tahini sauce. It was great. I even bought a gluten-free falafel mix at the grocery store to make them at our house. We will probably bake them instead of frying them. But I'm glad to have a new option instead of rice and quinoa.  My main dish was Jasmine's Favorite with falafel. I had the lean beef the other night with this dish and I was very pleased. My mom had the same thing but got chicken as the meat option. She loved it.  My husband had a pita wrap both times and enjoyed them too! There are plenty of options for everyone there.  I highly recommend Aladdin's Eatery for gluten-free dining!"}
{"text":"Food was ok for the price. I ordered lamb kafta it was not cooked properly. Other than this , everything thing was fine. When I went there was around 10:30 and they almost ready to leave. I can understand why food was not cooked properly."}
{"text":"It was \"fine\". The service was fine. The food was just very bland. The falafel was so dry and tasteless and the chicken shwarma was also pretty bland. I wouldn't go as far as saying the food was bad by any means, it just wasn't very good."}
{"text":"save your money the meat is chewey and over cooked, salads are wilty, owners are bossy"}
{"text":"Love this place, no matter what location.  Always clean fast and delicious food. The chicken len chili is our favorite. Staff have always been attentive and courteous. Don't forget to get the hummus and pita bread also another favorite."}
{"text":"Hooked. I order online and pick-up at least once a week. Aladdin's salads are always fresh. Rolled pitas, dawali (grape leaves), lentils... I've yet to try something I didn't love. My current obsession is their Chicken Curry Pitza... Amazing. Whatever rub they use on their chicken is so earthy and delicious. I think I'll grab something for lunch today. Great place to dine if you're trying to ditch processed food. Plenty of vegan and gf items."}
{"text":"This is one special place:   The food is always great and consistent.  Bold flavors and well made to order food and plates.  The choices are wide and every item is awesome.  The service is wonderful and consistent.  The hummus dip is amazing.  The shawarma is done very well and fab.   Love this place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites for a low key meal.  I actually worked as a waitress one summer at a Columbus location. Their chicken salad pita pocket, mujhadara and mediterranean lamb plate are my favorites.  The price range us around 7-15$, so reasonable if not on low price side.  Excellent baklava and smoothies.  This location as free parking in the back in coveted Cedar Fairmount.  Keep in mind this place is sort of Americanized Middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Overall my family was pleased. My wife and kids have food allergies...gluten and corn. Way to go on having dishes that address such allergies! The only issue was that the quinoa needs to be rinsed several times to keep the bitterness down before it is cooked. I will seek a return visit next time I pass through Mentor!"}
{"text":"Such a great spot for a light meal and a healthy option. Outdoor and indoor seating and bomb smoothies. Loved the mango one!! The menu is a bit extensive but in my opinion, its the same meats in different layouts. Kinda disappointed by the platters because the meat was little and the rice took up more than half the plate. But I loved the pita sandwiches because it had a nice balance of veggies and meat. For my family the experience was different depending in what you ended up ordering because we wanted all meals to have a serving of vegetables. However, the descriptions are there so read them, super helpful!!  I liked the beef sharwarma but no so much the kofta that was made."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience dining in Aladdin's. I frequently visit here, especially for lunch as I find the service really quick and efficient. Their lentil soup is pretty amazing, and comes with a pita bread on the side. I usually get the chicken shawarma wrap for lunch, which comes nicely wrapped up. I also particularly like to get the hot sauce on the side to accompany the wrap. The chicken pieces are succulent and highly flavorful. They have a wide range of entrees, and I particularly like the Jasmine's favorite.  I also get the baklava to go sometimes (for a party or a potluck). They have multiple types of baklavas and some gift boxes as well. They have a collection of pastries, which are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Delicious! I took my friend there after the gym and Peter was our server.  I dont think I have ever had a better server, anywhere. He greeted us as we walked in with excitement that we chose Aladdin's to eat our lunch. He had suggestions from our beverage, to the appetizers, to our meals. He asked questions to get an idea of what we liked (meat, vegan, veggies) to how hungry we were. He knew exactly what was in each dish we questioned him about.  He came back just enough to fill our almost empty drinks, replenish our pita, box our food, and make sure each dish was cooked to order and delicious. Both managers dressed in business casual were friendly with well wishes on our way out. My friends words to me were gratitide for helping her find her new favorite place. Thank you Peter.  We will be back. If only there were more servers, and restaraunts like you!!"}
{"text":"I come here almost weekly, and all I can say is the service is great, fast, and food is delicious. Aladdin's has a huge HEALTHY menu. They are also great for take-out. Here are some of my favs: Chicken Pitza  Hummus- with Garlic and Hot Sauce and of course the Pitta Baba V-Nine Soup Any of their Chilis Beef kafta Chicken Tenders and Fruit Any of their Smoothies/Juices   Also, if you have a sweet tooth, Aladdin's is definitely the place for dessert. Don't forget to check the counter with numerous cakes, cookies, and baklava.   (The Caramel, Chocolate Chip cookie is hands down the BEST)"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and authentic. I enjoyed the Tabouli and the Flavor Savor Special with a side of their hot sauce."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Aladdins. Being a big fan of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food I was anxious to try a small variety off their menu. I ordered the Flavor Savor Sampler for $10.25. It comes w chicken, Kafta Beef served on a bed of jasmine rice, a salad w a side of humus and falafel. All were very good. The humus in particular. Very creamy and flavorful. The meal includes a side of pita and \"hot\"sauce. Not extremely hot but very good. The pita was delicious-unlike most pitas it was very thin and airy. I added 2 glasses of Pinot ( $5) to complete my dinner. The service was very fast and extremely friendly. I will come again to try some other meals and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"I have had dinner here three times so far and still counting. I have ordered something different every time I visited this restaurant and everything was always delicious. This restaurant is perfect for a simply delicious date night dinner."}
{"text":"The proteins we're all overcooked. I love their Squirrel Hill restaurant. This one is new and they definitely need a better trained cook staff. The beef was grilled I guess and had gritty residue on the beef from an unclean grill and the tuna wasdo overcooked it was tasteless and tough. Unfortunate outing"}
{"text":"I've been to the Aladdin's in Middleburg Heights a couple times but, it doesn't compare to this one in Westlake.   The service & the food is great! The chicken shawarma rolled pita is one of my favorites. A new favorite of mine is the chicken pitza. Make sure to leave room for dessert because they have some amazing decedent cakes. Such a great place for lunch & for a light-ish dinner."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE! I've never had a bad meal nor something I didn't like from here. I've never tried other locations. I sometimes order some Diwali if I'm nearby and starving, because I can eat those while driving and they're wicked delicious little green tubes of love! One time I had A lamb rolled pita and some bits of the meat were a little chewy, but the flavor was awesomesauce...so I just chewed a little longer, no worries. Due to schedule conflicts within my house, we can rarely go out for a meal, so we order take-out from here at least once a month, they pack everything up really nice and have never forgotten anything. They always ask if we need plastic cutlery too. The only dessert I've had is the fruit and yogurt salad because I'm a celiac, I LOVE that salad (dessert, to me!) drizzled with honey and a sprinkle of walnuts, so yummy!  Before I knew I was celiac my favorite dish was the Fatayer Plate, I miss being able to enjoy that!!  I ALWAYS order the large Hummus so my son and I don't fight over it! He eats it with pita, I eat it with veggies I cut up at home. When I have dined there, the service has been really good. TRY IT!!"}
{"text":"Just got off the plane and needed some food. Yelped and found Aladdin's Eatery. Loved that their menu indicated allergens so no need to ask your server \"does this have nuts\"? Husband ordered the Aladdin's favorite and I got Jasmine's favorite - mine was ok, so once I tried Aladdin's favorite I was loving his plate more than mine. Love that my hubby switched plates :) Good food, big portions and decent prices."}
{"text":"Love it! So fresh, and so many vegetarian options. The vegetarian chili, alladins hummus rolled, and the mujadara pocket are my favorite! They used to have this great almond dressing years ago that I was obsessed with, but the house dressing is honestly great, too. Also, try the baklava, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is \"my people's food\". And it's pretty good.  Not perfect but good.   Staying in a hotel down the street and remembering I had a good bottle of cab there, I ordered to go.    I ordered the hummus schwarma, a regular tabouli and a shistawook rolled.   I asked for extra lemon because Lebanese use a LOT.   And it was a good thing too. The hummus had no taste.  No garlic and no lemon.  What up with that? The tabouli, however had lots of lemon.  It was terrific.  It could have used more bulgar wheat and I can't believe I'm saying that because usually restaurants use too much.  But this needed more to soak up the lemon and give the parsley some body. But it was very good.  Tabouli is Lebanese Viagra.  LOL The rolled shistawook was interesting.  I love pickled turnip and it's very Arab and it was there. The chicken was ok but some pieces were stringy and lost in all the flavors of the turnip and dressing.   Still, I got my Lebanese fix in Independence, OH.   Who knew?"}
{"text":"I like the Mt. Lebanon location more, I think.  Sq Hill was always so busy.  I like the unique menu, good service, and I don't miss the naucious feeling that you sometimes get from some restaurants."}
{"text":"WTF?  Jasmine's Favorite dish is apparently frozen vegetables, microwaved with canned beans, rice and chewy lamb. Wow... I'm not sure why would anyone go out for dinner if that's the grub they serve. Maybe they're better for lunch but for dinner, I don't recommend it.  Dessert did look delicious."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Aladdins.  They have the best hummus. Don't forget to get the hot sauce!  You won't be disappointed. Always great service. A few table outside of you prefer to dine outdoors.  The only downside I wish it would be a bit easier to get takeout at this location but sometimes parking can be an issue if you just want to run in real fast.  Otherwise, it's my fav place!"}
{"text":"Yuck. So unauthentic. Makes me ache for Detroit Middle Eastern options."}
{"text":"My experience here was very average, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  It's a very Americanized flavor of Mediterranean food, but the restaurant was clean, the service quick and astute, and the overall meal was nice, if not a bit lacking in flavor.   I had the chicken shawerma and a side of felafel. The hummus that came with the felafel was good, as was the felafel, but the hummus was just alright.   Not a bad introduction to Mediterranean food, but I'd suggest a more authentic place to get some really great stuff."}
{"text":"I'm so obsessed with the vegetarian sampler appetizer. It might not be called that, but something close to that. It's around 12 dollars and I usually split it into 2 meals- has grape leaves, hummus, tabouleh, baba, 4 falafel, pita, and two dipping sauces on the side. I've also tried a pita wrap that was pretty good, but it wasn't very filling. It had hummus and tabouleh in it. The wrap was around 6 dollars. I haven't dined in, but carry out service is good and so is the food."}
{"text":"This is one restaurant I have to eat at every time I'm  in the \"Burgh\". I have eaten at this location as well as the Fox Chapel location which is my favorite.  I always order the mediterranean lamb plate its always cooked perfectly and always tastes great. Desserts are not bad either. Nice spot for a healthy meal."}
{"text":"I kept passing by as I was visiting, and the cakes in the display caught my eye, and  I had to come in.  I ordered a slice of the strawberry shortcake and a slice of the coconut- both were great! I shared with my better half along with coffee, and that was absolutely perfect! Definitely made justice to the eye catching display.  I know they have a full restaurant, but I can not comment on the food, but if you need a great piece of cake- they do a great job!"}
{"text":"I was excited to finally try out this place!!!!  It has been on my task list for a while now.  Because you know being a flex-vegan this is right up my alley!  We went here as a late night dinner option and I was excited to see that they were open until 11pm.  I think with it being so late and not so many people there, our server was as attentive as I wanted them to be.  But that is ok!  They were still good.  For an appetizer we ordered the hummus plate.  Which I could eat all the time!  They also brought out WARM pita bread.  Let me repeat that.... WARM PITA BREAD!  I think I was should on Aladdin's when I realized the pita bread was warm.  They were also individually wrapped.  There are so many options for vegetian and vegans!  So I didn't even know what to order.  So I ended up getting a side of falafel and a falafel hummus wrap.  Just thinking about it, my mouth starts watering.  Another visit here is already being planned!"}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's for an inexpensive, flavorful lunch. The Kibbie plate is a great way to start the meal. The pitzas are worth a try. We thought the chicken was a bit overwhelmed by the ranch, but the hummus pitza was bursting at the seams with flavor. Also, sit in Shannon's section. She knows her stuff - we love her! Logan was the best service experience you could expect - cheerful, excited and cordial. He's usually the manager, but you'll be lucky if he jumps in to help his team at the tables. Amazing cheesecakes - you should most definitely try the baklava one."}
{"text":"If you are used to eating at middle eastern restaurants and frequently eat Lebanese food you will be disappointed by aladdin's. However, if you are simply looking for the American take on these dishes, aladdin's will suffice."}
{"text":"So many dishes to choose from. Tried the jasmine's favorite with chicken. That's a lot of food you just put in front of me. To be tried again."}
{"text":"Good food, weird service. The hummus was fantastic, delicious pickles and veg. The entrees were above average. Our server seemed confused or distracted not attentive at all on a slow night.  Also, on a cold winter night but the AC seemed to be on. We had to eat with our coats on and the cold air blowing on our table didn't help the situation. Overall, we like Aladdin's and we'll be back but perhaps not to this location."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Aladdin's; it is very  good but, like  any store or eatery, can have flaws. One of the flaws I noticed was the lack of checking up on the customer. I was out of water during the appetizer and I didn't  get my cup refilled until she brought the check."}
{"text":"Aladdin's has the best hummus and hot sauce!!  The hummus portion is large enough to enjoy for lunch on its own.  They also have a great salad menu and if you like spicy foods the spicy kafta roll is out of this world!"}
{"text":"I think this place is a decent option for those that want to explore healthier options for eating out. They have a variety of salads, wraps, \"pizzas\" (on pita), and grilled meats.  Their hummus is unbelievably creamy, but the accompanying pita was cold, seemingly from a commercial producer and not made in-house. The meats were a little dry, and felt that I could use a bit more seasoning.  There is a decent amount of seating inside the restaurant and the servers are nice."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Aladdin's in about 7 years.  Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of Mediterranean (or Lebanese) food - I don't hate, it but I don't seek it out.  I came here yesterday with some colleagues from work, and I was very pleased.  I had forgotten how clean and fresh the food is.  The baba ganoush was really good - really tasteful.  I got the beef Shawarma Rolled pita...it was very nicely toasted, and the flavor of the ingredients was great!  I love the yogurt tahini dressing, and the pickles and turnips gave the roll a nice bitterness and crunch.    I may push to have this put in the rotation of oft-visited lunchtime locations."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner with a friend. I got a pita with hummus, tabouleh and vegetables, plus one of their berry smoothies. Food was fresh and filling, but a little bland. I felt like my wrap was missing something but I'm not sure what. The smoothie was tasty and not too heavy or sweet. It's BYOB... always a plus to avoid restaurant wine prices. The wrap and smoothie together were about $10. The prices are on the cheap side but it definitely wasn't reflected in the taste. The waitress was sweet and attentive and didn't mind that my friend and I spent forever catching up before we even got around to looking at the menus.  All together, definitely not a bad choice for cheap, healthy food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat near CMU campus. Highly recommend the Rolled Pitas. The ones I had are the Hummus Falafel, Aladdin's Kabob, Beef Shawarma, and Beef Kafta Rolled. They were all delicious. The rolls come with pickled turnips and greens which gives it a nice sour crunch. I also recommend the Flavor Savor Special. The plate is large and you can get a taste of a variety of things they offer in their rolls. Their smoothies also taste great, although a little small and expensive.  As for desserts, the only thing I tried were the boxed cookies they sell near the register. The pistachio ones are heaven. They're great to buy as a present for a friend :)  Overall love this place. Friendly staff, great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"YUM.  hands down the best hummus and pita/veggie combo around. I got carryout for the first time and they were SPEEDY! my chicken wrap was super yummy and the sauce was AWESOME! i slabbed some hummus & hot sauce which made my taste buds shout with joy :)   over awesome place, cant wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"I like the good in the place a lot  Offers good options for everyone including vegan  Only bad thing is they don't offer any wine neither can you bring any. The ambiance could be nicer too. Need a bit of newer decor and Lightening"}
{"text":"Our family of four came here for dinner once and it turned out to be an amazing place! The vegetarian combo had delicious hummus and baba ghanoush. Interestingly, the grape leaves were warm, which I've never had before. However, they were still citrusy and tangy, and they tasted great! The service was fantastic. Our waitress was kind and helpful, which tied up our great experience here."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for take out desserts for the men in my life... ok, I had some too. I've had lunch here a few times and always admire the dessert case but manage to pass it up. Everyone had a sweet tooth tonight, so I went on a run.   There were a few gluten free choices and a lot of flavor variety. We  aren't gluten free but tried the gluten free cake. It was actually my 14 year olds top choice of the four! It had cherry filling and a fudge icing. The limoncello cake was lite and lemony with a very refreshing, sweet taste. The brownie cheesecake was rich and decedent without being overly sweet. It is heavy enough though to share a piece with someone. The carrot cake was a perfect mix of slightly dense with a nice crumb. It had good spice flavor without dry fruit added. It did have small pieces of walnut but nothing that got in the way of the cake texture. The cream cheese frosting had the perfect amount of sweetness.   When I've eaten in house, I enjoy the house hummus plate and vege plate. I'm not a big fan of some of the other dishes I've tried, but the ingredients are always fresh. The pita does seem on the dry side to me.   There were several pickup orders going out when I was there. They make fresh juices and smoothies also with whole ingredients. I'll have to try one sometime. The restaurant ambience is kind of blah. This seems like an ideal place for healthy takeout dining."}
{"text":"They have fruit smoothie and very delicious chicken. The staff is really attentive and anticipate your needs.  The chicken swarm roles pita is my favorite. The seasoning on all the chicken it always consistent. They also rotate the dessert menu, but the carrot cake is always a good choice."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Aladdin's! I've been coming here for years and everything I've ordered has tasted great! I find myself looking over the menu for a good ten minutes before I can decide what I want because everything awesome! My current go-to's are the lentil soup, Mujadara plate, and the Fattoush salad, but the rolled pitas and the pita pitzas are fantastic options as well! Sometimes, I even order on of the appetizers, such as the Falafel plate or the hummus plate for my entire meal, and its plenty of food. I love to bring my vegetarian friends here because there are so many choices for them! The service here is always really prompt, and the food comes out to your table very soon after you order it!  Another tip: don't miss out on their smoothies (which are made with real fruit and aren't overly sweet!!!) and of course, the CAKES!"}
{"text":"I have been in and out of Aladdin's for years.  The quality of the food is always extremely fresh and tastes great.  Servic e is always expedited.  The restaurant is always very comfortable.  The fare is of course Mediterranean.  Choices are huge for meat eater's as well as the plant powered alike.  Many Vegan and Vegetarian options.  This restaurant is one of the most reliable for quality, taste, and overall experience.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We love Aladdins for quick and easy take out. They have online ordering which makes things so easy. The vegetarian sampler platter with hummus, grape leaves, and falafel and kibbeh are great appetizers. The chicken shawarma wrap with garlic sauce is grilled and delicious. I love the chicken salad- it has almonds and green notion is awesome. The pita breads are really good as well. If you like spicy food get a side of the homemade hot sauce. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The worst shawarma sandwich I ate in my life!!! I got it as a take out along with fattoush, the fattoush was okay, but the shawarma was very bad, I had to through away... I really don't know why people are giving them such good reviews!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My boyfriend and I went here for the first time about a month ago and we've been here probably 5 times since. They have a huge menu, which I appreciated as most middle eastern restaurants I've been too were pretty limited. There's a big section of vegan options too if that's your thing.   Their pita bread is awesome. We always order the hummus to go with it. The first time I went here I ordered the chicken shawarma rolled pita. Such good flavor and was surprised how awesome the chicken was - not at all dry, cooked perfectly.   We will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Two words: Garlic Sauce. It is so good, I may just start ordering sides of it to put on everything I eat.  Since living in Southeast Michigan for a time, I've come to appreciate middle eastern/Lebanese food. So far my favorite item on the menu is the Shishtawook wrap - with grilled chicken, pickles, tomato, turnips, and the almighty garlic sauce. I mean this stuff is lick your fingers good!  The hummus is not as flavorful as I wanted it to be, but its still good. It would be even better with a little lemon juice added. The baba ganoush was, I think, better than the hummus.   The only negative I have run into is the shish kabob - the meat is cooked well done (no pink) so it can be a little dry. It hasn't been too tough or chewy though, and it does have a good flavor. On the other side, the grilled chicken tawook is amazing. Always cooked perfect, never dry and great flavor.  This is my go to place when looking for a garlic fix, that is for sure!"}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a chain I first discovered in Columbus, Ohio. The food is pretty good, on the whole, and the reasonable prices make it a nice fresh alternative to, say, Eat n' Park. The portions are pretty huge and I always leave with leftovers unless all I get is a rolled pita.   They really hawk the health aspects of their food on the menu, which gives me a giggle since I don't think I've ever gone there without tacking a huge piece of cake on to the end of the meal. It is true that the appetizers and entrees are made with fresh ingredients, plenty of veggies, and olive oil -- so the cake doesn't make it entirely a lie.  So what's good here? Everything I've ever tried is at least reasonably tasty, but some items stand out. The almond dressing, first and foremost, makes anything better. I could drink it if it weren't completely unreasonable to do so.  Aladdin's hummus is great. It's a thin, smooth version, topped with olive oil, kalamata olives (just one or two) and cucumber. It's heavy on the tahini, which gives a faint bitter taste that contrasts nicely with the sweetness of the flour in the pita. If you don't like that, you can always try adding a little salt, which also counteracts bitterness.  Speaking of the pita, it's a little hit-or-miss here. I've sometimes gotten baskets of dry, stale pita and sometimes nice warm fresh pita. If you luck into the latter, it's nice and chewy. If the former... well, send it back and ask for fresh instead.  The mujadara is good, but not as deliciously filled with caramelized onion flavor as when I make it at home. Best eaten in the salad pocket pita, then, to add contrast in taste and texture.  One of my favorites is the shawarma hummus plate, which boasts all the above hummus features plus pine nuts and pretty tasty grilled beef strips. It's enormous, though, so plan having it for two meals if you are of average appetite.  My standby, though, is the tuna shawarma rolled (pita). It takes them about 15 minutes to make this; a bit of a wait, but worth it for fresh-grilled tuna. Now, we're still in landlocked Pittsburgh at a casual restaurant, so it's not going to be the best tuna you've ever eaten. It's almost invariably slightly overcooked, but the tahini yogurt dressing remoistens everything. And the pickled turnips lend crunch and tartness.  As for the smoothies, I've only ever had the fresh fruit one, which is mixed up with strawberries, bananas and orange juice. It mostly tastes like strawberries and bananas, and does have some bits of apple or grape skin lingering about, but it's pretty good and almost the same price as a Coke.  And then there are the desserts. If you elect to have dessert, they walk you over to the case to give you a guided tour. I kind of hate that, since I feel like I'm awkwardly blocking the entrance/exit and can't remember the top of the case by the time they reach the bottom. But hey, OK, that's how they roll.  The cake is good. I've been a pastry chef and worked in a bakery, and the cake itself is well-executed. It's light and has a good crumb going on, and since they keep it refrigerated you get a smooth, cool texture that isn't overly sweet by itself. Their mousses are decent, and the ganache is reasonably good, too. Put them all together and you have something rather tasty. I like the peanut butter and chocolate variants they often have, as well as the espresso. Best cake ever? No, but it's better than most.  I've never tried the cheesecake, but want to. Today they had a baklava-topped cheesecake which sounded amazing but also kind of ridiculous. We decided to save it for another visit.  Service is friendly and prompt at this location. The interior is pretty laid back; nothing to write home about, but it's clean and not distracting. With plenty of vegetarian options and health-conscious ingredients (NB: you still have to watch the calories, if you're watching them, since the portions are so large), it's a good place to visit if you need to accommodate varying dietary preferences. Maybe not so much with the low-carb, but who still does that, anyway?"}
{"text":"I have been eating at the restaurant for years! This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants of all time. Staff is very friendly, and the service is great even when it's crowded. I love the Baba Ganoush. Aladdin's Eatery is the only restaurant where I will order this dish. You have to try it. The Tabouli is amazing too, and you should try it with feta cheese. The Shis kabob Salad is a great choice as an entree. When visiting Pittsburgh, this restaurant is definitely a must."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is one of those gem restaurants where you can get a fantastic meal in a casual environment and not feel like absolute crap afterwards. The food is fresh, delicious and usually served with a smile. My go to meal here is the turkey rolled pita, side salad with Aladdin's dressing and an appetizer of hummus. Usually a glass of wine or iced tea (theirs is pretty special) and a slice of cheesecake at the end too. Pretty basic but never disappoints. I love meeting friends here and sitting back to relax and have a nice meal. We take our time, enjoy ourselves and never feel rushed. Truly no complaints here! Two tips: mix the hot sauce in the hummus. And if your feeling extra adventurous throw the garlic sauce in there too. Amazing."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service. Was able to eat on the outdoor patio in the shade. Lamb was good. Cassandra waited on us and made several great recommendations and provided top notch service."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  One of the best Mediterranean meals I have had.  Great service and the food comes quick."}
{"text":"Hummus chicken plate and a honeymooner! After a funfilled Gluttonous, and overindulging weekend of Nachos, Mac n' Cheese, Martinis and hot dogs I needed a break!   The best thing about Aladdin's is that it's not like I have to compromise on taste and turn into a cow chewing some cud. This place has delicious AND healthy selections! When HB asked me to dine I said \"Only if we can eat at Aladdin's my gut needs a hiatus from the unhealthy choices I made all weekend.\"   I have been doing the awesome onesome for quick lunches here for Years! These are my favorites!  The fresh squeezed natural Juices! You can do fruit smoothies or Raw juice combos! I don't drink coffee I opt for Raw Juices, some people get their caffeine fix to give them a boost. I'm already way too hyper so I get my energy kick from the Honeymooner! Carrot, Grape, and Cucumber Juices. I ask for it light on Carrot with an overdose of Cucumber.  For a soupy choice try the Len-Chili, half veggie chili and lentil soup. If you are partial to paring add the Almond salad. Fresh mixed greens, mushrooms, cucumbers, sprouts, roasted almonds! The dressing is also AMAZING, light and yogurty. It has a fantastic flavor.  If in the mood for something a little heavier try the Jaffar's Pitza. It's really good. Veggie chili topped with cheddar cheese and tahini yogurt dressing.  For an Entree hummus is plentiful in the hummus chicken plate, Chicken Mishwi, diced tomato, and parsley. Pita on the side. The chicken is always moist, slighty charred, and smokey but with the bean spread and fresh tomato mix on a pita I feel good about what I am consuming. Everything is always verdant!   Watch Out for the desserts. On my way out I always cover my eyes because the gourmet cakes start pounding on the display case doors asking for a ride to my fridge."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and I'm always satisfied with the food and service. I usually get the Jasmine's Favorite but went with the Flavor Savor today and it was a great combination of tastes. The staff is friendly and well verse on the menu. I also finally tried one of the desserts (carrot cake) and it was delicious. I'd recommend this place any day."}
{"text":"Every Aladdin's location is fantastic food and service and Crocker Park's location maintains the high standard. I have really never had a bad meal at Aladdin's.   I enjoyed a really great lunch of the chicken hummus platter and a side of veggies (with hot sauce of course) by myself this afternoon. The food came out quickly and was delicious. This was a really nice, healthy option on my way back to the office.   My leftovers were boxed up by my server and he included extra pita for me to take home to enjoy the rest of my hummus.   I always walk away from a meal at Aladdin's feeling happy that i dined here."}
{"text":"Overall I really enjoy Aladdin's. As many people have mentioned, plenty of food options for vegetarians and gluten-free eaters. But the meat options are great as well. The Flavor Savor special is a great deal at under $10 for beef, chicken, salad, hummus, falafel, and pita.   My only real complaint is that the service can be a little slow. I suppose this means the food is made fresh which is good, but often the wait seems excessive. However, everyone is very friendly."}
{"text":"Best hummus is town. The chicken chili is great too. Love the hot sauce and they are great with takeout orders.  Pita is always fresh"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner on a Monday evening with my friend.  The first thing you see when you walk in is the case of desserts; they all looked delicious and I had to avert my eyes to stay on my healthy eating goal! The restaurant was buzzing but we didn't have to wait at all to be seated.   Our waitress was very friendly and she had a trainee with her so we received excellent customer service throughout the entire meal; they were consistently checking on us!  We picked Aladdin's to try and satisfy both of our dietary restrictions (Mine is low carbs and my friend is vegan).  After doing some research on the menu, she was very impressed with all of the vegan options (not just salads, but vegan wraps, soups, appetizers, and bowls! They also customized her smoothie order to be vegan which she was very thankful for.   I myself hose the baba ganouj appetizer with vegetable dippers instead of warm pita. It comes in three sizes- small, regular, and large. I got the regular portion since I was getting a light salad entree, and it ended up being about 4 cups of spread which was a lot for me, I took about half home! In hindsight a solo person should probably get the small size as the regular seems to be for sharing!  I also got the Lebanese Salata, a salad of spring mix greens, parsley, cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, and olive oil/lemon juice dressing. It was excellent and also a large portion. I was very happy with it.  As a side note: it is very wet, the remaining salad did not survive for lunch the next day.  One thing I didn't like was how it seems we weren't getting the full picture when ordering.  When I asked for the baba dish with vegetables instead of pita, I was charged for the vegetables as if I just ordered them on the side. The waitress did not mention it would be an up charge. She also asked if I wanted hot sauce on it and did not mention 'would you like to 'add on' hot sauce'? Same goes for my friends salad. She asked if my friend would like a soup or salad with her wrap, and it was extra. But it came off like would you like a choice between a soup or a salad, not would you like to ADD a soup or salad. I mean maybe it was just this particular waitress's way of communicating, but it was confusing. If you aren't sure, definitely ask does this come with a side dish? Is it an up charge to substitute so-and-so? Etc!  I will go back again because it was really awesome that we found a place that, like I said, can work for both of our dietary restrictions! The food was very good and it was an easy walk from the parking garage across the street."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed every meal I have ever had here. The service is always pleasant, the food comes out quickly, and it is always delicious. I am addicted to the Baba, and I crave the Tuna Steak salad. It haunts my dreams. In fact, I think I will get that for lunch today. I honestly could eat here every day. Lots of variety on a large menu.  I dragged my son here. He was all sullen and crabby as a teenager would be to try something new, and foreign. After one bite, he said we can come back any time!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good food, I really like their garlic and spicy sauce. They are great with almost everything.   I frequent this place twice a month and food is always spectacular. The only compliant I have is their Chicken Shawarma Roll, I've definitely had better elsewhere. Overall, their food is great especially the Flavor Savor!"}
{"text":"Ate here last Saturday evening. I enjoyed the baba ganoush, a side of lamb, and the chicken shawarma rolled with a side of garlic sauce (holy garlic....). Great flavor all around. Excellent service by the short dark-haired young lady. She didn't miss a beat."}
{"text":"Ordered for some co workers and I yesterday. Was my first visit. Busy at lunch but that's too be expected.  The falafels are out of this world!!  Now Fridays are falafel Fridays!!"}
{"text":"Great chicken salad rolled as always!.baklava was tasty. Thanks always great prompt service."}
{"text":"Always amazing. Friendly staff, tranquil atmosphere, AWESOME food. The Westlake location is our favorite. Definite must try!"}
{"text":"I don't know what they put in their hummus, but I could drink it, it's so delicious. Add the hot sauce and their pits and it's perfection. The service is always friendly and efficient, with every effort to accommodate a party of any size, even when it's during peak hours. Their soups are amazing, I love the V-9 in particular, as are their salads. With the entire menu being so tasty, it's easy to think you're cheating, but everything is healthy and they have a range of vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options. I get Aladdin's at least once a week and have been doing so for ages. The best!"}
{"text":"I visit the Aladdin restaurant every time I am in town.  Food is fresh and is an healthy alternative to eating out."}
{"text":"Warning: If dining with friends, once plates of food hit the table, grab your choices quickly before your friends gobble up everything. Yes, everything is THAT good at Aladdin's.      We tried a lot of dishes from their new \"simply delicious\" menu. As in, we ordered multiple plates of almost everything on this new menu. Cranberry walnut salad, farmers pizza, and chicken curry pizza. And we must have gobbled up the hummus within 2 minutes of the pita bread and hummus hitting the table. Our server suggested Farrouk's Falafel Pizza as well. So hard to pick my favorite because they were all delicious. But I did eat 2 helpings of the chicken curry pizza. Ok, I also ate 2 helpings of the farmers pizza. And washed it down with a Tropical Storm Smoothie. Sigh.   Should I feel guilty for inhaling all this yummy goodness?  Heck no! Why? Because it's all healthy. Everything is made with fresh veggies, meat and herbs. Who knew eating healthy could taste so good?   I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Always love Aladdin's for it's healthier options. Today I got the Greek chicken salad which is always my go to. I love how all the veggies are chopped up small so it's easier to eat. I only wish they gave you more chicken! The Aladdin's dressing is my favorite and you can buy containers of their dressings to take home!  No matter what you get you have to get the garlic sauce for your pita. It's so good. (However, I've been told that it's basically mayo and garlic) There is an extra fee for it but it's worth it!   Parking can sometimes challenging but that's basically every restaurant in that area. If on street parking is hard to find there's always space in the parking garage on the left."}
{"text":"Tried Aladdin's for the first time for lunch on Saturday. The service, atmosphere, and prices were all good, but not outstanding. However, the food was just so amazing I had to give 5 stars. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after shopping at Ross Park. Aladdin's Falafel Pita was the best falafel wrap I've ever tasted. My picky sister (who typically dislikes everything and was skeptical of the menu) loved the food too. Tyler was an amazing server. Will come back whenever the opportunity arises!"}
{"text":"Two things that bring me back to Aladdin's again and again: the lamb and the garlic sauce. Lamb rolled, lamb salad, the lamb plate. Love 'em all. The garlic sauce is so garlicky it almost burns your tongue...and I love it. If I'm not ordering lamb, I'll get the Greek Pitza, which is kind of like a Greek Salad on top of a crispy pita. The hummus is usually pretty good too, although last time it was lacking flavor. I'm all about tons of garlic and herbs when it comes to hummus, though. Typically service is pretty quick, but I can't say that's been consistent either. The dessert case displays many tempting options, the best one I've had is the carrot cake. Had the coconut cake last week and it was for sure a day or two old. Overall I like Aladdin's because it's a relatively cheap option in Crocker Park and I've never had to wait for a table. And the lamb...mmmm."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before I ordered through DoorDash. Ordered the lamb pita which was overcooked, had 2-3 small pieces of lamb inside, pita was also over toasted. My children's chicken  and cheese pitza also overcooked, falafels overcooked. I'm not sure what happened but I was very disappointed in the food. Flavors was there but execution was horrible."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat.  The Jasmins's Delight with Lamb and garlic sauce is amazing...very lean and flavorful...  They also have great fancy deserts and pretty good Hummus."}
{"text":"Delicious and big serving of Babaganoush.  I've had a lot of their wraps, all deligious.  super cheap.  go here all the time"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat for large groups, especially when some within the group may be vegetarian! The menu has a wide variety of dishes for both vegetarian and \"meatatarians\" alike. They also have freshly blended smoothies and juices as well! I've even stopped by here after a workout just for their \"Tropical Storm\" smoothie.  The food is solid here, and is affordable which is a definite plus! My favorite appetizer to get for a large party of people is the vegetarian combo. The combo allows you to sample hummus, tabouli, baba, falafel (mmmh love falafel!!), and dawali. The portion size is fairly big, and can feed roughly 4-6 fairly well. Usually sharing this and getting a rolled pita fills me. I've tried the hummus falafel roll, and Aladdin's kabob roll. I prefer the falafel roll, because I like my meat a little more tender than the way they prepare it. The kibbie is also a great dish to try! I love the spices mixed in with the meat! Aladdin's also has a long list of cakes for dessert, so if you feel like indulging you just have to walk up to the display case and choose your gratifying treat!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Was my first time eating at Aladdin's. Danielle, our server, was excellent and took great care of us. Mary, the manager was also so nice and awesome to talk to. I had chicken Shawarma and split a hummus plate with a friend, and both were the best I've had since coming to Cleveland! Definitely can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First of all, our waitress was adorable. She was so attentive and sweet and I just really enjoyed our experience, and she was a big part of it. Second of all, the food was great. We ordered the Baba Ganoush and two of the dinner plates along with some baklava for dessert. All the items were made with fresh ingredients and generously portioned. I also LOVED the hot sauce that came alongside the appetizer. We will certainly  be dining here again."}
{"text":"Good middle eastern food, good if you're vegan or veg, good falafel, not great falafel like you'd get in Manhattan on a falafel truck, but good. Prices are a bit extreme. Never had the desserts but the pastry and giant cakes look over the top! Sorry if this review is a little underwhelming, but when I went here the first time I was very excited but I was turned off by the smarmy wait staff who seemed uppity and snooty. I thought the service could have been better, I was not offered water. The food at times can be overspiced. To me, a little cumin goes a long way. The hummus was good, for starters. The falafel sandwich was greasy. The iced tea I ordered was good. This location is right next to Starbucks on McKnight rd."}
{"text":"Delicious! The roasted eggplant dip is scrumptious! I had never been here before, but was only told good things by people who told me to stop in for lunch sometime, and I will definitely be back! I got the Beef Shawarma roll and egg plant dip and I'm excited to try some new things the next time I got! Delicious!"}
{"text":"This was my family's first time here. Great service and great food! We tried their hummus and pita bread, which was fantastic! They have a very large menu! Lots of choices. Good for vegetarian and vegan. I tried the fsiha pita which was spiced beef... Awesome. My wife has the jasmine rice and chicken. The chicken was very tender and tasty. Their hot sauce and tahini yogurt are good too.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! What a find in Mentor, OH!!! I live in CA and would expect a place this authentic, fresh and healthy there, but it was such a refreshing find on a quick visit to OH. Every single item was yummy. We went for lunch with a group of 8, and there was not one item left on any of the plates at the end of our meal.  Is Aladdin coming to Cali?"}
{"text":"As  you may know, if you follow my reviews, my reviews are usually long but today I will make this one short.       Walking into Aladdin's I must admit that I expected more when it came down to the decor but decor comes second to the tasting of the food. I decided to try something different since I've had baba ghanoush and stuffed grape leaves from a food truck in legacy village and it kills me that I don't know that name of that restaurant, but it was delicious!!! So, craving some of that wonderful baba ghanoush, I decided to treat my friend and my boyfriend to dinner at Aladdin's. The service was mediocre, our waitress was friendly but just not caring. I informed her that we were new to the restaurant and instead of walking us through the menu and recommending a dish or an appetizer, she told us that she would give us more time to look over the menu.     The first thing that I noticed on the menu was Baba, but no ghanoush? How different could it be? Well, not so great. My friend on the other hand eats mediterranean food so she was able to vouch for me. We both agreed the the Baba needed some work, it had a bitter taste and a creamy consistency which was not pleasant at all. the Baba was served with pita bread and even that wasn't all the great. the pita bread was too thin and reminded me of two ply tissue. It was served Luke warm, more so closer to cold. She rated it a 7 out of 10 and I rated it a 2 out of 10 because I had so much better than that. I constantly had to wash it down with my tropical storm smoothie.      The Tropical smoothie was nothing special, especially not for over $3, I was better off getting a Coke. The smoothie lacked all the other flavors that it promised, due to the over powering banana water and chunky ice.  On a mintier note, the mint tea was fresh and our waitress kept my boyfriend's cup filled and it was very fragrant and delicious and I don't care for mint teas but that one was good.   I ended up getting the spicy karfta roll, and it was alright. It was a safe choice but it just didn't have that star quality at all. it just lacked a lot in spice and flavor and it wasn't served with a sauce at all, to which my friend used the Baba as her sauce but I didn't dare ruin my meal with that stuff.  It defiantly would have been worth it if it wasn't served on a plate wrapped in foil with no type of appeal to it. Just a rolled up tube on a plate. My boyfriend on the other hand enjoyed his specialty platter which had a little bit of everything on it. He also gotten that lentil soup which was thin and watered down and lacked flavor as well, it also did not look appealing.   I almost forgot, if you love dark beer, they have a wonderful beer called **Atwater vanilla java port**, that was wonderful.   My over all experience, was not so great but the fact that I was able to eat all of my food earned this restaurant an extra star. This place was not for me and if it wasn't for my friend I would never try mediterranean food again but she knows of a Turkish place on Lee Rd. that she thinks is delicious. Be on the look out for that review because I'm going to tell it all."}
{"text":"The V-9 soup is healthy, full of fresh veggies, wonderful broth. The Loubie is amazing...seriously! Any roll you order is great...my favorite is the chicken swarma, but all are fantastic. The prices are very reasonable. Carry out is fast and efficient and dining is is always a pleasure"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and been unimpressed.   This time I tried the flavor saver special and it was actually quite good. It had much more flavor than dishes I've tried previously. At previous visits I've had the shawarma and Kabobs and felt they were bland. The falafel was flavorful and the two meats that come with the dish were tasty as well.   The tropical storm smoothie was fine. Nothing extraordinary though."}
{"text":"My friend and i had originally gone to a diner down the street, but the wait was 40 minutes, so we walked down a block and found this hidden gem...fresh, fabulous Middle Eastern food, scrupulously clean surroundings, wonderful service, and reasonable prices.  My friend and  had the pomegranate mango iced tea, which was wonderful, with endless refills.  The food came quickly. I had the \"Greek Ptizka,\" which was feta cheese, zaatar, diced cucumbers, sliced tomatoes, green peppers, slivered calamata olives and sweet basil baked on a pita.  So yummy! My friend had a SDhishtawook Rolled Pita, containing grilled chicken, turnips, [ickles and Aladdin's \"\"famous garlic sauce.\"  She had homemade baklava for dessert, while I had delicious blueberry cheesecake.  This place has a variety of soups, handmade appetizers, Middle eastern falafels, kaftas, , shish kabobsm kibbie abd other wonderful plates.  The ait staff and manager were all extremely courteous and pleasant.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really fresh Lebanese cuisine at a bargain of a price.  I got the Flavor Savor Special which consisted of grilled Chicken Mishwi and Beef Kafta on a bed of seasoned white rice with vermicelli, served with mixed greens, alongside Hummus and Falafel.  It was a ton of high-quality food at a great price.   Their menu also clearly designates which items are vegetarian, vegan, gluten free or contain nuts."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the hummus and baba :) SO GOOD!! I can't get enough of it."}
{"text":"Call me crazy, but I don't know what the hype is all about. The Aladdin Lamb was decent but the Chicken Curry roll should be renamed \"Honey mustard Chicken Roll with Curry accent\". Hummus or Hommos (however, they spell it) was decent. I'll have to try their dinner to give a more thorough review. As of now it does not get the five or four star from me."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. From the beautiful desserts in the cases as you walk in, to the attentive service, to the slew of selections. Food is served promptly, portions are generous, and taste is sublime. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food. Exceptional service. Nice ambiance. Stopped for lunch. Hummus is to die for! Pita bread is warm and nicely thin. Had the Kibbie platter. Exquisite flavors. Served with mixed-green salad. House dressing is light and full of lemon flavor. I will come back again!"}
{"text":"We came back for round two, this time we both ordered entree salads which were fresh, crisp, and delicious.  The dressings are homemade, light, perfect!  I love the Aladdin's dressing--it's mostly olive oil and lemony.  This time we got dessert which was so, so good.  Neapolitan cheesecake for me and peanut butter mousse cake for the hubby although we ended up sharing...both were awesome! Extra stars!  :D"}
{"text":"It was my first ever visit to Aladdin's Eatery. I was surprised by the quality of the food, the selection of he menu and affordable prices.  I'm not a huge fan of Middle East cuisine but the food tasted well! I think the Aladdin's Eatery is a great option for vegetarians and vegans. Menu had gluten free and vegetarian items.  Also, the place was clean and the server was helpful.  I will comeback."}
{"text":"Excellent !!!!!!!!!! One of my favorite places to dine in Pittsburgh, must try Jasmine's favorite(beef shwarma) and ask for their hot sauce, it's to die for !!!"}
{"text":"Food: 4 Decor: 3 Service: 3  I came here with a group of 6 people for dinner.  1. Flavor Savor Special, 8 (Our grilled Chicken Mishwi and Beef Kafta on a bed of seasoned white rice with vermicelli. Served with a mixed greens salad topped with Lebanese Salata, along side Hummos and Falaffel. Pita on the side.) Pretty good. Everything was quite good, and there wasn't anything I really didn't like. The beef kafta is basically sausage. Hummus was pretty good, and the falaffel was yummy.  Would probably come here again if I'm in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a great place to grab a light lunch or dinner. Terrific food that became so popular it turned into a chain.  This is one of the original locations, and I remember having my first indian food experience growing up in lakewood here.  Fantastic food, service, timing and decor."}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong with the place, service is good & food is great. I can always count on this place for a clean meal."}
{"text":"I stopped here with my girlfriend on Mother's day where they had a special with an appetizer, entree, and cake for $13 per person. This was my first time at a Mediterranean restaurant, and our waiter was more than happy to go through the menu with suggestions and what was inside each dish. The hummus was one of the best hummus I have ever had, and the falafels were crunchy and moist. I ordered the beef shawarma and my girlfriend ordered the Aladdin's favorite combo. Both our entrees were delicious and I highly recommend them. One tip is to ask for the Dijon mustard; I don't know what they put in it, but the sauce was a magical experience on anything we dipped into it. I would come back just for their Dijon mustard.   One slight complaint was that the food did take a bit of time to come out, but that was understandable because it was around 1 PM on Mother's day when we dined.  Overall, I highly recommend Aladdin's if you are ever around the area. I think this place is a much better value than a certain restaurant across the street and the food is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Love the vegetarian chili, hummus, and so many things in the menu.  The children's menu is healthy and they like the smoothies. I have eaten at the Westlake store several times and it never disappoints. Desserts are tasty and so are the smoothies."}
{"text":"So, my friend and I went for lunch today and everything was truly delicious.  Our server,  Matt (I believe that was his name), was attentive and thoughtful.  The falafels  were so wonderful and the vegetarian chili was spicy and satisfying.  The spinach pie was very good . The tiramisu was amazing and light. Rula, the manager was so gracious. I will definitely be back with my husband!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, we had a sampler appetizer plate which was delicious and my lamb wrap was quite tasty. Quick friendly service, quite inexpensive,  though the waitress seemed thrown when we paid cash. Took forever to get the change...I would definitely go back though"}
{"text":"Aladdin's is an amazing local restaurant chain, and I was excited to finally introduce the restaurant to my husband! We've been here twice recently, and unfortunately, I must admit that our experiences were pretty different.  Food: Aladdin's food is excellent, particularly for the price. Getting an appetizer is a must, and I usually order the hummus. I'm not a hot sauce fan, but trust me, order some of their hot sauce and add a bit (to taste) to the hummus. It will blow your mind! I've also had the tabouli here before and would highly recommend it, too. In addition to the appetizers, I have enjoyed the rolled pitas (particularly the Aladdin's kabob and the chicken shawarma). The rolled pitas come packed full of meat and veggies, and I believe are a great value for the price. I also tried Farrouk's falafel pitza and was a bit disappointed. I didn't love the flavors or the thin, toasted pita crust and wish I had ordered one of the rolled pitas instead.  Service: The first time that my husband and I came here, service was phenomenal. Our food was delivered promptly, and our female waitress (not sure of her name, but she has a very sweet, high voice) was amazing! However, the second time we've been here, we were very disappointed in our service. It was extremely slow and seemed to be because of our male college-student aged waiter. The table next to us arrived and ordered after we did but finished eating when we had just received our food. Our waiter was MIA for long periods of time during our meal, including not refilling drinks promptly and taking a very long time to deliver our tabouli appetizer (which I can't imagine took the kitchen more than 3 minutes to make and plate).  Overall, Aladdin's is a great restaurant. However, I am definitely going to pause before coming here again to make sure that I have plenty of time available for a meal that could potentially take a very long time to be served..."}
{"text":"Best falafel I've had in a long time! Nice little restaurant, variety of food options (and tempting desserts), and friendly service. I will be back for more!  Side note: they could pick some better music; it's not an elevator... but really the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"We had Aladdin's catered for a large get-together of approximately 30 people. The hosts ordered pita, hummus, baba ganoush, salad, and a variety of wraps. I was impressed by how large the portions were, but that the quality was still so high. Everything was seasoned very well, and I could tell everything was freshly-made.   Would love to visit in-store sometime soon!"}
{"text":"First time and loved it ...the Chicken Sambusek appetizer was fantastic ...the Aladdin's Favorite Combo was great too ...will definitely be trying again"}
{"text":"There are so many good things about the concept of Aladdin's. I love Mediterranean food. I love that they have a lot of choices for vegetarians. I love that they are sensitive to food restrictions and clearly label things to that end on their menu. I love that they have healthier options if you want to go out to eat but not kill your waistline.   But unfortunately, the thing I need to love the most about Aladdin's -- the actual food -- was just not all that impressive during my visit. I ordered the Jasmine Favorite dinner with chicken. The medley of beans, veggies, and rice that sounded tantalizing from the menu description was bland and devoid of the promised seasoning. The bits of veggies looked and tasted as though they came straight from a freezer bag. And the chicken tawook adorning the top of the dish was tough, flavorless, and had an oily coating of what tasted like Sysco-type industrial cooking spray. The dish just didn't taste all that fresh (or all that Mediterranean, frankly).   They have a huge menu, so perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing or went on an off night. I do like the concept, so I may go back again and try something else. But for now, I can't give my very average meal any more than 3 very average stars."}
{"text":"I feel like I should be embarrassed that I practically have the menu at Alladin's memorized and eat there at least once a week (my excuse is that it's very close to my homestead and on the way to work). However, I can't be that embarrassed because the food is so good. if you're in a rush, they're typically pretty quick too.  The hummus is great. I can make hummus at home for cheap, but Alladin's is so good that it's difficult for me to even bother opening a can of chickpeas. Plus, the hot sauce that they have (I just mix it in to the hummus - SO GOOD) is fantastic. I need buy a bottle of it.   The menu is pretty huge, and I feel like they have good options for almost anyone. I have friends with diverse tastes and food needs (allergies, etc) and Alladin's is one of the few places that I can pick up food for almost anyone at, or even just meet up. The servers are all excellent - I have yet to have a poor service experience there. The food is always fantastic and the servers are polite and helpful; they're there just when you need them and if you feel chatty, I've had servers almost pull up a chair.   I've been to other locations (Hudson and Lakewood the most) but Independence is large, centrally located, and most important - less than a mile from me! If I'm home and not wanting to cook, I know i can have food in under 20 minutes that will also be healthy and mostly fresh (if not totally). If you have any diet restrictions, they're really great and accommodating."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is great for a quick lunch or dinner.  I love the vegetarian-friendly menu, the extensive list of appetizers, and the generous glasses of wine!  I always get the humos and pita, usually followed by a wrap or pitza.  Last  time I had the falafel pitza, which was absolutely delicious.   Service was great, portions are reasonable for the price, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is just a solid restaurant. The menu is extensive, it's quick, the wait staff is friendly, and I am never disappointed with my meal. They use very fresh, high quality ingredients. Their baba ganouj and falafel are some of the best I've tried! The falafel is perfectly crispy and fresh, not overdone. I often go here for takeout because they are so quick and reliable. If I do takeout I usually get a rolled pita with hummus or baba and tabouli. My parents love this place as well. My only slight complaint is that sometimes it is a little cold with the AC, but I just have to remember to take a sweater and then I'm fine. The outside seating is also very nice on a summer day!"}
{"text":"Very very good food at cheap prices! Has good ambience, excellent service and a good selection of dishes too! I'm a sucker for all their dishes with the Dijon mustard, it adds a whole new taste to their food!! While the pizza-on-pita is good, they're a letdown as compared to some of the other dishes they serve."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place. Stopped in for a quick lunch on a Monday. The fatayer plate was delicious with fresh greens and cucumbers. The stuffed pita was hot and delicious. Aladdin's special dressing was a little too strong for me, but I'm sure those who like olives will love it. The service was excellent and the ambiance was very nice. It took about 7 minutes for my food to arrive after the order and I walked out with a healthy meal. Definitely going back to this place to try a different dish on their big menu. Their parking is in the rear so don't miss it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The prices really aren't bad at all and they will actually give you free pita to take home with your hummus (since you probably can't finish all of it). The portions are also pretty substantial and it seems like an accessible way to try a more specific type of food. Get the flavor savor special plate - both the chicken and beef are amazing and you'll get even more hummus!"}
{"text":"Aladdin's is my go-to for a relaxing, quick, and HEALTHY lunch or dinner! The always fresh middle eastern cuisine is refreshing in a world filled with fried foods. They offer various vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. However stay clear if you are allergic to nuts and lentils.  I highly recommend the staples (hummus, tabouli, chili, and falafel) and the Aladdins Chicken Pitza- pita flatbread with chicken, green peppers, and scallions on a sweet honey mustard sauce. Yummy for adults but also a LOVE for kids. Don't forget the HUGE sweets that they have on display for dessert. If the portions are too huge, definitely get the smaller but equally as delicious diamond baklava.  Staff is friendly and helpful when making decisions. I usually don't want longer than 15/20 minutes for food. I will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Oh, Allandin's! I heart you a lot. Everything about you is  delicious. My date and I were in need of a late afternoon nosh and stopped in for some yummy goodness. We enjoyed the hummus served with a generous portion of pita, followed by the spicy kafta rolled pita. The spicy kafta is pure enjoyment - it is a sad moment when you near the end. The food is always fresh and service is pretty good, too. If you're in the mood for dessert, they have an awesome selection of sweets that will satisfy nearly anyone."}
{"text":"I love Aladdins. Every time i visit Cleveland, i must stop to get their chicken salad pockets, it's one of the best!! Food here is pretty tasty and love their smoothies"}
{"text":"This place was good... All the food was fresh and a fast served ! The vegan appetizer platter was my fave! And had the taste of true middle Eastern food! I have truly grow a love for this place !"}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's!! I try to stop in as often as I can when in the area with my partner. I have been to this location over a handful of times and have always had a great experience. Have stopped by the Mt. Lebanon location a few times, but more impressed with the wait staff at the Canonsburg location. Great atmosphere and plenty of menu choices!"}
{"text":"Aladdin's is one of my favorite restaurants and a great fallback when there's no where else I want to go. Don't let the Lebanese/Middle Eastern/Mediterranean label scare you- Aladdin's has something for everyone. First off, everything at Aladdin's is fresh and delicious. I've never had anything there that wasn't made well or seemed to come from a box. The lettuce is always crispy, the meats fresh and juicy, and I love their pita. Plus, with so many vegetarian dishes on the menu, I doubt there will be too many people that can find a fault with Aladdin's. My favorite thing to get on the menu is the Flavor Savor Plate. It has a bunch of the best from Aladdin's, with Chicken Mishwi, Beef Kafta, rice, salad, hummos, and Falaffel (mmm... Falaffel). They also have a dozen other plates with all kinds of chicken, lamb, beef, and other combinations that will make your head spin, but if you have no idea what to order, get the Flavor Savor and you'll get a little bit of the best on the menu- plus at $9.95, you can't beat the price and will probably have leftovers. Aladdin's also has these amazing stuffed pitas. They take fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and onions, and overstuff them into a pita pocket. Then, they put a meat on it, a choice of feta or cheddar cheese, and dressing. These things are huge, and my favorite is the tuna pocket. The tuna is big chunks of tuna steak that is cubed and grilled with seasonings- yum. I've also tried several of their pita pizzas, which have a crispy pita base and lots of choices on toppings. There also wraps, rolls, cheese pies, stuffed grape leaves, and lots more- the menu will make your head spin. For an appetizer, you can't go wrong with their hummos. Finally, make sure you leave room for dessert. Despite their Middle Eastern menu, they have very Americanized desserts that are freaking awesome. You can't miss them when you walk in- they're in a case at the front entrance. These monster cakes are incredible, and could have anything from double chocolate cake, to red velvet cake, carrot cake, or lots of others. The cakes are huge, and the portions are giant. Many times, I come here just for dessert. They also usually have two or three different kinds of baklava, which are moist and sweet and better then my grandmother's (sorry Nene). Are you still reading?? Why haven't you headed over to Aladdin's yet? Don't worry, the place is casual, so you don't even have to dress up, and you'll want to bring a friend because the portions are big and you'll want to share. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This review is dedicated to one of my friend in CMU.The only spot which comes to his mind when i said food is Aladdin.I was never a great fan of this place until my last Pittsburgh trip.    The place is located close to Squirrel hill where i have my other favorite eat outs.For some reason i craved for hummus and decided to go here for brunch.As you enter you may be thrown off looking at those huge yummy cakes .I generally lose my appetite entering the place.Mr.Aladdin please change the location for your cakes,but i have heard they are amazing( i am going to save it for my next trip).    We ordered a Falafel salad,Pita strips with hummus and a Falafel wrap.I must say it was great.It totally satisfied my hummus craving and it kinda filled me up.    The place is kind of tiny but i am sure they would soon start a street called Aladdin's eatery;it is packed most of the time. the service is friendly and quick. And yes this was the place where i tried Middle Eastern food the first time *Spirals in front of me* I am not dizzy,it is a flashback for where i was 3 years back :)    -Smriti"}
{"text":"I really like Aladdin's. Mediterranean food is my jam and the east side suburbs (or really, maybe most of NEO?) is in short supply of it. Add them to the list of places you can eat fresh, colorful food without feeling like Violet in Willy Wonka when she blows up like the blueberry.  I'm a sucker for the hummus shawarma and their house green tea. They have great shawarma in general and it's spiced well. This location is pretty quiet and chill. On my most recent visit, I watched the patient staff deal with a totally outrageous dine-in customer that was rattling off all the things she currently couldn't eat on her very trendy diet. They were really calm and actually had ideas from the menu. I probably would've started breathing fire and roared at her to leave. Awesome staff.  I don't have too many other groundbreaking observations about Aladdin's. Its inexpensive, vegetarian/vegan/allergy friendly and full of delicious menu items. It's a solid standby when I'm in the area visiting nearby St. Vincent's."}
{"text":"I adore this place. The hummus is creamy, their pita is perfectly spongy, and their chicken pita pitza is a must have. I haven't ever tried their falafel but I've heard rave reviews about it from people I've dived with there. Atmosphere and service is good in all locations."}
{"text":"Great place.  This chain branch is a welcome contribution to the North Hills.    PROS: Menu has been standard for a number of years, but it's always a great selection of healthy options.   CONS: wait-staff is hit or miss: much unlike the branch in Squirrel Hill or Cranberry, I find myself hunting down the waiter in this location more than any other.  Sometimes they are great, sometimes they are \"out to lunch\""}
{"text":"Aladdin's offers a wide range of Mediterranean dishes with many different combinations.  They've got a good mix of somewhat healthy stuff as well as some rich goods to satisfy any appetite.  I'm really picky about falafel and consider it as a make or break for many restaurants.  Aladdin's definitely passed the test as theirs was a great combination of fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  The flavor wasn't too overwhelming with just a hint of bitterness.  Their lamb rolled wrap is decent but the onion was a little overwhelming.  It had more of a fast food taste and feel to it than a restaurant entree.  My friend ordered one of their \"pitzas\" which was essentially an open-faced pita with a \"thin crust\" pizza feel.  I would highly recommend Aladdin's for both restaurant dining and takeout.  When you're hungry, their food really hits the spot."}
{"text":"Love the food and desserts! Sometimes the service is a bit slow, but the food is a 5/5. The smoothies are very good and are the fresh pressed juices."}
{"text":"I've always loved Aladdin's and have been to several northeast Ohio locations. The Portage Trl location in Cuyahoga Falls didn't disappoint. I was there between lunch and dinner on 5/25/15. The servers and manager were busy but attentive.  I enjoy Aladdin's because the menu is varied and satisfies over and over, and this location proved to me the staff here today back up that experience. Looking forward to coming back soon. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped here during a shopping visit with a friend and was pleasantly surprised. The blah strip mall setting defies the pleasant, warm decor inside. It's actually a date-worthy restaurant. Our server was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He checked on us often, refilled our drinks promptly, and brought the check quickly.  We started with baba gannoush which was perfect, although I wish restaurants like these would give you an upgrade from the standard 1000-in-a-pack plain pita to go with it. The portion was plenty for 2-4 people to share.  I had the Jasmine's Favorite rice with chicken tawook. Sooo impressed with this dish. The blend of beans, chickpeas, carrots, onions, potatoes, and other veggies and spices was spot on and the portion size was generous enough to take home a lunch-sized portion for later.  This will definitely be added to my list of places to frequent at Waterworks."}
{"text":"Place to go for Mediterranean hummus, meat, falafel and more. Has gluten free, vegan and vegetarian options! Got to try their specialty plates - lots of freshly made hummus! Casual and reasonably priced. Polite servers."}
{"text":"Finally made it out to Aladdins after wanting to try it for a bit. My sister and I went for lunch, and it wasn't busy which was nice. We got the Tabloui as an appetizer, which was great. I was worried it wouldn't be big enough but it was a good size for us to split. It tasted really for fresh which was exactly what we needed for an appetizer. They also bring Pita out to the table, which was pretty average.  I got the lamb rolled pita as my lunch meal, and it was so good. Some of the sauces ran a little thin, so they tend to spill out, but the flavor was not lacking at all, and I can't wait to go back and try something ekse"}
{"text":"The best of the Aladdin's I've been to. The interior decor is pristine & feels classy; the service is friendly & helpful. I almost always get the same thing: the Aladdin's chicken pitza, which isn't even Middle Eastern! But? It's delicious, especially the honey Dijon sauce base.  Their hummus - with their special hot sauce on the side - is an appetizer must. They've also got great vegetarian chili & really soothing tea.  Go to Aladdin's. Be happy."}
{"text":"I'm thankful to have an Aladdin's much closer to home so I no longer have to shlep out to Hudson for some of my favorite Mediterranean & Middle Eastern dishes!  This location opened opened at Portage Crossing in the spring to little fanfare (I hadn't heard they were open) but big business (it's been either full or at least very busy every time I've stopped in). Since their opening, I've been in a handful of times, & though the service was a little rocky to start (& though a few of the employees are less than friendly), it's since shaped up. Servers are typically on the ball & attentive, getting orders correct, explaining specials, & coming around with regular refills.  The space is small but accommodating, with a few booths & some smaller tables for two. It's in a corner location, so two of its walls are windows, giving it a bright & inviting atmosphere. And the food... oh, the food. I've been to a few Aladdin's locations (lookin' at you, Youngstown) that are less than delicious, & I was worried that this one would follow suit. I'm so pleased to find that it's instead following in the Hudson location's footsteps by being pretty spot-on.  I LOVE their pitzas (they spell it that way, I'm not just an idiot), which are flatbreads made on their thin pita bread. Try the Aladdin's chicken pizza, made with sweet honey dijon & tangy garlic sauce, or the new curried chicken pitza, with peas & banana peppers. Want something a little bit lighter? Their hummus is to die for (get a side of hot sauce to mix in!), & their chili is hearty & filling but somehow still light. They also serve healthy fruit smoothies & raw veggie juice for days when you need an extra dose of energy.   I'm excited to see one of my favorite chains makes its way to Cuyahoga Falls, & I hope its new location here will open local folks' minds (& tastes!) to Middle Eastern food. Unsure of the menu or unfamiliar with the terminology? Ask the staff to explain, & they'll be happy to help you find something that suits your tastes. It took me a few tries to find the items I like most, but now I'm obsessed!   Welcome to CF, Aladdin's. You'll be seeing a lot of me."}
{"text":"Have frequented Aladdin's many times both for dine in and take out. Have never had a bad experience. Known for their Lebanese/Middle Eastern food like hummus and falafel, don't pass on desert. Service has always been great and prices are fair. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The Flavor Saver (real title) is a great intro to this restaurant and it is under $11.  This place is a fine Middle Eastern restaurant. Tables fit for four people, clean restrooms, well lit but not too bright, pleasant staff. The decor is a little bland but nice.  My friend and host recommends the iced tea.  Not much makes this place special or unique but the food was tasty."}
{"text":"So many delicious vegan options! Everything was outrageously good. We got the sampler appetizer, and Jasmine's favorite rice dish. Off the charts good. High ingredients. Very fresh. Our server was knowledgeable and very helpful. Can't wait to go back. The hummus was indescribably yummy and the falafel was to die for. Also, probably best hot sauce we've had ever. If you're looking for a greasy, fattening meal, go somewhere else. If you want to eat interesting flavors and feel good after, give it a try. It's even BYOB!"}
{"text":"Solid mediterranean food. Place is located on a cool strip in squirrel hill. The host who sat us was a bit rude, but about the only complaint I have about this place. I had the Dawali and Savor flavor (beef kafta, falafel, and chicken). Dawali is great. If you haven't heard or tried it, it's great; essentially has chickpeas, rice and a few other things that are wrapped in a grape leaf. Definitely eat it with the pita for the full taste. I was really impressed by how well the meat was cook. The chicken is just done enough so it is soft and tender, you can literally part it with a fork and  the beef kafta is nice and chewy. This dish comes with salad, rice and hummus as well so you get a bit of everything. Service was quick, food out within 15-20 minutes, and quite a bit of seating is available (you wouldn't be able to tell by seeing the front of the store). They also have great desserts like cheesecake (whaaaaat, a mediterranean place has cheesecake? yup). Overall, great place, and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a funny restaurant.  I've eaten in probably four or five of their locations around Cleveland, and everyone is different.  Some are terrible, with bad food and bad service (like the one in Hudson).  Others are terrific.  Luckily, this is one of the better ones.  It looks like a newer location and the interior is nice looking.  Our server was terrific, very attentive, very friendly, as was the other staff.  All of our food was excellent.  And they even had tastes of their version of \"Lady Fingers\" as freebies, for dessert.  I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Never.   I've been here numerous times. I've recently taken on a more vegan lifestyle so this place calls to me in so many ways. The tremendous amount of options for this lifestyle is so convenient.  The hummus is amazing. Their sauces are perfect. The baba ganoush is so far beyond any other I've had.   I usually get the mujadara power salad because it has everything I want, and on top of everything, vegan.   I want to explain a certain situation that will make me a forever customer.  My fiance's parents and grandmother were in town last weekend, and at the last minute, we decided to get Aladdin's Eatery for dinner. I called ahead of time and let them know there would be 5 people there within the next 20 minutes to have dinner. They were so helpful on the phone and said they would have a table ready. My fiance's grandmother is not very quick on her feet, and her walking is minimal. We arrive and I let them know we are here. The lady at the front counter let us know they already had a table upstairs for us, but that they would accommodate a seat on the 1st level. What a great gesture, and great customer service. They got the table ready in T-minus 1 minute, and we had food within 10 minutes.   Really, the help is great. The food is great. This experience alone will make me a loyal customer. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"After being deployed to the middle east, I can tell you this menu is pretty authentic.  I make some pretty good humus, but this place is GREAT...  Get any meal with this key component and meat and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Consistently good food in a sterilized environment comfortable enough for midwestern old folk from bfe."}
{"text":"Always have a great experience at the Fox Chapel location. My menu favorites are the falafel either as an appetizer or in the rolled pita, the hummus, greek chicken salad, lentil soup, ugh so many great things! Never disappointed with the food. THEIR HOT SAUCE IS ICONIC! Service is so so."}
{"text":"Really like Aladdin's! Healthy and delicious options. I usually order for lunch. They have an easy online ordering option which is so convenient. I have had the Aladdin's salad, the baba gannouj, and the Louie plate. All have been so good! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Because of Aladdin's, I'm going to try other Lebanese food joints around Cleveland. It is all new to me but it is great! Walking into Aladdin's I was happy to see a Yelp sticker on the front door. We sat quickly and were ordering drinks and hummus within minutes. The hot sauce is perfect and probably the best part of Aladdin's. The hummus app was easily shared and enjoyed by four. Our entrees came shortly after this and I had ordered a Lamb rolled pita. The meat was tougher than I expected but had no problem finishing it, thanks again to the hot sauce. It was quick, it was delicious, staff was friendly, and I'm sure to return!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian choices. Dawali are a favorite and of course hummos. The pita pizzas are great, wraps are great. This location seems to have pretty good service compared to other locations I've been to. They have a healthy kids menu which is nice. My daughter likes the kafta and rice and pita bread."}
{"text":"Food was great and flavorful. Pricing was excellent. Service was great with a smile and attentive but not annoying."}
{"text":"This place is geared towards health conscious diners.  I wasn't a big fan of their take on beef shawarma, it seems more like beef stir fry in a pita.  That said, the pita was very good and overall I enjoyed the flavor.  Also had the hummus which was a refreshing appetizer."}
{"text":"Not bad, but... seemed a bit expensive for what we actually got. We both got pita wraps, and they were served unceremoniously wrapped in foil on a plate with no sides. The wraps weren't very thick (which can be nice because the proportions of ingredients are better that way), but with no sides it felt like a light lunch for the price. I liked the flavors (pickles were great), but it wouldn't kill ya to give us some French fries or something!"}
{"text":"What can I say, other then that this place was a surprise to my husband and I. We never really knew what to expect from this place or had and big interest in trying it out, until this one evening. We spontaneously decided to give it a shot and we are very happy we did. I was very pleased with the food options, as they were mostly very healthy and very affordable.    Most of the dishes we never heard of before, but our server was very informative and gave great advice on what we should try for our first time here. The app we had chosen was their vegetarian combo. Included in this was wrapped grape leaves. I have never been a big fan of this, but theirs was very good. Their pita bread and hummus was very yummy as well. I had also ordered their vegi soup, which of very filling and had a great variety of vegis in it, including garbanzo beans and potatoes. We had ordered two entrees. One was the Aladdin pitza, which was very good, and we ordered the Lebanese vegi dish that was served on top of a rice. I was honestly so full after the app and soup that the entrees made it home for a second meal. not complaining about that!   If your one for gluten free and vegetarian options, then this will be the place for you! I was so full leaving here, but did not feel at all guilty about it. The service was very good. The restaurant is set in a great location, right on Washington road. They have 2 parking garages near by if there is no parking on the street. And their deserts... They have so many! Cheesecakes, Cakes, and few other options as well. I usually write EVERYTHING down about the menus and what is in the dishes, but my mind got away from me this evening. I know they have take out. They are also kid friendly as well, with a nice menu for them. The bathroom is a little strange though (two toilets, no stalls). The restaurant itself is nice, but casual. Reminds me a little bit of a panara bread decor, but with touches of Lebanese. They have glass panels to separate every few tables to give a feeling of intimacy and not a cafe feel. We will be back here again for sure!"}
{"text":"I've gone to Aladdin's probably five times now and they have been amazing every time. The food is fantastic, and the service is even better. Today I ordered takeout and remembered after making the call that one of my guests is deathly allergic to tree nuts. I asked if that would be a problem and the hostess went out of her way to ensure that the kitchen had changed their gloves and that the pita bread bag had been unopened to avoid cross contamination. It was just one of many fantastic experiences."}
{"text":"I always forget about Aladdin's and I don't know why because, each and every time I eat at one, it's just so dang yummy! My bf is not from Pittsburgh and was visiting this weekend and our major destination was the new Trader Joe's in the North hills (review ill come later). It was about 2:00pm Sunday and we hadn't eaten yet and were famished. After racking my brain for good options in the North Hills, I remembered Aladdin's, so off we went! When we arrived there were 2 or 3 other tables in the restaurant and we were quickly sat and greeted by our server. We each got a water and I also ordered a \"constant comment\" hot tea. Our server brought those quickly and since their menu is HUGE (although I always end up ordering the same thing), we still needed some more time to look everything over. Our patient server came back within a few minutes and I ordered my usual the chicken shawarma rolled (Marinated char-grilled chicken with tomato and onion topped with Tahini Yogurt dressing, rolled in a pita) and my bf ordered the Arayiss Pitza ( Hummus serves as a base and it's topped with seasoned ground meat, diced tomato, pine nuts and garnished with chopped parsley). I'm always amazed by the size of the chicken shawarma-it's huge and leaves you feeling full but not overly stuffed. And it's relatively healthy to boot! I gave a piece to the bf and he agreed that it is awesomely delicious! He really enjoyed his pitza-basically it's a flat pita personal pizza- and also noted that he was full but not overly stuffed after consuming the entire dish. I tried a bite-mostly because I've always wanted to try their pitzas but habitually order the same chicken shawarma regardless-and it was very tasty! I really liked the addition of the pine nuts for that added crunch. Best of all, this delicious meal came to $17.50 for the both of us! Yummy food at a great price point....we will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday evening for some gluten free take-out. The food is awesome. Tender fresh tasting chicken mishwi with vegetables and rice and a side of creamy flavorful hummus with carrots and celery. Staff were extremely friendly and attentive and helpful with my dietary needs. I will definitely return when in town.   Months later: Came in again with family (mother, brother, husband and young adult kids). Service was beyond excellent. We were in a time crunch. Our server was responsive and super friendly and handled multiple \"could you do\" requests. We were given extra pita to take with our leftovers on our way out -- without asking. This restaurant is a repeat winner for us. So many attentive smiles by the servers even with a busy crowd."}
{"text":"Love this place for an inexpensive healthy option when I don't feel like cooking. The best place to come to if you're a vegan or vegetarian and looking for options besides the typical salad or frozen veggie burger.   We always start with the hummus and their house made hot sauce...SO good. The pita is endless, but f you're looking to cut some calories, try the veggies. Always fresh and they give you a nice variety.  We always tend to have a different server when we come here, so I have a feeling there's a high turnover rate. Even so, we always receive friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to on a regular basis. Service is always fast and food is amazing. My favorite things include Aladdin's Chicken Pitza, chicken shistawook roll and the spicy Kafka roll!"}
{"text":"Came on a quiet night during the holidays and was pleasantly surprised by the food and prices. We got the large humus appetizer which met expectations. For my entree, I got the curry chicken pitza which was sweeter than expected and was reminicent of Chick-fil-A sauce tanginess. The only thing that was a disappointment was the hot tell which was nothing more than a tea bag and a personal small hot water kettle. Service was average and prices were cheap."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I frequent so often that I never really thought about reviewing it.  They have a very nice deal for their \"Flavor Savor\" platter (not on their menu online) which consists of falafel, beef kafta, chicken, salad, and rice.  My girlfriend usually gets a chicken pitza or a beef kafta roll - both are very tasty as well.  She also really likes the cookies.  We've eaten in and taken out and we've always been treated well. They also always let us take home extra pita bread."}
{"text":"Good food - too many gnats.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff was personable and friendly."}
{"text":"The food was very good. 4 star worthy for sure, possibly 5. I got a lentil dish that was super tasty. Fresh veggies. And a very cool menu which I appreciated as a vegan. The fifth star has to be reserved for outstanding service. My server was not only friendly but went out of her way to make me feel welcome. It's pretty rare I gush on service -I'm a former server and my standards are high. This was really past excellent. Thank you Olivia!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Aladdin's and we had such a good experience! The standout, from the minute we walked in, was the amazing service.   The hostess was so nice about us wanting a table outside then changing our mind. And our waitress Katie K was so friendly and on top of things! I could hear her checking on our appetizer when it was taking too long and she had great beer and food recommendations for us first-timers. Seriously the best service we've had at a restaurant in a long time!   The food was great and reasonably priced too. Try the veggie sampler appetizer, it was awesome."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a franchise with almost 30 locations in a few different states.  Still, as evidenced by all the accolades on the wall, the food is better than what you'd expect from a chain.  My boyfriend grew up eating at Aladdin's in Cleveland with his family, so he was excited to have a location near our apartment in Pittsburgh.  He came home the other day raving about their spicy kafta rolled pita, so when we needed a quick dinner on Saturday night, we decided to turn to them for takeout.  They have very convenient online ordering, which was great, and there is no fee for it.  You get a free hummus with your first online order, so that was delightful.  The only thing to remember is that after your first online order, you have to call the restaurant and confirm it - you just need to do it the first time, I guess so they can make sure you are a real person or something.  They told us to be there to pick up the food in 20.  We were there on time and our food was ready.  We had our free hummus, some falafel, a lentil soup, the chicken sambusek, and the Mediterranean lamb.  We were hungry, as you can see.  Everything was clearly well-made and very flavorful - the only downside was that none of it was....warm.  I think the food might've been ready about 10 minutes before we picked it up.  So I guess I'd wish they'd been a little more accurate in their estimate of how long the food would take to cook.  Besides the temperature, the food was really tasty.  The falafel had great flavor, though it wasn't quite as soft on the inside and crispy on the outside as I'd have liked (Sababa's falafel is still my ideal!)  The lentil soup was very mild, but restorative.  It was so fresh, light, and lovely.  My boyfriend wasn't a big fan of the hummus - I'm not sure what it was that bothered him, maybe the stronger tahini taste?  I thought it was fine though.  The chicken samusek was really interesting - flavorful, almost smoky chicken wrapped in a pita.  The lamb was delicious also, served over the most lovely cinnamon rice.  But again, the temperature - it affected the taste and the texture of the meat.  Sigh.  I really think this is a 4-star place, we just had a 3-star experience this one time.  I'm sure we'll order from there again and maybe we'll show up early to pick up our food, or dine-in!"}
{"text":"One if the best things about Aladdin's was the fact that their menu specifically marked out which items were Gluten Free, Vegan, or vegetarian . This made it easy to navigate the menu.   The food was ok and the portion was huge, but I've paid cheaper for the same amount of food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Aladdin's deserves 10 stars, seriously! No matter which location you eat at, you will have a consistently fabulous experience. The food is incredibly tasty and there are so many healthy options, too, as well as vegan choices that are impressive. My favorite soup is the V9 -- make sure to order a side of hot sauce, if a little heat blows your hair back. I've loved all of the wraps and salads that I've tried, but by far my fave salad is the Taza chicken. So interesting that they mixed in squash, grapes, zucchini and tomatoes - never, would I have attempted that but they pull it off and it is GOOOOOOD. I also love the lentil soup and the hummus. Bottom line: no matter what you eat, you will leave full and happy :)"}
{"text":"Terrible experience! I walked in to have a meal at 9:20 and I was warned by the waitress the kitchen would be closing at 10:00 PM. I could tell they were trying to shut the place down early. There was no need for her to warn me 40 minutes ahead of time. I just walked out and informed her of her inability to properly serve."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh, cheap, and healthy. Located in the heart of the Sq. Hill shopping district, this place is perfect if you're grabbing a quick something after shopping or a movie. Service is good, too. Interior is a snooze, but it's clean and I've always been able to get a seat. Another plus: seems like they're open all the time, so it's good for 3:00 \"lunch\" on weekends. Good veggie options abound!"}
{"text":"Overall great food.  Service: I can not comment on the dine in service but the take out service was great. Stopped in to order, walked around a little bit and food was ready when I got back.   Food: No matter what you get, you have to get a side of hummus and the hot sauce! Hot sauce= perfect amount of spice with lots of good flavor.  The shawarma wraps are good. Good falafel for those non-meat eaters. The Pitzas (pitta pizzas) are also fantastic. If you get the chicken Pitza, you will have a craving for it later that day because it is that good.   I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes Mediterranean food and would encourage those whose have not had Mediterranean food, to try it here."}
{"text":"Good food, not pricey and nice portion sizes.  I was visiting my brother and my wife and I looked up this place on yelp, he had tried it before as well and had no complaints, we ordered some take out.  It was ready in 20 min and we were eating in 30!  Haha.  Good quality and friendly service."}
{"text":"My first review!  I have been going here for years and I absolutely love everything about this restaurant!  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu but definitely get the hummus with a side of their hot sauce.  They sell the hot sauce too, perfect for marinating chicken and throwing on the grill!"}
{"text":"We visit Aladdin's often and are never disappointed. So many delicious menu choices. Has something for everyone. Family friendly but nice place to take a date too."}
{"text":"I love Aladdins.  Everything is always so fresh and good.  Prices are more than reasonable and service is good.  I love the Greek Pitza and the hummus pockets.  The Lentil Soup is great.  I don't care for their desserts; they're very dry.  THis is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Be prepared to wait on weekends and dinnertime."}
{"text":"Our family has been going to Aladdin's for 15+ years. We love it for lunch, a casual dinner, eat in or take out."}
{"text":"Takes awhile to get out for an hour lunch during work days."}
{"text":"The Shawerma was what I came for.  It came on a pita bread...which isn't what Shawermas should be wrapped in.  Other than that, they make the shawermas the way I like it...with Tahini sauce and tomatoes.  There was no parsley, thus the 3 star.  I had the shawerma to go...so it wasn't too hot by the time I got around to eating it.  The sandwich is actually pretty good, but not SUPER.  I'd go back to Alladin again though."}
{"text":"I want to drop in and leave a good review about the desserts. I have, since my initial review, been back for dessert. They have such a nice wide array! I personally prefer picking a slice of whatever has been least served - since I feel as though they are slightly fresher that way. so if you want to grab a dessert, I think they are a solid choice if you are looking for a cheesecake, cookie, or cake."}
{"text":"Wow!  Fresh, healthy salads(I recommend the lamb salad), courteous staff-I want to return and try other menu items.  The place is clean, bright with reasonably priced food. I am definitely going to come back!  PS -I also recommend the checkerboard cake!"}
{"text":"Very lovely place for smoothies and salads. In most recent memory a good friend of mine and I landed at this location after a three hour hike (read: got lost) around Frick Park. Starving, thirsty, and super worn out we decided on Aladdins because of their excellent smoothie menu.   Though the service was slow (that's something I've noticed everytime I've been here), the fare was delicious and my friend and I enjoyed the spacious atmosphere and air conditioning.   We both had some sort of strawberry and mango smoothie and downed it alarmingly fast. No regrets there.  We had falafel as an app and it was decent. My friend got the tuna steak salad and I went with a grilled chicken salad. My salad was overflowing with yummy veggies and came with a very good Greek house dressing on the side. It totally hit the spot and left my feeling satisfied without being stuffed. My friend loved his dish as well. I skipped on desert but my friend had a slice of carrot cake to go and later reported it was delicious.   All in all, if you're looking for some lighter fare in Squirrel Hill in a good atmosphere I would recommend you stop here. This place did look like it's accommodating for families as well!!"}
{"text":"I usually love Aladdin's but today it was unbelievably awful. I will go back again and hope things have changed.  For starters they charged me twice for tea (4.50) b/c they gave me a second tea bag. Had I known that it would cost me an additional 2.25 for a single bag of cheap tea I would not have ordered it. The least the waitress could have done is have told me that my \"free refill\" was not, in fact, free.  Also, the tuna in the grilled tuna salad was disgustingly fishy and overcooked. I usually order something different (the mishwi or lamb salad) so I am unsure if this is how it usually is but also the fact that no one seemed willing to fix the issue makes it far worse.   I told the waitress that she should have told me about the extra charges and her answer was that I was correct about her having to tell me but that she didn't and basically that sucks for me. No answer on the fish.   I have been a long time customer and am sorely irritated that I was treated this way."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience at this Aladdin's location than I have had in years at any restaurant.  We went on a recent Friday which was a beautiful day.   We decided to sit at the tables out in front.    Let me begin by saying that the waitress had stains all over her shirt, her shirt was partially untucked and her belly was hanging out.   If you got passed her appearance, she was not friendly and seemed to hate her job.   We were the first group to sit outside at the half a dozen tables that were available.   We placed a drink order and waited a good 15 minutes for our beverages to arrive.   In the mean time, all of the other tables outside began to fill up.  We placed an appetizer order of hummus an veggies.  We also placed an order for all of our meals at this time.   The hummus showed up within 5-10 minutes, which was reasonable.     The meals that we ordered never showed up.   After about 20 minutes we asked our waitress about them and she indicated that they would be right out.   After another 10 minutes we asked another waitress walking by if she could check on them because we had not seen our waitress again.   She never returned either.   After about 45 minutes of not receiving our meals I finally went inside and asked to see the manager.   The manager looked to be about 15 years old.   I asked if I could pay for the appetizer so that we could leave.  He did comp that to us, but never did find out what happened to our dinner.   We went across the street and got Burger Fi in less than 10 minutes.  There were tables that sat down after us, ordered, ate, and paid their bill while we never even received our food.  I was really looking forward to this location of Aladdin's opening up.   I have enjoyed the other locations.   Perhaps they are growing too fast.   Even though this location had been open for at least a month, it is clear that the staff was inexperienced and unprepared."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Large variety. Easy to find vegetarian or vegan options. Friendly wait staff. Great dessert case. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The extra star for having the balls to post their nutrition information online.  Food and service still very good if not excellent."}
{"text":"A gem. Great atmosphere and fantastic food offerings. I have yet to have a meal that disappoints. It is also the only restaurant that offers fresh juices in the Uptown district. An added bonus is a changing beer list. They carry a variety of seasonal micros."}
{"text":"Just starred trying new middle eastern cuisine. So glad I found this place. Fresh and so full of great flavors. I loved the pickled turnips, pickles and all the yummy sauces. Also their rolled pitas are my favorite. I wish my hometown had more of these types of restaurants. Friendly service and very clean, simple decor. If I'm back in the area. I am stopping in for sure!"}
{"text":"I used to love Aladdin's but unfortunately they've decided that it's easier to buy pre-made frozen food instead of make it themselves. Every time I've had faffel or kibbie it's been frozen inside and the hummus tastes exactly like the stuff you can buy at an Arabic/Middle Eastern store. As someone who is Egyptian I'm truly disappointed in how Aladdin's represents middle eastern cuisine. It's upsetting. Additionally, the service hasn't been very good at either the Crocker Park or Lakewood locations. Last time I went to the Lakewood location the hostess bent over and showed everyone her bottom - that's how short her \"dress\" was - it put everyone off their meal and tables were glaring, horrified. Plus, the prices are outrageous and they continue to go up each time I go there. I've talked to other friends and family and they all agree - save your money!"}
{"text":"For what you pay: fair prices.  Ambiance: Nicer on the inside than the outside.  Shopping strip facade. Service: Good Taste: great  So, I have been coming to Aladdin's for a while with my in-laws.  It's about time I write a fair review. If you're looking for a magic carpet ride, or a genie in a bottle, maybe your food experience here will be commensurate.  I have had the shwarma and pizza in the past and can vouch for its deliciousness.  It is savory and quite a munificent portion.  As a new vegan, my delight brimmed as I finished reading through their large vegetarian menu.  Many things can then be modified for vegans.  I recommend the falafel wrap and jasmine's favorite rice.  The wrap is one of the biggest falafel wraps I have ever eaten and the rice is a great side with it if you're hungry - otherwise, it is a separate entree!    Great place for a quick bite to eat! Parking in the shopping strip."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Aladdin's! I come here often and I've never had food that wasn't delicious. You really can't go wrong with the choices here and since I often eat vegetarian I like this place because there are plenty of options. The vegetarian appetizer is big enough to split as a meal for two and it has hummus with pita, taboulah, dawali and falafel; all so good! The pita wraps and the salad wraps are equally amazing and the pita pitzas are so good. Try Jafar's pita pitza, it's delicious.   And the best part? All this great food for SUPER cheap prices! The only thing keeping me from giving this place a 5-star rating is that the waiters and waitresses are often slow and really awkward.   Oh, and don't forget to try a slice of one of their amazing cakes. They are as good as they look!"}
{"text":"I had Jasmine's Favorite with lamb which is a rice dish and shared some Baba as an appetizer. I enjoyed it as I do most Middle Eastern restaurants. I don't think there is anything special. Portion size is pretty average as well.  I was dining with an Egyptian immigrant and his wife who travel back to the Middle East so I assume the the food is authentic."}
{"text":"Ate at this place once or twice when I lived near the area. The service is always nice and the inside is clean, but the menu is quite inauthentic and overall a bit bland."}
{"text":"I've had entrees, rolled pitas, and pitzas here, and I think the best deal for what you get are the rolled pitas.  I like getting the falafel pita, which is nice because they toast the pita so you have a mixture of different textures when you bite into the wrap.  I've had dessert here and I think it's hit or miss.  Sometimes the cake is wonderfully moist, but other times it's been really dry and as a result unappetizing.  I got a smoothie here and it was really bland and full of ice chunks because they did not blend it for long enough.  So in general, mixed reviews for Aladdin's."}
{"text":"so many vegetarian options! I like it because it is close to home and the food comes out quick. Our waitress, Ece, was really sweet and it was nice to reminisce about Turkey with her. I'm very picky about pita and that is the only flaw - not a fan of the pita bread. But I can overlook that. I'll def be back."}
{"text":"We've been here more times than I can count. The falafel balls are crispy and on point with so many vegetarian menu options to choose from. I'm not a fan of their pita but it'll do. The service is always quick and friendly and Aladdin's is extremely clean and family friendly."}
{"text":"I'm bumping this up to 4 stars. I don't know if management changed or what, but the service has been really good the last handful of times I've been there. Since that was my only real complaint, up to 4 stars it goes. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Bust out your magic lamp, but don't just wish for amazing Mediterranean fare just yet. It already exists in some form at Aladdin's Eatery in Crocker Park. You'll be met with a nice dimly lit dining room that may be very busy depending on the time of day. But don't worry, I hear this cave of wonders does carry out too.  We arrived for the dinner service and were promptly seated near the back of the room. The tables sat between single chairs and a long booth bench, the first major folly of Aladdin. We were seated between two other couples whose conversations were easily overheard. The guy across from me could have whispered sweet-nothings into his wife's ears and I don't need to hear all that baba ghanoush. A little privacy and less proximity would have helped.  The service was good. Our waiter was a bit persistent, not really giving us a chance to see the menu fully before asking for our orders. But I understand that, you want to give good service, at least he was nice and accommodating about it. They were prompt and classy, clearly attentive to the dining experience. They brought the food without a hitch.  We got a rolled pita wrap a piece. The falafel wrap was wholesome but we found the actual falafel ball/patty to be less crispy and chewy than what you may usually get. The hummus tabbouleh wrap was delicious though, the perfect amount of parsley and other veggies. The highlight was the hummus, creamy and flavorful. You can't go wrong with that hummus, among the best I've had.  If I based the review solely on food, I'd say four stars. But there are some reservations. Here are my three wishes for Aladdin's Eatery.  1. Space out the tables. You don't need to be seated like a sultan, but at least don't make it feel as if you're in the bazaar. 2. Be liberal with the food. If you're dining in, ditch the wrapping paper for the rolled pitas. This place walks the fine line between a restaurant and fast food. 3. Variety, variety, variety. Much of the menu is a regurgitation. The food tastes great, but the same ingredients across multiple plates is not innovation.  Aladdin's Eatery is certainly no diamond in the rough, but it is a rightful gem of Mediterranean food in the Crocker Park."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been going for years and the food is great. Little disappointing this weekend. When we arrived (2 people) the restaurant was only half filled. We were pleasantly greeted but escorted to one of those small tables with about 4 inches from two chattering teenage girls. They should have asked us where we would like to sit. The hostess quickly placed the menus on the table and began to leave. I told her that we would not sit there and pointed to one of the more secluded tables. She was very nice and moved us. I don't like to share my dinner conversation with strangers. The meal was excellent."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't even remember how many times I've eaten here. Tabouli, fatoosh, wraps / rolled (so many good ones but the schwarma is probably my favorite), hummus, Lebanese salad, Aladdin's favorite, i could just keep going. Love this spot"}
{"text":"How is this great food hidden in a strip mall? Healthy beautiful and hand made meals... great services and allot of choices. Tons of vegan /vegetarian options . The FATOOSH salad is lemony zesty magic! Lentil soup is comfort food love. And baba ganoosh is memorable."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very innovative recipes and food that tastes good. The soups are big enough for a meal. Pitza are very nicely made and yummy."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh food and they always have warm and welcoming people working. I never have a problem with getting in and out quick."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is one of favorite restaurants in the area. We can always count on this restaurant for amazing food at a reasonable price. Tonight was no different. We started off with a glass of wine and a bottle of Great Lakes Beer (both reasonably priced). We had the baba appetizer which is always exceptional (#TeamBaba #whataboutbaba)!    For are meals we both got the flavor savor which included chicken mishwi, beef kafta, brown rice, falafel and baba (was able to sub out the hummus :)  Our waiter Bharat was also exceptional. He was always checking us and refilling out drinks and pita bread.   I really can't say anything bad about Aladdin's. in my opinion you can not find a better value in town. For all that we ordered are bill came to less than $50!!  The quality, freshness, portion sizes and pricing is all top. Don't miss out!!"}
{"text":"Their lentil soup is the best. Its full of chunky potatoes, greens and whole lentils. I much prefer it to a pureed soup. That and Aladdins salad with spring greens, feta and some veggies along with fresh pita bread is a wonderfully filling and healthy meal. My daughter is vegan and when she visits from out of town, this is where she wants to have a meal."}
{"text":"Not bad, just not great, either.  I ordered the Tabouli Pocket, which was advertised on the menu as a pita filled with tabouli.  I wish they had had a photo because what I got was not what I envisioned.  My appetitie was light at dinner time as I had a large lunch so thought it would be a simple pita filled with tabouli.  It was a HUGE, GIGANTIC pita (never seen anything like it) filled with tabouli with lettuce underneath.  Not something you pick up and eat.  So I proceeded to eat with a fork.  The tabouli itself -- I've had others I liked better.    Anyway, I'll try again another time.  The menu options are plenty and the prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a great option for some quick, healthy food! I've been here a number of times, both dining in and taking out, and I've had a consistent, pleasant experience each time. I usually order the chicken shawarma rolled pita or the fattoush salad. The chicken shawarma is my go to if I want something warm to eat - the Tahini Yogurt dressing that it comes with is also super tasty! The fattoush salad is really refreshing and has a really delicious dressing made from lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic.  Service is always quick, and there is also conveniently a parking lot behind the building the restaurant so that's a plus! Overall, I recommend dropping by Aladdin's if you're craving some Mediterranean food! Their menu is also so extensive - you're sure to find something you like :)"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Indian food and found this place.   They do much more take out orders than sit down.  Needless to say,  waitress was ok,  food was good, and I loved the humus and hot sauce.   Though the pita bread was old and stale.   My meal was good and plentiful.   I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.   Better than average.   Not super."}
{"text":"4 stars for Pittsburgh.  Fresh, healthy, tasty, reliable.  Service is a little too in-your-face friendly.  And no, the food's not entirely authentic.  But still the best salad to be had in Squirrel Hill.    Plus, they serve alcohol.  Or a nice mint tea, if that's more your thing.  Great for parents, families, vegetarians, control freaks, etc."}
{"text":"We went  there Thursday night was almost full and busy. Our waitress was very nice and prompt, we were with our baby who is very active and everybody was very nice to us. Only my husband got food poisoning"}
{"text":"Vegetarians, rejoice! Delicious, affordable food for us IS available in Pittsburgh! As a self proclaimed falaffel expert, these are some of the best I've had. I usually get the vegetarian combo plate because I just can't choose!  I would prefer a little zippier hummus but I'm knit picking. Overall: perfection!"}
{"text":"Awesome service! there was a hair in my sandwich and the server apologized and offered me something else, they gave me a piece of cake and took the meal off my bill.! Wonderful Aladdins! :) happy customer!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, the food is always fresh and tasty.  Huge portions in the appetizers and entrees.   Good hummus w/ pita.   Falafel, schwarma always fresh.  Good alcohol selection.  Attentive service. Recommended."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've had middle eastern food, and one day we were craving some kibbeh and falafel, and ventured out there. I'm pleased to say the food was great! Both the kibbeh and falafel were well prepared and not greasy at all! The hummus was delicious too. Our server was polite and prompt - she even chatted with us a bit at the end, and showed her interest in world travel. Do not overlook this place!"}
{"text":"The menu here is very extensive, and a little overwhelming at first.  There are too many delicious things I want to try!  I had the wrapped pita with grilled tuna and the yogurt sauce.  It was really good and full of fresh ingredients.  I really like the pickles they put inside.  The second time I went, I had the baba falafel wrap. I enjoyed it even more than the tuna one.  The prices here are good for the food you get.  The house hot mint tea is really nice on a cold day.  They also have a large selection of desserts.  I can't wait to go back and try some new things next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"As much as I love Aladdin's food, this location is my least favorite one.  Don't get me wrong, nothing was bad, but I have had much better experiences at the locations in Hudson and Lakewood, especially with service.  Unfortunately, this location is the closest to where I stay when I'm in the area, and sometimes you just don't really want to drive far away.  I usually get the vegetarian rolled pitas here.  I like the baba falafel or the dwali rolled.  The baba falafel is filled with smokey, creamy baba ganoush, pickles, and crispy falafel. In contrast the dwali is more vinegary due to the grape leaves and has a more smooth texture due to the rice. The price is right with both running around $7 a piece.  The first time I ate at this location (one I ate in, the other I got take out) the toppings weren't really spread out throughout the pita which was a bit of a disappointment.  I didn't taste the baba in my pita until I got to the very end.  The side salad also had hardly any dressing on it and was dry.  The plate it was on was so tiny that I couldn't try to stir it around and spread what tiny amount of dressing I had.  Also, it took forever to get our order taken, waters refilled, get the check, etc.  The desserts looked delicious, but since everything took so ridiculously long, we decided to go elsewhere for dessert.  When I got take out, things were much better.  No complaints really.  I had the dwali and It was tasty.  This is one of the better choices in the area for vegetarian options, so I probably would go back, but I think I might opt for take-out next time instead."}
{"text":"I finally found someplace that serves Lebanese/Mediterranean food here after 4 months of looking. The food was actually really good. I ordered the fattoush salad with chicken shawarma. My only real complaint regarding the food was I wish the shawarma was shredded but that's really it. The salad was on point and the rolled pita was really tasty. The service was nice, not super fantastic but it was perfect for a lunch date."}
{"text":"Don't miss the Hummus with hot sauce.  Kabobs are excellent, but the meat is a bit over-charred. Fresh brewed iced tea... Always appreciated.   Great place for reasonably-priced, interesting food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and enjoyable experience.  I thought the falafels were amongst the best I've had in the Burgh and the beef shawarma was excellent.  One thing to note which is a negative than can easily be turned into a positive is that they did not sell alcohol.  So if you go for a date or something, drop into the nearby state store or beer market to buy some beer/wine."}
{"text":"We were craving some Shwarma and Hummus so we stopped here for lunch. We ordered Hummus, 2 Shwarmas-chicken and beef, a plated Shwarma, and a lamb roll. We all cleaned our plates!  It was served quickly and we devoured it quickly. Some of us got hot tea and some of us had iced tea. Everything we had was wonderful."}
{"text":"I decided to pickup food from Aladdin before my flight back home and I was glad I did. Service was really friendly and nice. They gave me several suggestions and I decided to get spicy kafta and chicken curry roll. Both were really good and I'll definitely be back when in Cleveland next."}
{"text":"When I find myself with an empty fridge or full of laziness while staying at my brother's house in Bay Village, we often turn to Aladdin's. And I'll echo Shannon C - their takeout definitely hits the spot!   You won't find anything over the top on their menu - just fresh, well put together wraps, salads and platters. Some standouts include...  1) Falafel wrap: Big in size and flavor, even more so when you add a touch of the spicy garlic sauce. The falafel is a tad dry, so you may want to invest in a bit of hummus to stack the deck in your favor.   2) Hummus: Creamy and spot on, espeiclaly with a multitude of pita acting like a toasty vehicle into my belly.   3) Tabouli: Well balanced and delicious  With sizable portions and quick takeout turnaround, Aladdin's grants my wish every time. (insert cheesy Robin Williams/Disney pun here)"}
{"text":"Always a great experience at Aladdin's. Get the app sampler, you'll eat it all! Always fight with the guy over the hummus and baba.   Don't forget to get a side of the homemade hot sauce. Perfect amount of heat and flavor. Chunky with fresh ingredients.   Not one for soups, but the V-nine is delicious! Not your normal mushy veg soup. Big chunks of fresh potatoes, tomatoes and squash, topped with fresh parsley.   Beef shawarma is my go to roll but the aryssis is just as delicious. Cheap and yummy!"}
{"text":"Having just moved to the area from metro Detroit we've struggled to find a middle eastern joint that stacks up to some of the places we used to enjoy.  Aladdin's does a pretty good job overall.  I wouldn't really call it \"authentic\" but the food is pretty tasty.  I've been to their Hudson and Cuyahoga Falls locations and the food was pretty consistent between the two locations."}
{"text":"The food is still good (Taza Chicken Salad, anyone?), the atmosphere is still generic, but I have to add that the managers (supervisors?) here are absolutely miserable to interact with, but if you're lucky, said interaction will be brief. Damn you for being so close and convenient!!!"}
{"text":"A cute little place that's a little ticked away in the shadow of Panera, Aldi, and the movie theatre, but def worth the stop. The baba ganoosh is amazing!!  Very well done!  The service so sweet and prompt. Would def go again!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Aladdin's. The appetizers always sound good but frankly when eaten with a meal it is too much food.  So this time I tried getting two appetizers instead of an entree.  And it was great!  I had the chili-lentil soup which is half lentil soup and half vegetarian chili.  It isn't mixed but poured into the bowl side by side. I don't know how they did it - maybe the had a ladle of each and poured simultaneously.  However they did it, it was delicious.  I also had the quinoa tabouli salad.  It too was delicious.    Another wonderful meal."}
{"text":"I really really want to like this place more than I do. I have eaten here quite a few times including the very first day they were open. I was excited for this place!  Every single time everything has been very decent. But it has never been great.  I love hummus but have always thought that Aladdin's is very bland. If you like baba ghanoush go for it instead here. I do really like their vegetable plate you can get with it.  The service is another area that is lacking. I always get the feeling that no one really cares about their job. Once I came in and ordered a couple slices of cheesecake to go (which are not very good. All of their cheesecakes are pretty much the exact same inside. Just different levels of prettiness on the outside) and was standing in the middle just watching everyone back in the prep area. They were all just bickering about everything with each other. Then one guy knocked a squeeze bottle on the floor which then got kicked by another girl and then picked up off the ground and refilled with some juice for smoothies and stuck back in the refrigerator.  Things like that just show that either the management is not competent or well liked enough to have the employees care about their job. I have been back a couple times since then, but am just not as excited about the place as I wish I could be.   I would love for a really good local Lebanese or Turkish restaurant to move into the area with food made by a chef/owner who really cared about what he was creating. I guess one can wish!"}
{"text":"4 stars just for the hummus, veggies, pita and hot sauce!! :) everything else is a little pricey, but healthy and lots of regular and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service!  I needed to be in and out in 30 minutes and managed it without feeling rushed.  Received pita bread with my meal, but no hummus.  That's okay, I was pleased with the complimentary pita bread."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!  So good for you, and so full of flavor, and the portions are huge.  So many vegitarian selections if you don't eat meat.  The hummus and falafal are wonderful.  One day I'm going to try the deserts, because they look amazing!"}
{"text":"I was stranded in Middleburg Heights for a full week of work and after 6 days had yet to find a restaurant with food that I enjoyed eating, until my friend brought me to Aladdin's!   This place is like an oasis of healthy, affordable food in a bleak area of mediocre restaurants. I loved my dinner so much that I brought the to-go menu to work the next day and my entire crew ordered lunch to-go. One of them commented that in the four years of visiting the Middleburg Heights area for work, this was the best food he had ever had there.   I highly recommend the Babaghanoush (spelling?) and the Sfiha beef pita wrap thing. My mouth is watering just thinking about them!"}
{"text":"Alladins is a go-to eatery for my husband and I.  Nice vegetarian selections.  This is a chain, at least in Columbus and Cleveland, and I have found consistent quality food across the locations.  Reasonable prices, except the baklava which is so expensive!"}
{"text":"The food was good but not fantastic. We got a lot of items. The desserts looked beautiful and interesting but we didn't get any. The fig cheesecake was especially intriguing. We got shawarma wraps, falafel, the flavor savor combination with jasmines rice, lentil soup, hummus, and a pita pitza for our baby. The pitza was borderline yucky. The cheese was flavorless and she wouldn't eat it after the first bite. It needs some work. Maybe if it was fresh it'd be better but we did take it to go. The hummus really does need more flavor. More garlic maybe, I'm not sure. But, it is saved by the hot sauce that they make! It's outstanding! As is the garlic sauce. The shawarma wraps were good, especially with garlic sauce and hot sauce! The flavor savor was a nice representation of their food but I felt like some of my chicken was missing, like it was supposed to be a whole thigh but was only like half a thigh. The beef was good but I'm certain it was previously frozen. The falafel were fine although a tad salty and potentially previously frozen. It did satisfy our desire for Mediterranean flavors and we'll give it another try for sure. The restaurant was very clean and the ladies that helped me, including the Manager, were both very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We were at the Model cleaners next door and since it was close to lunch we decided to stop in. Huge lunch crowd, but since there were only 2 of us we were able to get a table immediately. Always happy to see a lot of people, usually means the food is good. At first I was a bit skeptical looking at the menu, but that is understandable when it isn't typical American fare.  The closer and more I read the more relieved I was that I could indeed find something I liked.  I chose the lamp roll which was a pita stuffed with goodies.  More \"other goodies\" than actual lamb, but a great combo of flavors!  Tomatoes,  onions, greens, turnips, pickles, and a Yogurt dressing. There were only a couple pieces of lamb in it and they were fairly chewy. This could easily be solved if they put shaved meat in there instead of big hunks.  Overall it was good and I would order it again. My husband went with a specialty plate consisting of Beef Kafta(seasoned ground beef), Shish Kabob(tenderloin), and Shish Tawook(chicken) on a bed of brown rice  with vermicelli, served with greens, sliced tomatoes,  and cucumbers. He really enjoyed it, and is a big meat eater.  The service was friendly and they gave us a 15% military discount.  Great, fresh food Lebanese-American food.  Great find."}
{"text":"My husband and I both had a salad and both were excellent! We also shared a fresh fruit smoothie to go and it too hit the spot. We would highly recommend Aladdin's!!!!"}
{"text":"We came in on a shift change - menu huge and can be overwhelming. It was good we ate with locals.  Here's one to help you when you visit - definitely try the fresh humus with pita. I had the chicken salad pita wrap- my chicken was burnt and just average.  I did try some of the chicken pitza- yes pizza on pita bread. It was yummy and light. The desserts were really fresh and worth saving room for a bite !"}
{"text":"Aladdin's lives up to its reputation for wonderful Middle Eastern cuisine.  I love the variety of foods you get in the falafel plate.  They are always busy, fast, drawing all kinds of eaters, and creating a special atmosphere.  And - holy cow - those dessert slices are huge.  Maybe some day..."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is that they're open til 9 on Sundays. It's nice to not have to get fast food after work in the evening. The service is always quick & I've never had to ask for refills on anything. Their cakes are SOOO good. My favorite thing to order is the falafel hummus wrap. It's simple, filling & only $7. My boyfriend always gets the lamb platter & it costs $14 so it's pretty reasonably priced all around."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch after Christmas and had an excellent meal. We started with babaganoush and fresh vegetables. The baba was a little smokey tasting but good. My wife had the v9 soup and I had the chili, both were very good."}
{"text":"We are a real fan of Aladdin's food. Out favorites include babaganoush, vegetable soup, vegetarian chili, lentil soup, and wraps. The restaurant is always clean and service is great."}
{"text":"At first thought one would never think Aladdin's is a chain because of the quality and how consistent their food is. Everything on their menu is so fresh, flavorful, and light, you will be hard-pressed to find something that isn't delightful. They offer loads of gluten free and vegetarian options, plus an array of meat dishes. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is simple, yet sophisticated. Everything on their menu is made fresh-to-order daily. Start with an appetizer like the hummus, tabbouleh, baba ganoush, or falafel, all served with bottomless, fresh warm pita. Or one of their made-from-scratch soups like the lentil, chili, or combine the two in one, add chicken or keep it vegetarian, topped with fresh cheddar or feta cheese. For an entrée their rolled pitas are lightly toasted and served warm and much more filling than you might think. Choose from about 20 different options, and don't forget to order their house-made hot sauce on the side, which has just the perfect combination of spice, sweet, and salt, this could be eating by the spoonful. All their salads come served with one of their five homemade dressing, the 'Aladdin's Dressing,' a light, sweet, and tangy lemon vinaigrette is by far the best seller. And surely you will regret it if you pass up their baklava, the perfect little triangular-sized portion topped with fresh pistachios, it is by far the best baklava I have found in the city of Pittsburgh. On top of every menu item being so tasty, the prices are so affordable! Love this place for lunch, dinner, dine-in, or carry out, you cannot go wrong with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good.. All good! Eat there regularly.. at least twice a week for over a year. I have not had any bad experiences.. Great service and good food. Anna and Alexandria are exceptional waitresses! But all the employees provide great customer care. This Middleburg Hts. Aladdin's is a good restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been going to Aladdin's in Cleveland Heights and Independence for the past 16 years. I always get the same thing and they are always very consistent with exceptional service. So I was overjoyed when I realized they were opening one in Strongsville where I currently live.   Well, all I can say is, they have a long way to go with consistency and service.   I went about a month ago and they didn't put my chicken in my chicken vegetable soup. I went last week and they didn't put my sauce on my sandwich and then I go tonight and my chicken vegetable soup taste and looks like water. Instead of saying \"we are all out\" it seems the chef or management decided to stretch it with water.   I'm not sure how often l'll be coming to this Aladdin's, because it's definitely not living up to the long history or reputation of the others.   Very disappointed in Strongsville."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  We always have very attentive staff, the food is always wonderful.  One of my favorite places for a really big salad, we also enjoy their soups.  The kids love the grilled cheese pita with fruit, and you can't go wrong with one of the meat entrees.  There hasn't been a thing I've gotten off the menu that I haven't liked."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant in Squirrel Hill. Best hummus ever- it's super zesty and has an amazingly creamy texture.  I absolutely love the pita pitzas, especially the chicken curry pitza. The prices are very reasonable, and did I mention Wine Wednesday? That means 1/2 price bottles of wine!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Demonstrates that healthy food can be truly good and satisfying food.  Waitstaff was attentive and responsive.  Vegitarian companion and soy-free companion were thrilled with the menu too and everything was yummy and right.  Already planning next return and next order!  Dessert case definately NOT health food, so you might want to look away.  But the cookies were great alternative to dessert while watching the waistline!"}
{"text":"second experience here, as great as the first one. The humus, pita, v-nine soup and falafel pitza are all good! Will come back again, and highly recommend their pita"}
{"text":"Very beautiful small restaurants. The food is good and big portion, most importantly it is cheap! I ordered chicken shawarma and it is only a bit more than $6! Hummus is good and serves with a huge portion. Today they have 3 for $10 for appetizers. The service is nice too. The greeter is very cheerful and the waiters are helpful. Plus it has a lot of vegan dishes, more than 30! Want to come next time."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the water works mall! The prices were reasonable and the staff was very pleasant! Jessica the restaurant manager was extremely friendly and our waiter, Ben, was very attentive and helpful to us in explaining what different items on the menu were since we were first timers.  We got the baba to start and it was phenomenal! (The hot sauce is a good addition to it as well) we both got the Aladdin favorites combo which had a bit of everything and it was a great choice for first visit, I know next that I will be getting the steak kabobs! The portions seemed really big but I ate every last bite and felt satisfied, not to full but not hungry still. I highly recommend this place for good healthy eating!"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant to get off the highway on your way across the state and stop for delicious lamb, shush kebab, hummus, and just about everything else. Bravo!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just returned from Aladdin's and racked our brains trying to think of the last time we had food this terrible... he drew a blank, and I reached back a quarter century to the time my uncle bought me an inedible chili dog at South of the Border. Tonight is only the second time I have just left a meal sitting on its plate. I ordered the hummus schwarma plate, which consisted of 1) cardboard in a basket (\"pita\"); 2) hummus- not bad, actually; and 3) grizzled bland beef strips DIPPED IN CINNAMON. My boyfriend ordered the flavor savor sampler: 1) a few chicken strips, pretty good 2) hot sauce on salad, pretty good 3) \"mediterranean rice\" (bad buffet rice-a-roni vermicelli also DOUSED IN CINNAMON 4) gross sausage-and-other-components thing 4) falafel so full of raw spices it was actually gritty to eat. The food was not only badly prepared, it consisted of glaringly cheap ingredients. The restaurant was full, so maybe it was an off night? but given the quality and cheapness issues, can't imagine that's the case."}
{"text":"My rating is based on one visit with one shishkebab pita.  It was DELICIOUS!  It was only $6 or $7, and the portion size was PERFECT.   I left comfortably full and very pleased to have spent so little.  I hope the rest of their menu is as good!"}
{"text":"I live in Nashville currently, but I am originally from Pittsburgh and make a point to eat at Aladdin's every time I come back to visit.  Aladdin's is, by far, my favorite restaurant ever and I could literally eat there every day for the rest of my life and not get sick of it!  The menu is full of a variety of flavorful, creative, inexpensive, HEALTHY foods, many of which are vegetarian.  They offer everything from salads and soups to wraps and pita pizzas to full dishes.  Their hummus and pita is a must for an appetizer, and they boast some of the best falafel I've ever eaten (and I'm a falafel freak).  The smoothies and desserts are also excellent, so I suggest going more than once to get a taste of the incredibly selection they have!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Aladdin's! The menu is large, so the most difficult part of this experience was deciding what to order. Once the order was placed, our small (extremely generous for a small) order of hummus arrived promptly, as did the entre, only a few minutes later. Once the check arrived, I was surprised how inexpensive everything was. Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Very nice place for the family. They serve Lebanese style food. Casual but has some fancy dishes. Really fresh salads, beef shish kebab was perfectly cooked, ample portions. Only thing is food can take some time. Waitress was very nice, made a mistake with the meal but then gave all desserts and my meal free. All around good place."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is another overrated eatery in Cleveland. all the restaurants in this chain are pretty much the same, whether Lakewood, Akron, or Middleburg Heights. The stuffed grape leaves (dawali) was good, but the lamb pita was a disappointment. The meat was cut into too-big chunks that were impossible to chew without making a sloppy embarrassing mess. My salad was covered with a ton of cheese- why? When I brought this to the attention of the waitress, her response was like she really didn't care. Won't be back. If this is what passes for Arabic cuisine in Cleveland, I'll stick to cooking specialties at home."}
{"text":"It's a very cute place but I definitely wasn't a fan of the food. I ended up having them take my entree back and ordered a \"pizza\" which wasn't really a pizza. Too bland for me"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Med Grill yet, so I can't compare, but I'm really happy with the food at Aladdin's.  The portions are good and the prices are reasonable even for a poor grad student like myself (though I will \"splurge\" on one of the juices and appetizers if someone's treating me to the meal).    The falafel here is excellent--crispy on the outside, but moist on the inside.  I also enjoy the pickled veggies they add to the rolled pitas.  My brother, who absolutely hates getting his hands dirty/sticky while eating, thought they did a good job rolling the pitas here--no spills.  I like that they serve the dolmas and the foole m damas warm here.  My one quibble is that the pita bread that comes in a basket with the appetizers.  isn't served warm as well.  I've never had the tempting-looking desserts here because all the other food is so filling and delicious."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a quick, affordable, and delicious Mediterranean meal! Love the hummus and wraps."}
{"text":"This place was nice as far as decor and surroundings but it didn't leave me with the impression that its somewhere I'd frequent. I've been to several Greek restaurants and although this one has the biggest menu I wasn't too excited about any one dish.  When we were seated our waiter Tyler who was a great sport during our request for extra items. He was patient and played along with us as we joked. We ordered a lot of food just to see what different flavor they had to offer.  We order grape leaves, baba ganoush, two salads one with falafel and one aladdin salad and some kind of heart shaped pastry dish. I forget the name of it though. So my sister order the heart shaped dish and then decided she didn't want to eat it in order to save room for her salad. The eggplant dip aka baba was not as creamy as hummus  but was more like cottage cheese with a little crunch to it. It was just ok. The pita bread was served cool not warm or hot but cool. It lacked flavor and honestly tasted like bathroom paper towels.   When our salads came I had a dressing that was their tahini yogurt. It had the consistency of sour cream and tasted very much like it. I couldn't use it on my salad though because it had absolutely no flavor. It went great with the falafel but just was not a good dressing for an already bland salad. Both salad only came with lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese. I asked for kalamata olives on my salad to add some flavor but my sisters was supposed to already have some. When our food came out. Her's was missing olives and i had a full container of them. She tried to take mine because hers didn't have them so we called the waiter over. Tyler told us that her salad was supposed to have olives but that the extra cup did belong with my plate. I paid $1 for those olives!! So he brings her back some olives but only put three on the salad. I was laughing so hard. You give her this huge salad but only 3 olives?? that's an insult to the salad.  So back to my food. I switched out the yogurt for their balsamic vinaigrette which i told i wouldn't be charged for but when the bill came I seen it on there. I didn't make a complaint about $.65 cents but its the principle. After a $38 bill and a meal leaving you wondering if you ate enough. It's unlikely i'll come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Was craving a Greek salad... Yelp! Steered me here. It was great. Fresh mint (?) in the dressing-- deeish!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food!  It's very fresh, tasty, and affordable.  Three of the four of us at our table got the flavor savor plate.  It's a great way to sample the grilled chicken and beef, and the falafel.  The garlic sauce is a little different than what I'm use to in LA, but it was still delicious."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is the perfect place to go if you're a fan of Mediterranean food!  The falafels are probably some of the best falafels I've ever had, and their cakes and deserts are to die for. I'm also a huge fan of Aladdin's hummus!  I'll definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. The location is perfect in conjunction to where I live. A little outdoor patio is a nice addition as well. The pricing is fair. Service here at this location as of yesterday was subpar. Young kid, nice enough, but SLOW as all get out! Tables that came in after us received their food well before we did.  They give you pita bread as they say \"to munch on\" so I ask for hot sauce, TEN MINUTES later it was finally brought out.  I say that the Lakewood location runs circles around this location."}
{"text":"Let's just say, I have been here many times. But last night was the best. It was later on in the evening, place was busy, seated immediately, greeted by server right away. Her name was Devon (spelling?), she was hands down one of the best servers in any restaurant. The food, nothing but amazing. Desert, well that was the icing on the cake, literally. Everything about this place is spot on! Keep doin it!!!"}
{"text":"A good place for vegetarians to get a solid meal. The falafel is flavorful and fresh."}
{"text":"I went to Aladdin's for lunch with coworkers. We shared the vegetarian combo. Delicious! Very fresh. Hummus, Tabouli, Falafel, Dawali - so good!! Then a coworker and I split a Fattoush salad. Tons of flavor and fresh. If you're in the area and looking for a place to eat, I would recommendation Aladdin's."}
{"text":"I still like their entrees for nice budget dining, but I was not happy with their desserts.  YUCK!  You know those All-You-Can-Eat dessert lines - where all the cakes and pies look so amazingly good, but taste like nothing?  Well, that is exactly the case here.  Their dessert case looks too good to be true, and it is.  Now, I don't know about their Baklava, I have never tried it, but I will.  But it is certainly true for their cakes.  After 2 bites of each, I threw several pieces of cake away.  That is sacrilegious to a dessert lover like me.  It is like taking a bite of fake food additives.  Nothing tastes real about these cakes.  So after dinner, save yourself some $, don't be fooled by the pretty sky high cakes, and go to Prestis, Corbos, or even Heinin's for a slice of cake.    The other good news is that service is still awesome!"}
{"text":"Oh boy.. I have been here so many times and yet every time I crave for something different from Indian food yet close to it in texture and taste, I come here..   Their good is delicious and the staff are amazing. Do try their chicken curry shawarma roll and cheese cake.."}
{"text":"Good stuff right here bomb hummus! Service was good I will be back again oh and their smoothies are great!"}
{"text":"Aladdins is a staple in my food pyramid. I have eaten in a few times and the staff has always been pleasant. But I usually get this to go. Their hummus is creamy and some of the best I have ever had. I'm a creature of habit and usual always stick with the beef shawarma wrap or the falafel wrap. Some of the best middle eastern food around! Ask for some hot sauce on the side if you love spice!"}
{"text":"Love this place... I'm a vegetarian from SF and I'm here for work. They serve restaurant healthy veggie options that are delicious. The food is not over salted or greasy, it's like food I would want to cook myself at home. I have eaten here 3 days in a row now! The lentil soup with feta is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a chain, but you'd never know it. The food is prepared fresh, and is very good. I particularly like the hummus and would recommend the pizzas, as well.  One of the best things about Aladdin's, though, is that the price is very reasonable considering the quality."}
{"text":"The food was great, service was good too. It's a nice little place. Love the homemade hot sauce it's soo good especially with humus."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is one of those places that you visit maybe once a year and forget why you only go there once a year. You want something quick and healthier than anything else around so you order a pita and 25 minutes later when you're still waiting for your food post-lunch rush, you start to remember and wish you could get your money back because the food is going to be so-so and you've wasted your lunch hour. There are many Middle Eastern options in Cleveland that are so much better - particularly Nate's, the yummiest food and most efficiently run restaurant ON. THE. PLANET."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! The menu has so many choices and they're all so good :) If you're a fan of Lebanese food (or Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food in general), you will not be disappointed. I'm sad to be leaving the area."}
{"text":"Generally good and healthy. I wish their service were more consistent. Some days, the people who work there/ take phone orders are super nice, and some days they have terrible moods. Also, I don't think the hot sauce is so special to warrant the extra charge for a little cup of it. Falafel are pretty good for Cleveland. Food is probably 3.5 stars, but service hurts it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the new Portage Crossing, competing with a burger joint, a sub shop and Chipotle. Aladdin is the winner by far. For a chain, the food is great. The service was prompt and friendly. My kids loved the food, the first time they've had much of what they ordered. I'm thrilled to have this restaurant close by!"}
{"text":"I just finished d quick meal here.  It is in a really cute street and has some great outdoor seating.  The food was great and fresh.  I had the babba and a lamb roll better known as a Gyro.  With the Babba take the cute servers recommendations on the hot sauce.  I ended putting it on everything.  The babba was fresh and came out quickly.  I wish the bread was thicker like a nann bread and hot.  The service was the part that was exceptional.  Super friendly, engaging, great suggestions for other things to do in the area.  My server was so attentive that I felt like I a personalized experience. The gyro had nice large slices of lamb and the addition of turnips to the mix was my favorite."}
{"text":"Beef shwarma, hummus garden wrap and chicken pita pizza was all devoured and enjoyed.  Excellent service and nice place to have lunch.  The only recommendation I might have, coming from an area of the country that has hundreds of Mediterranean restaurants, would be to serve some hummus with the pitas.  Serving a basket of plain pitaas and no dip is like being serv d chips without salsa.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not many places you can get Middle Eastern food in the suburban wasteland of Mentor, but this is the oasis. We get take out from here and it's always delicious. I like the falafel pita pizza. But everything is good from the salads to rolled pita sandwiches. I'm not a dessert person but people seem to like them here. Great option for vegetarians."}
{"text":"This is a great option for any vegetarian--and I wanted to give it 3.5 stars.  Because I'd be willing to try it again--I'd just order differently.  Aladdin's has a lot to choose from.  My neighbors, growing up, were Lebanese and many of the dishes are very similar.  The good: Aladdin's is fresh and full of many great ingredients--and we were full by the time we left.  The desserts were excellent.  The baklava is hard to go wrong with--but pastries like this can be royally screwed up and these were flaky yet crisp and delicious.  The ambience is rather pleasant as well--although part of that would depend on who is around you but the restaurant is nice, clean and nice restrooms.   The not so good:  the flavors in some of the dishes were bland for me--it could have been what I ordered-or just the chef that night and i'd be willing to go back to give then another try.  I also got a smoothie I wasn't thrilled with. So it was decent overall--you might order Something totally different and be thrilled."}
{"text":"Pretty good Aladdin's...pretty good. I am a Middle Eastern snob and the food here in the mall between Ross Dress for Less and Marshall's far exceeded my expectations. The beef shawarma was delicious. The lavash was sufficiently thin and the meat was spiced well. It came with the crucial turnip pickles that I tried to make myself recently (but failed). And the array of deserts in the deli stand was enough to make my mouth water. There are vegetarian options for the lame among you, and my vegetarian companion said her sandwich was good too. The price is good, the food overall perhaps not as good as kassabs, but a solid second place. Perfect for a dinner and movie date since it's right by waterworks. Go on monday for the cheap movie tickets...look at me...now I am planning your life."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a gem of a family restaurant chain in the Cleveland area. They serve Middle Eastern food and have the best hummus in town. Everything here is cooked fresh to order and you can definitely in the flavor, that they don't skimp on quality ingredients. My favorite is called the Jasmine's favorite which is the rice dish mixed with roasted vegetables and beans. But their hummus and their baba ghanouj is an absolute must last every time you visit this establishment. And you can't skip on the desert. They have amazing desserts at these restaurants. Every time I come I bring home A container of baklava."}
{"text":"Uh I am just gonna give this place an ok review. I am not on yelp to try and  be the next new community manager poster child. I am here to write something honest  in the hopes it helps someone else.  Tally-ho....  I ate here with a large group --- we were late trickled in in groups I know this is annoying. But I sat for 40 min without being asked if I needed any water or if I wanted to order.  I got the lamb plate it was not memorable. Flavors are just ok a little bland on the spices for my taste. I would say the same about the hummus. Too chain for me. Then as our check arrived we were told it could only be split 6 ways no matter what. This would have been helpful to know before I ordered.   So you see this is a gracious 3 Starer. Bon appetit"}
{"text":"Very flavorful dishes! I always order take-out and it's consistently steaming fresh. The \"flavor savor\" specialty is my fav b/c it literally comes with everything you can ask for. Rice, salad, beef, chicken, falafel, AND hummus!!! My friends love to order the tabbouleh w/ lamb and aladdins falafel. The employees are always really friendly too. Only reason I'm giving them 4/5 and not 5/5 is because on one gloomy night I was sooo looking forward to my reliable flavor savor special, only to bite into my beef kefta and....IT WAS PINKER THAN WILBUR THE PIG SMH...and that my friends, is unforgivable."}
{"text":"Upon searching for highly reviewed restaurants to eat at I stumbled upon Aladdin's. With my wife being a Disney fanatic, I knew we had to try it (although the restaurant has nothing to do with the Aladdin movie). We normally don't eat this style of food so it was a little out of our comfort zone but we are very happy we gave it a try.   The waiter Victor was very knowledgeable and was able to recommend and explain in detail an appetizer dish along with suggested meals. We got a sort of sampler appetizer which was great and my wife and I both got the Jasmine dish, hers with shish kabob and mine with lamb. Delicious! The kids got the beef kafta. They didn't care for the beef but my wife and I tasted it and thought it was great. We gave some of the beef kafta to our one and a half year old and he gobbled it down! We also tried a fruit smoothie which tasted really good too. Aladdin's hot sauce is spicy but different. It's not your typical hot sauce which was a nice change of pace.   The only complaint I could really say is that parking is limited but I don't fault Aladdin's for that. The food was outstanding, the waiter was perfect and the atmosphere is nice. I highly recommend giving them a chance, even if it's out of your comfort zone."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that eating here was not my idea. This is not the sort of food that I prefer. I'm a meat and potatoes person, and prefer Italian, so a middle eastern, heavy on the vegetables restaurant is not my idea of the best place to eat.  The restaurant was clean and very busy. I ordered the Arayiss Pita Flatbread, which is seasoned meat and hummus with tomatoes, pine nuts and parsley. It was most excellent, extremely tasty. I also had their hummus and pita appetizer. The hummus was nutty in flavor but excellent.   The prices are reasonable, the service was good. I would go back for the same meal but most of the menu did not appeal to me due to the large amount of vegetables on the items. If you are vegetarian or looking to eat healthy, this place is great.  While I did not think that I would find anything on their menu to satisfy my picky tastes, I was pleasantly surprised and happy with my meal here."}
{"text":"Delilah = awesome. I've frequented this great place for years and she is far best the best server. Great food and wonderful service."}
{"text":"I fell in love with kefta here- specifically, their spicy kefta sandwich is amazing.  Fresh, simple- juicy spiced lamb, killer yogurt sauce, wrapped up in a warm pita with fresh lettuce, onion and tomato.    and i forgot how good baba ganouj was until i tried theirs.  house salad: A+  all fairly healthy, too.  I'm not a dessert person at all, but I find myself admiring their bakery case of beautiful pies and cakes, as well as traditional lebanese pastries."}
{"text":"Whenever anyone wants to hang out, I always suggest Aladdin's or I am secretly hoping they suggest it. Their hummus is to-die-for, their salads are fresh and unique, and I'm obsessed with their shish tawook rolled. Also, I love that I can get a side of the pickled turnips for only 49 cents (never tried them? Order them, dip into hummus, and thank me later). I love their juices and smoothies too. The service is also amazing - always quick and very friendly. Plus they keep your water glass full! I wish I could eat here every day :-)"}
{"text":"Aladdin's has consistently good service and good food. I ought to try different things on their menu but I always end up getting one of the same things I have had before. From what I can tell, it's all good and it seems healthy too.  A few weeks ago I went to a graduation party that was catered by Aladdin's and it was as good as you'd expect. People were diving in to this stuff and the falafel disappeared just like that. People were calling them meatballs and commenting on how good they were. The rest of the stuff looked really good (hummos, baba etc.)  and made for a different but interesting grad party. It was cool."}
{"text":"Love love love their chicken chili. It's the perfect thing to warm me up on cold winter nights. Their hummus is so good!"}
{"text":"I'm a rather picky eater and Mediterranean food is not my first choice but there is one dish at Aladdin's that I absolutely love!  It's the Mediterranean Shish-kabob platter.  The steak is juicy and flavorful!  The dish comes with a side of rice with vermicelli noodles, almonds, pine nuts and cinnamon. I love to wrap the meat in pita and drench it in Aladdin's garlic sauce. Ask for extra sauce. It's amazing! Be sure to check out the dessert case. It's always full of a huge and delicious variety of cakes. The portions at Aladdin's are sufficient but I never leave with leftovers. The staff is always friendly and never rushes you. If you're interested in Mediterranean food , or if you're like me and you don't, stop by Aladdin's for a tasty meal!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! If you are looking for fresh, yummy, and healthy food, look no further. We have ordered this out several times during our long nights of working on our new house. It always is delicious and filling. The to-go service is speedy, everything is always included, and all interactions with staff members have been pleasant. We are looking forward to going to the actual restaurant for a sit down meal. This place is not super super cheap, but then again, you get what you pay for. The food is quality and fresh! Also, their dessert case looks amazing!"}
{"text":"I love their food! I just went there for pickup and I was greeted as soon as I walked in. The lady was really nice. She was patient with me while I looked through the menu. It took my awhile because I had a cranky three yr old with me.  The food was hot and fresh. They had a really good selection of made-on-site desserts.  I ordered the chicken curry pita wrap add it was made perfectly!  My son had the chicken cheese pita pitza and my husband has the chicken Dijon pita wrap. All of it was fresh, hot, and quickly made."}
{"text":"Today I ate here for the first time. I ordered the Shish Tawook Rolled and it was delicious! The sauce was great and the pickles gave it a great crunch. I will order it again"}
{"text":"As a local college student, I often used to find myself looking for healthy food near campus.  Aladdin's was often my choice for a unique, tasty lunch for a decent price.  I love Middle-Eastern cuisine (Aladdin's is technically Lebanese/American), and this place is my fave place to get it.  The selection here is so huge I won't be able to cover it all, and the food is always fresh and flavorful.  They have all of my middle eastern favorites as appetizers: hummus, tabouli, baba ganoush, and falafel.  This is the real thing, folks - and these appetizers are a small meal in themselves!  The rest of the menu features delicious salads (incl. an Almond Salad, a Grilled Turkey Salad, and a great Fruit & Nut salad), pitas (and pita pizzas!), and great special dishes like Beef Kafta, their Shishkebob, and their lamb plate (amazing).  For you vegetarians out there, there is an extensive vegetarian menu, as well, so no worries, there's good eats here for you, too.  Drink-wise, there's a fantastic juice and smoothie list (the Raspberry Sunshine smoothie is my fave, and I love the Honeymooner, a juice they serve with carrot, cucumber and grape juice), or you could go with wine or beer if you like, though I never got much studying done that way.  They also have a long list of teas to choose from.  Their desserts are always changing but always delicious.  I recommend trying whatever delicious baklava is available when you go!  Definitely one of my all-time faves."}
{"text":"I'm glad to finally be getting to this review because I've been so behind and couldn't find my bookmark ~ whoop!  We trundled down here one afternoon after eating regular vegan fast food became a little blah. We love anything on a plate that isn't part of a dead being so any ethnicity will do.   Though this spot is supposed to be Lebanese there are a lot of middle eastern mixes in here that we've tried in a lot of countries around the globe.   Portions - HUGE. I mean very large. Unless you've managed to stretch out your stomach significantly, you will need a doggy bag. And should need one - as a fitness coach I have to say be responsible and make it a late night snack or lunch the next day. Flavours were right on, we didn't get anything too spicy, had some hummus, grape leaves, soup and something else I can't remember. At any rate, delicious and the salad - right I got a Fatoush - dressing was wonderful. Get it on the side and take some home it's got a lovely mint flavouring. It's a lot of oil so I recommend getting dressings on the side.   Tonnes of seating - don't fret about getting a seat midday during the week at all. We were a little unimpressed by the lack of table bussing but it's not a swish swish place so, lowered expectations, right?   Service was ok, friendly enough staff, pretty fast and generally polite.   We didn't try a dessert because it's training season for spring bodybuilding competitions BUT you should try them because they were plentiful.   Not too bad of a price point for the fact that we got lunch the next day as well.   Worth a stop by for sure."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting! Healthy and delicious! The hummus was so amazing and the pitza is awesome! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Aladdin's in Squirrel Hill is always delicious and they have a great staff.  Great food at a good price, with excellent service.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Very tasty middle eastern food. Try the \"flavor saver,\" a combo plate of chicken, beef, rice, hummus, pita and salad. The \"rolled pita\" was good, too.  Definitely try the hot sauce. It is more flavorful than fiery.  They have a display case full of desserts that look great. I'll have to try one next time."}
{"text":"My good friend is going to move soon for school and we decided to get a group together and go for some dinner. Aladdin's was a central place so we all met up there. LET ME TELL YOU IT WAS WINE WEDNESDAY!!!! What a great day to come! $5 glasses of wine and $2 beers! It was amazing.   We started off with appetizers and then didn't stop for a long time.   Appetizers:  Hummus: A creamy blend of chickpeas puréed with tahini and lemon juice, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil: Yummy! AND Yelp gave me a coupon for a free small order. Let me tell you, that small order was great. I love the creamy texture. Yum. I sometimes think that it could be better but I do not know what I would pick out as missing.   Baba Gannouj: Fire-roasted eggplant puréed with tahini, fresh garlic, and lemon juice, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil: This is my jam. I love eggplant. And I love that it comes with a side of spicy sauce that you can mix in or just keep on the side. We destroyed this small plate. There was a bit of the hummus left over but none of this. Tasted very fire roasted and smokey. Yummy.   Loubie Bzeit vgn: Italian green beans sautéed with onions, whole cloves of garlic, fresh tomatoes, and extra virgin olive oil: Our group of friends has a little joke about loubie since one of us thought it was pronounced loogie (like spit). I thought the dish was good, but not the best version I have tried. I think it was because of the bean choices. I like rounder beans and these ones were the flat ones and there were not enough tomatoes in the dish. But I would still get it again because even if was slightly lacking it was still good.   Salad Entrees:  Chicken Mishwi Salad: Fire-grilled marinated chicken thigh over greens, sliced tomatoes and cucumbers, calamata olives, scallions, and feta. Choice of dressing: We ordered this because we needed some fresh veggies. It was a salad. Not anything out of this world but it was good.   Pita Pizzas:  Ali Baba Pitza: Baba Gannouj topped with roasted eggplant, sliced tomatoes, feta, slivered calamata olives, and a sprinkle of oregano: This was my jam. I love the idea of using the pita bread as a pizza shell. This was a really good pizza BUT I will say we used that spicy sauce to sprinkle a bit on the top. It had a good flavor but no zing to it. I thought the addition made it perfect.   Sultan's Shawarma Pitza: Tahini Yogurt dressing topped with shawarma meat, onions, sliced tomatoes, diced cucumbers, and flakes of sweet basil: Oh yes. It was basically a gyro on a pizza. YUMMY. I would get this again for sure. I could not believe how much meat was on this pizza! It was over flowing with goodness. I do wish they had more cucumbers and less meat but then again I might be disappointed with less meat!!  It was a great night with great service and food. I cannot wait to go back on another wine Wednesday!!!"}
{"text":"I always love it here but tonight exceeded my expectations.  We called and placed an order for pick up and got stuck at an appointment a lot longer than expected.  We arrived 45 minutes after we said we'd be there to pick up our food and they said they wanted to remake our order so it was fresh.  It only took about 10 minutes and our order was hot and fresh and delicious and so worth it.  Thank you for superior customer service when it was our fault we were late!  I always get the hummus fafalel rolled and added tabbelouh with a side of hot sauce.  Tonight I got the stuffed grape leaves for the first time and they were fantastic."}
{"text":"On the low end of last week, a co-worker with a Lebanese wife brought me some kibbie, something I've only had once before at Crystal on Penn. Once I tasted it, I knew it was superior to CoP's in that it was simply more succulent. When I asked him where it was from, he said, \"I think it's from Aladdin's. Either that or Khalil's.\"  Another co-worker commented, saying that the kibbie resembled \"a turd.\" I told him that he in fact was \"a turd.\" He then went about his business.    Considering that there's an Aladdin's near me in Mt. Lebanon with more expanded hours of operation than Khalil's, I took Kay there this past Friday night.   Sure enough, that fried acorn of loose meat I had at Aladdin's was the same one I had at work. Served with a cup on non-fat yogurt and a chunky Lebanese Salata, anything else becomes extraneous.   Co-Worker of Darren W. also recommended the Lamb Roll, but I opted instead for the Shawarma Roll and was not disappointed. A thin, toasted pita scroll is filled with turnips (!), parsley, tomato, onion, lettuce, pickles, a Tahini yogurt dressing, and of course generous strips of seasoned beef. Terrific and inexpensive at under $6, Aladdin's turned in a torpedo of flavor if there ever was one.   The accompanying house salad was very similar, if not exactly the same as the one we had with our kibbie, the Aladdin's house dressing jazzing it up superbly.  I tasted the hummus, Chicken Mishwi, and Beef Kafta that populated Kay's Flavor Savor Special and enjoyed all 3. The hummus was particularly creamy without sacrificing its unique chickpea flavor and texture. Hey, forget chips and dip. Gimme some pita bread and hummus, and I'll be happier AND healthier.  Which brings me to what I'm really liking about Aladdin's; their food is good for you and doesn't skimp at all on taste. That Aladdin's is a chain specializing in Arabic food is interesting enough.That their menu might help you lose weight is a wish that could only be granted by the most benevolent of Djinn. That their food is so economical almost qualifies them for non-profit status.   That they have such a seductive array of desserts available almost makes them a culinary brothel.   Kay and I shared the Chocolate Fantasy cake (one of many choices, and they didn't have everything at the moment!). I loved the moussy/buttercreamish chocolate icing but found the cake itself to be a little on the day-old side.   Dana, our waitress, was an absolute dear who went out of her way to explain every single dish we ordered as well as share her culture and ethnic background with us.   Aladdin's doesn't build bridges like exotic cuisine often does. Instead, they whisk you up and over the mountains, oceans, seas, and deserts on magic carpets for a taste of the Middle East before bringing you back home."}
{"text":"I never liked hummus until I tried Aladdin's & now I love it. Besides who doesn't love pita bread to dip into it.. My fav thing to get there is a chicken salad wrap. Its very filling."}
{"text":"Both of us had meals that left us feeling hungry. The Hummus is very good. The rest of the meal, not. Service was excellent. The Server was wonderful.  I like the ambiance. I love the look of the beautiful desserts in their glass dessert case. The Carrot Cake looked spectacular. Menu choices for Vegans abound too.  Tip: Saturday night is very busy."}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's! This location is new and has been great every time I've visited. I always get the Jasmine's favorite with beef and a side salad. And obviously the hummus!!!!! So good. I've had The same server every time... I wish I could remember his name but he is a high schooler - tall with dark hair.  The service is always above average and he even remembered mine and my friend's order from the last time we were there. Will definitely keep returning to this location!"}
{"text":"We always love coming back when we come back to Pitt. Great falafel, salads, pita sandwiches, good service. Pretty much all the pita you want too. A go to place for Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews was keen on going.  Started with hummus that was OK but lacked garlic...was expecting more flavor...especially after reading some of the other reviews.  W had the chicken chili and really enjoyed it.  I had the Aladdin's Lamb Rolled in pita.  Unfortunately the lamb was way over cooked and hard to chew.    No time for desserts but the dessert case was full of homemade deserts.  Was talking with the staff and they said the deserts are made at the HQ baking location near Cleveland and trucked in a couple of times a week.  A family run business with the brother of the owner/creator running this and, I think, all the local locations."}
{"text":"Definitely outside my comfort zone, but noticed the crowd for two consecutive nights and convinced myself to try it.  Wait staff was very helpful and I absolutely loved the food!  Can't wait to return and try something else!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Aladdin's today with a colleague. Got there at 12:35lm and the parking lot was a zoo, which is pretty normal. Got inside and there was a wait. It went relatively quick. I ordered the shish tawook rolled and a side of rice vermicelli, my usual go to and I was really disappointed to open up my roll and find it completely falling apart. The bread had a huge hole in it so all of the sauce and some of the veggies and chicken had fallen out. Rice was good.  Service/server was just okay. Never refilled water, so I had to yell to get her attention."}
{"text":"I wish there were more places like this in the North Hills.  Healthy, delicious, and fresh food at a price that is outstanding for the quality.  I may be a bit biased, as I am a huge fan of middle eastern and Lebanese cuisine, but give Aladdin's a try, especially if you are not familiar with this type of food."}
{"text":"Incredible fresh variety including vegetarian and wheat-free choices at seriously bargain prices.   My meat-free meal (I try to eat meat-free at least a couple days per week) Jasmine rice with red beans, veggies, + a side of Loubbie (sp?) which is a tasty mix of flat green beans in a beautiful tomato and garlic \"broth\". Actually, I suppose it is a very loose sauce, garlic cloves left whole so that their flavor doesn't over power. Quite yummy.  Others at our table enjoyed lamb, beef, salads, falafel (which is a wee bit spicy here), their super smooth and creamy hummus.   Entree prices a serious bargain between $7.95-maybe $14.  Great service, wine available as is a very strong hot mint tea; and has been said they have a bigtime dessert case with all sorts of decadent and fancy cakes. Sampled last night was a German Chocolate cheesecake (yep) and a very complicated looking chocolate peanut butter layer cake which had alternating types of dark and light cake on each layer so that it was kind of a checkerboard pattern when sliced and was not cloyingly sweet.  We love this place :)"}
{"text":"I have no idea how authentic the food is, but Aladdin's makes my favorite hummus.  Everything I've had there has been great, try the falafel or the grilled tuna pocket pitas.  Very reasonably priced.  This is part of a local chain, and every location I've been to has had very friendly service."}
{"text":"This week was probably my 10th or 11th visit to an Aladdin's Eatery and 3rd trip to this one.  Their Hummus is wonderful, their Fresh juices are very tasty and their dinners are all very good.  Presentation is fine, not like Lolita's or Lola's, but then the taste is SO much better.  Not ever too salty, and very flavorful.  I will definitely be a repeat patron.  I love their Falafels, baba, and salads.  I have not found that any salad has too much dressing as it is always served on the side.  Try it, it's a great place for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Vegan Alert -- veggie combo and mujadra vegan if you drop the yogurt dressing.  Really fresh. I love Lebanese having owned a cafe in Detroit 11 years. This is almost authentic Lebanese except it's more fresh/healthy. Like SoCal Lebanese.   Delicious. Cheap. Vegan friendly."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Hostess sat us, and everybody walked by us with out a single acknowledgement that some body would be with us.  We use to love coming here."}
{"text":"Awesome place - great service, welcoming atmosphere, really yummy food and Oh. My. Lord. the dessert counter is amazing.  So good! I highly recommend the rolled pitas (shawarma  and shishtawook)!   Of course, its mandatory to get a dessert afterwards!"}
{"text":"My wife has become a hummus addict.  She's mainlining the stuff.  She is just short of approaching strangers when walking in a appropriate ethnic neighborhoods trying to score hummus on the street.  (An intervention is in the works!) Happily I just like the stuff, but I gotta admit, the hummus we had here today was great.   Pillowy clouds of creamy pudding-smooth garbanzo beans and olive oil that floated in billowing wisps just barely levitating over the plate on which they were served!   Pretty damn cool, huh?   We ordered the hot sauce to accompany same and it was a superb addition/complement.   This being our first venture here, we both got different combination plates that had a bit of this and that on them, including falafel which I found flavorful, but fried a bit hard, (dropping it might have hurt one's foot had it taken the right bounce), but the salad, lamb and chicken items were all quite good.  It was a true pleasure to have this wide of a variety of food all done quite flavorfully, just a few clicks from home! Our server, (Wayne), was quite good, johnny-on-the-spot at every turn with drinks, etc.,and was happily sufficiently conversant with the menu to offer suggestions completely from memory that were spot-on when we told him our inclinations. We'll definitely be back and took a carryout menu with us for those midnight hummus runs! Might be joining HAH soon! (Hummus Anonymous of the Heartland)"}
{"text":"Food is really good. I love the vegetarian sampler. Hot sauce is a must. Staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I LOVE Aladdin's!! I'm originally from Westlake and live in California now and Aladdin's take-out is my first stop from the Cle airport. I also go to the restaurant multiple times while visiting Westlake for a week (and have done so since they opened). The food is delicious, great quality, and very flavorful.  The service is always great and the restaurant is welcoming and clean."}
{"text":"I really love this place! my family and I came here once they started on their vegetarian  kick many years ago, and boy we weren't disappointed.   Their falafels are to die for and the lamb salad is crisp and fresh. My sister is in love with the chicken hummus plate, they provide you with a large serving and it tastes amazing! The hummus is smooth and rich in flavor.   Every time I'm on a date or am looking for a fun food place with friends i bring them to Aladdin's. My sister even ordered their food for her graduation party. They are great for any occasion!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but not any better than the Med Grill nearby.  The desserts are great, but not any better than Gullifty's, around the corner on Murray.  The vegetarian options are great to see.  But instead of three or four stars, it's a strong two.  I've been there three times, and each time, this has been the slowest restaurant I've been to in the entire city.   My guess at why they always look busy is that everyone's been stuck there for two hours, and that tends to keep it full.  If someone convinces me they fixed the problem with the speed, I'd gladly head back, but until then, they've burned through my goodwill."}
{"text":"I've complained (on Yelp and in person) that the Squirrel Hill Aladdin's is really a three-hour endeavor; the service has been awful, every time, but I keep going back because the food is quite good.  I drove by another location last week on McKnight Road, and it was like the clouds parted and bright white light shined upon the shopping center.  Shined enough that I decided to put this location into Yelp; it wasn't already here.  This place was *packed*, with a line, and we were still seated, fed, and out the door in 45 minutes.  The food was outstanding in every way, the variety was just shy of overwhelming, and did I mention the service was lightning fast?  Everyone in town should try eating here at least once."}
{"text":"Sadly, the takeout size for the salads inconsistent- with the version I got today being pretty pitiful. Barely any chicken and small overall- lots of turnips if you like turnip salad. I used to rely on this place for their healthy food but don't appreciate being still hungry after spending $9.25 on a salad and the price point is a rip off for the size. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST Lebanese food ever!!! Recommend the Flavor Savor plate. Baklava is excellent. Will definitely be back next time we are in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"It took me forever and a day, but I finally made it to Aladdin's to try some of their food.  I ordered the Aladdin's Kabob Rolled.  It consisted of char-grilled lean beef tenderloin topped with grilled tomatoes, green peppers, onions, greens, turnips, pickles, and Tahini Yogurt dressing, rolled in a pita.  The beef was moist and I didn't have to gnaw threw it.  I was able to sever the soft meat with one bite.  It was really really tasty and I want another one.  Can someone get me one?  I'm kind of hungry.  I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"We walked in Sunday about 6:50pm a young man, (manager)?  seated us with menus and that's it. We waited for about 10 minutes no server, no one else came over to ask, if we wanted water, a soft drink let alone greet us. So after waiting, we got up and left, by the way the restaurant was not busy at all. No one attempted to ask if everything was ok???? This is not the way Fady runs his restaurants, we know this for a fact. We are writing this somewhat review hoping his staff will bring this to his attention."}
{"text":"Normally love this place but placed a to go order and there was only 4 very small pieces of meat. Seemed like they don't give the same portion as if i was to dine in"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service for lunch. The lamb was perfect which I had Jasmine style atop a seasoned bed of rice and chick pea mix. Very gluten friendly."}
{"text":"It's not that anything went wrong, but if you prefer a less crowded and more intimate atmosphere (such as myself) then I'd suggest the Hudson location instead. Our waitress (Natalie) was polite and perfectly attentive but I felt like my smoothie was bland. I've had a number of their flavors and they all seem to taste the same :/   Otherwise, I was a smidgen bit disappointed with their selection of cakes compared to the Hudson location only because EVERYTHING was chocolate except for one lonely carrot cake. Overall, a nice place to take a date or visit for a special occasion dinner (the decor is beautiful!) but perhaps not a satisfactory variety for us picky (I'm happier with ice cream and a bag of chips) eaters."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! For those who have never been to Aladdin's, this place has some of the best middle eastern food for being a \"chain\" place. This is my third location I have been to, however, even this location did not disappoint.   So my brother and I were trying to get food before a 1pm meeting, and we knew Aladdin's was someplace fast and quick, but still relatively healthy. The place looked like your traditional Aladdin's - almost like a bakery, but with a pretty extensive food menu. It took them a little bit to seat us, but once they did, they were really speedy.   My brother and I get the same thing every time - a plate of hummus and hot sauce (this is a homemade middle eastern hot sauce, not like a franks red hot sauce) with a side of pita, a spicy kafta rolled (almost like a beef meatball) but with sauteed onions instead of raw, and a turkey rolled. Today my brother said he was feeling adventurous and got a chicken pizza, but sadly he was not a fan so I brought it home with me instead. He does not like honey mustard, and there was honey mustard on the pizza, so that was on him for not reading it before ordering.   The flavors are very fresh and not spicy. There are plenty of fresh herbs used, which help enhance the flavors of the meats. As I said, I usually get the same thing every time, and it is always the spicy kafta rolled. I know others who have gotten the lamb, and have loved it.   The service was also wonderful - our server was attentive as well as kind (two things I look for in a server) and for being a lunch rush, she did not seemed stressed at all! I believe the manager was the one bringing out our food to us, which was a nice to see. The location is a bit small, however, for a Monday lunch rush, they did really well getting us in and out in a good amount of time. Free parking is located behind the restaurant, but again, it is a pretty small parking lot and is shared by the surrounding restaurants (such as Buffalo Wild Wings), so you might have to pay to park if you're going at a later time.   5/5 would recommend - just make sure you like all the flavors and sauce before you get something."}
{"text":"Solid and good Lebanese food at reasonable prices! Great Rolls, Shwarma's & Kafta's and others, excellent Baba Ganoush & Taboulleh! Their garlic sauce is to die for! We dine at the restaurant on occasion but frequently order for take out. 15-20 minutes and your order is ready for pickup. If you enjoy Mediterranean (Lebanese) flavors you owe it to yourself to try out this restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy cauliflower side dish and chicken sambusek (descriptions below). I ordered lunch online and it was ready in 15 minutes. Today (Monday afternoon) was my first time at the Lakewood location.  The spicy cauliflower was absolutely delicious. It wasn't even that spicy and I love spicy foods. The cauliflower was full of flavour (spices) that I literally wanted more after I was done. I got the sauces on the side instead of on top. I don't like my food smothered in sauce. The price was under $5 which isn't bad. I'm definitely getting this again.   The chicken sambusek is chicken pieces inside a wrapped pita bread with spices and peas. Topped with tomatoes. The chicken was also well seasoned. I got it without any onions. This is what I love about Aladdin's. Their food always tastes so delicious.   No complaints. Just YUMMY!!!  P.S. I was so hungry that I took no pictures of my meal. Sorry.   DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT I ORDERED:   Spicy Cauliflower (vegetarian, gluten free) --  Fried cauliflower florets, smothered in tahini yogurt dressing and homemade hot sauce, sprinkled with spices and parsley  Chicken Sambusek --  Savory curried chicken mixed with onions, sweet peas, fine herbs and spices, folded into a pita pie and topped with diced tomatoes and scallions  **** This is my 119th Yelp review overall.  73 reviews for 2018. I am aiming for 100 reviews in 2018. Reviewed on 11 June 2018."}
{"text":"My lunch was absolutely delicious. I haven't been here in a long time so it was nice to come back. I ordered the Chicken Curry Roll pita sandwich. Below are the ingredients:   \"Savory curried chicken, sweet peas, onions, banana peppers, sliced tomatoes, cheddar, and Honey Dijon dressing.\"  I ordered my lunch without onions, no cheese, and with the honey dressing on the side. I absolutely loved my meal - the flavour of the chicken mixed in with the peas and the other ingredients was just perfect. My friend Gabby ordered brown rice with Chicken and veggies. She enjoyed her meal too.   Service was awesome too. Philip was our waiter and he was really helpful in deciding what my friend and I should order. Overall, I would recommend Aladdins."}
{"text":"If you like to eat healthy than this is the place for you. Can not beat the food or there prices."}
{"text":"We've been eating at Aladdins since the late 90's. Lately they have changed the portion sizes and there's significantly less chicken salad on a salad. We asked for a little more and were told we had to order a side for $3. The manager said there's just nothing she can do. What a disappointment. They've gone steadily downhill in both customer service and quality. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The service in this location is terrible--much worse than in the Squirrel Hill location, which is why I give them a 3.   The food, however, is the same delicious Aladdin's that we're used to enjoying!"}
{"text":"Aladdin's continue to exceed our expectations for delicious Mediterranean food. We absolutely love the food, and the service is prompt and friendly.   The food is consistently fresh and delicious. We've never had a bad meal at this location. The portions are enormous which means great value for your money. Also, they have a kids menu so they kiddo is happy too.  We love the white and dark meat chicken as an entree, on a salad, or on hummus. The soups are delicious. I've tried almost all of them, and they never disappoint. Before I was gluten free, I loved the pita salads and the other pita rolled options. Addictive!  Also, if you're having a vegetarian day today or everyday, this is one of the best places in Pittsburgh to find a menu that caters just to you!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing restaurant! Food was delicious, service was amazing, clean, fresh. Many healthy, gluten-free, organic, vegan, and vegetarian options. I highly recommend it. Alex was a great waiter! :)"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by admitting that I might not be the best person to review this restaurant. This was my first time eating this type of food. But based off first impressions I must say - it was very good.  We got the hummus appetizer with pita which was good albeit a little bit bland. Definitely ask for the hot sauce on the side to go with that, it perks it up and makes it good. Then for dinner I had a rolled chicken shwarma pita. It was very, very good. I would most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I would rate this as better than average middle eastern food. Our food came out fast, hot, and fresh. We BYOBed, had an appetizer, and two main courses, and our tab was less than $40. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Sooo, we took our kids for an afternoon lunch so as to miss the rush.  There might have been 2 other people there, so i would assume the service would be prompt...WRONG.  Everything took forever!  just tell'in the truth.  Hummus with veggies-- AWESOME! Pita-- it needs to be homemade or fresher---boooo Tuna Salad-- wonderful House dressing-- soo flavorful and delicious.  i love that it doesn't have vinegar   I almost considered giving this 2 stars because of the service, but i'm a regular customer and it was the first time it's happen (hopefully the last)."}
{"text":"A great place to get take out when not in the mood for chinese. We usually get the vegetarian combo platter, which has falafels, dawali, hummus, baba ganoush, and tabouli. Their falafels are fresh and crispy and taste great with some hummus. I also am a fan of their hummus and baba ganoush. Both are delicious and a nice change from store bought.   Their chicken lentil soup is so flavorful and tastes great the next day too. I would say my new favorite thing to get here though is the Aladdin's Chicken Pitza! The combination of their creamy garlic sauce and honey dijon dressing make this pizza amazing. I never thought of ordering a pitza here, but don't be afraid to do it!   We also like to get their rolls as well. The Aladdin's lamb roll is pretty good, but sometimes the lamb can be a little to chewy. The mediterranean lamb plate is a good option as well, the roasted pine nut rice is delicious. Overall, a great place for some fresh and healthy mediterranean options."}
{"text":"Pitifully slow and disorganized service at this location. Also, temperature in restaurant in set uncomfortably low. Came early before lunch crowd when restaurant was empty and still had to wait 20-30 minutes to get served. Food is good."}
{"text":"This place is a little bit on the pricey side but the food was pretty good! I really loved their hummus, salad, and the felafel. Not a big fan of Mediterranean food, I would only give it a  three star - maybe it was not too fair haha. The restaurant is usually not very busy so you will be able to get your seat very soon. It is also very clean, which I liked. You will also get a decent amount of attention from the waiters. Oh btw, the waiters are very friendly and charming ;)  They also deliver - our school has in fact ordered catering from aladdin's for MANY times, and our students loved it."}
{"text":"Do you have a place that is your \"go to\" place when you just want something that tastes good, in a pleasant environment and doesn't break the bank? Aladdin's is just that kind of place. Sometimes it gets pretty busy there, but customer service never suffers. The Lebanese/Middle Eastern Menu is broad, and delicious. The wine list is more than adequate at really affordable prices."}
{"text":"Chain restaurant style Mediterranean food.  Fair, but not the best Mediterranean around.    The menu offers the normal items you would expect.  Portions are smaller, and prices are more than what they should be.   Services we experienced the two times we were there was poor, and inattentive."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food, amazing prices.  You can not find a more value driven, service oriented mediterranean eatery in all of Cleveland.  Definately have the $1.99 all natural smoothie, lamb rolled, lentil soup, and chicken pocket.  Their signature hot sauce is perfect on most orders.  One of my favorite go to spots for dinner with friends or family."}
{"text":"After a double feature Sunday afternoon at The Manor Theatre, my best friend and I went for our usual dinner prowl.  We considered Indian, but it was a little far to walk, and then basically tossed a coin between Aladdin's and the Bangkok Balcony. Aladdin's won.  The interior atmosphere was huge and very pleasant, and the staff was actually very nice and accommodating.  The menu was pretty extensive, offering a lot of pita rolls, salads, soups, appetizers, entrees, and dinners, ranging from vegetarian to unusual, to the usual Middle-Eastern fare.  I ordered a Diet Coke, and my friend ordered the Pomegranate Green tea.  According to her, the tea was not only delicious, but incredibly fragrant.  For our dinners, we each ordered a variation on one dish, so we could try them both. They involved a plate of hummous topped with meat (I had chicken, she had beef) with some bits of tomato and parsley, with a basket of Pita on the side.  We also ordered a side of the rice vermicelli with pine nuts just to check it out.  The chicken was ok, lightly seasoned chicken thigh, cut into very small cubes. The beef was more seasoned and flavorful, and in bigger strips.  I can't say that I was very impressed with their self-proclaimed 'famous' hummous. No garlic, no lemon, no olive oil flavors at all. Just chick peas and tahini, that's all that could be tasted, and it was a BIG plate of it.  The pita was fine, and actually came abundantly enough to cover the ginormous portion of hummous.  The rice and vermicelli was adequate. Tasty, but not spectacular, and the pine nuts lingered with me for the rest of the evening.  I didn't realize that Aladdin's was a chain, or we might have thought twice about it.  I can't say it was awful, but I certainly can't praise it. I've definitely had more taste bud tripping Middle-Eastern food.  We were also kind of surprised to learn that they don't have any kind of Arabic or Turkish coffee on the beverage menu.   Huh?  Now I know we didn't branch out much with choices from the menu, but to me, if something as basic a Middle-Eastern staple as hummous doesn't come with much flavor, I'd actually be concerned about ordering other 'typical' dishes.  The bill came to just over $30 for the basic meal we had, and overall, I was not impressed enough to go a second time.  The space is pretty, the staff is uber-friendly (and the two Middle-Eastern guys sitting across from us were absolutely delicious to look at during the meal) but the prices were a little high for the product, and the product just didn't hit the spot as fulfilling.  Ali-Baba on Craig Street has a more limited menu - but the flavors are far better."}
{"text":"Always good food no matter what I try.  Service is always excellent too.  House mint tea, hot sauce and salads are my favorites."}
{"text":"Popped in here while I was running some errands and was delightfully surprised. Service was quick and attentive.   I got hummus and the falafel wrap. The falafel itself was good BUT it was slightly overpowered by the crunch of both the pickles and the beets.... one or the other would suffice.   But the hummus. Wow. I honestly don't think I ever want to buy it from the grocery store ever again, theirs was THAT good. Creamy and fresh and delicious.   Oh and that hot sauce???? Sooooooo flavorful, definitely get it (on anything). I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good food for a great price. Got Aladdin's favorite which gave me a taste of lamb, chicken and kofta. They have desserts that look delicious too."}
{"text":"Got a falafel for take out.  OK, but I've definitely had better.  I wouldn't go back to get this unless I really couldn't find anything else to eat.  It was fairly small and just not very tasty."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't crowded, was seated right away. The hostess was friendly. Server was nice. The chicken chili was excellent and falafel appetizer was very good. We shared a chicken sambusek that was really good too. It was $28.52 for two people."}
{"text":"Excellent service excellent meal! I would highly recommend. Try the diamond baklava it is one of the best"}
{"text":"Love the hummus with a side of hot sauce. I stick with the Flavor Saver and haven't been disappointed. I have been going since they have opened at Crocker Park and service has been okay - seems like lately they have had turnover. But quality of food is always consistent. I gotten take out quite a few times and have always gotten what i ordered - no missing items and packaged well."}
{"text":"Ordered online.  Great falafel, super tasty, nice flavor and crunchy on the outside.  Small hummus isn't small, plenty to snack on.  Tuna shawarma roll had good flavor, the crunchy pickle was an unexpected treat.  The desserts looked really good."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service and the food was great! This area is hard to find healthy and delicious food, this was a great find! I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food! I ordered the small hummus which is enough for two people. I had the Chicken Lentil Soup as my main course. It was very tasty and their portions are very generous. You have to save room for dessert! I'm still deciding on what I want...so many choices!"}
{"text":"As a vegan visiting Parma, Ohio from New York, I had very low expectations for any food I could eat here. And well, I was blown away by Aladdins. The atmosphere of the restaurant is calm and casual, beautifully decorated. The music is on point, too. Our waitress (Katie?) was adorable and very accommodating. The menu specifically listed all vegan options, which I greatly appreciated. I wound up getting the lentil chilli and the falafel wrap. They were delicious! Everyone else at the table was happy with their food, too. There were even vegan dessert options (I had the blueberry spice bar... YUM). We left a good tip and walked out very happy customers. I will be returning next time I'm in Ohio!"}
{"text":"Placed a $167 lunch order for the office today. They forgot to include one of our drinks and the salad orders were sub par. We order from this restaurant frequently! The lettuce was wilted and just looked old and tired. We spoke to the manager on duty...Jordon and expressed our disappointment. She said, yes we saw the drink as soon as you picked up the order...didn't call us...nothing pro-active to fix the problem.  Regarding the salads...\"sorry you were disappointed, is there anything else you want\"!  There are MANY Mediterranean style restaurants on the west side that will get our lunch orders that understand that keeping an existing customer is far less expensive than attracting new customers."}
{"text":"I not only love this place but also used to work here.  The food is soooo good. No where else does it for the price and quality that aladdins does (and im from chicago and love in san diego now) Also everything is fresh and clean and i always felt good about safety and cleanliness when I worked here. I ate here almost every night I worked and my roommates were often coming in for cake :) if I ever make it back to Cleveland I will be back! Miss this place"}
{"text":"I can't think of a bad experience I've ever had here. The food is rich in flavor, and lacks the additives and fakeness of a lot of food we've been accustomed to.  The prices put my husband off, because he thinks the portions ought to be bigger for what's on the bill. But he's also a huge fan of buffets. Aladdin's is orders of magnitude better than any all-you-can-eat offerings.  If you ever catch me there, you can pretty much be assured I'll be having some spicy kafta rolled, along with whatever other delicacies on which I decide to dine.  If you like flavor, fulfill your tastebuds. It's just a rub of the magic lamp away..ask Genie to take you to Aladdin's!"}
{"text":"It is so REFRESHING to find a restaurant like this in Mentor, where large steak-and-potato-chains dominate. The Lamb Salad is amazing, as is the Beef Kafta. Go out on a limb and try this place - it is always fresh and unique -  great vegetarian dishes too! Go with an open mind and you will love it! AND so affordable - most of the dishes are under $12."}
{"text":"70 degree weather called for a nice stroll in Squirrel Hill to find a place for dinner. Aladdin's had outdoor seating and so we were sold (indoor was packed anyway). Grabbed a table outside and our waitress was friendly and cute - helpful with dish and wine recs. Prices were oh so reasonable for dinner - I ordered Flavor Savor dish so got to sample a little bit of some of Aladdin's offerings. I enjoyed the chicken and the beef, both of which were very tender to the cut, along with the rice and salad which was dressed lightly. I got pretty full before attacking the hummus which was just okay though but overall I think Aladdin's will become a regular place for me."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is casual and offers affordable food. I tend to be boring with my choices at Aladdin's since I order the same thing- quality is consistent - but I always enjoy their kaftas and kabobs so I typically order the Flavor Special or their Shish Kabob plate with garlic sauce (I tend to find their tahini yogurt dressing lacking any punch). LOVE their garlic sauce but just make sure you're not going to kiss anyone afterwards as it is potent but oh just so garlicky deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Even after I've moved out of Pittsburgh, I make it my mission to come back to here every time I visit. Beef shawarma on jasmine rice might as well be food of the gods. Plus the hummus. I hate hummus. I do not hate this hummus. I would make sweet sweet love with this hummus."}
{"text":"I love the food from Aladdins, however this locations customer service skills and ability to take an order correct have been severely lacking lately. Four trips in a row they have gotten my order wrong, which I understand mistakes happen and it is a busy location for lunch however the lack of effort to correct themselves will keep me from going back."}
{"text":"Well, it was very clean, we were greeted (nicely) and seated promptly. We opened the menu, and quickly realized we weren't getting a little something to nosh for less than $20, so we left, and went next door to Lebo Subs, which was what Daughter suggested in the first place.  We would, however, come for dinner or lunch, when we were both really hungry, as the menu items sounded good."}
{"text":"a great little italian eatery in crock or park. every time i went there the service was excellent and fast. even ordering a pizza to split with my friend it was fast and an excellent amour of yummy tasty food. great place for a romantic dinner with your partner as well the atmosphere is perfect and the food is to die for"}
{"text":"Went to Aladdins on a Sunday night with the wife for dinner and we're were one of the two tables their. We waited 25 minutes for our food all the while not having silverware and a gnat floating in my tea. My finally got her food with burnt chicken and complained to see if she could get a new one or it to be corrected.  They did NOTHING and still had the nerve to bill us. The manager did not once say anything to us other than snicker behind the counter after I refused to pay for her burnt food that was not eaten.  We will never be coming to this Aladdins in Fairlawn again!!"}
{"text":"Overall the restaurant was good. But I wouldn't say GREAT!. The hummus was amazing though, especially if you added the spicy sauce on the side. Their house red wine was pretty good as well. I would definitly go again"}
{"text":"I went here when I was in town for Thanksgiving, but have been going to an Aladdin's for YEARS. There used to be one in Chicago down the street from where I lived, but sadly they closed, so I must come back to Cle for an Aladdin's fix.   My favorites: Aladdin's salad, Veggie combo appetizer (hummus, baba gannouj, tabouli, falafel and dawali) and the spicy kafta rolled pita.   The hummus really is delicious - they give you plenty of pita bread with it. Also, try their hot sauce! I used it on salad, falafel, basically anything.   Love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm from California but travel to Independence about every other month - every time I come I make sure to come to Aladdin's. The hummus with the spicy sauce (HAVE TO get the spicy sauce) is absolutely tremendous. If the pitas were a little fresher this place would be mind blowing. Service is super attentive and courteous, great portions, delicious food (I try to order something different every time), and Anchor Steam to boot?!?! A place after my own heart."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for consistently good food. I've been to several of their locations all over Ohio and I'm never disappointed. Some of my favorite dishes are the lentil soup, the chicken shwarma, and the aladdins combo which gives you a sample of three different meats with rice and a salad on the side. Their tabbouleh is wonderful and its not too vinegary which I've encountered in a few other restaurants. I always get the mint tea when I'm here. Its full of flavor and they brew it with fresh mint leaves. Also check out the smoothie selection while you are here. I just recently realized they had them and they are wonderful. If you gluten allergies or know someone that does they have gluten free options here as well. Their menu is vast with much selection so even the pickiest eater can find something here."}
{"text":"I ordered the lamb pita roll-up. There were 4 small pieces of lamb in the pita and a few pieces of lettuce, tomato and turnip. The lamb pieces were rather tough; it had a tough stringy piece in each. All-in-all it was not worth the $8 and I would not go back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while touring the Mt. Lebanon business district.  I was greeted and seated promptly. I did learn the following upon arrival: Yelp is offering a $10.00 voucher for $5.00 if you wish to purchase it. I'm always for good deals so that was a great savings. Also, they do not validate garage parking if you parking in one of Mt. Lebanon's indoor garages.  The menu is vast and extensive but my waiter was kind enough to explain the choices to me and help me come up with a decision. I opted for the chicken tender salad that came with cucumbers, grapes, and cranberries to name a few. This is a Mediterranean style restaurant so you can get a lot of meatless sandwiches and flatbreads.   Your are served a basket of pita bread but nothing to dip it with. I inquired about that and learned that if I wanted hummus or anything else for that matter then it would cost me around $3.95. I politely declined. To me, that is like serving you a basket of bread without butter and then charging you for the butter.  My salad came in record time and I was indeed pleased with both the presentation as well as the taste. It wasn't overfilling but enough for me. They have as you enter a case displaying various cakes if you want for dessert but I decided to pass on that one.  Another item of note is that when I went to the ladies room I noticed they have two toilets but neither of them have private stall coverings. Although they are not side by side, still it could pose a bit of a problem for women.  With the savings of $10.00 I actually in the long run was glad that they could shave $5.00 off my check.  Aladdin's is a chain so you will find it in other parts of the city. This is the first time I ever visited one and may check a different one out in my travels."}
{"text":"My friend and I were talking about Sega Genesis and Altered Beast at the bar tonight. A guy walked by and said how the ending of the game is bogus and the biggest let down ever. I explained that Altered Beast teaches a valuable life lesson. The idea of reaching the goal and journey far surpasses the accomplishment. When you beat a level, boss or game, it is always a bummer because you thought it would be better. Maybe the graphics or celebration should have been more grand.   I then discussed life and how it is sometimes hard to find a purpose or point. Why then would anybody play a simulation of something that may not have a point. That is more pointless than life itself.   Aladdin's Eatery is like a video game. In fact, I wish this was Aladdin's Castle video game arcade in Westgate Mall and the year was 1991 and I was celebrating my 10th birthday. The food is a big let down. A video game compared to real life Arab food down on Lorain."}
{"text":"What is a hummingbird's favorite food? Hummus! This is a good lunch option in Independence. The hummus tastes watered down. Aladdin's charges a little bit more than what it should be but I guess they get what they want. I rather eat any of the places up on Lorain west of W 117th but this is where I go when stuck at work. A lot of cute girls come here for lunch so I will be lurking in creep mode."}
{"text":"I love to eat at Aladdins when  I am looking for healthy food on the go. They have middle eastern fare that is prepared simply and with a lot of flavor. I am a creature of habit and order the same 3-4 dishes every time I eat here. Jasmine's favorite is usually what I get that is loaded with dirty rice and grilled veggie and beans. You can add protein or salad on top if you are vegetarian. They have a few different sauces if you want to dip into more calories. Their hummus and baba is the fresh and made on site daily. The pita is delicious and I always get double."}
{"text":"Delicious food and reasonable prices. I had the chicken hummus plate and it was great. Their hummus is the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for the first time and was very pleased with the atmosphere and food. The medium sized hummus was huge and very flavorful. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Located right in Crocker Park.  They have great food, inexpensive prices, and indoor and ourdoor seating.  I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The secret to enjoying Aladdin's (besides simply making sure that Middle Eastern fast food is your thing) is to understand its limitations.   Mainly, that's the pitas. Everything is pita (would it kill them to make the spinach-feta pie with a flaky crust?), and the pita is only so-so and dry. So make sure to order things that provide plenty of moistness.  If you do that, Aladdin's is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great free range chicken, gluten free, fresh, fantastic food. Baba gnoush (I'm sure I spelled that Wrong) was yummy. Garlic sauce yummy, shishkabob yummy...if you love Mediterranean...you must come here"}
{"text":"Always fantastic for dining in or taking out. We are particularly partial to the smoothies, rolled pitas, and soups. Don't forget dessert! Their baklava and cakes are decadent, among the best I've had in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Really good food, nice staff, and reasonable prices.  I love their hummus - and it's amazing with the hot sauce.  My other favorite is the jasmine's platter with lamb, but their rice sometimes is a bit mushy, which is disappointing. (Still not enough to detract from the entree as a whole though.)   I recommend their rolled pitas. I've eating so many chicken salad rolled. And the lamb rolled is my new favorite. Their chicken and lentil soup is good too.  I'd pass on the desserts though. I've never been very happy with any of the ones I've ordered (at *any* of the Aladdin's locations, and I've been to them throughout Ohio.)"}
{"text":"What is my wife thinking?? She gives this place 5 stars? She's the one in the bunny ears, btw. I HATE this food. Had it multiple times and I can honestly say it is probably the worst food I've eaten anywhere in Cleveland. A lamb pita thing that had no flavor and was tough as a shoe. A spinach and feta thing that had less crumbly white stuff than most letters sent to congress. And the spinach was a big wad of vinegary yuck. I don't know if this is the way the food is intended to reach the diner, or if it's just poor execution on the part of the staff. Either way, I loathe this entire chain. I LOVE Mediterranean food. Greek Village Grille and Somer's Diner(Greek owned and influenced I think) are two of my favorite places. And I like some of the local Middle Eastern restaurants. Aladdin's is the anti- Winking Lizard. A local chain that gets by on it's \"local\" tag, but really doesn't merit the praise. A haven for vegetarians? Yeah, I guess, whatever. I eat meat now and I think I'd rather eat my dog's canned food than ever eat at this bazaar of blah again."}
{"text":"For takeout, we've learned over and over to check the order. They consistently forget hot sauce, extra bread, salad dressing and other items. Great food, nice people."}
{"text":"A truly hidden gem in Cleveland, Aladdin's is one of the few restaurants that seems to get better and better. The dessert display is beautiful and the food is entirely authentic while bursting with flavour.   This is absolutely one of the best places to eat at if you're looking to stay fit without feeling as though you have too narrow of a selection."}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's just so so much! Came here for my birthday lunch yesterday and the service was outstanding and the food so so delicious, as always. I had the beef shwarma rolled and the baba as a an appetizer. Gotta love those pickled veggies on the shwarma! This is a standard choice for Mediterranean and I will always come back."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is by far some of the best Mediterranean food I've had in Pittsburgh. I have been to the Mt. Lebo location a couple of times and the service is actually better than this location. I usually get the baba and tabouleh, because you can't go wrong. I had the Greek pitza yesterday as well and it was very tasty, however, there was waaay too much feta on it. Every bite was feta and not enough veggies. Still a favorite and will keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"YUM! There are several of these in the Cleveland area and some in Chicago now as well!  The food is awesome, my favorites being the Fattoush, Hummus and any of the many Pitas that they have!  The smoothies are also fabulous and are made from real fruit and honey! I love this place! It's super resonably priced too. You can eat for under $10 and be full!"}
{"text":"The lamb was delicious. Nice and tender. It was cooked to medium which I love. Rice was ok jasmine has a different texture. I like the crunch of the vegetables. Had the soup for the first time! The veggies were out of this world. Think the broth was from scratch. I'm on a diet and this place kept me on it. Lamb had a beautiful crust and sear on it. The fresh garnish on on the plate was a nice touch. The ice tea was really good don't often comment on drinks, but I just can't get enough of aladdin. The waiter was really nice kudos to him being so honest with the suggestions and also, finding my favorite hat and putting it in a safe place. The portion will say is kinda small for price. It was a lil pricey for 2 people. But, that's what you get with fresh and homemade food. Hope to get that waiter again just wish it was nicer to sit outside. I always feel satisfied and full when I leave aladdins. The place is good for special occasions also. It's a fancy decor. The place is Mediterranean. They had a pretty neat design where their was rice different type of seeds and beans in a glass. This one does the offer for hummus platter you just have to show them thru yelp. But, their WiFi is not really good wish they had one for guests!!! Cause people love wifi!!!! Overall, this place is wonderful I highly recommend it even if your by yourself and also a good date place!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. They made it a lot better at some other visits. I did really enjoy the beef tenderloin. Cooked just right. The rice was ok. Food took awhile to come out its ok cause I know it's fresh. Had good service. I will be back.  Wish they had the hummus platter for free at this one for yelpers. Overall, they were able to accommodate a party of 7 very well. The beef tenderloin was nice and tender just the way it should be. Rice was flavorful but just a little soggy. I did like the texture of the veggies some of then added a beautiful crunch. Then, you get a hint of those beautiful fresh herbs. I do recommend this place because you know everything is very fresh. That's my kinda out to eat hope to explore more of peters township eatery. This is Mediterranean food, it's really healthy which is great. Some restaurunts most of their dishes are unhealthyy; but here its completely the opposite most of them are healty!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's, but this one in particular. I don't come here often enough for them to know me, but I am always greeted right when I walk in, in a familiar and warm manner as if they do recognize me. The place has been quite busy when I've been here recently, but I've never had a wait for a table and both the server and kitchen have always been speedy and the server always pleasant.   My favourite app at the moment is the Chicken Sambusek. It is folded into a pita that is warm and a bit crunchy. The flavor of the curry chicken inside is wonderful. If you are on the hungry side, one person could eat this on their own; alternatively it does cut nicely down the center into two wedges.   Lately I've been trying different menu items and I have loved each one that I have tried. The portions are large! Jasmine's dishes are quite a unique flavor owing to the cooked beans, but I liked it nonetheless.   If you have never been here before or just can't decide what to get go for the Flavor Saver - it's a little bit of everything I love and will definitely fill you up! The beef kafta remains a fav and I sometimes get a plate of just that.   Check online for nutritional facts! Kudos to this small business for going through the effort of providing that information!!

{"text":"This is just like all the other Aladdin's I've been to. Parking here is a bit more annoying however than most other locations as it is Cleveland Heights and there are meters everywhere that do not accept credit cards. There is a city parking lot - but again it has meters. That aside, the food and service were par for the chain, which is to say good. We went late in the day and the place was rather empty. Kitchen service was fast and our server was attentive. It's a good spot for a quick lunch or dinner. Big menu."}
{"text":"This Aladdin's is pretty large and they even have a patio, albeit it on the sidewalk of a shopping center facing the parking lot.   I've been to many Aladdin's all around town and the food here was consistent to all those experiences. Cooked well. Cooked fast. Great flavors!   Our server was friendly and actually did a really good job offering things to us. After we ordered our dinners, he asked if we wanted hummus first. When we said sure he then offered fresh cut vegetables to dip and listed all those that we could pick from. I've never noticed that on the menu, but you can pick really anything you want from radishes to cucumbers to carrots."}
{"text":"Healthy. Fresh. Fast. Friendly staff. Always clean. Consistent - even across locations. I can't get enough of this place; for a chain it continually impresses me. Free WiFi I discovered today as well - select \"Belkin.\" They even honour special requests like \"double chicken\" on the Fattoush salad visibly accurately."}
{"text":"Aladdin's provides everything fresh and zesty that I love about food. I crave this place for weeks at a time, and they make carry out so simple with their online options, it has truly become a \"problem\" for me. I've started adding Aladdin's carry out to my monthly budget...  Anyway, get the hummus with a side of hot sauce. I have no idea how they get their hummus so smooth. The consistency is addicting, and their hot sauce could be bottled and sold. I would buy it by the gallon. And it all comes together on their fresh pita to make a meal/snack/breakfast of champions. You feel healthy eating it, and it hits all of the perfect flavor notes.   Aside from the hummus, which I could live off of, I generally pair it with the fattoush salad. It's a bright salad with lots of flavors and textures. Very delicious. For something more substantial, I love their pita salad pockets (especially with the tuna steaks and house dressing!!) or the spicy kafta rolled. However, their menu is about 15 pages long, and you can't go wrong with any of the options. Everything I've ever tried is equally amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic hummus. Great food. We love it! All the locations are pretty much the same, and the food is consistently great no matter where you go."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian options. The lentel lunch dish was very tasty and the spinch feta wrap was very good as well. The limoncello cake was awesome!"}
{"text":"Flavorful, healthy food and great variety. Decor and service were just okay, but I loved my jasmine's special rice with Lebanese salata. If you like spicy, make sure you ask for hot sauce. Not too hot, but full of flavor. My favorite hot sauce evah!"}
{"text":"Their flavor savor is their best item. Their baklava cheesecake is something you could probably only find at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food.  I'd recommend it for lunch,  Their apps are bigger than you might think so share them."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 3 stars but I couldn't.... it was really unimpressive.  First, pretty plain place.  Basic tables/chairs, etc... but when I saw cinderblock dividers between dining areas that were painted, I took pause.  Since I'd seen all the positive reviews, I guessed it was the food here that was going to be good. So down I sat and was greeted by a friendly waiter.  I was really expecting someone of Lebanese descent or so.  Nope, pure Cleveland boy in his early 20s.  Nice enough, just a miss on what I would have hoped. I had the Aladdin's combo.  Three types of meat, rice, salad and pita.  Plenty of food, none of it inspiring though.  The chicken was the best... not really seasoned, but grilled and nice and juicy.  The other chunks of beef and lamb (maybe) were slightly overdone for me (more medium) and not really seasoned either.  The rice was just OK.  Salad is salad. Wish I had maybe gone to a chain since this left me wondering where I might go the next time I'm in Cleveland.  I'm 0 for 2 so far. On the upside, it's a very reasonable bill for the portion size."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite healthy eats. They have great food for a good price.  They have the best humus and Favs bean dip in town.  I recommend the chicken sambusic platter and if you are GF just have it with NO pita. This place has endless GF and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I got the falafel pitza (pizza), a lamb pita roll-up, and a ground beef pita roll-up. I enjoyed the falafel pizza the most out of the 3 items. The falafel was tasty. The ground beef pita roll up was good, but if you do not like curry, I would avoid this. The lamb pita was kind of bland, and there was not much lamb at all. About $20 for all the food, and it was pretty filling for two people. So, definitely some highlights and lowlights."}
{"text":"Portions are smaller and service wasnt as it use to be. I find this to be true of all the locations. The food is still good, but other places have gotten better."}
{"text":"The service wasn't perfect, but the food was very close. The best part of the experience were the cute girls with large posteriors."}
{"text":"OF course this place is great. If you've never been to an Aladdin's you are crazy.  The desserts are amazing, the tabouli is good and their different rolls are great.  The nice things is the food is great at a very affordable prices."}
{"text":"We went after reading reviews ad had a great meal.  The baba ganoug was delicious and the main courses were all really good.  We appreciated the freshness of the food without a lot of additives.  I would recommend it"}
{"text":"So tonight was the second time I went to Aladdin's and all I gotta say is all I ever get is bland bland bland. Tonight I ate a greek chicken salad and there was nothing special about it at all. Maybe I should have ordered something better. Maybe it's just an underwhelming franchise."}
{"text":"I'm not particularly impressed by this restaurant, which has a bit too much of a chain feel to it; there are other, better places for comparable food around the area."}
{"text":"I moved to New York City two weeks ago and I miss this place.  I miss how fresh their smoothies tasted and how it cured any ailment I had from headaches to colds.   I miss their falafel and hummus. I haven't found a place in NY that duplicates the freshness and balance of flavors Aladdin has.  I miss their wraps and rolled pitas. I know it's not ethnic, but get their chicken salad pocket. It's one of the things I crave when I'm in NY.   I miss their soups. Get any of their soups. If you're not sure which one to get, try one of their combos. The flavors always work with each other.  The only thing I wished for is that  I tried their desserts. They taunt you from the glass case when you walk into Aladdin's."}
{"text":"As I'm writing this THE DAY AFTER I was here....my breathe is still kickin.   Garlic breathe be damned through THREE teeth brushing cycles and 2 mouth wash swishes. But it was worth it. So sorry for whoever has to talk to me the next day.....   I had heard SO many good things about this place that it had been on my places to try list for a while now. It absolutely did NOT disappoint! Thanks to Carrie L.'s suggestion, I got the Mediterranean Lamb Plate. The lamb was cooked to perfection and surprisingly had little fat for lamb. The rice was also fantastic, because who doesn't love a little sprinkle of pine nuts on top!? I was really not too keen about the Greek yogurt sauce but LOVED the garlic sauce (hence the garlic dragon breathe!).   The decor inside is also really cute! I love the glass accent pieces and I really wanted to keif the little vases with cute wooden flowers on our table. Since I try not steal....I did not....don't worry!   For a Mediterranean place to also be famous for desserts is a big surprising. But I had also heard many good things about their choice of cakes and cheesecakes. I had JUST been to the Factory of Cheese earlier in the week so I opted for a Coconut Cake. I love me some coconut and it was the perfect combo of moist cake and coconut! Yum-o!   They need a location downtown! I have to hike it to the burbs or Squirrel Hill for my fix now. But it'll be oh so worth it!"}
{"text":"I had an early lunch at Aladdin's today before flying home, and was pretty impressed.   I let them know that I needed to catch a flight, and they assured me that I would have time to eat there.  My order was taken promptly-- I ordered the vegetarian appetizer sampler with a rolled pita, which was plenty of food for lunch and enough to take in a box for second lunch.  Everything was great--- lots of flavor, perfect falafels, and good potions.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for something a little different."}
{"text":"Went there a few nights ago with the family only half hour before closing.  Staff was cleaning up and getting ready for closing but regardless showed us excellent service, was very helpful in explaining certain things on the menu, and the food was fresh and hot brought to our table."}
{"text":"I had the beef and chicken combo dish with pita, and it was really good especially for the price. Also two thumbs up for the friendly waitress who suggested this dish. Next time I'm passing through Cleveland and I'm near an Aladdin's, I'll have to try their other dishes. Too bad they don't have a chain in my neighborhood in California. Oh, well. Otherwise bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Hot sauce is unreal. Even if you do not dig spicy- get it! Hummus is out of this world. And it's very reliable middle eastern food. Very good dishes."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Aladdin's for an early Saturday dinner recently. My first time there and I was pretty excited about it! I love Lebanese food and it's been on my list of places to try!  We were greeted and seated quickly and I noticed maybe only 5 other tables occupied at that early hour. Our waitress was friendly and helpful...to start. (She later became the reason for a 3-Star instead of a 5-Star review) She suggested a Lebanese wine (which turned out to be delightful!) and gave us time to peruse the menu. We opted for the Dawali and an order of Hummus for appetizers, and for our entrees I chose the Jasmine's favorite rice with lamb while my husband went with the Chicken Sambusek Plate which came with a salad & choice of dressing. Our food was delivered fairly quickly by another server, and my husband noticed he didn't get any dressing for his salad. After some time our waitress came to take the order of a nearby table. Cool... after she takes their order she'll come by to see if everything's OK with us, right?  Wrong. We tried to get her attention but she left without even giving us a glance. She returned to the neighbor's table with their drinks and we got her attention as she was walking away again. She approached our table but instead of \"is everything OK?\" Or \"How are your meals?\"  We got hit with an exasperated and snarky \"Can I help you?!?!\"  Damn!  We are far from \"needy diners\". He just wanted his salad dressing!  (By this time the salad was pretty much the only thing left on his plate.) Salad dressing arrived. I received a take-home box for my leftovers. Then we waited for our check. And waited. And waited some more while our waitress filled drink orders for 3 other tables and disappeared for a while out of sight. We ended up waiting A HALF-HOUR for our check!  She apologized with the excuse that she just got 2 tables in her section with 5 or 6 people seated at each. I'm not sure what happened...why she went from friendly & attentive to snarky & non-existent over the course of our visit, but it was REALLY frustrating for us.  Let's get to the food!  Everything was AWESOME!  The Dawali were some of the best I've ever had!  Tender, flavorful & tangy!  The lamb on my Jasmine's favorite rice was well-seasoned and juicy. Some of the smaller pieces were overcooked but overall I really enjoyed this dish!  The rice had the perfect blend of spices. Very nice!  My husband enjoyed his dish too. Especially after he received his salad dressing! Again, if not for our waitress ignoring us and then giving us attitude, this would've been a 5-Star review. I'd like to return and hopefully give an updated and more favorable review."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere with the Moroccan feel. Food was average and could improve. Hard to find if you are just looking for it from the street. However, I like the uniqueness. There are not too many Moroccan restaurants around, so this is a place to go if you have a feeling for Moroccan food."}
{"text":"The selection of Mediterranean foods is very good as is the service.  My lamb on rice dish was excellent.  My wife had the falafel salad which she enjoyed.  I would definitely go back to try other things."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is one of the restaurants that I pretty much always go to whenever I visit Cleveland.  Then why did I rate it only 3 stars you say?  Well...  The Good: pitzas, wraps, cheesecake, smoothies  The Mediocre: service.  The wait staff doesn't seems to be very attentive in general.  The Bad:  1) Small serving sizes.  I know it's supposed to be a healthy restaurant, but that shouldn't mean portions so small it's impossible to be full unless at least one appetizer is ordered.  2) Salads.  I'm a very picky salad eater and unfortunately salad is a very prevalent item on Aladdin's menu no matter what you order.  Maybe I need to try a different dressing, but I usually get balsamic vinaigrette and it just doesn't integrate well with the salad.  Every time I eat it I feel like I'm eating grass soaked in pure vinegar.  Now that being said.  I think I always go there because there are definitely some dishes that I enjoy there and because it's a healthy alternative compared to my boyfriend's typical pizza/burger places.  You should definitely try it at least once though.  I guess after being there so many times I'm getting bored of the same menu over and over again."}
{"text":"Solid low-key squirrel dining spot. Everything on their (quite long) menu looks delicious! I like how they mark what is vegetarian. We ended up starting with the Dawali (grape leaves). The large came with 6 pieces, topped with crumbs of feta cheese  I had the \"falafel pitza\", which was a flat pita topped with banana peppers, tomato, and of course falafel. I love how the pita was toasted so that it was a little crunch, and the falafel was delicious, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they charge extra for hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I've traveled through Syria, Egypt, and Lebanon, and while I''m not holding anything at Aladdin's to that standard, the menu's just too overpriced and mainstreamed.  You'd be hard-pressed to find anything offensive on the menu, but just as unlikely to be blown away.  Moreover, when I recently ordered the $14 lamb plate at Crocker Park, I got 3 solid chunks of lamb and 4 thin slices of mystery meat  (did not taste like mutton).    I'd actually recommend Kan-Zaman over Aladdin's, and there you can also get a fun, tawdry dose of Middle Eastern pop music."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was an angsty teenager, and even then I wasn't scared to profess my undying love for their nirvana-inducing delicacies!  If you're not \"lumberjack hungry\", a rolled schwerma will probably do you just fine, and at around $6-7 the price is right.  If you're really hungry though, go for one of the specialty plates.  The lamb, kabobs, anything.  It's all good.    For a bigger group, definitely start with the vegetarian appetizer plate.  Their hummus and baba are to die for!  Great smoothies, too.   V-Nine soup is also one of my favorites... ok, I could go on and on so I'll just stop now.    But seriously, go eat there!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  I especially like the shishtawook and chicken shawarma rolled pitas."}
{"text":"I literally get carry out at aladdins almost every day of the week for lunch. Greek chicken salad-it is divine! Always so fresh and filling! The dressing is amazing and nothing is better than the fresh pita. The staff is really friendly too!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Squirrel Hill location, which I would rate a solid 5 stars. But I now live closer to the Freeport Road location, and I like to support local business. I've gone twice, now, and have been disappointed each time. The servers are great. It's the food and the price of one tiny condiment that prompts me to write. First, the food. Twice, I have ordered the falafel salad, and twice I have been served less than fresh salad greens. Some had rust spots and other pieces were just limp. I don't know if it's because they have less traffic at this location, but there really is no excuse to serve anything but the best. With the salad comes the garlic sauce dressing. I ask for it on the side because that's just me. What you get is one of those little plastic cups that isn't even filled to the top. My estimation is that it's about two tablespoons of dressing, if that. Garlic dressing is thicker than most dressings, so what comes in that little cup is not enough for a salad of that size (or price). Each extra cup is $.65. I make this sauce at home, so I know a tiny serving like this doesn't cost that much.  The other weird thing about this place is the location of the restroom. You have to walk through the kitchen and servers' station to get there. Not only does this conjure bad dreams of germs wafting from the bathrooms through the kitchen, but I just don't want to see how clean or unclean the prep area, kitchen, or dishwashing areas are either before or after eating my food. There is another bathroom upstairs, and if I ever go back, which is doubtful, now, I will use that one.    I really wished for more from my two trips to this location, but I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my meal of lamb while my daughter quickly consumed the cranberry walnut salad. Quick service too"}
{"text":"So much love for Aladdin's!  If you haven't heard,  they have the best hummus. EVAR! YOU CAN'T FIND BETTER!  And add the hot sauce. So good. All of the soup is fantastic.  I love their salads. The house dressing is insanely delicious.  My go-to meal is the Fatayer plate. It's their take on a spinach pie. Crazy delicious.  They also have a nice wine list.  Go. Eat.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a chain that manages to feel like a visit to your adoring Mediterranean grandmothers table for dinner.  Every time I've been the food is fresh and completely home made.  Delicious flavors, huge menu, huge portions, reasonable pricing, nice atmosphere and some of the most sinful desserts I've ever seen (It's hard not to lick the glass shielding the cakes on display as you walk in).  My only knock against them is the majority of the food tends to be heavier than you'd expect, so expect \"Mediterranean soul food\" and expect a pleasant coma afterwards!  Good to be aware of, but certainly nothing to stop me from gladly coming back!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Aladdin's. I like to carry out from here or catch a quick lunch. The food is always fresh. I can order a healthy salad and leave completely full.  One of my favorite items is the appetizer platter. This platter is loaded with hummus, baba, stuffed grape leaves, pita, and falafel. It is fabulous. I could eat this alone, but usually I'll share. I highly recommend ordering a side of the spicy sauce and mixing with the hummus. They also sell their salad dressing, which I am obsessed with, for carry out.    They have a drool worthy dessert case. Giant chocolate cakes, cheesecakes, baklava, pistachio bars, and more. I always grab some to go, because the salad and pita fill me up.   This is a must visit for good middle eastern cuisine. Worth the calories."}
{"text":"This little restaurant in a strip mall serves fantastic Middle Eastern food. The pita is paper thin and fresh as can be. I had the grilled lamb dinner served with seasoned rice with vermicelli and pine nuts. The lamb was hot and deliciously seasoned - washed down with 2 Almazas (Lebanese beer - a very respectable Pilsner). The diamond baklava was crisp and sweet without being drippy with honey. Don't miss the fresh coffee - dark and rich but not as nasty as Turkish and no mud on the bottom. The waitress was friendly and right on the spot. Try this place. You'll love it, too. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's. I went with my cousin and the food here is fantastic. Great value for what you're getting. We ordered a plate of hummus to begin with and it was creamy and had a sprinkle of zatar. The pita was the right consistency of crisp along the edges and soft in the middle.   I ordered the hearty vegetarian lentil soup, which came to only three dollars and some change.   The interior was low-lit and spacious. Everything was clean and comforting. I would recommend anyone who wants Lebanese comfort food to come here. Healthy and tasty that's all."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food everrrrrrrrrr! Their hummus is simply amazing, they have 40+ variety in vegetarian food which is very hard to come by. We tried farmers market pitza and falafel appetizers it was lip smacking."}
{"text":"Aladdins is one of our favorite local chains so we know the food is good.service was also solid.  We split the mujadara with hot sauce and a falafel hummus wrap. The Hudson location is quaint being on the newer downtown area. I think this location is a bit better than the Rockside Road Independence one."}
{"text":"Great food and selection for vegans and vegetarians. Service was great. If you enjoy muddle eastern food or just want some healrhy choices this is the place to go."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a healthier lunch or dinner option, then seek out your nearest Aladdin's Eatery. Their lentil soup is simple yet delicious and any of the rolled pitas are filling choices.  A couple dinner offerings to consider are the Flavor Savor Special or Aladdin's Favorite Combo, which offer an ample variety of Lebanese centric fare.  There's really not a bad choice on this expansive Middle Eastern / Mediterranean menu.  Even the kids menu is appreciated since there's an option for fresh fruit as a side.  If you have any room left the large desserts are tempting, but the peanut butter + chocolate cheesecake was underwhelming -- the search for a delectable, 'must have' dessert continues.  Dine in or take out...it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm back in Northeast Ohio, Aladdin's is one of the eateries I look forward to returning to most.  For me it strikes the right balance of tasty Middle Eastern dishes made with quality ingredients at a very reasonable price.  When caught without a car, I have actually biked 10+ miles just to get my fix.  And when I had my wisdom teeth removed, their hummus was one of the first soft foods I incorporated back into my eating routine.  I have trouble exploring the menu beyond my two favorite salads--the Greek chicken salad (with feta and pickled radishes) and the Taza salad (with honey dijon dressing, pine nuts, and dried cranberries).  Both are enormous and filling.  I enjoy supplementing the greens with a small order of hummus.  Note that the accompanying pita is the flat, thin, unleavened kind--not thick and fluffy as \"pita\" can sometimes connote.    Our server this past week, Abigail, could not have been friendlier or more efficient at every stage of the meal.  Her professional and pleasant demeanor added to an already delightful meal.  Thanks, Aladdin's!"}
{"text":"Clearly much has already been written on Aladdin's, but one unique thing to note--I believe that the salad servings are larger at this location than at the Hudson outpost.  Yesterday's Taza Chicken Salad was served in a proper salad bowl, as opposed to Hudson's use of a soup-style bowl.  Same food, but more for your money here!  The soups and the chilis seem to pack the most bang for the buck--economical, tasty, and filling.  They also respected my request for a light cheese topping by not gobbing up the whole dish.  I always leave Aladdin's feeling happy and full."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and wonderful fresh food. Barbara was a personable and knowledgeable server. We will be back for more terrific Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Aladdins is one of those places where you can't go wrong no matter what you order. The food is very fresh, the meat is always cooked perfectly, the sauces and dressings are out of this world, the deserts are great, its byob, and has an outside patio you can drink on. The kafta is my favorite."}
{"text":"If I didn't live so far away I would come here all the time!! If only I had a...magic carpet. Sorry, that was terrible.   Onto the food! The pita, hot sauce, and hummus that serve as the appetizers are delicious. Make sure you ask for the hot sauce because I've never had anything as amazing as that. Also, don't be too intimidated by the name; I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy foods, but this was more than manageable.   I ordered the sampler entree plate, which came with beef, chicken, rice, and a salad all on one plate. The chicken and beef were seasoned and cooked perfectly, the rice was flavorful, and everything tastes really damn good.   If I had to go again, id definitely try out the pita rolls. they have a wide variety of types and have great value: $6 for a roll easily the size of my arm.   Thanks, Aladdin. You've opened my eyes to a whole new world!  ...okay, I'm done."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to eat! The ingredients are consistently fresh and delicious. The extremely helpful staff always ensures the dining experience is pleasurable and comfortable. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu, but tabouli is a favorite. Some may not be accustomed to a fresh menu but it's worth it to try!"}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's and I don't know why I don't come here more often maybe it's simply because there are no locations close where I generally spend my time and because the times I have been to any of their locations it's always packed and with good reason!   I passed the Aladdin's driving home from Wexford and decided to stop for an early lunch on Saturday at around 11:30 AM.  The place was not yet very busy but was packed by the time I left around 45 minutes later.  I asked my server what she would recommend and she suggested the lamb plate with the garlic sauce and hot sauce.  It was absolutely fabulous.  It was the perfect lunch (brunch) for a chilly day.  The desserts all looked divine, but I opted to forgo dessert but did have coffee which was delicious.  I plan to go to Aladdin's more often but plan to go on \"off\" times to avoid the crowds.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that my boyfriend and I have both been in the restaurant business for many years so we are both very critical.  One more disclaimer is that my boyfriend is a chef and we are not vegetarians, so our pallets are used to much stronger flavors.  However given all that our experience was still pretty mediocre.  Our favorite part of our experience was the atmosphere, we sat in the front window and really enjoyed the view of Cleveland.  Our service was just average, she made some recommendations (the flavor Savor, and Jasmines favorite) but she didn't go out of her way to make sure our experience was good, she just kind of went through the motions of serving us. We went with her recommendation, I added lamb to the Jasmine dish, which was the best part.  Our major complaint with everything is that it was evident tat nothing was fresh, the vegetables in my rice were clearly canned, and the chicken was obviously par-cooked and not fresh, and the beef was dry.  We enjoyed the sauces a lot which almost masked the low quality ingredients.  The hummus too was underwhelming, it was okay but it could have used a little more flavor.  We really expected something fresh and house made given that the restaurant specialized in vegetarian dishes, but we were honestly pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I really like the food here but the service is always atrocious. After the first bad experience in the restaurant we started ordering to go.  We decided to   give the restaurant a try again tonight and I'm actually angry upon leaving.  -We were seated and waited over 15 mins to be acknowledged.  We placed our order.  I got the chicken chili to start and the Jasmine beef shawarma.   -We waited for a half hour, watched people sat after us get their drinks and entrees, no sign of her.   -She brought everything including my chili out at once and disappeared again.   -She brought me the wrong order - a beef shawarma roll but she never came back so I ate my chili in hopes I'd see her again by the time I was done with my chili.   -I ate my chili, my husband finished his entree.  We never saw her.  No refills, nada.   -She asked if we wanted the check and we explained that I was given the wrong dish.  It was uneaten.  She seemed confused.... Said she'd talk to the manager.    -She came back and said the manager told her they'd have to charge me half of the Jasmine beef shawarma price.  She actually thought this was acceptable.    -So instead of having the $14 beef shawarma I didn't receive get taken off the bill,  they charged me $7.  The roll I was given incorrectly and DIDN'T eat only cost $6.25!  -I was charged $7 for something I didn't eat or receive.  I was charged for having a bad experience by the manager.   I will not be back, not even for take out.    Worst customer experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"A great place! The food is attractively presented, freshly prepared and timely. The menu is logically put together and offers something for everyone. Vegan and vegetarian options are many. I prefer my food a bit more spiced so I use quite a bit of their in house prepared hot sauce. The smoothies are great! Also a reasonably priced selection of beer. The salads are fresh and there are many to choose from. Love the Mujadara Plate a bed of steamed lentils, brown rice, Lebanese salad, hummus and fried onions. You just feel better when you eat healthy food! The table service has always been excellent. I go often to have a quiet lunch. As a family outing, my 7 year old granddaughter loves the child's pita pizza's with cheddar cheese and extra feta. Always perfect. Along with a glass of freshly juiced apple and carrot juice, it's a deal!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered a new love for this type of food, and had grown tired of driving downtown to Boaz. So when I saw that Aladdin's was the same type of menu, was nearby me at Crocker Park, AND had online ordering, I was very eager to try it.   First, I want to say that I love that everything on the menu is clearly labeled vegan, vegetarian, etc. As a vegan, trying new places can be scary, and I sincerely appreciate their dedication to a healthful and clearly labeled menu.   My favorite items are the hummus, the falafel, and the Mujadara power salad. Their hummus is creamy and delicious, the pitas are huge and satisfying, and the falafels are cooked to perfection, with just a hint of spiciness. I've ordered takeout from here just 2x so far, but will definitely be a frequent customer.  Now, I know up to this point my reviews sound like all the others. But what made me decide to write a review was the excellent service we received tonight. My husband and I picked up our takeout order, and upon arriving at home we realized it was the wrong food. Usually, if I don't want to go back out, I'll try to salvage what they gave me. Unfortunately, both entrees had tons of (delicious smelling, tbh) meat. I called the restaurant back, and the first gentleman I spoke to was apologetic and quickly got the manager. The manager I spoke to was Chris, and he truly went above and beyond my expectations. He gave a sincere apology while he looked up my order, and said he'd be refunding the bill back to our card. Then he offered to remake the correct order for free if we wanted to come back. My husband and I trekked back up to CP, and they gave us the entire order, plus an extra order of hot and freshly made falafel, and a ton of extra pitas. We had enough food for at least 4 people. And best of all, the manager gave us a $15 gift card for our trouble of coming back up, which was completely unnecessary, but greatly appreciated.  I am so happy to be a customer at a place that has delicious quality food, and excellent customer service. I highly recommend Aladdin's if you're in the area. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few chain restaurants I enjoy going to for dinner.  Their vegetarian appetizer platter is fantastic.  Delicious hummus, baba ganoush, grape leaves, felafel and fresh warm pita bread.  Its also such a large plate that one person could almost make a whole meal out of it.  We had the skewer combo for an entree.  It came with grilled chicken, beef and some kind of delicious stuffed sausage.  The grilled meats were served on top of rice.     The only part that left us kind of underwhelmed was the dessert.  The server showed us the options and pointed to a peanut butter cake, that ended up just being sheet cake with peanuts on top, no peanut butter to be found :-(.  One of the least exciting slices of cake I have had in a while!  Oh well, we will try again next time.   Overall though, this is a great restaurant.  We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Just finished a wonderful dinner at Aladdin's Eatery. I had the best hummus (better than Sabra!) and V-9 Chicken soup. I love to try new things so I will definitely be back for more. Also-if you're up for dessert, try their version of a \"lady finger\"... You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Only thing that kept this place getting 5 stars is when I went in to pick up my to go order, the two at register annoyed the shit out of me. Stop the conversation and great your paying customer. I could care less about the color of the key band and how she hates purple.   Customer service is everything doesn't matter how good food is. Get it together!  First time ever eating at Aladdin's. Best hummus I ever have had! Tried grape leaves appetizer and was surprised how much I liked them."}
{"text":"The Squirrel Hill version of this regional chain was as good as casual dining gets! The menu is extensively filled with a variety of reasonably priced fare. Salaam provided helpful and extremely cordial help in filling our table with beautifully prepared, delicious food. The fresh fruit smoothie, hummus appetizer, pita, and chicken pitza were all pleasures. I'll watch for this chain as it continues to grow and look forward to a time when I can become a regular at one located closer to me."}
{"text":"I eat at Aladdins locations all over the place; Mentor, Highland Square, and Montrose being my most frequented. My favorite of all of them is Montrose. Despite living closer to the Highland Square location, we always drive out to Montrose. Maybe it's because Annabell's isn't next door to the Montrose location? Or perhaps because I don't have to watch people panhandle outside of the window at the Montrose location?  Delicious food, attentive staff, and a good atmosphere. Their fresh brewed mint tea is my favorite during colder months, where I almost always have a sore throat. Their beef kefta is by far my favorite, and their hummus is to die for. Also, i want to bathe in their hot sauce."}
{"text":"Their hot sauce is great. Since change of menu it's been hard for me because a lot of my favorites were changed but a majority of people will honor the adjustments and make it the old way. Very clean inside, service is always on point."}
{"text":"Literally the most amazing Mediterranean food in the area. I come here every time I'm home from school and it's absolutely scrumptious. The hummus is a MUST and get it with their hot sauce. That sounds weird but trust me on this..... best combo to hit the 412. Anyways my gf and I decided to share the lamb platter and it was cooked to absolute perfection. Also I got the tabbouli salad which was so perfect, i love the amount of lemon/lime juice. Makes for a great complement to any meal there."}
{"text":"Excellent food, perfectly flavored and always fresh-tasting.  Service was fantastic....I felt like I was being invited into the owner's own home!"}
{"text":"I like Aladdin's, their food is good and the service is pretty solid.  I'm not sure why I don't love it tho?  I've never had anything that I didn't like here but I still feel like it is missing a little something?    On my most recent visit I had their Greek Salad and one of their specialty teas.  Both were good and the salad was huge."}
{"text":"For a healthier option, I love the salads at Aladdin's. My go to entrée is their grilled chicken fattoush salad. Not sure what special herbs/spices go into the dressing but it's a very unique blend. The grilled chicken tenders have always been tender and juicy. Also love to get some of their smoothies. I'm a big fan of the kale fruit smoothie right now, price is decent $2.75! It's in a shopping center so parking is easy."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Middle Eastern food in the area, I recommend Aladdin's Eatery. I ordered the hummus garden roll - it was very large, filled with fresh vegetables, and less than $7. Also, I ordered it to-go, and it was ready in less than 5 minutes. I'm excited to try their chicken shawarma next time."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer here for the cakes. I specifically like the almond and tiramisu cakes. They offer the best cakes with a subtle flavour when compared to very sweet cakes I had at other places."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Aladdins location by far, always friendly on the phone when ordering take out. Always order the aladdins falafel roll and a side of hot sauce it's a go to for sure. Trying to eat at that one most often due to their construction just because they are a really great location. Back entrance is open always!"}
{"text":"Update #3!  This time we went in for lunch.. As always got the normal order of Hummus and Tabbouli for an little appetizer.   Next on the hit list was, of course, the always phenominal Lentil Soup, just as good as my fiance's grandmothers!  Today I tried the Aladdin's Salad for a change of pace and a little bit lighter of a lunch.  It was fresh, flavorful and filling!  Service was very quick for lunch without feeling you are being rushed out the door.  The manager even came by to ask how everything was shortly after the waiter followed up.  I thought this was nice, because it seems like the manager is very engaged in the front of the house, and is starting to recognize us."}
{"text":"On a particular Sunday afternoon, part of me was resisting the urge to get Chipotle yet again.... the part of me that screamed, \"No! Get something healthy!\" If you're familiar at all with the Fairlawn area... despite the fact that there are a myriad of chain restaurants, it really is a food desert. With the exception of Mustard Seed Cafe and maybe a few others, it's all burgers, pasta and sushi, and very few quick takeout options except fast food. After weighing my options, I decided to resist the urge to go to Chipotle yet again, and give Aladdin's a go.   My associations with Aladdin's always rested with the downtown one on carnegie, but this location is a departure from the downtown one. For one, the downtown one doesn't serve a full menu, and there is very little seating. This location's inside is quite large, it kind of reminds me of a Panera, except there is table service instead of counter service. The menu is absolutely massive, there is everything from a variety of smoothies and juices, to salads, to pita wraps, to platters to a huge dessert list. You'll notice immediately that the prices seem a bit high for this type of restaurant, about $10-$14 per entree, but I will say that the portions are pretty generous, especially if you get the platters.   I ended up ordering a bowl of lentil soup ($3.95) and the Aladdin's Favorite Combo (about $13). The lentil soup was fantastic, I expected it to be creamy stewed lentils as you often get, but this was actually a broth based soup, loaded with veggies and super flavorful. I would definitely get this again, or try their other soups. The combo platter was a great choice, it was served with a mix of three proteins (grilled chicken, steak and lamb) along with brown rice pilaf and some greens on the platter as a side salad. The meat was grilled perfectly, very juicy and flavorful The rice pilaf wasn't anything like you normally get a restaurants, often dry and miserable, instead, this was really fluffy and complimented the rest of the platter well. The salad was a perfect addition, topped off with the Aladdin's dressing made with oil and spices. I also can't neglect to mention the iced tea- if you're a fresh brewed iced tea lover like me, you'll appreciate the tea here, as very few places make it as strong and properly made like it is here.  The short of it was that this is the perfect place to go for a healthy meal to get when you don't want to feel like you're depriving yourself. It's filling, tasty and you can easily split the portion into two meals. I sort of wish they had a lunch menu so the prices could be a bit cheaper though. This place would also be great for vegetarians or vegans, as all of their menu options are labeled according to dietary restrictions, and they have plenty to choose from whatever your dietary need."}
