{"text":"Had a meatball sandwich.  Quite good, homemade meatballs.   Need to try the dogs, next time."}
{"text":"This place is simple. Which isn't always a bad thing. Except they couldn't even get their main feature right. It seemed like they don't get much business. Which explains why my footlong hotdog was beyond charred...  I didn't notice until I was long gone, or I would have asked for my $4 back. This wasn't some grill marks. This was burnt solid crust dust. It ran the entire 12 inches, meaning it must have been sitting on the same side for multiple hours. Crusty, dried out nasty stuff. Ruined the entire thing. Had to throw it out.   Hard pass."}
{"text":"This is my third trip here. I have always found the owner and staff friendly and helpful. I prefer my hot dog well done and loved that my first was done so. Second I was less impressed with as I would have preferred it more well done; however when given a special request for a well done dog they delivered. Would recommend to all. Great establishment"}
{"text":"Mr. Beaner's has the finest wieners in town. I got the kielbasa with sauerkraut and it was made just right. You can get a good deal by choosing any sandwich, a drink, and a side of chips for $6. The workers are very friendly and welcoming. This place is perfect if you are sick of the typical chain fast food and want to try something different. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this spot a few more times as I love a good hot dog.  The last three hot dogs I have had here all were very good.  Cooked well and topping portioned very well.  It's nice to see they have created some speciality dogs which are appealing.  I tried to Coney Island Dog which was chili, cheese and onion.  Exactly what I would expect it to taste like.  Service has been fast and friendly.    It's still difficult to enter during the day as twice I had to turn around and approach from the near side of Saltsburg.  I still feel they need to make the parking lot a bit more inviting as there is not much room to dine inside.  I could see them working this into a Sonic type setting where you are waited on in your vehicle however, I think the simpler the better.    Price is not bad for a combo.  Footlong speciality dog, large, heaping portion of fries and drink for 9 and some change.  I'm going to pass on the fries as it's just not their thing.  Whoever said these fries resemble Potato Patch fries is nuts!  First off I do not think they are using a Soy based oil like Kennywood, but I could be wrong.  It was hard for me to tell because the fries were burnt.  I think this is from half cooking, not changing the fryer grease, not filtering each day but most likely a combination of all above.  The fries taste burnt and almost bitter.  Been like this every time I have ordered them.  I think they would be better off with a homemade chip or tater tot and cut the price.    Overall, a good dog and they finally have clamshells for their footlongs so they are not served rolled in paper anymore.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"As I mentioned in my original review, staff was super friendly and helpful. The menu is short and sweet, cost effective, and hits the spot for even the most pickiest eaters. I had the Kielbasa (juicy and tasty), and other members of my family ordered the Footlong hot dog (a hit with my 4th grader), and the Hot Sausage (not extremely hot for those used to spicy foods it's a mild) nevertheless very tasty. It's a good option for a last minute dinner option on the way home."}
