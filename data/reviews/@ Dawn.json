{"text":"Went here for breakfast this morning to check it out....cute decor! I had a vanilla latte and a mocha latte for my bf, both were delish! Pancakes were so cakey and sweet and the SEC was savory. Will def come back to try other items but so glad a good brunch joint has come to this side of town"}
{"text":"I just went by my FAVORITE breakfast place just to see it was no longer there!:( Closed for good!? Someone please tell me they have just relocated! This place was awesome!"}
{"text":"The food was really tasty, service was nice but as we entered radio was blaring. We asked that it be turned down and we were accommodated but towards the end of our breakfast another employee showed up and blasted the radio. Very rude. So we left. Even though the food was good, we won't be back. So if you like noise while you are trying to eat and hold a conversation with friends, this is the place for you. In addition, the website could be a little easier to use. We were looking for a Yolk, not realizing the name was @Dawn. 4 of us made this mistake."}
{"text":"Fell in love with this place while on a business trip. The oatcakes are unbelievably good. Staff is super nice and attentive"}
{"text":"Wonderful find!  Great food and service.  Love the ambiance too.  We will be back.  Ordered Wake 'n Bake and had them scramble Gouda with my eggs.  Yum."}
{"text":"Stop reading this review and go eat!!! Everything was delish! Service was fast and pleasant. Everything we ordered was piping hot and tasted incredible. We will be back and will bring everyone we know with us!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that I've found a breakfast gem! I absolutely love grits and for the first time I tried their delicious grits topped with bacon gravy, pork rinds and pickled watermelon. I know what you may be thinking but the combination was nothing short of amazing!! Great location too! Most definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Had the BEG biscuit!  So delicious and the biscuit was cooked perfectly!   The service was great and  the sweet tea was good!"}
{"text":"Service was good.... eggs a bit salty and pancakes were tastey but a bit crumbley(prob not a word) I was surprised at the amount of salt in my egg whites. Wish the were clean. Fruit looked as if it were frozen and thawed. Tasted just ok. Overall It was ok, but probably not a spot I'll rush back to."}
{"text":"Yummy pancakes!  The homemade sausage is good but too salty...tone that down a bit and you'll have a winner! I'm not really a pancake fan either, so to rave about these says a lot.  Go!"}
{"text":"The food was nothing special. The pancake and eggs I had made me wish I just made it at home."}
{"text":"What a great find! Locally sourced  ingredients, thoughtful and unique flavors, a friendly and welcoming place. This is my new go-to breakfast spot. We ordered off the special menu: blue cheese biscuits and beef gravy with deer tongue lettuce (side of poached eggs) also veggie benedict with purple squash sweet & white potato hash broccoli greens & fried kohlrabi. Nice to have a place to eat that breaks out of the chain restaurant menu. Looking forward to my next delicious visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast. Friendly and attentive staff, everything is made or order, coffee is great and they've got vegan options for those non-meat eaters. Fruit with basil mint was so good!"}
{"text":"I was excited to come here because of the reviews I had been reading, however the service didn't stand up to what was expected. I got there and it was only one other table who was already eating, so I thought it wouldn't take long. We were told someone was going to take our order and that person was sweeping and just continued to sweep. It took about 15-20 mins to have my order taken.   Once I ordered the food wasn't bad at all the eggs were cooked really nice not overcooked or under cooked and the pancakes were really good! I think that was the highlight of my visit. I would probably not put this in my rotation of breakfast places but if I want some good pancakes I would come back.  If the service was better I would have given another star. It's not bad but not great either!"}
{"text":"The best place to get breakfast on this side. Great authentic food, nothing here taste basic."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The sausage is made in house, the eggs were cooked perfect, pancakes were chewy and sweet like they should be, didn't even need syrup!  The coffee was great!  Normally restaurant coffee is weak, but this was bold and flavorful!  The atmosphere is colorful and inviting.  Service was excellent!  Go here and eat, you won't be disappointed, unless you're just one of those people that bitch about anything and are never pleased."}
{"text":"The food is cooked fresh, no wait at mid morning.  BEC is very cheesy and brioche bun was a nice touch, the sweet pepper jelly was the perfect complement to this item.   Lots of options and daily specials.   Coffee has amazing choices.   Off the road hidden, go find it!!"}
{"text":"Hubby found @Dawn because of their affiliation with the Yolk in Rockhill. We visited the Yolk a couple months back and Loved it. This place has that same quaint, cozy and down south home feel. When we arrived it wasn't packed so we were sat relatively quickly. We were greeted by the staff and someone came over to take our order right away. We decided to go for the chicken and waffles. The chicken wings were kind of small but were seasoned well and fried appropriately. The waffle was fantastic and a reasonable size. As for the menu us limited but has your standard breakfast entrees. There were a couple of snafus with the delivery of our food, more so a timing issue but the staff was quickly got it turned around. Overall I would return for breakfast or brunch. Solid place in a good location"}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid breakfast spot. I'd seen the signs for this place since they opened and was glad I could finally give them a try.   I walked in a little after 8 there wasn't anyone else in the place! I love it when I have the whole place to myself! I was greeted right away and took a quick look at the menu. Instantly I knew I wanted the BEG - I mean come on it has everything I love! Bacon, eggs and Gouda cheese. Sign me up!   I ordered it to go, and only had to wait about 5 minutes and I was out the door. But, by the time I opened my box I was a little disappointed. Not by the size of the biscuit because it was huge! But by the presentation. The biscuit had crumbled all up, the eggs and cheese were running over everything and I couldn't pick it up.   I ended up eating my sandwich with a fork and knife - I know, I know. But what choice did I have? Now, don't get me wrong the sandwich was good. I loved the flavor that the yummy Gouda added...but still it was total hot mess.   So here's a tip - if you can eat there.   I'd go back and give them another try. But I'd definitely  eat there and try something else off the menu. Just to switch it up.   So stay tuned for my update."}
{"text":"New local breakfast spot yay!! Eggs Benedict was spot on. Latte was large but didn't get me too wired. Prices are great. I can't wait to try out the rotating latte flavors like carrot cake! Parking is tight but plenty of seating inside. Decor was pretty cool. Supporting local they use local farms. Service was friendly and fast. A++"}
{"text":"Have enjoyed The Yolk and wanted to check out the sister spot. Overall the meal was tasty, music on point and service was pretty good. The server gets points shaved away for tepid first cup of coffee, not  introducing  herself and no mention of surcharge  for suggested  biscuit.  The biscuit was good,but would have been nice to have known it is an  extra 60 cents. Pancakes were delicious.  Shrimp and grits were tasty with the exception of an off-putting sweet undertone-maybe the pesto? Will order again minus the pesto.  All and all we liked the different  variety versus The Yolk and will alternate."}
{"text":"There were two empty tables and we were the only ones in line.  Two waitresses kept saying they would be right with us.  After looking around there were a few tables with frustrated people who had obviously been there awhile and didn't even have their drinks yet.  We stood there for 10-15 minutes and nobody sat us so we walked out.  Oh well!"}
{"text":"Wanted to just leave this here. I love the quiches and the way they get the texture, flavor and taste just right with the independent farm fresh ingredients and complimentary but ingenious pairings.  My definition of Art is...if I can do it, it ain't art. Well, this IS art."}
{"text":"Awesome food but get there early for the daily special or it will be sold out as was the case on my visit.  The special was rockfish, potato, and peppers over grits.....sounds amazing so I was so disappointed I didn't get to try it.  I instead ordered the shrimp and grits with a creole sauce and it was very good but I thought the grits were a tad too cheesy.  As a complete waffle snob, I couldn't leave without trying it and it exceeded my expectations.  It was perfectly cooked, with an amazing flavor, no box mix waffle here.  Already planning my next visit."}
{"text":"Meet chef/owner Greg C at a couple charity events prior to going to @Dawn. Good to know a local chef who believe in giving back and very involve in his own community. Also willing to do the farm to fork at his restaurant.  Today, I had the chicken and waffles. The waffles was sweet on its own where I didn't need syrup. Love it just the way it is.. The 3 wings that comes with it, is very well seasoned, crispy exterior and juicy interior., I'm a fan now. I also ordered a bowl of fruit with mint honey.. the mint honey balanced the acidic of the pineapple and the tartness of the strawberry. Well balanced in my opinion. Also have the caramel latte.. I definitely finish that.. very rare I order a latte outside of Starbucks but glad I did. Then wanted to try the sweet potato biscuit with smoked chicken gravy and pickled veg.. all very comforting.. the gravy works really well with the biscuits. And the pickled veg is actually thin slices of purple sweet potato..  Our waitress Kimberly was very sweet. She actually remember us from one of the event. Even remember \"The man\" have a seafood and nuts allergies. Girl got good memories. Overall she was on point. Nice smile and laid back personalities.  My water was filled. My breakfast spot to go now on."}
{"text":"hands down best breakfast place in charlotte.. breakfast sandwich was amazing.. french toast special is to die for..wishing they stayed open longer.."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food here.  Great place to eat.  The reason I can't give them 5 stars is that when I got my to go order just now I asked for some extra napkins besides the prepackaged cutlery and the young lady goes and you hear the sound of pulling paper from a dispenser and places paper towels in my bag.  Makes you wonder either about the restaurant or her laziness.  I am going to chalk it up to laziness. I was wrong it was nor the young lady' fault,  it seems the restaurant zdoes not have napkins...Hmmmmmm. It is the little things that a always bite you."}
{"text":"We were the first in the door this morning and were greeted warmly by a very attentive staff.  We both got the Wake N Cakes with eggs and bacon.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the pancakes are super tasty.  Really glad we came."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while, but sadly, they are closed on my days off!  Well I was off today and took full advantage.  It was worth the wait.  I had the quiche of the day, and it was fantastic, and for my side I had the curried sweet potato soup which was quite tasty.  My roommate had the BEG, and after a bite of her biscuit I knew I would be getting some biscuits to go!  The menu is small and well thought out.  For the people that said it takes a long time for your food to get there, go to Denny's, it will be out really fast!  It is an open kitchen, and you can see the work and the love that is being put in.  Food like this is worth waiting for.  Personally, I want tlc put into my meal.  When I cook at home I take my time and make sure it is a meal worth eating, and when I go out that is what I hope for as well.  I recommend this place highly for anyone that wants to try an exciting breakfast place.  I say exciting, because they have taken a traditional breakfast menu and made it fun and challenging.  I don't know when I will be able to eat here again because of my schedule and that makes me very sad.  Those of you that do not have my conflict should go there and enjoy a wonderful breakfast experience!  Thank you guys for having the integrity and passion for making this kind of business.  I hope that it will be as successful as you deserve.  I write a weekly blog called The Boozeletter and I will be featuring this place in it next week, because people need to know how good this place is."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of their sister restaurant in Rock Hill named The Yolk for a number of years and was excited to hear that had opened in Arysley. Problem is I like on Lake Norman and that a bit of a hike just for breakfast.  Problem solved. Had to drop my wife off at Charlotte Douglas Airport at 7am so she could catch here flight to Pittsburgh to see her grandkids in Pgh.  Not far from the airport so I dropped here off and headed to @Dawn.  Not as frenetic as The Yolk but it was explained to me that Saturday at The Yolk was more frenetic than the rest of the week and this was more common. Not very crowded but it was also explained to me that they are normally closed on Tuesday but because of being closed extra days during the Holidays, they had decided to open and even things out.  In anycase, was not crowed and when I walked in at 7:20am, I was told I could sit anywhere I liked.  Nice clean and new with a very clean and modern look and feel. Wall decorations are very eclectic and give a warm touch to the place.  My server could not have been nicer. I ordered coffee and I had a cup of fresh coffee on a serving tray almost immediately.  It was worth the trip here if only for the coffee. Very good. Rich and bold with great notes.  For Breakfast i ordered a ESC which stands for soft eggs, sausage and cheese served on Brioche with Red Pepper jelly.  Interesting medley of flavors with a lot of contrast that at the same time, compliment each other to create anunusual and tasteful combination.  The place is very Farm to Fork Oriented and only the best local ingredients are used.  A good addition to the Charlotte dining scene."}
{"text":"Service: We waited a good 5-8 minutes before the server greeted us and took our order. After ordering, it took 30 minutes for the food to arrive.   Menu: A bit limited, and they nickel and dime\" you for everything. Bacon, egg, cheese biscuit $5.99 + $1.00 to add onions -- $7.00 for a biscuit (really?).  Food: I ordered the bacon, egg and cheese biscuit. He order the pancakes, eggs and homemade sausage. The two pancakes were good, but small--he ordered two more because he was still hungry.  After 15 minutes the additional pancakes were still not out, so we cancelled them. The sausage was mediocre. I ordered my eggs with onions and they were good. The biscuit was tiny and crumbly --I had to use a fork and knife because the biscuit would have fallen into my lap.  All-in-all, It wasn't bad, but there are too many other good breakfast spots in Charlotte to add this to our breakfast rotation."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to coming here due to reviews, but service was terrible. Waited too long for chicken and waffles, then when it came out, we were disappointed to see 3 wings and a folded soggy waffle in a small plate. It definitely didn't feel like I was eating a $13 dollar meal. I could have eaten at a fancy Terrace Cafe for that price and a huge portion since it's my usual order. The coffee cost $6 dollars and it wasn't anything fancy. Basically paid for a $40 dollar breakfast and only worth half that. Will not come back again."}
{"text":"I had heard about at dawn and was excited to visit it. I finally got the chance the other day and took my mother-in-law for a brunch. I was less than impressed with pretty much everything at this location. The wait staff was inattentive and did not check back very often. The woman that appeared to be the owner or manager wandered around the restaurant attempting to give the wrong meals to the wrong tables. The coffee I ordered at the beginning of my mail didn't come till the entree came and was lukewarm. The entrees were less than impressive and very overpriced for the amount that we got. On top of all this, the music was exceptionally loud and did not seem to fit the motif of the restaurant. I am kind of surprised that they are still in business, and would not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Not busy when we arrived. Service was ok. Food was ok. Prices weren't compatible with what we received."}
{"text":"The food @Dawn is always delicious. I tend to stick with the tried and true classic of QCB, because it's my favorite!  The eggs are always well seasoned and the TN fries will make you happier than a day at the beach. Honestly, they are THAT good! Tried the Chicken and Waffle special this week and man, oh, man! Those wings were crispy and seasoned well and the waffle was better than any I have ever tried. The coffee is always spectacular and the service is always with a big smile.  If you haven't tried @Dawn, go tomorrow morning! You will probably end up going every week like we have!"}
{"text":"Disappointing unfortunately.  The menu was too  limited for a breakfast place.  Unable to even get french toast or a waffle, as they don't serve french toast and waffles are not on the la carte menu.  Also, the bacon tasted funny, and way overpriced for the food portions."}
{"text":"Man, I really hate to do this since I like The Yolk, but after two visits to @Dawn, I'm just not impressed. Since my first visit, they've updated the menu to actually be understandable, which is great, but the rest just wasn't.  The fella and I arrived around 8:30 on a Sunday, and there were maybe 2 or 3 groups already seated. We stood at the door for 3-4 minutes before anyone acknowledged us, even though there were staff right behind the bar. Even though the sign said wait to be seated, a woman finally told us to just seat ourselves.  I ordered a decaf coffee, which took a good 15 minutes to arrive since they hadn't made any yet. It took almost that long for the fella to get his OJ. For breakfast, I ordered the QCB, which was two eggs, toast, and a side - I went with bacon. The scrambled eggs were pretty puny, and the bacon was small, chewy, and overcooked. The toast was fine, but they only brought one packet of jam for 4 pieces; I asked for more, and it took forevvvver to get. The fella ordered one of the daily specials - the meat quiche. Instead of looking like quiche, it was a piece of sourdough bread with a sauce of meat on top. Super weird, small, and not very meaty. He got a side of grits, which were runny... not a knock on the grits since some people like runny, but he's a thicker grit kind of guy.   Oddly enough, two guys who came in after us and sat at the bar got their food way before we did.  By the time we left, the place was packed, and it looked like the staff was struggling to keep up."}
{"text":"Visiting for business and found this excellent breakfast spot. Very friendly and attentive waiters. Got a vegetarian omelet with sauteed greens, cheddar, and caramelized onions. Perfectly prepared and cooked just right. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We are currently searching for apartments in Charlotte and stopped here for breakfast! Definitely the best homemade breakfast. Everything tasted fresh and hot. We have found a spot that we will be frequenting when we move here in a few months. The pancakes are to die for! So mouthwatering! And the cappuccino is beyond delicious. Everyone was super friendly and it wasn't that expensive. Love love love it!"}
{"text":"I modified the breakfast sandwich, it was the best bfast sandwich ever. Brioche, soft fried, Gouda and grilled onions.  My SO got the veggie bene and says it was an original flavor that was extremely pleasant, like when Harry met Sally, but not just an act. We split the Tennessee fries, no ketchup needed. The 2x espresso was the only thing I could rail against, the clear cup should have mineral water, not tap water, still it was a five star meal."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. And I hate to write this place off, because I wanted to love it, due to it being within walking distance. But me and none of the people I know will eat here,after the experience we just had!!! Let me list it out for you folks....  I got the ham and bene, my \"go to\" judgement item on a breakfast spot. Something that even a hole in the wall diner can't even mess up. But boy will this place fool you with the pictures, what I got was a greasy english muffin with ham seared to the driest point known to man kind. Loaded with a poached egg in what I consider salt water, that is saltier then the seven seas. And the hollandaise was just as salty and bad.   The sever tried to be nice at the get go. But after waiting 30 mins for food in a mostly empty place and getting served salty food. My friend got shrimp and grits also said it was too salty and his was cold and there was barely any shrimp drowned in a burnt tasting salty spicy sauce.   The sever did not ask us how the food was, i guessing because of the look on her face at the quality of he food she dropped off and ran away from the table so promptly.... she could tell that we would be disappointed. Afterwards we leave and there was no goodbye from the staff. I really should have complain to management. But it just seemed as the staff did not care about our experience. So all and all we will make sure that no one we know will eat here. Our bill was $40 for two people. I want my money back."}
{"text":"Everything was super fresh from the orange juice and my sandwhich, great service., everything melted in my mouth, my new fav place for brunch., you won't be let down"}
{"text":"An absolutely first rate Carolina breakfast joint.  It looks like Whole Foods.  It has vegan options.  Don't be deceived.  This is a full-fat full-flavor pork-is-the-king-of-meats establishment.  Their home made sausage is simply superlative.   I have had a decent amount of Carolina breakfast meat - and while nearly all of it is good -   @ Dawn's sausage simply takes spiced ground pork to a whole 'nother level.  The bacon itself is just typical Carolina bacon - which is always good stuff.  The bacon cooking here, however, is totally superior.  They accomplish the neat trick of getting a good char on the edge of the bacon, cooking the middle enough to get the grease out but not cooking it so much as to kill the flavor of the bacon fat.   Most kitchens don't do this - so I was quite pleased to see bacon done right.  Grits are creamy.  Greens are bitter.  That means that God is in his kingdom and all is well with the world.  The vegetarian in the party loved her tempeh and pickled vegetable breakfast sandwich.  ***  One word to the wise about @ Dawn.  Don't let your eyes get bigger than your stomach.  Food here is substantial and rich.  A small plate will fill you up a long way.  Your mouth will be delighted ordering all the options -  but if you do that -   you won't be able to eat again for three days.  If you don't eat for three days,  how are you going to write your next Yelp Review?  But at least you will be happy you wrote this one."}
{"text":"sandwiches- good. Potatoes/home fries? Unbedernlievable. The seasoning (which is for sale when it isn't sold out) is amazing. Oh - and the sweet tea is right. Sweet and strong-not just sweet. Oh- and the music! Neo-soul/smooth clean hip-hop...crazy diverse mix of folks...Spot is like a dream come true."}
{"text":"Sunday Breakfast with my wonderful husband!!! A Chinese takeout restaurant stood here MANY Years ago. I couldn't find any decent breakfast/brunch places nearby. I've been waiting to visit Dawn for a while...I think they just opened.   I believe the hours are from 7am-2pm.... We arrived around 10am. No wait time. The tables seat about four people. There's also seating available at the bar. Needless to say this place is rather small, but not cramped   The menu doesn't offer a wide selection, which I appreciate!! Prices are inexpensive.   I ordered the Wake-N-Cakes, which come with two Pancakes, 2* Eggs and a side of bacon. I always say the best pancakes never require syrup! I also ordered a large orange juice ($3-$4) No free refills !!! My husband had two eggs with toast and bacon. We definitely enjoyed everything. I wouldn't mind coming back here."}
{"text":"The staff at this place is so friendly! I ate here on a slow morning and decided to eat at the bar. Casey was attentive and chatted about different things while my food was being cooked. I ordered a vanilla latte and the chicken & waffles.  The latte was served in a huge mug and was so delicious. The chicken and waffles were good! The chicken was fried perfectly. I didn't care for that batter too much. The waffle was amazing - so light & fluffy! I'd definitely get a waffle a la carte next time. I plan on returning and trying one of the biscuits. I've heard good things about them.   This place also has daily breakfast specials which is a rotating item that isn't on the main menu. Apparently, the french toast is amazing. I'm going to keep a lookout for it.  Good food, nice people - I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Came to visit my daughter & we were looking for a breakfast place. Went in, was greeted by very friendly employees. I had the mild coffee, it was very good. Had the quiche with a side of yogurt & granola. My daughter had two eggs, turkey sausage & pancakes. Everything was very good & the service was great! We would definitely come back again! No complaints here!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!! Farm to table concept delivered to your table with a price tag to satisfy any foodies budget. Quality, inventive menu options that are very delicious."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed going here for breakfast; good eggs, tasty coffee and super soft moist pancakes. The only thing I recommend is that they change the smoked buttermilk biscuit to just a buttermilk biscuit. I truly love biscuits but the smoked buttermilk just wasn't tasty. I ended up finishing the pancake but totally left the biscuit. Please bring back a normal biscuit without the smoky flavor!"}
{"text":"I saw the sign and was excited to find a new breakfast spot so tried it the very next Sunday.  It's in a super tight parking location, but once you're inside the colors are soothing and it really does feel like a cozy neighborhood breakfast place.  I was a fan.  The service was where it went off the rails for us.  There weren't many people there yet our waitress couldn't keep our coffee cups full.  I will say that the oatmeal cakes with pumpkin spice butter are delicious and heavy...  I could only eat one.  the Tennessee fries are simply fingerling potatoes roasted and coated in season salt.  They're not exactly what I want with my eggs.  The toast arrives piping hot but dry so you have to remember to butter it immediately upon arrival so the butter will melt.  They played loud soul music which was oddly soothing as a breakfast accompaniment.  It was over $40 (including tip) for 3 people to have basic eggs, toast, side and drink.  I think I'll go back another time or two, but it's not something I'd make a regular in my life."}
{"text":"My husband and I were hoping we found our \"after church Sunday breakfast\" spot since we live and worship in this area...after 2 visits, the search continues.   Both times it seemed like it took a rather long time for our food to arrive. In addition to that, there was a wait to get acknowledged only to be told \"you can sit any where\"...after standing for about 4, 5 minutes. If that is the case, please change the sign to \"seat yourself\".   The 1st time I ordered the Camelback. I'll admit, I may not have the most sophisticated palate but the combination of ingredients didn't work for me (thumbs down). However on my 2nd visit, the SEC was a hit. That sausage and pepper jelly, toasted bun...on point!      I do love that it's a husband and wife operated restaurant, I like farm to table concept and the music. Overall though, I won't be adding this to my list of go to places."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place cause it was right down the street from our hotel. Actually it was within walking distance so that's a plus. Chicken & Waffles were surprisingly better than I expected! My wife's 5K breakfast wrap was very good as well. We'll definitely be back next time we're back in the Charlotte area..."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible, I have never experienced anything like it.  10 am Saturday morning we walked in.  There were 3 open tables and 3 counter seats open.  There was a couple waiting to be seated and a couple with one child waiting to be seated.  I don't know how long they had been there but we all stood there for 10 minutes with no acknowledgement at all, nothing.  The first couple left and another came in.  After several minutes they left too, still zero acknowledgement by man bun or the other two servers who were chatting with seated customers.   Two more groups came in a couple minutes later......still not a word or a glance from staff.  We left.   That's 6 customers lost in 20 minutes.  Man bun and the rest of the staff are complete holes.  I cannot believe the absolute rudeness of this staff and disregard for customers.    Do not waste your time by going there."}
{"text":"At Dawn the staff are wonderful quick and courteous food is amazing the grits are true Southern grits great flavor season perfectly. I love the blueberry tea! The house cured and smoked bacon is amazing!"}
{"text":"I give this place a four for the food and a three for the table management. I believe they could easily maximize the space and take on more two seater tables if they could just crank out the food and wait service faster. The wait for a table is too long for short order breakfast food. But, I have to give it to them that their food is an authentic breakfast I've not had anywhere else in Charlotte yet and it's very worth eating here if you can get past the uncoordinated wait. I had a blueberry French toast that was nothing short of wonderful. In addition, I sampled the breakfast potatoes which were the BEST I've had in the city due to the delightfully spiced coating.  The eggs and grits were pretty spot on as well. It rivals any top diner in the city on taste for breakfast. Plus, their focus on locally grown and organic food is very commendable.  I Highly recommend going early and beating the 10AM and later crowd. It's well worth it if so. If not, don't show up near 10AM starving or you will have a 30+min wait of staring at people who have only received drinks as your entertainment.  I'll be back to @dawn....before 9AM on the weekend. ;-)"}
{"text":"The TN fries were amazing, as was the bold coffee. I had the bacon, egg and Gouda cheese sandwich on a biscuit. It was delicious! I will be back."}
{"text":"First the good:  The food was worth the wait!  I ordered the Vegan Grain Bowl.  Really good.  Nice little spicy kick, which I love!  Sweet cantaloupe sauce on top.  Texas Pete on the table - so I added it bit more spice.  The coffee:  excellent.  Now the bad:  nobody working there had any real sense of urgency to provide excellent service, even though I explained upon entering that I was tight on time.  There were only a few other customers in the place, and it seemed like it was taking a long time for them them to get their food, too.  It took over 20 minutes for my bowl to come out - but evidentially, I was the only person concerned - even after reminding the waitress I was tight on time.  The food was really good - I wish I could have savored it a bit more - but I had to wolf it down to stay on schedule.  In a hurry? - save this spot for another time..."}
{"text":"We were visiting a friend who lived nearby and suggested we have breakfast here. The service was very friendly and the food was fresh and delicious. The only negative is that it took quite a while for us to get our food compared to other breakfast places. It wasn't even that crowded. Simple egg and toast orders shouldn't take too long."}
{"text":"New spot for breakfast that I love.  Excellent food quality!  I got the farro grain bowl, although a bit small but it was very delicious and nutritious.  The pancakes were definitely better than average.  The egg whites are awesome!  I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of brunch."}
{"text":"Amazing SEC breakfast for me and BEG with extras for my son.  OJ was pricey but worth it and the vanilla lattes yummy!!  Love the white board (VOL fans unite).  Will be back when I'm in CLT next!  Worth the 15 min drive from the airport - much faster on the return (commuter rush was over)."}
{"text":"RUN TO THIS PLACE!!!!  We found this gem on the way to the Outlet. Almost didn't find it, but so glad we did!! It's very quaint and cozy. Coffee is the best I've had in Charlotte AND MY HOUSE!! Get the bold blend. We ordered breakfast off the suggestion of the server. I got the SEC sausage, egg, cheddar and red pepper jelly on a brioche roll. OH. My. God. Eggs perfectly cooked, housemade  sausage perfectly seasoned, cheddar oozing out, and red pepper jelly that's not hot, but has a little kick and sweet enough to offset the deliciously salty sausage all on a soft brioche roll that wasn't too doughy or bready. Baldie had Camelback which is eggs, smoked onions , Peppers, red chili chicken with Tennessee fries in a wrap. He said it was incredible. This is by far the BEST breakfast  we've ever had in North Carolina and possibly in New York, but you never heard it from me. I swear, I'm thinking about that friggin sandwich right now. Please go. Trust me, I know my food. I'm Italian and from New York."}
{"text":"Waited over 10 minutes just to be greeted at the door (mind you this is a very small place so not like we weren't seen) then told someone would be with us shortly. 10 minutes later someone comes up to us & says she'll seat us soon. We get seated and no one takes our drink orders for another 10 minutes and then says \"you ready?\" We repeadidly watched the line coming in the door and people going through the same 10 min wait to be greeted. There were tables open which was the strange part. Many people just left. Our food came out and was very cold. We will not be back and do not recommend."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of The Yolk, so I was excited to see they were opening another place. We got there around 1:30 and had missed the morning rush. The menu was creative and different. I also like that it isn't an exact duplicate of The Yolk. It's different and has its own flair. There were some great specials and a ton of coffee/espresso options.   My fella ordered the BEG (bacon, egg, and gouda biscuit) and TN fries. I went with the shrimp and grits special. We both loved our food! It was fresh, flavorful and served piping hot. The portion sizes were huge and neither of us could finish our food. Our server was friendly and kept our drinks filled.   We are looking forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"I instantly fell in love with this place. Walk in & wait to be seated. I was greeted as soon as I walked in  the atmosphere is casual and relaxed. I was seated but couldn't see the specials above the bar on the chalkboard. No big deal, I got up and went to see it. I opted for the wake n bake (or maybe bake N wake, not positive) but it was two pretty good sized pancakes, eggs cook to your preference, and 2 pieces of sausage, bacon or turkey bacon. I opted for eggs scrambled with Gouda cheese and turkey bacon. (Perfect!) my food came pretty quickly and tasted delicious! Very much pleased. Get this, they have two blends of coffee, mild and bold. I went for mild. It tasted great. The waitress brought my check while I was still eating, (which I like so I never feel pressured into dessert at dinner) $14. I felt like this was very reason for the tastiness of the food, service and overall experience. Julia made sure everything was perfect. The moment my water was close to low, she was on it! Needless to say, I will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere and the service is excellent! Love their flavor combinations! Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot.  The oat cakes were delicious - didn't even need syrup. We also had the SEC sandwich and the chicken & waffles which were equally great.  Also, nice robust coffee.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Breakfast for lunch... yes please! I've been a huge fan of The Yolk Cafe, but to be honest it's too far off the Charlotte beaten path to make it my regular brunch spot. Thankfully owners Greg and Subrina have opened @Dawn in the Ayrsley area. This sister restaurant features a relatively simple menu without loosing the great concepts of locally sourced products and those amazing Tennessee seasoned fries (eat your heart out Bojangles!).  We stopped in for a look see to carbo load before tackling the WWRC bike trails, ordered the BEG and SEC breakfast sandwiches. BEG = bacon egg gouda, SEC = sausage egg cheddar. Both were on point, but the favorite of the table was the SEC with red pepper jelly elevated this breakfast sandwhich to a new level."}
{"text":"Oh, my. The bacon egg and cheese biscuit was off the charts excellent. A perfectly fried egg, melty cheese and a bunch of bacon on top of a biscuit unlike any that I've enjoyed before. Different and a little grainy and very, very buttery. Delicious.  Coffee was strong and quite wakey-upey. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Despite the server getting my order wrong, the food was delicious. I had the 5k wrap which I had requested come with sausage instead of turkey bacon (it came with the turkey bacon. Yuck). When I told the server he looked at me with a blank stare and just said \"Oh....\" And didn't even apologize. I just had the him bring me some sausage patties to mix in with it as I ate, bc I didn't want to wait for them to make a whole new one. Anyways it had some sort of sauce on top and was delicious.   So besides the awkward server, my only other comment to the owners is that menu is hard to read and understand. Not well designed."}
