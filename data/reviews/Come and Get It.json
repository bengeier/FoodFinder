{"text":"Sigh, Come and Get It has lot \"It\". First Peter left so we lost his great, fun, caring service, and now the menu has changed from small to medium snacks to just meals (wraps, salads) and a token slider and mini poutine. We had the horrible pork souvlaki. It was massively dried out, and when complained to the service, he agreed. Why he brought out sub-par food was the question left lingering in the air. 10% tip and we won't return. Sad, we've been hanging out for a long time at 676 Queen St. W."}
{"text":"Whether solo for lunch or in a big group, Come and Get It has always been great.  I have had outrageous requests and huge orders and they've always been quick and perfectly made."}
{"text":"What an awesome new spot to grab some drinks and bites. I can't wait to come back when the weather is warm and the front window is open!

Came here last night with a girlfriend after having frequented the old location for lunches and loving the food. 

Setup for evenings is different. Same flavours as the old CAGI with a few delicious new options. Post-lunch formats are snack, slider, mini poutine, flatbread, bag o bites. Make sure to ask your server about how each of these are presented, they are very informed and each option is quite different. Eg. Chipotle short rib snack is served on seared polenta with coleslaw, fried chicken snack is on a jalapeño cornbread muffin. YUM. 

Between the two of us we had 2 snacks each (I had mango jerk chicken and fried chicken) and shared 2 mini poutines (short rib, coconut shrimp). Everything was so well executed. You're getting high quality, chef prepared food with some delicious and varied drinks. This is not a restaurant this is a snack bar so come and try new things and enjoy the experience! 

I'll be back. Come and get it!!"}
{"text":"Top notch quality lunches. 

I love all of the sandwiches at CAGI but I tend to favour the Mango Jerk Chicken which is to die for, crunch from the banana chips, spice from the marinade and the aioli, sweet from the mango slaw. It's just the perfect balance all caught up between the chewy milk bread bun (drool).
I also love the braised beef shortrib sandwich for the crispy onion and tender tender meat.
My favourite salad is also the braised beef - such a surprise that this BBQ type pulled meat could be so awesome in a salad! It's the balance of the tangy goat cheese, rich meat, crunch onion, sweet balsamic reduction. Totally satisfying salad and more than enough to fill you up. 

I hope they move close by if/when the time comes!"}
{"text":"Dropped by for a quick bite and wasn't disappointed. Friendly staff and quick service. The bar is stocked with lots of great drink options, and some unexpected draught beer on tap!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time the other day. The food was great, I got the duck confit slider and the chipotle beef poutine, both fantastic. I also had the Moroccan Ale and that was very good too. My friend ordered a poutine that took a while to come out, the waitress came and apologized, the bartender / manager then came and said that he'll take the item off the bill, and within 5 minutes he gave us 4 shots on the house.

Haven't seen service like that in a while! 

The food is tapas style, and the place is great as stop on a bar hopping night. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a really cool place for quick bites and hangouts! Limited but interesting choice of beers on tap. Sliders highly recommended, tried the Mango Jerk, Fried Chicken, and Taco - all were amazing.

I would definitely stop by here again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"\"Restaurant Today, Condos Tommorrow. When? Who knows? so come and get it!\" This is literally the first thing I see on a sign walking into the restaurant. And I think it does a good job summing up Come and Get It! the newest grab-and-go sandwich joint at Spadina and Queen. Having only opened for just a couple months, it's fated to be turned into a Condo project sometime this year. I have it say its an unfortunate decree -- the food was great!

The place is very bright and uplifting, even coming during the evening. Half the walls are painted bright pink, while the rest are a refreshing white. Everything about this place screams hipster, urban, and effortless.

Next to the ordering counter is a picnic bench for more seating, and a wall displaying enough items to trigger a lengthy flashback of my own childhood. A boombox, an N64, and a boxy old CRT computer monitor? Just about sums up all the fun I had in the 90s!

The menu is simple and the two giant chalkboards hanging next to the cash registers explain it all. You pick what you want (short rib, pork belly, chicken caesar or green beans), and then what you want it on (sandwich, poutine, or salad) . 

Hawaiian Pork Belly Poutine ($7) - House french fries, mozzarella, cheddar cheese curds, slow roasted hoisin pork belly, crispy crackling, and a rich beef gravy
-comes with a couple long strips of pork belly, which had no shortage of fat on them. 
-loved loved loved the crackling and whole chunks of cheese curds
-the fries were delicious on their own: heavily deep fried so that even the last fry in the box was crunchy (despite all that thick hearty gravy)
-I think I could feel my cholesterol going up with every bite...but it's worth it!

Chipotle Beef Short Rib Sandwich ($8) - Braised beef short rib with Chipotle aioli, ancho chili BBQ sauce, crispy onions and a sweet and sour coleslaw on a milk bun
-everything on sandwich was thinly shredded, making it quite messy one to eat! 
-tender pulled short rib, pickled coleslaw that wasn't too sour, and crispy onions which gave the otherwise one dimensional sandwich some texture. 
-It could've used a bit more sauce on it, but definitely not a deal breaker for me.

Overall verdict? Nothing but love! The service is fast, and I would definitely not hesitate to come here for a quick work day lunch...that is if I can fight off the sleepiness consuming all that food! It's really shame that this place won't be here for very long. Guess we'll all just have to do as told, and Come and Get It while we still can! =)"}
{"text":"YAY FOR AWESOME POUTINE!

That's all I had here so I will review poutine. My husband had the one with pulled pork and I had the apple chicken ceasar.

They were both so good. You can tell that whoever created this food put a lot of thought into what they would want to eat cause its just downright yummy. You can't argue with it. AND ITS CHEAP!

It's an interesting place, not the best ambiance (VERY trendy) but I did love the communal table set up :)

I'd come back for more poutine!"}
{"text":"Come n Get it is so good. It's gourmet style food for at very responsible price. The vibe there is amazing and offers a cosy interior and a great patio.
The best thing about this place is the  staff is super friendly and personable. (To me that alone is worth my repeat business - the angry hipster thing has grow old - lol)"}
{"text":"This is a huge change from last summer's Spadina menu, so if that's what you want don't come! We came hoping for the savoury sandwiches that were my favourite and instead the menu was tiny, the food was tiny in size, the chips literally look like the crumbs at the bottom of a chip bag. We're pinching at tiny crumbs not chips! I would not come back here again unfortunately. Where did the big eats go?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! super friendly and accommodating staff, great service and the food is alway amazing. I recommend checking out the brunch menu."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Food is fresh. Expensive for what is served."}
{"text":"Went in for short ribs sandwich, side of poutine and a can of coke for $13

Tasty!

From what I've been told everything is biodegradable, not that I care just a neat perk to the restaurant

The apple slaw is quite tasty I must say as well as the crispy onions

Will try the other options on the menu next time!"}
{"text":"I have been here a good few times every time I'm in Chinatown area. The food has been very consistent and delightful. Too Bad Fellow Yelpers that this place is gonna TANK by October 25th!!!! So give them honour and praise for their delicious food and say good bye to whoever is replacing them. I know I am sure to miss this place when I have a poutine craving. They have really great pork belly, beef short ribs, jerk chicken. Don't miss out on this joint off your to eat list!!!"}
{"text":"As I stood reading the menu on the chalkboard, I must have looked puzzled because the guy behind the counter came over to explain how things work in this place.  I love the concept of picking either a sandwich, poutine or a salad with the various \"topping\" options.

I went with one of the daily specials: corned beef brisket in sandwich form.  It was a rather messy sandwich with a fresh crusty bun heaped with meat , if a bit on the fatty side...but I would way rather pick around the fat knowing that it's real meat  I'm eating as opposed to processed any day of the week.  The mustard cleared my sinuses nicely (as a good mustard should!) and was very flavourful.  Huge meal and very satisfying.

The communal style picnic tables are ideal for the lunchtime crowd when it's hard to find a seat since everyone is sitting alone at a table."}
{"text":"First, let me get this out of the way: this place is closing down at the end of October, and while it does make some incredible food, I don't think I'm going to miss it.  I am really happy I got to try it, and I'm going to talk happily about that Hawaiian pork belly sandwich to anyone who'll listen, but this place is really more of a once-in-a-while indulgence than a regular lunch spot.

The prices are high (the salads are now 9.50!), but the food is worth it, and I'm okay with paying a bit more for completely biodegradable packaging.  Service is fast and the servers are friendly.  The pork belly sandwich comes topped with a sweet barbecue sauce, purple coleslaw, and a few sad little pieces of pineapple, and all of it works really well with the heaping of pork.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Portions are absolutely minuscule.  I ate at the former location several times so when I was tipped off that it now had a permanent location I had to go back to get my fix.  Unfortunately while the general idea is the same the execution isn't there.   They've basically miniaturized all the food to maybe a quarter size portion while dropping the price maybe 10%.  

If you like tapas style restaurants where you end up ordering 10 dishes with a massive bill and are still hungry then you may not mind this place, but I try to avoid them at all costs (guu maybe being the one exception).  

Food taste is great, but they've mucked with the formula which made them so popular in the first place."}
{"text":"The place has a great atmosphere, very relaxed and with very friendly staff. The menu is small and simple but has something for everyone. The food is extremely good, and at a great value. 

The owner is so awesome that on a hot summer day in Toronto he handed me and my girlfriend a free freeze. I highly recommend the Jerk chicken sandwich, incredibly juicy with great spices including spicy mango."}
{"text":"They try too hard.

The restaurant is loud and has too much shit going on inside.

I had their beef cheek sandwich, which was the lunch special. I came in at 11:30, expecting it to be, you know, hot, since it's early. Nah, brah. It was kinda cold.

The beef itself was cooked very well, it was extremely tender, but the \"chili mocha mole\" sauce was neither chili infused nor was there any mocha mole flavour. It totally fell flat. Also it was a really unbalanced sandwich. You might get a bite of strong watermelon pickle which very tasty, but the other bites would be lacking flavour, and it just had a flavour profile of \"all over the place\". Sweet corn, mild beef, powerful pickle and an odd green sauce just... didn't add up to a good sandwich. Definitely not work $10. Maybe $3s, but even then, I'd opt to go for lunch elsewhere.

They *do* have Mario Kart on N64 available for you to play, which was pretty sweet. Other than that, this place tries harder than those hipster restaurants down in San Francisco."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been amazing, and I've tried most of the menu items! My only complaint is that the quantity of toppings/fillings seems to vary by visit. My go-to order is the chicken caesar sandwich and house-made iced tea. Service is really, really friendly - they greet you as if you're an old friend!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm only hearing about this place now!  I should have known I'd love this place when I saw a picture of Optimus Prime on the wall.  This place clearly has great taste!

I went with my friend for lunch and I ordered the braised beef rib sandwich.  The bread was fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  The perfect sandwich bun.   The beef was well seasoned and moist and was complimented well by the aioli and crispy onions.  Dare I say the beef was even more flavourful than my beloved Banh Mi Boys?  It got a bit messy, and the sauce began dripping down my hand, but i couldn't care less.  I just licked my hand and kept eating.  Many apologies to my friend as I kept cutting off what she was saying with exclamations of, \"Oh my gosh, this sandwich is amazing!\".  A couple of runaway fries made it into my container, but I didn't care.  They were delicious and crisp!  Part of me thinks CAGI snuck it in so I'd have a reason to come back next time.

For all your enviro-conscious yelpers, this place is also incredibly earth friendly.  All their napkins, containers, utensils etc are all biodegradable or recyclable.  An extra star for being green!"}
{"text":"Another taste of bits and bites, tapas loved it!! Amazing service and loved the presentation. The creativity in presenting the  sample is very satisfying, it amazing to see how the waitresses explain the ingredients in every items. Loved it ...worth going back!"}
{"text":"First visit. Went with the granny smith chicken caesar.

It was very good. Bun was super fresh, chicken was cooked perfectly, the sandwich wasn't dripping with sauce (had just the right amount so it wasn't overbearing or dripping all over the place) and the slaw on the side had a nice zing to it.

My lone complaint would be about the fries - they are good, but after eating a few I found they were too salty for my liking.

The staff was very friendly and welcoming, and the dude at the counter was checking in with people after they got their food to make sure it was OK.

The special on the day of my visit was soft shell crab.

Sandwich, fries and a canned drink combo was $11 before tax/tip. If you don't want a canned drink you can go with they iced tea they make. No complaints from me about the price.

Would love to see this place find a permanent location in the area."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. I'm by no means a \"foodie\" but I've always envied some of the cool innovative things our neighbours down south (NYC and LA typically) were doing. Pop ups, crazy food trucks etc. It seems finally Toronto is catching up. Come and get it is simple, cheap and delicious.

It won't be around for long, so you better go and get it :)"}
{"text":"Love the decor in this place. The 80's music in the background, the VCR with \"back to the future\" ready to play, and the nintendo 64 that we played smash brothers on, but there are several games out for the choosing.

The menu was simple, but the meals are delicate enough that they ask that you don't change it up. I had the jerk chicken salad, but the short rib poutine is calling to me for another day. Also tried the pumpkin and pear juice, which is so much better than it sounds."}
{"text":"Been here twice. It's a neat find and concept - everything is recyclable. 

Sandwiches we've tried:
Hawaiian pork belly - was ok
Jerk sandwich - lots of heat, very good!
Chicken granny smith - not that good, tastes like tuna for some reason
Short ribs - pretty good

Every sandwich comes with a light slaw. The fries were very good. Definitely go for the combo with fries. 

I ordered their freshly made iced tea where you add your own agave nectar to your liking. I could not get it sweeten at all - I don't even like overly sugar drinks. I'd skip on the special drinks...

Fun, casual place to try!"}
{"text":"It's like stepping into someone's basement, the place was sparely decorated and understandably so since it's temporary, but it's get the job done.

Inside you have some long wooden communal seating, shellac surfaces, hip hop music playing in background and bunch of memorabilia you'd identify with if you grew up in the 80s.
 
Foods was delicious though. Ordered a short rib sandwich and the chicken poutine. Meat was tender and flavored to a T. The fries on the poutine could be crisper.   
They make an effort to be green, from the paper to the containers, forks, and drinks containers are recyclable. 

I'd be back. It's gourmet street food on the cheap."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their food is fantastic and a refreshing retreat from the fast food chains that are starting to dominate the Queen and Spadina intersection. The decor is colourful but minimalist and not overwhelming. I've had poutine and sandwiches there and have never been disappointed. They even have Fanta! This is a pop-up spot, so get there soon before it's turned into another condo."}
{"text":"I love love love the braised beef rib salad here (ask for sauce on side). The fried onions are delicious, the beef so tender and juicy, and just enough greens to think you're being healthy. Johnson checked in through the yelp app to add poutine to his sandwich order...which looked like a LOT of food...which I sadly can't eat on my diet.

You can't go wrong with anything on the menu here (I've only had them on salad). The owner is super cool and the place has wicked 80s/90s lunch boxes on the tables - NKOTB FTW! Service is also quick even through the busy lunch hour."}
{"text":"Best Poutine I've ever had and fresh Beaus Embitterment to wash it down. Deeelish!! Best Valentines brunch ever :)"}
{"text":"I love the ideas behind the menu and decor here. It's absolutely genius how each dish can be served as either a sandwich, salad, or poutine and still taste great either way it's served. The beef poutine is awesome. For something different try the pork belly in a salad.  My one complaint is I do think the portions could have more of the meat/main dish, for the price."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the tacos. They had a stand at the Harbourfront fest and I got the three different tacos. They were all pretty good, but my favorite was the bulgogi taco."}
{"text":"Tight space, but they've got a bar you can wait at and grab some hangover busters at. Food is really something else. Just became a new favourite !"}
{"text":"I get it. You guys are cooler than me. You know what you're doing. It's obvious.

First, nostalgia everywhere... N64 console, vintage iMac, Simpsons and Barbie lunch boxes, huh? Childhood? Where have you been?!

Second, the menu. Clear, concise, and to-the-point. What do you want (Sandwich, Salad, or Poutine) and how would you like it (Chipotle Beef Short Ribs, Hawaiian Pork Belly, Granny Smith Chicken Caesar, Herbed Crunchy Green Beans).

I cheated any loose form of diet and got the Beef Sandwich, Beef Poutine, and Caesar salad. All of them were quite tasty. The Caesar was particularly good. It was Topped with deep fried chick peas, shaved green apples, and a piece of chicken skin (salted and fried). Very clever. 

Definitely will get more. Please don't go!!"}
{"text":"They started off as a pop up shop on spadina at queen st and once they moved he had added brunch to his menu along with some other amazing treats and drinks. We sat down for Saturday birthday brunch for a friend and was not disappointed, the atmosphere is friendly the Caesar was amazing and the food was great. I had the ol El Paso taco and some side bacon, it was super yummy. Their salads are amazing too my fav is the chipotle beef salad and the jerk chicken salad. The jerk chicken has a nice kick to it! Glad to see this once pop up shop find it's own store front now!"}
{"text":"deep, deep, deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep lust for this place. I can't say any more because my words are pale and useless when describing the food here."}
{"text":"Had the Jerk Chicken Frittata
- house jerk chicken, red pepper, 3 egg frittata with cheese-tots and mango plantain side salad

Wish there were more chicken inside since the ratio of egg became too much. I found the chicken a bit dry as well.

The presentation looked promising though!"}
{"text":"Sigh. I really REALLY wanted to like this place. Sandwiches, near me, and a menu that looks great? What's not to like!

Alas, the food itself. Been twice (was hoping the first time was just a bad time), but alas no. Honestly, \"meh\" just describes it.

I can't even expand on it.

Oh, and it also took forever to come out."}
{"text":"When one of my girlfriends texted me to discuss a new poutine joint, the only choice I had at this point was to head on over and check it out. 

This pop up restaurant is pretty fantastic. I had the beef sandwich and a side of poutine. The fries were delicious, the sandwich was heaven and overall, this place gets two thumbs up from me. (If I had a third, that one would be up too). Their menu is simple and very user friendly.. There are technically 4 items on the menu but you can have it in three different forms: Sandwich, Poutine, Salad.... otherwise.... genius.

The restaurant itself is very eco- friendly. They only use containers that are gentle to the earth and they didn't jazz out the joint with crazy decor.  The guys working at Come and Get it are so incredibly friendly (not to mention handsome). 

I hope this pop up restaurant plants its roots firm because it would be shame for everyone one to not have the chance to come and get it."}
{"text":"Still gets the 5 star rating from me!

On my last adventure there, I opted for the short rib salad, which has caramelized onions, goat cheese and a balsamic reduction.  Can you say PHENOMENAL??!

The specials these guys whip out on Thursdays are so original, and unbelievably fantastic.

I hope people continue to go and support these guys who are truly passionate about what they do so they will open up a permanent location, as I don't know what I will do when that condo is under construction!

GO GO GO!"}
{"text":"I went and got it two days in a row.  Braised beef rib sandwich was pretty tasty.  Iced tea with the add-your-own simple syrup, nice and refreshing.  Pouting was a lot bigger than expected.  How does one person eat that??  Shared between two people, JUST manageable, very good beef rib meat (yes, I ate the same meat two days in a row).  Good thing the condo development is not on schedule.  I can go back and get some more!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Toronto!! This place seriously can do no wrong. I come here for brunch every visit because their chicken & waffles is unreal. Perfect bite size portions of juicy and crispy fried chicken over waffles with a fruit chutney smothered with fresh whipped cream and local maple syrup just can't be beat. I'm also obsessed with their ceasars--so deliciously spicy with homemade everything. One of my favorites in the city. Their snacky hour is also such a good deal--free bite size app per cocktail. Can't say enough about this place! Also love their throwback hip hop that's always on rotation :)"}
{"text":"Back in Fall 2012 I had their duck confit sandwich special - so good! We'll be back for more. I'm amazed its just a pop up restaurant. Will be sad to see it go if it hasn't already."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! Popped in for dinner with a friend on a Wednesday night and it was dead...mind you it was freezing outside (when will winter end?!) so we sat by the window and had a nice view of the passers-by slipping and falling :)

Staff: FANTASTIC. So nice and kind...since it was us and the table beside us, we got extra attention from both our waitress and the bartender. We were sipping on their old fashioned and he offered us a negroni to try (very very good!). I guess he was trying out some new recipes, and we got the benefits of it! He also walked us through the menu and how to order. Our waitress was very helpful with choosing which style to get with each flavour we were interested in. 

Drinks:
*Old Fashioned
*(insert adjective here: chatty, bossy??) ...girlfriend - I cannot remember the name of this drink but it was prosecco-based, wiith cucumber and basil. YUM

Food: Delicious! I love eating tapas style because you can go out for dinner and eat as much or as little as you want. We ordered as we went and shared some plates and had others individually - celiac over here didn't want to get in the way of some coconut shrimp sliders :)

1) Jerk chicken, poutine: Bomb. Just fantastic. I've never seen the size of the cast iron that they brought it out in..it's so tiny and adorable! It must be like 3 or 4 inches in diameter!! Great size for sharing. Skinny fries with delicious gravy and appropriately melted cheese (so key!) Jerk chicken (my fav) with jerk aioli ...wow.

2) Old el Paso taco, taco: This was the most adorable thing I've ever seen. It comes with 3 bite-sized tacos (think one-bite brownies). They were really good.

3) Hawaiian pork belly, snack: Seared pork belly and pineapple on a skewer. MMMM...I am not the biggest on mixing sweet flavours with anything, especially meat but this was great!!! 

...people beside us were getting the flatbread and it looked fab. I would recommend it, and it's quite a generous size!

I'll definitely be back, I think it would be a fun place to go for drinks too!"}
{"text":"We very much enjoyed our lunch at Come and Get It today. Lovely setting on Queen St W, with a backpatio that had plenty of light and well spaced tables. The service was attentive, and we wouldn't hesitate to return.

When you visit, you pick a base (burger, wrap, salad or poutine) and then a \"flavor\". She picked the Hawaiian Pork Belly + wrap, and it worked well. The pineapple fit surprisingly well with the pork belly, and the wrap was large. 

I picked Mango Jerk Chicken + Salad, which was delicious With a slight kick to the chicken, the shredded mango was fresh and flavorful.

We had the chance to order a side of poutine for $1, which is a steal, but I'm not sure I'd order it again. The fries were excellent: fresh cut, thin, blanched and twice fried, legit. Yet the homemade gravy was rather bland, and could have used more salt. Moreover, the two cheeses (orange cheddar and mozzarella) didn't work. There no excuse to have non-curd cheddar while serving poutine in Canada. 

So I'd go back, gladly, but would likely skip the poutine."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst breakfast I've had in years! It took over 40 minutes to get food in a hardly busy place. The eggs were well overdone, the bacon extra fatty and very salty potatoes. I left almost my whole meal and my partner left most of his. They did offer to make new eggs but it took 40 minutes to get the first round, I just couldn't sit much longer. Every single thing was badly prepared except the Caesars.  We were shocked when the bill arrived and they left both breakfasts on the  bill. Believe me, I don't need a free meal nor looking for one however when a customer is so displeased and leaves a basically full plate, telling the server she was going home to eat, any classy or business like establishment would have taken  at least one breakfast off the bill or something. It was galling to pay for terribly prepared food. I am a neighbour and would never return!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here and I found the food to be pretty average. Got the breakfast burrito with guacamole added, and my friend got the eggs benny with pulled pork. 

The breakfast burrito was plain and simple a breakfast burrito. Didn't stand out to much in terms of flavour. In fact, I doused it in the local No. 7 hotsauce to give it more of a kick. The potatoes were well cooked, but way too much salt. I had a bite of my friend's eggs benny and it was quite good! Egg yolk still liquid, and pulled pork was yummy. The cheese taters were nice too, although too salty as well.

All in all, a decent brunch experience. Didnt have to wait for a table (around 11:15am on a Sunday). And our server was fantastic.

As a side note, I tried one of Come and Get It's sandwiches at the union station market last summer, and I remember that the sandwich was delicious."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but my experience was less than stellar. Food portions were small. Service, while friendly was very slow and socially awkward. 

Their waffle iron had a malfunction causing me me to wait over half an hour for a buffalo chicken waffle sandwich, which would have been fine, but there was no communication from the kitchen. Chicken to waffle ratio was not great either, just a couple of popcorn chicken sized chunks sprinkled about.

Benny was instantly forgotten after leaving the restaurant."}
{"text":"\"If you want it
Here it is
Come and get it
Make up your mind fast
If you want it
Anytime I can give it
But you better hurry
'Cause it may not last\"

                                          - The Beatles

The days of young restauraunteurs are upon us.  Ironically, the chefs are getting younger too!  Come and Get It is the pop-up restaurant of Twitter-fame that now occupies the spot where Ackee Tree used to be.  But not for long, as a condo development is going up in the near future.  Its sad but inevitable, that  Come and Get It has joined the harem of restaurants (cue Bistro 990, The Real Jerk) that will be bulldozed and replaced with more condos.

The young man behind this funky venture is Jon Polubiec.  With the help of graffiti artist Skam, his brother, and a few friends - Come and Get It was born.  Due to time restraints, they had to get in and get open fast.  This meant all hands on deck to get all the grunt work done.  They didn't have time for hired hands; the light fixtures were decorated with leftover cans of spray paint, courtesy of Jon's brother.   But even if everything was rush, rush and go - I loved the restaurant's nostalgic interior.  Highlights include a vintage iMac circa 1998, a boombox and sneakers, a Nintendo 64, neon lunchboxes which would serve as a condiments tray and my favourite - the Optimus Prime poster from Jon's bedroom.  I loved the bright interiors!  Its so refreshing to see a restaurant with some character!

The menu offers 3 simple items: a poutine,  salad and sandwich with the occasional daily special announced via Twitter.   The matrix-style menu is quite easy to read - so combine them any way you want!  The 3 meat-packed flavours consisted of Chipotle Short Rib, Hawaiian Pork Belly and Granny Smith's Chicken Caesar.  On the vegetarian side, there is Herbed Crunch Green Bean.

The boys at Come and Get It know what they're doing.  All having worked in the food and restaurant industry, they're not just a bunch of kids looking to make a quick buck.  They pay attention to every little detail.  Down to something as  minor (but nonetheless important), as their choice of sandwich bun which was hardy enough to soak up the sauce from the Chipotle Short Ribs without turning into a soggy mess.  The accompanying coleslaw is one of the freshest I've had in Toronto, and the perfectly thin and crispy onions are delicious.

Granny Smith's salad just goes to prove that nana knows best.  It wasn't just another boring old salad.  Ingredients included thin slices of apple, crispy chicken skin, and fried chickpeas tossed with a creamy dressing and slices of shaved Parmesan.

Their poutine was no doubt a calorie-buster, but the cracklings and pork belly will overshadow any urge to log your meal into your My Fitness Pal app.

Verdict:

Go!  It is a cool place to hang out with a group of friends and you can hit up Queen Street West to do some shopping after.  The staff are friendly and the food is good. 

While owner Jon has Twitter to thank for its success, he still has trouble peddling in the local foot traffic - no thanks to the huge McDonald's at the corner of Queen and Spadina. Although they're technically signed in for a 1 year lease with a 30-day termination clause, they're confident they'll stick around for at least a few more months - and depending on the results of this test-drive, may even open up shop in a more permanent location.  Starting over again would be easy-peasy considering how fast they started their engines with Come and Get It.

It's also worth mentioning that their eating utensils are supplied by Green Shift.  An expensive but Earth-friendly alternative to plastic.

So if you're in the area, walk past the golden arches and try out some of the tasty goods at Come and Get It - and do it fast, before its gone."}
{"text":"I came here 3 weeks ago with my boyfriend on a Saturday night. 

We really enjoyed the place. Laid-back service, relaxed atmosphere, fair prices (about $13 for sandwich, fries and a drink) and tasty sandwiches! My boyfriend got the pulled pork and I got the chipotle beef short ribs. It was juicy and filling. It was also fun to see Archie comics on every table - a wave of childhood nostalgia. 

They were also closing and we were the only ones left but like I said, chill environment. They didn't warn us that they needed to close soon, nor rushed us.

This place is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from the guys at Banh Mi Boys.  They said the apple chicken ceaser sammie was the bomb.. but the day I decided to go, I wasn't feeling ceaser-ish, so I went for the jerk chicken poutine. Why poutine? I didn't need all those calories. 

First off it's huge. Enough to share fo sho.  My bf got the pork belly sammie and liked it.  The decor in this place is fun, easy and relaxed.  Long bar like tables with stools, and you can sit facing Spadina and people watch which I always love to do while eating.

The poutine was cheaper than the sammie, which I was surprised about. I will go back to try the recommended chicken sammie, but this place isn't on my OMG I must eat here list. I'll hit up Banh Mi Boys first for that wicked club bao."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned, there is no salad more perfect than a Caesar salad, and I'm always up for seeing how different restaurants interpret this classic.  On a whim one lunch hour, I decided to see how Come And Get It stacked up against other salads I have tasted.

Let's start with a warning: this isn't your grandmother's Caesar salad.  The proportions are monstrous, and even for a salad, it's quite filling.  In addition to the mounds of fresh, leafy romaine lettuce you'll find soft pulled chicken, crispy chickpeas, granny apple slaw, and to top it all off (in a move of sheer genius), a large piece of crispy chicken skin.  Yum.

The flavours, while intimidating at first, work so well together.  The chicken is soft and unbelievably flavourful, and the crispy chickpeas work perfectly with the garlic aioli.  The chicken skin was the true star, however, and although a bit greasy for a salad, was a totally welcome surprise.

It's a bit pricey - you'll pay $9+tax for a salad, but it's well worth it for an unusual and creative lunch."}
{"text":"Great spot. Food was awesome. Presentation was excellent. Service was great. Went there for brunch with my girlfriend. Server was very attentive. The owner even came by and chatted us up for bit. 

Try to get a spot on their really cool patio. Some interesting graffiti art on the walls. Will be back again real soon."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times. We literally stumbled upon it on a weekend, trying to find a new spot for brunch.

We had the jerk chicken frittata, coconut shrimp scramble, chicken and waffles, and the short rib hash. I like a good menu with a few odd combinations and this one didn't disappoint. Everything was good, creative and tasty. Service was good both times. They played a nice selection of old school hip hop, which I loved. Definitely a place to check out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Come and get it is straightforward. You pick salad, sandwich, or poutine. I've tried all the salads and sandwiches, and the salads are the best options. Don't think of it as healthy, though. They come drenched in dressing. The portions are plenty adequate for a lunch, and lines move quickly. The Granny Smith caesar is the one to focus on.

It's a decent lunch place that'll soon be a condo--actually. Once Come and Get It vanishes from the space it'll probably just take a few months to vanish from my memory too."}
{"text":"Cool space and cool venue, but the food didn't quite hit the spot in my books, but I only tried the salad. 

Come and Get It is a pop-up restaurants at the Northwest corner Queen and Spadina.  Decor is kinda pop-grunge warehouse with tables and stools made for plywood, but spraypainted bright colours with high-gloss finish.  

The menu is pretty neat.  You can basically pick: short rib, granny smith apples or green beans either as a sandwich, salad or poutine.  

While the poutine was tempting, we tried the Beef Short Rib salad and the Green Bean salad.  The beef short rib salad came with deliciously tender beef, nice crispy onions on a bed of spinach and arugula.  My 'beef' was that the balsamic vinaigrette was waay too tangy!!!  It was fine when pared with the beef, but I could barely finish my greens once I had downed the meat.  The Green Bean salad was fine, but completely unmarkable.  It had quinoa and a nice tomato vinaigrette.  It wasn't that filling nor especially tasty.  Too bad.

I may need to come back for the sandwiches or poutine instead!"}
{"text":"I can never get enough of grab and go food places with small menus, interesting flavour combinations and quality ingredients.

\"Come and get it\" definitely fits the build. With 5 main options but with a choice of 3 styles (sandwich, salad, or poutine). They keep the selection simple and the ingredients fresh. 

I had the spicy mango jerk chicken with mango slaw, jerk aioli, iceberg lettuce, and crispy banana chips. 

And while the jerk was a little too herby for my taste the crispy banana chips well made up for it. They added a crunch and flavour that really made the sandwich.

The bread was perfect. Portuguese style bun, with a soft centre but textured, slightly crunchy exterior, as a regular bread baker who grows my own sourdough yeast starter, I don't think I could have picked or baked a better bun. 

Pretty sure I'll come back for the Hawaiian pork belly soon. Hoisin glazed pork belly, pineapple salsa, crispy crackling, pickled red onion and iceberg lettuce...

Only wish they used another lettuce... And maybe a different name and decor... reminds me Fresh Prince of Bellair meets a Hawaiian beach hut, which sounds amazing but in reality a beach hut is only amazing at the beach..."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious!  
A simple menu that has so many options!!

While I have many favourites, I am absolutely addicted to C&GI's veggies sandwich.  It made me realize that every other veggies sandwich out there is same old boring grilled veggie option (slimy veggies forced to be sucked into one bite and leave the rest of the sandwich bare).  C&GI's veggie sandwich is so different and delicious.  It's what a veggie sandwich should be - fresh, crunchy, light and the hummus is unreal!!!  

Seriously addicted to this place!"}
{"text":"Didn't photograph food, it was gone too fast. Very special Valentine's Day brunch, amazing food and service! My husband is happy with his IPA too :)"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place since it was a \"popup\" shop. I used to love going to that place, see the gameboys and nintendos. Ordering a fantastic sandwich with fries.

And then I followed their twitter to see when they opening again. Finally got a chance to come here, and sorry, it's just not the same.

Where did the nintendo go? Why is there a brunch menu? I know it was capitalizing on \"snack bar\" phenomena, but I couldn't believe that they did away with the sandwiches at some hours of the day.

So brunch on a sunday, seems to make sense I guess. Fried chicken and waffles, it's a far cry from the first time I had this in ATL. First, I got chunks of fried chicken instead of what I thought I'd get which was like a drumstick, or a thigh. The chicken still had some cartilage on it, not the end of the world. The chicken tasted nice as did the toppings on top.

The waffle, I think it needs to be slightly sweeter. Maybe they expect the dousing in whip cream (which tasted great btw) and the syrup would make it sweeter.

The salad was huge, with greens and tons of grapes in it.

I'd still like to get a sandwich again though."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I read about it in the Grid and had to try it.
The mango jerk chicken sandwich is the best! The crispy skin fried to be like bacon was so good and the slices of mango was a nice contract in flavor to the jerk spices in the chicken.
And the fries, they are like string fries and for $3 is a steal! I had to pack some home there was so much.

Then I came back for the granny smith chicken caeser. I don't think it's as good the mango jerk chicken but it was nice and not too much mayo either. And they don't post it, but they have a soup and sandwich combo. Comes with a drink as well.

The waiter the second time was really nice, came around to see how we're doing and whether we're enjoying the food.

This is a 5 star place!"}
{"text":"CHECK IN THROUGH YELP APP - you get discounted POUTINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have been longing to come check this place out reading all the great reviews and the fear that it will close without any notice!

I love the atmosphere in this place - light, airy, and COLOURFUL :) I love colours. I felt like I was in elemenatry school again with the giant chalkboards listing menu options, high table tops, and lunchboxes containing archie comics... brought back so many memories as a kid!

I really could not decide what to get - healthy dinner, greasy spoon? Combination of both? sounds good to me :) Hearing about the great salad, I just had to try it. I'm stingy with dressing so I always get it on the side. Very surprised and pleased that it was not a creamy based, but rather a tomato vinegrette that had a nice flavour to it. The salad was large filled with  mixed greens, lettuce, tomatoes cucumbers, quinoa, and of course beans! All the ingredients were fresh and a very good portion. The Owner, I think he was the owner, said that it was so big that it could feed two people. I didn't want to contradict his thoughts,  but if he knew what type of salad eater I was, he would know that I could polish that off easily!

Along with my salad, I decided, based on the recommendation of Jay - the short rib poutine, in stead of the sandwich. It was topped with crispy onions which I enjoyed, but I wish there was more shortrib. I believe that there was more than one type of cheese, mixing up the flavours. The fries were a little bit too greasy for me, so I was a little bit disappointed.Maybe if there was more gravy, I would be all over it.

Definitely come and get it before it's GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cute patio in the back. The food is fine, less adventurous and creative than the menu suggests it will be. Nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Before anyone gets mad at me, we wanted to come here to try the Beef rib sandwich but it was sold out.

We actually stood looking at teh menu for quite a bit of time before someone came out.  We decided on the apple chicken sandwich.  We were excited about the N64 but it wasn't working (sigh) minus 1 star

Sandwich was not bad, I wouldn't say it was huge.  We weren't a fan of the oil and didn't realize they put alot of the garlic oil in there.  The chicken tasted like the ones from a shawarma but better.

Overall it was ok.  Compared to the value at Banh Mi boys I'd say the value was better there.  

I'll go back and try the beef rib poutine at some point.  

FYI the will be there until the end of summer and they are looking for a new locale"}
{"text":"Used the yelp poutine discount - pulled chicken poutine for $5. 
(and couldn't resist the fresh unsweetened iced tea for $1.50)

Very relaxed enviro, which I can appreciate.

I think I may have ordered the wrong thing, because this wasn't great. It was so salty, and I didn't get a big feel for the chicken."}
{"text":"Ummm...I liked this place. Liked, not loved. 

The service was great. Very friendly and informative. They even cut our sandwich three ways after it had already been delivered to the table (I'm sorry about that, bearded server) 

For me, the promise and intrigue of the menu (granny smith slaw on a Cesar salad! Crispy chicken skin?!) just didn't translate to the finished product. It took ages to even decide what to get because everything sounded so awesome. 

Expectations set too high? Perhaps. For example, the apple was not tart enough to stand out, and the chicken skin was greasy and just in one big piece on top (could have been good incorporated into the salad like bacon bits). We also ordered the pork rib sandwich. It was tasty but super duper greasy, and the side coleslaw was meager indeed (maybe I was just really looking forward to it. But I'm a weirdo and could eat good coleslaw for days) 

Solid 3 from moi! 

Cute interior though...super late 80's, early 90's aesthetic, all toying with our nostalgia which seems to be a popular thing these days."}
{"text":"The chicken was overdone pretty tough. The flavour was nice but they charged me 16 dollars for a wrap and a little cup of salad i felt pretty ripped off"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this place last night & did not have a good experience. The waiter seemed to be in a pissy mood and didn't like us asking for her recommendations. It is very OVERPRICED, I paid $8 for 4 tiny bite sized calamari tacos, and my friends paid $11 for a mixed drink.. absolutely insane. In addition, two of my friends ordered poutine and sent it back because the gravy was completely burnt. Luckily they didn't have to pay for it but I would never visit this place again. No wonder it was completely empty upon arrival."}
{"text":"Check in on Yelp and you get the regular poutine for just $5 (enough to feed 2 - 3 people or one extremely gluttonous man -- i.e. me).  I think there's some other kinda deal on FourSquare too.

So yup, this place is trendy as all hell.  But it's a pop-up shop - it's like hating on a crackhead for stealing stuff - it's in their nature.  The staff is really cool and don't have the usual snottiness you get at 'hip' food joints - the cashier was cool and I called them a couple of times as I misplaced one of my jackets and they were really helpful in helping me.

With that said, I thought the food was so-so.  Had the chipotle braised beef shortrib sandwich and... (shrug).  The poutine - while a monstrous portion - was pretty dry.

Will be back as the service is dope and it's a good place to grab a quick meal - but I don't understand the buzz.  Remove the kitschy interior and the 'limited time' appeal of this place, it's a solid but pretty plain-jane joint."}
{"text":"FINALLY! I FINALLY MADE IT TO \"COME AND GET IT!\"  I remember the first time I went, it was  Sunday - and it was closed.  I was a sad puppy.  The second time I tried to go, it was  Saturday, but of the long weekend - also closed. I was a sadder puppy.

But finally! I went yesterday and ate some delicious food.

Firstly, the décor here is AWESOME.  \"Retro?\" I guess you can say that.  I wouldn't really consider THAT retro yet.  However, I was in love. The music! Also all 90's. I felt like I was a teenager all over again and the best dance party ever.

The food! Fellow Yelper, Jason C., and I ordered two things: 
1) SPECIAL: DUCK CONFIT SANDWICH. Duck confit, with pear and I think pork skin. The duck was paired well with the pear. But it wasn't my favourite.
2) HAWAIIAN PORK BELLY FRIES: I'm a sucker for gravy. Especially the gravy that they had at Come and Get It.  The pork was delicious - glazed with hoisin sauce, I felt like I was eating the pork that I can get down street in Chinatown (which I don't mind!) Then you add on cheese curds and this crispy strips?

Yessssss, please."}
{"text":"The last time we were at CAGI, they were at their original pop-up location on Spadina where you could play video games while you waited for your food. It was clearly time to try out their new location. We ordered a couple coffees while we perused the menu and decided on the CAGI Fry up and the Breakfast poutine. The coffee was strong, fresh and bottomless. The Fry up was filling with sweet and smoky baked beans and maple sweet bacon. The poutine was ultra rich with hollandaise, a poached egg and bacon. We left stuffed and happy and determined to come back."}
{"text":"I'll join the chorus singing the praises of the chipotle short rib and Hawaiian glazed pork belly sandwiches. We ate ours w/ a side of poutine and were full for hours after. The chipotle in the beef is mild so I added squirts of hot sauce. The pork belly was fine  and didn't need any of the sauces. I'm glad I finally made it here and will try to return before they close at the end of October."}
{"text":"Well if you are in the Queen and Spadina \"hood\", you should definitely check out Come and Get it!

This pop-up restaurant will be for ??? long.
So check it out soon.

I had the beef short rib sandwich, poutine (normal) combo.
My friend had the pulled pork sandwich and salad combo.

Cool place -- very efficient and just a few items on the menu but the food is great!
They are very \"green\" so all the packages are recyclable.

They have some rough sitting but you can actually sit by the window and the windows open (so great for those nice days)!

Note!  The combos do not include the specialty poutines or salad.
The food was fresh and hot.

Wonderful flavours!
We'll be eating here as long as we can."}
{"text":"The brunch is great, but the poutine is really not great. Haven't tried other dinner menu items (and won't be after that poutine..*shudder*) BUT the brunch is really really good."}
{"text":"Went by for a quick bite the other day, service was fast. Had the chipotle beef shortrib sandwich, could taste the difference between the chipotle and the ancho, nice flavours, crispy onions, good slaw. Served on a big warm ciabatta style kaiser bun, soaked up all the sauces nicely. My friend had the hawaiian pork belly, which I took a bite of, I'm not a fan of pineapple on sandwiches, but the pork belly was perfect, nice sweet sauce, almost like a plum sauce. The only downside was that the crackling served on top of it was hard as a rock and inedible. 

Good value, $7 is worth it for a big sandwiches like these.

Well done for a pop up, gotta love a place that plays Chubb Rock and has an n64 hooked up, will be back for more, gonna try a poutine next time."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times for a snack.  This is a very simple set-up restaurant with wooden ply-wood communal tables, napkins and and utensils stored in kiddie lunch boxes at each table.  The menu is on a large chalkboard on the wall featuring only sandwiches ($8), salads ($9), or poutines ($7), with your choice of beef short ribs, chicken caesar, pork belly, or crunchy green beans.  They usually have a feature as well.  

Hawaiian Pork Belly Poutine: $7 (3/4 stars)
The portion cannot get any bigger!! It was served in a giant take out box and a load of fries, a sweet(ish) gravy, pork belly, and pork rinds.  I enjoyed the pork belly and the crunch of the pork rinds a lot, and the fries were fried to perfection as well.  However, I was not a huge fan of the gravy.  I usually love to dunk anything in gravy, but the sweetness prevented that.

Chipotle Beef Ribs Sandwich: $8 (4/5 stars)
Very tasty, but not sure I got the smokey chipotle flavour though.  Overall, a very yummy sandwich served with a slaw.

Service: (5/5 stars)
Both times here, the same guy behind the counter was so friendly and helpful!

When I asked the guy behind the counter what the whole condo thing is about, he told me they are only around till July when Condos will take over.  They're only trying out the concept in the neighborhood.  So come and get it while you can!"}
{"text":"Ugh. My dinner was delicious. Had the slider with coconut shrimp, poutine with jerk chicken, and the flatbread with the chicken caesar (best part of my meal). The food was creative, fun and flavourful - and reasonably priced. The service was amazing - our waiter was super friendly, and everyone was attentive to our party. I really loved it. Excited to see your brunch/dessert menu guys!"}
{"text":"The good: the food. The food was pretty good. Not award quality but good.

The bad: the coffee. Coffee was not terribly good which for a brunch is kind of a let down.

The ugly: THE WAIT! Come on people, waiting 75 minutes for 3 brunch plates is not acceptable. Also I would have expected some apology for it.

Prices were kind of okay but on the high side of okay. Will probably not be back."}
{"text":"This loudly-decorated place is awesome! We sat on the back patio and it was a little oasis in the middle of the Queen West neighborhood. The walls were filled with graffiti and balanced out with beautiful wooden tables and greenery. 

We LOVED the menu concept - pick your flavor profile and then select how you want to eat it - slider, poutine, wrap, etc. Not to mention, it was nicely priced with decent portions. 

Since we were hopping along Queen West for various cocktails and snacks, we chose the pork rinds and mini poutine with chorizo, crema, pico de gallo, etc. The fries were super great, but the toppings were a little cold. They also had profiles that included chipotle bbq, cornmeal crusted chicken Caesar and jerk chicken. 

Our server was fantastic in helping us choose what to eat and drink. I enjoyed a Paper Plane, which I learned is a popular bourbon cocktail in Canada. It was the perfect blend of sweet, sour and strong. 

We highly recommend Come and Get It for a snack and cocktail...we just also wish they were playing the similarly titled Selena Gomez song to round out the experience. ;)"}
{"text":"It's been written up, praised, and beckoning me with it's graffiti-like sign for months, and while I'm often in the area, I always pass by it, opting for the tried and true comforting chinatown fare, but yesterday my friend spotted the \"closing october 25th\" and that was what ultimately brought me in. and made me realize WHAT I WAS MISSING OUT ON ALL THESE MONTHS!

we ordered a chipotle shortrib and two sodas. it came all meaty and drippy, dripped all the way down my mouth and left thick oil streaks on the container, which should have been alarming, but instead I licked that shit up like a starved dog given a bone.

the portion is a bit small compared to other 'wich shops, but it was perfect for me and my companion; we shared one, which left us just around 80% full and i stopped myself from ordering another one as i'm trying to cut down on the gluttony, but I'm definitely going to back for you, hawaiian pork belly!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they were open on spadina. I have always had the pork belly sandwich or poutine and I have never been disappointed. 

The portion is generous, and he pork belly is always juicy. The crackling can even be said to be tastier than the fries. 

Make sure you have someone to share the poutine with you. They sandwiches are awesome. And remember to get their iced tea, nice and fresh."}
{"text":"3.5 for this place. Came here after a 10K run so I was fairly hungry with my group. We didn't have to wait coming it right a prime brunch hour right around 11am and were seated in the back patio. The service missed the mark for me with the server forgetting to bring us utensils, dropping forks on us and not really checking up us during our meal. I ordered the chicken and waffles. I found the waffles fairly basic but the chicken was crispy and tasty. You also get a choice of side (I opted for bacon and eggs, which were nothing special). 

Overall, I had a decent experience, would recommend dropping in you're looking for a new brunch eat but probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"friendly staff, a place where 'everybody knows your name', Amazing tacos, and a ready-to-be creative bartender.  for small groups wanting to listen to some good music and enjoy the evening, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Nice place for a quick bite if you're in the neighbourhood and not feeling like the usual Chinatown food. This is a pop up and they are gonna keep in operation until told to leave for condo developments. So I wanted to try this place before it disappears! 

The space (previously Ackee Tree) is industrial and simple, with a long picnic table at the back and some seating up front. Each table has your condiments and napkins packed into 80's cartoon lunchboxes with some old Archie comics in a bucket, plus copies of NOW and The Grid. 

I had the chicken caesar sandwich combo. The sandwich was delicious! Flavourful but not too messy/saucy and the bread tasted very fresh. The chicken was crisp on the outside, but it wasn't like a breaded fillet, but rather pieces of chicken (like pulled pork but pulled... chicken). The sandwich alone was quite filling, and I couldn't finish the fries. The fires were kinda disappointing. Too skinny, IMO -- just oil but not enough potato. I had their iced tea, which is unsweetened but they bring it to you with their watermelon sweetener which is basically simple syrup with some watermelon flavour. Yummy and refreshing! 

I want to come back and try one of the poutines, since if you check-in you unlock a coupon for $5 full-size poutine!"}
{"text":"Step One:
Do you want an 8 dollar sandwich?  A 9 dollar salad?  A 7 dollar poutine?

That's the first problem.  The prices are far too high.  The sandwiches are not big enough to be filling, but at 8 dollars they really should be.  The 9 dollar salad would be great if someone else way buying, but...  The poutine is really the best option.  But then with so many other poutine offerings in the city, why are you here?

There are five flavours you can put on it.  I tried Apple and Chicken (which was dry) and Hawaiian Pork Belly (which was fantastic!)

I give this place two stars, because the interior is not to my liking (my Ray Ban Wayfarers aren't polished enough) - and no amount of 1980s pop culture lunch boxes makes up for the prices.

But, would I return for a Hawaiian Pork Belly poutine?  

Yes...  I probably would.  

I had both offerings as sandwiches, and while I'd never get the chicken again (even though the apple was a nice touch) the pork belly?  That was a real treat.  

And, you know, if someone else was buying - I might return for two sandwiches.  But, on my budget?  If I'm dropping ten bucks, I better be walking away full.  Especially in China Town."}
{"text":"This review is aptly called, \"The Night of Bullshit\". Slow service, terrible food, generally depressing. We had been here before and had a great experience, but something changed. The result? Disaster. 

We ordered the \"try it all\" tasting menu of bar snacks. Mistake! It was A 2 hr ordeal. We felt like we were trapped in a POW camp, waiting for the next morsel of sub-par food, yet hoping we'd just die. But then we'd be served a taunting morsel to be reminded that we were still alive as the server and kitchen strove to fulfill take out orders or to pour beers for the cook.

This was a Friday night and the busiest point was a body count of 8 people in the whole restaurant. No excuse really for the bad food and service. We ordered shots of bourbon to keep us entertained. Guess what? They short poured us each time. Quit playing us for chumps. So insulting. Overall the worst dining and drinking experience in the city I have had in a while. NEXT!"}
{"text":"Found this place as I was strolling down Spadina. The simple menu attracted me, and I ordered the Chipotle Beef Short Rib sandwich with poutine meal, which included a drink. It was about $15. Kind of pricey and was underwhelmed. Felt like this place was taking advantage of the hipster/foodie trend."}
{"text":"Was a really big fan of this place before they moved.  (5 star for sure), but was slightly disappointed with the new location.

Locale: They have a full bar and an more upscale look from their original location. The location is very small (2 tables for 6 ppl each, a bar for 8 ppl, and 1 more small table for 2).   I would suggest getting take out.

Service:  6 of us came, and it took them a while to get us settles in, they first placed us at the bar (without providing food menus) and then moved us to the table as soon as it opened up.  Once we got seated, the single waitress was busy, so it took some time to get the actual order and finally get the food.  Overall it took over an hour for the lunch.  

Food:  I got the special (Calamari sandwich with a side of a Salad).  The salad was not seasoned well, and was bitter, but the sandwich was good. 
With tax and tip, the meal was $15.  

Next time I will order chicken Caesar salad which I expect will be better."}
{"text":"Tonight I went to go grab a quick bite at Banh Mi Boyz, but the place had a huge line and I was in a rush. So we continued along Spadina and quickly passed Come and Get It. I've known about the place forever, but for some reason I never went to it. So tonight was the perfectly opportunity.

At Come and Get It, you can get everything in either sandwich, salad, or poutine form. They have beef short ribs, hawaiian pork belly with pineapple salsa, caesar chicken with green apple slaw, jerk chicken with mango slaw, and herbed green crunchy beans with something... to be honest, the green crunchy beans weren't even an option in my mind. (I am terrible) We opted to get the beef short ribs and the jerk chicken in sandwich form. The beef short rib sandwich was nice and juicy. It was a good replacement for Banh Mi Boyz beef cheek steamed bao. Think saucy beef cheek sandwich... or sloppy jose. It was yummy. The jerk chicken was nice and spicy, and also had a mango slaw. If you enjoy spicy, and can handle spicy, you might want to consider it. I wouldn't have wanted it any spicier, and it was possibly too spicy for my girlfriend FYI...

The decor is kind of interesting. The utensils are inside New Kids On the Block lunch boxes which is kind of funny. And overall the place has a picnic table kind of feel. Very laid back. And the most beautiful thing about it, was that there was NO line, and places for us to sit, while being delicious at the same time. I would totally recommend Come and Get It. Go get it now!"}
{"text":"My experience was more positive than most of the reviews below and I have no problem letting it rip on useless food or arrogant and self-satisfied waiters so here goes:
1- Food taste: it was fine, but we ordered poutine and I was disappointed that their poutine lacked gravy and the cheese curds were not melting as a result. It was not bad. It is their style and their recipe that is at fault. On its own though the poutine was fine.
2- Food quantity: lots.. we could not finish our food.. They do not cheap out. You pay for it of course, but you do not leave hungry.
3- Service: Superb. The girl waitressing for lunch was kind, caring, sweet and always enthusiastically checking up on us. She may be the owner. If she is not she should become!
4- Setting: the summer doors were open and one could sit at high tables, low tables or in the funky backyard patio. The backyard patio was fun and full of ugly graffiti  (like all graffiti of course) or murals. There you can sit in the shade or under the sun. By the way, sitting in the back is fine as the waitress will give you attentive service regardless.
5- As mentioned had poutine, which like burgers and everything else there is matched with flavours like Pulled Pork, Korean Bulgogi, Bacon, Club, Chipotle and so forth. Neat idea!"}
{"text":"Nah. Didn't feel it all that much.  But really not that bad. Just find that it's competitors right near by blow it away. Also eat here while you can. I believe this plot of land is turning into a condo"}
{"text":"Okay, I vow to get through this review without a Selena Gomez reference but no promises. 
First off, I'm a poutine addict. There was actually a whole month where I was determined to try all the places from Smokes to Poutinis which made the best of lists in various blogs. There was no mention of Come and Get It on foodie blog posts. I had no idea this place even existed and had in fact passed by this location countless times before...I blame the weird spray painted sign which gave it a sketchy vibe. 
Well that was my loss as this place serves up the best poutine I've ever had. The fries are crisp and the ingredients all taste fresh. I ordered the mango jerk chicken poutine and it ranks among the strangest things I've ever eaten but it's also surprisingly amazing. My dining companion also thoroughly enjoyed their vegetarian poutine, who knew? The portions are huge and they don't skimp on anything either. 
The service was great and once you're inside the restaurant you'll understand the whole 80s vibe they have going on. I thoroughly felt the need to have a Fresh Prince marathon after eating and you probably will too after a meal here. 
My new favourite discovery this month!!!"}
{"text":"Come and get it! I was so excited when I heard you'd re-opened in a permanent location. The pop up on queen and Spadina was potentially my favourite lunch spot in the city. Went the new spot for a bite and a cocktail on Saturday night, and was very open to the new menu ideas. The fact that I could have the delicious pork belly of old in so many different variations was exciting enough. The staff were great, really friendly and helpful and explained the menu and ordering options very well. The atmosphere was pretty good. The deco... where the same idea worked so well in the old queen spot, felt slightly forced in this new space. Not horrible, but not particularly cool or interesting... so far so good. We ordered a plethora of treats from the menu. A couple of flat breads, a bag bites , and a couple of snacks and a poutine. As I said before, the old place was one of my favourite Toronto spots, so I came in with high expectations of perfectly cooked meat and well put together, simplistic but delicious dishes. In truth, I was disappointed. The meat was not brilliantly cooked as it used to be. There were changes that had been made I wasn't mad on. Pulled chicken seems to have changed to deep fried. The brisket was over powered by BBQ/tomato sauce. The meat in General was a bit dry, where as it was always so juicy before. I will say nothing was horrible by any means, just not mouth watering as it used to be. If you want my opinion, which you may well not... I think the way to make come and get it a feature in Toronto dining as it was, is go back to basics. A cocktail or two and delicious sandwich. If you want people queuing at your door each night I think you need to make it more through trafficy than bar-y (it's an obvious comparison but think Grand Electric)
I'd go again sometime, although I'd be back every weekend if it flipped back to same quality it was in the old location!
As I said before, staff are a huge attribute here."}
{"text":"Have been waiting for their permanent space to open since the pop-up closed, went as soon as it opened. Very nice, casual relaxed space with delicious food. Still has some of the best salads in T.O. or go for dinner and get to try a bunch of snack sizes of their lunch mains. My favourite is the jerk chicken like the combination of the heat and the sweet."}
{"text":"Reopened at 676 queen street! And the food is still great, with lunch pretty much the same. The jerk chicken salad was so good,"}
{"text":"Reserving the fifth star until a few more visits because this place is kind of too good to be true. The Granny Apple Chicken Caesar salad is AWESOME. Crispy chickpeas and crispy fried chicken skin are the best crouton substitutes ever. The chicken (I got a lot of dark meat, yay!) was so juicy and yummy and peppered perfectly. At first I thought the salad could use a little more dressing, but with some more mixing (looking desperately for chick peas) I found it to be perfect. The apples felt like an afterthought though, I like how they were cut but there wasn't a whole lot of flavour coming from them. Flakes of parmesan were nicely distributed.

Yum, seriously try the Granny Apple Chicken Caesar!! I got it to go and everything was still crispy 40 minutes later.

Tried the short rib poutine, it was delicious but something in it upset my stomach. I have a feeling it was sodium packed but didn't taste like it. The flavours were all yummy and every little thing made sense like the fried onions. While I prefer thick cut fries for poutine, the thin fries were very yummy and stayed crispy in some spots even though I travelled with it."}
{"text":"We were greeted once we walked up to the menu board, and I think he's the owner of the place. He was friendly and quick to ask whether we've been to Come and Get It, and walked us through their menu.

We ordered their beef short rib sandwich which was tender and tasty, though make sure you have some napkins handy! We also had their jerk chicken sandwich which I think was good and had a nice spice, though my boyfriend preferred another place. Both the sandwiches were served on a nice crusty bun with a side of apple slaw with a nice kick of acid.

We checked in on Yelp, so we upgraded our side of poutine to a regular size for just $5. I quite like the skinny fries, though I only wished the gravy were warmer so it melted the cheese curds a little bit better. But overall the poutine had the taste and not overly salted!"}
{"text":"My friend and I randomly searched for brunch places in the area and this popped up so we visited this restaurant. I got the pulled pork hash and my friend got the cheesy tots. I expected to get more from what I have to pay (which was I think around $16) but I did enjoy it. The cheese tots were made wonderfully, the cheese was the right texture, it was also my first time trying cheese tots. Maybe if I'm in the area then I'll swing by this area again! Also, the waitress there, her name is Jynee I believe, is beyond amazing. Her customer service was top notch and was extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"Menu was well-priced and very creative; a no-frills approach to gourmet poutine with what are very clearly the freshest of ingredients.  Gravy was as good as I've had!  The pork crackling was so good I only wish I'd had a few beers before eating to ...enhance the experience.

Decor is cool and retro, with a plethora of old lunch boxes and Archie comics keeping the condiments company on each table; the N64 by the cash is a genius touch and kept me around longer than expected.

The staff was friendly, attentive and helpful in recommending choices.  I will be back, soon, and wholeheartedly recommend Come And Get It to anyone looking for a slick and tasty experience!  Consider putting off lunch until you've officially finished being productive for the day as I felt like a big nap afterward.

Oh, and recyclable forks made from potato?  What?"}
{"text":"If you are reading this, listen to the next few words very carefully for they will be the culmination of this review, YOU MUST COME!

Though I've passed by Spadina and Queen St. a dozen times, I've never noticed this place despite the right in your face store name. 

The interior is so neat filled with vintage things (you can play N64 while you wait for food). The menu seemed confusing at first but basically there are five things you can get in three different formats, sandwich, salad or poutine. 

We tried their beef short rib sandwich, pork belly salad and jerk chicken poutine. Each one was absolutely delicious and a large portion. Between those three things it fed two of my friends and I.

The store employee was super friendly and came over to help us decide when we were staring at the menu for a long time. He made sure everything was okay for us despite having to serve other customers. 

Everything except the cans were biodegradable so that was super cool. 

You have to come before they close as I don't know how long they will be around for since they're just a pop up store."}
{"text":"I don't casually use words like \"palsy-walsy,\" so trust me when I say that the service is beyond friendly at Come And Get It. I was in here barely a femtosecond before a bearded gentleman took me by the hand (not literally) and welcomed me to a world of wonders. Delicious wonders.

CAGI is a sandwich shop at the corner of Queen and Spadina. It's a pop-up shop, which means it's only around until a condominium will take its place. Typical, amiright? The result for this resto is a real DIY aesthetic and live-for-today attitude. It's pretty sparse in here with plywood finishes, some picnic tables for seating and a few Archie comics strewn about for good measure. Fun.

Everything on the menu comes as either a salad, a sandwich or a poutine. Though the duck confit special was tempting, I got a beef rib sandwich instead. It was served with crispy onions and refreshing coleslaw on a milk bun. Tasty. At $9 for a sandwich, I'm not going to become a regular but they do have a pretty tempting Yelp check-in offer if you're into poutine.[1] 

Obligatory Title Pun: You better hurry 'cause it's going fast...[2]

Menu Readability: Big ol' chalkboard and graffiti styled signage. Respect.

Need to mention: Everything in the restaurant is recyclable or biodegradable. Their forks are made of potatoes!

What this place teaches me about myself: Am I the only one that hates Archie comics? Just take them both, Archibald!

{"text":"I've walked past Come and Get It numerous times and it's so inconspicuous and ghetto-looking on the outside. There's a chalkboard outside claiming that this establishment has 4 stars on Yelp and 96% on that other review site.

Today I decided to give this place a try and I'm glad I did. There are 5 ingredients and 3 styles to choose from:

Ingredients:
- Beef short rib
- Pork belly
- Chicken caesar
- Green beans
- Jerk chicken

Styles:
- Sandwich
- Salad
- Poutine

You can also order a combo, which includes a side and a drink. I couldn't determine what the drink options were so I decided to go with a regular meal. I ordered the beef short rib sandwich. I generally don't like the cow-y taste of beef, but the beef short rib was amazingly delicious. I could not tell that I was eating beef, it was nice and smooth. The bun that it comes on is nice and crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside.

The interior of the place is definitely hipster/retro. There are a lot of 80's and 90's memorabilia around. There are several wooden picnic tables if you plan on staying."}
{"text":"unique hipster joint....

fun friendly staff..  food tasted good but portions are quite small.

pricey but you should expect it when eating at a place like this... unique menu that changes."}
{"text":"This place specializes in poutine and being kind to the earth. Two of my favorite things colliding in an ultra cool (like too-cool-for-everyone-super-hipster-on-steroids) environment. 

The poutines all seem to be good, and their fancy pouts, like the short rib i had, actually work. They aren't just an order-once-novelty-type poutine. 

I've been twice, and as mentioned I had the short rib poutine, and the second time I just had the regular poutine.

It's delicious, BUT it's a bit dry. They need to be more generous with the gravy. 

For just a poutine, it's also a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I was blessed to have my date order everything on the menu.

First of all, OMG THANK YOU.

Now the food!!

We had each flavour on a slider. Everything was amazing. I think the most boring flavour is the Fried Chicken Caesar, that is my least favourite. But if I were to rate them all on a scale, everything would be 10. And the Fried Chicken would be 8.

The food portions are tiny. Yes. That is unfortunate!! The poutine is like the size of a piece of toast. Even for a short Asian girl that is me.... oh wait but I eat a lot.

So I don't visit as often as I'd like. Let me just end this review on the Hawaiian Pork Belly, which was so fatty and slimy and pork-i-ful. Mouthgasm happens here."}
{"text":"Just had the beef rib sandwich, fries and homemade iced tea. You can tell effort and quality were put forth in this meal - the meat was super tender and not too saucy. Service was extremely friendly as well, definite recco!"}
