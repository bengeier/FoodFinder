{"text":"Great place for a beer and dinner.  In town from Chicago and was looking for good food and a chance to watch football..  I had the Sunday special, and a few local brews..   if you are in the area, stop by.."}
{"text":"Great English style pub. Staff are friendly and they have happy hour drink specials on weekdays."}
{"text":"The food was great, the beer cold, the place stunning, but, if the service is not good, it just kinda ruins things, we had an appointment at 1pm, we were seated and no one acknowledged us, even though there were at least 2 servers that I could see walking by, other tables got seated and served , it wasn't until 25  mins. that a server finally answer when I tried to get her attention, she apologized for the confusion, but, then we had to wait 10 mins. for our drinks and 30 mins. for the food.  So if you have a lot of time and a lot of patience and don't mind waving your hands like a maniac to get the servers attention, then, this is your place."}
{"text":"Great vibe, but the waitress is not having any of it. Drinks are a tad more expensive but they have a few craft beer which works for me!  Very cozy and a go-to place no matter day is it. Just don't expect the best service as it is a \"seat-yourself\" type of bar and our waitress hasn't checked on us since she dropped off our drinks. The atmosphere is great though."}
{"text":"This place has great decor and the food is decent but as mentioned by  some of the other reviews, they are simply not ready to handle large parties. I would give this place a negative star if I could and I'll explain why.  Reason #1 : For my birthday celebration, I had made a reservation for a table of 20 people a month in advance. When we arrived for our celebration, we were informed AT THE TIME, that there was no Prosecco or Champagne even though they have Mimosas on their menu ?!?!!? Our server simply told us that there was a problem with their shipment and therefore their order hadn't arrived. At first, I really thought my friends were just joking with me - except it wasn't a joke. It is completely understandable that issues like these can arise for any restaurant but what sets  a restaurant apart is how well they resolve the issue. In my regard, this restaurant failed miserably.  The server offered us no solutions whatsoever ! My friends even offered to run over to the nearest liquour store to purchase some Prosecco but the restaurant wouldn't allow us to serve it. I don't mean to sound like a brat but I just feel that the restaurant could have handled this differently in many ways. I don't even run a restaurant but I can think of a few ways : One, they could have at least called us in advance to give us the heads up (since this was a known situation) so that we could have gone elsewhere. Alternatively, if the shipment hadn't arrived, they could have stocked up from the LCBO!!! Lastly, they could have allowed us to bring our own bubbly. Worst of it all, despite all of this, there was no compensation or discount offered at the end of all this - WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.  Reason #2 : By 11:30 a.m. they ran out of scones. What restaurants serving brunch (and one which only opened at 11:00 a.m.!!!) runs out of scones within half an hour of opening.  They knew well in advance that they had a large party coming in but clearly the kitchen didn't plan for it.  Reason #3 : They assigned one server to a group of 20 ppl and I believe the poor girl was also serving other tables at the same time. Our food all arrived at different times (which we were warned of) but we practically had to chase our server down for a coffee refill and milk/cream refill.   All in all, aside from the great ambiance, the entire experience was a disappointment.  I called the restaurant the next day to express my disappointment. The assistant manager took my information down  and told me that the manager will be in touch offer me something to make it up to us but no one ever called.  This place has great promise but need new management - one that actually has experience in running a restaurant and didn't flunk Customer Service 101 in school."}
{"text":"This place make awesome pancakes and a great English breakfast! The portions are fairly large (especially the full English breakfast). The price is a little high for a breakfast, but the food does not disappoint  The decor is pretty sweet! Love all the lighting fixtures.   Their super relaxed, seat yourself style is great. In the summers they have a nice little outdoor patio.   Most of the times service is quick, but occasionally you'll have to wait 30mins+ for your food to come out. Just depends on how busy they are, which is to be expected as with any other place.    *UPDATE*  Finally came here for dinner. Got their banger and mash. The mashed potatoes are a bit on the liquify side especially that it's covered in beans, but even if you don't like more liquidy mash, it's still amazing.  You get two sausages, which make it more than filling. We also got scotch eggs, served with a vinegary sauce and pickles, so good! Pims cup, can't complain!   They do not carry tomato juice if you're looking for bloody Mary's... only Caesar's!"}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated and cozy (candles!), and very friendly service.  Didn't try the food, but a reasonable selection of beers and cocktails."}
{"text":"We went on the weekend and had a nice brunch.  We started with the Scones, Devonshire cream, and strawberry jam.  The Mushrooms on Toast had great flavor and an unexpected but enjoyable texture with tiny creminis on top.  My companion had the Buttermilk Pancakes with caramelized apples, creme fraiche, and maple syrup which she actually thought was too sweet.  The service was disinterested and not because they were busy.  It's a very nice, new place.  Just needs to break in a bit and lose some of the shine to be a proper pub."}
{"text":"this place is great!! awesome service bartender is amazing!! can't wait to come again wednesday night is a fun time!!!"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in the neighbourhood! Typical pub fare menu, and great selection of beers and cocktails."}
{"text":"Loved the old British decor of this pub, it definitely helps to elevate the pub experience. I dined here last night with a group of friends and watched the hockey game. Tall cans of beer were on special for $5 during the game which was a great deal!   My boyfriend and I started with the crab cake, which was phenomenal. Perfectly fried with a generous amount of crab and an amazing remoulade; I wanted to order another... The beef short rib and burger, which I was lucky enough to get a taste of from friends around the table, were very good. Perfectly cooked burger and fall off the bone short ribs. My fish and chips were fried nicely, but had no seasoning whatsoever. I ended up adding salt, which is something that I should not have to do at a restaurant, especially when I order something fried.  Overall, the food and drinks were great and the service was attentive and friendly. I will definitely return to have another crab cake."}
{"text":"This place recently opened up near my office.  Came here with some coworkers to check out the place for lunch, and again for after work drinks.  Envrionment: The interior is quite unique. To the right of the main entrance the room is decorated like a study and in the main area a large open space with a mix of communal and intimate tables.  Everything is decorated in wood which gives the room a more traditional pub feel.  The outside is a large patio facing Richmond St, great for people watching.  The patio is also covered by shade so you can enjoy the hot weather with none of the glaring sunlight in your eyes if that's your thing.  Food: They have a lunch special menu for the weekdays where you pick a sandwich and your choice of side salad.  I ordered a Reubon Sandwich with a Fennel salad which tasted amazing.  I've also had their Fish and Chips, pretty standard fish but some bomb fries.  FYI when ordering, the food and drink menus are separate and look fairly similar which is a bit confusing, you'll see what I mean when you come.  Service: The staff was friendly and attentative, which was surprising cause it's a new establishment. In a lot of new places restaurants are still trying to figure out their groove but this place was on point."}
{"text":"This new bar is absolutely beautiful with attention to details. I gave only three stars because the food wasn't good, I had fish and chips which wasn't fresh and it had wedges instead of fries.  BTW, I have heard this place closed as of June 25th. Make sure it's still open before heading out to here."}
{"text":"All style, no substance.  Went to this 'British Pub' for brunch on Saturday, and was pleasantly surprised by lovely decor, however the place was empty in the middle of what should normally be quite a busy period (telling).  The food was 'meh', and not compelling at all.  I don't know how you invest in such a beautiful space but ignore the food entirely, and I see no reason to return.  We asked for a mimosa, and the server came back saying they 'sold out'.  How do you 'sell out' when the place is empty?  We then asked if they had any cask ales (it's a British pub right?) and the server hadn't even heard of it before.  After we explained, he said that they 'sometimes have that but not right now'.  Suuure.  It's a shame to see such a lovely place miss such important details as food, keeping proper stock of high margin items, and how is it a British pub without cask ales?!  Disappointing visit.  Bill was astronomical for something I could whip up at home.  Servers were attentive and kind."}
{"text":"Food / drink: 4/10 Service: 6/10 Experience: 2/10  Prices are fair. The pub's really loud, music super loud, and definitely a bad choice for a nice intimate dinner. I had to constantly shout so the waitress can hear what I have to say. Service is slow, had to raise my hand every time we needed anything at the table.  We were seated in a booth which was facing the bar (really close to the bar), and when the bar area got really crowded, drunk folks were standing really close to our table, and they were even leaning at our table (almost sitting on our dining table). Wow.  I honestly was very disappointed at the whole experience, I wish it had more of a cozy intimate experience, but I guess I should not expect that from a downtown pub on a Friday night.  Food is just alright.  We only went there because of the location, good reviews on Yelp / Google, but definitely not coming back ever."}
{"text":"A nicer pub for when you want to go to a pub. Tucked underneath a condo/office building it can be easily missed with the dark exterior and nothing really jumps at you from the outside. But they have a lovely patio (although not much to look at and its underneath a lot of shade from the building)   Came here twice, once on a Saturday night past midnight and it was dead, maybe 1 or 2 other tables so don't come here looking for a party. The next on a Friday night, after work crowd and it was busy!  Good cocktail selection, I got the gin highball, pretty in pink colour great if you like a sweet drink. The food was ok, standard nothing stand-out, your regular pub food. I had the fries, decent good fries no complaints. The wings were standard but had a good crisp on the outside. The nachos were a big serving, their chips were slightly flavored like doritos which was good. There was also a big pile of iceberg lettuce on top, but it could have used a few more toppings. Tbh, I had better nachos at a chain resturant...  Service was friendly and prompt both times. And as noted by other the interiors are very nice! If you want a step up from your regular pub this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I usually come here for their dessert, the banoffee. However, they changed their recipe to cut some corners (while still charging the same expensive price) and it was absolutely terrible! Pre made plain crust and banana \"flavoured\" cream. Felt like store bought would've been better."}
{"text":"Found this place when I was looking up Brunch spots for our last day visiting Toronto. It was excellent! Actually, *is because I'm still here and writing this while my boyfriend watches the lions game.   From the outside I thought I had the wrong place because it looks like a swanky hotel, but inside is amazing and surprisingly different - very Gastro-pub looking with a great mix of modern and historic decor.   The staff are super friendly - they even offered immediately to change one of the TVs (they have tons showing plenty of games) to the specific game my boyfriend was looking for.   The food was awesome - I had the full English breakfast which was very true to Home (I grew up in London) and a generous portion of everything. My only, tiny complaint was that they don't do any menu substitutions which included when I asked if the eggs could be scrambled - they only made them sunny side up. Not a huge deal.  My boyfriend got the eggs Benedict which he told me were the best he had ever had - I've literally never heard him say that about anything, and he normally makes fun of me for saying that about everything. So I guess they were great.  If we lived in Toronto I'm sure this would become our 'local' because with the modern pub vibe, great food and drinks, friendly service plus all the sports TVs it's really perfect and reminds me a lot of London."}
{"text":"Super cozy pub that serves British fare.  Came here for brunch before a movie at Scotiabank Theatre.  Got the eggs benedict -- super delicious!  The staff is pretty friendly and decor inside is very nice.   The coffee could use some work (it tasted a bit burnt).  Brunch is a bit on the pricier side but overall, pretty yummy. :)"}
{"text":"This downtown spot is a great addition to this area of the city.  It's a relaxed but polish British style pub. Have to say that the library area is killer beautiful. It's used for events. Sweet spot just to pop in and take a look at it.  Came for brunch. Solid full English breakfast. Definitely filling and good flavour. My brunch partner in crime ordered the eggs benny with mushrooms. Both of us were pleased with our plates.  Customer service was on point. Pleasant, professional and good sense of humour.   Definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"Great food, but frustrated with the service/logistics. At the entrance, there is a sign that says \"please wait to be seated\" beside a sign that says \"please seat yourself\" - so which one is it? My friend made a reservation but there was no one there. I tried walking around to find someone but everyone was busy. They also charge $2 for mayo. But those factors aside...  The Butler's Steak was very good. Medium rare, very tender, non-fibrous with a distinct \"meat\" flavour. Pairs nicely with the gravy and fried onions. The fries are great as well. I also really liked the special $5 house white wine that night."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time Friday night and were very impressed! The food was spectacular; we split the Scotch Egg, Tartare, Chicken Mousse and the Mushroom Toast...all were extremely delicious!! We loved the ambiance too, though it was very loud (our only criticism) and it was tough to hear our server, though she was still quite good. Would definitely recommend and we'll be back there again soon!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is on the bottom floor of a fancy looking condo, so it is easy to walk by without noticing it if it wasn't for the patio furniture out front. Once inside, the space is well decorated and spacious. It reminds me of an upscale British pub that one may find in central London, with an eclectic mix of old-world paintings and flashy TV screens.   We came for a late dinner on a weekday and was promptly greeted at the front door. There was a game on, so the bar side was rowdy with cheering but the host was sensitive enough to ask if we wanted a quieter area (yes we did). The right side of the restaurant, by the wall-to-wall glass case of books was a much nicer and quieter space to have dinner.   I had the chicken pot pie with a fennel salad. Both were delicious, with the chicken pot pie catching the attention of the neighboring tables because the puff pastry was so tall. The filling for the pie was a little on the soupier side, so ask for a spoon before the waitress wanders off. A great place for a late meal, especially since they are open till 2am!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently. Definitely has aspects of the British pub going on but is kind of a cross with a sports bar. Lots of Big screen TVs playing a variety of sports including Soccer.  I had the Tagliatelle Bolognese.  Was most yummy with a very chunky meat sauce.   My friend had the Smoked Salmon Salad with the lentils.  They said it was also very good.  Lots of options on the menu including some standard pub meals, fish and chips, bangers and mash and curries.    The plates going by looked good as well. They serve bottle filtered water. Service was friendly but a little laid back.   Was not overly busy -- but will certainly go back and check out another option."}
{"text":"Went for a drink and catch the leafs game. Was quite packed so we sat at the bar and got our food and drinks. Good atmosphere to catch the game. Enjoying yes everything other than our bartenders service - maybe she was having a bad day. Will def be back for more sporting events"}
{"text":"I found this place in a write-up on CTV of where Prince Harry might go for brunch while he's in T.O. and mayyyybe this may have had a lot to do with choosing it for our own brunch. Yep, we're those people. Well, actually it was 2/6 of us. However, has he actually come here or are they just assuming he will come here because, well, English pub and royal namesake? In that case I'm sure Meghan Markle has other haunts that he can't get at home; thus I am feeling fooled.   Annnyways, The Anne Boleyn is a really nice, spacious and super well decorated establishment. We came here on a Saturday morning for brunch, and it was quite relaxing. They have a lot of space inside and outside on their patio. We had the choice of which area to sit in and I wish we had chosen \"The Library\". The library has floor to ceiling bookshelves adorned with many old books. There was no one seated there when we arrived, so we could have had that nook to ourselves. Next time! The rest of the space was equally as nice in its own right with plush bar stools, round about booths and gold tables. The silverware is also especially detailed and nice. The place felt stylish but comfortable. Several TVs were playing soccer and football games.   I had the Full English Breakfast for brunch ($17) and a mimosa. It came with a large slice of toast, eggs (sunny side or over easy), mushrooms, tomatoes, brown beans, pork sausage, hash browns and bacon. It was delicious. I forgot how much I love brown beans at breakfast. Everything was fresh and piping hot. The hash browns reminded me of the ones at McDonalds but I'm not complaining, those are my fave. I wish they had mustard with the pork sausage, I didn't think to ask. Coffee was pretty good, but they don't have cream, only homogenized milk. I was let down at first because I really hate milk in my coffee, but was pleasantly surprised. It actually tasted fine! My mimosa was also delicious. Note: they are unable to serve alcohol before 11, so we had to wait about 10 minutes to get our boozy brunch beverages. Say that three times fast. Oh, and the caesar was good, but fyi spicy for those who have a somewhat sensitive palate to it.   The service was pretty good. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, but there was a couple times we would run out of coffee and water and had to ask for it. Which is usually fine but I was dehydrated and headachy, ok, hungover and really needed it. They ended up leaving a pitcher of water on the table which was appreciated, and would still come back to help fill the glasses which was nice.   Verdict: I would come back for brunch or even lunch/dinner; and to try more cocktails. They have quite a few solid choices.   Space: 5/5 Food: 4/5  Service 4/5"}
{"text":"Been getting the mad cravings for a proper English breakfast, and this place definitely delivered.  The good: - Friendly staff - we came in and were made to feel right at home by a very friendly hostess who chatted with us, explained the background of this restaurant (the owners wanted to bring over British pub culture, and create a cozy spot for locals/regulars) - Lots of european football on TVs.  - Comfy half-circle couch seating.  - High ceilings, posh decor, very airy and nice natural lighting  - English breakfast was delish. Beans and mushrooms were packed full of flavor, toast was perfectly toasted with butter.  The other stuff: - Brunch was on the pricier side for my wallet (Well - you decide: $17 for a full breakfast, although other items like eggs benny start at $13.) - I'm not sure how I feel about Anne Boleyn, but there are a lot of pictures of her so *shrug  Overall, really good comfort food and has a real chill vibe despite the posh interiors. Would definitely come back with friends."}
{"text":"Looked up this place which had reasonable reviews because of its location and clientele. No reservation and showed up to find the place packed to the rafters because of the hockey and basketball games being televised - all local Toronto teams playing so EVERYONE was out!! The hostess managed to pull a booth out of thin air (she must have had magic powers) and we got a spot within 3mins of showing up. Waitress was pretty quick off the mark and at our table. She was very nice, although hard to hear with the extremely loud cheering crowds inside. Food was pretty good - its an English pub and while it has lots of English stuff in it, its still an American bar.. Beer was ok - nothing special despite us trying several types. Just nothing really spectacular. Food was nice - had the bangers and mash - which I love - however, their mash was overly whipped and too soggy (and the pet & gravy made it that little bit extra slurpy!). My colleagues had the buttered chicken (which got about a 5-6 from my mate on flavor) and a house burger, which got the   from my other colleague.. (it even looked really good too!) We didn't stay long after dinner, as it was too hard to have a conversation, so we paid out and braved the weather and found a bar that was quieter so we could hear ourselves. Overall, this place would have been great had it not had 2 national sports playing on one night.. We had no idea so we picked the AB as it was close to out hotels."}
{"text":"An upscale British pub where you watch the leafs play while enjoying a nice drink and dinner. We walked in at 9 and didn't have to wait to get seated. Lots of energy at this bar! Very cozy and tastefully decorated."}
{"text":"I went there recently for a bit of a last minute Saturday brunch with a few friends who were visiting from out of town. My girlfriend had also learned that it might be a favourite spot for Prince Harry, so she was hoping to run into him. Sadly, there was no Prince there. Although we had a lovely time.   We were a party of 6 and they gave us an option of where we wanted to sit. Outside, beer hall, or library. The beer hall with all the TVs tuned to English football matches and all of the fans watching intently so early in the morning made for a really nice atmosphere.   Two people in our group had gluten sensitivity and the server and chef were very accommodating with making substitutions to help out and still give everyone a great brunch. The Full English was a pretty popular dish in the group. And I have to say, that's what I intend on getting on my next visit. The baked beans looked so good. I had the Corned Beef Skillet and it was delicious. I recommend it. A friend had the pancakes and they looked like they could feed 6 people. Fluffy and very tasty.   I look forward to going back again. Although my only concerns with the service was that they bad no coffee cream (half and half). I know it is more of a North American thing so for perhaps authenticity's sake it isn't offered. The milk they serve is full cream (3.25%). I also would have liked some jams/preserves with the toast that comes with some breakfast options. And Brown Sauce for the sausa9ges.   Along with the quality brunch fare and the nice selection of beers on tap to enjoy after 11am, they make a killer caesar. I'm not a fan of vodka in it and they were happy to make it a bourbon caesar instead. If you haven't had one yet, go ahead and try it. I'll wait."}
{"text":"Part of the revamped Richmond and Peter intersection, Anne Boleyn is a new British pub at the base of a tall, black, and boring condo at the south east corner.   I've been here three times now - all for brunch. So far, I've been impressed. Prices on some items are a smidge high, but overall the quality of food has been good. The pancakes with apple are tasty if you're looking to go sweet, while the eggs benny is a solid option if you're craving that salt life. I've also tried the classic English - pricier, but you get a crapload of food. My only issue with this is the bacon - I found it to be a tad tasteless compared to standard strip bacon, but otherwise it was the filling, greasy breakfast I was looking for.  Shout out to the decor in this place - it definitely gives off more of that \"upscale pub\" kind of vibe, and overall looks nice. A solid pub option in the area for sure."}
{"text":"This place is just below my office so I've been here a few times for work related team lunches. Its always good and the staff are clearly familiar with the needs of the working lunch crowd - e.g. putting a rush on one person's food because they have to duck out early to another meeting, and not looking annoyed when everyone just orders water and coffee because they gotta leave and do life immediately after eating.   Mostly pub staples with a bit of a twist, this place also changes up a few menu items every few months to keep things fresh. Most recently I ordered a new addition to the menu - a Waldorf salad - and it was very good. Fresh lettuce, crunchy nuts and grapes, creamy blue cheese, and not too much dressing. A good size to leave you full but not too full, you know? I also ordered fries for the table and the biggest bowl of fries I've seen in awhile landed on our table. I was envisioning a side fries sort of thing and it was way more than that. I felt bad leaving so many in the bowl at the end of the meal. If your group is famished and very into fries though, they'd be the perfect size.   The space is also relatively cozy considering its located at the base of a condo - they've done a good job with the decor. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area and looking for something satisfying to sit down to without spending a crazy amount."}
{"text":"I didn't come here for food but just stopped by for a drink. This pub was always on my list since it opened but I was never in the area to go check it out. Finally, I had a chance this weekend. Like they claimed, this English pub is known for showcasing Anne Boleyn on the walls and other art. The pub also has a private area that has a bookcase as the backdrop which is really nice. Comfy red leather sofas and wooden stools can be seen throughout the pub. The ceilings are nicely done too and it's very spacious in here.   I recommend you to come have a drink and check this place out! Lots of pictures adorn the walls for you to admire while you have a drink or even a meal. Like I said in my tips, they open at 8:30 am on Sundays so you can have a nice breakfast bright and early!! Or even, consider this spot another brunch spot to go to with your friends and family!"}
{"text":"My first meal of 2018 was brunch at The Anne Boleyn on New Year's Day! Admittedly, I didn't have a lot of options because a lot of restaurants were closed on New Year's Day. I've walked past this British pub a dozen times and always wanted to try it out, so it worked out perfectly that they were open for brunch.  Given that it was Jan 1, it was a fairly quiet day at the restaurant. Service was a little bit slow, but again, it was a holiday so it was understandable. We ordered the English Breakfast and a mushroom toast. I was a little surprised that they could only serve the eggs in the English Breakfast sunny side up or over easy, but not scrambled (how hard is it to scramble an egg?) As well, my friend had ordered her eggs over easy, but they came sunny side up. We didn't make a complaint because the over easy eggs at the table next to us did not look too appealing.   Service hiccups aside, the food was good and reasonably priced for a downtown brunch spot. I would come back again on a normal day when hopefully service will be better."}
{"text":"Spurned by Barhop due to lack of seating, we ended up at this place. Not too busy so we got service rightaway.  The interior looks kind of regal as suggested by the name, it's definitely a fancy pub that serves a change over the regular places.  The beer menu is not amazing but the cocktails look interesting. It's located at a nice spot away from the core, so expect to find it less busy on weekdays."}
{"text":"Went there today for brunch, had a cappuccino and Full English Breakfast. Coffee was meh, but the food was quite an experience. The portion size was great, and it was a proper full English, beans mushrooms, hash browns, toast with ham, over-easy eggs (you can also get sunny side up), and the sausage. Service was nice and pleasant. Good experience for brunch, with great interior decor."}
{"text":"I didn't have any food there, but the place is beautiful and the service was great (despite many complaints about it on Google). All the food that I saw being brought out from the kitchen looked and smelt wonderful so I will definitely return to try the food."}
