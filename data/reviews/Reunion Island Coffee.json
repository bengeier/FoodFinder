{"text":"The coffee isnt good, its poured out of a warmer. I dont get it. 
Its way too loud and cold. Some wood or fabric would do this place good. 
The ham and cheese croissant wasnt able to be heated up. So i had a slab of ham and hard, sweating slab of cheese on a croissant. 
It was just under $7. The small coffee was basically an espresso cup so had to get the regular size which most places would deem as small. 
Ugh. Ill stick to every other coffee shop in the area."}
{"text":"First off: the coffee is good. But so is the coffee at the other coffee-centric cafes in the neighbourhood. 

And they won't do a pourover if they're busy, which was disappointing.

But the big problem is that the space is unbearably loud.

They (smartly) tore out all of the leftover-from-second-cup decor that the previous cafe here had, but they've replaced it with blank walls, hard floors, hard chairs, tile, nothing at all to absorb the sound. I've been three times, and every time I've left to go to another cafe because of the loudness.

It starts with loud music, and then any table where people need to have a conversation have to talk over the music, and the next over them, and so on. And with all the tables facing the narrow direction, all that sound bounces right back. Whether you're alone or trying to have a conversation, it's  frustrating. 

Lit down the street gets as many tables in, but with some soft surfaces and facing the tables the long way and not having to talk over music, there's no problem.

The coffee is good, the wifi is good, the staff are nice. If somehow they solve the noise problem, I'd love to swing by regularly. But right now it's just too noisy to bother."}
{"text":"This is some of the best coffee in the area. I love getting the almond milk lattes. The staff are always super nice. I am pretty much addicted to the croissants as well. Super trendy minimalist decor. They also have some pretty cool take-home products as well."}
{"text":"They're still a new cafe and have some growing pains. You can tell. It's not all bad, don't misunderstand! Here's my rundown.

The good:

Great coffee
Tasty baked goods, including some stuff from Bunner's Bake Shop for the vegan/gluten-free folks in the 'hood
Friendly staff
Yummy take on a cold brew: cold brew + tonic water
Prices on par with other cafes in the 'hood
Lots of plugs for the laptop crowd
Decent wifi

The not-so-good:

Tend to run out of food, especially the Bunner's items. 
Won't do pourovers if it's busy

The bad: 

It gets very, very loud in here very easily. The place is designed with almost nothing to absorb sound: hard surfaces everywhere, no fabric or sound absorbing in sight. So all it takes is one table of loud talkers and it's a problem. They tend to play loud music, which doesn't help at all.

I like it here, it's a good addition to the 'hood and a good place to go if my fave local is super busy. But I'm hoping they can fix some of the issues, especially the noise problems. Then I'll drop by more often!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were in here today and it was great! Great service, good coffee, and a nice atmosphere. The manager was super friendly and even though we stayed a bit past their closing time, he was still completely upbeat and understanding. Will definitely recommend this place and can't wait to go back! :)"}
{"text":"Very good coffee and pretty cool place, very well located on Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"Attitude! I asked for a machiato with cream  ... \"No we can't do that\" he said. I said, \"I have actually had this 3 times already here\". \"Oh okay I'll try\"..... I received a cappuccino even when I asked him to stop pouring The cream. I find the servers here not really interested in actually giving people what they want. For $3.50 and not getting what I want with apathetic service . No thanks -it will be my last visit here."}
{"text":"The pour-overs are sublime and I love the beans for coffee at home.  Still the new kid on the block with some kinks...I've had a few lukewarm Americanos that could have been more hot."}
{"text":"Open during Canada day weekend, I got my caffeine fill with a pretty latte art.  Good way to start the day.  Very smooth to the palette, just what I needed."}
{"text":"On a Sunday morning, this coffee shop has a very relaxed vibe, and a mix of locals as well as cafe regulars.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich, which comes from the place next door, but is delivered through a secret passage way from the back room.

The sandwich is easily the best take on the egg, cheese, and meat sandwich.  The bacon and kale contrast nicely with the cheddar like cheese and the muffin is equally soft.

Coffee roast in the latte is noticeably darker in roast than the other cafes which gives this place a distinctive experience compared to the rest of the pack."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab and go or stop in for a coffee in Roncesvalles. Baristas are friendly and know the products inside and out. Wicked espresso and drip offerings and the best cold brew with tonic in town."}
{"text":"This is the cafe that Roncy deserved and the cafe it needed. I had the chance to pop in to do a little work, have a little latte and eat a LOT of breakfast sandwiches (ok maybe just one, but I would have had 2-3 if I wasn't afraid of being judged).

It takes up a great location on a corner just towards the north end of the Roncy village. You walk in and it's beautifully set up with a more minimalist design, which makes the space look way bigger than your average coffee shop or cafe (dare I say even multi stroller accessible).

The real star and the main reason you should come here is for the Reunion Island coffee brewed beverages. Excellent bean selections depending on what your drink preference is. I went with a latte which was beautiful both in taste and in presentation - I still get a kick of the latte art flowers, so pretty.

The review would end here and I'd be content to give them a strong 4-star. But then, I was hungry, and I ordered, and it was far too good to not discuss in great detail. Rave even. I started with a chocolate croissant which was.... (insert millennial expression here - Lit, Fyre, #blessed), so flakey and wonderful and jam packed with chocolate. I was happy. 

...then I ordered their breakfast sandwich which you can have with bacon OR Kale... OR BOTH (so obviously I did that). HOLLLLLYYYYYYY SHITAKE!! Move over Bacon and Egg McMuffin, but like seriously GTFO, now - you've been my breakfast BAE for years but after having the breakfast sammie at Reunion Island... Who the EF is you? Bye Felicia. Hello Reunion Island breakfast sandwich. My new Ride or Die.

(I'm going hard on the Gen i/millennial expressions right now, bare with me, almost done)

It wasn't even a big one, and it didn't need to be, it was delicious, juicy even, a unique mix of flavours, textures that all worked together.

TLDR, come for the coffee, then *ahem* come for the sandwiches (get it).

Eatcrest out"}
{"text":"Get the cherry coffee iced tea. My review could honestly end there because that's all I need to say, but I will continue. 

RI are some of the best roasters in this city. They really care about the product and it shows. I'm so confused on how this coffee shop has anything lower than a 4 star rating because it is clearly a 5 star operation. 

Even when I move out of this area . I know I'm coming back just for this place. 

Okay gtg- literally going there right now!"}
{"text":"Average coffee shop. $2.75 for a tea is a bit expensive. Staff is friendly. The place is nothing exceptional but a nice place to be for an hour or so."}
{"text":"Great coffee, rad tunes, nice staff, highly instagrammable, clean, attractive design. If you're in Roncey, you can't do better."}
{"text":"Overall, it's a fancy looking Second Cup. Pass on this and go to Cherry Bomb instead."}
{"text":"This place was OK, nothing supercozy or mindblowing, area (Roncesvalles) is nice. My latte was good, but not one of these times where you take the first sip and think \"YAAAAAAS\".

I remember the chairs being not very comfortable, I missed some fluffy chairs or sofas where I could chill for a bit."}
{"text":"I think this place has lots of haters as well. 
I enjoy their coffee. 
The layout is simple and clean. The place has a vibe that helps keep Roncy on the map."}
{"text":"I love minimalist aesthetic. Bright, clean, and spacious. And most importantly: serving the best Americano I've had on Roncey. A much needed addition to the 'hood. Thanks for opening up, guys."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time recently. I had a regular filter coffee and my boyfriend had a cappuccino. We also got two herb and cheddar scones.

I'll start with the positive. People were friendly and the scones were tasty.

But, the cappuccino tasted sour. We weren't sure if it was \"supposed\" to be like that or not. My filter coffee was no better than what I can make at home.

Overall, we were very disappointed and we won't be back."}
{"text":"I was very fascinated by the \"coffee\" tile design at the entrance of the store and stopped to take a picture. When I looked up, I found the staff giving me judgemental looks. As I opened the second door and was taking in the atmosphere of the store, I was interrupted by an annoyed \"Uh... Can I help you?\" from the girl at the cash. Rude. I wouldn't give a full review on the coffee and food I purchased because I'm sure it's biased by their bad service, but stick to coffee and don't try their teas."}
{"text":"Most important bit - the coffee is fantastic. Really, their cortado has been consistently better than the Lit or most other coffee shops in the area or elsewhere. I really cannot say anything bad about the coffee, its' delicious and well made. If that's all you care about, ignore the rest of the review. If you consider atmosphere and character to be as important for a cafe, however, read on.

The venue leaves a lot to be desired. They've completely overhauled the interior; a necessary change that they blew spectacularly, in my opinion. The new setup is completely sterile, and the combination of old-time hospital tile with oppressively white walls deprives the space of any potential character or emotional attachment. The echo in the now large space can be deafening, and the people behind the counter appear more like assembly line workers than baristas. 

The joint advertises itself as a \"coffee laboratory,\" where new baristas are trained and new ideas are tried out for a willing audience. Maybe this will be the case, but right now the RICB is just another coffee shop on a street full of 'em, and given how off-putting the atmosphere can be, I wonder how long it'll last. The new owners have created a space without the potential for any sort of community while holding to underwhelming irony as a substitute for character and ambiance."}
{"text":"Great and very consistent flat white. Never failed me! 
I've also tried the ground coffee and it's solid.
The staff is always cheery and the space is inviting although a bit echoy.

One of my favourite thing to do in warm weather is to sit on the benches out front with friends to catch up and people watch.
Dear Reunion Island, please please finish your side patio. Will be there everyday in summer."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, service quick. 
What can you say about a coffee shop....? Flat white was very good, will return."}
{"text":"Quite a stroll from me, but well worth it!  I look forward to going back.
Very bright, open space.  The decor is trendy and simple.  There is lots of seating, but it never feels claustrophobic or too close for comfort with the people beside you.  The coffee and pastries were delicious and fairly priced.
The area and the shop had a layed back vibe which was great!  Count me in!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and pleasant staff! Disappointed by luke warm latte and a \"too-dense\" croissant  though  :("}
{"text":"Conveniently located on a prominent corner of Roncesvalles and Neepawa accross from the TD Bank.

The decor is clean and modern and the staff is very nice and knowledgeable. I was asked how how my coffee was since i was the first customer of the day and they wanted to be sure they got the brew right.

I had a their flagship blend coffee and it was mild and flavorful, perfect. The almond croissant was rich, it tasted more like a pastry then a croissant, awesome!

They take cash, credit card, and debit if its tap. I dont believe they have a standard point of sale machine to insert your card. Some negatives at least when i went was that the music was on the loud side and they have limited cafe food (e.g. muffins, bagels, etc.). But this place still ticks all the boxes."}
{"text":"Great coffee solid layout & cool decorations... I'm giving it only 3 stars though for one reason only & it's because the place was extremely cold, basically no heat on. Everyone's was sitting with their jackets on & it seemed owner couldn't care less to turn the heat up!"}
{"text":"Excellent third wave coffee in a beautiful, relaxing space with lots of comfortable tables and chairs and a well-coiffed Roncesvalles clientele. A good place to find inspiration for your next edgy haircut or cool outfit. The staff are warm, the light pouring in the windows is uplifting, and the self-serve water is plentiful. As spacious Toronto coffee palaces go, this is the more polished counterpart to Propeller's industrial-chic warehouse space to the northwest."}
{"text":"Great coffee but ok atmosphere.  Could do with a lounging area or at least a couch for comfortable and relaxed conversations."}
{"text":"A sip of their Island Reserve roast at The Federal restaurant got me instantaneously asking the waitress for the name of the coffee and then google where I can get my hands on some. I was super happy to find out it's a Canadian roster and they have a cafe in Ronceville so to Reunion Island I go! 

The atmosphere was quite chill but the decor didn't speak to me. Of course I didn't come here for the Decor, I grabbed a cup of their flag ship dripped coffee, almond croissant (not the best, very soggy) and a 12oz bag. It was a good day.  

Since our visit to Reunion island cafe, we have became a member and ordered a few of their different blend online. You get free shipping if you order over $59 or you can ship it to the store for free pick up.  It's good coffee folks!!! Get some."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... 4 stars easily for the place itself provided you can find a seat.  Laptop city!

Reunion Island Coffee is a stalwart on the Toronto coffee scene.  They are a local coffee roaster with a few outposts but their Roncy location is the one most people know the best.  I've seen Reunion on many top Toronto coffee list and on a Sunday afternoon, I finally got to try it.  This particular cafe is fairly spacious.  I would easily say they have a number of tables ... provided the laptop horde doesn't park their butts and take up more seats than needed.  It is very quiet even on a weekend ... no one is speaking except for the occasional tinder date nearby.

The menu is a solid espresso menu with no seasonal offerings but they do have a decent amount of loose leaf tea to drink as well.  Also, they have a breakfast sandwich and a few treats to tempt you.  I have to admit, I was excited to see their slow drip iced coffee machine work in the background.  Service here is polite and efficient... we got our flat whites pretty quickly.

Flat White - Beautiful latte art topped a fairly good flat white.  I would say the flat white was made well but I think the beans weren't my favourite.  I dont think thats the barista's fault... I think the beans were just too acidic and fruity for my preference.  I did find it more on the sour side and lighter overall.  3.5/5

Tahini maple cookie - Ok, if you see this... get it.  It's really good and I normally dont eat cookies cause I always worried they're too hard or too sweet.  This is neither.  Its a crispy edged but tender on the inside ... just the right amount of maple sweetness without being sugary.  I love the tahini addition as it makes it more rich tasting.  Seeing how this was bigger than my hand, it definitely is more than enough to share... if you really wanted to! 4/5

Roncy has a few coffee spots but I think Reunion island has the better baristas to pull the espressos and also a nicer place to enjoy that coffee.  Maybe next time I'll try something different like a South American bean instead and see how the drinks fare!"}
{"text":"Latte was ok.  
Ambiance was ok.
It was just ok... Didn't find an ooomph to this Coffee House.  It was clean and decor was nice but a bit on the 'cold' front--maybe too hipster?"}
{"text":"The layout is beautiful. The counter is beautiful. 
The service is great. 
But the coffee, it's meh.  Not bad, but not great either."}
{"text":"Decor is clean and beautiful, but the atmosphere is cold. My friend and I did not feel comfortable here and the overpriced soy latte I ordered tasted sour. 
I will not be back here, here are plenty of other cafes in the neighbourhood that are welcoming with better drinks."}
{"text":"Located on Roncesvalles, Reunion Island Coffee is a great coffee shop to get some reading/work done, catch up with friends, or sit down to have a great cup of coffee. I noticed that quite a few people also ordered the breakfast sandwich from the shop next door (which I will do the next time I am there). The cafe eludes a very chill and relaxed vibe with simple decor. I ordered an Americano which was great. Will be back for more if I'm around the area!"}
