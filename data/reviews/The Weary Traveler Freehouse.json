{"text":"One of my favorite places in Madison.  Tons of character with good food and drink.  Service is good.  Bar is very cool."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler is a great place to go if you are looking for delicious food, great live music, and a laid back venue. I was originally in the mood for something light, but was persuaded by the waitress to try the restaurant's famous Bad Breath Burger. Although it ended up being a lot of food, the switch was definitely worth it. The burger consisted of traditional burger toppings, with a unique twist. Be sure to save some room for desert because the restaurant offers a variety of unique ice cream flavors, in addition to other options like Key Lime pie!"}
{"text":"great tofu soup! yum! A bit crowded/cramped in between tables..."}
{"text":"I've been to the Weary a few times now and I love it! Great local organic food, simple menu but I don't need much when what they do serve is so good. The bad breath burger is deliscious. Great vibe inside as well, low lighting and cool interior decorating. Good selection of beers on tap as well. If you're getting dinner on a weekend especially expect to wait a long time unless you arrive early."}
{"text":"I came here while visiting from Portland, OR and was impressed with the ambiance and variety of the beers.  While I don't drink, my cousin and uncle both had a few pints and were very happy with the selection.  The food menu is simple but eclectic with everything from burgers to sea scallops to meat/cheese plates.  The atmosphere is definitely one of a neighborhood watering hole/gathering place.  The decor is dark and on the English pub side and very inviting.  Overall I think it is a great place to meet up with friends for a few drinks and a great dinner without having to spend alot."}
{"text":"Great place for late night food on the near east side.  It tends to get pretty crowded on weekends, but the drinks are good and the food is great.  The one drawback is that the menu doesn't change much.  On the other hand, if you are out late on Willy street, this is pretty much the best option."}
{"text":"I really like it here! This was where I had my first date with my now husband! :) My only complaints would be that I wish the menu were a little bit more varied and that it were easier to get a seat! There is sometimes quite the wait on the weekends! All the food I've tried has been good and I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"GREAT beers on tap, and the oh-so-delish charcuterie plate (featuring selections from Underground Meats) is a showstopper.  Super-loud on Friday nights, but the people watching, suds, and food make it all worthwhile."}
{"text":"In the process of relocating to Madison from Indiana, my wife & I stopped in for lunch after a soul-draining day of house-hunting.  The brews on tap were perfect to take the edge off, and then I ate something I never expected to love so thoroughly -- a fried egg sandwich.  This was the best fried-egg sandwich in the world.  And I've eaten and made quite a few.  The secret has got to be that chipotle mayo.  It's the new ketchup -- it just rocks everything it touches.  And of course, the Weary Traveler is adorable with its beautiful dark woods, the mirrors up in the crown molding, and the delectable selection of local beers.  Saving the weary, one pint at a time..."}
{"text":"Cool little joint!!! Great food and drinks. Perfect for a date night or an evening out with friends."}
{"text":"The Weary has a great atmosphere and very good food.  Much is made of the Bad Breath Burger, and rightly so, but don't overlook the West of the Andes sandwich.  Good anyway you have it, but particularly with the roasted vegetables.    The only problem with the Weary is that it's so great, that it's often busy.  Worth the wait though.  A great late night option too.  ****The map shows the wrong location of the restaurant***** It gives the right address, but shows it right off the capitol square - not so!  Put the address into google maps."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place. I live around the corner and after a dozen meals and lots more beers, I've yet to have a bad meal or dining experience.  5 stars.  And as a weary traveler (aging backpacker with over 40 countries under my belt) it's refreshing to take a piss and see maps and tourist pamphlets pasted to the walls. Though dudes don't really dig it when you're at a urinal and you point to a spot on the wall and say \"I've been there!\""}
{"text":"a neighborhood must.  food is delicious and the atmosphere is unique and exciting.  great rueben and kombucha.  The bad breath burger used to be my favorite, but lately i think it's too much burger..."}
{"text":"Normally, the service here is good; I have regularly taken guests here. However, this past Sunday my family from Texas and I experienced horrendous service.  The five of us arrived at 11:45 AM for lunch right behind a similar sized party and were told to sit where we wanted.  We sat in the room next to the door on Willie Street and were served water fairly quickly.  That was the best it got.  A little more than five minutes later, our drink order was taken: three alcoholic drinks.  About seven to eight minutes later, our drinks were brought out by our waitress.  She was about to ask if we were ready to order but noticed we had no menus, stated so, and then left the table.    After five more minutes (I am not exaggerating about these wait times) I saw here delivering food, not menus to our table.  I went to the bartender and asked for menus stating that we had been there a while and did not have any yet.  He gave me the last three he had, and about four to five minutes later, the waitress arrived with two more.  By that time, three of us had a chance to look at the menu and find something to eat.  My brother was not ready, so we (mistakenly) asked her to come back.  Another five minutes passed, and she finally returned.    After waiting about 40 minutes and not having our food come out yet AND watching the party that came in when we did leave b/c they were done, I asked the bartender if the manager was around.  He stated he was the closest thing to a manager, and I told him our situation.  He said he would look into it and soon came to our table apologizing, stating that it was \"lost in the shuffle.\"  Our food took another 20 minutes or more to come out.  We had been there over 1.5 hours by now.  When the check came, they gave us 50% off.   This level of service is unacceptable. Will I go back?  Maybe in another six months to a year."}
{"text":"Walleye sandwich + Czechvar for the win.  You bet I'll be back to tackle the Bad Breath Monster, mints in tow."}
{"text":"The bad breath burger is great.  If you ask them they will substitute blue cheese for the cream cheese and it is fantastic.  The ruben is very good as well.  Their menu doesn't change much however.  If there were more rotating selections i'd probably give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good menu and great beers on tap. Get there early or expect to wait for an hour minimum."}
{"text":"I like the Weary and it's a good standby place to meet friends. The atmosphere is cozy, it's nice enough to go for a casual date or to meet your friends from the other side of town that don't always head to the near east side. Yet, it is not too fancy so you feel ok going there in jeans and a t shirt. Pretty good beer list and there are a few great things on the menu. But it seems that the menu never, ever changes. And the specials are always the same two things. I understand sticking with menu items that are popular but I think it is time that the Weary do a little updating."}
{"text":"Friday night, 8:00 -- busy enough that we got tipsy while waiting for a table.  Worth the wait? Absolutely. Very fresh, tasty food. The Andes sandwich hit the spot, and the (super garlicky) potatoes were better than fries any day.  Even though the wait was long and the bartender was busy, he was was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Outstanding, out-of-the-ordinary pub food, great atmosphere, good drinks. A little cramped on weekends and I think they don't heat the bathroom because no matter how warm with drink I am I always lose a finger or two whenever I have to pee.  Food-wise, skip the Mediterranean platter and the ghoulash and go for the generously splittable cheese and meat platter, the veggie salad, whatever the first sandwich option is (definitely with tuna!) or the Thai-something-something soup.   Sadly no longer carries Delirium Tremens beer."}
{"text":"Mostly great food. Love the small menu as big ones make me crazy and I can't ever decide quickly."}
{"text":"Came here my very first night in Madison and returned many more times -- mostly to drink (good selection of local beers on tap), but the food is excellent. Try the veggie chili with cornbread for something different. Plenty of decent-sized tables if you're with a big group but you're gonna wait a goodly while for one on weekends."}
{"text":"This place is probably alright if you're there for a few drinks on a weeknight with some friends, but don't come here for the food or service.    My gf took me here while we were visiting this past week because she used to come here often when she lived in Madison. I expected a decent meal.   I ordered the pork chop special and it was both overcooked and horribly lacking on meat. I sent it back and ordered the carne asada which was horribly undercooked.  Uhhh...no deal/discount on the meal either which any decent restaurant would at least offer if they wanted your repeat business.  The waitress admitted that the pork chop was the worst she'd ever seen.  Lame. Tell the cook then and have the manager work on that.  Poorly managed place with sub par service staff. Definitely won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Excellent food good drinks and a great atmosphere. While I've never had a bad meal here the Reuben is out of this world! Friendly and efficient batenders and wait staff. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"One of my most frequented haunts. The entire menu is locally sourced or house made. Delicious non-pretentious comforting cuisine and an ambiance to match. I love to go in the afternoon and sit with one of the available boardgames. My go to favorite menu items... West of the Andes with Tuna (best sandwich in Madison!) Carne Asada, Tom Ka Soup, Reuban. Knowledgeable staff with pretty consistent service."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler is the hands-down best restaurant in Madison. From the atmosphere to the appetizers (not to mention the Carne Asada - definitely in my top 3 favorite meals), this place is a must-visit.   Sure, there's the wait time to get a seat on a weekend night, but the vibe is good and people are generally quite friendly. They've got board games in the back and the beer is always excellent (everytime i go, they've got bell's oberon, so i'm grateful).   5 stars. Mmm, maybe we should go tonight ..."}
{"text":"Would be 0 if I could. Walked in, was told to seat ourselves then told to move once we did because during a non rush time they wanted tables reserved for larger parties. There was nobody in the restaurant. Menus casually thrown at us at a table that was too small for 2, while manager was reading a newspaper and eating behind bar. Get your crap together."}
{"text":"I am torn with this review. I go here all the time, I love the place, nice menu, really cool bar and atmosphere.  Here comes the BUT..... Can they please sort out the kitchen. About 25% of my visits result in a wait time of at least 45 minutes for food and subsequent cold food!  I can nearly predict when it's going to be cold and it's correlated with a long wait time. The potatoes are often stone cold. Last time I went I had the walleye sandwich and I had to ask the waitress if this sandwich was supposed to be cold because the fish was so cold I wasn't sure! They did comp us for a round of drinks because my girlfriends steak was undercooked.   I love this place but I hope a owner/manager reads this because they seriously need to sort out the management of the place during busy times, its a joke!   Oh and one last thing, how can I forget, during the winter, in the left hand corner by the door, it is freezing! There is a draft colder than the potatoes they serve and that's cold! Seriously though I've watched people throw jackets, hats and scarves on during their meal because of it. All that negative STILL doesn't out weigh the positive."}
{"text":"I like it, I love it, I want some more of it.  I don't know what that was, but I guess I am just excited about Weary Traveler.  Great food, trusty drinks, and a wonderful staff.  The carne asada is so, so, so good.  I am drooling just thinking about it.   Besides the food, they have a decent beer list, interesting mixed drinks, and the bartenders are happy to make you any other drink that you fancy.    I love the interior of this bar/restaurant. Every wall is covered with odd things to look at.  If that doesn't keep your interest, you can play one of the many board games that they offer.    This place is comfortable and the staff is so welcoming that I often frequent the Weary by myself for a solo dinner and a glass of wine.  I hear that the Bad Breath Burger is out of this world, but I have always been on a date when I thought about trying it."}
{"text":"What can I say about the Traveler that hasn't been said? I dunno, but here it goes. I'm a huge fan of the Weary Traveler. Unfortunately, I now live 1000 miles away, so I don't make it as often as I'd like to. My absolute favorite thing when I DO get to go is their Reuben. I've been all around the country, and a Reuben is usually my go-to sandwich, and I can say without a doubt that the Traveler's is the BEST. I'm also a big fan of the cheese plate (always a must for the appetizer. why? because CHEESE, duh!)  Great beer selection, the Goulash is pretty amazing too. (not the pasty elbow macaroni, hamburger and ketchupy sauce that most people I've known call Goulash) The only (very minor) complaint I have about the place is the seating. They get busy and fill up fast, and the tables are very close together. I'm a big guy, and sometimes I need a little space, although the last time I was there, my group and the group at the table next to us just ended up melding in to one SUPER AWESOME MEGA SUPER GROUP! yeah, it's just that kinda atmosphere. It's trendy/hippie/sconnie fab, and I can't wait to get back there."}
{"text":"Local place for locals. You can play board games while you eat/wait for your food and they have good beers. It has a great atmosphere to share with friends but wouldn't come for their food (although their bad breath burger is garlicky and delicious)."}
{"text":"I tried this place last night. The space is fun and has playful decorations like lamps made from old telephones. The room handles the noise of a bar quite well. The service was a little...disorganized and spacey, but I couldn't tell how much of that was because of the two side entrances (as opposed to their usual front) during the construction on Willy Street.   For dinner, I had the pork chop with an orange- white wine sauce, which was solid-- very tender and with good flavor. My husband had the vegan chili with bacon. He thought it was wonderful; i thought it was good ,but not as good as my uncle's, and lacking in spice and fullness."}
{"text":"West of the Andes - best sandwich in Madison! Too bad it doesn't come with fries. Their garlic potatoes are great though. Do yourself a favor and check out this gem."}
{"text":"Five of us arrived for dinner Friday night around 8pm.  The wait was longer than expected and was explained as many patrons having paid but not leaving.  We sat at a table for 7-8, rather huddled at one end in order to hear each other talk!  The food was very good - Bad Breath Burger, Ruben sandwich, Pork chop, and all with delicious sides, and the pricing seemed fair.  Tap beer was excellent.  I did not like two hot, after dinner drinks that I tasted - a buttered rum drink was not hot, and something with Framboise and Godiva liqueur smelled plastic-y.    If the server had been more engaging and attentive, and the noise level a bit quieter, I would certainly recommend another go.  But, as I told my spouse who was not with us last night, there are some fine pubs around town these days, so we'll save this one for later, perhaps much later."}
{"text":"It's not really my place on a Friday or Saturday night, but for a weekday lunch, YES!  The South of the Border snack plate?  OMG!  Pickled veggies, great guac, love!  The West of the Andes Sandwich is my total favorite, you can get it with steak, tuna or veggies.  It has just enough kick to keep you interested, and the salad with it is simple but great.  Their fried potatoes are magic, and the Vegan Chili (you can add meat to it) is also very tasty.  I like the atmosphere and the drink selection changes often.  It's a very relaxed, calming place (at least during the day).  The Weary is my favorite place on Willy St.  It's super cool they feature local products and even though I'm not funky or hipster, I've never felt unwelcome here."}
{"text":"The food is solid here, good vegetarian options (and non vegetarian options as friends and family have shared).  I agree that the menu could use some updating- I do take long breaks from here so I can re-appreciate the food after getting bored with it.  They offer specials, but I've yet to see any of their specials be vegetarian.  I know they change the beer/wine menu, but have yet to see the food menu updated.  Prices are good for the quality of local/organic ingredients offered and the portion size.  Also, on a recent visit I was informed that they donate a portion of their proceeds to the farm-to-school program on a certain day of the week (the details are hazy), but I do remember thinking that was a pretty upstanding thing to do.  It does get crazy busy and loud, especially on evenings and weekends- so be prepared to wait and they only have someone seating you on weekends, so getting a table can be hairy.  Once the anxiety of actually getting seated has passed, the food and drink make up for it."}
{"text":"Few places can combine the right food, drinks and atmosphere to create the perfect restaurant bar. The Weary has managed.   The menu has just enough class, the cocktail specials are always interesting, and who doesn't want to play a board game over grog and a bowl of hearty chowder?   I'd recommend a dish but they're all perfect. The Bad Breath Burger is a revelation."}
{"text":"The goulash was amazing. I wish my grandma had recipes like that. Unfortunately as good as the food was the venue does have its share of problems. It is very cramped inside with small tables. For a taller person with long legs I had to sit stretched out into the aisle and felt in the way. There was also a bit of a disturbance where the staff called the police to have an area man escorted out and the staff did not seem to know how to handle the situation."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times over the years, and the service is usually very good, and the food is usually great!  It's a small menu, but very high quality and good prices!  The atmosphere is great and unique.  I love the paintings on the wall.  My favorite is the West of the Andes Sandwich!  There can be a bit of a wait on busy weekend nights, but they get you in as fast as possible.  There are even board games to play if you want!"}
{"text":"I know everyone seems to love this place, but for me it comes up a little short. The decor is fab and quirky, with the tin roof and board game collection, but the food is kinda hit and miss. For one, it seems inappropriate for a hipsterish little bar in the heart of Willy St, there are relatively few vegetarian options that aren't salad. I love, love love the South of the Andes veggie sandwich, but the fact that it comes with a tiny salad means it doesn't make for the most satisfying of meals. That would be cool, though, if they had more appetizer-y stuff. You can basically get a greek plate (which is good but gets old) or chips and salsa and/or guac. Meh.   My husband loves the Bad Breath Burger of course. The vegan chili is good, but given how easy chili is to make, it's just not what I want to eat when I go out.  The beer selection is good -- in fact I much prefer the Weary as a bar rather than a restaurant.  We went once for brunch, and while the bloody marys were pretty good, I felt similarly about my meal that time (Andes Eggwich) as I usually do. In general the menu is decent, just not that expansive."}
{"text":"The burger that have everyone talking in the community, had to give it a bite!  May I say the BAD BREATH BURGER! The burger does have flavor, pretty creative with the addition of the cream cheese! I was expecting a little more out of this burger, the flavor was there. But it wasn't as juicy  and greasy, how a burger is suppose to be. I wish they've wouldn't have press the meat patty down to let out the juice while being cooked and secondly if the patty were to cook at a higher temp to seal in the juice. Everything would of been perfect, until we meet again. So long for Weary's! Service was excellent, give them around of applause!"}
{"text":"I lived a few blocks away from the Weary for about three years and definitely ate a lot of West of the Andes sandwiches and South-of-the-Border snack plates while there. It's a reliably delicious, very reasonably priced, hip-but-not-too-hip place to enjoy lunch, dinner, or drinks in the Willy St. neighborhood. Although the menu is limited, there really is something for everyone and the food's so good you don't mind having the same entrees over and over.  As a side note, if you ever take a class next door at the Perfect Knot yoga center (which you should!), you'll probably end up down dogging to the smell of roasted garlic, making it even harder not to be lured into the Weary after a Bikram class!"}
{"text":"Great friday night date-ish experience here.  But got there literally minutes before the rush of people mobbed the bar, and made me sad.  Played \"lost cities\", which they supplied.  I wasn't starving, and got a kids burger with carrot sticks and graham crackers.  Perfect."}
{"text":"What can I say about the Weary Traveler?  To start with, for such a small menu, everything, and I mean everything, on it is delightful.  The menu is as diverse as the people who frequent it with vegan, vegitarian, and omnivorous cuisine.  I personally recommend the Carne Asada steak.  The atmosphere reeks (in a good way) of a classic wanderer's stopoff, replete with wagon wheels on the wall.  Though some similar establishments can create sensory overload, the Weary Traveler thankfully falls short of the kitsch-y quality that is the trap of so many restaurants.  Plus, for me, it has the added incentive of being the place I met my soon-to-be wife."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like The Weary Traveler. From the reviews it seemed like an enjoyably quirky restaurant with good food and so I dragged the bf over. It was clearly a busy night so I didn't mind that we had to a) resort to asking a bartender how long the wait was and then b) flagging down the waiter after about fifteen minutes of standing around. He said a fifteen minute wait and invited us to sit at the bar, which we did. Almost exactly fifteen minutes later we were seated and five minutes after that we were given water and our very wobbly table was propped up. We both agreed that this guy was getting a very large tip and settled in to enjoy the atmosphere. It took about 20 minutes after that for our waiter to come back and take our order. No biggie, it was busy and he was clearly spread kind of thin. Another fifty minutes later we walked out without ever seeing our food. The final straw was that the table of four who came in around the same time we were ordering got all of their food before we did. The waiter came back at around the half hour mark with a half assed apology, not actually saying that the cooks messed up but vehemently protesting that it wasn't his fault. Between the very grumpy barstaff and the waiter who turned out too good to be true and possibly the errant cooks (although since everyone else managed to get their food in a timely manner I suspect the waiter was actually at fault), The Weary Traveler needs to work on their staff. While I didn't get to taste the food it smelled and looked heavenly!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start...  Well, first off, the atmosphere is absolutely the most comfortable neighborhood bar and restaurant. Not only do you feel at home, but you feel that you are just hanging out with a bunch of friends at home. Between the friendly and most welcoming staff and the cozy rustic feel of the place, everyone should feel right at home in this iconic Williamson Street corner meeting place.  Next, lets talk food... while the menu is small, don't be discouraged. The menu has been perfected because of its quaint offerings. Every item has been well thought through and meticulously blended to make this place a go to for specific wants. For example.. if I want a rustic, deep and dirty burger that only the most daring person would eat yet savor every bite... I would say, Weary's Bad Breath Burger takes the cake. I would never think about piling all those ingredients together at home but I am sure glad the the cooks (geniuses) at Weary did cause it is surely a staple of the establishment. Another perk of the Weary is that their menu is as diverse as the neighborhood that it serves; vegan, vegetarian and carnivore all in one place.  Overall, I would say this is one of my near east isthmus staple restaurants and always comes up in conversation when family or friends come into town. So grab a friend or two and head over to Weary; grab a expertly crafted cocktail, beer or coffee and something to eat and enjoy the best energy one could wish for while enjoying a morning/day/night out with friends."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler seems to have long been a restaurant fixture along Willy Street way much like Lazy Jane's and Jamerica.  Initially walking in you can start to see why, the walls have poems fragments sprawled across them, mood lighting, the atmosphere bustling, a nuanced decor with suspended bicycles and rotary telephones on some tables, and a marvelous looking old style crimson ceiling, all very appealing and promising.    Unfortunately the food left me cold, literally.  Learning after we ordered that the Carne Asada was out, my partner and I both switched choices to the famous Bad Breath Burger and the special of the day a pulled pork sandwich.  After a wait which was over thirty minutes, the food finally came.  The pulled pork sandwich was plain and simply cold, not even with the allusion that it had once been warm.  I also heard the person next to me remark the same thing.  Perhaps this is how it's done at the Weary but if so it was simply blah.  The slaw was just as flat as the pork, not juicy nor that flavorful and the bun was dry, stale, and overly bready.  The side salad was basically just plain greens with a tiny hint of dressing.  I wasn't expecting a BBQ style gargantuan but it was simply very lifeless and plain.    The burger was alright, I applaud the neat concept of adding cream cheese and some garlic and it was better cooked and tastier, but a burger is a burger; grill someone a piece of fatty meat how can it be un-tasty?  The service too was also fairly abominable.  In no way rude, just really slow, and unhelpful.  The specials weren't told to us and the board is fairly hidden, the food mysteriously took way too long, and it doesn't take 20 minutes to come pick up a credit card.  I don't think this was a fluke either as I observed these waiting phenomenon happening to other tables.    Perhaps having a very eclectic menu causes everything to sort of swim in mediocrity without honing in on something with precision.  I'm sure the Weary Traveler isn't as bad as I've made it out to be, the place is a staple afterall, but from my visit there it left me disappointed and weary."}
{"text":"Great diner. Kind of the new trend in midwest food, upscale bar food. Good food, especially the tuna steak sandwich and the beef stew. Its usually crowded on weekends and evenings so if you can, try to do a lunch in the weekend. Atmosphere is alright, dimly lit, which a bunch of random stuff on the walls. Similar to a outback or apple bees but more eclectic."}
{"text":"Have only been here a couple times. Both times food and drinks were better than average, while the service was slow and lacking. I'll definitely give it another shot, but maybe at a slower time of day.   RATINGS (A+  --  F) Service: C Food: B Drinks: B Price $: B Atmosphere: B Overall Experience: C+"}
{"text":"Comfortable like an old pair of slippers, and well worth dealing with the Willy street construction."}
{"text":"This place is always great and very consistent. Relaxing, dark vibe, interesting food selections and vegetarian-friendly. Best bloody mary I've ever had and I order them everywhere. One of the only places to eat at late at night in the near east."}
{"text":"One menu item...  Bob's (Organic) Bad Breath Burger...  You just HAVE to order this!!  Living up to its name, you will have bad breath for the rest of the night.  :)  But, it's definitely well worth it!!"}
{"text":"I am ashamed of myself for being in Madison for so long and never once eating at this place until today.  The food is as good as they come, especially, with the price of the meal being so affordable.  And the atmosphere is amazing with a small band that complements the cozy environment.  Not too loud and not too soft.  Although this was the first visit, the waitstaff was friendly even though I read on some of the reviews saying how they were not.  I've read that the menu has been around for a better part of the decade or so and some would argue that it's a bit limited on selection.  I would have to agree with that but they do excellent with the choices they dish out.    I love me some garlic but if you are not a garlic lover, I will have to warn you that at least of couple of them can be a bit overwhelming for some; especially the 'Bad Breath Burger' (the name says it all) and the side (salsa) from the 'Carne Asada'.  This is a type of restaurant I would highly recommend anyone if you're around the area or if you're planning to visit!  Here's another point of view from Seth Kugel's 'Frugal Traveler': http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/my-trip-to-madison-bikes-brews-burgers-and-a-bb/"}
{"text":"Snobby bartenders,good beer selection,cute waitstaff who are usually friendly, and the bad breath burger. If you dont order this,there's something wrong with you. Unless, of course, you are vegatarian, in which case they also have lots of options for you as well. The south o the border plate with homemade guacamole is fantastic, and the soups are tasty too. Just because I dont look like a professor with my hipster sweater knitted from the East Himalayan Mountain Yaks pubes, doesnt mean that Im not smart,and dont want a beer just as bad as everyone else."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to brunch today.  After ordering and waiting over an hour for food to arrive, was told it would be maybe 15 more minutes, got up and walked out. Very disappointing for my first trip to Madison."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler is a great example of the Willie Street (Williamson Street) vibe. The atmosphere is intimate and has a decor which seems to have been collected from over a life time with repurposed phones used as lamps and old mirrors covering the walls. They also have board games on hand in case you are planning on making a night of it. Which by the way i recommend!  They have a nice selection of Wisconsin beers on tap and the staff is knowledgeable about each one, so ask them if you are looking for a suggestion. The bartenders also mix a great cocktail if you are not a beer drinker.   The food is simply incredible. I have had many of their specials and almost everything on the regular menu. The Hungarian Goulash is my favorite winter dish because it warms you up without weighing you down. For lunch I would recommend the West of the Andes sandwich. And if you are not going to be around anybody you don't want to offend the Bad Breath Burger is the way to go. I've never had a hamburger quite like it. If you are with a larger group of people and can't decide on individual appetizers go with the Wisconsin Meat and Cheese Plate. I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had Bob's Bad Breath Burger. Tasted a few other dishes. The food was really good, the drinks weren't bad either. Service was nice and a great place to go to talk and have dinner with friends. My only gripe is that it was a bit loud."}
{"text":"Amazing place with a great atmosphere. Very comfortable and love the lighting/decor. The food lives up to what we've heard about this place and they have a great beer selection! Wish we had one of these in California! Will be back here every time we're in Madison again."}
{"text":"One of our favorite go to spots in Madison! The atmosphere is warm and cozy, friendly and quick service and flavorful food. The menu is a bit small but they are classics that never get old with local flavors. The Reuben, bad mouth burger or chicken dijonaise are some of our fav dishes.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Good food, NO SMOKE!  Hey, this place is probably worth going back to again!"}
{"text":"We have been hearing about the Bad Breath Burger for sometime and after the #MadCityBestEats came out we decided it was time to try.  This place swings and is a great little spot.  We split the roasted root salad which was fantastic.  The kitchen split in on to two plates for us.  We both ordered the Bad Breath Burger becasue I knew if I ordered something else, my better half would not be sharing very well!.  I'm glad I did, it was all that is cracked up to me.  Did someone say garlic?  If the burger doesn't get you then the potatos will.  Excellent.    We will be back for sure.  We noticed that the kitchen also stays open till ~1am which is great if you are looking for a late meal."}
{"text":"Such a fun vibe!  They make great Moscow Mules and manage to keep up with the constant crowd with quality service.  Love this place.  Not necessarily where you want to go for \"light\" fare but a fantastic spot for some comfort food."}
{"text":"Note to owners:  Please remove the huge raggedy potted plants from the front window.  They are super creepy like the kind you sometimes see in the windows of fading dry cleaning establishments.  Ordered the appetizer of chips and guacamole with pickled veggies.   The chips were obviously the dregs from the bottom of the bag (all small pieces and total crap).  Did the guac come out of a squeeze bottle?  And, please tell me. how do you ruin a grilled cheese sandwich.  I mean I have never had a dried out grilled cheese.  How do you do that?  And the quinoa-corn-bean salad didn't make our stop at the weary traveler any more memorable (or pleasurable).  Come on Madison you can do better than this when welcoming your weary travelers."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler is the most \"Madison-esque\" place around, great local atmosphere. This is my favorite restaurant in Madison! I usually get the black bean, corn, and quinoa salad but what makes it great is the steak you can put on top--very tender and lots of flavor. It is just delicious. My second favorite dish is the fish sandwich. Really everything I have had here is well done.  We recently found out that one of the employees makes his own ice cream and sells it in pints and quarts. The flavors are changing every day but they are delicious! So now we even get dessert here.     Note-the place is small and tends to fill up at dinner time on Friday nights--more so in the wintertime. Also it can get kind of loud in here so I recommend a beer to help tone the noise down a bit--they always have good beers on tap (wouldn't be Madison-esque if they didn't)."}
{"text":"I've eaten there many times and even though food is decent the service level is just simply bad.... recent lunch on a Sunday took 1.5 hours and we were served cold food. The server did not even apologize or offer to remake it, they simply microwaved it!  it is not worth the wait and the crowd, there are many much better places in town"}
{"text":"We're been here twice now and have not been disappointed yet! The Carne Esada is outstanding as well the Salmon. My absolute favorite was the catfish special with an amazing cream sauce over bismatti rice with tomato & kale - unbelievable! I just wish this was a regular item on their menu, it was one of the best meals I've had in a while. Very casual spot, great food & service! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I like many others have heard good things about this place.  It must be good of so many people like it that there is a 30 minute wait for a table of 4? We had to sit on a bench in a dark hallway toward the restrooms waiting.  Saw several customers attempt to get the bartenders attention only to give up."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere that fits well on Willy St., unique and flavorful food. Walleye is dependable, also enjoy the Bad Breath Burger. West of the Andes is a nice lighter option. Service is usually friendly, although they can be understaffed when busy. Really enjoy the versatility of the Weary--can be a good choice for couples looking for a date spot while also accommodating large groups comfortably."}
{"text":"I came here once as a weary traveler on a recommendation from a friend who lives in Madison.  I was stoked on the local kombucha served there and the available vegan options (Yeah, I'm that guy).  The burgers all looked legit also.  There were locally sourced items throughout their food and drink menues.  The place was covered in interesting memorabelia without the sense of trying too hard.  I enjoyed everything about this place."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place. Finally did but decided the hype it seems to enjoy greatly surpasses reality. While the food was okay, it wasn't great by any stretch. But, what bothered me most was the lackadaisical approach to service. I felt as if we were there for their convenience. Our wait person was slow  with the beverages and slow to come back. Seemed like it was very understaffed. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Bob's Bad Breath Burger is so amazing! The flavor combination dances on your palate. If I go too long without having this burger, I start to crave it to the point where I will drive up to Madison from Milwaukee just to get it. Wish they were open on Mondays as that's usually my day off, but oh well. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that I wish they had real French fries or other side options instead of the fried potatoes that accompany the burger. The accompanying side salad is also often underdressed. But oh that burger!"}
{"text":"I literally just finished swallowing my last bite of the Bad Breath burger and my god... I've lived in Madison my whole life, and this easily is the best burger I've ever had. Not even close.  Finally a place that has the guts to serve a burger medium rare (probably bc it's organic beef)."}
{"text":"It was our first trip to Weary Traveler on Saturday, July 27th.  We stopped actually due to the great ratings on Yelp!  But, we quickly found out that their food was a bit too \"organic\".  We all ordered and when the food came my friend found A LARGE BEETLE CLIMBING IN HER SALAD.  At this point I called over the waiter and he simply said that it was a \"natural\" salad and we should be glad that it wasn't dead, but that it was alive.  He also told us that the greens are organic and from McFarland.  I'm very happy that they use organic greens, but the question is if they wash them???  The worst part was that they offered to re-plate, but didn't give my friend her meal complimentary.  We obviously couldn't eat salad anymore, but instead had undercooked potatoes.  Very disappointing indeed.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great food. Great drinks. Not a secret. Recommended by locals, and I've extended the same to anyone heading to Madison and/or going to be near Willy St. Try a Jack Kerouac."}
{"text":"You literally can't order a bad thing on the menu.  My absolute favorite is the Bob's Bad Breath burger.  I'm not a big burger fan, but this one's my favorite in town, right under  The Old Fashioned burger.  The atmosphere is crozy and they even have games.  Servers are always friendly and know what they're talking about.  This place is a total gem--makes me proud to be a Madisonian."}
{"text":"I've had really great meals at the WT, but my most recent experience really failed.  My dining companion and I asked if we could substitute additional sweet potatoes for the artichokes on the roasted veggie salad.  The server indicated that would be fine.  When the salad arrived, the space where the artichokes would have been was empty, and the extra sweet potatoes were not there.  Lack of attention to detail!  We also ordered the Bad Breath Burger, which arrived undercooked. The potatoes on the plate appeared to have done an olympic swim in a gallon of oil.  Many of the pieces were burned.  These \"bottom of the barrel dregs\" should not have been served to a customer.  Lack of attention to detail!  Our server did replace the fried potatoes as we requested, but inidicated that's just how they are.  Not our experience in the past, but she seemed to think it was the norm.  I hope this experience was an anomoly, as it's a favorite place overall.  Please pay a bit more attention to detail in the food quality and presentation, consideration of customer.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"The Andez sandwich was the best I have ever had. The cotu de Rhone was really good too"}
{"text":"I have always been more than pleased eating at the Weary. There's a great atmosphere and great food. I was, however disappointed with the service for the first time ever on Friday, November 23, the day after Thanksgiving. I believe our waiter's name was Carl, and he was the most unenthused, unfriendly, bad waiter I've ever experienced next to high-schoolers at nasty chain restaurants, and that's giving high-schoolers a bad name. He messed up my brother and my drink order, which is hard to do since we were drinking the exact same thing, and it was very simple. He failed to bring us silverware before bringing our meals, and we had to wait at least five minutes for him to finally bring that to us. Never once did he come to check up on us to see how our meals were (and they were delicious, as usual, but that's besides the point). We both would have liked another drink, but he was nowhere to be found. When we finished our meals, it was another waitress, who was very friendly, who took our dishes away. To top it off, after waiting another five to ten minutes, he walked up to our table, sort of snapped the bill down, gave it a couple taps with his knuckles, and walked off, not saying a word. This was an opportunity to rectify his non-service, ask how things were, possibly ask if we needed anything else like another drink. No, he obviously wasn't interested in serving us any more, and obviously didn't care about his tip. The waitress who took our plates walked by shortly after we got our bill, and I told her she was a better waitress in just doing that than he had been the entire time we were there.  I've always had good to exceptional service at the Weary, and I've been there numerous times. The food has always been great, so no complaints there. It was the first time I've tried their Reuben, and it was phenomenal, made with the best pastrami I've ever had. I'm not one to write a lot of reviews here, but this instance warranted a review, and I hope the owners read this and take note. If I ever get this guy as a waiter again, I will immediately ask for someone else, or simply walk out."}
{"text":"Although the place was not full to the brim busy, service was incredibly slow.  Close to an hour slow.  Two of us ordered the West of the Andes which were reported as good.  One had the eggs and salmon which would have been better if it had arrived while the Bloody Mary still had ice.  Incidentally, poached eggs are not available probably because they might have fossilized before serving.  My Ace Burger was pretty good but not worth the wait.  There's a chance we might return but not a great one."}
{"text":"This carries the friendliness, neighborliness, ambiance, and charm of my ideal local watering hole. A visit here can only be full of romance."}
{"text":"The Weary is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Everything on the menu tastes fantastic. For my meal today, I had bob's bad breath burger and a glass of wine. The prices were really reasonable, the decor is fun, and the wait staff are really attentive and great."}
{"text":"I adore the weary traveller. It's a well kept secret from the college crowd, so the clientele are mature. The food is really terrific, and I gorge myself on chili, beer, and whatever else I can put down my gullet.  Another great feature of the traveler that really adds to the atmosphere when you're with friends is the stash of board games. It's a blast to play Trivial Pursuit, Apples to Apples, or Scrabble over drinks & dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Lots of tasty veggie options, and they use many local and organic ingredients. They also have a good selection of microbrews and plenty of local personality."}
{"text":"This was always my favorite Eastside bar. The old-style tin ceilings and the odd poetry on the walls always make this place a visual trip. They have a solid beer selection. Naturally, Bob's Bad Breath Burger is the best burger in town. And they have other great late night snacks. It's a true neighborhood hangout where you are likely to bump into friends. Hearing Catfish play some traditional Americana occasionally is a bonus.  Yes, the service sucks during rush hour, and you run the risk of slow service and cold food. But what do you expect at a popular establishment?"}
{"text":"I ordered Bob's Bad Breath Burger with a Wisconsin Meat and Cheese Platter with a Grilled Cheese Sandwich for the little one.  The food here was ok. It didn't leave overly impressed as the burger was bland and the side of potatoes were a bit on the heavy side (greasy). But, this is a little more unique of a spot with decent prices. The decor is very rustic, perhaps what you might stop for the night as a weary traveler back in the day... hence the name of the restaurant.  So if your in the area you could give it a visit and leave feeling like it was worth you time, even if you didn't looove the food."}
{"text":"The neighborhood is filled with great restaurants all along Willamson street. My son, and I chose to eat at Weary Traveler and were very impressed.The interior is dark and cozy with vintage decor. We ordered the Carne Asada and Bobs Burger. The Carne Asada was one of the Best steaks we have ever consumed. The burger was fantastic too. The side salad of fresh greens was tasty and plentiful. If only this Tasty Restaurant was located closer to home."}
{"text":"I love, love, love, love, love Bob's Bad Breath Burger!  It is the best burger I've ever had so far!  The meat is perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.  There's no tomoto-lettuce mumbo-jumbo on it at all.  It's got a few slices of melted cream cheese and then this incredible balsamic onion saute which totally makes my toes curl and my eyes role back in my head.  \"OMG, it's SO hella good..\" is all I can usually muster up when I'm stealing bites from my husband's plate.  Why oh why don't I ever order the burger for myself?!  Oh and one thing, it doesn't come with french fries but home fries (like the kind you'd get for breakfast)  which almost terrified me because I love french fries with my burgers.  Although I realized that the home fries aren't bad actually but you hardly need them because the burger is so dang good on it's own!  And if you're a vegetarian, the Mediterranian Platter (hummus, tabouli, flat bread and salad with feta, tomatoes, red onions, kalamata olives and yummy dressing) is delicious!"}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere, food was good but the selection was small. Ok with service until a recent phone call: I called to see how late their grill was open and I had to use my speakerphone (for reasons I'm not getting into here). I asked, he answered, there were no problems with communication that I could tell and after I said \"ok thanks!\" One might expect a \"you're welcome\" in return and end of phone call. Instead he rudely said \"turn your speakerphone off\" and slammed the phone. It was just completely unnecessary given that he never even had to ask \"what?\" once and even then it would have been rude in my book. Normally I'd just let it slide, maybe he's having a bad day and we've all been there, but what ever happened to common courtesy? 8/11/12 @ 8p"}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler is a great local Madison restaurant, with great fresh options! The service at The weary travelers is great! The servers were always helpful and nice! The food is great! I had the Carne Asada witch is a steak with a spicing seasoning and home Pico de gallo/Guacamole and a side of chips! The Carne Asada was spectacular with a great flavor and you can really tell it had a great seasoning! My friend ordered the Madison Grilled Cheese witch was really good with wonderful types of cheese and salad on the side. For dessert we had the Tres Leches and the kiLime Pie witch were outstanding, the dessert are locally made here by a Pastry Chef in town. The price is actually really good and very economic and you receive a great meal! I really liked The weary travelers and I hope to go again soon!"}
{"text":"Debating which is better, to have loved and lost or to have never loved before, omits the worst: to own the heartache of having willingly left the state of the Weary...  Seasonal brews never tasted so good as this: come in after working in the neighborhood, catch up with the frequent Travelers, stay for a fulfilling bite to eat.  On that last note, try everything on the menu your politics allow you to, then step outside your cuisine comfort zone and try some more.  Return as often as necessary.  If they start knowing you by name (and it's accompanied by a smile or a handshake) take a moment to appreciate life, then politely ask if you could have the walleye in the West of the Andes, or try a slice of cheese on the Canadian fish sandwich.  But all original, as-is menu items and chalkboard specials hit the spot at one time or another, so eat with reckless abandon.  There's something for everyone and every possible craving even if chocolate's your meal (although then you'll have to quiz the staff's memory on what perfectly sized, locally made confection is being offered that particular day/night).  If you're coming for the music, great.  If you get there a little late for the show, conveniently painted on the wall are some contemplative verses you can read and ponder over as you stand off to the side of the bar waiting for a spot to open.  Or you can see how many languages and places you recognize in the mapped washrooms.  Or you can pat yourself on the back for reading the changing fine print on the menu.  Or you can wonder why special cigar-smoking privilege is given to one Sanford DeWitt...    Knowing that last story and having a genuine connection to it makes my heartache for this place a little less wearisome.  Reminding myself I have not lost the Weary Traveler makes a trip home to visit all the more enticing."}
{"text":"Great good, great service. Had the eggs with flank steak and the seasoning was great-  grilled with a little spice."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a friday afternoon around 3pm. This being my first time in here, I came in not knowing what to expect of its seating and atmosphere. It was quiet though with its music playing at a resonable volume. I found a seat at the bar and was greeted by a friendly bartender. The Bloody mary came in a 12 oz glass and could have used more mix but I did not say anything. As I wait for my food I looke around the place and admired its old origionality from the bar to the tin ceiling and wondered how origional the hardwood flooring was as it appeared to be very worn. Dang I dig these old taverns and am saddened to see that these places like union house have to go. Madison still has plenty of them though. Finally, the reason I came in here, to try the bad breath burger. It came with  side of greens with dressing and some potatoes. Wow, I liked this so much I really want to come back and try the west of the andes sandwich that I have read some good reviews about. The burger definately rocked!"}
{"text":"This place has got it all. Great staff and servers putting out top quality endeavours for adventurous palettes. My grrrrl Amanda always hooks it up and the bartenders are always good for a few laughs. This is a classic Madison spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Real good.  I am having dirty thoughts about a had breath burger right now.  I'm going to move back to the Willy st neighbor hood Judi do i can eat them more often"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for lunch. Being that I was hungover, The Weary Traveller was the perfect spot be zen. It was quiet, dark and warm. They have a great selection of teas to choose from that come in a huge black mug that keeps your tea hot for your entire meal. I got the Eucalyptus Mint, but if I were to go back I would of got the Green Cherry. Me and my boyfriend each got a soup to start- me, the goulash, and him- the vegan chili. Both portions were HUGE and hearty and most importantly: delicious. My bf got the bad breath burger- he loved it so much he didn't even offer me a bite :( I got the sweet corn and quinoa salad and opted to get the steak. WOW THIS STEAK, melt in your mouth perfection. Quinoa salad tasted clean and felt like it was healing my sad hungover body. I wish we could have had dessert. And a beer. Maybe next time Madison!!!"}
{"text":"The food has always been good here. However, I have never had good service. That's enough to make me never go back.  I've consistently had waitstaff not pay attention to the table, take forever to serve or check on the table, and one time the waitress was rude to me because the bill was wrong!  There are so many great places to get food in Madison, you shouldn't waste your time on bad service at the Weary"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best meals I've ever had at a non-hoytee-toytee type place ... I highly recommend the corn, quinoa, bean salad WITH the local sirloin tips OMFG!!!"}
{"text":"I came up with my partner one weekend for a job interview, and our airbnb host had strong recommendations for this place. Lucky for me, I got the job and have now relocated to Madison, where I can get at the Traveler 7 days a week!  When I ordered the Bob's Bad Breath Burger, I was impressed to say the least. Enamored is probably more accurate. But then I thought, \"Well, that's probably just WI, right? Home of the utmost bovine quality, so this is probably the common standard of burger here.\"  Not so, my friends! The Weary Traveler remains the best burger I've had in Wisconsin, and/or my entire existence. The cream cheese sauce was clearly homemade and phenomenal. Furthermore, I realized that I may never have had burger outside of this place that was actually cooked medium rare. They have some cooks back there who know their stuff.   The ambiance is warm, cozy, and intimate. Service was decent and forgettable (but hey, the company I brought was sufficiently entertaining). However, the overwhelming charm of the entire affair, combined with a fantastic brew list (New Glarus Two Women, yes please), a home-y menu, and skilfully-prepared dishes makes this my #1 favorite Madison eatery."}
{"text":"The Weary, as it is affectionately known to us locals, is about as laid-back as a bar gets.  You'll think you are in Alaska.  Eclectic bits of flotsam and jetsam plaster the walls, though there is decidedly a design element involved - old doors and mirrors at character and interest to the walls.  The Weary is decidedly popular, you will never go there and find it empty and sometimes you may be put off by the small line of people waiting for tables.  The Weary has a ton of character, very good food, though I'm a bit tired of the menu, and a cast of neighborhood characters.  The place tends to veer towards the academic and the aging hippie, so if you are allergic to that type, best to stay away."}
{"text":"Great food, low prices!  This was our last stop on our Tour de Williamson street in Madison and it was a really great place!  We got a spot at the bar and decided on food and drink.  I got a drink with tequila and it was okay.  I think I was burned out since we'd been drinking for a quite a while.  In retrospect, I should have just had a glass of wine.  The wine menu has quite a few glasses that I like.  The star of the Weary Traveler is the food!   My husband is a big eater, and he doesn't deny it.  We decided on a Medium Meat and cheese platter and a ham and cheese sandwich.  The bartender told us to get a small since it was gigantic.  He was right.  It was a delectable large plate of nice meats, cheeses and crispy buttery crostini.     Our ham and cheese sandwich was great too.  Nice and grilled with a hearty side of cottage cheese and tomatoes.  We we totally go here again.  It was the perfect way to end our night in Madison.  Great food, service and reasonable prices and we will be back."}
{"text":"Its not really as mind blowing as places I'd typically give 5 stars to, but it really has no noticeable flaws, so I am going 5 here.  Its comfortable, has a good variety of food (catering to everyone from meat eaters to vegans), good service, good beers, board games you can borrow and play, and its a nice break from state street.   The west of Andes or something is a great steak sandwich with avocados, their salad is good... idk, its good.  On trip adviser one review was titled \"chick place\" which I agree with.  Sandwiches or dishes are around $8 - 12"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Madison! Great food, great atmosphere.  For food, I like to alternate between the West of the Andes beef tenderloin sandwich and the Bad Breath Burger - or even better - convince someone to do halfsies with me:) The West of the Andes sandwich is usually a super-tender thick slice of tenderloin topped with absolutely fantastic guacamole. No matter what season this is - it's super good. Overall the menu is a bit small, but what they do have on the menu is fantastic. Also, the dinner special is generally pretty good and they have a nice selection of craft beers on tap.  For the atmosphere, my favorite time of year for Weary Traveler is Winter. There's nothing better than stepping off the cold streets of Willy and into a warm, dimly lit, crowded restaurant/bar for hot Grog and picking out a game to play (in the shelves in the corner.)"}
{"text":"This is a wonderfully intimate and quaint local establishment with great food and drink. The ambiance is great too."}
{"text":"we just moved to madison, and the weary traveler is around the corner from our house. we came here one of our first nights in town, and we've been going back twice or so times a week ever since. if you get there early, it's super casual and laid back, a great place for a beer or two after work. later in the evening, it can get crowded.   the vegetarian food on the menu is fabulous. the tom ka tofu is OUTSTANDING. surprisingly good, vegetarian fare for a bar. love it."}
{"text":"I do like this place. The service is good... and easy on the eyes (for the most part). They have a decent scotch selection, although a bottle of Laphroaig or Caol Ila on the shelf wouldn't hurt. The food has been hit or miss though... mostly miss. I had the chili once and asked them to add beef (which is an option on the menu). Instead, I got the regular ol' vegan chili. I had a tuna sandwich, which was good. The biggest disappointment though is their Bad Breath burger. Given that people have raved about it, I thought I'd give it a try... where to begin. I asked for medium, and it was more like rare. The bun literally crumbled when I picked it up. If you are going to have such a huge hunk of meat and fixins on a bun, make sure the bun is up to snuff the hold the damn thing. I am hoping (for their sake) that this was just a fluke, maybe a nearly stale bun snuck into the establishment an onto my plate. The burger itself wasn't very memorable, except for the bad breath I had after (literally). Finally, the potatoes on the plate were complete undercooked and sorta hard in the middle in that undercooked potato kinda way. I will return to this establishment for drinks, and occasionally the food... but jeez folks - you want a good burger, go to Culvers."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for an after dinner drink.  Super cool, hip atmosphere and they were playing great music, which made things even cooler.  They have board games available to play if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Great space and atmosphere with the exception that it can be a little loud and difficult to hear (on a weekend night).  The food is usually excellent, the \"West of the Andes\" sandwich with tenderloin melts in your mouth!  However, the service can be inconsistent and indifferent."}
{"text":"Rating the Weary after living in Madison for many years, I would give it a 3. For the first five or so years of living in Madison, I would have given it a 5. So it gets a 4.  The Weary's food is consistently decent to good. They focus as much as possible on providing sustainable/locally raised beef and pork. There are usually two daily specials that add to the limited menu. The atmosphere is great; the place is filled with wood and has a classic tin ceiling. The food is pretty good value for what it is.  The biggest problem with the Weary is its limited menu. It has barely changed over the ten years I've lived here, and so now that I've spent time with each dish on the menu, there is nothing I want to eat. Many of the dishes are just okay, not great. The daily specials help add variety. When I am dragged here now, this is what I eat.  Best items: The quinoa salad, with beef. Many people are addicted to the West of the Andes sandwich (I've heard people swear by each of its iterations, the beef, vegetable, and tuna). I love the chicken dish, but can't eat it any more because it violates the sustainable meat provision I've wedded myself to.   Downsides: The salad the dishes come with is meh. The garlicky potatoes that come with many of the dishes are just okay. They are usually greasy and not plentiful. Boy, Woody Allen got that joke right (\"the food is terrible, and what small portions!\"). The Thom Ka has never been right (it is okay, but has WAY too much tofu, the flavor is just slightly off, and you continually have to pick lemongrass out of the soup). The chili is downright terrible; no idea why it has persevered on the menu.   Another large downside: the absolute chaos involved in getting a table when the restaurant is busy. Usually, it is first-come, first-serve, and people will maul your grandmother to get a table. If you are like me, you cannot rest or talk with your companion(s) easily until you've landed a table. Sometimes, one of the owners or bartenders will pretend to be hosts and have a sort of list for seating people. This, uh, sometimes works.   If you are passing through town or new to town, definitely check out this venue. If you hate commotion and want to eat at regular, busy hours, you might want to skip the Weary.  Oh, and the service? It is often great and often terrible. The servers make $$$, but it is hell for them to deal with the crowded space. Expect spotty service. The token dude is generally the worst. I expect nothing when he is assigned to our area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner as we passed though Madison and I absolutely loved this bar. It's got a old, worn in feel to it and it's the type of place you can sit for hours and not realize it. They had a band playing when we were there and the music was great. The food was excellent, I had the burger and my buddy had the walleye. The beer list could probably be better but it's not hard to find something good on it. It's also got a lot of eclectic artwork on the wall, I'm a big fan of that. God I wish I lived down the street from this place!"}
{"text":"All ye faithful Madisonians, gather round for I have a tail to tell:  There is a bar, not too far, a place where all can drink in harmony. The waiters love bad breath, the customers, reckless debauchery.  Carnivores will clammer, their prey will scamper, The vegans and the hunters will peacefully affiliate. So do not fear the coop or the beer, and do not hesitate. (You'll probably have the bad breath burger.)  When as a wee lad, I came to discuss a movie, Y Tu Mama Tambien? the waiter asked me.  And I said yes, yes, yes I'll talk a little and then a lot, it will be loud it will be hot.  But mostly, it'll be spicy. Because I will have the chili."}
{"text":"The Reuben sandwich at the Weary is so unique, if I go too long without one, I crave it. Comes with an incredible potato salad too. I know most people rave about Bob's Bad Breath burger here, but the Reuben is what you should try!  Service can be slow/inattentive, but this is Willy street, what do you expect? It's part of the hippie experience"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Madison. Great food (especially the guacamole and carne asada),  and they make a great Bloody Mary. Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. While it's often crowded and noisy, it really does fit the bill for the type of atmosphere it portrays. (Very Bohemian, cozy bar and restaurant.)  I've never had a bad meal, the bartenders are attentive and fast.   The one complaint I have is that the servers are often overly busy and the service is neglectful from time to time. (If you don't like to wait or dislike large crowds, I'd go here on a week night.)  The late night menu is superb as well. The tofu soup is amazing."}
{"text":"I would USUALLY give this place 4.5 stars. Me and my fellow roommates usually have nothing but good things to say. We went there about a month and a half ago. I wasn't going to write a review but my experience left such a bad taste in my mouth that none of us have been back since. Which is unfortunate because we went there a lot. ( we went there the night before the bad experience)  Heres how the night went: - After just taking our drink orders the waitress had no idea who's drinks went where. Which would not be a big deal if she didn't say \"sorry I've had a longggg day, so I'm like not going to remember anything\" (I'm thinking \"uhhh thanks, I feel so welcome\")  -Never asked us if we needed another drink (when ours were obviously empty)  -Since they don't do separate checks, we initialed and color coded each persons orders, and even wrote the total for each initial at the bottom of the check.  She then picks up the check and says \"you have to figure out tax\" (which in all of the times we have been there we have NEVER had to do before) Even so, If we have to figure out tax why wouldn't it just be included in the price.  Some of my friends I was with didn't even know what percent the tax was. So instead of using a combination of cards and cash we pooled what ever cash we had left exact change.  -we walk out and are almost around the corner when the waitress FOLLOWED US OUT and said we didn't give her a tip and if \"we were going to do that\".  She even had the nerve to ask us \"well do you guys have any cash?\" After 3-4 minute argument, my roommate was so fed up and sick of her following us she just grabbed a bill (which happened to be a $20) and hands it to her.  The waitress then takes it and didn't ask if she wanted change or anything.  (our bill wasn't even $50 so why would we give her such a big tip, especially since we just told her it was terrible service) She just said \"thanks girl you must work in customer service\" and walked off   I told this story at work and had people come up to me when they overheard my story and that they have never heard of anyone following someone out because they didn't like the tip they were given"}
{"text":"A quintessential bar-restaurant-gastropub, featuring good to very good food and some great WI craft ale choices. All delivered by a friendly, helpful staff at reasonable prices. This is the kind of place where you can stop for a drink or two, drop in for dinner, or make a whole evening of it, and in each case walk away happy with your choice.  My one and only complaint, and it does lower the rating, is the fact that tables are close together, and also placed too close to the bar, which can make it a bit uncomfortable when it is crowded as seated and standing patrons and the busy servers have to carom off one another.  I understand they fill every one of those tables and that loss of seats might mean loss of $$$, but even a short wait to get seated was mighty uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Great beer. Great music. Great Food. What else could you want?  I got the \"Bad Breath Burger\". It's made with local organic beef. It's just awesome. I eat a lot of burgers, especially when I see that it's locally raised. This burger however would make my top five of all time.   The staff is great. The bartender had great suggestions to pacify my inner beer-snob. He also had a lot of great local micro-brews which obviously helped him.   The place is nice. There was some nice bluegrassy tunes being played when I came by. I sometimes am indifferent towards music in restaurants. Either it's too loud and I can't converse with friends or it's so boring, quiet, and elevatoresque that I find it annoying. Perfect balance."}
{"text":"I heart the Weary! Every time I go here its always good.  Everything on the menu is sooo great and all the beers on tap are delish.  There is just such an awesome vibe to this place and if you have not experienced it I suggest you get there.  Such a unique awesome place."}
{"text":"Awesome. We came in as literally weary travelers and left beyond stuffed. Appetizer, 2 drinks and main dishes, all under $50."}
{"text":"Best place in town in my opinion. Great prices and fun atmosphere to boot. I take everyone here who visits from out of town.   I strongly recommend my regular meal: Carne Asada with extra guacamole (costs a lil' extra), accompanied by a few pints of Guinness."}
{"text":"The food was tasty -- I had a Reuben sandwich, which was huge. My daughter had a nearly equally huge grilled cheese. My husband had the West of the Andes sandwich, with avocado, pice de gallo, and beef. It was surprisingly not huge. The Ginger Ninja warm cocktail was yummy, but eight bucks. Our service was pretty slow.   I'd give this place another chance. We'll see how it goes next time.   Note that although it l looks like the door is on the corner, it's actually on Few Street. Decidedly NOT handicap accessible as there is a very tall step to get in."}
{"text":"Love the bad breath burger, even if it makes you burp something vicious the rest of the day. Good beers on tap too. Dropped in one day as it dumped snow outside. The bartender had a nice selection of vinyl that he graciously shared atop the record player. Always a nice place to grab a pint and a bite."}
{"text":"The Bad Breath burger and garlic potatoes were soooo good. The place is pleasant - a cozy neighborhood pub."}
{"text":"Weary Traveler is one of the best little east side bars. The food is awesome, especially the bad breath burger. The waitstaff is attentive enough and quite often very attractive. Bonus!  It's a great hangout spot. Board games, good music, good beer selection. The atmosphere is really cool and laid back. I've had many a great evenings at Weary."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the grilled cheese sandwich on the inch thick slices of wheat bread is the best grilled cheese I've ever had.  It was, however, easily in the top five.  Scrumptious, with munch salad.  Not a bad welcome to the Badger State."}
{"text":"I don't journey over to Willy St. as much as I would like, but when I do find myself on that side of Madison the Weary is always my first choice for dinner and drinks with friends.  Back in college I first heard of this place from a coworker who lived in the area.  He told me in no uncertain terms that I needed to come out after work for a few drinks and a late dinner, and I'm happy that I took him up on the offer.  Since then I've made my way back on a semi-regular basis.  The best times at the Weary are when you come in and find a nice larger table right away, especially if you can get one of the corner tables.  The place is almost always crowded, a victim of its own success in a way, and there are no reservations or waiting lists, just first-come first-serve.  As mentioned, there really isn't a good place to wait, and if you end up here crammed in the corner of the bar hoping for a table to open it can be a frustrating experience.  I don't think I've gone on a Friday or Saturday night in some time because of this, instead opting for weekday nights or later in the afternoons.  It's a testament to how good this place is that I find myself working my schedule around their busy times.  The Weary hits all of the right notes: the food is exceptional, the tap selection is top-notch, and the vibe hits the right tone of hip and mellow.  I've made my way through at least half of the relatively short menu, though I've been here more than enough times to try everything at least once over.  I've been prevented from doing so by the extreme excellence of the West of the Andes sandwich - possibly my favorite in all of Madison.  I usually get the tenderloin option (also comes with tuna or veggies), served with avocado, pico de gallo and chipotle mayo.  It's simply the best.  Also great: the Weary's Reuben - probably the best I've ever had, and the Bad Breath burger, which is as great as everyone says.  The goulash is what I tend to go with when I'm looking for a smaller meal, and even then it's filling.  There's a vegan chili as well, which I usually go Not-So and get with beef tips and bacon.  And if you're there with a good sized group of friends you can't go wrong with either the WI cheese & sausage platter or the Mediterranean plate.  I love the Weary Traveler and I've spent many a great night over the last five plus years with friends and family - in fact the Weary is my father's favorite Madison restaurant on account of the goulash.  The place is near perfect, and a consistent option for just about any occasion."}
{"text":"The food is solid, I like the ambiance, the drink selection is good, and the wait staff is friendly. A bar/restaurant done really well.   The only knock i have against the restaurant is that when it's crowded, it gets really loud in there."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler is one of the places in Madison where I most consistently have a great time. Their menu is diverse and amazing. Their seasonal specialty cocktails are always creative and delicious as well. The selection of board games offers plenty to do during a late night drinking session and the decor is borderline indescribable. If I had to boil the decor down to one phrase though, I'd say hipster TGI Fridays, which is in no way an insult and I believe highly accurate. Absolutely a must-try."}
{"text":"I've stopped by this quirky little spot a few times now, for both drinks and grub. It's one of the first restaurants that comes to mind when suggesting yummy eats in the area. I've enjoyed salads, goulash and most importantly BURGERS. Weary Traveler has a diverse menu with many great options. But let's be real, these burgers are where they shine, more specifically, Bob's Bad Breath Burger and boy does the thing live up to its name. Your plate will be equipped with a half-pound burger topped with cream cheese, green goddess dressing, onions, garlic, tomatoes and a mild pepper sauce. Be prepared with a fully stocked napkin holster and a pocket full of mints. This beauty is dripping with gooey, stanky goodness. The mess and the raunchy breath is all so very worth it!"}
{"text":"Wow Wow Wow. Meal great and price superb. Me and my hubby live in Los Angeles CA and we travel a lot and have eaten in some great places. We found this place as we were working in Madison and a local recommended it to us. Am I pleased I went on her recommendation. We both ate the Andes Sandwich. Me the Beef one my fella the tuna one. We will definitely be coming back to eat here again if we ever find ourselves back in the area. We also shared the vegan dessert which I must say was also fab !!!! Service was also great 10 / 10. Cheers!"}
{"text":"We were in the Willy Street area and decided to stop here since it had been on our bucket list since moving to Madison. Can't complain about anything except the service was somewhat slow and the draft beer list was relatively short.   The sun was out so we each ordered a draft beer. The list had a few local and regional options, more bottles than draft. There were two charcuterie plates caught our eye - the meat and cheese plate and the Mediterranean plate. Both were outstanding. All the meat and cheese were local. A huge plus. The Mediterranean plate was like a big Greek salad on a plate with added olives, hummus and tabouli. Yum!! The meat and cheese plate came with crostini that was toasted just right and a side of cherry rhubarb spread that wasn't too sweet and the perfect addition to the plate.  The Mediterranean plate came with pita bread. The waiter said we could have extra of each of the crostini and pita bread if we ran out, but we didn't.   We are excited to come back and try more food options. Supposedly they have a great late night happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Had a Friday night date night here last weekend. I've lived in Madison for 5 years and been wanting to try Weary for a long time now. The couple times I almost ate here, it was super busy and I was too hungry to wait. When we went last Friday, there was only a 5 minute wait. I had a Bourbon Old Fashioned and the Carne Asada. Do yourself a favor. Order this meal! The steak was juicy, tender and flavorful and the guacamole tasted authentic as well. I was skeptical of the pickled carrots, since I'd never had them before, but man, were they good. Acidic and biting in the best way. I cleaned my plate, which is not something I do often!  My date had the grilled cheese with a side of greens and enjoyed every bite as well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food and drinks. Often good specials too, and warm alcoholic drinks in the winter. Personally I find their soup/goulash options are not as good as their other stuff."}
{"text":"We were weary. We were travelling. So naturally this place seemed like a perfect fit.  Wanting real food and not something from a drive through, we took a minor detour on our way home and headed to the Weary Traveler Freehouse. There isn't much signage on the front, so it wouldn't be hard to miss. The place is interesting; eclectic, lots of books and games, a bike suspended from the ceiling, old rotary phones on some of the tables. It has a hippy vibe to it.  We arrived at just the right time, it filled up soon after we were seated. There were several things on the menu that caught our eye; I ended up going with the grilled walleye sandwich and he went the grilled cheese on homemade sourdough. Both sandwiches were really good; I would definitely make a return trip next time we're in Madison."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a friend's recommendation and this place did not disappoint. Great ambience, excellent service, and my burger was fantastic! Not to mention they had a nice beer selection. Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at the weary traveler. I was the best Reuben sandwich I  have ever had. My partner had the burger and said it was great. The atmosphere was amazing also and the price was great."}
{"text":"I'm weary from traveling to an overrated Madison destination.  I had heard of Weary Traveler through Yelp and wanted to go to a cool hangout for my birthday since a few friends were in town.  I don't get to Willy St. very often so I figured it was a good reason to try a fun spot.  I have to say, I was unimpressed.    We were traveling in a group of seven, and we showed up after 8pm on a Saturday.  I fully was expecting a crowded scene and it lived up to expectations.  Unfortunately, two six-person groups had arrived just before us so we were in for an hour wait.  Not the most terrible thing in the world because it was a chance to drink and catch up with each other at the bar.  Good selection of beer and the service was attentive, as long as you don't mind being served by a rude bartender.  Granted, it was busy, but we were quite pleasant to her and she still threw our change back without so much as a 'thank you.'    When we were finally seated at a nice corner circular booth, we did have a good waitress who was very cool.  I ordered Bob's Bad Breath Burger, which was pretty tasty, though while it said 'grass-fed,' it did seem like the patty was the pre-made frozen kind.  I wasn't overly blown away.  My friend's ordered the Carne Asada that looked ok, if you like a few cut pieces of steak over a bed of tortilla chips with some pico de gallo.  Again, didn't really blow my socks off.    As others have mentioned, it's LOUD.  They certainly pack a lot of tables into the two sides of the restaurant and waiters and waitresses are always squeezing behind you at the bar and between the close tables.  The old-school decor, however, is dark, warm and inviting, which I thought was a plus.  Make no mistake:  Weary Traveler is a place to be seen.  The locale on the Willy St. corner is great and there is a reason it is so busy.  The prices seemed reasonable, though I don't think I'll be itching to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: unpretentious hipster pub.  Normally when you hear you're going to a hip pub on Willy Street, you reach for your flannel and thick-rimmed glasses. Not that those would be out-of-place at Weary Traveler, but it's too generic and stereotypical. WT is more than just another place to comb crumbs out of your ironic mustache; it's legitamitely good and unique food and fun.  Come early because there's gonna be a wait. It's tight inside, but doesn't feel cramped. The dark and heavy wood and soft lighting make you feel like your in a friend's cabin. Four of us sat down to play some cards, drink some beers, and grab some grub.  They have a number of old-school games lying around to play while you wait. Their tap beer list is respectable, with pitchers running $12-$14. We split a Wisconsin Meat and Cheese Platter (Medium - $13.50 was enough for four) which featured turkey, ham, and sausage with a few different cheeses and crostinis. The crostinis were a bit stale, but the local meats were delicious. The (duck?) liver pate was a bit much for me.  My main course was the West of the Andes Sandwich ($8.75). Jeebus, that was good. Avocado, pico de gallo, and chipotle mayo atop perfectly grilled beef tenderloin. More than enough food for the price, and the quality was outstanding. Greasy enough to need napkins, but not so much to overpower the other tastes. Arguably one of the best sammiches in Madison. I subbed a special side of rice that night, but the usual mixed greens looked like a sad little addition.  Overall I had a wonderful experience at Weary Traveler. If you're in the area, definitely give it a try. There's few better places to spend some time with friends in the area."}
{"text":"That's it, I have eaten at the Weary Traveler at least one time too many, and I am never coming (or getting dragged) back.  I really, truly, do not understand what is supposed to be so great about this place.  It is crowded, loud, dark, dusty, and in my opinion, the last place I'd want to go with anyone, if only because I can't see or hear them.  The menu is pretty limited, and I think I always end up with the carne asada just because nothing else sounds remotely appealing.  The last time I had that dish, it was shockingly spicy -- others at the table had ordered it as well, and claimed that theirs was not, so I'm not sure if something got spilled on my plate or what, but it was pretty rough going to actually eat any of it.  In fact, my vague recollections of other meals here include everything being way over-spiced...  I picked at the small amount of meat, ignored the giant pile of tortilla chips, and wondered how it was, with all the restaurants in Madison, that I'd ended up there.  Despite my full-ish plate when she cleared, the server didn't inquire if I needed a box or if anything was wrong.  The last straw for me was some, uh, digestive difficulties we'll call it, post-meal and the following day.  I can't say for sure it was the carne asada, but I don't know what else it might have been.  So I don't care how \"cool\" people think this place is -- I'd give it pass."}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me I had to eat here when I was in Madison because the food was \"really amazing\". Turns out the food was terrible. No flavor. Bad service. Horrible decor. I mean there's a metal rod with a speaker on top right in the center of the dining room. It was the worst food related experience I've had in a long time. Maybe it was a bad night or the normal chef was sick or something. No idea. This place sucks though. I was really surprised at how many people were there eating. Blah blah blah.."}
{"text":"Ended up here after we tried three other places with crazy long waits, despite it being after 8 pm. It ended up being a fortuitous bit of luck.   It's so cozy. Yes, you're sitting a bit close to fellow diners, but the lighting is warm, the vibe is \"friends kitchen\" and the food is really good.   I had the burger and even though I'm not much of a burger person, I was impressed and would go back for more. There's a slab of cream cheese on it and it was a bit too much for me, but when I took some of it off and spread it around, it was much better.   We were so happy to have stumbled upon this place and we'll definitely be back. A great way to end a day in Madison."}
{"text":"Bad Breath Burger Carne Asada  Could not stop saying \"mmmmmmmmm\" the entire meal.  Good atmosphere, good service.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"My most recent brunch experiences here at the Weary have made me up my star rating. Why is that?  Reason #1: Le Toast. OMG. This is what all French toast should be like. Thick (like over an inch) slices of homemade whole grain bread in this perfect cinnamon-y, almond-y, sweet-but-not-too-sweet batter...and with real maple syrup on the side. YUM. **Tip: Get a half order with a side of...  Reason #2: The bacon. The slices of bacon are also huge(\"double-thick cut\" is no joke), and have been nice and crispy when I've gotten them.   Reason #3: The service. I gave the Weary 3 stars in the past for slow service, and I think if you hit it at a super-busy time, this can still be the case. However, the last couple of times I've gone the servers have been ultra friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Had this Bob's bad breath burger that everyone is raving about and it is a MUST order!!! It was the best burger I've ever had and the potatoes that come on the side.....,dang they're doing something right! All if the food comes from local sources and they are every proud of it. It had a cool atmosphere. Without a doubt will be back here again!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with a couple girlfriends. It is a cute little place on Willy Street and I was excited to give it a try.  The interior is very homey and features a lot of weird pictures and eclectic decorations. They have a bunch of board games and giant chess pieces up on a shelf. It is a fun place!  On the downside - it was freezing in there! They were very clearly making an effort to minimize this by having the main entrance be the back entrance so people coming in to the restaurant don't open the door and let the air in, but it was still pretty chilly.   The food was alright, and the service was a little slow, but no real complaints. I had a good time meeting up with my friends. :)"}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese in Madison! Get it loaded with avacado and onion!! Love this place. Stopped here for the late risers brunch. The boyfriend got eggs and potatoes. He said the flavor was good but they were a little more oily than normal...still a favorite! Restaurant is a gem!!"}
{"text":"We trekked out early for a Friday to make sure we didn't have to wait for a table. 6:15pm arrival - snagged the last table in the place. After that, there was a steady crowd hovering around the door, waiting for tables to turn over.    I really liked the energy of the place, bustling and warm with wood floors and tin ceilings.  We ordered a pitcher of Hopalicious ($14) which seemed to be less quantity-wise than four pints (about $4/ea), so you'd probably break about even to simply order the beer you want by the glass vs get a pitcher, just sayin'. The dinner menu was reasonably priced with many items in the $9-10 range and several veg options.  I opted for the stuffed butternut squash and the Mister got the dinner steak special.    45 minutes later... dinner came (wowzers, good thing I wasn't too hungry)!  Indeed, tables seated after us were somehow served dinner before us, but regardless, we were excited when our food finally arrived. The butternut squash was presented nicely, with a side salad and  topped with sliced avocado.  However, it was a bit dry and lacked much flavor besides regular ol' squashiness.  The steak  was undersized and over-cooked... yikes, a double whammy!  Even the veg at the table knew that sucker was nowhere close to being medium rare.  Fortunately our waitress was accommodating about sending it back and replacing it.     All in all, ambiance was great, prices were good, service was fine, food was underwhelming.  I'd be willing to give it another shot, but there are probably a number of other spots I'd plan on hitting up first..."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Went on a Tuesday evening with 2 others and sat right away. We were a little bit confused as we walked in if we were supposed to seat ourselves or if there was a host somewhere. We ended up having to walk up to the bar and ask.. so I'm not sure what the protocol is. Anyway onto the food:  Bob's bad breath burger is so good! I would say the meat was a little bit too much for me (half-pounder) but I guess others would be happy. There is cream-cheese on it, which others may feel weird about, but I loved it! Side salad was perfect and  side potatoes were AMAZING. My friends asked me why I'm eating all of my sides first, which I dont usually do. Cup of chili that my friend got looked good. Big chunks of tomato and beef.   It's really dark inside so it's hard to see the details of some foods like chili.. but it didn't bother me with my burger. I would def come back for some dinner, beer, or weekend brunch. They also have board games, which I didn't play but would def come back for! It's pretty small, so I wouldn't be surprised if there was a wait to sit."}
{"text":"Ok four friends are looking at the area for lunch and throwing out suggestions, pizza pies, Mexican, grills and my one buddy ended you saying that this place has good burgers so away we went because I have only had drinks here and the food looked good.  Ok the brunch menu was in service and two of us are scratching our heads looking for good burgers on the menu, there is only one period which is the Bobs bad breath burger which neither of us wanted, we were looking for a list of burger options to choose from. My buddy is feverishly trying to talk us in to just getting it anyway which turns into cranky/spirited lecture of how I should have it how the chef makes it, FU#k no that's not what and I'm not getting it. I ask the server if I could get a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato and raw onion rare which she says is ok so that's what I got. My buddy try's to embarrass me by telling our server that I'm being difficult and the whole kitchen should spit in my burger, nice guy.  The burger came in a reasonable amount of time for how busy the place was and did it spectacular on the plate. It came with a side of greens and basically house made thick chips. During the lecture he says how he also hates how people salt their food before tasting it so I made it a point to pull the top bun off and salt the burger in front of him, former restaurant owners can be bitchy when dining with them.  The burger was so Fu#%ing good with the rare 1/2 patty having garlic in it and a nice grill flavor that just complemented the fresh lettuce, thick sliced tomatoes, raw red onion, crispy bacon and meaty cheese on a very fresh light bun. The garlic and grill flavor of the meat combined really set this burger apart from other burgers. The greens were good with a surprising heat finish that has a delay when eating them. I don't care at all for chips with any sandwich from a restaurant no matter how good they are, please give us frys because chips always appears as cheaping out on the plate.  This place is definitely worth stopping over for a burger even if it means a special request because of allergies or what ever and it's a cool place also."}
{"text":"First time visitor to the Weary Traveler. It's in a more hippie-ish liberal part of town (wait, what part of Madison is NOT liberal...nevermind). We were seated at a table too tightly positioned between two other tables, and the table wasn't level, so it rocked when you leaned on it. *pet peeve*.  The menu is not super extensive, but features a variety of food. You're likely to find something to try, but you may go more outside your comfort zone to get there if you are looking for standard bland American fare. I ordered the walleye sandwich. The sliced/fried red potatoes on the side were delicious. The walleye portion of the sandwich was great, but the bread/bun really overwhelmed the sandwich.  Service was adequate, but I felt as if they were rushing to get us to pay our bill and get out. I'm not sure I need to visit this restaurant again, but it was not horrible either. Parking in the area is pretty limited, though it has a very tiny lot behind the building."}
{"text":"okay. i know i \"should\" love this place and think i am in the minority here but - c'mon. every time i am at this place i feel like they (the staff) think they are doing  me a favor by letting me in.   had dinner w/ 3 others in late january and knew we were in for trouble from the start. first the \"wrong server\" came to our table, took our drinks order and disappeared. then the \"right server\" came to our table and said that the other person was mistaken. still no drinks. then the \"wrong server\" came back and apologized for the confusion. still no drinks. sooner or later, our drinks arrived and then we placed our dinner order. at the suggestion of the \"right server\" i got the pork chop special. a reasonable amount of time later, my table-mates dinners are served and i am informed it will be \"just a few more minutes\" for mine. my polite table-mates cannot be persuaded to start eating. . . 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes pass... at nearly the 25 minute mark, my food shows up, without apology, explanation, or accommodation.   c'mon.   i agree the food can be good, the atmosphere is fun, and the location is great but the service swings between disinterested and pretentious.   same goes for  nat spill (owned by the same person/family, if i'm not mistaken). i've got better ways and places to spend my money."}
{"text":"Tonight is cheap food review night.  This is the best bang for buck in town. you gotta come down to Willy street if you haven't tried!!!  This is a gastropub, more casual, more hipster than Graze, Forequarter or Merchant, BUT cheaper, and just as good!!!  And, its the one of the few late night places on Willy street!  What's good? Bob's bad breath is the best!!! I also love the chicken dijonnaise, its so tender and juicy... Don't forget to get EXTRA garlic potatoes! Tom Ka tofu; Not so vegan chilli and hungarian goulash are also really good for the winter weather!  I'm alright with cocktails there.  You can also play their board games!!! so awesome for a board games geek like me!  Lastly, they are crowded, weekdays or weekends; just come prepared. If you get a seat, food comes relatively quicklY!"}
{"text":"Ok food, super busy, no place to wait.   Service was good....everything else was mediocre"}
{"text":"Whenever I am back in town this place is a must! Everything on the menu is fantastic and the ambiance is cozy and terrific. Mom always gets the Catfish, a tasty nonalcoholic drink and faves about it. The burger is amazing, this is always what I recommend to carnivores, and I love the West Andes Snack plate. It is deliciously spicy!!! Thank goodness this place opened up in Madison, it gives me one more reason to visit."}
{"text":"If it is possible, and you desire,  to become hip and artistic by being near those who are then you should head over to the Weary Traveler. The food is great and the beer selection good. Really this place is the whole package."}
{"text":"The weary traveler can be loud when it's really crowded, but the food is so good.  My favorite is the bad breath burger.  The burger by itself is good, but then it's full of garlic and onions too.  I love this place."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler is a great neighborhood spot and the perfect place to bring anyone new to Madison. The food is unique and tasty, the ambiance is relaxed and comfortable, and the game wall is a nice touch. Friday and Saturday evenings are always busy, so aim for a week night or a late night dinner. Service is always friendly, but sometimes slow."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler Freehouse has really good food and drink.    I was in Madison over the weekend and stopped in this place for a burger and a beer.  I had the Bob's Bad Breath Burger and it was really really good.  The beer was super cold and the staff was more then friendly.    There was a ton of old hippies in this place, but the more I time in Madison, the more I came to realize, that number of old hippies had nothing to do with The Weary Traveler.  They old hippies may have bad taste in music, razors, soap, clothes, and footwear, but apparently they have great taste in food and spirits.   Check out the Weary Traveler."}
{"text":"Two words: Tuna Steak.  I'll drive across town for that.  Energetic atmosphere, usually busy and loud, but a nice crowd and good food."}
{"text":"The hippiest, hippest, & hipsterish locale bound to bring about not just weary travelers, but travellers from near, far, & beyond.  Ah... Near, Far, & Beyond brings back memories of a great friend, Paul, who was a vast landowner in one of the states in our great country. I'd often hear him joke about a store called Bed, Bath & Beyond, & make them about Bed & Breakfast type accommodation. He'd smirk, & I could perfectly recall his face, despite interacting with him on the phone, as he'd say, \"that place that's called,\" Bed & Breakfast & Beyond\". You get the general idea ;)  Similarly, The Weary Traveler Freehouse embodies a personal style all of its own influenced by Madison as one of the most free, hippest, & hippiest cities anywhere. A close competitor is Portfuckingland, Oregon, & Williamsburg, & Greenpoint in Brookfuckinglyn. That's in NYC for all of you outside the Milky Way, & the Andromeda galaxy. Atleast, that's where anyone from NYC thinks they're from when you meet New Yorkers internationally.   Non-New Yorker/non-American: \"Where are you from?\"   New Yorker: \"Brooklyn\"   (oh yes, Brooklyn is indeed the center of the Universe for hipsters, unless you're hailing from Portland, Oregon or Madison, Wisconsin).  Let's take a look at why The Weary Traveler Freehouse is a good example of all that is free, hippie, hip, & hipster:  You can only walk in from the side door (brings you to the establishment, & the restrooms galore). With philosophical, spiritual, footloose & fancy free posters, writing, travel photography, & eclectic messages all over from ceiling to floor. Yes, this is all inside on the walls within the restrooms. Walking towards another swinging door, & all in archaic print is further philosophical, religious, spiritual writing. I can't attest what it is, because I've never, infact, gotten a chance to read that vast writing. Usually as we set forth to the commencent of our evening here at Weary Traveler Freehouse, I am usually off to being present with company giving me little to no time to peruse the wall.   As you enter into another door within the Freehouse, you are bewitched by more antique posters, vintage decorations, photographs from the world, & plants.   This is just all the viewing, & wall \"eye candy\". I've yet to tell you anything about the restaurant or the service or the food.   FOOD Everything I've ever eaten has been nothing short of delicious. Everything on the menu is usually organic, local, & sustainably produced whether local or from sustainable parts of the USA. It's all rather simply cooked, baked, laden, & put on plates set forth. From your classic baked chicken to your Korean cold noodles to ice-cream pints from Calliope ice-cream. Some of the creamiest ice-cream in our country, but it's only available here as far as I know, & by contacting them.   That fantastically, & correctly baked chicken is good enough to make the chicken grease dripping down your chin a pure simple chicken luxury. From their grilled cheese loaded with avocado & onion to their West of the Andes Sandwich, it'll turn you into the best Mariachis singing aguacateeeee!!   Plus, you can add their wild Alaskan salmon for just a few extras to all their salads. The prices are for the kind of weary traveler who once traveled from Helsinki to Beijing by train via the Trans-Siberian, & Trans-Mongolian Railroads...Seeing majestic palaces, & museums of St. Petersburg, & Moscow, gazing into the endless expanse of Siberian grasslands, & forests, riding Bactrian camels up stunning Gobi sand dunes for a taste of the nomadic lifestyle, & strolling the ancient streets. I always feel at home back at the Weary Traveler even when I'm not traveling. After eating at the Weary Traveler, you too can be just like me, & take that trip. :)   Furthermore, they've got board games, & the beer is always tasty with an eclectic choice for all my late rising readers. Speaking of which, they've even got a brunch menu with a special list of choices called the Late Risers Brunch.   SERVICE  Very hippie meets hipster. Kind, relaxed, & maybe even border line sprezzatura. ;)   As fittingly as it's said for a place like The Weary Traveler, the message in small print on their website says: \"BRIGHT PEOPLE ALWAYS READ THE FINE PRINT. CHOICE IS GOOD... AND YOU CHOSE AN INDEPENDENT RESTAURANT. - YOU ROCK.\"  9/2018"}
{"text":"Weary Traveler is one of my local favorites,  a pretty distinctive expression of Madison's  Willie Street  sensibility that serves  interesting and distinctive dishes in a friendly and comfortable neighborhood atmosphere. Their interpretations of a reuben sandwich and burger (their justly celebrated \"Bob's bad breath\" burger) keep me coming back for lunch, and their carne asada makes a nice meal as well. I'm trying to make my way through some of their other dishes, each of which has its own creative elements. Much of what they do is locally sourced, with good veggie options. There are good non-alcoholic drink options, including their \"catfish\", a kind of fresh, tart lime-ade that i find especially refreshing, and a good iced tea and Sprecher root beers as well. I'm something of a regular, and I find service both competent and very friendly and welcoming. No waitrons here--the servers have real human personalities. Food can take a bit longer to come out than I would sometimes prefer, and their excellent potato side dish sometimes comes out lukewarm rather than hot. Their salad greens can be a bit bitter for my taste. But these are minor imperfections in a generally great place."}
{"text":"I love this place for the atmosphere and the delicious food.  I especially love The Weary Traveler for teaching me that vegetarian chili really can be as amazing as chili with meat.  If you're just in the mood for an intimate spot to get a drink with some friends, this is a central location  with good drinks and a great set up to get a group together.  The last time I went, they only took cash - - - just something to keep in mind!"}
{"text":"It's very possible that if I were to move away from Madison (having lived here now for nearly 15 years) that upon a return visit, the Weary Traveler would be my first stop. This restaurant never disappoints. Their Old Fashioneds are some of the best in town.    Two of my favorite items on the menu include the Goulash and the West of the Andes Sandwich. Friends of mine swear by the Bad Breath Burger. The menu is on the smaller side but I've never gotten something I didn't like.   And save room for Key Lime Pie. One can almost guarantee when I go out for dinner I won't get dessert. The Weary Traveler is my exception to that rule."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, usually busy, might have to wait for a table but good food and cozy environment."}
{"text":"The only thing to do in Madison is drink!  I loved this place as they had Hot Buttered Rum.  Always wanted to try that since reading Harry Potter.  I also had the Grog and let me tell you, the Grog is responsible for the third star.  My meal was good and tasty for bar food.  All bars are raising the bar on their food and this one is no different.  Really great and the service was amazing.  They do not separate bills which is so odd.  I will not go here again just for that reason.  It boggles the mind that a place with EPIC 10 mies away will not cater to groups.  NO wonder it is not crowded when we go.  This cannot be bourne for employees on work related trips.  We have to separate checks for our travel claims.  But all in all a great time."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally make the trek to Willy to try the Weary Traveler. I've been itching to eat here for a while and Friday I was finally able to do so. We got there around 7 and the place was packed. We put our name in with the host (a little hard to find him by the way) and waited for about a half hour for our table. One complaint is that there isn't much room to wait. Yes, you can sit at the bar but otherwise you're stuck behind the curtain by the door that people are walking in and out of. I realize this is probably something that is unavoidable since the space isn't that big to begin with. It's just the one thing I didn't enjoy too much.  Once we were seated I decided to try the Wisconsin Cherry Seltzer. It was super refreshing and not too sweet. I really enjoyed it. One of my friends decided to order a cup of the Tom Ka Tofu soup which was AMAZING. I will return here just to order bowls and bowls of this soup! Not too sweet with just the right amount of heat. It was so yummy. For my meal I ordered the Med plate. I wasn't super hungry and hummus sounded good. It was plenty of food for me and came with a pretty large salad, some hummus and tabbouleh and homemade pita bread. The salad was yummy as was the hummus and tabbouleh. I wish they gave you more pita bread however - 5(ish) slices was just not enough to eat up all of the yummy things on that plate!   My friend and I decided to order a slice of the Tres Leches cake to finish off our meal. I am so glad we did, it was delicious. The cake was sweet and not soggy at all, and the whipped cream was very clearly homemade. It was a wonderful way to end the meal.   The price is right, the food is good, and the space is super cool. It took me too long to get here the first time and I can guarantee it won't take me as long to come back."}
{"text":"Bad. Breath. Burger.  Had to try the infamous Bob's Bad Breath Burger, and it lives up to it's name. Set in somewhat of a hole-in-the-wall place (somewhat easy to miss if you're not looking for it). I'd heard so much about this burger that I finally had to go. Talk about your garlic and onion overload. ALMOST too much garlic, especially on the chips (some felt soggy, as if they had been soaking in garlic.) Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say. Good wine, great food. I had the WILD caught salmon, always good, with wild rice , chard, zucchini and tomatoes...DELISH!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Madison for over three years, I thought it was about time I checked out  the Weary Traveler. My husband and I live on the near west side and felt a little out of place on Willy St. but still find it a fun, eclectic place to be from time to time. When we walked in, the bartender immediately noticed that we may be looking for a table even though the place was pretty packed! He promised us a place to sit within ten minutes, then cheerfully served us up a beer while we waited. As we sipped our beers, we admired the fun decor and people-watched.   We were led to our cozy corner hi-top table within the promised time and our server was wonderful. He offered suggestions when asked, and seemed like he really enjoyed his job. I had it narrowed down to the reuben or the Bad Breath Burger, and ended up going with the burger. OMG. It was, hands down, the best burger I've ever had in my life!! My husband had the dijonaise chicken and he loved it too. He said \"I wish I could have this sauce on everything!\"  On top of the great food and service, the prices were extremely reasonable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Solid gastro pub with decent local and regional brews. Salad and bad breath burger stand out. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"Bob's badbreath buger with the garlic potatoes are out of this world!! Also check out their NessAlla Kombucha cocktails made in house... wow."}
{"text":"Bloody chicken! I am not talking about a minor little colorful juice or a bloody tinge or colored bone I mean a full on artery's worth of blood running out of my chicken. I tell the waitress and she gives me a crazy attitude and this BS about it being totally normal and that I am just doing it wrong. She said their chickens are all natural and that because they break it down themselves this happens. Well given the fact that the size of the thigh and leg were such that they obviously got a VERY young chicken it would obviously have more blood coming from the bone, but that is definitely not a sign of quality. Also breaking it down yourself or it being \"all natural\" doesn't mean anything. If anything extra blood is a sign you didn't defrost it fully before you cooked it. I had her throw it on the grill to cook it some more and when I got it it tasted fine despite her constant statements that it would be much too dry to enjoy. Sorry I don't need to be told what is quality or delicious don't tell me I am tasting it wrong or I don't know what I like. Do they honestly think I have never eaten a chicken from a farm, broken one down myself and baked it? I mean seriously it's chicken who hasn't eaten it?"}
{"text":"I wandered into the Weary Traveler and saddled up to the bar both weary and hungry, having braved the frigid cold walk from my apartment.  The friendly wait staff served me up with a \"West of the Andes\" sandwich (w/ steak) and a tasty beer from one of their taps.  The sandwich was just the right size, scrumptious, and decently priced.  Service was quick around 5:30pm on a Saturday, but I have a feeling it gets quite busy later in the evening.  Looks to be a fun place to hang out with a group."}
{"text":"Visited for dinner on a Sunday. Originally we had planned to visit another restaurant in the area but they ended up being closed despite their hours saying otherwise. We were not disappointed with the change though!  We arrived on the early side of dinner and chose a table near the front. They had ample seating for larger groups, the table we chose could have seated six, so conversation was a bit tough for our group of four. No one to blame but ourselves for that though! Our server was very nice, but because it was early she was not super familiar with the specials yet. They had three specials and two of our group went with one of them, beef tacos. They were really good, but unfortunately we had been quoted the wrong price for them. Still worth the price, but it wasn't as good of a value as it initially seemed.   I had the Reuben which was gigantic. I ended up eating only half and having the rest for a very delicious breakfast the next day. First time I've had a wet sandwich like that hold up overnight! A friend and I also split the superfood salad as a suggestion from our server and it turned out to be a great option.   I'm definitely looking forward to returning for brunch, and would certainly do dinner again."}
{"text":"I had the Bad Breath Burger and it was delicious.  There were bits of garlic in the patty and the cream cheese combined with the greasiness of the patty made the burger ooze with goodness.  I did not put it down.  The potatoes that came with it also had garlic with it and they were delicious as well.  Yum.  Split a small Meat and Cheese Platter, but this was nothing to rave about.  Sub par deli meats and cheese slices, not even cubed.  The service was acceptable, though the tables were small and the place loud."}
{"text":"Dining here felt really great! Its a chill atmosphere - dim lighting, good music, plenty of eclectic knickknacks decorating the walls (Think of Applebees or Crackerbarrel)  We got and split an order of Carne Asada and a Cup of Hungarian Goulash, 2-ways.  Carne Asada ($13) - Daaaaaang. So this is pretty much a gourmet nacho plate. You've got a pile of chips with a sliced-up 6-ish ounce flank steak sitting atop. On the side of the plate you've got a very generous pile of guacamole, about a half cup ofpico de gallo, and about a half cup of pickled fennel and carrot slices. I'm going to ask that they cook the steak to \"medium\", rather than the standard \"medium rare\" next time I order, but it was DELICIOUS and there definitely WILL be a next time.  Hungarian Goulash ($6) - First, the \"cup\" was pretty big and satisfying! I'd say we got about 16 oz. of \"not-quite-stew-but-still-pretty-packed-with-veggies-and-meat\" soup. I'm sure that a \"bowl\" would satisfy almost anyone as a meal. TWT didn't skimp. The beef was exceptionally tender and the seasoning/spice game was on point.  Above average experience. Four stars. Thanks, TWT. :)"}
{"text":"Local neighborhood tavern with good bar food... Part of a chain owned  with a successful formula ...  fun place to go and eat a burger-- but NOT a great place to go sit and enjoy a nice meal and conversation.    hipsters hangouts in lots of costumes ."}
{"text":"Our Vegan friends brought us here because of the menu options for themselves. Nothing special here I had the Bob's Bad Breath Burger and my wife had their Ruben, it wasent bad it was just ok, ill never return again while in Madison!"}
{"text":"An eclectic and well thought out menu which has rock solid staple items and fun seasonals too!"}
{"text":"Love the look of this place, you walk in and it's like you time traveled back to the early 1900's.  Dimly lit, with candles in mason jars at every table, gorgeous chandeliers hanging from the ceiling along the bar, a shade of maroon painted on the tin ceiling, and books upon books everywhere.   Our wait was about an hour, but we got there right at the dinner rush. It's a bit crowded as the place was beyond busy and nowhere to really stand while waiting for your table. But the awesome service and outstanding food makes up for it.  Our waiter was absolutely the sweetest guy ever. He made our dining experience wonderful. Our table was a bit wobbly but not terrible to where we would have to mention it to him, but he noticed it and instantly fixed it by placing something under it. I ended up getting the Weary Traveler Ruben, which was fantastic. It came with Potato salad and Kale salad. The sandwich was so big I couldn't even eat one half as much as I wanted to.  What made the whole experience was.our server, and the host. I believe that the host was actually the owner. He was so sweet, and really liked our group as he talked to us for about 10 minutes when we first put our name in. Then, when he sat us down to our table, he talked to us even more, explained a new menu item that he made up in honor of his father, and that we were sitting next to his skis that decorated the wall!    Awesome place, can't wait to check it out again!"}
{"text":"The food's great here. But bike, walk or come on the bus, there is little or no parking around the restaurant. When they get busy, expect slow service."}
{"text":"The Weary is a solid joint on the underrated east side of Madison. Is this a place where extremely liberal folks hang out for good food and drinks? Yes. Thus, if you are not willing to overhear some \"hippies\" as my brother would call the folks that typically hang out here, then please stay closer to the capital.   I'll be honest - I've only had the Andes sandwich, but that is because this steak sandwich literally melts in your mouth. Everything from the bun to the steak is simply delicious. I personally love avocado and it's always fresh and full of flavor.  Are there other good choices on the smaller menu? I'd be willing to bet on it.   In addition, there is a great selection of beer. I've also been here with my parents on a Sunday afternoon and there was live music. I'm pretty sure my dad was taken back to his college \"hippie\" days. Undeniably sweet."}
{"text":"I've been the the Weary on a few occasions and it's generally has not been terribly good or bad. However, on my last visit, things were oh, sooo not good. In general, the drinks are ok, nothing special. I feel like it tries too hard to be unique, but the taste is ok, so I can get over it. The menu items all look pretty good and to be fair, what I ordered last time did taste very good, if it had been done correctly.  I was there with a fairly large group of people and out of our table, the server completely forgot my drink and after she dropped the drinks off, she disappeared for about 20 minutes before we could flag her down to get her to realize she forgot my drink. Then it took another 10 to actually get it. So, first round of drink took a total of about 40 minutes for me to get. Then on to the food. I ordered the Chicken Dijonnaise, with the thigh and leg. I was told it would take extra time because they cook it fresh with every order, which I was completely fine with. When I get my food and I cut into the thigh, IT STARTED BLEEDING!!! Not just a small drip of blood like I had cut into a vein, I get that poultry some times bleeds just a tiny amount even when cooked correctly. No, it was like seriously bleeding and the texture of the meat just looked undercooked.   We flag down our server and show her my bleeding chicken and I kept on waiting for the mortification and at least ONE apology. That never happened! Her answer was \"our chickens are really fresh and we butcher them ourselves everyday, so that's why it's bleeding\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? (My mom is a chef and I'm from a country where it's perfectly normal for you to go to the open market and come home with a chicken and kill it yourself, so don't talk to me about fresh chickens!!!) So she reluctantly sent the food back.  She comes back later with my food, which by the way, they just further cooked the previous pieces of bleeding chicken instead of preparing another order for me and put it BACK ON THE SAME PLATE that it had bled on and served it back to me. You know, with the same mashed potatoes that have now absorbed all the blood that was on the plate. And the server goes \"ok, so they cooked it a little more for you\" in an almost condescending manner, like I was being a nuissance because I didn't want to die of food poisoning. Then she goes \"so it was just a bit underdone, but I just have to educate you about our chicken. It is really fresh, we get them shipped everyday from the farm, so that's why it was bleeding.\"  WHAT?????? Ok, I ordered CHICKEN, not steak or duck or lamb or even pork I can let it go a bit underdone. Clearly this woman has absolutely no business working in the food industry if she thinks it's ok to have chicken slightly underdone. And I'm sorry, but I am not a six year old that needs to be \"educated\". I have never had this low level of service in my life. It took everything in my body to not yell at her and ruin the evening for everyone in my group, since it was a going away party.   And at the end of the evening, I still got the full bill. Not even a single drink taken off for almost giving me food poisoning! And not a single apology for making me wait for my drink, wait for my food, undercooking my food. Needless to say, I will not be back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Great little place. Good beer selection and a menu full of gluten free and began options but great things for the rest of us too. A little dark but that all blends in with decor. Good mid range price point but deliver higher end experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. The neighborhood is fantastic and the menu is eclectic with something for everyone. If you are visiting Madison and want a quality meal a little away from downtown, this is a great choice. The Bobs Bad Breath Burger is a must have but I've tried several items and always been impressed."}
{"text":"Weary is an awesome spot for many occasions. Let it be brunch, late night, drinks, or just to play boardgames in a cozy dimly lit room.   They have items from various cuisines: American style burgers/sandwiches, Mediterranean plate, Hungarian goulash and so on... Interesting choices all round.  The atmosphere and crowds here are quite pleasing as well. It's definitely a spot to check out on Willy!"}
{"text":"Warm interior with lots of wood paneling. Bar runs the entire width of interior. Didn't stay for food but good selection of wisco beers I hadn't seen elsewhere. Friends have said the food is tasty. Great last stop spot on the night"}
{"text":"Wow. Been here any number of times almost always good food/service.  This time not to much.  Waited for half hour for table, which was OK.  Ordered food and watched as many other tables got their order before us.  Finally gave up after 75 minutes.  As we were leaving the food finally came.  Unfortunately, of the 4 meals, 2 were cold.  I will try again, but  I would advise giving it a few weeks to figure out how yo run a restaurant again."}
{"text":"Left my credit card there by accident and my waiter RAN after us for a block or two to return it! Amazing service. Thanks Travis (I think)! Wonderful food too."}
{"text":"Love this place for the decor and fun vibes. The board games are perfect to go with casual dinner and beer. Service was good, friendly and accommodating. Salmon was overcooked, but I got thumbs up from the goulash and burger. The ketchup and garlic potatoes stole the show. Would come back definitely."}
{"text":"I only wanted to post a review to drastically refute another review.  The Weary is NOTHING like Applebee's or Cracker Barrel.  Good food.  Decent service.  Hipsters galore.  The decor is books, poems and art.  Not Applebee's"}
{"text":"I have never been to The Weary Traveler but have always wanted to go as I have heard so many good things about it! So when my good friends from out of town suggested it for Sunday brunch, I was so excited!  Our reasoning for choosing: They open at 11:30 and still serve brunch. Great for late risers like us who want to avoid a 1.5 hr wait at other brunch locations. HOWEVER. Not sure it was worth it.  There were 4 of us who arrived as they opened. Ordered bloodies (delicious, but seemed weak) and waited for the latecomer in our party (me). When I arrived 20 min later. They had ordered an appetizer and seemed to have just gotten their drinks. 5 min later the server approached me casually and I ordered a bloody and a water. We also placed our orders. 15 min later I still hadn't received my bloody. I watched a few other tables who had arrived after us get their drinks. 25 min in, I had to go ask the bartender about my drink, turns out it was never ordered.  Note: my friends still hadn't received their CHEESE PLATE. Ordered before I had even got there.  45 min in, the cheese plate and friend's meal (ordered at the same time) arrived. Great blue cheese... But the other cheeses looked and tasted like they were something you could find in a ziplock at the grocery store.   I'm rambling. Moral of the story we ordered at 12:05pm on a Sunday. We received our food at 1:20pm with to-go boxes so my fellow diners could catch their rides back to their respective cities.  There was very little communication or explanation from our server about what was going on with our food, which felt like we spent most of the brunch wondering where our food was vs. enjoying our short time together. The server seemed very aloof and unaware of how hangry/ ridiculous it was to wait over an hour for eggs.   FINALLY. I received my 2 eggs over medium with toast, potatoes, and bacon.. Hoping it would be mind-blowing/ amazing. The eggs: overcooked and lukewarm. The toast: cold and without the preserves the menu stated they came with. The potatoes: a mixture of crispy and underdone with garlicky cheese.  I asked the server for the preserves, she gave me the options, I chose cherry. I was given pear. Mind blown.  They were not busy. I work at a brunch restaurant in Madison and I know busy. We watched many other tables receive their meals before us. They were not full. About half of the tables were unoccupied.  I am just so confused as to what happened here. It will take A LOT of bribing to get any of us back here. :/"}
{"text":"The food was amazing here. I was a little annoyed because my husband got the same thing as I did, but we were both SOOO happy with our order that it was okay. We got the West of the Andes Sandwich with the beef tenderloin, and the sandwich was delicious. The meat was perfectly seasoned, and even though I can't handle most spicy things. This had just the right level for me. Eventhough the salad that came with it was too spicy for me to finish the sandwich and potatoes were so good that I didn't mind at all.   The space itself is a little cramped, but it's also really cool looking. The bar set up has this amazing chandelier, and there are books and board games. It just had a very comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ambiance, Ambiance, Ambiance. Great vibe! The food was really well done. Meat and cheese tray was delicious. Bob's Bad Breath Burger was as good a burger as I have had in Madison. Great craft beer selections and mixed drinks. Service was decent but not great.  Worth the trip.  The worst?  Parking!!!!! :("}
{"text":"Went here to grab a quick dinner with a friend on a Wednesday night. We were seated and taken care of promptly. There were a decent amount of people both at the bar and dinner tables. For dinner I ordered the West of the Andes sandwich. It was basically everything I like put on a sandwich. It had a creamy chipotle mayo, avocado, pico de gallo, and I chose beef tenderloin for my sandwich. Overall, the sandwich was awesome in terms of flavor. My only complaint is that the beef tenderloin was a bit tough. I wasn't able to take a bite of the sandwich without the entire piece of meat falling out. It was a bit of a mess, and embarrassing too. Ultimately, I had to eat my sandwich with a knife and fork. Our server was very kind and although she seemed busy, she managed to take care of us very well."}
{"text":"Chill spot in the neighborhood. I've tried the burger which was amazing. If you don't want to roll yourself home, try the West of the Andes sandwich. I ordered it with tuna and it might be my new fave. It had a slightly spicy chipotle-ish mayo on it and was served with greens. Super yummy!  Tip: The bowl of chili is huge. HUGE. It's probably similar to ordering 5 cups. No lie."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go and grab a med plate. The med plates here (humus, tabouli, salad & dressing, pita bread) are by far the best in town. It does get busy pretty fast after 7 and parking can sometimes be a pain. When it is full and busy, it gets hard to hear anyone talking and it's almost like being at a club."}
{"text":"A candlelit sanctuary from the cold, buzzing with energy on a frigid Sunday night. The cozy decorations and layout create the perfect, intimate setting to enjoy the delicious fare. The bad breath burger is fantastic and the goulash is perfect for one of those sub-zero Madison evenings. The grog is a delightful treat too. Overall, this neighborhood eatery will warm you up, body and soul."}
{"text":"Initially, I found the menu to be a little bit lacking, when it comes to what I would normally order. Talk about taking me out of my comfort zone when it comes to entrees. I quickly found myself turning to Yelp to find out what others had recommended. Bob's Bad Breath Burger was seemingly unanimous, alright Yelpers, you have spoken and I am listening.  So, what scared me the most was the idea of cream cheese on a burger... what? But to be fair, I used to think P-Nut Butter on a AJ Bomber's burger was gross. Wrong, it is delicious. *Try new things* I told myself. That burger came out and the first few bites, I couldn't tell what cheese was on it - or if I would in fact have bad breath at the end. Fast-forward to the middle of the burger, yes, there is indeed cream cheese on this burger... verdict? YUM! Not too much garlic either. I really thought this sandwich would be overpowering with mouth odors. Granted, I don't think my breath was pleasant afterwards, but it wasn't atrocious.  I liked the greens that came along with the burger, and those Yukon Gold Potato slices... I want more and I want them often! My brother enjoyed his Reuben but thought the bread was a little thick. I also tried the Hot Buttered Rum - it's a new favorite cocktail of mine. Wasn't quite as good as Bluephies' but where it lacked in mixing, it made up for in alcohol.  As I looked around the room, it looked like a great, intimate 3rd date location. I'd say first date, but for me, I wanted the burger or the Reuben - not ideal on the after-meal breath. But, it felt very Madisonian to me, the decor and atmosphere just said to me that I was in Madison. I wish the place was a little bigger. I felt cramped at my table (I'm a tall guy), my knee kept hitting the leg of my table. It was also hard to get to our table - it was very crowded and every table was full.  I could see coming back again, it was a unique experience. But I'll try a night that isn't as crowded (if that exists). Also, they have Chess Mondays... I'm not very good, but I always enjoy a good game (that I don't lose in 9 moves)."}
{"text":"Unique, quirky atmosphere. Laid-back vibes. Good place to relax.  Yes, the Bad-Breath-Burger is amazing. As is the West of the Andes sandwich (with tuna thanks very much). If you like seared tuna as much as I do, this is a good option.  Ginger beer is highly-recommended. How many places can you even order that?   The service was quick and sincere.  If I lived in the neighborhood, this would be one of my go-to places."}
{"text":"If I was dying and got to pick my last place to eat out... i would pick the Weary Traveler.   Its hard for me to explain why I love this place so much.  It just has a great energy.  I have never disliked anything I ordered, they have a fantastic beer list, and it's not too expensive... what's not to like?  The West of the Andes sandwich with tuna is my personal fave but their salads are great, and my friends who love red meat say the bad breath burger is to-die-for.  I wish I could better explain my love affair with this place, but I just can't!  You have to try it out yourself!  I have never seen someone walk away disappointed."}
{"text":"It was very busy for a Tues evening. Loud but we were able to hold conversation. Dark everything in there..dark wood, dark lighting but not in a gloomy sad way. We liked it. Nice place to hang out. Weary Tom Ka Tofu-Hit the spot for a light meal. Coulda fooled me for being very thai cept the tofu was a bit chewy because it was fried. South of the Border Snack Plate-a bit pricey for the amount of guac and salsa we received, we needed more chips! Watch out for that mouth burnin' jalapeno! Drinks-very reasonably priced Service-very attentive, they don't accept American Express"}
{"text":"Weary traveler I was when I hobbled in from a hangover from the night before. I had the grilled cheese sandwich and Hungarian goulash to remedy my situation. Both items did the trick, though neither were spectacularly delicious. The grilled cheese had somewhat rubbery and hard cheese, and the grilled bread was a bit too hard, not gooey and buttery. The goulash had a good soup base though the beef chunks were quite tough, unlike how others have described its tenderness."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place and I can completely see why. The ambiance alone is so charming. It really is a collection of a weary traveler. A mixture of a classy Irish pub with a quaint Parisian cafe and everything in between. I obviously made that all up, but I really loved the entire feel of the restaurant. The entrance is around the corner and you walk through two red curtains to get to the actual dining area. My friend had grabbed a table for us in the corner and it was the perfect area. a Wooden booth with lively music spanning across time. Each of the tables have a telephone on it, which unfortunately doesn't work, but adds to the decor.   My friends and I ordered a small cheese plate, 4 Bad breath Burgers, the andes sandwich, and the carne asada. Here's my opinion on them all.   -Small Cheese Plate: enough for the 6 of us to share and start the dinner. The house made crostini's made the entire dish. It was like a bagel chip but thinner and seasoned perfectly. the meat and cheese that accompanied it however, seemed like it could be from a prepackaged deli...or grocery store. All in all it was okay, and only ~$8 so it was a nice starter  -Bad Breath Burger: We asked for our burger to be medium and unfortunately it came out more well done. It didn't leave me with bad breath, but the flavors all together were pretty good. which was surprising since it's made of cream cheese, green goddess dressing, and pickapeppa sauce. Overall i enjoyed it especially because it came with garlic yukon sliced potatoes sautéed in garlic.   -West of the Andes Sandwich: THE BEST THING ON THE MENU. I got it with beef tenderloin that was cooked medium rare. The brioche type bread was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside where all the flavors came together. the Chipotle mayo on it gave the sandwich the perfect kick and the the juices from the meat soaked into the bun. There were also mixed greens that came with it to balance out heaviness of the meat. If there is one thing you have to order here, this is it.   -Carne Asada: Unfortunately i wasn't able to try this but my friend really enjoyed it. It looked more like a fancy nacho plate, but the meat was very similar to that in the Andes sandwich. I would consider getting it next time, but i'm most likely going to just go with the sandwich above again.   The service was mediocre. Our food came out a little slow, but that was an easy price to pay for the deliciousness of what we ordered. This is one of the few places in Madison that I will for sure be back to visit! Next time I have to save some room for dessert because it sounded amazing.   Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"I had every intention of taking a picture of my sandwich while I was there today but I ate it too quickly. Get the West of the Andes sandwich, I PROMISE you will love it and if you don't please come find me and I will finish it for you."}
{"text":"It's going to be tough for me to ever order anything other than the Bad Breath Burger here. It is so good and perfect for when I am craving a burger. A really filling and flavorful dish that comes with a little bit of salad and potatoes. There are other really interesting selections on the menu. I've tried a little bit of their carne asada, which was not bad although nowhere near as good as the burger.  I enjoy the atmosphere at this place. It is a little bit darker inside but it enables nice, intimate conversation for a group or a date night. The staff is friendly and efficient but they also mostly leave you alone, which is something I appreciate when I want to have a relaxed meal or drink.  They also have board games and delicious desserts so its perfect for a hangout."}
{"text":"Followed the recommendations and ordered the bad breath burger. Good Choice. Although the daily special sounded good too. Not disappointed.  Would go there again. Love, loved the chips. Good meat, nice treatment on the toppings. Place has a local underground feel. Saw a group of 8 so know they can do that. Parking could be a problem but I found a spot in back. Also think they might have live music sometimes  The ice tea was fresh and good.all in all a good choice for this out of towner who loves a good burger"}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler Treehouse is a great place to hang out with a group of people to drink and play games.   THE FOOD: Our group ordered a bunch of things to share: -Housemade Cinnamon Roll: DO NOT LEAVE HERE WITHOUT THIS. It came out scorching hot, and was so packed with a brown sugar / cinnamon crumble and a fantastic buttery roll that it was nothing short of perfection.  -Meat & Cheese Platter: cool concept! A small is meant for 2-4 people, medium for 4-6, and large for 8-10. We got a variety of 4-5 cheeses, 4-5 meats and delicious chip/cracker/crouton things!  -Two eggs with bread and homemade jam (SUPERB!) and garlic potatoes (soggy and waaaaay overly garlicky... and I'm normally a huge fan of garlic) -Steak Sandwich: perfectly cooked with avocado! -Rueben: bread to meat ratio was off, and we didn't care for the potato salad that came with it -French Toast: again, the bread was SOOO big. Smaller bread slices would help elevate all of their dishes.   THE DRINKS: We all had different drinks... Bloody Mary was enjoyable, the mimosa was delicious, and the beer selection was on the larger side.   THE GAMES: The game selection was decent. We chose Sorry (missing a couple pieces) and Trivial Pursuit (the 1980's version hahaha).   THE ATMOSPHERE: There were families with children, couples on a date, elderly people, and groups of friends. Very diverse crowd, so everyone should feel comfortable coming! It is pretty dark, so I felt bad sitting there all afternoon and missing out on the beautiful, sunny day."}
{"text":"Food: Five stars. Drinks: Five stars James Franco Doppelganger: Five stars."}
{"text":"I bring all of my friends who come to visit to The Weary Traveler. No one has been disappointed.   I moved to Madison from Minneapolis a few months ago, and this place is definitely a favorite of the places I've tried. The West of the Andes sandwich with roasted veggies is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.   The servers are super accommodating. It was crazy busy last time I was there, and our server came back to mention to my dairy free friend that there is butter on the bun of the burger. My friend was impressed and said most servers wouldn't take the time to do that.  Only warning is not to bring anyone hard of hearing; it's really loud at dinner time. But otherwise the ambience is pretty perfect. Pretty diverse crowd, too, which surprised me a little."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Had the bad breath burger, one of my favorite burgers I've ever had.  Bloody Mary was good too.  A must try on Willy St."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! I have daydreams about the West of the Andes sandy(sandwich). The restaurant is kind of a tight fit, has low lights, and is loud- but all in a good way! If you're downtown and have time to spare this is where you should go!"}
{"text":"I went here on a weekend night for a late dinner. My boyfriend and I split the bad breath burger (if we both have it, it would cancel out the bad breath element...maybe :D), and the tom kar tofu soup. The burger was delicious! Very good. The soup was also awesome! I was in Thailand earlier this month and ate a ton of tom kar, and this soup did not disappoint! It was creamy, lemongrass-y, galanga-ey...totally great! The beer selection was good too. I would love to try some other drinks next time I go back!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place! It's different and hip; a great place to stop for a drink! Unfortunately, the bad really outweighs the good. Parking is terrible. Menu is \"meh\" and I've never had an \"out of this world\" experience with their food. Last week we stopped in, on a particularly cold day, were told \"take a small table\". We did, and noticed that is was freezing in there; everyone had coats, hats, even gloves on. We had told the waitress that we were going to leave since it was so cold. To which we got \"k,bye!\". Definitely won't be back...ever."}
{"text":"Sent here by a friend and glad we went. Food and service were awesome!  We had the meat and cheese platter, stew and of course tried the beer.  Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Great menu with many local options. I have had many wonderful different meals there. Best hipster restaurant in town in a very fun neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is a local gem. I had the tofu soup, which was memorably delicious! The vibe here is laid back and quaint. If I lived closer to the area, you'd likely see me here every day!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Fantastic food and great service and amazing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yummy Bloody Mary and nice selection of draft beer.  Bar ran a free shuttle to The Great Taste, which was a nice bonus.   Comfy, laid back decor with a book lined bar area."}
{"text":"I'm wavering between 4 starts and 5. The food is simple, rustic and heavy. When you are in the mood for something filling this hits the spot. I really like the chicken dijonnaise, more. For the garlic mashed potatoes than the chicken. In winter they have warm cocktails served in mugs that warm you right up."}
{"text":"My husband, son, and I needed brunch and scoped out this place because it wasn't downtown and wouldn't have the Packer fan crowd. We waited in the car about 15 minutes for it to open at 11:30am, but it was better than waiting an hour at ElDorado.   My son really liked the bob's bad breath burger and loves trying different burgers. It has a couple different sauces so he said it was pretty wet and seemed to have a cream cheese layer, too. He ordered it medium and it was closer to medium rare but he was good with that. He said the mixed greens had a dressing that was sort of spicy. Husband had the walleye sandwich and he agreed the dressing on the greens was spicy. Sandwich needed more poblano tartar sauce. His Bloody Traveler drink was bland and just tasted like weird-tasting flavored vodka. I had the West of the Andes sandwich with a tuna steak. Steak is a gross exaggeration. It was a great, fresh tasting sandwich with the avocado and pico de gallo, but the tuna was SO thin that it was hard to taste it. I had the \"grog\" which in my world is called glogg. Very warm, well seasoned, heavy alcohol taste that was accentuated by sipping in the fumes.  Ok, now for the bad news. The place is covered in cobwebs! Hanging from the bookshelves, all over the bathroom walls, and coating the air vents. We tried to focus on the charm--my son said it looked like a place that James Bond meets an informant--but please clean!"}
{"text":"Not too expensive for a great meal! It would be hard to find something you didn't like on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent customer service. Had lunch on Sat. Went with son and his wife. We're chatting when bill came. Glanced at bill, misread bill. Payed way to much. Contacted Weary Traveler regarding my error. They were happy to refund my overpayment. Receive the check very quick. We will be back for more great food."}
{"text":"Wonderful, late dinner a few nights ago.  Wait staff was beyond great!  Menu is small, but it doesn't look like you can make a bad choice.  I had the Carne Asada and my friend had the Walleye Sandwich - both were just what we were expecting without much of a wait.  The margaritas are excellent and there is a well rounded beer list!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious; the food and drinks are reasonably priced; staff is friendly and prompt.  The only reason I'm giving this a 3 instead of a 5 is because every time I've been there THE MUSIC HAS BEEN SO LOUD MY EARS HURT!  I've only got one set of ears and if I lose my hearing I'll never get it back.  Turn down the volume, Weary Traveler, and you'll get a 5 from me!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were here over the weekend (accidentally) for brunch - I forgot they serve brunch late! YAY for us. I got their breakfast sandwich and was not disappointed - it was great. I appreciate the healthy dose of greens for a side, it made me feel much better about the massive amount of bread I consumed in my sandwich.  My husband ordered 'Le Toaste' and said that he would do a full order - the bar tender kindly suggested that he start with a half order (because most people only finish half of their order or now order the 1/2 size) and he said that if he still felt he wanted more, he would bring him the other serving out and charge accordingly. I thought that was incredibly thoughtful and just plain good customer service. His tip was spot on - my husband was absolutely stuffed off of a half order. What a steal!"}
{"text":"Bringing my parents up to Madison for the weekend, we had one mandatory stop: The Weary Traveler. This was not my first visit, so I went for my tried and true, Grilled Cheese with side mixed greens and a Nessalla kombucha.  My parents and husband all had Bad Breath Burgers. Needless to say, I had an exceptional meal, but insisted we keep the windows rolled down on the way home. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If the Weary Traveler were my neighborhood bar, I'd be there all the time. My review may be a bit skewed since it's an hour drive for me so by the time I get there I am starving and grouchy. We were in the neighborhood a while back and wanted a burger. I hadn't been to the WT in 3 years so decided to give it a try (btw, was very happy with it the first time).  There was a fun Arcade Fire meets Trampled By Turtles band playing and the volume level was perfect for chatting. The service was charming if not a bit stand-offish. I ordered a Bloody Mary and my husband got a beer. The bloody was pretty good but every sip I took just reminded me that it was missing something. I couldn't put my finger on it. It was not missing horseradish however (hot damn!), or pickled goodness-- the skewer was nicely loaded with some pickled gems.  For food I had Bob's Bad Breath Burger. My husband had the Reuben. We shared a cup of the goulash. I would go back for this goulash. Delicious.  The burger was not a good as I remember from last time. Maybe my expectations were higher... I don't know. It was good-- it just did not have that wow factor. The hubs' Reuben was a tasty treat! I think I could give this place 5 stars if the menu had changed at all in the last 3 years. I like more variety. I'm all for small menus as long as they evolve."}
{"text":"Went to here on a Sunday afternoon.  It wasn't very busy but the service was super slow.  I got the Bad Breath Burger.  The meat was really good,  organic beef. The bun was so thick and dry that I has to set it aside in order to taste the meat. Seemed like, aside from the cheese, the rest of the toppings listed on the menu were non existent. The potatoes were pretty tasty.  I had seen via their website or a review that they supposedly had an impressive selection of hot sauces. When I asked the server about them he said they red hot, Tabasco,  or their house made.  I asked for the house.  It was a heavily vinegar flavored mild sauce that didn't deserve to be called \"hot\" sauce. Btw, I'm not one who tries to be buddies with the server, but this guy was pretty much phoning it in.  Took forever to find him to take our order and I had to ask about specials.  Overall not a terrible experience, but I'm in no hurry to return. Also, in the year 2015 is it really that difficult to get separate checks at a table of 6?"}
{"text":"We dined at The Weary Traveler as a group around 7pm on a weekday. The atmosphere was loud-ish, with music, but not too loud to have a conversation. Service was good and prompt, and food was good. I particularly liked the Mediterranean platter which we shared as an appetizer. I couldn't resist the Underground Meat's Cervalas, which was a sausage stuff with cheese and wrapped with bacon, with sides of fingerling potatoes and coleslaw, and it didn't disappoint. The deco of the place is quite cool- dim lights, vintage globes, books, violas, art.. and lots of plants."}
{"text":"I've been to The Weary Traveler twice now and it's something of a mixed bag. The food and service are good on the whole despite the fact that the place is wall-to-wall with people. It's managing that wall-to-wall crowd that is preventing them from being a really good, possibly great place. I can't help but feel that its a victim of its own success. Just so you're aware, both my visits were made with different friends on Saturday evenings in winter.  Food was fine but sort of inconsistent on both visits.   On both trips, my friends and I had the south of the border platter as an appetizer. The pico was good, chips just fine, and the pickled vegetables tasty and crisp, with the right amount of bite and spice. The guacamole was good, but may need a shake of salt...taste it and be the judge. However, both tips resulted in vastly different amounts of the items on the spread. The escabeche pickled vegetables were almost non-existent on the second visit, and my dining partner was the first to express her disappointment as that was her favorite part. I agreed, as on my first visit I was served at least 3 times the amount.  On one trip, I enjoyed a cup of good tom kha tofu. the soup was evenly spiced, the vegetables fresh and tofu firm to the tooth. Very nice. I alomost ordered a bowl again on my second trip, but wanted to try something new.  Instead, I took a chance and ordered the special on my second visit. Fried smelt with parsnip pancakes, arugula*, and chile-blood orange syrup. This is a very Great Lakes-oriented dish that has been given a world flair that had a ton of potential. Unfortunately, it worked out to be an assembly of elements rather than a complete meal. I ate less than half of it.  I was served a plate that was the rough equivalent of pasta bowl in size and shape. , The smelt were fine but a bit flavorless, most likely a result of a batter that was too thin (and probably lacked beer). The parsnip pancakes were not pancakes in the sense of potato pancakes. Instead, they were large croquettes of puree with some chunks, nicely friend on the outside and about 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch (!!!) thick. The arugula was fresh and crisp, but lacked any touch of the chile-blood orange syrup, which instead was an afterthought put on the potato cakes. The only indication it was there was a tiny spot of red color; it provided no discernible flavor to my meal. Total disappointment.  My dining partner told me she ordered the chicken dijionnaise every time she was there, and after a bite of it I couldn't blame her. The chicken was cooked marvelously and the sauce more of a light mustard cream sauce than a thick mayo-mustard sauce I had expected. The green beans looked bright and fresh and I sampled the garlic mashed potatoes and found them mild and well-made. I could see why she liked it so much!  Still, despite the crowd, we were seated quickly and treated to attentive service by out waiter. The host was a little rude on both visits, but I put it down to him being harried dealing with the crowd. When he seated us, he was very polite. Bartenders were pleasant and quick on both visits once you grabbed their attention. Be aggressive, but don't wave money. =o)  A couple of miscellaneous sparks: a good selection of gluten-free, vegan, and vegetarian items are called out on the menu. There are some interesting alcohol-free drinks on the drink menu. Also, both time I was there it was the winter, and they had some hot drinks on a small menu as well -- nice touch!  I'll certainly be back; I think my order on my second visit was just poorly executed. I'm presupposing the carne asada would be good, as would be a few other items. A third visit in spring should yield a different menu and a final measure.  Looking for a recommendation? From me personally, I'd say it's inconclusive. From the crowds and the number of bad breath burgers coming out of the kitchen, I'd say give it a try."}
{"text":"Super good food. I had the Goulash...it's not like any goulash I've ever had and that's a good thing. Hearty chunks of tender beef with vegetables in a broth with a slight kick from the spicy paprika. It ate more like a stew than a goulash. I'm not from Madison but if I have the opportunity to visit this place again I will. Great recommendation from a local friend."}
{"text":"We are restaurant owners so may be a little more particular than others but there is a level of service that one comes to expect as basic care.  The Traveler has consistently not fulfilled these basic needs.  I think it is a top down attitude.  On our last visit there was one older guy waiting on the entire room.  It was lunch and any hope of getting out in a timely matter was out the window.  The dude took our order and delivered the food, that was it.  For a second glass of wine I had to flag down an annoyed lady bartender.  They were spread very thin so it is understandable, BUT, there was what appeared to be two or three owner/manager types chatting and sampling wines at the bar.  Unbelievable! The customer is king is not a belief these people hold dear.  The food is ok but really needs a fresh revamp.  Cheese in the potato salad is unneeded, the huge pile of chips with the Carne Asada is ridiculous, the pickled garlic cloves are inedible."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Food and service...not so much. Our first server was obviously preoccupied with something because he tried to take our order the second we sat down and when we asked for a minute to look at drink menu, he didn't return for 10. Then, we never saw him again after he took our order and a nice young lady took over but was very inattentive. Never asked to refill our water glasses which were nearly empty the entire meal. My daughter's boyfriend and I both ordered the Bob's Bad Breath Burger and asked for them to be cooked to medium and they came out very well done. Not a hint of juiciness every delicious burger requires. The HUNK of unmelted cream cheese is probably one of the worst ideas I've ever tasted on a burger, probably because it didn't melt and wasn't mixed with some of the other crucial ingredients were either totally absent or hardly detectable (green goddess dressing, caramelized onions, Pickapeppa Sauce.) I'm totally willing to have bad breath over a delectable burger, but not this one. It haunted me for hours. Blech. The yukon gold potatoes were strange, half of them were crisp like potato chips and the other half was totally soft. Good flavor, but odd. The mixed greens needed a lot of help as they were just that-a small handful of mixed greens with a little dressing. No other veggies or croutons. Would never recommend this burger to anyone. My daughter ordered the Grilled Walleye Sandwich and it was just ok. The fish was not whole but broken pieces and needed help...more flavorful tartar sauce or something?? We were very let down by this place that had great potential to making our long drive to Madison worth the trip."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place by accident...a happy accident! Very busy on a Friday night, but we doubled up with some strangers (my partner's idea) and were able to take a larger table. Food was top notch. When's the last time I had Hungarian Goulash? Tonight. Huge bowl full of tender meat, veggies, and spice. Even though they were very busy, the staff was great. Food arrived plenty fast and staff stopped by often.  The ambiance was eclectic to say the least. A lot of art and a lot of stuff. Could have spent an hour just looking around. Happy happy find!"}
{"text":"The food was an original take on a lot of \"typical\" plates - everyone in our group enjoyed what they ordered! The waitstaff was incredibly accomodating to us as we had a wheelchair in our party. It was just a bit cramped/loud, which isn't much my style, but necessarily a negative for a lot of people. While it didn't leave a lasting memory or need to go back anytime soon, the restaurant certainly will not disappoint."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler is a cool, dark, large space for weary travelers to rest, drink, and eat. I thought the local beer prices were very reasonable and got the immense Bob's Bad Breath Burger. It was a very fine mix of meat topped with an aromatic combination of items, moderated by an over-sized of cream cheese. I could have used less cream cheese but was grateful for the generous plate of food after driving up from Chicago. My friend got the tomato-basil frittatta, which was reportedly very good but not as substantial as my meal. Staff was very nice as well."}
{"text":"Parking was a pain (as it usually is on Willy street), but I wouldn't mind coming down here again for some solid grub. We got the bad breath burger and West of the Andes sandwich.   The bad breath burger was a beast of a thing, most definitely flavorful, and in this garlic-lover's opinion, could have been even more garlicky! I also enjoyed the potatoes it came with, crispy and well seasoned. West of the Andes sandwich was quite original, not something I've had before and was a little bit on the tough side. Besides that, flavors were delicious."}
{"text":"Normally I would give this place 4 (or maybe 5) stars as it had a lot of character and the food was good.   However we had pretty terrible service. We were sat in a corner and basically forgotten about. While it was super busy, there were 4 servers (and a bartender) on duty. It took 30 minutes before we got a menu, then another 30 or so before we got anything to drink (not even water). In all the meal took 2 hours from when we were seated, which would have been okay if I wasn't thirsty for the first hour.   Not sure I would go back unless it was at an off-time, or if I do go back I'll make sure not to get the same server. The guy was just really disorganized. Did things like bus tables (despite there being 3 clean tables open/no need to take care of such things immediately) instead of refilling drinks/etc. Felt like a bit of a d*ck short tipping the guy, but the service really was that bad/I was worried it'd take a half hour to get my credit card or change back so I did the best I could."}
{"text":"Cornbread Update:  I think they must have tweaked their recipe, because I tried a piece of the vegan cornbread again and it was perfect. Thanks, Weary Bakers!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent grilled walleye sandwich and my husband had a reuben.  Both were delicious as were my garlic potato chips and his potato salad."}
{"text":"Average to below average.  Please tell me the special, I do not want to read it off a chalkboard set off to the side. I know that is a little diva-ish of me, but this place is small. I had to stand next to another table to read the special. I felt intrusive to the other diners. They deserve their space and I should be told the special. The service is kind of slow.   So the food?  Average. It does not make me want to come back. I ordered the highly rated West of the Andes Sandwich. And it was a torta. Nothing special. The portion and side was small for the price. I was just underwhelmed. As I write this, I sigh. It has some delicious neighbors on Willy Street, so I will probably always skip over this place."}
{"text":"Great beer, love the location, and staff is nice.  Atmosphere is friendly vibe, and this has become an East side icon for good reason.my only complaints are difficulty in finding a place to park, and I struggle with limited menu choices. You can only have the bad breath burger so many times ...."}
{"text":"A friend from Madison recommended this place for a stop on our cross country drive. The set up was a little crowded and tight but other than that, it had a great atmosphere. The bad breath burger was DELICIOUS and messy and all sorts of wonderful. The grilled cheese was good. Maybe something more exciting could be done with it but it still served its purpose as a classic favorite."}
{"text":"This place keeps on impressing me. Today I had the bad breath burger and it was filled with so many different flavors. I also love their chili with or without meat!! Today I warmed up with some coffee. The coffee I'd barriques brand roasted here in Madison. Really can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We come here on cold and dreary days and hunker down with a Bobs bad breath burger, a beer, and board game. Maybe finish with the house special, grog,  if it's been an especially bad day. We always leave feeling better. Try it!"}
{"text":"The bad breath burger is as great as everyone says it is! The garlic potatoes that come as the side are also incredible.  The guac, pico and pickled veggie plate is very good. The chips are cold and incredibly thick."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Long on my list to try and have their glorious Bob's Bad Breath Burger.  Ventured out on Saturday night amidst the light rain and Fete de Marquette.  Crowded but we were able to grab a table quickly.  Immediate and fantastic service.  A couple of drinks and our order.   I went with the above mentioned burger and it was fantastic.  House chips delish as well.  She went with a quinoa, corn and black(turtle) bean salad and it was enjoyed as well.  They did end up losing our order so server brought us gratis chips and salsa.  We were having such a nice conversation we didn't notice that food was taking a while. So the free chips were a nice surprise. Great beers on tap.  Nice neighborhood place and fantastic service. Another one on the return list."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was wonderful.  I got Bob's Burger. It was phenomenal. Really one of the most delicious burgers I've ever had. Medium rare came out medium rare."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler is a nice place to take visitors from out of town, especially those that have a choosy tongue. The menu isn't too broad, and I'd say pretty standardized, but with a twist that sets it apart from the more mundane and generic restaurants.  A staple, which I think everyone must try at least once, is the Bad Breath burger. I can't add much that hasn't already been said before, but it is honestly a high contender as one of the best burgers in Madison in my opinion. Organic meat can't be beat.  Although perpetually slammed with nearly everyone on planet Earth, when you are seated this cramped atmosphere is no longer present. I've generally always had sweet and diligent service, but I am lax when it comes to this. Feed me, check up on me once or twice, and booze me up and you are a star in my book. And the Weary Traveler does just that."}
{"text":"One of the best winter-drinking spots in Madison. Lots of windows, good warm drinks (read:glogg), and a warm fuzzy feeling. Has a very good ambiance in general.  Usually is pretty busy, so be prepared for a wait. Staff is generally pretty nice.  I think their menu has an identify-crisis, but the food impresses people. Keep an eye out for the special ice creams."}
{"text":"This restaurant, more than any other, was recommended by more people upon moving to Madison. It only took us a year to get here, but we finally did, it was a great experience. After reading the wonderful reviews you all have posted, I went with the recommended \"bad breath burger\". It was great, flavorful, just a bit a spicy, and left me with vampire slaying breath for two days. It was worth it. I would highly recommend it. My husband had the reuban. He said it was a little lackluster, but I enjoyed that as well - yes I made him share. We split the tres leches cake. Also good. I feel because so many people had recommend WT that I had a pretty good sense of what to expect. WT met those expectations. It was crowded and hosted a fun, mixed group of people. The books were a nice touch too!"}
{"text":"Not a ton of vegetarian options, but what they do have is pretty okay. During busy times, it is *very* loud and unusually dark."}
{"text":"I truly was a weary traveler when I visited this restaurant. I had spent the last two days helping my best friend move into his new apartment in Madison, carrying heavy furniture and boxes up several flights of stairs in an un-air-conditioned building. I was feeling a little drained, a little passionless, but THEN! The clouds parted and revealed to us the Weary Traveler, and we decided to stop there for lunch.  The Weary Traveler was JUST what this weary traveler needed to get her groove back. A great, kitschy vibe, friendly and attentive staff, a fully-stocked bar and, most importantly, great food! I had the Bob's Bad Breath Burger, which came with fantastic fried potatoes and fresh greens. I've had many a burger in my day, but let me tell you: this was one of the best. My best friend had the divine French toast, which was so delicious I continually begged him for another bite. In fact, the only part of this dining experience that I regret is that I didn't order one of their wonderfully huge Bloody Mary's! However, there's always next time!  In short: Whether you're a local or, like me, truly a weary traveler looking for a great meal, the Weary Traveler is the place for you!"}
{"text":"We just waited an hour and a half for our food and left because it was going to be at least 15 minutes longer before it was ready. They did cover our check for our drinks as compensation. There must've been an issue in the kitchen but I really wish we would've been told sooner that the chef was an hour and a half behind because it was quite frustrating and really put a damper on our morning. We will not be going back after this experience."}
{"text":"Great spot.  Funky interior.  Locals flock here.   Occasionally a hit and a miss with food/variety, but it's so darn cozy that all is (almost) forgiven."}
{"text":"The menu is small, but everyone can find something to love (West of the Andes Sandwich with Tenderloin is my pick) and then stick with when in the mood for something familiar, satisfying, and delicious.  They also have a few unique varying bar options, including a good array of local taps, a fun sparkling Shiraz (bottle is only $20), and Grog now that it is winter.  Dessert is very limited, but there are a few unique appetizer options (the South of the Border plate is giant and could easily feed 2-3 people for under $10), so it's a good place for dinner or snacking.  The tables are mostly small, so it is a cozy and intimate place but too squished and loud for big groups.  The service can be lousy when they are busy, but the atmosphere is so satisfying that you can settle in and enjoy your company- this isn't a good place if you are pressed for time."}
{"text":"The food and drinks at the Weary Traveler Freehouse are delicious. That being said, the place is incredibly cramped and overcrowded, service is terrible and takes forever, and the menu does not change very often. They do offer delicious vegan and vegetarian meal options. If you don't mind waiting for seating and service or a loud environment, this is still a very nice restaurant."}
{"text":"I finally made it over to The Weary Traveler and I must say I'm bummed it took me so long! Came for Sunday brunch. Brunch is served from 11:30-3:30 but they do offer the entire menu during those times. Food was excellent. I had the grilled walleye sandwich and wow, I'm already ready to eat that again. Good stuff! The fish was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The house made \"tartar\" sauce was delicious. I don't usually like tartar sauce and this one isn't quite traditional but I loved it. Excellent take on a sauce that can be overly thick and mayo-ey. It came with garlic fried potatoes and a side salad. The garlic fried potatoes were some of best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. Salad was lightly dressed-perfect accompaniment to the flavorful sandwich. My dining companion had the salmon and eggs. He was thoroughly impressed and he can be a tough sell on all things fish.   I loved the ambiance but it's not for everyone. If you are looking for something classy, look elsewhere. Weary Traveler is  an eclectic place with way too much art on the wall with absolutely no theme. Some tables have unique lamps and old school rotary phones on them. It reminded me of a place you might see in the Mission District of San Fran. I see the other reviewers had issues with service. We did not have this problem. Our waiter was prompt and friendly. Quick with the coffee refills and check."}
{"text":"It was good, but not great.  I had the special which was corn bread, bacon infused burger, and chili on top.  The corn bread was good not great.  The burger was great.  The chili unfortunately tasted like hormel canned chili.  I would rate this meal a 3 star.  My friend had the chicken, which really was wonderful.  If we had just had this, they would have gotten a 5 star rating.  I will go back and try them again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat on Willy St! I'd recommend it for lunch or dinner. I went there for drinks once, and the atmosphere wasn't quite as enjoyable. Willy Street can get crowded if you're driving, but the side streets nearby should have free 2 hour parking."}
{"text":"I had the Bob's Bad Breath Burger and I was pretty disappointed. There are a lot of other burger places that trump this one, so maybe it had to do with my high expectations."}
{"text":"Great Ruben sandwich. Cool atmosphere. Pleasant staff. Worth every penny. Will definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"This place is on my Madison go-to list... Enjoyed the Thai tofu, salmon and pork chop dinners. Selection of ales is good. I did not remember its being so noisy last year but then we still were able to talk over it this time.  Wait staff are well prepared. Tres leche cake was ok certainly not authentic but adequate.  Enjoy WT every time."}
{"text":"Did you miss the part where the Bad Breath Burger is a burger with garlic, caramelized onions, and cream cheese? Just go and get it.   I've been saying it's the best burger in Madison, but it's been a little while so I need to go back and make sure that's true.  Only excuse is if you're a vegetarian...in which case there are a number of other options."}
{"text":"All time favorite place in Madison. This is my go to restaurant for any occasion. The food is very reasonably priced. The atmosphere and food mixes traditional tavern style with some more worldly flavors. Bring a group here that includes meat lovers and vegans alike."}
{"text":"You'd expect the funky atmosphere to reflect funky (as in bad) food, but Weary actually is actually a pretty down-to-earth restaurant with affordable quality fare. The worst part is the service--it can literally take 20 minutes until you get water and then the wait staff acts like it's doing you a favor. That said, it's just part of the decorum here. Drinks are affordable and they have local microbrews, the food items are basically the chef's eclectic renditions of fast food, and despite the lax service everything manages to be served warm. You can get a burger, fish sandwich, hummus, goulash, etc. The food is hardly fringe, this is just a bar with nice shtick.   One note: If I were to make one change it would be to add two or three more non-meat items; for all of Madison's claims to 60s counterculture, there's a real dearth of affordable vegetarian fare, and I have a feeling this already-busy place would gain even more customers with such an adjustment."}
{"text":"This place is great, one of the best in the city.  Everything on their menu is excellent, but three great standouts are the bad breath burger, one of the three best burgers in town, made with local organic beef, the Tom Ka, and the south of the border snack plate. Their menu focuses on local organic farm raised produce and meats.   The service is acceptable, and improves the fewer customers there are. Expect to wait for a seat if you go during peak times.   You can get a good scotch for less than 10$, and a great drink menu. They have a wide variety of games available to play, which combined with a few large tables makes it a great place to get together with friends. One of the few restaurants that serves good food late in Madison."}
{"text":"Wow, after hearing so many positive comments about this place, I was shocked at the mediocre experience I had when here. The problems started as soon as my companion and I walked in. The space was inordinately dark for daytime, thanks to the shutters covering every window. The bathrooms were single stalls, which - as every woman knows - is a royal pain in the ass at a bar. I'd met friends for drinks here before, but I was unsure of any protocol as to whether we sat ourselves or not for a late-afternoon meal. We stood there awkwardly, looking for any kind of \"seat yourself\"/\"wait to be seated\" signs, looking over at the bartender to see if he could help us (he was engrossed in conversation with a patron), trying to find a server (they were all in the back or the other room), and generally receiving no greeting or guidance whatsoever. We eventually sat ourselves.  After several minutes, a server came over, asking if we'd been helped yet. The fact that we didn't even have water in front of us might have provided her with a clue, but apparently not. We ordered beers, which arrived fairly slowly. There were no coasters, and condensation rapidly started crawling all over the table. After our server brought the beers, we ordered the famed Bob's Bad Breath Burger to share. While we waited, we wanted to play a board game, but the shelves of board games were located behind a table of patrons, so it would have been fairly awkward to hover over them while making a selection. There's got to be a better place to put the games. Our burger arrived (points for splitting it onto two plates for us, with no up-charge for doing so) after about 40 minutes, which seemed a bit long given that the place didn't have many people eating at the time. It was a wise decision to share the meal, as it would have been *enormous* for one person. Seeing the size of other meals that came out later, huge portions seem par for the course. I was kind of shocked at how tasteless the burger was. The bun was a bit stale and hard, so every time I bit into it, the cold, hard cream cheese slipped out. The cream cheese would probably have worked better if it were warm and/or stuffed inside of the burger patty, but as it was, it was just a clumsy mess. I couldn't taste the green goddess dressing or pickapeppa sauce, but they were certainly good at making an enormous mess on my hands. I couldn't really taste the garlic at all. The tomatoes turned the stale bun into a soggy mess; blotting the slices before putting them on the sandwich would have been a smart move. The caramelized onions were visible, but made very little impact with regard to flavor, although the bun enabled them to slip out with every bite. The burger itself, which we ordered medium, was much closer to well-done, and it was dry and bland. The Yukon Gold potatoes were a burnt disaster. There was literally zero seasoning, and they arrived already cooled to room temperature. The greens were a bit dry and arugula-heavy; they could have used a touch more vinaigrette. I'd been eyeing the dessert specials for much of our time there, but after the meal was such a disappointment, we decided to walk to Chocolaterian to salvage the afternoon instead. However, this took another twenty minutes, because our server couldn't be arsed to return to our table to ask about our food or bring us the check, no matter how hard we tried to flag her down. I don't know if I've ever had service this slow or neglectful in the US, especially on a slow afternoon with at least two other servers present.  I might come here for beers again in the future if my friends want to go (although I know from past experience that it's incredibly noisy and packed to the rafters on weekend evenings, which I don't like when I want to actually have a conversation), but I'll be steering clear of the food and fetching my own drinks."}
{"text":"Such a gem!  We ordered the Bob's Organic Bad Breath Burger which was very tasty, especially with the non-traditional cheese, ketchup, and mustard condiments. Favorite part was the Pickapeppa sauce!  Also ordered The Weary Traveler Reuben. The pastrami was great, not too salty like I've had before at other spots. The bacon potato salad was a great pairing for it as well.   Haven't had a chance to return to this place, but it's definitely one of our new favs."}
{"text":"I'm back in Madison living half a mile from the Traveler. It's still so great. It's funny that a restaurant can serve a really nice Tom Kha soup and also a ridiculously delicious and artery-clogging spectacle such as the Bad Breath Burger. Love it."}
{"text":"I used to be a server at the Underground Kitchen and our restaurant suffered severe damage when the building that hosts our restaurant caught on fire- we immediately closed the restaurant indefinitely. It was an exhausting and terrible day, and I went with two close friends to the Weary Traveler that evening.  Beyond the fact that I've had a fantastic history coming here for great food, I was very moved when after enjoying my meal (salmon like always duh) my server informed me that I had been recognized by Weary management as a Kitchen server and that my meal would be on the house due to our own restaurant's bleak future. It was such a thoughtful gesture, and it really goes to show how the restaurant community of Madison succeeds- as a community. There was no dramatic offering, nothing brought that we didn't order, just a simple move right at the end that nearly left me speechless.   To Weary:  I enjoyed serving you guys when you came in, and wanted to express my appreciation for your thoughtfulness.  -Emily"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, plenty of board games available to play while you wait, sometimes the live music is fun. The bad breath burger is a fave. Sometimes hard to get a table so get there early if it's a weekend. Plenty of parking available."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood find during a recent trip to Madison. It was packed on a Wednesday night and that's always a good sign. I went for their signature steak sandwich which was excellent. Service was quick and hope to return to try their burger and a cocktail."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once with a group, and once solo.  As a solo diner, I was completely ignored.  Took forever to get someone to take my order, and never had anyone come back to see if everything was OK, to ask if I wanted another glass of wine (I did), nor water.  As a group the experience was a little better, though drink refills were tough to get then too."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing people here. I came here with my boyfriend about a month ago. It was worth it. The food was a lot I thought it would be less but gosh was the food was a lot but it was so worth it. The waiter was ok not bad. Also tried the Michigan beer it was great the ambiance was pretty chill."}
{"text":"Could just come here and just sit at the bar with the awesome music and atmosphere they have going on. THe Bob's Bad Breath Burger is outstanding. It a must to get the Calliope Ice Cream at the end. My favorites are Old Fashion ( just like the drink minus the alcohol) and the Smoked Apple (has me craving for ribs)"}
{"text":"Pub food, but a unique take on pub food. Yummy spicey Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler's food is excellent. The menu is brief but unique. I had a simple ham and cheese sandwich with cottage cheese and potato salad, which were all phenomenal. The burger, Reuben, and Andes sandwiches all looked great, too. You could tell they prepare their food with care. From my local friends there's not a bad thing to get here, and they've tried it all. Service was excellent. What bumps it up to 5 stars is the space itself. The walls are lined with bookshelves, old books, antiques, wood paneling, and a hodepodge of artwork, maps, portraits, etc. I felt like I had stepped in Indiana Jones' personal study, or the summer cabin of Hemingway."}
{"text":"An evening out with the ladies. Made our way to the Weary Traveler. Lovely joint not very busy. Service was great."}
{"text":"Love it for what it is, and don't look for more here. Dark bar scene that brings you into it's retro atmosphere with good beer and a server who looks like he and Paul Soglin were buds \"back in the day\".   I had a quinoa salad that was great and my husband had the carne asada. The meat was tender and quite delicious. Menu is limited, but hey, it's a bar."}
{"text":"The wife and i were visiting the this really neat part of Madison and walked by a little place called \"the weary traveler.\" Like a moth to a yellow porch light, I caught myself drawn to this hipster paradise. From the Lau Tzu quotes on one wall, and odd unrelated portraits on the other wall, it looked kinda like what Fridays was trying to do when they hung all kinds of weird shit around for no reason. This place is more cohesively random with glorious jam band electronica pumping in the background. I check the beer list, and alas no Budweiser available. A grin comes across my face. I search deeper and no Miller either. Are you kidding? It's been a long while since I've been to an establishment that actually offered flavor. And what flavor there is. I ordered a nutty brown pint of deliciousness and the wife orders a kombucha on the rocks.  We order vegan chips and dips. Very tasty however I caught myself getting heart palpitations from swallowing whole cloves of garlic. Still, the quality was not to be blamed. I don't know if I was cool enough to hang out here, but it was fun to pretend to be. Weary Traveler, I wish I could take you with me back home. I give this place 5 out of 5 fatty livers."}
{"text":"A bar without a bunch of TV's - amen! Place is really cozy and a nice respite, especially on a cold night.  Good selection of beers, wine and seasonal drinks and varied menu of entrees.  Great place for a relaxing drink and meal with friends.  My favorite Madison bar which is apparently a favorite of many others - always full when I visit."}
{"text":"The bad breath burger is probably the best thing I've had since moving here. I still can't get over $3 dollar beer. Great place"}
{"text":"Love this place. For starters, its a totally kooky place, they have all kinds of weird decorations, pictures of famous people, musical instruments, giant plastic chess men. The beer list changes frequently, and its always great. The menu isn't huge but everything on it is top notch. We love getting the mediterranean platter, and I love the bad breath burger. Another one of the top burgers in the city. There is just something special about putting cream cheese on a burger. Sooo good, and all the ingredients are super fresh. Also has a great brunch on Saturday and Sunday, highly recommend the steak and eggs, and the bloody mary ain't bad either. This place is so Madison, in all of the best ways."}
{"text":"Everything I've had at the Weary Traveler has been delicious.  The West of the Andes Sandwich is my personal favorite but I've never been disappointed.  The wait can be long sometimes and it can get crowded and loud which bumps it from a 5 to a 4 in my opinion.  Overall though I have enjoyed my meal every time I go."}
{"text":"We only found this spot because our 1-time yoga instructor said it was great when we asked for her recommendation. The truth is that this place is fantastic.  We split the small meat and cheese plate. Thankfully we pnly got the small! Excellent selection of both meat and cheese.  I had the daily special of a seared steak with kale and mashed potatoes. Turns out those potatoes would give my mother's a run for their money. My single complaint with the whole meal might be that my steak was a little overdone, but minor detail.   My wife loved the goulash! It was probably the best flavor and had the most meat either of us have had with a generally so simple soup.  Would go again if we were in town longer."}
{"text":"Went here on a date-type of evening with the husband. This place is loud and crowded. Food was just okay. I think it's best experienced with a group going out for drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night with the family. They were busy but still very attentive. They had a really great local beer selection that I loved! The food was just ok. I has the fish sandwich. The good, the fish was delightful and perfectly cooked! Seriously, it was beautiful! It got lost in the giant bun though. Seriously, the fish with their spicy sauce is delish... Ditch the bun! I shared my sisters grilled cheese and it was good but underwhelming. For a place with clear talents you would think they could serve a dipping sauce or add something to give it extra flavor."}
{"text":"The restaurant name perfectly described how we were feeling and the ratings made us excited to try the food but, not a place I'd order from again. The tagine is more like a big thing of chutney with pita bread. Far too sweet and a pasty consistency. I've had real deal tagine and was expecting some nicely season tagine roasted vegetables and instead got the equivalent of a jar of preserves or chutney. We added the lamb sausage which was good (comes with 1 link). The walleye sandwich had nicely cooked and fresh tasting fish but overall was bland and the bun was massive and dry. I don't usually keep much of the bun anyway or just eat half the bun but regardless this thing way overpowered the fish and was dry. It came with a side of about 6 garlic chips and a tiny side of mixed greens. The chips were good but again had about 6 of them. The super salad wasn't very super. Just a bunch of mixed greens with a few pieces of chopped fennel and asparagus (like 4 pieces of chopped asparagus and 3-4 pieces of fennel). The Marcona almonds were a nice touch but felt like for $10 I could have gone to Whole Foods and bought and entire container of mixed organic greens for $4 and had a similar salad experience. Maybe the high ratings are based on other food choices."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore the Weary T.  The food is consistently awesome--nothing on the menu is bad.  I recommend the Walleye sandwich, mostly because it comes with the world's best potatoes on the side (the sandwich is also good).  Everything is hearty and tasty.    The only downside is *sometimes* the wait is long (and there's no real place TO wait) and/or the waitstaff is slow.   Even then, though, the music is good, the decor is nice, there are board games to play, and most importantly, the beer is cold.  Why hurry?  Oh, and I forgot: They refuse to split checks.  Very lame."}
{"text":"After just getting off the plane from Seattle, a stop at The Weary Traveler seemed appropriate. Smiling faces & some good ole comfort food was just what the doctor ordered.   At night, TWT's decor is reminiscent of a divey saloon from the olden days. However, during my last visit, I got a chance to see a whole new side of the establishment. In the daytime hours, the sunlight cascading into the space creates a more lighthearted cafe vibe. It actually brings a certain serenity to the space as well, which is much needed for the tired and weary that enter.   The food is very simple. They don't seem to try to do *too* much, or try to be *too* fancy. Not so many items on the menu that you're dizzy trying to decide what to get. No fanfare. No pomp and circumstance. What you see is what you get, and what you get is a solid meal that is sure to fill you up in all the right ways.   **don't let the hunt for the entrance discourage you. The unassuming side entrance opens up to a world of goodness. Worth the short detour, for sure!"}
{"text":"We met someone for lunch at the Weary Traveler while we were in town and I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is just dark enough and just cozy enough to feel instantly comfortable. My Reuben sandwich was not really one in the traditional sense,but I totally dug their interpretation. The rye was super thick and the corned beef was as well and it wasn't inundated with cheese and sloppy sauerkraut like the typical one is. The fries were great and my iced tea had a hoppy taste and almost had me thinking I was drinking a beer. It was fantastic! I sampled my girlfriend's plate and her sandwich was great too! I want to go back."}
{"text":"Diverse food choices that all taste homemade, and I mean that in the best possible way.  My go-to is the West of the Andes Steak Sandwich, with a side of bacon potato salad (along with the green salad).  I also swear by the chilli when my wife isnt making hers at home.  Many swear by the burger.  A friend had the Chicken Dijonnaise once and I tried some and it was excellent.  I really should try some of their other menu items like the Carne Asada.  I bet they all deliver.  They are open late, which is awesome, it's hard to find GOOD food after midnight.  I did show up a couple times ~an hour before closing, only to be told they decided to close early that night.  1/2 star deducted for that.  That atmosphere is very cool (dark and eclectic) but it's almost always very loud in there and very hard to have a conversation with anyone.  Another half a star gone for that.  Definitely one of my staples, for late night and/or takeout.  Well worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Limited menu, but something For everyone, including vegetarian options. The seating around the perimeter is extremely drafty... If you are dining on a cold day, bring a jacket, I will need it! Good selection of cocktails and beer on tap. They have a Friday fish special, but other than that the menu does not change."}
{"text":"I am a simple woman with simple tastes, so I got a simple cheeseburger with garlic potatoes on the side for dinner two nights ago.  This morning I woke up still thinking about that burger and the experience we had together.  I find myself drifting off to a dreamland where that burger is only half eaten so that we may experience a bit more time together... alas, I ate it and there is no going back.  Except that I WILL be going back to get another and another and another!  How can a simple cheeseburger be so amazing?!?!   Although I had to wait for a half hour for my lovely burger, it was well worth it, and I would happily wait again!  Also, one should note that the wait to sit down and eat in the restaurant was a half hour or more, then the food took just as long, so eat a snack before you go if you are heading there on a Saturday night.  Or grab a beer while you are there to pass the time, because they have plenty of that to sell ya."}
{"text":"1 am, empty streets, Madison, WI, the state capitol building eerily lit in the background. Yelp brought me here for the Bad Breath Burger. It was an awesome burger, with garlic cooked in with the patty, a hefty slab of cream cheese, and caramelized onions all blended together perfectly.  Add to that a bottle of Lucky Louie Milk Stout (actually made with lactic acid), and the meal was perfect.  Jamie The DJ rocks! (a.k.a. DJ Lazy Bartender). He played some really mellow Bon Iver tracks on vinyl.  I would definitely come back if I ever find myself In Madison."}
{"text":"Only been there once and the service was sloooooooooooooooooooow. Maybe everyone was just stoned.  The food is great though. Biggest surprise: the french toast (seriously).  Nice relaxed atmosphere with great music playing at a decent volume to allow conversation. Good beers on tap."}
{"text":"I am happy to say that I finally got to dine here.   There is a lot to make this place great.  The food is hands down the best food I have had in the past 10 places I have gone to.  Everyone in our party of five loved their dishes. I had the Reuben and it was one of the best Reubens I have ever had.  It comes with a delicious tasting and spicy sauce that actually puts it in a category of it's own.   The bread was thick sliced and toasted perfectly.  Truly a delicious sandwich and it came with salad and potato salad.   All fresh and very good. A few negatives were that it is way too crowded.   They need to lose a few tables or get a bigger place.   They were packed at 5:30 on a Wed with people waiting.   We beat the line and got a table right away. The waitress took our orders in a timely fashion.  We had a bit of a wait for our food but nothing unreasonable considering how busy they were.   Every plate looked beautiful when served. We had a great time and the prices were spot on and very affordable. One other thing was that parking was difficult to find.  I had to park about a block away.  No big deal really.  7/2012  Hard to believe that visit was over a year ago!   Stopped in last week with some relatives that have never been there.   Got the Bad Breath Burger and it was pretty darn good.   Huge, like a good burger should be.   Very fresh and flavorful with a nice sauce.   The potatoes and greens were very good too.  We all felt the waiter could have been a little bit more personable.  He was very dry and to the point and should have taken a little more time on our orders.  It wasn't very busy either so it was not like he was rushed unless he was the only one.   And that could be.   Still a 5 star.  Food came quickly too."}
{"text":"WT is an awesome dive with a ton of character. The building is dark and old in the right kinds of ways. The staff was attentive and the beer list was fantastic.   My wife and I had a blast playing Yahtzee and taking down fine Wisconsin craft brews.   It was my first bar in Madison and left a great first impression."}
{"text":"They have Grog (Glühwein for you German types) and an amazing music playlist for catching drinks with friends. Decor is eclectic and interesting and seating abundant."}
{"text":"The wait was a little long, as is the wait for food. Waiting for our food was fine and we chatted while enjoying some nice craft brews. The atmosphere is really cool and there are some quirky things on the walls. Their food is fresh and they use local ingredients whenever possible. There are a bunch of vegetarian options. I had a walleye sandwich, which was served with Yukon gold potatoes (had a little kick to them) and greens. Tarter sauce was meh. The Wisconsin cheese platter sounded good. The kitchen is open to 1am too. Not floored by The Weary Traveler, but may return sometime for some appetizers."}
{"text":"So if you like healthy food and sandwiches, this might be your place! Just not for me. Plenty of seating and a nice open atmosphere.   As for the food....It's good, not great, just good.   I think the food itself is missing something. It seems like many of the sandwiches are just a simple twist on old favorites, yet still lacking that over the top taste. Maybe it is because their food options/side options are all so healthy and it's just not my kind of food choice? I'm not sure, I just felt like something was off.  The side's I've had have been cottage cheese with 3 small sliced cherry tomatoes and a side salad of \"mixed greens\". Yeah....boring. I admire this place being super healthy with their options, but I can have a salad and cottage cheese at home any day of the week.   The bread options for the sandwiches I've had are pretty tasty. The West of the Andes Sandwich had a great \"torta\" ish bun. Real nice! To bad the the beef tenderloin was kind of rubbery (it was very flavorful on a good note).  The Knausgaard Sandwich reminded me of a Cuban sandwich...but I think I would have rather had a traditional Cuban. Very tasty fridge pickles!  I think if they made their sandwiches and sides a little more exciting/creative this place could be awesome.  The server was very polite and on the spot.  Parking is Willy street parking/side streets."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler is a Willy Street institution and for good reason.  They've got phenomenal food and a handful of local brews to soothe your soul.  I generally get the West of the Andes, I just can't get over the memory of how damn good it is.  A great neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Just an amazing, wonderfully diverse, deliciously unique restaurant. Please go and enjoy the menu, the specials, the owners (who are ALWAYS on premise). What to try?  Everything.  if you can't become a regular, I recommend the South of the Border plate to start, the Bob's Bad Breath Burger and the Gulash. The wine list is OUTSTANDING and the bar is top shelf (with very few exceptions) at well prices.  For me, the best thing about Madison was meeting my wife. The worst was leaving the Weary Traveler behind."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, but the service on a Sat eve at 5:45 was horrifically SLOW! Waited almost an hour to receive the nightly special (tilapia) & the acorn squash w/ a pork chop. Waitress even came back & apologized but didn't offer anything. Food was good. Waitress never came back to check on us."}
{"text":"This was a favorite when I lived in Madison. On a recent visit I went there for brunch and it was everything I remember. Great food (real maple syrup!) and a cool but relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of variety and is reasonably priced.  You can accommodate your vegans as well as your meat-eaters.  The Walleye Sandwich is very good, and so is the West of the Andes Sandwich.  Honestly, I've never had anything there that wasn't delicious.  They also have some microbrews on tap.  The place itself is really cute and a cool place to hang out, even if you're just there to drink.  Bands play there sometimes too."}
{"text":"Five stars for the ambiance & deserts (which are made by a local woman!). Very comfortable atmosphere: cozy, welcoming, friendly.  If you are looking for to get away from the party crowds, and have a drink in a dimly lit, interestingly decorated bar with good service- this is the spot.   The food (the Mediterranean plate & grilled cheese) was just OK, so three stars there was decent. Plenty of vegan options, and gluten free dishes are labeled.   I highly recommend dropping by here for a drink- and if you're hungry at the time, order food."}
{"text":"I'd happily give you 5 stars, Weary, if it weren't for the aloof hipster punks running the place last time I was there. (If your'e going to loudly badmouth ALL of your customers after bar close, make sure the bathrooms are empty first. Just a tip). Oh, except for the goofily cool bartender with the hat, he was exactly what your (formerly awesome) staff used to be like. Hire more of him, less cranky people and I'll be back someday."}
{"text":"I love this place, a Willy street neighborhood classic. Love the ambiance with pleasant supper club lighting, lots of book shelves and interesting art. There are lots of tasty, savory things on the dinner menu. They also have quite a nice beer list and good cocktails. Another pretty awesome thing is that their full kitchen is open late, til bar close on weekends. Awesome place to stop in wig friends for drinks, to play some board games (they have a variety there for guests to play if they like), or for a late night meal or snack. Plenty of things here to keep everyone happy."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place and would return many times. I had the coconut tofu soup and it was outstanding; my boyfriend had the steak sandwich and also thought it was phenomenal. The atmosphere was perfect and the service was great. I would love to try their bloody marys - we saw the owner making the \"secret\" mix and it looked delicious."}
{"text":"Ever since the smoking ban this place has become less of a hipster bar and more of an aging yuppy restaurant, but the food is still good and the service is excellent.  I especially like it that they have every one of my favorite board games that got flooded out of my basement when I was 10.  Ah, memories."}
{"text":"We started out by checking to make sure they are \"accessible\", since one of us has a wheelchair.. and they are, but having not been there before, we had no idea how cramped it is. We got in through one of the front doors, but there is no foyer or open space to wait for a table. They don't take rezzies, so this is important to note -- this is a very popular neighborhood joint and fills up fast. We showed up at about 6 on a Saturday and they were already quite busy. I started tweaking at this point, because it is stressful to navigate a crowded dining room with a w/c, and worse if there is no endpoint. But I only had to suffer for a few minutes (and I'm not even the one in the w/c, just the navigator), as they quickly squoze the three of us into a small table.   The food from their small but diverse menu was a-ok and extremely reasonable, and we loved the decor of this homey corner pub in my dear Willy Street 'hood. Mom had the mustard chicken and inhaled it; sister had a bleu-stuffed pork chop and it was also quickly devoured. I had a walleye sandwich, which was not as flavorful as it could have been. The garlicky potatoes with it, however, were delish. We finished with cheesecakes all around (yummmm), and I can tell you they have a most decent beverage list, too.   I really hate the stress of no rezzies, though."}
{"text":"Fun place to go for cocktails and grub. Never pass on the meat and cheese plate. Bad breath burger pairs well with a lot of the brews they have to offer"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, they have pretty solid beer selection, and the quinoa salad was filling and delicious!"}
{"text":"Food: Great food, lots of options for vegans, vegetarians, etc. Great drinks too.  Service: Had the most incompetent waiter, so rude. He was incredibly apathetic. The food took forever to come out, multiple people's orders came out before ours and they arrived after us.   Overall probably wouldn't come back. There are plenty of better places in Madison to eat."}
{"text":"Good food, with the usual good variety of beer choices available in Madison.  Get there early if you're with a large group, the large tables go quickly.  As usual for Madison bars, I love the no smoking law :-)"}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler occupies a space on Madison's East Side Isthmus that once housed a number of restaurants and businesses - all of which came and went.  But the Weary, as it's known to neighborhood folks who frequent it, is a mainstay.  Anyone familiar with the Madison food scene knows that the Berge Brothers (and partners) constitute a dynasty - with one branch operating the Weary and Magnus and another, Barriques, among other ventures.   Yet their success is well deserved; the Berges operate some of the most consistent, finest and most comfortable food and drink outlets the city has to offer.  Despite this lineage, the Weary still maintains a humble, and appealing, feel; it's a neighborhood hangout with Django Reinhardt on the stereo and a full bar filled with service industry folk, east side residents and people who were lucky enough to stumble through.  The tables are well worn, the ambiance is dark and cozy, and the menu is great, although it never changes - yet classics seldom do.    A full complement of board games (Scrabble, Trivial Pursuit, Apples to Apples) is available for patrons, suggesting that no one expects you to hurry in and out of the Weary; on the contrary, the kitchen is open until 1 AM and you are welcome to sit and play games, cards or just chat with friends over good food until then.  The menu's standouts are, as always, the West of the Andes sandwich, whose tenderloin version comes with a beautifully cooked and tender piece of locally-sourced beef.  Or get it with a tuna steak for a lighter experience.  Both are perfectly balanced by a slightly sweet roll, pico de gallo and plenty of avocado.    The Weary's own version of the Thai classic soup, Tom Ka, is chock-full of mushrooms, flavorful tomatoes, green beans and pieces of tofu, and is brimming with rich, delicious coconut flavor.  The cup is big enough for two people to share; the bowl could feed a crowd.    For those who like burgers, Bob's Bad Breath burger earns rave reviews, too - but heed its advice and know that the garlic will do your friends in post-dinner.  Cocktails at the Weary are stiff and no-nonsense; the Old Fashioned is always a good choice, as is the Mojito.  The Weary also offers plenty of good beers on tap and in bottles, too.  I hesitate to put up such a rave review of the Weary, which feels like our own little neighborhood gem, but word gets around, anyway, and it's only fair to give it its due.  There's more than enough room for everyone, anyway, and all are always welcome."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday around 6:00 without reservations and were quickly seated. The beer list is really broad and inexpensive, which I was happy to see.  We got the southwest sampler to start which came with a lot more chips than guac but still was tasty. It came with pickled onions and carrots as well which I realllly liked.  Bf got the bad breath burger which needed a little salt or something because of all the sweeter components. I had the walleye sandwich which was good but didn't have very much walleye on it unfortunately. The homemade buns that each were served on were fluffy and delicious tho! Sammie's came with greens and homemade chips."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Decor is extremely unique and very interesting, and atmosphere was very chill. This restaurant is not good for picky eaters or if you are just looking for comfort food (hence the four stars). The menu is relatively limited, and all options are very unique...there's for sure no chicken strips and fries served here! None of my typical \"go to\" options were on the menu, but i was still quite happy with my meal. I normally only order chicken, but didn't like what they paired their chicken entrees with, so I tried a prime rib sandwich and it was delicious! My fiancé got the bad breath burger, which he described as having two full cream cheese sticks on it and as being awesome. The beer draft selection also required stepping out of my comfort zone as they don't have many light/hefeweizens on tap, but they were pretty decent none the less."}
{"text":"Dim bar, cold drink, good tunes, Bad Breath Burger.   Oh yes.   This is SUCH a great place. They always get great live music, and it's fun to sit down with a sampler and some friends and actually get to HEAR them talk. A mellow place to catch up or settle down."}
{"text":"Good food, not to shabby of prices.  Good and  relaxing.  I love the idea of having board games there."}
{"text":"After clowning around on the outside to figure out where the entrance door is (despite them giving somewhat helpful instructions), we finally ventured in for lunch this past week.  Decor : Quirky would come to mind! An old bicycle hanging above, a set of mirrors looking down at you, some artifacts that looked like old maps of sorts hanging around. There's a ton to take into while you wait for your food!  Service : Pleasant, no issues here  Food : Their Main Menu is a nice mish-mash of several different cuisines and thankfully limited and not some 200 dishes encyclopedia like you get at some chain restaurants.  We ordered a portion each of Bob's Bad Breath Burger and The Weary Traveler Reuben (Pastrami). So, first things first - their portions are HUGE. I've never had a burger this big (not that I've had a lot anyways to compare!).  The burger had a unique twist of having your typical cheese replaced with cream cheese and I actually loved it! It doesn't give any sharpness to the bland meat like say a cheddar would but the creaminess is a pleasant contrast. The caramelized onions were sweet and paired well with the creamy cheese. The meat itself was Medium Done which I wasn't a big fan of (I'd asked for Medium Rare). Still overall a great burger. My only gripe was that the choice of bun wasn't the best as it had a hard time holding it together and kept deteriorating. A side of their Garlicky potato chips was sensational and the greens helped balance all that meat.  The reuben was actually the more enjoyable dish here. The pastrami was juicy, the kraut tangy yet sweet thanks to the apple cider and the rye bread was the perfect carrier for it all. The execution of this sandwich was done much better than the burger. The bacon potato salad side was creamy, smoky goodness!"}
{"text":"In response to a previous reviewer who claimed that the burger is the only compelling reason to visit, I beg to differ. I've had the pork chop on two occasions and it has been mouth-wateringly delicious on both counts. The pork is from a local farm (Jordandal) and you get an extremely generous portion, perfectly cooked and seasoned, served with potatoes and delicious greens. This meal costs $12.75. What appears on the plate could easily satisfy expectations at price three times that at an upscale restaurant. Truly the best \"bar food\" in town...(with Natt Spill a close second.) Not every item on the menu is this good, but the consistency means you can pick your favorites and stick with them."}
{"text":"Color me unimpressed!  We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant definitely embraced the \"lazy sunday afternoon\" moniker.  Many of the tables still were occupied with the empty vessels of diners before and the waitstaff was almost non existent.  Once we did get the privilege of ordering our food, we again waited....and waited...and waited...for our food. I was very underwhelmed by the Bob's Bad Breath Burger.  While the description sounds amazing, the execution was poor.  It left me neither satisfied nor with bad breath.   I have eaten here in the past and was always happy when I left.  Is it the case that the restaurant staff had post-freakfest hangovers or is the restaurant simply resting on its laurels and hopes the bearded and the flannel bearers keeping flocking to a declining (and very average) restaurant?  I don't know the answer but probably am not going to give it a second chance to find out.."}
{"text":"This weekend I went to Weary Traveler for lunch. I was excited to see what all the fuss was about and it was definitely very good.   The people in my party ordered one of two things: the West of the Andes sandwich or the Bad Breath Burger. I opted for the West of the Andes sandwich because I thought the Bad Breath Burger looked a little overwhelming. I had it with the steak and I thought it was delicious. I like that it was served with a salad, too. I also tried a bite of the Bad Breath Burger. Definitely an experience, but I don't know if I would have been able to stomach more than a bite. The side potatoes it was served with were also very good.   The atmosphere in Weary Traveler is really neat. The decor is cute and they have board games you can play which makes me very happy - especially because we played Apples to Apples. I will definitely return if I am able to hike over to Willy Street."}
{"text":"When I arrived in Madison it was late, I was tired and all I wanted was a burger and some fries. I thought the Weary Traveler would be perfect.   Alas, you don't serve French fries. You have a burger on your menu called Bob's Bad Breath burger and no fries?! Sigh. This is the ONLY reason I couldn't give you higher than 3 stars. Burgers + sandwiches + bar -fries= sadness.   The servers were really nice. Seated our party of 12 quickly. I had to go grab menus for us after about 10 minutes of sitting there but that's ok. You were pretty busy. My friends liked your drinks menu. However not too many appealing food options.   I ordered the Mediterranean plate. Salad, hummus, tabbouleh and pita chips. It was tasty and just enough to sate my hunger at 8 pm.   Some ordered the grilled cheese, the bad breath burger and the ace burger. All burgers are grass fed with Wisconsin cheese. My friends said they were just ok. Not enough seasoning on the burger. All burgers served with little greens salads. The kitchen didn't cook the burgers medium rare, the way they were ordered. That was a little disappointing.   Old school Board games available (Clue, Battleship, etc). No tv to watch sports.   If I'm ever back at Madison this won't be one of the first places I visit. I think there has to be better burger joints around."}
{"text":"It's a solid 3.5 stars.  I would not rave about the place, but you not likely to walk away disappointed.  If you just want a good burger in a casual place, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about weary traveler, and the hype excited me to dine here.  I came here on a Saturday night. The bar was full, but I didn't feel too crowded. I put myself down with a table of 10. While waiting, we all ordered drinks off the menu (mojitos, Tom Collins, cosmo, etc). The bartender was awesome and extremely accommodating. Kudos Weary! We waited around 45 minutes and were seated at a corner table across the bar. We played BS with a pack of cards while we waited. I was having so much fun that the wait for food felt minimal.  We ordered the nacho plate (with pico de gallo and guacamole) as an appetizer. They were out of guacamole, so we were served the nachos with pico de gallo and avocados. It was filling, but I do not plan on repeating this experience without guacamole. I ordered the carne asada as my entree. Again, served with avocado instead of guacamole. The meat was too salty (and too peppery for my boyfriend), and the nachos were soggy from the pico de gallo. It was tasty, but I wasn't satisfied in the end. I plan on ordering the burger next time. I found myself stealing bites of my boyfriend's burger throughout our night. Our server was awesome, and she gave our friend a special brownie cake for her birthday.   The combination of drinks and games, the loud but festive environment, and the accommodating servers made for a pretty cool night. Food was three stars for me, but I definitely plan on returning for the experience."}
{"text":"I could spend a lot of time in this place just looking at all the cool stuff on the walls. Way way way too noisy and you are kind of crowded with people and conversations very close. Food was decent and priced OK."}
{"text":"Brunch. YUM. Just...so much yum. Perfectly fluffy scrambled eggs, delicious sausage, insane french toast. I wish I could've tried the bacon, but they were out. Maybe for the best though, because I probably would have died right then and there. Also, Jeff the bartender is great - attentive without being pushy. I like.  Food=10 Relaxed atmosphere complete with chill bluegrassy band=10 Price=10"}
{"text":"Loved all of it...from the setting, the service, and the meal.  I had the Reuben and it came out delicious and well-toasted...best part yet, was not a heaping greasy mess.  Only downfalls...No where to sit while waiting for our table and parking was crunched on a Saturday early evening."}
{"text":"Oh my God.  The Ruben.  Oh my god.  Lots of interesting menu options that do NOT just roll off the back of the Sysco truck - there's some real creativity served here.  Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Great service, great food (although the menu is small, all the food is delicious)!!!  I am a big fan of the fun and laid back atmosphere!!!  Definitely a must go to!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the BITCH  The food is amazing, the drinks are reasonably priced (but not fancy), and the decor reminds you of what Applebee's is trying to capture but can't. Food is really varied (not like that is a bad thing). I like the Reuben"}
{"text":"small, cozy little restaurant.  great menu.  fresh tasting food.  Hungarian goulash is my favorite."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler is Madison, Wisconsin. That is an odd statement, but perfectly true.  It is part bar, which is requisite on account of this being a state that is very much about beer. The bar is a real bar. Not old-timey, not fashionable-hip, but a conglomerate of 20-80-somethings with unusual eyewear and hairdos, sitting around talking about the academe, but quite sincerely. The food is real bar food. Not a bowl of nachos. Not an ashtray of pretzels. Bar food as in the kind of food you might find in a bona fide Irish pub, you know, in Ireland. You can get nicely browned chicken with mashed taters there. Burgers. It's a short menu, but a real menu. You can definitely eat a good meal at the Weary.  Word to the wise - don't bring kids here. It's really crowded and no place for strollers or binkies. It's a place for grownups, young and old. You can't help but like it."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler was my first introduction to Madison and set the tone for a great visit with a family member who had just moved nearby.  If I lived in the neighborhood I'd eat at the Weary regularly with friends.  It seems like a great place to meet new people, given the warm woodsy layout and the low-tech emphasis (board games). In addition to the neighborhood vibe, the food was homey too. My $15 pork loin special with celery root side was delicious.  My dining partner happily consumed the Bad Breath Burger.  I had one of the many tasty beers on the menu - in fact you could make a game of trying all the beers.  This seems like a cozy place to settle in on a cold Wisconsin night.  I look forward to many return trips."}
{"text":"The weary traveler is one of the best restaurants on willy st. Tonight we got the special which was thinly sliced flank steak cooked really tender on ciabatta with goat cheese, Carmelized onions, and arugula. It was so good with a side of garlic fries potatoes and a salad for 12.50. So it's a little pricy but the portions are big and definitely worth it. They have lots of other good burgers like bobs bad breath burger which is exactly what it sounds like but really rich and tasty. Interesting cocktails and even more interesting decor all over the walls from every decade. Definitely a must visit while in madison :)"}
{"text":"totally feels like a weary traveler's treehouse... casual open space with lots of wood. ordered the andes sandwich- tuna steak on brioche was super tasty- only issue was the excessive amount of chipotle mayo smeared all over the bun, oozing all over the plate..generous portions of avocado and a big green salad to balance things out. i feel like the menu is missing things... like smaller dishes for peeps who want to share or who don't necessarily need a big meal. sides would also be nice (like those fried potatoes they serve with the burger that my friend raved about!) would prob recommend for a friend who was craving a beer and burger... that kind of place."}
{"text":"Ambiance is cozy, romantic, a little eclectic. Definitely different than most places. It feels like you're eating at your neighbor's lodge in the mountains who is a bit of a hoarder but in a good way. It's fun to look at all the hanging artwork or if you have the time grab a board game from their game library nook. Been here twice so far. Once for brunch once for dinner. Both times enjoyed my meal greatly!  Bob's bad breath burger is a little messy to eat but totally worth it. One of the top 5 burgers I've had in Madison I would say.   For brunch I got the Andes sandwich with the tuna steak. Came with avocado, chipotle mayo and some other veggies. I say what makes a great sandwich is the sauce. Whatever they put in this sandwich is addictive. I was hoping to save half but ended up eating the whole thing. Both the burger and the Andes sandwich were packed some pretty intense flavor. There was not a single dull bland bite.   They don't really do appetizers here. It's mostly entrees and sides. But the entree sizes are more than enough to keep you satisfied."}
{"text":"It's very rare that I order a burger, but since trying the Bob's Bad Breath Burger it's what I choose almost every time I stop by. It's a mess of a meal, but the lighting at the Weary is so dim and the seating so randomly positioned that no one will notice the melted cream cheese dripping down your chin. In addition to the genius of cream cheese on a burger, the side of garlicky pan-fried potatoes and lightly-dressed greens are something I tend to immediately wolf down. On my last visit the greens had a surprisingly spicy kick, an addition that I hope sticks.   The one place where the Weary has sometimes lacked is the service - the waitstaff is invariably polite, but in recent trips I've been given the wrong leftovers (I'm still mourning the loss of an amazingly tasty loaded grilled cheese that I ordered with the express purposes of saving half for dinner) and been urged to order my burger rarer than requested because \"[well-done] takes too long to cook.\" While these situations aren't ideal, the good far outweighs the missteps and I've kept going back."}
{"text":"The Hungarian Goulash is one of the most comforting and delicious bowls of food in the city.  The most recent time that I went here,my boyfriend ordered a bistro steak special that they had on the board, and it was outstanding. It came with the most amazing mashed potatoes and beet greens.  The service is always great, the drinks are always strong. There is nothing negative that I can say about this place.  On a weird random note, I have always been impressed at how all of their books and nick-nacks used to decorate the dining room and bar are never dusty. This may seem trivial, but it just shows me how much pride they take in their restaurant to keep it perfectly clean."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Weary Traveler in a number of years. The place was hopping on a Wednesday early evening. The Old Fashioneds were decent.   The Medium Meat and Cheese Plate was huge and had these great bread chips... Not really crostini but really good. The meats from underground were the standout - the cheese was nothing special and looked like pre-sliced aside from the Blue.   The Bad Breath Burger was a disappointment. I ordered it rare it came medium well. The meat itself had been overworked and had more the flavor and consistency of meatloaf.   Over all despite how busy it was, the service was friendly and pretty efficient - the place had a good vibe."}
{"text":"Love their infamous quinoa, black bean, corn and avocado salad with sliced steak. Remembered it from a business trip three years ago and had to return. Yeah, it was still on the menu. Nice casual ambience. Friendly and prompt service too!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that I found this gem! It is my kind of place- books on shelves, great tap beers, and fresh delicious food. I loved the menu, and the bloody marys are fantastic. I definitely hope to travel back to the area to go back for more!"}
{"text":"I like this spot. Bob's Bad Breath Burger is delicious, the West of the Andes sandwich is fantastic, and I hear rave reviews of the Goulash and chicken dishes. Lots of beer choices (although not  much of a distinguishing factor), and pretty good mixed drinks. Staff is very friendly. I overall dig the sort of pancultural vibe that it gives off. I'm honestly not sure the Weary Traveler has a defined identity, unless that identity is the sort of generic East Side Madisonite (without endorsing or judging). I never quite understand the ambiance there, but I certainly don't mind it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet!   I am sure I am not going to say anything that hasn't been said yet but this place is great!  The decor is very relaxing.  The bar area is a bit small but that doesn't bother me because I only come here for their delicious delicious food!    The menu is small but everything that I have had here has been great!  A few things that stick out are the hummus plate and the ruben sandwich.  The man has had their bad breath burger and loves that too!  The service is always great and the prices aren't bad.  I actually wish I lived closer so I can try more things on their menu!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place. The food is unique and they offer enough variety to make each visit something to look forward to. The decor on the walls is pretty interesting. There's a funny \"family portrait\" that had me giggling.  At brunch I had an asparagus and swiss cheese egg frittata with amazing toast and three different kinds of jams that I never would have thought to try. The tuna steak sandwich is delicious and reasonably priced. My mom seemed to enjoy her reuben. :)  The reason I gave four stars instead of five is because I've been disappointed with their drinks. My bloody mary at brunch looked impressive with pickled brussel sprouts, mushrooms, onions, and olives, as well as lime and lemon wedges, but it was surprisingly bland. It did, however, get me pretty tipsy. And at a previous visit my rum and diet tasted so strange that I couldn't finish it. However, I did try Lake Louie on tap for the first time here and now I'm a big fan.  This place is definitely one of a kind. I'm looking forward to the next time I go, and hoping I'll have better luck with the drinks."}
{"text":"Best place to eat, drink and hang with friends on the isthmus.  Period."}
{"text":"We went to Weary after a 5-month hiatus due to horrible experience last fall. It was time for redemption! However, this trip, we also watched others served before us and were delivered lukewarm food again. We're sad, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"We only stopped in for one drink the other night, but boy howdy was that a strong martini! Boodles gin and olives, surrounded by taxidermy and globes, perched on a giant chess board mini stage...fun. Our server was cool, seemed like he could just pull up a chair and tell us some stories about his time at The Weary. I hear this is one of the only places in Madison for decent late-night food, so I'll have to be back!"}
{"text":"The Weary is a wonderful place to get a beer and meet up with friends, either a one on one or group setting. The servers I have had have all been pleasant. Beer list is great. I wish the menu changed more often or had more smaller snacking options. The Bob's Bad Breath burger is a must and I find myself wanting to order one even when I'm not hungry because it's so delicious! When you come in you are more than welcome to seat yourself - or so it seems- but I like to make eye contact with someone working before I sit just to be polite."}
{"text":"we went here last night with a group of friends and got beers at the bar while waiting for a table. the beer selection isn't the greatest, but it's pretty solid. we enjoyed some potosi cave ale and were seated in about 20 minutes. not too bad for a group of 6 on a saturday night, especially considering there was a huge line of people waiting.   i had the bad breath burger, which truly lived up to its name. the beef was quality, and all the toppings on it were garlicky, cheesy, awesome goodness. the bf had the reuben and said it was pretty tasty too.   i think it's safe to say we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Cute decor, looked like a fun place until we sat down at the bar and had to deal with the Asian female bartender (noting this only because didn't catch her name....or service for that matter)  Thank you to the guy that told us she's always like that..I feel for you.  Ill repeat...You're in the \"service\" industry..please go home and don't work if you can't handle people even if your having an off day.  I've bartended I know.   I don't recall the last time I felt so disrespected in a bar when I'm the customer spending my money.  Words of advice:  (from experience)  1. Smile 2. Act friendly (even if you don't feel like it) yes, your tip depends on it 3. If asked a question, answer it :) 4. Seriously - dress for success - PJ's are for home.  We left within 5 mins of being there and told her she sucks... And you do.  Unfortunately, you missed out on a fat tip....it's across the street at jolly bobs with the bartender that does the above... See list 1,2,3,4.  Some may feel this is a harsh review but first impressions are everything.  Cheers :)"}
{"text":"I have given the Weary Traveler three stars.  I've been there twice and had the same thing-- Bob's Bad Breath Burger.    The first time it was delicious-- the perfect late night finish to a night of moderately heavy drinking.  The second time-- tonight-- it was just terrible.  Waaaaay too much balsamic vinegar and the potatoes were incredibly salty."}
{"text":"Every time I've gone to Weary I've had to wait for about half an hour or 45 minutes to get a table. Fortunately, the incredibly friendly staff and food always makes up for the wait (plus, it's my own fault I consistently show up at 6 pm on Friday nights. Oops).  Weary's got a slew of solid vegan options. From the Tom-Ka tofu bowl to the vegan chili (with cornbread that runs a bit dry, but is great crumbled up in the stew) to the Quinoa Turtle Bean salad, I always enjoy my food by eating it as quickly as possible. I can't help myself, soooo good!  The ambiance is the best part about The Weary. With some mood lighting, rustic wood interior, and cool kid vibe, it's a great spot for a date. They don't take reservations, so just don't show up during the dinner rush on the weekends."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend who frequents this place quite regularly, right in the heart of willy st, I decided to stop in for lunch, it's a quaint little place that you would never guess has as good of food as it does.. The vegetarian chili was the best I've had in Madison thus far!!!  Just for that I will go back to try other menu options that appeared to be great selections... Staff was very nice but although busy, still was very much attentive to our needs..."}
{"text":"One of the best things about the Eastside. A nice cup of chili and a grilled cheese costs around $6. The people who work here are totally friendly. You can sit and play a game. Nice music is always playing, plus it isn't totally loud.  One note of warning though; the weekend nights can be kind of a mess. They don't seem to have much a seating system, there doesn't seem to be a host/hostess, and you can watch a table or a seat at the bar that you thought was about to be yours get swooped up by a more wily patron. But it is just that great of a place that you don't really care.  EDIT: This seems to have been fixed. Several Friday nights I have gone there and the seating situation is much less chaotic. You will still have to stand in the hallway 3 deep because it will be packed."}
{"text":"Who charges $4.50 for extra guacamole?? The Weary Traveler, apparently."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler is definitely a Madison staple. Delicious food and a cozzy atmostphere make this place one you'll always come back to. The walleye sandwich is amazing, as is the goulash and bad breathe burger!! Its hard to have a favorite here when all the food is fantastic!! The place can get packed rather quickly though, so if you have a large group better arrive sooner than later.  If you're not sure where to eat, the Weary Traveler will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but the burger was a complete let down. I ordered the Bob's Bad Breath Burger and could only eat a few bites before I felt totally queasy about the entire situation. The meat both looked and tasted funny to me, and I kept biting down on something hard. All of this was quite disconcerting so I ended up sharing my toddler's grilled cheese with her. I would definitely go back to try something other than a burger since the atmosphere was nice, but I will not be making any special trips to revisit."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler earned it's wings as a neighborhood watering hole and restaurant by being many things to many people.  This was accomplished by creating a friendly, if somewhat chaotic atmosphere during it's busy periods, complete with board games, different sized tables and a generally competent staff.  Having said that, know that this place is capable of making mistakes with regard to \"exact\" food orders, and you will occasionally interact with an inattentive bar tender or a server with a flat personality.  But this is the exception rather than the rule.  Also know  that on nights when there is a popular show at the Barrymore, or even downtown, you will need to arrive early to get a table.  Madison's near east siders have a lemming like quality when it comes to descending on popular bars, and The Weary now qualifies as such.  As to the food, there is a range of options which one must explore on repeat trips to get the full impact.  The popular Bad Breath Burger is good enough, though it's size and generally imposing quality should be considered a commitment to all but the truly hungry diner.  Other items range in price, size, nutritional value and consistency (tip: the potatoes are often served at room temperature, as they are likely pre-made in batches). Suffice it to say, if you like it the first time, you'll probably be back."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler is my pick when I can't decide where to go. They're consistently satisfying and the bar is a great place to sit for a drink with friends.   Make sure you go early (or later in the evening) otherwise you'll soon realize you had the same plans as half of East Madison."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler was our first stop after the drive from Minneapolis... so you could say we WERE the weary travelers. Ba-dum-dum-ching!  It was packed inside, so we waited at the bar for a table to open up. Though I didn't partake, the beer list is absolutely fantastic, as it is almost everywhere in Madison (I'm convinced). My fiance ordered a cute Rhinelander shorty while I surveyed the scene of vintage mirrors and comfortably kitschy decor. I decided that this is probably the neighborhood we'd live in if we lived in Madison.  Once we were seated, our server wasn't the greatest. She forgot a few things, though to be fair I had kind of a confusing/obnoxious order. I asked for the bad breath burger with no bun, no cream cheese and all the sauces on the side (It came with the bun. I also asked her if she could find out what was in one of the sauces for me, but I had to remind her twice. And there were no onions on either of our burgers, even though the menu says they are supposed to come with them.). I realize my order was annoying in the first place, so I don't want to fault her too much but she did also forget to put in my guy's soup so that came after our burgers did. And she wasn't totally on top of our drinks either.  The food totally made up for the spotty service though. It's bar food, but all seemingly homemade (down to the ketchup). I'd definitely get this burger again, considering I ate it deconstructed, it was slightly overdone (medium well vs. medium) and it was STILL perfectly delicious. It's an organic burger with green goddess dressing, garlic, hot sauce, tomatoes... and since we realized we were missing our onions, the server brought us a giant cup of caramelized onion goodness. The onions make the dish.  The burger also came with mixed greens and an amazing orange-Serrano chili-lime vinaigrette. It looks like this dressing also comes on the roasted veggie salad and that sounds wonderful too. I was in the mood for a burger that night, but the special board was really tempting. It was seared scallops with sauteed spinach and I think a bourbon-brown-sugar glaze. And it was only $13 or some such nonsense. That's like stealing."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Weary since I can remember. I always went there with my family and have continued to go there with family and friends. It's one of my favorite spots in Madison. The staff are amazing, friendly and accommodating. The food is great - I know the menu like the back of my hand. The ambiance is unmatched. As I said, this is one of my favorite spots, if not my favorite, in Madison. Will recommend to friends and will never stop going!"}
{"text":"Extremely fun, comfortable, quirky, and eclectic. They have a unique mix of upscale bar food and elevated, classic American dishes.   My girlfriend and I went there for lunch on Saturday and found a packed house, but we were able to find a table in the back next to a stack of boardgames. Playing dominoes and having a beer while waiting for your bar food was a surprisingly fun experience!  We ordered the Meat and cheese plate and it was one of the best I've had! Rotating specialty cheeses and high end meats. Hard to beat.   We got a burger and the chicken and waffles. Both would be worth getting again. Give this place a look next time you're in Madison!"}
{"text":"Weary traveler feels like home.   I most recently stopped in for dinner to kick off my birthday celebration with a small group of friends and it was exactly the right way to kick off a laid-back evening. Although they don't split checks, they are very accommodating to groups. It can be crowded and a little loud at times but the weary always feels like an extension of my own living room, all the way down to the stash of board games in the back corner - a favorite wintertime hangout for me. The menu is short but sweet - I struggle not to order the west of the Andes sandwich every time because it just hits the spot. And, one of my favorite perks, plenty of bike parking and a place to hang your helmet and jacket!"}
{"text":"I really really liked my bob's bad breath burger here. I don't know what it was exactly that made the beef so good, but it had almost a spongy texture. The various toppings weren't so stinky as to be objectionable in polite company. Maybe not something to order on a first date, but if it's meant to be, you should be good on date #3.   I also like that the wallpaper is San Francisco themed. Nice touch of home."}
{"text":"It took three trips here for me to truly love the food but then I really hit the jackpot! The tom kha soup is delicious and the west of the Andes sandwich is perfect!! Fun beer selection and quirky atmosphere. I've had mixed experiences with the service.  Wouldn't recommend the breakfast frittata or the chili. So basically: if you order the right thing you can be in for an awesome casual dinner."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place because I was hungry and it was late and I happened to be near it at the time. I had the salmon and it was good. I plan on trying it again at some point the next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"The wife, baby and I stopped in for Brunch this past Sunday due to my friends kept raving about this place.  Upon entering the cloth curtains, the room was 75% full. In the room we were in, there were only two waiters waiting on everyone and we stood for 5 minutes unnoticed.  The bartender to the right didn't bother to greet us either.   It felt awkward and after noticing many customers still waiting to be served, we figure it'll be a long wait since they're under staffed.  It was a dissapointing first impression.  Maybe we'll return again in the spring and hopefully they'll be better staffed."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food is great.  My favorite items are the bad breath burger that so many rave about and the surprisingly good tom ka tofu.  Beer selection is also pretty good, and seems to rotate occasionally.  This is the kind of place that draws you back in with its food, comforts you with its atmosphere, and wins you over with their alcohol.  Go here."}
{"text":"I actually hate  the term \"hipster\", but for this one time, I will use it to describe this restaurant. It is very hipster and from what I heard all organic, although I don't know how valid that is. I guess it doesn't matter to me if it's organic or not (I know, I know, I should care more).  My friends always talked about this place and their sandwiches so decided to go before I left Madison permanently. West of the Andes Tuna Steak Sandwich with avocado, pico de gallo and Chipotle mayonnaise. YUMMMMM. It was sooo sooo good. I didn't get a chance to taste the rest of my friends' dishes but from the silence I think I can assume they enjoyed their food as well.  Can't wait to go back and take my boyfriend here."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, but I think our server was a little weary.  Took over an hour to get our meal.  Didn't bother to check on us, refill water glasses, or let us know about the delay."}
{"text":"Soo not impressed.  I ordered the goulash, it was very bland and weirdly spicy at the same time...salt people!  Come on!  I am also accustomed to noodles in my goulash and there were none.  I also ordered the meat and cheese platter that came out messy, looking and tasting like I ordered a deli party platter from the grocery store.  There was supposed to be chicken liver pate on it and it came without, the waitress claimed it was out if season.  I wasn't aware chickens came in season...  Also the waitress had to be tracked down for every small thing.  I was not happy with my experience and I won't be back.  Oh, and the booth by the window had a subzero windy draft blowing down the back of my pants through the booth crack my entire dining experience.  Very unpleasant.  I was so disappointed. :-("}
{"text":"Weary Traveler is a cool, inexpensive atmospheric old bar on Madison's hip East Side. It has more than a few vegan options but not the kind that I expected.  For one thing, they serve bar food here (burgers and whatnot). Yet, amazingly, they don't offer a home-made vegan burger or anything akin to that. It's a shame because this is the type of joint I'd expect to find a killer seitan burger, or tofu-quinoa-type patty. Even stranger, they have all the right ingredients for a killer vegan burger, but they don't seem to be able to put the pieces together.  While everything they have is labeled and cheap (prices range from $3.75-$7.75) none of the vegan dishes sound particularly interesting (options include: vegan chili; sweet corn quinoa blackbean salad; tom kha tofu stew; roasted vegetable salad; hummus-tabouli plate; guacamole-salsa plate).  I got a cup of vegan chili ($3.75) which came with a piece of cornbread. The chili was okay but not great. While it was spicy, I didn't like the overly-thick nature of it and the uninteresting ingredients. Where were the bell peppers? Or mushrooms? Or tvp? All this chili had was tomatoes, onions and beans which are okay, I guess, but pretty boring.  The cornbread was good, though. The service was friendly too. I generally like the atmosphere here (cozy and dark with lots of wood and a long bar). The beer selection and draft selections are also both unusual and extensive (with lots of local beers).  I just wish Weary Traveler had better vegan options. Then I'd come back often and I'm sure other vegans/vegetarians would as well."}
{"text":"I used to live less than a block form the weary traveler when I lived in Madison, and wanted to see if it had lost its charm. Nope.  It's so warm and inviting. Food is nothing less than awesome. I was disappointed that the vegan chili isn't on the menu anymore, but I settled for the stand-by walleye sandwich. Soooo good.  Drinks...I don't remember them being that cheap. But I guess they are. Service never has been that great, but eh...it wasn't bad. Just a hipster attitude that really isn't necessary.  Also, bad move replacing Quolfrisch with Stella. Not. Good. That's why you lose a star. And the tude. But I'll definitely go back whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Eclectic restaurant for an eclectic town. Cool Worldy travel decorations around the world. It is a bit dark inside to appeal to the ambience, which was neat!   I have been here a few times and enjoyed every visit. On my last visit, I noticed their shelf of board and card games and started playing the \"Bad Beets\" game. The food came so we left the game unfinished. The Tom Kha Soup with tofu was really good. We ordered a side of rice, the wild black rice, to mix in with the soup. It normally doesn't come with the rice, but the bartender said customers usually ordered the soup with a side of rice.  Tried the snack platter as well, which came with guacamole, salsa, and pickled veggies. Watch out for the pickled garlic! I love garlic, but I could only handle one clove bite which gave me breath a lasting overnight garlic breath even after brushing my teeth. The ratio of chips to salsa and guac were a little uneven. There were more chips than the dip. Either way, it was tasty!  Drinks wise we tried the spiked decaf coffee with whipped cream; I expected it to be hot and it was a little cooler, probably from the cool whipped cream. I was offered an extra side of whipped cream because it was good despite the temperature.   Crowd wise, it was always busy. They do not accept reservations, so prepare to wait or hope to get seats at the bar"}
{"text":"Very Madison.  If you're from out of town you have to stop here!  Whether it is just for drinks or for food, you will not be disappointed.  The food is simple and not complicated.  The staff is friendly.  Cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here and suggest a visit for something \"different\" in a good way.It was a cozy atmosphere with a lot of people but it was fun. Food was great, quick service. The place was full the few times I've been here and we've had to wait but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch. Was immediately struck by the decor of the place, especially a painting of what looked to be a hipster Draco Malfoy. Ordered the steak and eggs, which was pretty solid. Flank steak, so nothing spectacular, but mine was cooked a perfect medium-rare, and was seasoned perfectly. Also came with toast and a fig preserve jam, which was great as well. Pico de gallo too, always a plus. Definitely plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I sure wish I'd come hungry....in any event, with the 87 degree temps yesterday, I was powerfully THIRSTY. Since I'd started with vodka earlier, I asked the bartender to surprise me with a big vodka drink to quench my thirst. She came back with a vodka Tom Collins, with muddled lemons in the bottom of the glass, and it was fabulous! I have a new summer cocktail, and here's the best part: $3.50 each! I told her she must've undercharged me, with a $7 tab, but she said that was the price for bar vodka.   I will definitely be back and hopefully try that Walleye sandwich and potatoes that Heather T. raves about."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome atmosphere. I've never had a bad experience with the wait staff. Occasionally it gets busy and it takes a little longer but that's to be expected. I love this place."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese was great, but the Hungarian Ghoulash is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"This place should also be listed under \"Night Life\" category. I stopped by here with my friend for a beer. I liked the board game selections - I can definitely come here again just play some games while getting buzzed.   The cool part is their beer selection. Thank YOU for having Lake Louis beers on the menu. I don't always see Lake Louis scotch ale (my favorite) at every bar in Madison, so kudos to Weary Traveler for having the solid standard for what beer to serve.   Good atmosphere, but I don't know how attentive the servers are .... . I'd love to try their food next time around."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot to get a great meal and a delicious brew. Their Rueben was great, but what really did it for me was the bacon potato salad. Definitely a place to check out if you're from out-of-town."}
{"text":"Yum! My favorites are the Walleye sandwich or the Ruben. Good beer and wine list. Have been coming here for many years and its always good. Service can be a bit slow when the place is packed."}
{"text":"Yes, it's hard to figure out who to talk to in order to get a table on a busy night. Yes, it's an uncomfortable wait. Yes, the tables are uncomfortably close. Yes, the waitstaff is stretched thin and very busy. Yes, there can be a long wait for your food. . BUT! The entrees and soups are AMAZING! I love the veggie West of the Andes Sandwich. The Tom Ka Tofu is very good too. The appetizers are just ok (but I still order them).  We've had good luck getting a table and food quickly on weekday nights."}
{"text":"Arriving early for dinner with a friend from out of town, I sat at the bar and enjoyed a somewhat obscure local beer that was absolutely outstanding. Like many others, I'm in love with the interior of the place. Homey, quaint, cozy, filled with antiquities, it's awesome.   Not so awesome is how cold it was inside, on the coldest night of the winter so far. The curtain that separates the entrance from the entry door isn't very effective at keeping the icy blasts at bay. Maybe add another curtain? Luckily most of the year this shouldn't be a big issue.  My friend arrived and we moved to a table. We'd both checked out the menu online so we knew what we wanted, but the service was very, very, very slow. There was some kind of issue going on in the kitchen and our waitress was clearly frazzled by it. I felt bad because my friend was very hungry after traveling all day. We were seated at around 5:30 and it was after 8 when we left. I'm going to estimate it took over an hour to receive our dinner. My friend loved her warming, flavorful beef goulash, and my sandwich, a cubano type, was delicious. Two things, though. The housemade potato bread it was served on was very good, tender and pillowy, but there was way too much of it compared to the (top notch, locally sourced, flavorful) ingredients inside. It was also cold.   I'll go back for the vibrant, evocative-of-another-time ambiance, the delicious pro-locavore offerings, but I'll go earlier than when I expect to be actually hungry. And I'll dress more warmly."}
{"text":"This place tops our list for lunch dates or date nights!  We love the beer selection and local ingredients- Something we always look for when selecting a place to support! We are always so impressed with the menu and the staff is very friendly.  You really can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is amazing, the atmosphere is homey, and I love looking at all the old musical instruments on the walls while I eat.   I particularly recommend the West of the Andes or the Carne Asada plate."}
{"text":"Great burger, good vibe, great service. Really the Bobs Bad Breath burger is one of the best I've ever had. Perfectly cooked beef patty, carmelized onions, tomato and yummy cheese. Even the bun is awesome. It came with garlic sliced potatoes and a mixed green side salad but who even noticed next to the burger."}
{"text":"As I walked in I decided that I was going to like this place.  Cool place in the cool part of Madison.....   But unfortunately I can't say I loved it.  The Bloody Mary's were top notch.  Filled with a great assortment of vegetables and a beer chaser.... Great start.   The food unfortunately was a let down.  I had the Reuben which was okay and the sides that come with it where good.  Nothing that really great.  I read all the \"bad breath burger\" reviews on yelp (mostly good).  We ordered one and no one liked it.  First of all it was very dry and I just couldn't get into the flavors.  Garlic and cream cheese?  It just wasn't for me.  I liked the vibe of the place and the drinks...  A big not sure on the food."}
{"text":"It was difficult to find the front door... well there were a couple of front doors but I struggled to find the right one. Once in the lunch crowd had yet to materialize so I had free range to pick a seat. The bar was open and had the best vantage point for taking it all in. There is a amazing amount of eclectic memories on the walls everywhere. After an exceedingly long period, I finally got my chicken order and subbed a salad for the potatoes. The chicken must be organic and healthy for me by the size of it but for me i prefer by chicken to be hopped up on hormones and spilling off the plate. The skin was nice and crispy and the breast was a little dry. The green beans were nice and fresh as was the salad. With so many other better options, I don't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Bob's bad breath burger... check it out. You won't be disappointed. ;)"}
{"text":"I still vividly fantasize about the goulash at this place.  We were (whoaaa) LITERALLY weary travelers who, assisted by yelp searching, stopped here for dinner after days of driving east on 90, and the goulash was basically like breast milk: warm, comforting, perfect, seemingly tailor-made for my exact needs, and something I will probably never be able to revisit.  My standards and will to live after a week in the car may have been compromised, but damn did this hit the spot.  My dad got the Bad Breath Burger (and yes, the beef is rosy, fresh, house-ground organic Wisconsin beef, so go as rare as you dare) and my sister got a sandwich that I think was fairly inauthentically branded as \"Andean\" but which was still outstanding.  The interior smacks of generic rustic gastropub in the best way possible, and I recall our waiter being very affable, despite the place being totally swamped on a weekend night."}
{"text":"Surprise, surprise...right?  Here's a list of why Weary gets 4 stars:  1)  It's a fun place to go to.  I almost always end up having a fun conversation with the bartender or my server.  There does seem to be a new guy serving there now who is kind of weird.  I can't say for certain though because he didn't serve me.  2)  The atmosphere is eclectic to the extreme.  Every time I go I find something else on display, and I find myself wondering if it was there before.  \"How could I have missed THAT!?\", I ask myself.  3)  The food.  Bob's burger is as unique a burger as you'll find in Madison...and it tastes great.  The potatoes that come with it are usually done VERY well and are, to me, more delicious than anything there.  The small side salad is simple and tasty.  I've also eaten the meat and cheese platter.  I ordered that on my own, and I'm pretty sure I ordered the medium.  When it showed up, I knew I should have ordered the small.  HUGE is how I can best describe this plate.  Oh, and it's good too.  I've had a special here and there, and they're always good.  I've really never been disappointed by the food.  4)  The beer.  Ok, the selection is limited.  They have Two-Hearted on tap though, and that's good enough for me since it's the best (?) IPA ever made.  5)  The location.  I like it because it's close to home.  There are other restaurants that are closer though, and I have never gone to them (or never gone back)."}
{"text":"best place to teach someone how to play yahtzee and get wasted."}
{"text":"Call me nostalgic. Call me stupid. I'm still trying to figure out why we came back here for dinner after so many bad experiences. If you come for the drinks and atmosphere, then good on ya - probably a satisfactory venue. But they lost their groove on the food.  For at least the past 3 or 4 times, the potatoes are served cold. Just plain cold. The infamous Bob's Bad Breath burger and the walleye sandwich were also cold. The service wasn't slow, but the place was busy. When notified of the problem the waitress was kind enough to replace our cold potatoes with fresh, hot ones, and was very pleasant and polite about it. But don't serve me cold food in the first place. We decided after tonight's experience we would have rather gone hungry than spend $35 on meals + one beer each for the two of us. Madison, what gives? Why aren't we holding Bob to higher standards? Disappointed in this neighborhood venue. Used to be such a destination and now it's one to avoid."}
{"text":"The menu is \"hipster eclectic\" if that makes sense, which is their overall theme.  The ambiance compliments the menu. We tried the coconut Thai curry soup which was very flavorful and delish, both the cups & bowls are Hefty portions which is reflected in the price. The soup does have rather large chunks of vegetables so be 'weary' of that. Steak sandwich also quite flavorful, good bread and pico.  As long as you can find something in the menu to your liking, The Weary Traveler is a great lunch or dinner spot!"}
{"text":"We rode our bikes a half century and decided to reward ourselves with Bob's Bad Breath Burger! We came in around 5:30 on a Friday night... not very busy yet, so we took a seat and when the waiter came, we ordered two brandy old fashioned and asked for a few minutes to wash our hands and check out the menu.  The waiter came back in a timely manner and my friend said she was ready to order and ordered the BBB with no caramelized onions with extra greens on the side and the House chips that come with it.  I was going to get the exact same but when I asked the waiter what all came ON the burger since my friend didn't want onions- his reply was \"you can read it in the menu\" - EXCUSE ME? Yes I can but when a paying customer asks a question about the menu items it's customary and good practice to answer them straight away instead of using snarky responses.  Needless to say the waiter soured my experience and I doubt I'll return to a establishment that doesn't value my business!  The BOBS BAD BREATH BURGER was ok but not worth being treated rudely; too may other good burgers in Madison to put up with this."}
{"text":"Ate a nice dinner here and would highly recommend. There was immediate seating around 6 on a Saturday over the summer. I got the carne asada plate and it was so fresh and delicious. I would go back to try the other yummy looking things on the menu for sure. It looked like they used local and fresh ingredients and had fantastic offerings. Service was also great as well."}
{"text":"I wish I could have given this zero stars. My co-workers and I went into the Weary Traveler the other day for lunch - none of us have ever been there but we all heard relatively good things of the place.   When we first entered, the initial shock was how cold the place was. I know that we were going through the midst of the Polar Vortex this week, but seriously there was very little difference in temperature from outside to inside.   The service was average at best, nothing to write home about except that our server appeared to be very disheveled and possibly might have missed a shower or two.. or three....  Our food arrived, again nothing spectacular.   But that is where the fun begins... The next day when we all got to the office and reviewed the lunch from the day prior we all began to realize that each of us had come down with some sort of illness. None of us were sick the previous day (or the previous month). The only thing that we can attribute our illness to is this place.   All I know that is after going through 48 hours of a fever mixed in with severe nausea and a horrible cough, this place is not  worth EVER eating again."}
{"text":"The menu was creative.  Some of the plates we saw coming out of the kitchen looked pretty good. I would have liked to see real field greens in my plate instead of a bagged mix.  The sandwich I ordered didn't fill the bun which was a disappointment.  It doesn't take much to throw a little extra meat and vegetables in a sandwich (steak). My partner's reuben was OK.  Again, add a little more meat.  The craft beer selection could use a little more local flavor with all the great choices in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Great drink selection. Good place to eat if you're vegetarian/vegan, because they have plenty of options for you. The service was a little slow while we were there, but it was a busy night."}
{"text":"This place has a seriously cozy vibe with eclectic decor and great food. The menu is small but varies from vegan chili to elk burgers, goulash or Thai seasoned tofu. It is a favorite place to bring a small group with varied taste when people come to town. The hot drinks after dinner are a nice touch for Wisconsin. I recommend the Mexican sampler for a shared appetizer. The pickled veggies are excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great east side laidback ambience. Healthy food and great beer selection. I had their Seasonal Superfood Salad and it was delicious. Creamy goat cheese and roasted Brussel sprouts and squash on mixed greens. Sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  A bit of a wait for a table, no problem, waited at the bar.  It was VERY busy though, service was pretty attentive so, it was fine.  Seating is a little cramped and it's definitely a \"buzzing\" place....lots of background chatter from other diners, etc.  The decor is quite cool.  Food was very good.  We tried the pork chop over greens and the fried chicken.  Both were cooked very nicely.  I asked for my chop medium rare, and it actually was medium rare.  For some reason....it seems like so many places will only cook chops to medium well or well....wtf is the point of buying a good chop if you're going to turn it into shoe leather?  please!  So, yes...definitely pleased with the food and will be back, for sure!  Hint:  Parking can be a little tough...just plan on parking on a side street and walking a block or two...."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and go to weary traveler probably once every 2 weeks. I love the decor and the chicken diijonaise and the bad breath burger. Good wine and beer as well. This is probably the best value meal in Madison for good quality food. My one complaint is that we've waited a ridiculous amount of time for food before with no explanation at all. I can wait 45 minutes if I've been warned and the food comes out hot but it's hard to grin and bear it after 40 minutes or more and the food comes out cold. I think WT might have an issue with staff scheduling. The good food and atmosphere will keep me coming back for now though."}
{"text":"I'm not a big 5 star guy... but The Weary Traveler really does itself well.  You could always find an issue to pick something apart... so let's list those out now: figuring out where to sit if you're new to the place, the music that some of the bartenders play too loud, the one meal that I didn't like, and... um... okay, done.  Now, for what's good.  This place doesn't even have a deep fryer.  When it comes to the food, they take their time, they put it together well, and they use exceptional ingredients.  The West of the Andes sandwich, the Chili (with meat), the Tom Ka Tofu, are all favorites of mine.  I also like the Carne Asada, because the plate comes with great pickled veggies, fresh guacamole, nicely spiced sirloin, and a whole bunch of chips.  Cut up that meat, mix the pieces together, and you've got a killer dip for dinner... go ahead, try it, you'll like it... I promise.  In other news, the bartenders are friendly but generally not up for much conversation.  The place is just as good for a couple of drinks as it is for dinner, and they have some great larger tables for some friends to get together and take advantage of their extensive board games collection in the back corner.  It is also open late and serves dinner until 1am... which is a major plus as Madison tends to shut down much earlier.  A local, cozy, affordable, quality, friendly bar/restaurant that never disappoints... 5 of 5."}
{"text":"I'm a visitor from out of town, visiting my family. Looking for a great place to eat with a great atmosphere. I thought it was the weary traveler. Unfortunately I find myself a weary traveler, as I sit in this establishment. Our waitress seems very angry. We walked in and we must have done something wrong? Unfortunately we are only having a drink and leaving. We will walk across the street to and find somewhere else to eat.   Edit: we ended up going to Bunkies. We called ahead to see when they opened and they opened an hour early for us. They were super friendly and the food was great."}
{"text":"Great bar with great food. Great atmosphere with everyone from students to long term residents of the area. Small menu but super high quality. Only downfall is parking but worth the walk."}
{"text":"I am finally comfortable saying that The Weary Traveler has the best burger in Madison.  It took a lot of eating, but after 3 visits to the WT, and trial and error at other restaurants, I know Bob's Bad Breath Burger is unbeatable!  Always juicy and perfectly cooked, the toppings go wonderfully together, and it's pretty big.  Yes, you will literally be able to taste your breath afterwards, so I suggest having your date order the same burger!"}
{"text":"Always great food and a lot of variety for vegetarians. A few of the waiters/waitresses can be a bit stuck up, I ordered a very peculiar tasting margarita (it tasted like salty water) and when I asked them to take it back (I don't usually do this), I was told that there's nothing wrong with how it was made. I felt the comment was unnecessary. However, I'm always very pleased with the food."}
{"text":"Mmm, I always have a good meal when I come to the Weary Traveler. However, I have to say, I think it's over-rated.  I've been about 3-4 times since living just 2 blocks away. I've tried the Andes sandwich, both with tuna and pork. Pretty tasty. I had a grilled cheese last time, which came out luke warm and was sort of dry. I asked the waitress to bring a sauce to give the sandwich some spunk. She brought the goddess sauce, which was yummy. I do love the side of mixed greens with vinaigrette.   I think the Weary Traveler could add a few things to the menu, or at least have seasonal specials. They do have a decent beer selection and I like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, good food, fine service.  Tap menu could be more impressive.  Have enjoyed the bad breath burger and the west Andes sandwich. Recommend trying their kambucha and vodka."}
{"text":"Snotty, pretentious servers, CRAPPY service, loud, obnoxious hipsters, and the sexxay-acting, stuck-up waitress hit on my friend (even going so far as to sit in his lap, eww!), thinking he was paying the tab and shit? Well, I was paying the tab. Oops. I don't care how good the food, is- bad service is a deal breaker for me. Ugh."}
{"text":"The Weary is always a go-to for me when I have visitors come to Madison. The environment is warm and fairly intimate and the menu is small, but great. I usually get the Tom Kha Tofu, which I could eat every day and not get sick of it. The kombucha cocktails are interesting and worth a try. I would recommend coming here off peak hours though, because sometimes there is a wait."}
{"text":"This place has it all for me. The atmosphere is relaxing and welcoming, the food is delicious and locally sourced, their kitchen stays open late, and it is within walking distance from my house. I recommend the West of the Andes sandwich. The servers are friendly and the bartenders have been nothing but polite and happy to chat about the beer on tap or their favorite cocktails.  It can get packed on the weekends during dinner so plan on getting there early if you are with a large group. Parking can be challenging on the weekends too."}
{"text":"This weary traveler loves finding a nice spot for lunch while on the road.  My husband and I were on our way to LaCrosse for a wedding with some time built in for lunch.  We were close to Madison twoish on Saturday and I started checking out places on Yelp.  This one was open and seemed to be just the right spot for a late lunch.  It was a great choice, thanks Yelp and specifically Molly O.!  I liked the whole feel of the place from the heavy wooden tables to the phones repurposed as lamps.  I sortof wanted one but they weren't for sale!  There was only one other table when we were there and I appreciated them clearing out the place for us!   Our server was quick and efficient and helped us get a nice lunch and on our way.  I had the West of the Andes sandwich with the beef tenderloin.  Melt in your mouth wonderfulness!  I loved the avocado plus the slight kick from the chipotle mayonnaise.  Pair it with a glass of iced tea and I was happy we had stopped.  To get off the highway, have a civilized tasty meal and get back on the highway took maybe an hour but hey, we needed gas also, a twofer!  I suggest you do the same while traveling, use Yelp to make your meals a cut above burgers on the side of the road.  And if you are near Madison, come rest and have a repast at the Weary Traveler!"}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood spot.  Comforting, warm, yummy. The walleye sandwich is the best."}
{"text":"Great brunch menu and bloody mary's."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great beer selection, great food! The chili is mad tasty. The beer selection is large and rotating with lots of local stuff. This is a farm to table type place so they serve it up tasty.  Give it a shot of your feet lead you here."}
{"text":"So I just found out the Weary Traveler has a Brunch.  I was meeting a friend and he suggested them.  I got there around 1 pm and I easily found a seat. My companion was late and the server checked on me several times to see if I needed anything while I waited.  I did end up ordered a Celtic coffee.  This lovely coffee is sweet and stinging with the Irish cream, whiskey, and fresh whipped cream.  I would get that again.  This funky spot looks like an adult version of Ella's Deli.  While I waited for my friend, I enjoyed looking around at the telephone lamps and the wall decorations.  The door you walk through to get to the dining/bar area is a gorgeous wood design.   When my pal did arrive, we ordered.  I had the French toast with a side of sausage.  The sourdough bread was large and yummy.  The sausage was a different texture than I was used, too.  Next time, I would try the bacon.  It was a big yummy breakfast, just what I wanted on a Sunday afternoon.  My pal ordered the Walleye Sandwich.  He has had it many times before.  I enjoyed looking at the generously sized sandwich.  The Brunch menu is small on the scale of other restaurants but it is packed full of flavor.  If I wasn't feeling the French toast, I was thinking about the goulash."}
{"text":"I've had a pleasant experience every time I go here. OK, what am I saying? This place kicks butt!!!! The potatoes that come with your meal are to die for! The bad breath burger is awesome, love the name.    It gets quite busy though, so expect a wait around dinner time.  But have a drink at the bar, and enjoy some nice company. Once you get seated, there is a corner in the back FULL of games, so break out some scrabble.   This place is truly a Madison favorite of mine. Delicious food (veggie options). Can't remember how the service was last time, but I've gone back, so it couldn't have been terrible.  Awesome, cozy place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The bobs bad breath burger is a must! Service was friendly,fast, and overall just a wonderful experience. Also, they have a good amount of beers on tap. The prices are a little above average but it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! 5 stars alone for ambiance. Bad breath burger, tilapia sandwich and west andes sandwich are all to die for. Guess you could say Weary Traveler has the best sandwiches in Madison, definitely on Willy. The tom kha soup is also to die for. Small but selective beer selection.   And I can't say enough about the ambiance. A little dark if you wanna go during the day though."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I have only eaten here twice but every time I do I want to go back and eat more immediately after leaving. The staff is always pleasant. They seem genuine and don't \"bother you\" more than checking in - which is exactly what I enjoy. Both experiences were a 5!"}
{"text":"We arrived early around 6pm for dinner and were greeted promptly. We thoroughly enjoyed the South of the border plate as an appetizer. The pickled mix was hot and spicy. Fresh ingredients in the guacamole and pico.  Bob's burger was good and filling. The salmon was tender and moist. The quinoa salad has lots of flavor. Service by the entire staff was exceptional. The vegan chocolate caramel cashew tort finished of a great dining experience in a quaint atmosphere."}
{"text":"For just two of us this place was great and we got seats at the bar immediately. I think  larger parties (5+) could have a tough time getting a table but once they did they wouldn't be disappointed. The carne asada plate was delicious!"}
{"text":"Been there numerous times for the past 10 years. The food and service are consistently good. You get waited on right away and food comes fairly fast, they also serve food late which can be handy if you find yourself hungry at midnight. The ingredients are very fresh and high quality, the cooks know what they're doing. The West of the Andes sandwich never disappoints. The Chicken Dijonnaise with mashed potatoes and green beans and a Dijon Cream sauce is yummy! They also have vegetarian and vegan choices like the grilled vegetables platter (Very good!), Vegan Chili and Baked Stuffed Squash. Waitstaff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere tucked into a cute neighborhood in Madison. The servers are friendly, helpful, and gave good recommendations. I had the Knausgaard Sandwich - Nueske's smoked ham, Carr Valley Gouda & Roth Grand Cru melted on house-made potato bread with whole grain mustard, refrigerator pickles & caramelized onions. Served with cottage cheese and cherry tomatoes. $10.75  Their wine is really cheap - most glasses were under $6. They also have a full bar with lots of yummy-sounding tequila cocktails.  I want to come back on a cold winter day, order the Hungarian Goulash, a dark Porter, and play one of the board games they have available."}
{"text":"The food was so bomb. It really was. Impressive drink menu. Bar has a laid-back \"Cheers\" feel. Bartenders were great but my server was average, which is the only reason this is 4/5 & not 5/5."}
{"text":"Let's face it: we love the Weary Traveler because of the Bad Breath Burger.  The rest of the menu is passable, the service is good enough, the location is alright.  The reason we go to the Weary Traveler is the Bad Breath Burger, simply the best burger in Madison, Wisconsin.  Bun = lightly toasted, just a bit of butter flavor  Meat = organic, flavorful, delicious  Cream cheese = cool, rich counterpoint to burger and bread  Carmelized onions = just the right dose of savory  Green goddess sauce = the piece de resistance  I have to stop because I'm making myself very hungry ..."}
{"text":"Great tavern-style, quirky restaurant with boardgames and a diverse menu. It's got a dark, cute atmosphere with lots of kitch.  The service is friendly and once you order they let you stay as long as you'd like and never make you feel pressured to leave. The only small knock I have is that the service is slow, but that's to be expected of a busy restaurant that lets you dine/drink/schmooze at your own pace."}
{"text":"Weary traveler has the best crowd. Food is great and I love the vegan options!  Th grog will leave you with an absolute hangover that was absolutely deserved! Great spot and highly recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"Excellent in so many ways. The atmosphere is really great, so chill.  The food is basic comfort food . You just can't go wrong w/whatever you order.  Service is really great but you can't be in a hurry. Relax, it's all good!"}
{"text":"Nice place for some good, unique dishes and fun drinks. We came for dinner and started out with the Meat and Cheese platter. It was not at all what I expected, unfortunately. It was basically a deli platter. It had sliced cheese and sliced meat that looked like it could have been from Subway. I wasn't impressed.   For my main course, I went with the Hungarian Goulash and it was delicious. Very flavorful and had nice bread that went with it, to soak up all the broth.   The atmosphere is fun and trendy. Definitely a good spot to stop in for a drink, or for a meal. I will be back."}
{"text":"TIM. Get the beef West of the Andes sammich!"}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler is perfect for a Sunday afternoon or a cozy weekday dinner.   I've been a few times for various occasions, and I definitely like their soups and appetizers best. They have an assortment of games and cards on the shelf, so it's fun to grab a few beers and hang out for a while, but not on a weekend night.   The Tom Ka is really good, as is the hummus platter. I've tried the corn quinoa salad and my friends go crazy over the bad breath burger, to name a few favorite menu options.  I would try it out if you haven't been, but definitely avoid Friday and Saturday nights. They tend to be packed with long waits and sub-par service."}
{"text":"Went here a few times with my boyfriend and man it is always so good. The food is really fresh and I love this spot. It's almost a hidden spot that has local and organic foods from Madison. I love it and the prices are very inexpensive as well."}
{"text":"First time in Wisconsin. Found this bar/restaurant on Yelp and read the good reviews. Me & a coworker decided to try it and it was a home run! Great draft beers, very good food and affordable. Ambiance was very cool - I would recommend to anyone passing through!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here! The environment is very chill/casual and I enjoyed their Bad Breath burger (I got it with no bun) a lot! I usually am bummed out when places serve burgers with chips and not fries - but their homemade chips are seasoned well and have a potato-y taste still. The burger was a slam dunk though - loved the cream cheese on it! Would definitely come back here. As far as cons go, the menu itself is rather limited - I could see it being tricky for some people to find a dish they'd enjoy, and they don't really have traditional appetizers for an American joint. Overall worth trying for the burger!"}
{"text":"I took some out-of-town guests to WT, purely based on the previous reviews here on Yelp and OH MY GOD! This place is great! Granted, it was a loud Friday night, but I was expecting (and even welcoming) that sort of environment. I was absolutely blown away by the food. When I skimmed the prices on the menu (before actually reading the item names), I mistakenly assumed I was looking at an appetizer menu! The prices are rock bottom, and yet the quality and character of the fare was outstanding. I'll be making sure to visit here again.  I'm no hippie, but I did feel at ease with the lack of any TVs in sight of our table and Michael Franti's voice barely audible in the background.  Maybe next time, I'll challenge my dinner guests to a friendly game of connect four -- yep, they've got a rack full of classic board/table/card games for those of us that prefer to interact with our friends while enjoying a pint as opposed to screaming at a sports game on TV.  pure. genius."}
{"text":"I've always had good service at the Weary Traveler. The waitstaff are generally friendly and knowledgeable, and they seem to take a decent amount of pride in doing a good job. I've been there by myself or with fairly large groups, and in all cases I enjoyed myself.  There are a couple items on the menu that make this a must-visit for anyone who can spend a day or two in Madison. The Bob's Bad Breath Burger is a real treat (and worth the hour in the pool I have to spend to work some of it off), and the Walleye Sandwich is without a doubt the best fish sandwich on this planet. It is one of the few walleye sandwiches around that is not breaded. It is broiled to perfection and topped with a tartar sauce-like aioli that complements the flavor of the fish perfectly. It's always nice to have a healthy option that blows everything else on the menu out of the water."}
{"text":"Be sure to get the vegan chill with cornbread. The chili is slightly spicy, but good. The cornbread is awesome, too!"}
{"text":"Really cool, funky place on Willy St. Food and atmosphere are great, service can be spotty at times through.  It is seat yourself and can get confusing at times. They have gotten better at having someone take names on busy nights but years ago it was kinda of a free for all. My husband and I love the board games they have on the back wall. We used to come and play scrabble or yahtzee before our dinner.  The food is awesome here. The bad breath burger is definitely one of the best burgers is Madison. It comes with a side of crispy, sliced garlicky potatoes and a small salad. The burger has caramelized onions, cream cheese among other things. Its delicious! Their Hungarian goulash is really tasty, you can get a cup or a bowl. I've also had their Dijon chicken with mash potatoes also super yummy. The salsa and chip platter  or hummus plate are nice starters too. Pretty much anything you get here will be good."}
{"text":"I've been to the Weary Traveler twice now over the last year, and each experience has left me scratching my head as to why there are so many fans of this place.  If the Traveler has any strong stuff going for it, it's that there is a very pleasant atmosphere and a good location.  Sequestered about a block from the Willy St. Co-op, The Weary Traveler is in one of those neighborhoods that offers almost everything you could want.  Great restaurants, fun bars, unique mom-and-pop stores, and hipster people with generally good attitudes.  The restaurant itself has a nice ambiance that promotes relaxation and talk with friends, and the staff is impeccably polite.  All that said, I've had some issues with the place.  First, their menu is ridiculously limited.  You're handed a sheet of paper with about a dozen options on it including the appetizers, and a lot of the items are basically the same thing.  Case in point, - Bad Breath Burger, Ace Burger, Carne Asada, etc.  Chicken Breast with vegetables, Grill Cheese, Rueben.  While each dish is written about as if it's something magnificent, to me it was just hard to buy into the ingenuity.  Between myself and several friends I've now seen the majority of the dishes offered and had a taste, and I simply wasn't impressed.  The burger was tasty, but not the best I've had, all of the meat was red and a choice was never given on that (even though I tend to like more rare food, this both times was questionably so).  Portion sizes also varied; some were incredibly huge, others left one wanting to attend a second restaurant.  I do applaud them for a little originality with the sides.  Instead of the typical \"burger and fries,\" my burger had carrots and graham crackers.  If anything, this was my favorite part of that particular meal as I almost always want more vegetables when eating out then what's offered and the crackers were yum-tastic.  Both times I went, the wait time for getting our meal was horribly long.  The first time, there was just about no one in the restaurant, but we still sat there for 45 minutes with maybe one peek-in from our waitress to make sure our drink glasses were filled.  The second time, not only did that same behavior occur, but on top of it we had a 40 minute wait just to be seated because it was so crowded you couldn't even move.  Now I'll be the first man to say it's absolutely worth the wait at a good restaurant, but that's just it; I wasn't impressed.  Perhaps I'm being too harsh on the poor old Traveler, but when I'm yelping I try to put up more reviews for places that I could strongly recommend people to go.  And with all the other fantastic options on Willy Street, this is certainly not a spot I'd recommend going."}
{"text":"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary....suddenly there came...burgers!   And really good burgers.  As we all know, ya just gotsa get the Bob's Bad Breath Burger. Cream cheese, green goddess dressing, caramelized onions, garlic, tomato, pickapeppa sauce. It's messy. It's goooood.   Similarly delicious is their West of the Andes beef tenderloin sandwich with avocado, pico de gallo, and chipotle mayo. If you're into that sorta thang.  We also tried the Carne Asada of marinated flank steak, guacamole, pico de gallo, grilled scallion, tortilla chips, and spicy escabeche pickled vegetables. The steak was glorious.   I love their Japanese sukara cherry green tea by the way."}
{"text":"Ah, my old stomping grounds. Used to go here all the time to see my friend's bluegrass band. I love the food: med plate is great although short on pita, the burger is heavenly but will in fact make your breath smell like hell, the porkchops are worth the price, and the tom ka tofu soup's a killer. The thing I can't forgive though is that they got rid of the Sunday brunch. They had the most amazing almond buttermilk pancakes that were all-you-can-eat. Why oh why did that end? Moving on, this was often the place that I started my nights, and then ended up staying and ending them there as well. And was never worse off for it."}
{"text":"Try the Walleye sandwich.  It's what brought me there and it's what keeps me coming back.  Also try the vegetarian chili.  Out of sight!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. As nerdy as this will sound it did make me feel like I was dining in some old inn before my voyage to find a ring and/or horcrux. The lighting is very dim which I liked. I ordered the salad with black beans, corn, avocado, and steak. Food was seasoned well and tasted amazing. I tried the kombucha and vodka drink which was also amazing. I also had some Thai soup. It wasn't bad but it felt a bit thin. Maybe rice on the side would've helped it feel more like a meal? Still would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Big fan of the Weary.  Good food at a very nice price.  Full bar and good selection of beer.  The only downside is there is usually a wait.  I am a fan of the Carne Asada, the Chicken Dijonaise, and the West of the Andes Sandwich.  I would like to try more but I always keep coming back for those dishes."}
{"text":"I don't really know how to describe the best piece of roasted chicken in my life?  It was just perfect.  A perfectly seasoned chicken breast with garlic potatoes and green beans that I am still craving even a week later.  I did have some issues with this restaurant however.  There wasn't much of a variety to choose from and the prices I felt were a little high.  I am sure one is paying for location given where the restaurant is located, but I would like to see more choice in the future."}
{"text":"The Weary Traveler Free House is a cozy little tavern in the Willy St. neighborhood on the East side of town.  Bar food that tastes like it's been made with some care.  Bob's Bad Breath Burger and the West of the Andes sandwich are always big hits.  Fantastic selection of beer on tap (Lake Louie and Great Dane are two highlights) and solid bartenders.  Can sometimes be a victim of its own success; Friday and Saturday nights can be really crowded and you're always standing in the way of the waitstaff."}
{"text":"FOOD/DRINKS: The food here is very good. A few of my favorites are the West of the Andes sandwich, Bob's Bad Breath Burger, and Hungarian Goulash. I like that they have things you don't see everywhere else like kombucha with vodka!  AMBIANCE: It has a dark, cozy, intimate vibe. It can get pretty loud. Best enjoyed with one other person or a small group. The tables are pretty small.  SERVICE: I've always had friendly service, but sometimes it's a bit slow. It depends how busy the restaurant is. It's better to go on a Sunday afternoon or at least to avoid peak times when it gets really busy."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this spot while on a work trip in Madison, and now I dream of their Tom Ka soup.  I rolled in solo as a real-life weary traveler and people watched for a good three hours from a corner table.   From an observers point of view, it seemed like this was the kind of place you went to for the whole night. It's not the spot you go to for a quick bite or beer. Nearly everyone who came in settled in for the long haul. There were lots of board games and books lying around that you could bring to your table, and the seating was crowded enough to make inter-table mingling a very easy task.  This is definitely the kind of place I would frequent if I lived here.   And again, the Tom Ka soup ruined me. Nowhere else I've been has beat it since, even some of my favorite Thai places."}
{"text":"Great decor, great service, Great homemade food using local ingredients!"}
{"text":"The Goulash, the salads, the sandwiches: there's a reason this place has a line on weekends and Friday nights!  If you're looking for a great atmosphere and good filling food, this place is for you. Don't get discouraged by the Willy Street parking, this place is worth walking too."}
{"text":"I went here again with my girlfriend recently and we were sadly disappointed. I'm hoping it was an \"off\" night.   We started off with a chips and guac sampler that was delicious, although really, its hard to screw that up. We then moved onto main courses and it was here that the meal went awry.   I had a bowl of the chili which was just not...good. The flavor seemed off, and with way too much chopped onion. It felt as if I was eating a dish of chopped onion in vaguely chili-flavored tomato juice. The cornbread was dry as well. My girlfriend, the meat eater, got meat in hers and described it as \"stringy\"--odd for tenderloin tips, I think.   I also had a salad, which while good, wasn't as good as I remembered last time. The avocados were not quite ripe, which gave it a totally different texture.   Last but not least, our nearly sixty-dollar tab (including beer) for okay chili, salad, and chips seemed...excessive? We felt like we got ripped off, not a great feeling for a date night. I would eat here again, but now I'm worried about consistency so it might be a while."}
{"text":"FINALLY CHRIS B. HAS COME BACK TO THE WEARY!    And you know something, jabroni?  It's been 6 long years, but the Weary still laid the smack down all over our family table.  And no, Chris B. wasn't in the mood for pie.  He was in the mood to have the best guaran-damn-teed late-night culinary extravaganza on the east side of Madison!  Let's start with the West of the Andes sandwich.  This is a sandwich that will make you shut your mouth and know your role, which is to enjoy the delicious tangy salsa, fresh greens, and perfectly spicy chipotle sauce.  Mmm... Last time Chris B.  was here he had it with roasted veggies, however, since that time he joined the millions... and millions of seafood fans, and had it with tuna steak.    You say you can't find spicy food in Madison?  You say that most places won't just bring it?  Well Chris B. says you should check your roody-poo candy-ass directly into the Weary Traveler, at the corner of Know Your Role Boulevard and Jabroni Drive (actually Williamson and Few), and go one-on-one with the Great One: The Weary Traveler's Tom Kha Tofu soup.  Oh, and that reminds Chris B.  What's your favorite beer?  IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR FAVORITE BEER IS!    Because when you go step into the squared circle and go toe-to-toe with the beer selection of the-most-electrifying-late-night-eastside-Madison-cafe, you'll find only the finest Wisconsin beers for the perfect matchup.  Now Chris B. knows that some say that Schlitz is what made Milwaukee's monkey ass famous.  Well Chris B. says that for his meal he chose Tommy's Porter, brewed by Lake Louie out of Arena, Wisconsin, an appropriate location for a brewery that LAYETH THE SMACKETH DOWN with every bottle!  Only one question remains then, jabroni.  Do you smell what the Weary is cookin?!"}
{"text":"Extremely happy!!! They know how to make a proper Manhattan! Very accommodating. Great atmosphere and great service. Would love to keep drinking here in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. I love the Madison staple of the mixed salad as the side, and everything was cooked to perfection. I will definitely come back during my travels."}
{"text":"Hot Butter Rum!  That was my drink & it was wonderful!   (Here endth the review!0"}
{"text":"Weary Traveler is not perfect, but may well be as perfect as you can get this side of Eden.  There's all sorts of quirky art hanging on the walls and out of commission instruments.  The staff is just about at hipster-lovely-awesome as you can get.  And the menu is (despite being short...and it is short) thoughtfully put together and constructed from locally sourced (when possible) high-quality items.  The whole space as a feeling of shabby-chic that automatically endears itself to me.  The atmosphere is dark and intimate, but the place is usually pretty full, so be prepared to wait  (P.S.Just have a beer and get over it!)  A last word of praise: Tonight we ordered the chicken, which when got appeared under cooked, so we asked the waitress to take it back, which she did.  When she brought it back out, it was amazing and they had doubled a our side items, which also tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Been here twice, and would probably come back if I were in the area and needed something reliable. I had the West of the Andes sandwich (with tuna) once, which was really good. Can't go wrong with avocado, tuna and chipotle mayo. The other time, I had the chili, but don't remember what it was like. I also had a really unique hot tea, but don't remember what it was called.... apologies for my poor memory.   This place has a pretty hipster vibe, and is really laid back. We hung out there for a few hours without the waiter bothering us, which was nice. It's the kind of place where you could kick it with friends for a few hours and not spend a ton of money.   It was pretty easy to find parking on Willy Street, and I didn't have to wait either time I came here."}
{"text":"Fun place, good vegan options. Great drinks. Their vegan chili is excellent."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Weary. I have been coming here for years and each visit has been great.   The bartenders and staff have always been nice and attentive. The food is wonderful. The ambiance is great. There's really nothing to complain about here.   I brought a friend in just the other day. She had never been so I was curious to see what she thought. She loved it! (I knew she would ;))   The menu isn't huge, but it has something for everyone. Another nice thing about Weary is that they have a lot of vegetarian options for the veggies who come in. I ordered chili last time I was there and they always ask if you want it with or without meat. It's nice they do that."}
{"text":"I don't care if you're on a first date, a vampire, or some kindof strange gum or deodorant professional whose job it is to smell good all the time, you order the Bad Breath Burger because it is the most garlicy-cheesy-delicious piece of cow you will ever have.  I miss this place so much and tell everyone I know to go there for the burger alone, but everything else on the menu is terrific as well."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night.  We had the bad breath burger, and the walleye sammy.  Both were pretty good, but not like \"wow, I'll be craving this now\"."}
