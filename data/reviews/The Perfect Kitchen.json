{"text":"My family came to stay and loved this place so much we ended up eating there 3 nights out of the 5. All round great place. Excellent family style setting and dishes.

If you're looking for Americanized Chinese food, this isn't the place for you. Dishes are authentic and sized to share.

Shrimp with broccoli and ginger beef were our two favorites"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food in Mississauga. Dim sum was nice but rice noodles were a bit lacking in sauce. Price is also a bit expensive but I'm used to Scarborough and markham prices which tend to be cheaper due to competition. Service was good.  Overall, good place if you are craving Chinese food but nothing stellar."}
{"text":"It's been a while, but we decided to re-visit Perfect Kitchen for dim sum earlier today. (Recently, our go-to has been Summit Garden.)

This restaurant is quite small and it can be crowded depending on the time of day. We didn't go out for lunch until 2 o'clock today, so I wasn't surprised that there was no wait.

What I love about Perfect Kitchen is the fact that their dim sum dishes are made-to-order. In other words, you won't ever receive a dish that may have been sitting on a cart for so long that it has become cold and stale. Everything comes steaming hot and crispy. However, it was quite a bit of a wait before our food started to come one after another... 

The one dim sum dish that really stood out was the deep-fried egg yolk cream (custard) buns. Small buns, but what a generous amount of filling! They were so delicious that we had to get a second order...for our table of four. ;)

Compared to other dim sum restaurants in Mississauga, we felt Perfect Kitchen's portions were smaller, particularly their siu mai, buns, XO sauce pan-fried rice rolls, and custard sponge cake rolls. It can also be a bit pricier than usual, but having everything made-to-order makes a big difference."}
{"text":"very poor service. recently went here, we were a party of 9 including two babies under 1 and a toddler... gave us a number so we waited. a minute after a party of 8 came in and they were seated immediately. 10 minutes after a party of 5 were seated and 20 minutes after a newly arrived party of 7 were seated immediately. the owner just passed us as if we weren't there waiting. got so pissed off so we just left. heck i don't care if the food is good. their customer service is really really bad. i wouldn't even give this restaurant a star if there is an option."}
{"text":"Amazing food, came for lunch. Good service and one of the best sweet and sour chicken I've had."}
{"text":"I got not idea, what is going on over here. So many people gave the good name on the Perfect Kitchen .  It is insane .  The foods just OK. Comparing the most chinese reataurant , it is nothing. Sorry , I am so sorry that the people here are ruining Chinese Dim sum. I am really crying for the cook better not become a cook:(:(:( Please do something else."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has such good reviews.  Everything was just mediocre, the service, the food, the whole place. The chicken is not real meat chicken, we got the \"shredded\" chicken fried rice and the rice wasn't fried and the chicken was like rubbery noodles, same with my sweet and sour chicken - the flavor was ok but the texture is weird."}
{"text":"Do not recommend. Waited about an hour for a handful of rice. According to the menu, expected waiting time is approx 25 mins. We waited 50 mins before we asked and the waiter said, \"when you order these, you might as well drive to scarborough and back before it's about time.\" I know they don't actually have a real dim sum chef, they buy it and prepare it from the frozen packages. I buy better tasting frozen dim sum out in scarborough than they buy. Their dim sum is powdery and falls apart before it makes it to my mouth."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some authentic Cantonese style Chinese food, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"As soon as we sat down they brought over tea, and later on we found out that they charged us $1 for tea per person. It would be nice if they let us know that in advance, I don't mind paying. The food was alright, not too greasy or salty but nothing we ordered was exceptional that we need to come back for.  We ordered congee, pork dumplings, calamari and fish bean curd rolls. We would come back in the future to try other items on the menu if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Was here for the first time for dinner and like other reviews,  the food was great.  We had sweet and sour pork,  the grouper with corn sauce and the serving was very generous.  The service was better than my expectations.  They wrapped up the left overs without even asking.  

Definitely will come back.  One of a few Chinese restaurants near Oakville and definitely a good one."}
{"text":"As far as Chinese Restaurants go, this is one of the good ones I could find in Oakville/Mississauga. Authentic food, but a bit on the pricier side. I would say the restaurant cleanliness is above par from other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"This is restaurant is amazing! Authentic Chinese food with great service and friendly staff. We have been going there for the past 5 years. They even switched ingredient to fit our taste. We could not ask for more!"}
{"text":"Go to take out with a friend and surprisingly the food is not oily and the taste is pretty good.  We order a number of dishes and every dish turns out to be good.

Found a gem in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant based on the reviews.  Service is friendly and good is solid good quality Cantonese style.  Will be back"}
{"text":"I agree with the one star ratings below. The food is adequate, but the way they run this place is like a scam from start to finish. 

Everything is ridiculously expensive to start with, then they charge for everything they can think of. 

Surprised there isn't a napkin or chopstick fee. Maybe you have to pay for toilets next. That would be smart of them. 

Watch your wallets y'all!

I'd rather go to the legit restaurants in Mississauga creditview/central Pkwy area."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey for your typical Chinese food. Portion size kind of small. 13$ for 6 spring rolls...not worth the price. Heard their dim sum is good? Don't know if I'd be coming back for dinner. Staff were extremely nice however."}
{"text":"We were introduced to The Perfect Kitchen by a Chinese friend! This is a wonderful family run restaurant with tasty dishes and friendly service."}
{"text":"we got here and dimsum had ended, they were nice enough to bring out an item for us from dimsum menu, value wise its a meh, flavour was just ok
nothing to rave about"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant! 

I moved into the area about a month ago and since then I've eaten here 4 times. I've tried several of their dinner dishes including:
* The half deep fried chicken - probably the best I've had. The chicken is extremely well made (not dry at all) and even the shrimp chips, which I usually dislike, taste delicious. 

* Rice noodles with black bean sauce - delicious, well portioned and rice noodles are fresh 

* spicy deep fried pork chops &  spicy deep fried beef - this is he first Chinese restaurant I've ever tried with a beef version of this dish. It was the best thing I've ever eaten in my life. Extremely tender and well seasoned beef. Pork chop version is also awesome. 

* Garlic sauce choy - I normally dislike vegetables. But they make really tasty choy 

* Hot and sour soup -  this is probably the one dish I did not like. It was a really bland soup. 

* a bunch of dim sum dishes - much better than the other local Chinese joint that offers dim sum.. Though their dim sum  menu seems a bit limited.

If you go there for dinner, they also typically give you a free soup which changes all the time. Their free soups are delicious. They also give you a free bean dessert at the end of dinner. 

Service is pretty good and the atmosphere is nice. Price wise, it's not as cheap as some of the places you'd find in Markham but I think the food here is worth it! 

Overall, I'd say this is an excellent Chinese restaurant. The only thing I wish is that they had some more items on the menu (if they made duck I'd never go elsewhere). But besides that, what they do, they do amazingly well! Looking for a Chinese restaurant in the area? This is it."}
{"text":"Dim sum quality is the worst I have ever had. Service was bad too. Price is expensive given the quality of food... Better go to bliss or or jade dim sum..."}
{"text":"My daughter dis rube as going to a friend's home and had homemade food. The food was excellent and very flavourful."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy coming here! One of the things we like about it is that the dimsum is made fresh to order! Unlike other dimsum restaurants, they don't walk around with the carts until someone orders an item, that's what makes them cold and not so fresh. At perfect kitchen, everything is made fresh and tastes much better!

Depending on how busy it is, it may or may not take a little longer for food to arrive but generally they're pretty quick. Service has always been very good, they're very friendly and very attentive to your needs. I find that prices are a little much (just a tad) but I feel like most dimsum restaurants would be roughly the same. This will always be one of our go-to dimsum places for the fam, they never disappoint! Their other menu items are also very good!"}
{"text":"Just a really solid place to get dim sum. Tasty food, no complaints about the service or the facilities."}
{"text":"My to go place when I don't want to cook for dinner. It offers good quality food at reasonable price, never let me disappointed. Staffs are very friendly."}
{"text":"The Perfect Kitchen is an under the radar restaurant that excels at their craft: producing both traditional and western styled Chinese food fare. Their lunch and dim sum menu items are superb, and their dinners are without comparisons in Mississauga. 

There are many items on their menu, many of which I have tried and can attest to their quality. Some of my favourites include: 

- egg plant garoupa fish hot pot bowl (deep fried fish, egg plant in phenomenal sauce)

- scrambled egg with shrimp (highly recommended) 

- steamed beef patty cake? 

- \"king tow\" sauce pork (amazing) 

- honey pepper beef strips (served on a bed of fried onions - this shit is off the hook)

Among many, many more. Really, you gotta just come here and try a bunch of shit out. If you're in the know, they provide free soup and free dessert as well. Just ask. 

My family has been a loyal customer at this joint for over 15 years. That sort of loyalty can only be boiled up over many years of consistent, excellent food service. The owner is a charismatic man, always happy and willing to make fun conversations. The rest of the staff are literally like a brotherhood. They've been there for many, many years - and their service is second to none, for a traditional Chinese restaurant.

Seek this place out. 

Look no further if you're in need of a legendary Chinese meal in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in the Oakville/Mississauga area! They don't bring food around in carts, rather they take your order and being it to your hot and fresh!

Their dinner is great as well, recommend getting the minced meat fried crab if you come in groups!"}
{"text":"We had a great evening!  Unexpected as we used yelp and the ratings were not great but the pictures were.  We wanted steamed Cantonese fish.  They ordered the fish fresh so had not even arrived when we did early.  Cocktails, 4 A+ other traditional dishes make this a five for five dish experience.  Staff is kind and team oriented.  As a traveler thru the area we will be back."}
{"text":"In the mood for Chinese.  Congee Palace on Winston Churchill and Dundas was absolutely empty with air of desperation as bored staff stared out the windows.  Decided to try Perfect Kitchen as it has always been busy whenever we've tried in the past.  Was quiet but had a couple of occupied tables.  Regulars judging from the interaction of the staff with the patrons.

Service was attentive which is alway a pleasant surprise in Chinese restaurants where the norm is to slam down dishes and tea and bruskly take your order.  Had hot and sour soup and daily soup which was pork bones with herbs.  Just like eating at home and it was delish..

Chicken and cashews, flat rice noodles with beef and sprouts, and Chinese broccoli with garlic.  Generous bowls of steamed rice.  All of it was good and not too oily as can be the tendency in some Chinese restos.  Free red bean dessert came at the end which was a nice surprise.

Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and was not disappointed.  The Perfect Kitchen lives up to its name and the Service was very very good as well!

We ordered a variety of dishes.  We had sweet and sour pork, lobster, shrimp balls, cantonese chow mein, crispy fried chicken, and some other delicious melt in your mouth dishes.

Each dish was fresh and truly made to perfection! The crispy chicken was so tender on the inside and super crispy on the outside!  The Lobster was flavored and seasoned to Perfection!

If you are a lover of Chinese food with good quality and service... go to Perfect Kitchen!

I am positive your experience will be.... \"Perfect\" !"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the service is exceptional. It's one of my favourite restaurants in Mississauga. I go there for dim sum all the time."}
{"text":"Average at best. This is definitely not better than a lot of high class HK joints. Summit Garden is probably slightly better."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time with my parents for late dinners (after 9:30) after our store closed.  I've only been here 2-3 times over the past five years and each time has been very good.  My last visit was the day before Mother's Day 2014 with my mom and my sis' family.

Don't remember the exact order but it was something like:

-Cold cooked chicken with fish sauce (similar to Hainese chicken

-Oyster and tofu pocket with glass noodles hot pot

-Satay beef with veggies

-Sweet and sour pork


All I have to say is this place has the best \"Chinese cold chicken\" in 'Sauga.  I think it's better than the Hainese chicken at Lion City.  

I also really liked the oyster hot pot.  It had a good mixture of things and plenty of tofu pockets (I know because I saw my 6 year old niece eat almost all of them!)

The other dishes were more than adequate.  Overall, this is a great place for small intimate family dinners but it is quite small (maybe 15-20 tables).

Note: located in industrial plaza next to Costco, kind of hidden."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Staff is not friendly at all. Food is average. We had to ask for plates and water. Not a great restaurant experience."}
{"text":"This review is for the 3 times I've ordered take-out from this place, and the only reason I've ordered multiple times is due to convenience sake, as it's on my way home. 

I've ordered the beef chow mein, and the Szechuan chicken each time. The food was fine in flavour and taste, but portion sizes for take-out is quite small. I've actually found it very pricy for the portion sizes we received. For these two dishes, we paid around $25. 

If you pay in cash, it's 10% off. It's located just west of the Costco located on Winston Churchill & Laird Blvd. Don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I got take out from here once because the reviews on Yelp were pretty good. What I got from here didn't add up to what other reviews say. The food wasn't good at all, and ridiculously expensive for the size of the portions. We ordered chicken chow mein, but the chicken looked and tasted undercooked. The bean sprout noodles looked and tasted spoiled. The beef tenderloin wasn't good enough for the price. The lemon chicken was decent. 

There's a Mandarin close by to this place. If you're in the area and want to buy Chinese food for your family, just go to the Mandarin instead and order a dinner for five. You'll save money and that stuff will last you 3 days."}
{"text":"For sure one of the top Chinese restaurants in Mississauga.  I love how clean this place is.  And the owner is a lovable guy with good humor.  Food is very tasty."}
{"text":"This place has consistently served up great tasting fresh food at reasonable prices. The other Chinese restaurants in Mississauga really cannot compete with this place. I have noticed the staff at this place has been here virtually since the place opened and I know why.....they know the patrons and they know how to serve them. Simple as that. This place is euthentic!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. Fast service and delicious dishes. Dimsum is good too, it's a lot fresher since you check off what you want from a list and they bring it to you straight from the kitchen."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to this place for years and haven't left disappointed. It's a small restaurant run with the consistent staff members but they usually have room for small parties without reservations. If you've been to chinese restaurants before this place gives off the same ambiance. This place is one of the better places to get authentic Chinese food in Mississauga at a good price hands down. I recommend the Pepper beef with sauteed onions, its hits on all of the taste factors, salty. sweet spicy and is great with rice. I suggest coming to check this place out ASAP!"}
{"text":"Great people, great food.  Ordered the meal for three, great value.  Friendly staff.  Free parking."}
{"text":"I really have no idea how these yelpers under me rated this place 5 stars. The service was ok but the manager/whoever seems to be in charge was so so so rude. 

Food was not bad, they serve you soup before the meal and sweet soup after. BUT ANYONE NOTICED THAT THEY CHARGE YOU FOR THAT TOO? WITHOUT LETTING YOU KNOW? Too bad we didn't find out until we finished dinner. And on the bill there was only a 'Food' which we could not even check the price. So we checked up the menu again for the price, what we ordered was only $91 dollars with tax. With the sweet soup and soup added up, the price was $115 after tax, we still don't understand how the total came out to be $117.

We feel like we were cheated. If we knew the soup and sweet soup was not free, we would have not had it. Terrible they don't tell you this secret, they are just so smart."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, dim sum and entrees are all great. The owner and service professionals are excellent. My wife and I lived in Tokyo Japan, NJ US and now MD US. Every time we make a home visit back to Toronto we always go back to the Perfect Kitchen. They're hit and sour soup, beef hofun, Cantonese chow mein and dim sum are excellent.   The food beats any Chinese cuisine in NJ, NYC and MD. We miss the food constantly."}
{"text":"Good food but a little overpriced. Went with my buddy and ordered sweet and sour pork, braised bean curd, steamed rice and 2 pop. Bill was almost $40. Good thing my buddy was celebrating his birthday"}
{"text":"I have great, fond memories of eating at The Perfect Kitchen. Years after my first visit, I continue to eat here. During my latest visit, my family and me ate dinner here.

As we arrived, a waiter greeted us, and led us to our table. As always, the decor is simple. The color design on the walls and floor are basic. But I digress. The decor is never the focal point in a Chinese restaurant. 

 As we carefully perused the menu, we selected our items. Tonight, we ordered: sweet and sour pork, white chicken, stir fried broccoli with beef, satay vermicelli and beef, and stir fried crab in black bean sauce. 

The soup of the day was delicious. The pork was tender and delicious. The soup itself is brewed perfectly. 

The sweet and sour pork was delicious. The pork itself was fried crispy, layered over with the sweet sauce. The sweet pepper complimented well. 

The white chicken was tender. The green ginger/onion taste well with the chicken.

The stir fried broccoli and beef was beautifully stir fried. As always, the broccoli tasted amazing (the small tiny trees).

The fried squid was average. The texture was not crispy. The squid itself was bland, with only traces of salt. 

The star of the show, however, is the satay beef with noodle. The beef and vermicelli are stir fried with enough wok hei. The dish is finished off with satay sauce (not spicy). 

The Perfect Kitchen is definitely not perfect, despite the name. Some dishes were average. However, I will return for more delicious Chinese food. If hunger strikes the stomach, venture here. If you are on a date, The Perfect Kitchen is not the perfect romantic choice. But I digress."}
{"text":"What can I say? From the soup at the start, to the red bean dessert at the end, this place is hands down THE BEST Chinese restaurant in Mississauga! And they just keep getting better and better!

This time we ordered the lobster in black bean sauce, the choy sum with garlic and ginger, and the fried bean curd (tofu) stuffed with minced shrimp. This was probably one of the best meals I've had here, and I cannot wait to come back for more. 

And since I come here at least every other week, I thought I would give y'all a few more dishes to try that I absolutely love here:
- Eggplant with minced pork
- deep fried pork chops with spicy salt and pepper 
- fresh crab with minced pork
- ANY steamed fish (call in advance)
- every tofu dish pretty much

The only thing I'd say is that they are a little more pricy than your average Chinese restaurant. Our meal today was little over $100 bucks without tip (all because of the lobster really). But booooooy was it worth it! Check this place out soon."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood on business and decided to check this place out as the reviews were good.

My friend and I ordered Suimai, fried chicken wings, garlic ribs, squid and shrimp dumplings. Portions were good, food was delicious. Took some time to get our order. 

Between the two of us the bill came to $45 inclusive of tips which seemed a bit pricy when compared to eating at dimsum restaurants in Markham & Scarborough.  The last time I paid this price for dimsum was at the Ginza in Tokyo. 

All in all a good experience but just a word of caution to all fellow yelpers. .... the paper they provide you to write the items to order does not include the price so if you are on a budget I would recommend that you ask for a menu to confirm the price."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent customer for over 5 years now. The food never fails to disappoint and the employees are very kind. Notable dishes include the tofu fish roll (kind of like a spring roll except the wrapper is made out of tofu, and the insides are filled with fish and mushrooms) and the Beef Ho Fun (pan fried beef flat rice noodles).

Restaurant is reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Food is ok, today I got chicken wings with visible large chicken feathers. When I asked for a noodle soup to be made before we arrive, was rejected as we haven't got a table number. I insisted that it could be made under my name as a take away as my daughter was in a hurry to go to a program, I was rejected again."}
{"text":"Oh the Perfect Kitchen, this place has become a staple for me and my friends. We usually go in a group of at least 4 people and get a plate per person and share family style. Not sure if this is the right way to do it but it has worked for us thus far. Are staple is the salt and pepper calamari, form there we usually choose a starch, meat and vegetable plate (got to keep it somewhat healthy). The staff has always been friendly and helpful when we have gone and they are usually on top of refilling teas and water before you finish."}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!!

The perfect kitchen is far from perfect. These  yelpers below me must not have had dim sum before.
CHENG FUN is the worst I had. The skin is like plastic like grocery quality.
Fried squid is not fried but dipped in oil.
CHENG FUN with donut fritter is not crispy and does not come with sesame sause.
Tried to cancel a dish but it still came out 15 mins later.

We have much better dim sum places in mississauga. Not cheap either."}
{"text":"Excellent Dim Sum, best in Oakville. The appearance from the outside looks \"industrial\", but the inside is warm and welcoming. Ordering is off a checklist rather than from carts, which is my preference.

Tip: arive at 11:00 to get a parking spot near the door and choice of tables. By 11:15 it was jammed."}
{"text":"So yo, websters dictionary defines perfect as: being entirely without fault or defect, and perfect kitchen is just that. This is the real deal son. Perfect Chinese cuisine with no bs, just really great food.  My homies and I usually come here for special occasions and even when we come here to have food, it ends up being a memorable moment.  The staff is really OG, pay your respects to these guys, really friendly but you gotta be on your game when you order. Atmosphere is like something out of of the start of the Chow Yun-Fat Cinema classic hard-boiled. Visit this place and eat till you stomach bursts. Real spill son."}
{"text":"More traditional Chinese food. Brusque but efficient service. Noodle dishes were delicious and they refilled our teapot promptly. No nonsense decor and affordable prices. Fun stop unless you're looking for chicken balls and red sauce - this ain't that kind of Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to work in the strip mall, and my brother-in-law's older brother is also a regular here, so we are very familiar with the staff. Okay, disclosure made, and I'll write my, still, impartial review.
Since they are a small restaurant, they don't keep an impressive selection of fresh seafood, but they do have a healthy selection of it available. It was my birthday, so I got to choose the lobster from the tank. As lobsters are not in season right now, I was surprised, and impressed, by the plentiful, healthy, and sizable selection available to me. When it came out, we sure cleaned it out very quickly because it was so good.
I couldn't stop grabbing the bass tail we preordered as it tasted so fresh and streamed to perfection.
One dish that you should try is shrimp with egg. Egg was cook to a very smooth texture but not runny at all.
I think this is the furthest west sit down Chinese (Canton) Restaurant in the GTA, so I often dub this as the \"final frontier\", but they surely don't take it for granted as you can feel the pride they have with their food."}
{"text":"The dim sum here is the cleanest and least oily I've ever had. The food does take a little time to arrive since you mark down the items you want, and it's not the carts-style. The food is not greasy and not overly salted. Some would say it tastes plain, but they somehow made it flavourful without all the extra salt and grease. They also don't seem to use garlic in the dishes you would always find garlic in all other dim sum restaurants. Now I love garlic, but they were able to make the dim sum so good without it. Dishes like steamed tripe, beef and pork short ribs, etc. Their siumai however, isn't the greatest, it is too plain. The taste of siumai practically lives on the fat that is put in it, so the siu mai here, although very clean tasting, isn't very flavourful. The hargow is one of the best I've had in recent memory.
Service is pretty good. Since it is a very small place, you get what you ask for almost immediately. No women work here though, which is odd considering you mainly see women in other dim sum restaurants. I guess it's because it's family-owned? It's not a bad thing, just something I noticed. Maybe it was just that day we went.

CON: The variety here isn't great. They were missing staples like egg tarts and mango pudding. Dim Sum without egg tarts? The atmosphere here is not great either. It's almost soulless feeling inside. Not dirty, just not a lively place you would usually feel in other dim sum restaurants. I think maybe because it wasn't really packed. The prices aren't cheap either, but somewhat reasonable."}
{"text":"A great selection of fresh and delicious food. The service is prompt and staff are always friendly and helpful. I've been coming here for years, the quality of food and service have remained consistent."}
{"text":"The Perfect Kitchen is my go to place for Mississauga Chinese food in the evening. I have eaten here on numerous occasions over the past several years. The food is well prepared. The dishes are delicious . The free soup with the meal is great. The price is reasonable. The service  is very good. The restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for dinner for many years. The food is consistently good and always delicious. 

One of our favourite dishes is the shrimp with scrambled eggs. Sounds a little strange, but it's absolutely amazing. The eggs are silky and the shrimp are large, plump and cooked perfectly. 

The Szechuan chicken dish is just the right amount of spicy and is served with lots of crisp broccoli. 

Another favourite (not on the menu) is snow pea tip greens sautéed with extra garlic. 

For a treat, try the lobster stir fried with ginger and green onion. It's absolutely wonderful, but is at market price, so not cheap. 

The waiters are all very friendly and gracious. They're helpful at suggesting possible dishes to try.

We definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We visited Perfect Kitchen for take out one night when we didn't feel like cooking. That happens a lot actually. It's close to our house and we can pre-order while we are tirelessly waiting in the Costco line next door.

Ordered shrimp with lobster sauce, fried rice and fried squid. The food tasted great but was definitely more expensive than most Chinese restaurants. For the 3 dishes we paid $45 with tax. I would like to go back to Perfect Kitchen to try their dim sum, but I prefer other dinner options when it comes to Chinese."}
{"text":"The food quality is above the average Chinese restaurant found in Mississauga. The dim sum is fresh and it doesn't seem to come from a freezer bag like most places. The food is plentiful. It gets packed quickly on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. I do recommend reservations (even for dinner!). We usually get a half chicken, a tofu dish, fresh vegetables, and a seafood dish. Each time it's very tasty, fresh, and very reasonably priced for Mississauga."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely horrendous.   No one even took our drink orders so we just drank the tea the whole time.   Food came out quick but that's because they had another reservation coming.   The food was mediocre, nothing to write home about.  When we asked the waiter for water,  he didn't even respond.  I read on yelp you get soup and dessert and we weren't offered any of that.  Not sure why this place has good reviews but all the servers just looked miserable."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for let's say, 12 years? If not longer, so this review is incredibly overdue. Though that speaks to the quality of this lovely lovely place.

I don't even know where to start because everything is so delicious here. So let's start out with something I like to review at every Chinese place I go to. The mighty Singapore Noodles. And they are mighty here, in portion and in flavour. They don't have peppers and I'm so glad for it. It has the perfect ratio of curry, oil and salt, it's dry, but not dried out. Not overly spicy either, the egg pieces, BBQ pork and shrimp are generous and tasty. Because I can't stand when places are so stingy about the proteins. 10/10 this is my current favourite place for Singapore Noodles.

Next up, Salt and Chili Squid.
Basically like, massive pieces of calamari with crispy outsides. I believe it's rice-based, because if it was gluten I would die a little bit. They are salty, that's for sure. Maybe a bit over salted? But they're still amazing and it's not as if the salt will stop or slow you down. The tiny bits of pepper (cut up bell pepper), they make it a bit sweeter and take away from that saltiness. Honestly, I could eat like six orders of this, but I would likely die. So I try to just keep it to one, that I'm usually forced into sharing.

Green Beans and Beef.
Sounds boring and it looks like a shareable, but I've eaten it on its own and it is quite tasty. The sauce is a great balance of sweet, salty and umami. It's perfect (well it is perfect kitchen after all). Green beans are also cooked to, you guessed it, perfection.

Scrambled Eggs and Shrimp.
This'll be short. I hate scrambled eggs, but these are amazing. Especially with the shrimp. Though, I should add that I only have it with other things. Not on its own.

Szechwan Chicken and Broccoli.
Tons of chicken and broccoli, it's quite spicy as well. It's very much a savoury dish though, no sweetness or anything.

Spare Beef Ribs.
Pretty much what it says. There's a bean sauce I think, it's been a while since I've had it. But it was always pretty great.

Scallops in Phoenix Nest.
Tasty tasty scallops, in a sauce with broccoli inside a fried noodle bowl. It's worth getting at least once and while it's not my favourite, it's still really good.

I have this place as one of my contacts. I order from here about 5 times a month. It's a great place and worth checking out if you love real Chinese food, there's no chicken balls or red sauce, none of that American/Canadianized garbage. Only great food."}
{"text":"Good tim sum place to eat.
I alternate between here, Sam Woo, Golden Fountain and Summit Garden.
Can be quite a line at the door at the lunch rush.
Too bad they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum places in Mississauga.  Just like Hong Kong.  Great service!"}
{"text":"This restaurant lives up to its name.

We had lobster, shrimp balls, Cantonese chow mien, chinese style chefs pork, veggie medley with seafood and more.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great service staff but anyone that has ever had dim sum anywhere else will agree that this is very sub par dim sum and not good value price wise. Sorry"}
