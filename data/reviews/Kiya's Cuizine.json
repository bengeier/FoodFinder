{"text":"I think this restaurant has a lot of potential, they just have some work to do. I got the waffle with home fries. At first taste the waffle was light and crunchy but after a few bites the sweetness of the batter began to overpower the waffle as a whole. My boyfriend got the French toast and when it came out it looked burnt, but it wasn't, they just heavily coated it with cinnamon .... which over powered the French toast as a whole. Don't be hesitant to give this place a try just know they have some work to do."}
{"text":"loved it, nice ambience great service.  and the fried chicken was amazing, the waffles were good too.  great smoothies."}
{"text":"My family and I were excited to try this place; however, we were quite disappointed. The customer service was exceptional but the food itself wasn't the best quality. Because of the lackluster food, I wouldn't recommend (but then again, maybe it was just a bad day for them)."}
{"text":"The food was hot upon arrival and appeared pleasing to the eye. However, my first sign should've been an empty restaurant on a Saturday morning.   I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was good, because you can't go wrong there. Unfortunately, the chicken lacked flavor. Seemingly seasoned in a prepared batter, the chicken was crispy, hot, and flavorless. All in all, the food was bland but reasonably priced. I would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, ambiance was absolutely lovely and authentic. The chefs were caring and came out to check on me and my friends. You're at ease from when you sit to when you leave. Also the prices were unmatched: portions were lovely!  I had the Kiya's breakfast: it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Staff was short but knowledgeable on menu. Food service was spotty and slow. Didn't come out together and it was very scattered. Small portions. We saw plenty of people leaving due to slow and unattentive service. Not apologetic and all seemed confused. I ordered veggie curry stir fry with extra veggies. I didn't receive them. I asked about more and I received them plain with no curry. Cook came out and seemed to have an attitude. I was done. The server really tried to make up for our dissatifaction. One of the cooks came out to help out as well. We were able to express our issues and they heard us out. We told them that no one supports local when you are not delivering. They did mention to us that they will have different classes for food and cooking skills. I would like to come back but I'm not sure if I will."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles to go. The chicken was fried perfectly juicy on the inside not dry at all. The waffle cooked just right and, I also had a 49er smoothie perfect breakfast. The wait staff was friendly and  conversational. I will definitely  be going back."}
{"text":"I've visited this establishment 3 times. I sit at the bar every visit. Each time the food was fresh, hot and delicious. The cooks are totally awesome and friendly. The wait be sooooo long though and the waitress lack knowledge of the menu. This definitely has become annoying. We stood at the register to pay the cashier looked at us and proceeded BACK to the dining area. 10 minutes later we finally got cashed out. We are going to chill out and see if they can regroup and do better!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a breakfast place open on Sunday (on Memorial Day weekend no less) near a friend we were visiting early. And we came upon Kiya's. We were greeted with smiling faces, service was nice, but we were unexpectedly blown away by how good the breakfast was. The eggs were amazing and plentiful, the grits were the BEST we had ever eaten, toast perfectly toasted, turkey bacon nicely done, and I ordered a fresh blended juice to go and it was awesome. And the prices were VERY reasonable. No splenda and coffee a little weak, but that could be our only negative comment. We WILL go back."}
{"text":"I had the chicken wings with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. The chicken was very tasty. The potatoes were not as thick as I like them but also very good. The prices were pretty reasonable they are conveniently located near another location I play pool at. I wish they were open later for the weekly crowd. Very friendly staff and very helpful"}
{"text":"Very Bad. Servers are friendly but lacking skill. Insanely long time to realize that we were foolish enough to wait so long to finally give up and walk out of this terrible \"restaurant\". We left after an hour of waiting, like idiots, for our food and they were petty enough to charge us for our sodas. Total Amateurs. Nice looking place, looking forward to whatever restaurant will take over this location. Very Bad."}
{"text":"Open mouth...inhale food!   I heard about Kiya's from Yelp and decided to give it a try today. It's Day 2 of My Love's birthday weekend celebration so I had to pick a place for breakfast that would be amazing.  Well...  We walk in and were greeted immediately by Janine who was wearing the biggest smile! We were shown to a table and asked her for suggestions since it was our first visit. She recommended the shrimp and grits, and the chicken and waffles...so that's exactly what we ordered. We also decided to enjoy something from the juice bar - The Red Wine and Tijuana Flash.  Drinks: If you LOVE beets, you'll really enjoy the Red Wine drink. I was packed full of beets and other goodness. However, if you are a spicy chick like me...go for the Tijuana Flash. I know you're probably wondering how you could possibly enjoy a drink with jalapeños in it, but TRUST ME...get it! It's just the right amount of kick from the jalapeños and ginger. Simply put, it's a GREAT drink that you should try.  Food: I don't even know where to begin. We inhaled our food. Every bite. Everything was seasoned so well and hot and fresh. I'm not sure what the gravy was that came with the shrimp and grits, but it was so wonderful. One of the things I really liked about that dish is there wasn't a ton of sauce, and the grits weren't runny. Additional salt or pepper were not needed. Just pick up your fork and go to work!  The chicken and waffles were so AMAZING! I love actually eating the chicken and waffles together...pull the meat off of the bone, put it on top of the waffle, and ENJOY! The red velvet waffle ACTUALLY tasted like RED VELVET! The chicken was hot and very well seasoned. It was perfectly crispy and the meat was still so juicy. So far, I have two places where I ABSOLUTELY LOVE chicken and waffles, one place is in Greensboro, the other...Kiya's! You must try them. Tell them I sent you. :-)  Extras: They make their own syrup, a strawberry butter and strawberry cream cheese...I used ALL of it. I enjoyed ALL OF IT! The syrup isn't heavy, but wonderfully sweet without giving you a toothache. We also ordered pancakes because we are just greedy like that. I can't put my finger on the flavor of the pancakes, but they definitely had a flavor. A flavor that was not like just plain buttermilk pancakes. Simply put...ORDER THE PANCAKES TOO!  There aren't too many places that receive 5 stars on my first visit. I try to give them another opportunity to have me HOOKED, something to aspire to and upgrade their rating. Well Kiya's impressed me on the first visit. I don't know how they could get any better...FREE FOOD?!?! Lol, I don't know. I'm anxious to get back there to try other dishes, but it's going to be difficult for me to order anything other than the chicken and waffles. I'll just bring friends, make them order the other dishes, and ask for a taste!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The staff was so kind and attentive. The food was OUTSTANDING! I got the red velvet waffle and chicken with a side of eggs w Gouda cheese and I also got toast because I was that hungry. The waffle was perfect and the strawberry cream that come w it makes even better, I loved how the cheese was folded into the eggs after they were cooked allowing you to taste the cheese better, then the toast was like toasted on the grill in butter almost like a grilled cheese! Just delectable, I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Good little family style restaurant. Food is solid. All the good staples. The are the only restaurant in town that serves BEEF BACON! I recommend it over turkey bacon. Waffles are delicious. They also make fresh fruit smoothies. The only thing lacking is the service. The waitresses all act like it's their first day every time I come. With a well trained, experienced restaurant manager this place could be a gold mine. I wish them much success!!"}
{"text":"Every Time I go to Kiya's the food and servers is awesome. The prices are great and the restaurant is always clean and ready for business. It's shows how hard the Kiyas employees work to keep that place up and running smoothly. I will kiyas is a most eat at restaurants. Y'all go check them out."}
{"text":"Kiya's is located in the small strip mall with CiCi's Pizza and they only serve breakfast and lunch.  The staff is super friendly and the food is very good.  I grabbed a seat at the front counter and ordered the Kiya's breakfast(eggs, a meat, and home fries), they were out of home fries so I had the grits instead with with salmon cakes.  The salmon cakes are freshly made including red and green peppers and taste amazing.  I also tried the red velvet waffle with strawberry butter and it for some reason fell apart when cut but the taste was good.  This spot has good food and seems to be pretty popular judging from the constant stream of customers coming in."}
{"text":"Food was great and not too expensive. The specialty drinks are really good, especially for just $4. It's a nice little spot we came across. The only thing is that the staff is not very organized. I'm not sure why the waitresses don't write down the orders since both times we have come, they have forgotten parts of our order. And then when reminded later when the food didn't come, they forgot again so that's definitely annoying. But like i said, the food is really good and we always enjoy coming."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing. Everything was to my liking...I'm hard to please too! We had the juice and was blown away by the fresh ingredients. The waitresses were super sweet and attentive. The icing on the cake was meeting the chef. He was super nice and wanted our feedback on the experience. Needless to say, I'll be back next time I'm in town. Thank you Kiya for the amazing culinary experience!!!"}
{"text":"First time coming here for a late lunch. My husband said they had fantastic fried chicken wings and they do! We actually split an order of wings, the vegetable Cajun pasta and a side of baked Mac n Cheese and we had food leftover. (Chicken tasted like it came straight from my moms kitchen)Yum! The pasta was out of this world. It's cooked in a coconut cream sauce that was so delicious. Not as spicy as I would have liked but just enough kick that my husband could eat it (he doesn't eat spicy food). Service was great (Vacara took care of us). There was no wait but we had a pretty late lunch (2:30) Will definitely be back. They are open for breakfast and lunch only. I want to try some of the breakfast items. Chicken and red velvet waffles are served during breakfast and lunch. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"My family and I came for breakfast. This cafe is reasonable prices, clean, and family friendly."}
{"text":"Cinnamon vanilla French toast and grits were very good. Went on a Sunday. Cool low key place. Good Playlist for the music."}
{"text":"I am all about supporting new businesses,but my first experience at Kiya's was not the best.My experience is as follows:  -My friends and I were seated and were not greeted by our waitress for a significant amount of time to take our drink orders.It was long enough for us to stop mid conversation to realize it. -Two of my friends wanted to order the steak&eggs to learn they were out of steak which the waitress blamed it on the distributor.Okay,that's fine.They decide to order the shrimp & grits instead.The waitress comes back and states the last two plates of shrimp & grits were sold for the day.This was only after being open for two hours.I couldn't understand that.They ended up ordering an omelette. -Wait time:extremely long;I had to approach my waitress to ask when our food would be coming -Presentation of food:the omelette was delivered on a huge plate which had enough space for three more items to be on the plate yet it was empty. -Delivery of the food:One of my friends ordered a fruit cup to go with her omelette which it did not arrive with the omelette.She told the waitress she didn't receive the fruit cup and the waitress said \"okay\" which we thought she was going to bring it.The waitress never brought the fruit cup.On top of that,when the waitress delivered the food initially she didn't even remember who ordered what as she just approached us with the plates and looked at us.She didn't even know which omelette had cheese and which didn't,as well as who ordered with cheese/without cheese.Allergies were not of her concern. -Customer Service:Our waitress NEVER checked on us throughout our dining experience.She came toward the end wherein we stated we were ready for our checks.She stated \"okay\" yet we never saw her again.Ten or so minutes later my friend makes awkward eye contact with another waitress who comes to the table to ask if we needed anything.We told her we were waiting on our checks and she informed us you obtain your check at the front/bar.Our waitress NEVER notified us of that.  Overall,this restaurant needs a lot of improvement to be successful.The food is good and affordable but terrible customer service/service delivery will make one lose business.I wish this restaurant the best and I'm willing to give it another try in several months."}
{"text":"We got here and sat there waiting for about five minutes before I got annoyed and asked to be seated. Then we were walked to a table that wouldn't accompany all five of us, then we had to wait to have until one was cleaned off. After being in the establishment for about 15 min now, we are finally seated. There was one waitress trying to service about 25 patrons; really?!?! In a effort to speed up the process we gave her our drink and food orders at the same time, but that did nothing! The waitress brought  out the wrong amount of drink so I inquired about about the rest of them; and was told they were out of tea! Out of tea and grits at a breakfast establishment, imagine that! After waiting for about another 20 minutes only one of our orders was brought and it was wrong!!! Burnt pancake and sausage when she asked for bacon. With no silverware! Needless to stay I made the executive decision that we were leaving. The place seemed to be a good place to visit by the amount of ppl that were there but the customer service was awful. Come and give me some thing to work it, don't ignore me for 45 min when I'm here to support your business! The one single reason I gave this place 1 star because they had beef bacon and beef sausage. If you have a lot of patience and all day to have brunch I recommend this place. I do not plan on trying this place again!"}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible! Waited 1 hour to put order in. I had already preordered some plates for a child's bday party and it took them an hour just to bring out the drinks. One of my guests said the coffee was cold. I was pissed so I can't review the food because I didn't eat after the customer service was so bad!"}
{"text":"What they do well, they do well. Great blackened salmon. Great shrimp and grits. Lunch scheduled for 11:30am. No soup or desserts. They don't start till 1:30pm. No coffee. Servers are nice but seem to be struggling with serving. No silverware. No refills."}
{"text":"This local gem just opened 2 months ago and doesn't disappoint. It is located in a strip mall right off of university blvd. I came in for lunch on a Friday & Saturday. Since I like to try a little of everything when I first come to a restaurant, on Friday I had the red velvet waffles and chicken wings and my cousin had the shrimp and grits. The presentation for the shrimp and grits was wonderful. They sautéed and seasoned the shrimp perfectly. The grits were creamy and had the right consistency. (Not too soupy and not too hard). The chicken wings were PERFECT!! Seasoned perfectly and fried perfectly. The waffle was warm and fluffy. They give you syrup and a strawberry butter to put on top. The flavor combo with the waffles will make you feel like it's a party in your mouth.  On Saturday I ordered 3 sides. My order consisted of crab cakes, blackened salmon, Mac & cheese, roasted corn and sautéed spinach. The salmon was a nice portion. They seared it on both sides, so it had a nice crunch and was cooked to order. The roasted corn medley had peppers and onions in it and was very fresh. The Mac and cheese was cheesy. The spinach was flavored well. Everything came out hot. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the items on the menu. The waitress was very pleasant and kept checking on us to make sure we were good.  They also have a specific vegetarian menu and  a juice bar where they make fresh fruit and veggie juices if you're looking for a healthier option."}
{"text":"Disappointed...let me preface with this; this place has a lot of potential. It was my anniversary breakfast with my wife, wanted to try something new, where we have never been before.  1.9:30am We ordered drinks, milk and juice for the kids. Sweet tea for me and a Tijuana juice for my wife (spoiler alert...waitress basically refused to make my wife juice) 2. Brings out oj for my son(2yrs old),Styrofoam cup with no lid, milk for my daughter(5yrs old) Styrofoam cup no lid. My sweet tea had so much sugar I could feel the grains of sugar. No juice for my wife, says I still have to make it, no problem. 3. 9:40 Order food. Shrimp and grits, the pancake combo(3 pancakes, eggs, turkey sausage), an order of salmon cakes, chicken and red velvet waffle, and a bowl of fruit. 4. Refills my sweet tea, still no juice for my wife.  5. We all go to the restroom, men's room clean, toilet seat is broken and sliding all over the place, not good for a potty training 2yr old. Wife had to wipe the toilet in women's bathroom because it was covered in dried pee. Waitress brings a water for my wife, saying she will make her juice in a minute  6. 10:10am food is served, not hot not cold, all brought out at different times, only 2 pancakes supposed to be 3, little ramikens that barely hold enough of anything for what's it's used for, grits were solid and not creamy, salmon cakes were dry and burned fruit had no flavor, sausage had a funny taste shrimp was room temp. Red velvet waffle was good, a little under cooked for my liking. Still no juice. 7. 10:30 waitress comes back and says you can pay at the bar. My wife again asks about the juice, and waitress responds, I have to make it, my wife told her not to bother. 8. Go to bar to pay, she did not know how to enter the restaurant dot com coupon I had, this is where I found out about this restaurant. With a $15 discount was still $21, I tipped 10% of discounted price, she deserved something, but not more than what I gave.  Moral of this story, they tried to be higher class than they are, and they failed miserably. Didn't  complain about the food because server never returned and we were starving by the time our food arrived."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place since I had heard people raving about it. Sadly I was disappointed and first impressions are everything. We ordered take out and maybe that was the reason it was bad but still no excuse. Now I will say, the food had potential to be pretty good but the service and presentation was sup par. We waited 45 min to receive a waffle with no syrup or special topping like you get when you order in. We also got their smoothies...2 different kinds..both GROSS, tastes like somebody made it that did not know what they were doing. Smoothies were very bland and not blended well..taste like something mixed up by a 2 year old. They didn't have bags for take out, lucky we only had 2 plates and a 2 drinks but others were walking out with several takeout plates almost dropping them. Just not a good first impression...I think I would eat there again..only dine in though and no smoothies!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice during business hours... both times they were unexpectedly closed.. when are they ever open?!"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying this place is a hidden gem! I am so happy my sister recommended this place! I highly recommend the shrimp and grits or chicken and waffles! You won't leave disappointed. Tito and his staff really know how to cook! #whatfood #cleanedmyplate #kiyascuizine"}
{"text":"Kiya's Cuizine was outstanding ! I will be coming back and bringing more people. I brought my family here yesterday and they were impressed. I had the red velvet waffle and it was nothing like I've tasted before."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday around 1:30 with the hubby to order food to go. As soon as you walk in the whole staff greets you which is always a plus for me. They were very busy/backed up so it took our food quite a while to  get to us but it was definitely worth the wait. I had the red velvet pancakes and chicken wings. The wings were seasoned very well and nice and crispy. The pancakes come with a delicious strawberry butter and syrup that was great as well. Hubby ordered the turkey burger and fries and it was honestly the best turkey burger I've ever tasted. I usually get angry if my food takes that long but the staff was so attentive, so nice, and working soooo hard that you couldn't get mad at them! It's a small staff pumping out great food. I hope they do well and we will continue to support them!"}
{"text":"Recently moved close to this place. Great menu options, and everything we had (from chicken and waffles to smoothie) was awesome. Everybody was friendly and the interior was clean and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"UPDATE: My cousin invited me to brunch with her, suggesting Kiya's Cuizine. Even though I had an awful experience during my first visit, I'd always intending on returning to give them another chance. My first thought was, \"I better eat a snack before going, just in case we have to wait 40+mins for our food again,\" but I was PLEASANTLY surprised!  We were seated immediately and our drink orders were taken. They don't offer decaffeinated coffee so my cousin was a little disappointed but settled with regular coffee. Our drinks came out and her cream and sugar came in a little plastic cup, which I've never seen before. I would suggest they get little packets at some point in the future. We placed our order (chicken and waffles, mine was red velvet and my cousin had a regular waffle) with our friendly waitress Jaylin, and the clock started. I wanted to give her an extra couple of minutes to get to the back and actually put the ticket in. When I tell y'all our food came out in 8 minutes!! I was shocked!! A COMPLETE turnaround from our first experience! The food tasted DELICIOUS and was very reasonably priced!! $8 for the chicken and waffles and you get a good portion of food, was a WIN in my book!! The bathroom was clean and well-kept which rounded of an overall EXCELLENT experience! I noticed the chef walking around and greeting people which made me feel like he cares about the food that he prepares. As we were leaving, I admitted to him that our last experience wasn't great, but this MORE than made up for it!! He was very friendly and explained that he's been having a difficult time keeping dedicated employees that are able to meet the demands of the guests.   After this experience, I would absolutely recommend that you give them a try!! They seem to be working the kinks out and are in a MUCH better place than they were during my first visit. If you've gone before and didn't like it, give them a try or you'll be missing out on some good food and great prices!!"}
{"text":"I wish Kiya's opened while I was in college at UNCC because I'd be there all the time! The waiting staff was helpful and patient in answering all my friend's questions. I got the chicken and red velvet waffles with a side of scrambled eggs with gouda, the wait for our food was about 15 minutes. The waffle was soft and melted in my mouth, the strawberry cream cheese sauce that came with it was a perfect pairing. Chicken was seasoned well and crispy, and the eggs were delicious. Our waiter frequented our table often and refilled our waters when we asked. The music was lit, which led to an even better experience! The chef came out to ask how our meals were which was an added touch. I'd recommend Kiya's to anyone in the university area looking for good breakfast food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is definitely going to be my new lunch spot! They opened in February and the owner and the workers there were so nice! They checked on us plenty of times, the chef came to our table to ask how we liked our food, and they told us they even offer live music (clarinet or saxophone) on some Sundays.   I ordered chicken and waffles (didn't do the red velvet) and was blown away! They make their own condiments and the chicken was fried to perfection. How did my chicken still have the fresh out the grease taste and heat after 20 minutes?! The skin of the chicken was so good and super crispy! The waffle and syrup were both very light and went perfectly with the chicken! Not too often you can get chicken and waffles (served all day-hot damn) for $8.58 with chicken that actually tastes decent!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Kiya's Cuizine. I have heard many things about this restaurant, some good and some bad. After trying a lot of the breakfast spots in town, I felt it was fitting that I tried this one as well, especially since it's close to me.  When my wife and I arrived, we were immediately greeted and seated without any issue. We needed a few extra minutes to order due to this being our first visit. I knew I was going to try the red velvet waffle and chicken wings. Obviously, I've had waffles, I've had chicken wings... but I've never had them together. Dynamic duo! So I ordered this with a side of grits. My wife originally ordered the steak and eggs but was told after placing this order that they did not have any steak. Partially defeated, she scanned over her menu again and resolved to have the scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, and toast.  After what seemed like a particularly extended amount of time, our food arrived. At first without silverware, but this was quickly remedied. I tasted my red velvet waffle and it was delicious in all its red velvety waffley goodness. The chicken was piping hot, which was good. Just that first bite was a doozy.   The wife, however, didn't enjoy her meal quite as much as I enjoyed mine. She especially didn't like the turkey sausage. After tasting a piece of one, I noticed it had a terrible flavor. This most likely didn't come from how it was cooked, but more so from the brand. Either way, I wasn't a fan either. She did like the grits. She thought they were exceptionally good.   When we were done, we waited quite a while for the ticket to be brought to the table. It was only after the wait did we learn that you must pay at the bar. I wasn't in a hurry today but I could see how something like this could be a problem. When we went to pay our tab, the cashier was very friendly and personable.  All in all, I want to try this place again when some of the kinks are worked out. I see unlimited potential. I hope they are able to learn from their mistakes and build from them.  If and when they do, you will find that this place will be a new Charlotte staple."}
{"text":"Excellent food, services and outstanding location-  If you have not had the pleasure - Please do yourself a favor and check them out!!!  Ask for Patrick when you arrive -  just to shake his hand"}
{"text":"Second time here.  First time food was good.   This time no one here, As in not open.  No sign,  no warning.  Several other customers came by and ove couple shared this wasn't the first time.   Trying to support."}
{"text":"Dropped in for Charlotte Black Restaurant Week! So glad I did! This hidden gem is in my neck of the woods and so desperately needed. And the food was great to boot. If you follow my other reviews then of course you know I got the chicken and waffle. Both were scrumptious. I suspect they make their own syrup too because it was way too thick to come out of a bottle. They serve the butter already melted  so you're not tearing up your waffle trying to slater it on. It's those kinds of small touches that I LOVE! It yells, I care about your dining experience even to the minor details. The owner came out and checked on me, he's a cutie too! I am too stoked to come back and try their lunch menu. That curry chicken is calling my name. You definitely have to give them a try!"}
{"text":"I regret the first review I left where I bragged on the food & the service. Last time I went in & my food was made incorrectly through an assumption. The cook refused to remake my food & LIED about why. Probably won't go back. I was literally the only person there so they were not busy, just unfriendly."}
{"text":"Love the shrimp and grits there, I would only recommend they find a better selection of music and they have the correct time they open on the door ."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this spot on Saturday evening and I was there Sunday afternoon... needless to say, I'm all for supporting local business and trying good food.   Entering the restaurant, we were greeted and immediately seated with our drink orders taken. By the time our drinks arrived, we were prepared to order our food... 3 minutes or less, not enough time to fuss over. The wait came with the food, because the orders are made fresh (literally, we were the only customers there at the time and we could smell the food being cooked). The only minor setback was how long it took for me to receive an order from the juice bar, as it came a little before the food. However, once we got our food I was good and felt no need to bring it to the owner's attention, as he did stop by our table to make sure everything was great.   I ordered the blackened chicken with a side of broccoli casserole, baked macaroni and garlic herb mashed potatoes (the dish comes with 2 sides but I wanted 3...don't judge me). My mother ordered blackened salmon with spinach, garlic mashed potatoes and she later ordered a side of broccoli casserole - be sure to enjoy your salmon with the seafood sauce on the side. My sister ordered crab cakes, baked macaroni, broccoli casserole (see a trend here?) and an additional side of yellow rice! Not only were we stuffed but the food was GOOD! For this place to have only been open for a little under a year, the owner has this place going in the right direction! His name is Tito and I believe he's there on most days... so if you have questions or want to simply shake his hand... ask for him, you'll be glad you did!   Go support and have some broccoli casserole for me!"}
