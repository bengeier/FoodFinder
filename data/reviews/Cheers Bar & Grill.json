{"text":"Went to Cheers in hopes of watching the Kings game because I'm from LA. Went inside and the guest bartender Tommy was cool enough to find it for me, they have 3 good sized tv screens surrounding the bar so multiple games can go on at once. I met some great UNLV students who gave me some great tips on the town and the drink prices were great ( $4.50 for each beer is cool by me... Beats $7 at a lot of places). They have pool tables all around and juke box constantly jammin great rock tunes. I'll be back tonight for another kings game! Definitely should check this spot out."}
{"text":"Very chill environment, friendly bartenders, decent selection of drafts. They've got pool tables, a piano in the corner that they don't care if you bang on, you can bring in Roberto's from next door if you get hungry...perfect place to unwind after a long day!"}
{"text":"2013 Review Journal's Best of Las Vegas in the Dive Bar category. Tori is, by far, the best, most attentive, fun and sexy bartender in the city! Catch her from Thursday through Sunday evenings. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a nice, friendly place to meet some of the locals and hang out. I was greeted very nicely by Tori, the bartender and felt welcomed right away. It wasn't too busy when I first got there and when I mentioned that it was my first time there, Tori told the crowd about it and introduced me to everyone. I thought it was really nice of her to do that. GREAT service as others have already mentioned. 

Everyone was friendly and seemed to be having a good time. I'm only in town for another three weeks but I'm sure that I'll be stopping in again before I leave. Looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Stopped by after class and absolutely enjoyed myself! Fun, down to earth dive bar! The atmosphere is amazing with their sexy lighting. Good music and great vibes. The bartender greeted us with welcoming gestures. Tori accommodated us with delicious drinks! She was awesome!!! Social and fun! I will recommend Cheers bar and grill to anyone! Yay"}
{"text":"Perfect neighborhood bar and a welcoming spot for a Detroit sports fan. If a Detroit/Michigan team is playing a game, it will be on the tvs. They do not serve food but you can bring food in (there is a Mexican restaurant right next door). My first trip there will not be my last. It will be a certain stop every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Cheers is a legendary dive bar located on Maryland Pkwy, where a few years ago a crazy person threw battery acid into the face of a bartender! If you wanna mix it up with crazies, college kids, rock n rollers, hipsters and IRA members in hiding hit this place up!"}
{"text":"The place definitely has an atmosphere. The bartenders are great, live music on a Saturday was plain awesome. When you pair this with ridiculously low prices that`s a pretty good recipe for success. Maybe that`s why the damn place was packed..."}
{"text":"Great bar, Tori provides fantastic, friendly service...nothing fancy mind you, but that's the way I like it."}
{"text":"I go in every time Adam is there for 7js i need to know this guys schedule. We coming in june through august"}
{"text":"A solid dive bar. Cheap drinks, close proximity to greasy food, and bartenders with a heavy pour."}
{"text":"This has been my neighborhood bar for about a decade.  Good pool tables, reasonable drink prices (cheap Guinness during Happy Hour).  Good staff and a very mixed crowd."}
{"text":"Best dive bar in Vegas!  Found out about this place on Yelp a few months ago. Best idea if you are sick of being taken advantage by the local casinos and bars on the strip. It's well worth a little drive out of the way to experience great drinks,  great vibe, and great prices. This will be a regular stop each time we're in this neck of the woods. Nice place to get your drink on anytime of day or night. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tori is simply the most fun bartender in my experience. She's quick with a joke and a drink, and really knows how to entertain her customers."}
{"text":"Small bar, seems like  a lot of locals hit up this place. I had a date with this guy & meet him here. He frequents this bar a lot & loves it. Female bartender was very nice & attentive. They have a juke box that is poplar & played a lot. Couple pool tables, dart board & golf video game. Drinks are super cheap!!! 3-4 large draft beers & 2 Ketel & diet cokes came to $20. Located near UNLV but it wasn't a young college crowd. Wasn't too busy for a Saturday night. They also have video poker machines, I didn't play though so not sure how the winnings are on them. Place allows smoking but I didn't find it very smokey inside."}
{"text":"I was born in Vegas and I love this place!!One of the few places in town I can get a Guiness on tap!!! Also the bartenders friendly and accomidating. A must stop if your in the area!!!"}
{"text":"another semi-dive bar. Friendly bartender and a most definite locals hangout. Free pool on sundays and plenty of tv's for football. Will be back next trip."}
{"text":"Awesomeness!!! Get buzzin like a bee hive then attend class, return to Cheers with classmates and get bent like knees."}
{"text":"Came in here to kill some time and ended up spending my entire afternoon here, and then brought wifey back for round two on the last night of our vacation. The bartenders are excellent. Bonnie was a delight! This place reminded us of our local bar in Denver and we will definitely be back next time!!"}
{"text":"Dive bar in the true dive bar sense, not some place invaded by hipsters that only drink PBR and Jameson. It's a local's joint and most everyone there is a regular. If you're hanging out around UNLV and looking for a cheap and stiff drink make sure to stop by."}
{"text":"Definitely a mixed bag of people in this place, but they're fun.

We actually ended up here one night on a half-joking recommendation by a bartender at Freakin Frog, and I'm somewhat pissed we didn't come here earlier because it wasn't until 2 or 3 by the time we got there.

I had some trepidation because of the characters milling around outside when we walked up.  After going in, I got that \"WTF am I doing here?\" feeling when I saw the crowd and when they saw us.  However, that all ended when a friendly bartender ran up and asked us what we wanted.  We got a couple cheap pitchers of something.  I honestly don't remember what they were.

Anyway, I ended up shooting the longest game of 8 ball ever with a random cool guy named Grimace.  Also, a couple of flea bags who know their way around a meth pipe seemed to be passing a relatively cute redhead back and forth nearby.  (She may have been trying to get away.  I could barely take care of myself or hit a straight on shot...)  Her drunk (maybe high) ass fell into me, and I have to say, she smelled surprisingly good and actually apologized.

Actually, I would go to Cheers just for the fact it's like next door to Roberto's Tacos."}
{"text":"Tori is always super friendly and takes wonderful care of her costumers! Best bartender in vegas!"}
{"text":"Having lived in the area most of my life I had passed by Cheers many times thinking it was just a little smoky hole in the wall not worth checking out. That was up until about 2 weeks ago when my friends and I went to a nearby bar that we usually frequent, only to find out it was full of douche bags that night. 

After deciding we didn't want to deal with that all night, one friend suggested Cheers as it was so close by. We all thought, \"Eh, why not give it a try?\" 

I am so glad we did. The bartender was super friendly and we never had to ask him for another drink as he was super attentive and made sure we had what we needed the whole time. He even suggested a drink to my friend when she ordered an apple beer. He said to drop a shot of fireball whiskey in it, and it was actually pretty enjoyable. They have a good selection on the jukebox, plenty of tvs and they even have a punching bag game. 

I love this place."}
{"text":"The name's a little misleading:  If you go there long enough, yes everyone will know your name.  And it is definitely a bar.  But try as I might, I can't really figure out why Cheers insists on keeping 'grill' in its name, unless it's referencing the now defunct window that used to serve up Mexican fare from the Roberto's next door.  (The new smoking laws have now rendered it necessary to actually leave the bar and walk next door.  Pain in the butt.)

Regardless, Cheers is a good, low key place to catch up with some friends, have some big, cheap beers, and shoot a few racks of pool on one of the 5 or so fairly well maintained tables that are available.  The crowd is pretty evenly split between twenty-and-thirty-somethings and older, video poker playing denizens.  The TVs behind the bar show a satisfying mixture of sports, reality TV, and random movies.  The ambiance is lacking, so bring your own with you in the form of a few good stories and a few raucous laughs.  Don't miss the Pin the Penis on Steve-O game or the Galaga arcade game in the corner near the entrance."}
{"text":"If you were in search for a place to watch Detroit Red Wings game or any Detroit game in general... this would be the place to be! If you were looking for a Meatheads replacement, this is where you'll find it. Tori is an awesome bartender and she makes you feel right at home. The bar is decorated with Detroit flags and Michigan license plates. There always seems to be Detroit fans in the house and you instantly bond by pointing at your hand to show what part of Michigan you're from. But don't get it twisted because everything that ever existed was made in Port Huron. LMAO"}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome place to grab a drink after class. Tori the bartender is the best! Come here for some cheap beer and good times!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Fun bartender. If you like Detroit sports check it out. Oh, Tori is awesome, friendly and funny. I suck at writing reviews. 5 stars all day."}
{"text":"When we first got in we were a little weirded out because the bar was kind of dark and it didnt look great. The bar attender was really nice at the beginning, but when we started playing pool she got a little pissed off and stopped being friendly. She overcharged us for the beers, and stopped being nice. Never going back again!"}
{"text":"This truly is the place where everybody knows your name. It's a dive bar, no doubt, but the experience is fun and the drinks are cheap. The bartenders are friendly and talkative. There's pool, music and occasional parties.

As with all dive bars, expect some seedy creatures, funky smells and a dark decor. It adds to the experience."}
{"text":"Great bar! The bartenders are awesome! Tori is one of the best. Never have to wait for a drink. Prices are reasonable. You can always make a friend at Cheers."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time by accident after a loooong day at work and I just have to say...TORI IS THE BEST!!! She was more then friendly and really knows how to treat customers. I will definitely be back to see her!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard dive bar - pool, tvs, random crowd or lack of crowd. It's smoky as hell in there, so if you're a non-smoker like me, you probably won't be able to last longer than 2 drinks. Plus, I don't think you'll ever win on the video poker machines. On the high side, prices are pretty good, and the bartender is friendly. Makes a nice place to stop if you're doing anything at UNLV, but other than that, I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Cheers."}
{"text":"When I was in the neighborhood, I had to stop off at my favorite University hangout. So many of them had changed names over the years. I still have a Moose Mcgillicuddy's shirt, one of the first places I went to get security warning drunk. 

Cheers was a hidden bar, I think you have to know someone to go to it for the first time or you'd never find it? That was the case for me, my first time I was driven there on a night of debauch. I had no idea where we were in relation to any area of town, I couldn't even see the Strat or Luxor light. Doomed. 

The biggest memories I had of Cheers occurred one year when I was in town alone for the holidays with xmas eve and day off. It sucks because of the last 4 holidays of the year, I always bargain to work Thanksgiving, xmas day and eve to score new years day off and a lunch shift if not off new years eve. 

One of the rules I made for drinking on my 23rd birthday (I got alcohol poisoning on my 20-22nd b-days) was that I would drink to remember, not to forget. Well, I didn't like to have xmas off, everyone was out of town. I had patrolled the strip and saw all the Jewish, Vietnamese & other non-christians out. 

Bars are open 24/7, well you'd be surprised how many bars start looking for their keys to doors that had remained open the other 364 nights/ year. I think I was on my 4th bar and I think I got a text to go to Cheers. This is 7+ years of accumulated blackout drunk memories, so my memory is like the reception of a portable tv. 

I was on my motorcycle and don't even want to know how I got there. I usually sat and ate something until I felt Monday at 9:00AM sober, paper pusher style before driving. Except for twice. And I still have the ptsd to lurch me out of sleep randomly to celebrate. 

We played pool, ordered Mexican from next door & they put it in the service window when that was legal to. We had such a great time we planned it for the following year, then again... 

It turned out to be one of the best Vegas xmas's I ever had. It was the wayward holiday crew, people who had no where to be because they couldn't get time from work. Or they just didn't want to be home alone. Or they strategically escaped their family with an excuse. It was us holiday left behind folk. And we were alright without the holiday stress to get everything prepared and everyone over the house, etc.

There was even a drunk Santa. Did we make out? Who did I kiss, it smelled like ash, red wine and the hopes and dreams of people stuck at the airport. 

I know we celebrated there the year before and a couple of years after the \"clean air\" act passed, and dining areas had to have a physical wall/ window separating the bar area. My argument was I didn' t want to sit in the dining area alone while everyone was partying. It should be my choice to bring food in where people are smoking. Whatevs, laws be cray. I voted against it and I don't even smoke. Damn window plastered up!

Always great service from the bartender, made me feel welcome and hung out and talked with us like she was happy to be there. They have the life, I loved bartending.

So I had to pay my own tribute to the wayward holiday vagabonds even though I was 5 months off. (and about 7-8 years past). I don't know what happened the first year I didn't go. I didn't want to be the guy that got too busy and left my warriors behind!

As I type this, it's Mother's Day. It's another holiday I can't really celebrate and I think of the others who can't also, because their mother passed away or some other reason. Maybe we'll have to think of a place where we can go to feel better and not think about another holiday that just bombards those of us without."}
{"text":"oK. Sooo.I'm a Dallas Cowboys fan. My bf.... a 49ers fan. YUP.. love is blind. So this past sunday our games were showing @ the same time = we had to go someplace to watch our games together. Some people can't beleive I could even walk next to much less be WITH a 49er fan and vice versa.  We take a lot of flack about it but that's ok, everyone has a fan. 
We orig. went to a \"Cowboys\" bar b/c I won the coin toss. Yes most of my important decisions are decided the good old fashioned way, the quarter. If its good enough for the NFL, its good enough for me. 
The bar we went to was listed as a Cowboys bar. UM NO. It was Rascals on Swenson/Maryland pkwy area. Can we say scary neighborhood. OMG. I was worried I wouldnt make to my car on time, but that's another review.

This place was our 2nd choice and I was very surprised by it. I pictured it much fancier but I was glad it wasnt. I dont like fancy fancy. I'm here to watch football not much else! The bartender, Mary Ann was so sweet! 
I loved her. She TOO was a 49er fan so she and my bf made friends quickly. She had several games on different TVsbut the volume was only on for the 49er/chiefs game which was a blowout and very hard to console my bf. I cheer for his team unless they are playing me, then we all bets are off! but I refuse to wear 49er gear. I draw the line there!

Now MaryAnn, was so sweet she turned up my game so that I TOO could have volume. That is my biggest thing when selecting a bar. If you've ever read any other of my reviews you know I HATE when bars show sports games and then play music. really? Well not this place. I would def. go back!
PRICES: $3 FOR 22 OZ draft beers - budweiser and bud light.CANT BEAT IT! And.. when I asked her what she had on special she said that they have 24 hr happy hour. Well cant' beat that either.

POOL TABLE COUNT: 3

This place is near UNLV and maryland pkwy/Harmon area. kinda hidden and I wouldnt have seen this place if I wasnt looking for it. But now I know its here.. I might just have to add this to my rotation!"}
{"text":"That is it mang, seven j, this shirt is 5 stars, nothing compare to LA m9-1. Will forever visit this place on every Vegas trrip!!!!!, recommend Adam afamadam mang!!!"}
{"text":"A typical college bar that could be located just off any college campus in america.  Drinks were reasonably priced . . . with a good selection of midwestern beers . . . what memories.

The bartender \"Mikal\" was the Bomb . . . she had more blond jokes than anyone I know . . . most of which I have never heard . . . she even laughed at my lame jokes.

A definate spot to stop if one either a dive bar tour or looking for a college bar to hang-out at."}
{"text":"Love, love this bar. Just like being \"home\". Very comfortable, great attentive bartenders, good atmosphere, cheap drinks and endless entertainment from the best bartenders off the beaten path. Cheers is the place to be for some real downhome fun. I bring all my out of town visitors here and they can't wait to come back. Keep the good times coming. Thanks Cheers! You're the best."}
{"text":"Spent 300$ on double bucks for this who like to gamble. Not one bonus. Not good gaming"}
{"text":"Tori is amazing, great service, best bartender we met in vegas! If you are looking for a bar's bar, you have to check it out!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with a great atmosphere!  The kind of place that locals love.  Very casual and relaxed atmosphere that welcomes you to be yourself."}
