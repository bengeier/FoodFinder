{"text":"Not sure what's going on at this location lately. It's obviously under new management because none of the regular suspects are working anymore.   The debit/credit machine is often not working now, and when it is the receipt shows up as \"My Sandwich\". I am one to look at my receipt so I can assure you it used to say \"Sandwich Box\".   Also the bread selection has changed, my go-to whole grain panini is now thicker and doesn't toast up as nicely. They are much skimpier with the sandwich toppings and the side salad is always over dressed.   Pretty upset about this new development. May have to resort to Quiznos in the future, or, god forbid, make my own lunch!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, it was awesome! Lots of selection. Ingredients were very fresh and the staff were friendly. Apple and mango chutney is wonderful. Personally was not a fan of the green salad that came with the sandwich, too much dressing would definitely ask for it on the side next time. Biggest downfall is there is limited seating. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The Sandwich Box is a great place. It offers delicious, gourmet sandwiches from the best, fresh and natural ingredients including options of 5-10 breads, spreads, meats and greens for $8.99. You can order a menu-made sandwich or design your own. It's a bit expensive for what you get but the variety and quality of ingredients makes up for it. If you're in the area, Sandwich Box is the way to go. It isn't an \"everyday\" lunch place because of the price but I'll definitely go back for a second munch in a couple weeks."}
{"text":"Service is on the meh side but the sandwich and salad were fresh and tasty. It's always great when you can customize your own lunch"}
{"text":"The Sandwich Box has grown in popularity and now space, having moved to Richmond.  It worries me slightly as small places grow bigger that they will lose the original care and dedication that they put into their food.   I can remember watching the owner of Sandwich Box (back when it was on Queen) making one of my sandwiches and a friend commenting to me...\"now that is a man, who loves the food he is making\".   And you could truly taste the art behind the sandwich, the thought that went into its design.  The last sandwich I had at Sandwich Box (Richmond location) was not the best.  However, this is still a four star for me because of the year and half that I spent going there for a satisfying lunch.  I would suggest the Rosemary Focaccia, chipotle mayo and aioli spreads, chicken, roasted red peppers, tomato and asiago cheese.  its pretty damn fantastic.   Their Onion/Potato Focaccia is a solid choice as well."}
{"text":"The sandwich is so yummy, will defi recommend others to come, but just one thing,  why the kale chip is so salty?"}
{"text":"This place is a great sandwich shop if you don't mind spending the extra dime. The healthy options are quite extensive and they offer a variety of proteins, Gluten-free options, grain options and spreads. However, like I mentioned before, the price point may be an issue. Located adjacent to the bay subway station, this place conveniently offers some pre-made sandwiches (the regular sliced bread kind) or more meal - type sandwiches ($9.50+tax). The meal-type sandwiches comes with a larger bread and side salad. Don't get me wrong, the heavy grain and breads that they have, can make the meal quite filling.  I have tried the breakfast bagel (zaatar, tomato and cream cheese on white bagel) as well as a avocado, brie and tomato sandwich. With a brownie cookie (Gluten-free) as dessert. The total cost came out to about $15.  Overall, tasty, healthy option, pricy."}
{"text":"So basically what happens here is... You stand in line and pick a number of toppings for your personalized sandwich. But the toppings are overwhelming, so I 100% recommend you to look it over on their website first and pick out what you want. Because once you're in line, there are no 'umm's and 'uhhh's.  OR you can just choose from their Express Menu, which is small list of sandwiches that have pre-picked toppings. But if you can customize your own sandwich to exactly what you want, why settle?  My bread: Rosemary Foccacia. My toppings: brie cheese, smoked chicken, and avocado (mmmmmm...)  Each box also comes with a mini salad, which I wasn't too fond of. Dressing was blah, and the salad was pretty warm since it was next to my steaming hot sandwich, but I guess there isn't really anything they can do about that! I half wished my cheese didn't melt so much so I could stuff the salad into my sandwich, but nahhh the melted cheese was awesome.  For $10, I wouldn't say that it is worth the price since I was hungry again 2 hours later (as was my coworker who came with me). But I did really enjoy my sandwich! I can see myself coming back for sure - especially on days I'm craving certain toppings. I mean, I already know what combo I'm getting on my sandwich next so... :)"}
{"text":"good sandwich, fresh ingredients but pricey for what you are getting and lines are long around lunchtime."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place.  They make the best sandwiches in the city.  All the ingredients are fresh and high quality.  The service is efficient and pleasant.  So far my best sandwich creation is: potato focaccia, sun-dried tomato spread, asiago cheese (goat is good too), tomato, zucchini, arugula.  MMMMMM.  My only complaint is the cramped space...but the line moves very fast so you're not in there for too long."}
{"text":"I reserve one star reviews for only those business completely striving for customer dissatisfaction. Congratulations Sandwich Box!   Basically you pick your bread, spread, vegetables, cheese and meat to make a sandwich. The problem is that each additional \"topping\" is $1.25. The menu does not define what constitutes a topping so I didn't really think about it, figuring it was extra meat or cheese, like any other sandwich purveyor. In fact each vegetable is a topping. So once I had added red peppers, that arugula I added was $1.25 and the onions were an additional $1.25. Bringing the total cost of my sandwich and side salad of mixed greens (which comes with it, not an addd on) plus a can of Pepsi to $14.   At Feshwest Burrito in the TD centre they specifically tell you that if you want guacamole or grilled vegetables it's an additional charge. I would have thought that perhaps the folks at Sandwich Box may have identified that I probably would not be adding arugula to my sandwich at $1.25 if I'd known the way things work. Evidently not.   The sandwich itself was pretty decent. The mixed green salad was disgusting. The dressing was basically just salt from what I could tell and I didn't come close to finishing it."}
{"text":"Since sandwiches are one of my favourite things in this world, I was excited to try Sandwich Box, and, they didn't disappoint! They offer a healthy \"build your own\" sandwich concept, with a wide array of breads/meats/cheeses/and toppings to choose from.  Besides having delicious sandwiches, Sandwich Box does a great job of displaying their Sandwich and Salad ingredients. Not only do they have a ton of options to choose from, but, everything looks fresh, clean and nicely displayed for customers. Good service, AND, most importantly, excellent food, so I'll definitely be back!  A few additional comments: 1) I don't know how long this location has been in business, however, the place has this \"work in progress\" look. You almost get the sense that they started to do their interior design....and then ran out of $$$$ during the process. 2) The place was VERY chilly inside! It felt like there was literally NO heat. 3) Kind of pricey ($13 for a sandwich and bottle of water), but, I guess that's the norm for \"higher end\" sandwiches. I'd rather fork over the $$$$ for this type of sandwich, vs. the cheap/squished \"sandwiches\" that Subway offers!"}
{"text":"For sandwiches, this place is the best in the city. I've never been disappointed. Their soups are great too.   The only reason I'm giving a 4 instead of a 5, is because they changed their little side salad and it just ain't as good anymore, ya hear? Also, it's kinda pricey.  I'm a cheap-o.  But all around delicious and I want it in my belly constantly."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets when it comes to take out - the do it yourself salads are great, as there are TONS of fresh options to choose from.  Their sandwiches for some strange reason taste incredible - I say its strange since its also do-it-yourself, so on some level I would expect them to taste quite predictable - but they dont...they taste better than you predict!  The only down side is I find the price point to be a tad high."}
{"text":"Just an FYI, I will not be reviewing any more lunch establishments for Yelp ... as I am certain this will be the only place I will ever want to eat again.   As so often happens to me, my eye was caught by the colour lime green* (I single-handedly keep Garnier in business...)  as I was walking home from the Y&E centre.   Walking in I was confronted with an immediate choice: Left for sandwiches or Right for salads. I went left and examined the extensive bread selection before opting for the swiss triangle.   Then came more decisions: what spead? (roasted garlic and cumin) want meat? (turkey breast) then 2 more toppings? (caramelized onions, sweet red peppers). Then it gets grilled and served in a little box perfect to stay or go, with a bed of crisp greens perfectly dressed in a light vinaigrette.   There are a lot of organic products and vegetarian and vegan spreads. 2 soup options (one meaty and one vegan). Extra toppings are a dollar a piece, but at $7.95 for the \"build-your-own\" option, I restrained myself.   I sat down and bit into what was the best sandwich I have tasted since I was little and my Grandma made me her special grilled cheese.  I can't even explain the glorious feeling that danced across my tastebuds; everything melded together perfectly.   $10 (exactly, no change) for a sandwich and bottle of water doesn't make this a cheap lunch, but I will gladly sacrifice in other areas in order to fulfill my new life goal: to try every possible combination of sandwich they have (and soups, and salads, and any other line of business they care to pursue).   In short,  I don't care if it's premature, I declare myself a devotee.    *I feel the need to clarify that I do not, in fact, ever WEAR lime green, as that would just be unacceptable in almost any circumstance."}
{"text":"Tip for sandwich box - If you want fast service just go and order the express sandwich of the day. This place is awesome. Just had the panini with roast beef with caramelized onions."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my friends recently, when it is busy there is not much room to sit in, but if you can find a seat it's quite a nice place to have a bite and a chat. The choice was a bit overwhelming for my first time, but I eventually decided on the rosemary focaccia bread with pesto, caramelised onion, havarti cheese and some sort of salami. If you don't have a big appetite two people can share one of the sandwiches, which comes with a very simple great tasting side salad. Love it, would definitely choose it over other fast food joints. The price is pretty good too, $10-$12 for a sandwich and a drink."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH!!! If I could write this review in all caps and guarantee that A) people would keep reading, and B) I wouldn't be irritating the crap out of everyone, then I would, cuz that's how excited I am about my first time experience at the Sandwich Box, at their Yonge & Eglinton location.   First off, the place is clean, immaculate, pretty, appealing to the eye, I'm impressed as soon as I walk in the door. Secondly, if you have not yet been to the Sandwich Box, YOU MUST GO!! You just must! It's THAT GOOD!   Onto the sandwiches! These gourmet sandwiches are like the best made to order sandwiches I've ever experienced, accompanied by the most exquisite choices of toppings!!!   The concept is delightfully simple, but variety is diverse and plentiful. You pick your bread, and I'm not talking white or wheat here folks, my choice was the \"rosemary foccacia\" (Yum-O!) Then you pick your spread, again, not just mayo, or mustard, I chose \"basil pesto\" ...aahhh!! (mouth watering, yet?? Huh?)   Next, you pick your meat, I chose the roasted chicken breast. And believe me, I was mighty fearful, coming from Subway and Quizno's that I was going to be sorely disappointed with some poor disgusting processed chicken crap that they try to pass off as meat...but oh no!! This was the real deal! Yippee!   After the meat, you pick your cheese and vegetables. You have the choice to forgo either and get 2 cheeses, and no veg OR no cheese, and 2 veg. But I was sold when I saw they had boccacini mozzarella!! So I chose that, along with some roasted red peppers, yummy.   They put in on the grill and brush some olive oil on top to make quite the nice little warmed grilled sandwich for you. After which, they pack it neatly in a little box with a small amount of spring mix on the side, which I thought was soooo considerate!! Everyone knows if you put lettuce on a sandwich and grill it or heat it, the lettuce wilts! (yuck!) So now you can take your sandwich, eat there or take away, and then assemble it with your fresh, and cold spring mix and still have the fresh, cold, bite from the crisp mix that they have provided for you!!! I thought that was the greatest idea!!! Huh?!?   As it turns out, that sandwich was so big, I actually got 2 meals out of it too! So I guess it depends how big your stomach and/or appetite is, because my girlfriend was with me, and she ate all of hers in one sitting.   So, in conclusion, I will be making another trip back to the Sandwich Box, probably within the week, they have definitely found a loyal customer in me. I think the sandwich was around $7.50, and totally worth it, as far as I'm concerned. And lastly, in my humble opinion, if you have not yet made it to a Sandwich Box, YOU MUST GO AND TRY!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality sandwiches.  Menu could use some more predefined combinations to make it easier to decide for people who don't have a need for everything custom."}
{"text":"While I can appreciate what people see in this place, I must say that I think there are better alternatives for the price.  Let me start with the good things:  - Amazing choice of breads - Ability to customize your own sandwich - Great spreads, toppings and cheeses  Now onto the bad: - For a small place that it occupies, it gets very busy at lunch, and as others mentioned, people start trippign over each other - The side salad could be improved. Currently it's basic greens with olive oil and balsamic vinegar - Limited selection of ingredients that can go into sandwich for price - There are better alternatives for the price  The place I personally enjoy visiting is Lettieri. For $10 you also get a combo of prepared panini and a side salad. You can't really customize the sandwich but the salad you get is MUCH better. It's probably easily 3-4 times the amount and there are actual ingredients like tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers etc.   This place looses some points for the business and price, the fact that you have choice and everything is fresh gives it 4 stars in my books."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here recently.  We met at 11:30 a.m. based on all of the commentary about the long lines.  It was empty at 11:30 a.m., which was perfect for us.    We decided on the customized fresh sandwiches.  I had roasted turkey, sun dried tomato pesto, caramelized onions and asiago cheese on potato bread.  The bread was my favourite part - nice and crunchy with big slices of potato baked right into to crust.  I was, however, a bit taken aback by the small size of the sandwich.  It really is like half a sandwich rather than a whole one.  It came in a sandwich box with a tossed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  Lunch ended up costing about $12 each.  I think it's a bit pricey for what you get.  That said, in downtown Toronto at lunch time, what do you expect.  I did like their seating - they had some tables outside on Richmond, so it was nice to enjoy the sunshine and warm breeze.  If I go back, I will try out their made-to-order salads.  From what I saw, the portions appeared to be quite hearty."}
{"text":"This particular Sandwich Box is about the size of a small walk in closet which isn't a bad thing if you get there before the lunch rush. With two cashes set up for sandwiches and salads things move along quickly enough.  There are plenty of toppings and combinations to choose from for both salad and sandwich but only two soup options. One is usually vegetarian if not vegan while the second choice will almost always have meat of some kind. From what I've seen they try and match soups up to the season with plenty of hearty thick soups and chowders in the colder months and lighter more refreshing ones in the summer.  If you don't have time or the patience to wade through all your options for a custom made salad you can grab pre-made salads or sandwiches at the front counter along with fruit juices or soft drinks. Jones Soda, Orangina and sparkling water are the typical offerings.  Prices vary but if you play it smart you can grab lunch for under $6. Don't be surprised to spend upwards of $15 if you're not careful in your choices."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last week.  I have been eating at Fast Fresh Foods for years, so was already familiar with the concept - fresh sandwiches and/or salads made to order, and quite like the options for fresh, healthy lunches.   I opted for a salad.  I liked that the Sandwich Box offers a few salad toppings not offered at other salad places in the Core - namely, lentils and cabbage.    The salads are priced by weight though - which makes it very difficult to know how much your salad is going to cost until you get to the cash (since somone else is making it for you).  I found that the person who served me really skimped on the toppings I chose.  Also found that some of the toppings weren't cut/chopped appropriately for a salad - for example - the red onion was in thick, full rings - since I do not normally eat my salad with a knife and fork (especially take-out salads), I found this to be inconvenient.   The almonds were not chopped, but rather were whole - but that is really a matter of personal preference.    My biggest issue though, is that the place is chaotic and an ordering nightmare.  The salad counter is tiny - there were two other people ordering at the same time as me, and none of us could see the toppings on offer, since we were all blocking each other's view of the counter.  There is no posted list of toppings.    My husband wanted to order one of the pre-made sandwiches, but couldn't figure out whether to pay first or order first.  And even after he did pay & order, it was unclear where he should pick up the order from.  The food was good, but I think I prefer the much easier and straightforward Fast Fresh Foods on Yonge."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, but the price ($10.74 incl tax) is steep.  I usually treat myself to a sandwich once every few weeks.  Side salad is good, I've never had a bad sandwich and side salad there.  TIP: some spreads (sundried tomato) could over take the flavour of the whole sandwich so I always ask them to put the spread on only one side/piece of bread."}
{"text":"Love this place, would recommend it to anyone. It is hands-down the best gourmet Sandwich place anywhere near the downtown core. I have tried similar offerings from Fresh West, Whole Foods, and several others and have been disappointed each time by their lack of flavour compared to SB.   Yes, you only get three toppings so with a meat and cheese selected you get just the one vegetable. I find this causes you to prioritize the truly important ingredients in your life and leaves your sandwich in a state where you can appreciate what you have put on there. It's not always about loading it up with everything available.   My favourite sandwich is Rosemary focaccia with avocado chipotle mayo, Turkey breast, and avocado. It's amazing. L  I find the price reasonable as the sandwich is filling, and it comes with a nice lightly dressed salad for $11. Lines can be long, especially in the summer. I'd recommend coming for an early lunch if possible to beat the rush."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go here for lunch at least once a week. Their concept is build-your-own sandwich or salad. They also have soups.  I've only had their sandwiches and soups.  It works really simple. You pick a bread, spread and then toppings for your sandwich. I try to make healthy sandwiches. Like multi-grain with avocado, tomato and cheese.  I usually don't do this, but they can also grill the sandwiches for you.  I love the build-your-own thing, but it might be a little overwhelming for some people. You have to make a lot of choices very quickly. Specially when in line during lunch rush-hour.  If you are in a less creative mood then you can also pick the special. Which is usually very tasty.  The sandwiches are only to go and come with a small salad on the side.  Their soups are also great. There usually is a veggie and non-veggie option. I often get a small soup."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are really quite good, but as Jordan T notes, you need to pay attention to the fact that only 3 toppings are included. This ain't Subway folks.  I had the salad at my most recent visit. It's weighed, so you need to keep that in mind in selecting your toppings. The problem/bonus is that they have really great toppings. I had a few scoops of quinoa, tofu, cherry tomatoes, corn, cuccumber and avocado with balsamic vinagrette. My salad came to $11.00. That's a bit pricey for my liking, but it was a pretty delicious salad."}
{"text":"I've been to Sandwich box a few times, usually on the insistence of my friends. Chicken Parm loves the Box, for sure. I must say, it's good, even great. Certainly, one of the best places to get a sandwich, especially a gourmet sandwich, in the city. I just feel it's a bit overrated.   Basically the concept is this: you pick the bread, you pick the meat, you pick the spread, you pick the toppings. Also, the bread, meat, spread and topping options are all of stellar quality. It's a simple and terrific concept and works very well. But...it's not very big and sometimes they're less than generous with the toppings.  I suppose the new location was chosen because it's meant to be larger but the way they've got things set up it seems as crowded as ever. Though now there are places to sit and eat which is a huge plus.   I'd give it 5 stars if it was either way bigger or way cheaper. Still, it's a great sandwich."}
{"text":"Solid four stars.  I went here on the advice of the all-powerful Yelp machine (ahem, other reviewers) and find it to be not only further from my office, but almost the exact same thing as Fresh, Food Fast.  (Is that the name? I can't be bothered to check in which order the Fs appear.) Anyway, I enjoyed my sandwich, but given the walk from work, I'll think I'll be passing this place up in the future in favor of the closer sandwich shop. If you work in the area, I would check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is my lunch haven and the sandwiches are to die for! The bread is delicious and the ingredients are extremely fresh. My personal favourite is the smoked salmon, roasted garlic paste, avocado and jalapeno havarti on an olive boule. They have a large variety of toppings and unique spreads and cheeses."}
{"text":"I don't give too many places the 5 star treatment but Sandwich Box has some of the best sammies in the city. This location, though extremely small (I've had bigger closets) boasts fresh ingredients and friendly staff - my most favourite combination.   The line up has never been long when I've gone in, regardless of the time. They pride themselves on being fast. They're very polite and really appreciate people who are polite back.  The Good:  1. Ingredients. They are always fresh and the bread is absolutely delicious (hand delivered ACE bread on the daily). 2. Staff. Friendly and always polite. Be sure to be polite back.   The Bad:  1. Size. It is extremely small. Do not go here expecting to sit down and eat - there are no tables! Strictly to go unlike other locations.  2. Price. And sandwich and basic side salad is $10.75 with tax. It's a bit pricey but ultimately I get my lunch here most always so obviously I've decided it's worth it. But I would find another place if you're looking for inexpensive.   Recommendation: the Rosemary focaccia bread and free range chicken breast."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, but giving the 3.  I did really like this location (and I LOVE their sandwiches), but all in all they have some improving to do. I'm not sure if this is a chain issue, or a franchise issue.   Pricing here is high for what you get. A sammy costs $11.75 with a tiny, basic salad on the side. You get selection of bread, spread, protein,and 2 additional toppings. Each additional topping after this is a whopping $1.50. And the toppings are skimpy and very limited.  The salads are where they really fail. They give an extremely low amount of greens to start off. This is surprising considering it's the cheapest item they put in it. You can then select from a long range of items to put in your salad - but be careful - instead of a fixed price, it's by weight. Most salads end up costing $10 and they are NOT filling.  The Good:  1. Taste. Everything is fresh and delicious (especially for the sandwich). 2. Bread. The bread is fresh from Ace Bakery. Need I say more?  The Bad:  1. Overpriced. The items, especially the salad, are high in price for what you are getting. 2. Tiny. This location is the tiniest hole in the wall I've ever been to! 3. Debit/Credit. There is a tip option on the debit credit machine which makes for an awkward interaction when you don't feel a tip is warranted. The food is already expensive enough without adding an extra 10-20% on top of it.  Recommendation: If you have a bit of extra money for lunch and want a healthy option, stop by here and try the rosemary focaccia bread."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends and i must admit, the sandwiches are pretty darn good. I also tried the blueberry danish and it was great also. Chill atmosphere, small and grab and go type place. Very clean and decorated nicely. You choose your own sandwich and what goes in it but it all sounds good. Great place."}
{"text":"I can't say I was too thrilled when my friend Stephanie told me that she was taking me to a place called the sandwich box, the place just didn't sound very sophisticated.  I've never been too inclined towards food stuffed between slices of bread, the idea just seems too lazy.  The menu was as foreign to me as the writings at Starbucks.  Gourmet names for stuff in containers, I didn't bother reading it..my pointing finger was good enough to direct the people behind the counter.  I got the smoked salmon with whatever bread I ordered, in some sauce I've never seen before.  The whole thing was too fancy for a place that served sandwiches, and called itself 'Box'.   There was a giant communal bench at the 'dine in' area with a giant bouquet of branches in the middle, so the anti-socials can hide behind it.  The idea is as dumb to me as having dividers split down a single toilet.  A huge canvas hung from the north wall with what looked like a giant broccoli painted from the puke of a hundred vegans.  What's the big idea?  First it's a sandwich store, then it's a trendy hipster diner, now it's a vegetarian gallery?  This place tries way too hard, I think they feel the pressure of setting up a location at Yorkville so they thought they'd pull out all the stops.   So let me make it loud and clear.....IT'S A SANDWICH STORE CALLED BOX..!!  The bread I ordered almost broke my jaw, I was constantly in fear of cutting my lip on the sandwich.  Stephanie was happy with her order because she didn't get bricks for bread.  There's a salad station which sells packaged salad...and a cooler with plenty of drinks that most people who don't drink garlic juice would have never heard of.  It's too much for sandwiches....too much.   I wonder what name they would have if they expanded their business?   Maybe; hotdog ball, salad cubicle, coffee bag....burger cup!"}
{"text":"I'd previously reviewed this place poorly. I have had a chance to revisit since then, and my opinion has definitely changed.  I can't speak for the regular sandwiches and the gluten-free bread is a disservice to the concept of a sandwich. HOWEVER, if you happen to be celiac/gluten-intolerant, the gluten-free wrap is the way to go. The veggies and meat are both delicious and I was allowed to pick a second vegetable since I skipped the cheese. Not sure if that is customary or a one-off.   A reasonable lunch spot so long as you know what to get!"}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy sandwich joint in Yorkville. Very busy at lunch, but they have a well-run operations that gets the line moving quickly. Looking at around $10-12 for a sandwich and a side salad."}
{"text":"Great model. Large selection of fresh breads and gourmet ingredients. For $7 you get to pick from a large selection of different breads, one of their spreads (sauces) and then three ingredients including vegetables, meats and mild to strong cheeses. To finish it off they grill the sandwiches in a press and then incude a green salad with balsamic dressing for a fantastic lunch. For the price you get quality ingredients such as sweet red peppers, portobello mushrooms, avocado etc...  These are the sandwiches you wish the ones you make at home look and taste like."}
{"text":"Tried their online ordering and it did not work. Then had to spend the time redoing it and still got no final price. After emailing to confirm, they then cancelled my order at the last minute after I stated I would not email them my credit card information. I stated that asking for credit card info over email is not secure and to please provide me an invoice for my order and then call me and I would happily give them a credit card number. Instead less than 12 hours before my catering order was to be delivered they cancelled it saying they were too busy!  Worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"Good quality, choose-your-own-ingredients. Sandwiches and salads.  Make sure you tell them whether you want a side-salad or not, b/c if you say anything they add it by default."}
{"text":"$10 salad. No meat. Food poisoning. Woof.  Sandwiches looked good."}
{"text":"used to grab take-out (because it was impossible to snag a table) for lunch when i used to work downtown. the customization is great, but their preset sandwiches are also pretty dang dynamite.  this place rivals petit four for fav sandwich joints in the financial district."}
{"text":"For my healthy health food seeker friends, vegetarians, and vegans alike. I think I found a spot where we can all meet up for lunch. Thank GOD!  Located just east of Yonge and Eglinton this little spot is busy busy pumping out the triple S (Soup, Salad, and Sandwiches) every day. But which direction will you go? Left for a Sandwich and soup, right for a salad?   Yesterday I opted for a little re-LEAF and ordered a custom salad with all-a-yall fixings. If memory serves me correctly I added: egg, chicken, chick peas, carrots, shredded apples with mustard seeds, blue cheese, Strawberries, croutons and Citrus dressing to my Spinach greens. What a creative little guy I am! It was delicious and the perfect amount to fill my hunger gap (however at first glance it appeared very small).  I can't speak to the soup and sandwiches but they seemed to be popular with the in and out crowd (more so than the salad side of things) - I bet it was because your custom salad is charged by weight. My creation came out to nearly $12...over $15 with a drink and tax. Kinda pricey for what you get, I mean it's salad folks....the most expensive item i put in there was the 1/4-1/2 breast of chicken and the boiled egg.  Will I return? Ya sure, but keep in mind there are dozens of places just like it all over the city, some charging less for much much more."}
{"text":"Making your own sandwich has never been more delicious. You can pick between a wide variety of fresh bread, spreads (my favourite is avocado mayo), meat, and cheese. Always put both olive oil and lemon in your sandwich! It may feel a little greasy to eat, but it tastes great. The sandwiches are on the salty side, so you can always hold on the salt when they ask.  Compared to other yorkville sandwich places, it's at a pretty decent price ($10 for a sandwich and a small salad on the side). Completely worth it, especially if you know exactly what you're craving. I'm curious to try the other types of sandwiches as well.   There aren't many seats to this place, for the most part it seems the lunchtime crowd takes their food to-go."}
{"text":"Working in the Spadina and Adelaide area, I am always flooded with endless options for lunch. (I should really bring my lunch and save some dough but alas, I'm just not that prepared!). I frequently venture to Sandwich Box during my lunches and I am yet to be disappointed.   Their soups are always fresh and are changed up everyday. You have the option of grabbing an already prepared sandwich / salad or making your own. For the sandwiches, you have so many different bread options. Then you choose your spread, your meat, veggie and your cheese. You can add salt and pepper and then they put it in a Panini grill. Delish.   As for the salads, you choose what type of lettuce and then you add your toppings.. the sky is the limit on what they have but beware that you pay by weight so tread with caution on what you add!  I have ended up with a great $7 salad and an ok $14 in the past!  It's a small space so it's not for the Claustrophobic peeps but the close encounters with strangers is well worth it."}
{"text":"I had the spicy salami sandwich with pesto and red peppers on foccacia.  The bread was soft, the salami had the right amount of heat that was not overwhelming.  The salad had a bit of dressing but it was not overpowering.  The customer service was so horrendous, it motivated me to write this.  It got worse as you go down the line.  The servers have no clue what they have and they aren't engaging.  You're supposed to get a choice of soup and salad, but we were not asked our choice.  The cashier was the worst - He tried to charge me full price for an express sandwich, then switched my correct order with the wrong order.  I would have been okay with the wrong order if he didn't say \"wait!\" after I paid as if I was a criminal.  Eventually I got the right order, after the cashier argued with me and the staff corrected him.  He said \"here you are\" and I walked away saying nothing to him.  No apology, no recognition that what happened.  This isn't something I can overlook, and thus I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Looking for a Sandwich place that is different, cutting edge and makes your taste buds melt?  Well this is not your place!  I'm going to continue with my overtime take out review series with Sandwich Box.  You would think making a sandwich is probably not the most complicated task out there, but this place seems to get it all wrong.    My order consisted of an egg salad sandwich on whole grain bread with a side salad.  When I received it, I only got the sandwich and the restaurant failed to tell me the salad was no longer included in the combo (yet the price remained the same).  That's great that the online menu was not updated to include items no longer available, a simple update would address all these problems knowmsayin?  Now on to the actual sandwich, the bread was thick.  I mean so thick it looked like there was about a half an inch of eggs inside of two encyclopedias worth of bread.  The eggs themselves, totally flavorless and bland.  Kinda hard to mess up an egg salad sandwich right?  Even Tim Horton's can get that right!  To make things short and sweet, I'll be looking over this option the next time I'm working late or considering a sandwich in the downtown area."}
{"text":"I have to admit I am a fan of this place.  Although in order for me to be a fan I always look for value and I just think that this place is a bit on the high side for a quick sandwich and a drink.  So I looked past the $ because the food is on the high side.  The ingredients used are not your everyday item and I do give them credit for the creativity with their menu.  I never knew thay had the quick lunch menu, credit to Terry P. for mentioning that.  I guess I should start reading more and less salivating.  I think I will give the cheaper set lunch sandwich a try today.  =o)   Yummm!"}
{"text":"It's a custom fancy sandwich bar which is absolutely rammed at lunch time. Came here last week for a quick take away bite. Got a brie, Carmelizes onion and some sort of protein I can't remember. Came with a small side salad. Its an extra 1.50 for each topping. Subway this ain't. Didn't end up sitting down because we couldn't find a seat. It's a okay joint not sure If it beats the 4$ sub of the week, especially if it's sweet onion chicken teriyaki."}
{"text":"Overall a great fast-food place."}
{"text":"They serve fresh sandwiches with good quality ingredients. They have a variety choices for protein and vegetables and cheese. And also have wonderful coffee!!\""}
{"text":"I came here to purchase a salad and wasn't too impressed. The lady working was nice but they really didn't explain how it worked. I felt like a lost puppy dog when I first walked in as I didn't know where to go to place my order. They have two counters within the restaurant.   Product Knowledge? The employees have no idea which meats are gluten free, since everything is made off site. I stuck to the ingredients that looked like they had no add-on ingredients.  While dining, I noticed most people order their sandwiches which are about half the price of what I paid. The salads aren't priced but they are weighed. I had the employee add the ingredients I wanted and when she weighed my salad, I was shocked to discover my salad cost $17 at a fast food joint.   This restaurant looks nicer than what you would find in the food court but considering all the food is made off site, I am surprised my salad would cost so much.   I chose the lime salad dressing and it made my salad way too citrus flavoured. I could barely eat it, so I asked for some honey mustard to decrease the acidity of the dressing and the employee gave me one teaspoon. I wasn't really impressed with how stingy they were over a teaspoon of mustard.  Allover, I didn't really enjoy my salad and I don't think I'll be returning to this location. I know Freshii would have remade my salad if I had any problems with my salad but the employees didn't offer me any solutions when I said it was too citrus. It's hard to believe they didn't even want to give me a teaspoon of mustard to help the situation.   Would I return? It's not likely unless it was a life or death situation."}
{"text":"I come here to eat when I'm either shopping on Bloor street or after the gym and want something light and healthy. The two or three times that I have come here, I always bumped into a celebrity, its pretty cool. This place is conveniently beside Bay station and infront of a bus stop. When I walk in, I always love seeing this great huge painting, complimenting the huge wooden seating area. To order, you pick your bread, what you want in it and so forth which really help if your picky or on a diet. I normally get roman honey grain bread, avacado & chipotle spread, salmon, provolone, roasted red peppers/eggplant with a splash of lemon, olive oil and a little ground pepper. Once you have customized your sandwhich, they warm it up almost like a panini. I make my way over to the self serve soup area and grab a cup of \"the soup of the day\" and put corn and sautéed onions in it, its delicious! The sandwhich comes with a side of green salad, which is a little too acidic for me but the soup neutralizes my taste buds. I've had a couple friends complaining how expensive this place is but I really enjoy eating here and will pay any price for great food!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and salads. However, they charge extra for the most ridiculous things I.e (75 cents for a slice of bread with your salad, and charging you if you want a different type Of lettuce with your sandwich)"}
{"text":"i work next door and i've only been here once before today because it's so bad. go to sandwich box if you want to pay $11 for what's essentially airplane food."}
{"text":"I'm fairly mad that I actually like this place because I can make likely the EXACT same thing for a fraction of the price. But what can i say?  It's delish and why make it when I can somebody else to schlep on my fave gourmet ingredients and then press the whole thing to make it warm and nummy.  big fan of the olive bread (how can you say no to that?)  go here if you just don't feel like makin your own damn sandwhich."}
{"text":"I love Sandwich Box.  Most people have already spoke to how the system works, so I'll explain why this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 (even though I LOVE their sandwiches at the 5 star level).  1. When they're busy at lunch, they won't nickel and dime you for every topping.  There have been a few occasions where they've charged the regular price.  On the flip side, if you come here at 3pm on a Saturday, every single item you pick is going to get charged and these can quickly add up.  You have been warned.  2. The potential for a bad sandwich.  It is high.  You see all these delicious toppings that you love and they may not all go together.  Today, you're feeling giddy for Apple Curry spread but want eggplant and avocado and arugula.  And then you get the sandwich and think, this sandwich I made?  It sucks.  And I have no one to blame but myself.  Contemplate your toppings.  3. Sometimes, their salads have way too  much dressing on them.  There's nothing like a soggy salad to compromise your glorious sandwich.  4. On 2 separate occasions, they have forgotten about my sandwich and burnt the living daylights out of it.  They fixed it both times by providing me with new bread but it took way long.  Word to the wise: watch your sandwich to ensure it is appropriately toasted and not left to crisp itself to oblivion on that grill.  Overall, I really like going to this place.  I love my meal 90% of the time.  And usually, when I don't like it I screwed it up myself by getting too creative."}
{"text":"I like this place, but it certainly loses stars because the sandwich and salad makers can't seem to hear your order well - you have to repeat things several times if you want the the right thing(s).  They also don't understand the concept of, say, half the amount of dressing for salads or if you don't want salt and/or pepper on your food.  Perhaps Sandwich Box should consider order forms!!!"}
{"text":"Noticed almost an entire staff change during yesterday's visit. Refreshing to observe an employee actually taking the time to examine the sandwiches to ensure they were toasted properly."}
{"text":"I pretty much eat there everyday...! They should have a buy 10 get 1 free promotion like freshii!"}
{"text":"This place is SO BUSY but they have mastered the artistry of sandwiching!  I came here with a friend during the lunch rush and it is an overwhelming experience: packed full of people, lots of selection and is a fast-paced, build your own sandwich machine.  Confusing part: there is one line for salads, then another line for soups, then another line for sandwiches.  No one knew who was ordering, paying and waiting for their sandwiches.  You get to choose one bread, one spread, then 3 toppings (only 1 meat topping - I tried to swing 2 but that was extra).  I got the TRIANGLE BUN, with the PESTO BASIL spread, with PROSCIUTTO and AVOCADO, and CARAMELIZED ONIONS.  It was deee-licious, could have used more flavor (ie salt) but that may just be me.  It's more of a gourmet sandwich that you can build yourself, very popular amongst the working crowd.  Lots of young professionals go there to grab a quick sandwich on the go.    PS - it's a bit of a meat market there too (no pun intended), I got picked up 3 times, so go there if you want to find a date!!  Haha!"}
{"text":"Every sandwich that this place makes is to die for!  I plan my client meetings around the lunch hour so I can pop in here afterward for a nice smoked salmon/pesto/avocado sandwich.  Yum!  The sandwiches are a bit pricey but worth every penny!  :)"}
{"text":"This place is located just north of Yonge and Bay street and has two kiosks/stations.  One is called Cafe Au Moi and the other one is called Sandwich Box.    I ordered a vegan sandwich on vegan bread (they only have one type of vegan bread) though I'm sure others were and the guy making the sandwiches just wasn't sure.   Each sandwich box is around $10 and comes with a side salad.  I also ordered a side soup with it. The total was $14 including tax, which is an okay price, but I think it could have been better value.    What I like: -Three types of vegan spreads - hummus, sundried tomato and curried apple.   -A lot of fresh and grilled veggies to choose from.   -It's healthy  What I didn't like: -The vegan sandwich was very small.  It's probably the size of 1/2 a panini. It may be enough for a small eater, but if I didn't order the soup, I probably would have been starving (granted I eat a lot, but regardless, I don't see it as a full meal).    Verdict: It's a good healthy alternative, but pricey.  I might be back if I don't want to deal with the lines at Salad Days."}
{"text":"I come here frequently.  Sandwiches are above average.  I can come in and expect the usual.  It's not cheap.  Nothing grandiose to say.  It's a simple franchise that seems to have integral morality.  The servers aren't particularly friendly but the service is good.  to be honest I don't understand why I would be tipping for a cafeteria setup.  I find that to be unjust, especially because there's no cleanup and people just hand you food at the cash.  If they want to pay the employs better they shouldn't have a tipping option they should just include in their hourly or a bonus.  Overall decent and will.come back by the food quality is good."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's pricey- but a great indulgence from time to time.  I've tried to master me favourite sandwich and nothing I can do even comes close to comparing!  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I've been there a few times just after the lunch rush (I'd say at about 1pm or so- which should still technically be lunchtime) and they've run out of ingredients.  I have a perfect sandwich that I always get, and even pay the extra money for the extra toppings, and when they run out of breads or certain veggies- it throws off the entire thing.  Still tastes good, but definitely not AS good.  They just need to prepare themselves a little bit more.  Salads are wonderful too, but can also be pricey depending on how much you put in it!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches in a cool atmosphere. Pick between upwards of 7 different types of bread, spreads, vegetables, meat, and cheese for one flat price (pick 1 from each category).  If you come here around noon, expect a line and you may have difficulty getting seating."}
{"text":"I wish I could afford to eat this every day! Amazing choice. I wish they hadn't closed the Yonge and Eglinton location."}
{"text":"It is dangerous that this place is so close to my apartment. This, ladies and gents, is one delicious sandwich. The roast beef with caramelized onion and provolone on baguette was amazingly delicious -- the beef was tender, and what bad could possibly be said about caramelized onions? NOTHING, that's what! Caramelized onions are always good! And having it all toasted and melty-tasty sent me over the moon. The sandwich was accompanied by a lightly dressed mixed green salad, which makes the somewhat spendy price a little bit less of a blow.   Not much room to eat inside this location, so you're best getting your sammy to go."}
{"text":"I have worked nearby for years and have never ventured here.  I recently gave it a try about a month ago and have been back almost daily since.  They really do make a delicious sandwich.  I agree with a previous reviewer - contemplate your toppings!    I tried a roast beef sandwich on my first visit and it was TERRIBLE.  the beef was practically raw.  yuck.    My next visit - I tried the chicken breast.  Real chicken, can't go wrong.  My favorite sandwich is Chicken breast on potato foccacia with garlic/cumin mayo, provolone and arugula.  It is delicious.  Don't bother with the soup at this place - it's nothing more than an afterthought."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to grab a quick lunch. The sandwiches are tasty and interesting but not out of this world. Fresh mostly but the value is lacking. Making a sandwich isn't rocket science and over $10 for a simple sandwich and drink is a bit much considering the ingredients. Overall this place reminds me of the prete-a-manger places...not great value but a fresh sandwich when you didn't have time to pack one for yourself."}
{"text":"A delicious little sandwich shop, these guys have the market cornered on quality and speed.  Always lined up around lunch, you'll come to find that a blessing as you stare at your delicious options and make the impossible decision of only have 5 pieces to your sandwich.  You choose your bread, spread, meat, cheese and vegetable and are never let down.  Your sandwich comes (in a box!.. and:) with a side salad.  You might think to yourself \"just a sandwich and this salad and that's it?\" but the meal is surprisingly filling.    The layout of this store is a bit confusing for first timers.  You'll see a cash register by the door, but that's not where you order your sandwich.  In fact, if you order a fresh sandwich (which you should) you won't even be paying at this register.  Delve into the deeper reaches of the store, and you'll see the line-up that hairpins towards the counter.  This is where you order."}
{"text":"Its all about fresh and local ingredients at the sandwich box, though if you're not careful this place can put a hole in your wallet lol... $10 for Sandwich hmm. however again you can't put a pricetag on some sexy fine foods. a coworker highly recommended this place so we had a team outing last week Thursday.  Simple menu broken down into 4-5 categories....Choose one ingredient from each category to make your sandwich, from type of \"Bread,Meat, Vegetable, Sauce, etc\"  In no time your cute box comes with a serving of arugla salad to compliment your meal.   My sandwich consisted of \"Potato Panini, smoked chicken, eggplant, garlic/ cumin spread, and goatcheese\"...and it was SO YUM! sometimes you just got to GO WILD with their ingredients, and get out of your culinary comfort zone to appreciate its flavored versatility. Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"I am a Sandwich Box virgin no more! Thank you Carolyn B. for deflowering my SB virginity. It was lots of fun to meet up with you on Richmond Street and indulge in one of the best sandwich spots I've been to in a long, long time. I'm a girl who loves my sandwiches (Reggies, the Stockyards, Caplansky's) but there is definitely room in my sandwich loving life for the Sandwich Box.   So, it's pretty simple. You pick a bread/bun. You pick a condiment. You pick a meat. You pick a cheese. You pick another filling. They slap it together, whack it on the panini griller and off you go. The sandwich gets plopped into a eco-friendly paper box with a small green leafy salad beside it.   The good is that the SB uses both Fred's Breads and Ace. So the base of what they start with has quality, good flavour and substance. They offer interesting combos with lots of choices of spreads so you could probably eat a sandwich here every day for the next year and never have the same thing twice. I opted for a onion foccacia with a mustard spread, prosciutto, brie cheese and caramelized onions (I'm having a big onion moment here!). It was really great.   The downside was that the side salad wasn't really dressed enough so it was a bit dry and using only mesclun greens it was slightly bitter.  The other downside is that the lineups/cash register get confusing. One place for soup. One place for sandwiches. One place for salads. I must say though I was totally impressed with the salad bar. Lots and lots of choices, all very fresh and all very spotlessly clean.  I'll definitely be back!   The real upside of this lunch was finally getting a chance to meet my fellow Yelptress, the lovely Carolyn B. T'was a pleasure my dear. :)"}
{"text":"Having sandwiches for lunch goes back to the days of sitting in the school cafeteria and eating the crappy luncheon meat sandwich for the 4th time this week.  Let me tell you that Sandwich Box will not conjure up those horrid memories of school sandwiches. With 5-6 choices for bread, spread, meat, vegetables there are basically an infinite combination of choices that you can have. And oh boy are all of the choices so darn good. Everything is so fresh and flavourable that it's almost impossible to go wrong.  One thing that I will warn you is that you need to get there early. Get there before the rush if you want choose your bread. Otherwise you'll be stuck with whatever is left (still good but you're missing out) since things move pretty quickly at lunch time.  And as Phil S. said, I am also concerned about how fast SB is growing. Although sandwiches are a pretty simple formula, it's easy to imagine that as more locations open, the quality will suffer. Let's hope that this doesn't happen to Sandwich Box."}
{"text":"The potato focaccia will change your life!   It's hard not to get overwhelmed with the choices...so many delicious potential sandwich combos. My personal favourite is pesto, brie, tomato and turkey. The salad on the side is a nice touch. Yes, the sandwiches are $10, but once you taste the melting brie, you will forget any qualms you may have had about the price.  I've also tried the salad bar and the soup. Both are decent, but it's called Sandwich Box for a reason.    One last tip: don't plan to dine-in...the place is usually packed from 11am-1:30pm and it's tough to find a table."}
{"text":"Tasty and delicious sandwiches! On the pricey side but I keep going back when I can't decide what I'm grabbing for lunch and I'm looking for a more healthy alternative. I can't judge their salads, I've only ordered the sandwiches which are made right in front of you then toasted on a panani grill. It comes with a simple mixed green salad dressed in very light dressing. I wouldn't go everyday just because it is $$. But a great place to have around."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend during lunch so wanted to fit this within the one hour window to get back to my desk and continue spinning the hamster wheel. The line was small but was moving at snail speed. I found the menu and the ordering to be confusing for some reason. The sandwich crust was hard and gave me a stomach ache afterwards (a day before my CFA exam so had me concerned). My friend said she noticed the same. Might not go again."}
{"text":"Custom, made to order sandwiches and salads! I had the white panini with arugula, caramelized onions, grilled zucchini, sundried tomato spread, and goat cheese - delicious! It comes with a side salad, which is nice. They also have an express menu, if you don't have time to wait in line for a custom sandwich. Overall, a good place to get a sandwich or salad!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite downtown places. A million possible combinations, my current tasty creation has the rosemary focaccia and the basil pesto spread, grilled chicken for the meat topping with goat cheese and avocado. Add a little oil and s & p, toast it for a bit and voilà! Comes with a small simple greens salad for a taste of healthy. Usually comes in under $10. There's several daily soup specials, a salad bar and a pre-made sandwich list for a quick pickup. Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Great selection of sandwiches and salads, everything is made custom so you can pick all your bread, toppings, etc.   Salads you pay for by weight, so my complaint is that the price varies so much that it's impossible to predict how much you will be paying. One day $6, the next day $13.   There is one big communal table here so it's not a good place to sit and eat, best take your lunch back to the office. Extremely long lines if you arrive between 12:15-1pm."}
{"text":"I tried Sandwich Box for lunch while at a conference across the street. I went at noon and it was packed. I ordered whole wheat bread with pancetta, arugula, caramelized onions, brie, and sun dried tomato spread. It came with a side salad which was had a light dressing (~$11/$12). I also tried the water with fruit ($1). It's great that the money from the water sales goes to Sick Kids Hospital. Everything was really good. My only complaint was the bread. It was way too hard. Other than that, all the toppings were fresh and it took about 5 minutes to make. The place has a few tables and it's really nice because the doors/windows are open so you can enjoy the fresh air. Overall, a good place to get a quick bite."}
{"text":"I quite like Sandwich Box as a chain. I used to live near the one at Yonge & Eglinton, I worked near the one in the Financial District and, as luck would have it, I go to school near the one on Bay.  Christine R. offers a very helpful overview of how it works.  The salads are always a good option, and because of how you are charged, you always get what you want. Often, though, I go for a sandwich--because there's only so much Subway one can take between classes.  I like the whole grain panini, and my sandwich usually has the following: often grilled chicken, but sometimes roast beef; bocconcini or jalapeno havarti; red peppers or eggplant; with the avocado & chipotle, or basil, or sundried tomato spread. I tend to order some combination of these at any Sandwich Box location.  The Bay St outlet, however, is distinct from the rest. I find that the people there are very stingy with the toppings, and quite careless in spreading them out across the bread. The result is a sandwich that has several bites of just bread with spread on it. They slice the chicken very thinly, which makes for poorer value that I would expect after enjoying the Y&E and Financial District sandwiches. And, I am always a bit weirded out when I see them use a knife to cut my sandwich after cutting someone else's. If I were a vegan--to whom this chain appears actively to target--this would really bother me. As it stands, I simply pay attention to how the knives are being used ahead of me, and ask for a clean knife if I have an allergy concern or anticipate flavour or cross-contamination issues. (I realize that this may sound crazy, and that I might be horrified by what goes on in back-room kitchens, but there's something to be said for 'out of sight, out of mind'... and, anyway, my local Subway outlet tends to be much more careful with knives/cross-contamination than Sandwich Box.)  Overall, I value the variety, but I won't miss the Bay St Sandwich Box when school is done. I'll be happy with the more generous sandwiches and better value at the other Sandwich Box outlets."}
{"text":"CLOSED.  THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED. They didn't pay their rent and they have been evicted. This happened a few months ago. For some reason, it is not updated anywhere - including on the Sandwich Box website.  The phone number used to be: 416-488-2300. It is disconnected."}
{"text":"I like the baguette with chili & lemon mayo, pepper-crusted turkey, goat cheese, roasted red peppers and a little of their chili sauce. Stay away from their roast beef as it's hard to chew."}
{"text":"Decent sandwich place, but pricey for what you're getting. They have a wide variety of meat and veggie options, as well as different types of bread. The sandwiches taste good, but come at a steep price. The side salads included with the sandwiches tend to be a bit on the bland side (maybe I just need to ask for more dressing). Decent place for a healthy lunch.  I think Fast. Fresh. Food. does the same concept, but for a more reasonable price (you get more toppings too). Personally, I prefer that over Sandwich Box."}
{"text":"What hits the spot for me at the Sandwich Box is the selections of sauces they have available for their sandwiches. I've been here a few times and whenever I do, I always ask for the truffle sauce which is amazing. Another thing I like is how customizable the sandwiches are! Do note that it is on the pricey side for a sandwich so I don't make it a habit to come here too often."}
{"text":"Not cheap, but good.    I gave this restaurant a try after seeing the ratings on Yelp, and because I've grown hopelessly bored of PATH takeout food.  I took my friend yesterday, and we both ended up having the same thing - #2 toasted ciabatta bread with goat cheese, basil, pesto and portabello mushrooms.  It came in a cardboard box and also had a side salad with a light dressing.  The cost was about $7.50 per person.  While the sandwich turned out to be outstanding and full of taste, the restaurant itself was INSANELY busy.  When we arrived there appeared to be 2-3 lineups plus milling crowds.  Since we had never been there before we were initially confused where to order.  The clientele seems to be mostly Bay Street types who will be using their Blackberries simultaneously while ordering/eating.  Our order was prepared fairly quickly - as we selected something from their Express Menu of about 8 different sandwiches listed on a blackboard.  We also saw them preparing salads, and custom sandwiches - but with the huge crowds, I didn't think it was prudent to venture into that realm just yet.  It bares mentioning that my favorite thing about this restaurant, aside from the great taste of the sandwich itself, was the abundance of  fresh and healthy ingredients.  We truly need more restaurants like this in place of McDonald's or Wendy's.  Loses a point for busyness factor.  Not a fault of the restaurant, but something to take into consideration if you plan on visiting."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place, and stop by at least once a week for lunch.  It is quite popular among the Yonge and Eglinton lunch crowd.  You basically have your choice of a salad bar or a customized sandwich.  All ingredients are premium, with your choice of about 8 different breads (whole grain panini is my favorite), 6 or 8 spreads (I like the olive spread), 6 cheeses or so, a variety of high quality meats, and plenty of good veggies such as portobello, caramelized mushrooms, eggplant, roasted peppers, etc.  For $7.95 you get a spread and your choice of three toppings - most people pick a meat, a cheese, and a veggie, but you can do it however you want.  The sandwich is served with a mixed green salad which is a nice touch.  The salad bar also has high quality ingredients. You start by choosing your greens and then the staff will add whatever you want.  They have ham and chicken, beans, chickpeas, nuts, strawberries, dried cranberries, olives and of course the regular assortment of tomato, cucumber, carrot, peppers, etc.  There is a wide variety of salad dressings.  When you are done, they weigh your salad and charge you by weight.  Be prepared - it is easy to end up with a $9 - $11 salad if you add a lot of stuff.  They also have an 'express sandwich' at lunch time, which is a different sandwich every day that they have pre-made but still grill fresh for you.  It saves a couple minutes and $1 off the price.  The place is clean and bright and the staff are always friendly.  The prices are a little bit high, but you get what you pay for, and this is good stuff."}
{"text":"Extremely crowded, especially during lunch break - their work flow is very weird and doesn't really make sense  Some people get their orders right away, but other people end up waiting a really long time for no reason. It gets insanely hectic during lunch and you can see many people getting very frustrated that their order isn't coming through.   The concept is awesome - the food is always delicious, and their salad bar is very extensive. However, 10$ for a sandwich is pretty steep, especially for a daily lunch break. Would come here occasionally for a treat, but the lunch rush is not something to be underestimated."}
{"text":"Mmm... Sandwich Box sandwiches are certainly tasty, with high quality ingredients. Even their simple side salad, which is nothing but leafy greens and balsamic vinaigrette seems to taste better when I make the same thing at home. They spread the bread with olive oil and grill it for every sandwich...yum!  Service is not the fastest, so you will have to wait a bit if you're in a rush.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it is pricey. They do have a daily special for $7.95 which is a bit cheaper, but normally their sandwich combos are $8.95.   I normally eat at the location in the RBC Plaza Food Court. Not sure if there should be a separate listing for that?"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch.  Been wanting to try this place out for awhile, was eyeing the one on Adelaide, but now that I'm at Yonge and Eglinton this place is right by my work!  Seriously, this would've helped me while I was on my vegan diet, tons of yummy vegan options here.  Basically a create-your-own sandwich/salad place... kind of like Subway but completely taken up several notches.  Today I got a Yukon Potato Foccaccia sandwich with hummus, avocadoes, portabello mushroom and boccacini and it comes with a side salad.  Looking forward to trying the salad option next time.  The combinations are endless, don't think I could ever get bored of this place... I'd probably go broke before that happens though.  The only downside I can see is that they don't have grilled pineapples as a topping choice and no seating.  It's strictly a take-out place, hence the name."}
{"text":"Having grown up in the 80's, I have an affinity toward certain things; hound's tooth high tops, turquoise eyeliner, and most of all salad bars.  Now I don't know what evil person decided to strip the world of these Edenic, unlimited, food gardens in the nineties but I am glad they are making a come back.  Don't let it's Carbocentric name fool you, the sandwich box is not just made to order Sammies; actually, it is the best of the salad places that have been popping up in this city lately.  It's not like the old days though (none of the salad joints are), not everyone can stick her grubby hands into the variety of fresh ingredients arranged so perfectly in front of the eyes.  The Sandwich box gives you a choice of greens and you pick from a wonderful variety of ingredients - various seeds, cheeses, artichokes heart of palm, beets, egg, tofu, chicken, etc.  Everything is weighed up and voila, health in a bowl.    A word to the wise: the prices do run a little high, so if you are on a tight budget, it's best to stick to the lighter weight ingredients."}
{"text":"WHOO-HOO. I wasn't expecting this place to be THAT good. It's a basic take-out salad, sandwich and soup place, and everything smells, looks and tastes awesome.   I had a crazy do-it-yourself salad, big, fulfilling, tasty, and - better! - cheap! I'd eat at this place every single day!"}
{"text":"This popular chain is just ok for me. As a vegetarian the sandwich options are lacking so I really only ever eat the salads and soups. The ingredients are fresh and you can make your own salad with lots to choose from but the dressings are a bit bland. My biggest beef is that it's over-priced. They charge by weight of the salad which I find odd because I begin to think of what things weigh more than what I'd like in my salad.   Lots of my friends and even my pre-veggie self say the sandwiches are pretty good and come with a nice side salad - the bread is basted in olive oil and nicely grilled so I guess if you're a sandwich fiend you might give a higher rating to this chain.  My tip - go for the pre-made section: the pre-made caesar is good because it's got WAY more lettuce in it than if you just have them make you one, the mediterranean salad is delicious and they have chicken versions as well. You can ask them to toss it for you too and sometimes you get a bit of extra dressing that way too. All for about $5-6 - a good deal if you ask me.  The pre-made sandwiches are a bit bland (egg and tuna but in a rush I get those too) - and they only cost $5-6. The soup is ok, there's a vegan and meat one each day - probably just pureed what was going bad in their inventory but that's ok, its hot and cheap.   i know I'm pretty spoiled with lunch options in my area so this place is ok once in a while but its certainly not a favourite."}
{"text":"We need to have this sandwich chain in the US. Totally gives Panera a run for their money. My sandwich was turkey, avocado, and brie on rosemary focaccia bread. It was awesome and I can't wait to go back tomorrow to try another combination."}
{"text":"I spend way, way too much money here. Every. Single. Workday. It's actually kind of embarrassing, since I am clearly not an investment banker and I could very well make my own salad.  But it's so easy and so healthy! I've never created the same salad twice. Today it was quinoa, sweet green peas, beets, avocado, and cherries with a lemon ginger dressing.  Tomorrow I am thinking spinach with lentils, chicken, some sundried tomatoes and marinated mushrooms with red wine dijon. Yeah....  The soups are delicious, too, and there's always a gluten free option.  Suggestions for the owners:  - Learn feng shui. The sandwich line and the salad line converge like two angry rivers. This layout has people tripping and shoving their way to the cash registers then awkwardly dodging toward the exit from 11AM - 2PM.  - They really should consider some loyalty cards for the $$ dropped."}
{"text":"This is the type of place I like to hunt for when i'm in the mood for a sandwich.  It's filling, it's customizable and it's close to the office. It's clear that there is a while process for this place when you enter and it could be a bit confusing. but once you get a handle on it, it works really well. I will say, the set up for the line to order could be better, but there are worse things to worry about in this world.  This is a great stop for lunch, you should swing by too."}
{"text":"They use good-quality ingredients and you can pick and choose whatever you put in your sandwich, so there's not much to dislike except for maybe the price. It's pretty much the perfect place to go for a lunch break, in and out really quick and the sandwich tastes great.  I recommend trying their avocado for your \"vegetable\" selection, it was delicious (my standards for avocados are quite high so I was mildly surprised at how good it was)."}
{"text":"Pricey - yes, but worth it.  The salads i feel are a bit of a rip off, but the sandwiches are more worth it.  Essentially, for a lunch sandwich and garnish salad, you're look at 10-12 bux.   So is it worth it? yes, only because they are using fresh, premium ingredients, and you are the master of your own destiny here - you design what you're going to eat.   The two best ingredients i come back here for: olive bread and roasted egg plants. Spreads also include an olive tepenade.   Special good thing that i like, they serve san pelligrino oranciata here."}
{"text":"I'm pretty torn between 3* and 4*.  I would really like to give it 3.5 if possible.  Since I'm the first to review, I'll give it a 4 :D   Supposedly, this place opened fairly recently, and my GF took me here because she told me that she has it for lunch rather frequently and she likes it more than Freshii.  I was fairly impressed with their selection of toppings.  It's still a distance away from gourmet, but it is also miles ahead of fast food venues like Subway.  I ordered a spinach salad, and was pleased to find out that they were organic.  Tossed the salad with an egg, chicken, avocado, sliced almonds and a bunch of other toppings with balsamic vinaigrette: it was delicious.  The whole thing was $11-12, which I thought was well worth it."}
{"text":"It may have been because TIFF was going on, but when I walked into Sandwich Box for the first time, they were out of almost half the ingredients on their menu.  Despite the difficulty with which I was able to identify the ingredients still available, I sassily combo'ed a portobello mushroom, zucchini sandwich on rosemary foccaccia with sundried tomato paste.  Well, sass aside, this was the best sandwich served to me while I was in Toronto and satisfied my appetite before standing in a 3 hour rush line at TIFF.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"At $8 for a sandwich it slightly on the expensive side, but we enjoyed them none the less.   You are able to choose from several different types of breads, spreads, meats and veggies. One of each is included.   The topping were far from overflowing, but the sandwich was a decent size and came with a small salad in the box which we weren't expecting.   The store is a bit small with a few tables off to the side. If they were any more busy we would have had to go elsewhere to eaten our sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place rocks!   My good friend took me here to grab some lunch and a hot beverage to catch up over.   This place honestly has an excellent selection of options of how to build the perfect sandwich (bonus: comes with a mixed green salad on the side w/ purchase).   You get to choose your bread, protein, cheese, veggies, and sauce/spread and you can also get it toasted. I was really impressed with the variety of ingredients that you could choose from.   +++ The service was great!   I will be coming back for sure to make another great creation in the very near future."}
{"text":"Service is rushed and cold, but they get the job done.  They have a variety of great breads to choose from--I'd recommend the Fred's bread potato focaccia. It's absolutely delicious with thin, soft chip-like potato slices on top, and herbs. So yummy.  I usually get the smoked salmon and am always happy. Smoked salmon, arugula, asiago and roasted red peppers. Super yummy.  Cons: The salad is gross. I just scarf it down so I can get to the sandwich. There isn't a lot of seating. It's pretty expensive for a sandwich and some greens tossed in cheap olive oil and even cheaper balsamic vinegar.   It's definitely my favourite sandwich place I've been to so far. A bit pricey but they offer Fred's bread and I love Fred's bread.  If I wasn't clear, GET THE FRED'S BREAD! :o)"}
{"text":"Nice place. Takeout only. Consistantly good. These sandwhiches are pretty darn good. Its a bit on rhe pricy side for a sandwhich, but sont let it stop you, they have great ingrediants. And I love the salad that comes with the sandwhich."}
{"text":"Sometimes a man's fate is inextricably linked to that of his favorite sandwich joint.   I'm partial to this location, which replaced a high-end sneaker boutique just North of Bloor Street just as I started work in the area.   I've been a fan of Da Box since I worked further downtown, and made almost daily trips to the Royal Bank Centre for healthy sandwiches and hearty soups. I valued the walk as much as the lunch, chained as i was to a dismal job at an office I disliked.   When I saw that my favorite spot would be joining me in my new career, in my new life, I felt as though fate had smiled upon me at last.   So I eagerly waited, and waited, and waited for it to open. By the time the Sandwich Box did open, my contract was almost finished, so those first few precious bites of ham and swiss were tinged wit the bitterness of possible unemployment.   But then I found a new job nearby, where I work happily and nosh to my heart's content, so it's all good.   So, yeah, they serve sandwiches; deliciously fresh-made on good, fresh bread; topped with your choice of spread, veg, and protein. If you like, you can get your sandwich grilled. Do it. Do it now. You could grill a shoe and it would taste better.  For about $8 your sandwich comes with a fistful of simply dressed greens, and the ability to pretend that you're eating healthy (though really, if you opt for salami and cheese, it doesn't matter how much mesclun you scarf down).   Iconoclasts may opt for the salad bar. Salads are fresh, with ample variety, but it's priced by weight, and sometimes arrive with a side of sticker shock. Soups are a better and more cost-effective option. A rotating selection of mostly vegetable purees can be customized with corn, caramelized onions and/or parmesan cheese, and generally include a vegan option. They're almost uniformly good; not far off what you could make at home, but you don't have to clean out your thermos after lunch.   They make an excellent and affordable lunch alongside one of the pre-made sandwiches that occupy a cooler towards the front of the store. A $4 Ham and Swiss sandwich is a steal. More fresh bread (this time, multigrain), dijonnaise, good quality meat and cheese, lettuce and tomato. It's actually better than what I would make for myself. Egg salad is adequate, but underflavored. Ditto for tuna, both of which could use some tomato as well. Variations with shrimp, egg and avocado score better, especially when the avocado is at it's freshest (it does have a tendency to go unpleasant with age).   Packaged salads, desserts, and beverages including addictive peach iced tea round out the menu.   The latest Sandwich Box faces competition from exotic spots up and down Bloor and Yonge. Whether its pho, falafel, jerk or waffles. It's all got a place, but sometimes it's nice to just think inside the Box."}
{"text":"Just had a sandwich! It was realllly good! I am impressed! Only thing is they could wipe the table more often. Other then that, fantastic food and fun place!"}
{"text":"Tania's ROTD reminded me that I had a review to write for this place.  Overall the food is good, probably 4-stars good. However, this place is a huge ripoff. The tiny amount of ingredients for the hugely inflated prices you pay really make this place not worth it. You get nickel and dimed for every little thing and they try to add extra enticement by including a \"salad\" with your meal.  I'll stick to the places like Porta Via where I actually get value for my hard earned sandwich dollars."}
{"text":"Eating my $15 sandwich now- awful: the arugula i extra paid for is so bitter and wilted. The mushrooms mostly fell out during the careless transfer from the preparation counter to the sandwich press. This Sandwich should be thick and delicious.  I also asked if the prices went up and with a glare got a flippant 'uh yeah a long time ago'   I'll pack my own next time i have the urge for a crappy sandwich.  Tip to the staff: please clean the sandwich grill. I can taste how dirty it is  ..."}
{"text":"Consistently good sandwiches. The magic is in the bread and the spread. Mix and match to make your own sandwich, pick a good combo, or whatever. Salad is okay. Side salad that comes with the sandwich is primarily for digestive purposes. Seating is limited and you may need to wait 10 minutes at peak lunch times. Otherwise very quick.   Great rosemary focaccia. Sundried tomato spread is awesome. Prosciutto is a bit stringy. Hummus is earthy and plain. Caramelized onions can be a bit soggy but the flavor is great. Avacados are usually good, though skip them if they've browned too much. Stick to whatever looks freshest and you won't be disappointed.   Price is on the high side for the small size, $8 - $10 / person depending on what you order. You can't make a batch of sandwiches for the same price at home.   The quality ingredients make all the difference with the sandwich flavor. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I was absolutely devastated when Sandwich Box left Queen Marketplace to change locations as it's now farther away from my workplace.   I am absolutely in LOVE with their soups - most recommended are the Spicy Tomato & Ginger or Smoked Turkey Bisque with Rice. If you check their website they list the soups of the day (one vegan/wheat free option and another that's creamy or meaty) right there so you know before going (I bugged the owner to add this feature for about a year so I'm glad he finally did!).  Fine, I'll talk about the sandwiches too. The concept is so simple you'll marvel at the fact that someone else didn't beat them to it (although there's a place on Queen now called \"Healthy Greek\" that has tried to duplicate the concept, and was later reprimanded by Sandwich Box for doing so). Pick your bread (choice of 10 breads), a spread (again, maybe 10 options) and then three toppings, which can include meat, cheese and veg or a combination of the three.   I'm partial to the white swiss triangle with avocado mayo, roasted zucchini, avocados and brie cheese. Or sometimes thinly sliced Granny Smith apples. Unbelievably tasty, toasted or not."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Sandwich in a Box and the addition of a location on Richmond makes up for the loss everyone in the Queen/ John area suffered when they moved out of the Queen marketplace across the street from MuchMusic.  I highly recommend the swiss triangle (a white, light, soft bread) with artichoke spread (vegan), avocado and tomato with turkey. They add salt, pepper, a squeeze of lemon and oil, and then grill that delicious sandwich before putting it into a box with a little mixed leaf salad. Delicious.  There are lots of other options for sandwiches- various meats, cheeses, spreads and a large variety of breads. The salad bar is expansive in its offerings - nuts, seeds, fruits, all the regular items you'd expect, plus radish, hearts of palm, silver skin onions and less frequent salad toppings that will make you go \"Oooh I want that.\" I'd go as far to argue that Sandwich in a Box is a better salad option that Lettuce Eatery (soon to be renamed Freshii)  Throw in some delicious ever changing soups and Sandwich in a Box is a sure thing for a healthy yummy sandwich option. My sandwich is about $9.  Locations are at 67 Richmond W, 238 Queen St W and 37 Eglington Ave E - check for more locations and other details at www.sandwichbox.ca"}
{"text":"Summary: expensive salad with good ingredients  I tried make-my-own sandwich here. For half of small bowl salad, it costs me around $8, which is pretty expensive. The place was clean. They laid all the ingredients in front of you. The salad I try to make did not taste that good. This is a good place if you want to have a good salad and did not mind the price. I probably would not come back again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great way to customize your own meal.   If you haven't checked it out you absolutely should!"}
{"text":"Really?? How did I forget to write a review on this awesome lunch place!!   Best sandwich place (well, in TO at least) ever!!! Love the variety of breads, topings and cheese. Been there a couple of times........   Love their pancetta, grilled eggplant and argula. Their salad bar is appealing too, but I'm at a sandwich place!!   It's pricey tho so it's like a treat to myself if ever I go."}
{"text":"I have found my Sandwich Heaven on Bay Street!  It's a fresh made to order sandwich and the combinations and possibilities here are mind blowingly delicious. This is how it works:  1. Pick you bread.  They got baguettes, loaves, rounds, boules, focaccia, whole wheat, multi grain, rye, rosemary, potato, olive...baked fresh and sliced to order from Fred's Bakery  2. Pick your spread. They have 7 options of homemade spreads (3 are vegan) varieties include Curried Apple, Avocado Cipotle Mayo and Sundried Tomato plus the standard mustards and mayos.  3.Pick any combo of the following 3: Meat, Cheese, Vegetables  Then they brush it with olive oil and toast it up in there panini press and serve it alongside there signature lightly dressed side salad all in a cute little box ready to go for $7.95 + tax ($1 more for additional toppings).  They have a selection of drinks, fresh fruit, cookies, puddings, and hot beverages as well as salads, daily soups, and ready to go sandwiches available too.  After a few minutes of staring in awe at my options I decided to go with the:   Rye and Caraway Seed Bread with the Roasted Garlic and Cumin Aioli spread. I couldn't settle on just 3 toppings so I shelled out an extra buck for 4 toppings - Carmelized onions, Grilled Eggplant, Jalapeno Havarti and Roast Beef.   I loved every square inch of this sandwich! They toasted it perfectly, crunchy golden exterior, the creamy spread garlicy spread compliamented the flavour of the freshly sliced bread rye bread, the roast beef was REAL meat, you could see the variations of doneness in the meat, it was not that bland old brown packaged variety, the grilled eggplant and wonderful carmelized onions were draped perfectly in melted Jalapeno Havarti. It came with a lightly dressed fresh and crisp side salad. To drink San Pellegrino Aranciata - sparkling Orange flavoured Italian Soda. Not too sweet with a balanced tartness,  All in all a delightfully delicious sandwich experience from start to finish! Some might argue that prices are a bit steep here but for such great fresh quality ingredients here I wouldn't have expected any less.  FYI Limited seating, they have a giant picnic table which is the only available seating. Check there website/twitter for daily soup listing as it changes daily!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars if it wasn't so pricey, but they do make a good sandwich, got great breads, and the servers were quite nice, even when I was asking questions about the menu and toppings (being my first time there).  I ended up picking my own toppings for a panini. It came up to about $10.  Decent place for a quick lunch!"}
