{"text":"Great place to have your breakfast or lunch if in the area. Serves breakfast all day, which is definitely a good move. And the service was very pleasant and eager to serve. The atmosphere is relaxed with good lighting, raised ceiling, and intriguing local artwork. I would suggest this place to anyone looking for a quick bite in the area."}
{"text":"How do you polish a turd? Stick a cafe in the lobby of a historic building, call it an art gallery and wala! Claims of fresh baked goods are simply nonsense. Jug processed hummus and industrialized bagels that taste like cardboard. Let's not forget about the staff, impersonal and seemingly miserable. If you're not happy -- quit your job. This place only stays open because of convenience for Tower Press' residents. It's definitely not because of their gaudy, awful jewelry they never sell at the boutique that's in the corner of the cafe eating area. Tip: if someone wants a panini at 830am, just make it. You're not filling anyone with your claim that you're not serving \"lunch items\" -- you literally have 10 items in your menu. 99% of which aren't vegan-friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place--not only because it has good art and good coffee and foodstuffs, but also because it's across from the PD."}
{"text":"quaint little place... stopped in for a coffee and a breakfast sandwich around 9am. Place had a few customers nice quiet place to unwind...  breakfast sandwich was good coffee was great!  be coming down town for 30 years did not know this place was there... Nice surprise XD"}
{"text":"Best damn brownie I have ever had. Nothing else matters."}
{"text":"Such a great find.   Great little cafe with good coffee, great sandwiches, in an artfully revived historic building in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is cute. Lots of seating. Open and spacious feel for creative thinking. It's clean and the ac isn't set to crazy. There's a couple comfy couches in the back.  There's what seems to be free parking in the back lot. That is probably the best part.  Their breakfast sandwiches are made to order, delicious, and inexpensive! I had the pica pica, which was eggs, pepper jack, Pico, on a croissant. Yum! Also had green pomegranate tea.   The staff are super friendly. There's definitely some regulars here, and they knew them by name. It's probably people who live in the building. I'm not sure if I'll end up being a regular but I will try to be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick filling meal. This is also an art gallery you can enjoy! Love the staff, super nice!"}
{"text":"Great little sandwich and coffee place tucked in an old landmark building off of Superior.  The service is always friendly and the food is consistently good - coffee quality is high as well.     The highlight is the Cuban sandwich- arguably one of the best sandwiches in Cleveland!  Worth a stop when you are on the near east side downtown."}
{"text":"*Currently inserting foot in mouth*  Boy, was I wrong to review this place before I actually tried their lunch. I've lived in Cleveland my whole life, but Artefino is the perfect example of one of the lesser-none-places you will most likely accidentally stumble upon. But, you'll be damn glad you did!   I know I'm always preaching this, but it's hard to find a work-friendly atmosphere you can hang out in all-day, get stuff done all while boasting lots of healthy food options. The Root, Nexus Cafe and now, Artefino is on this awesome, limited list. And man, do I feel stupid before judging this book by its cover!   You have plenty of healthful breakfast items to grab on-the-go, and it's offered all day long! There is little I love more than breakfast sandwiches whenever I want them. Egg whites? Whole grain breads? You got it! Same idea goes with their homemade soups, freshly prepared sandwiches, tasty salads and melty, pressed paninis. They have more than your fair share of veggie-friendly items, too. Oh, and smoothies made sans syrup-y, fattening, calorie-packed crap! You can even design your own sandwich and make it into a half combo with soup or salad.   The staff is super-nice and you can see all the food being made to order. I can't wait to chill and have some more working lunches here! I was even wrong about the metered parking in the front--there's free parking in the back of the building!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service! Very pleasant environment, and local art- what's not to love?"}
{"text":"As I continued my adventures across the coffee shops of the Greater Cleveland Area, Artefino was next on my list. And I have to say...I have to give this place another try later on. The reason being is that while I like the interior and the vibe of this place (not too large or too small), I hated the coffee. But it's also my fault for ordering that particular drink so there's that. I ordered a medium Mexican Mocha. Now, whenever I've had that particular drink there's always a hint of a kick, a hint of a spice. This particular iteration wasn't a hint. It took the spice and punched the back of my throat. Three gulps and it was burning, not in a pleasant way and I had to put it down and take a break. Too much cinnamon or nutmeg or just mix of pain and suffering. Maybe it was punishment for not studying I'm not sure. The energy balls I got along with the coffee helped me drink a good portion of it. I paid for it and was determined - though thankfully it wasn't expensive, around $3/$4.  So for now, I'd have to give it a three stars. The other drinks off of the menu HAVE to be better. They also have a sandwich and panini menu. The staff was very pleasant and personable. Coupled with the fact that there's a parking lot behind the place you can park for free in downtown Cleveland and I'm sold. You can also enter the building through the back and navigate through the hallways to get to the cafe which is fantastic if you go on a day like I did where my fingers were slowly freezing and about to fall off of my body as the wind and snow buffetted the rest of me.   Come here for the drinks (NOT the Mexican Mocha), the food (the menu looked delicious), and the atmosphere (Christmas music and all). It's a great place to meet with friends and do some work but it's by no means quiet so be warned!"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often for lunch since I work nearby. This small but cute cafe is a nice place to grab a sandwich or salad during the week. Everything is always fresh and the staff is always friendly and fast. They even serve brekfast all day long which is a plus. The negative thing I would have ro say is their coffee usually tastes watered down."}
{"text":"What a stinking (but not literally) cute café.  Admittedly, I've driven by the Tower Press building a thousand times, but never went in. During Sparx City Hop, I finally stopped in for a tea after exploring the building from the Sparx blue line... and now I don't know why I didn't sooner. For starters, the café isn't exclusive to Tower Press residents and artists. Anyone can stop in. It definitely has an artsy vibe, which is totally enhanced by the residents and artists who pass through. They also have art and jewelry on display, and some cozy, colorful seating. Really good feng shui and vibes coming out of this shop.  To my surprise, they also have a small food menu! I came in expecting a small coffee menu, but ended up just craving lunch. I had a small chai tea latte to-go, but I will definitely come back here in the future for lunch, and maybe even to hang and get some work done. Artefino is a little off the beaten path of the regular coffee shops, and I love that. Don't be discouraged by parking...there's free parking in the back of the building!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after lunch for an early afternoon caffeine boost to insure no post lunch snoozing during a business meeting.  Ordered a couple of 16 oz. Cappuccinos for me and co-worker - one with soy, one regular. Both were very good. It took a bit longer to get them - they probably need someone dedicated to making espresso drinks while someone else runs the register. I had to wait for the guy running the register to get through the line of people - taking their orders and ringing them up before he started making our drinks.  There is a good bit of seating in here - looks like a cool, hip place to hang out, enjoy some caffeine, and get on the 'net and get some work done."}
{"text":"Our family was traveling in Cleveland and looking for a fun place to grab coffee and a quick breakfast. We went out of our way to go to Artefino Cafe. It took a couple trips around the block to find parking and had trouble entering the door and walked around the building to the front. We finally found our way in to the building and to the cafe to find that it was closed even though the hours were clearly marked saying that the cafe should have opened 30 min ago. This is clearly a cafe intended for the artists in the building and not intended to be a destination. We were beyond frustrated."}
{"text":"I love this place. I had forgotten about it but had some time to kill in the neighborhood so dropped in. Coffee is good, not great, but I am a coffee snob so if i say its good then its pretty above average. I have never actually eaten the food, but it looks really good and on the cheap.   Really what I like is the location and vibe. The Tower Press building is an amazing building. It is worth just walking around and checking out. There is always cool, interesting artwork on the walls and interesting people to talk to. If I lived closer I would hang out more, but I am glad to visit here and there."}
{"text":"One of Cleveland's best kept secret delis! Salads and sandwiches are amazing! The parking is not super convenient but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Artefino is a good place to grab coffee in the morning. The service here is outstanding and the staff is very friendly and personable. The breakfast sandwiches are good, I suggest the egg and cheese on multigrain bread. I only order black coffee and it tastes like better coffee than I could brew. There is some artwork hanging on the walls and on display behind glass cases. A little too expensive for my budget. Good to look at while waiting for food regardless. The lunch sandwiches are alright. If you are on this side of town, you should stop in. If you are not really close, you probably should not drive that far because it is something that you could get somewhere else without a slew of bums hanging out by a church smoking rock asking you for some money."}
