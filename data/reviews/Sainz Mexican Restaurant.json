{"text":"This place is awesome. Always makes me feel like I am at nana's house eating. 
 There isn't anything there that I don't like. They have the best red chile that I can find. There best and most authentic enchilada sauce. I am always suprised when I go in here that it isn't more busy. 
There service is not always the greatest. I give them slack though cause more of the waitresses look like they are there just to help their nana out. 
I love this place and will continue to return all the time. I hope that it beefs up in buisness cause it is good."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have had since Rocky Pointe. They have authentic food thats always freshly made. 

Its not spicy its flavorful. 

We frequent this place several times a month for at least the past few years and never have I been disappoint"}
{"text":"So one of my bestest friends bought a new town home just off the I10 and 83rd Ave.. very cute place surrounded by fields that I'm sure will be under new construction soon enough. Well the downside of his new digs is that its on the edge of Tolleson and Maryvale, probably one of the highest crime areas in Phoenix. On the flip side he's very close to shopping and of course many, many Mexican restaurants.

So we drove up McDowell looking for a place for some yummy eats when we stumbled on Sainz. Let me tell you, this place is da bomb! While they do mostly take out and drive thru this isn't one of the place ending in 'tos. Ive been here twice already and the food, pricing and portions are tasty, bargain and large! Nothing over 9 bucks! 

The red chile is the star here.. large chunks of tender pork simmered in a tasty creamy red gravy all wrapped in a warm soft tortilla. Many in the valley try to make red chile but few nail it like Sainz does. 

A few things I will knock.. the service is iffy.. they are VERY stingy with the salsa and hot sauce and the families that dine there don't seem to care about keeping their kids from bothering anyone else, it's Romper Room in there! 

So from now on I think we'll just do take out unless I can tell that the kids are at home.
