{"text":"I have experienced so many wonderful foods and great employees at dolce wraps, all but the last time. I work on lorain road very close to the restaurant and I love nonchain places.  But the last time I was there they dropped my delicious wrap on the ground, the young lady who dropped the wrapped looked at me and apologized about the time it would take to make another, it was no bother. Until I saw the mid to late twenties male manger type interrupt her, grab the wrap from her and wrap it in new paper and give it to me. I guess because I was meandering by the soda machines he assumed I wound not notice. I had already paid, knowing that I would never come back, I said nothing as I grabbed the wrap and threw it away on the way out. Sucks too because that food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Several years ago when I first starting coming here I would have most definitely rated dolce wrap a 5 star. Over the course of the past 3 years I've routinely gotten the same menu item as it wow'd me from the start. However in the past couple of years it's lost a lot of its flavor and consistency and how it's been made depending on the person making it. I keep going back hoping it'll be the same and every time I find myself disappointed that I'm never having the same experience. In the beginning when I would order my wrap it would be very flavorful, you could definitely taste the sauce on the wrap, and it would be warm and soft. However now there's hardly any sauce but on it and barely warmed up causing it to be chewy. I don't think dolce wrap is bad, I just know how much better they can be  and find myself let down each time I go back and it's not the same as it once was."}
{"text":"If I were to create a \"fast food\" restaurant, it would be this place but it would be located in Lakewood rather than Rocky River, and I'd also use something other than the Walt Disney font for the logo.  Besides that, this place is PERFECT.  It's a Chipotle style build-your-own-wrap type place, and so much more.  The meals are restaurant quality delivered at fast food prices and prep time.  Dolce Wraps is in my top 5 of non-\"fast food\" fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"I love all the food here. The hummus is outstanding . The lamb, steak and chicken is great also. They have a very nice staff."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was pretty bad.    4 stars for the food, 1 star for the service. ______________________  Greeted by an over-the-top employee who told us not to get the sandwich, BC the bread goes bad, and sandwiches were for people who were too unadventurous to try a wrap, (I didn't realize that wraps were that cutting edge).  We ordered 2 wraps, the first was ready promptly when we paid for our order.  We sat, and we waited for the other wrap, cue the crickets.  Over the next ten minutes, we did not see any employees behind the counter preparing anything.  However we could here their yelling and carrying on from their kitchen area to where we were seated at the other end of the restaurant and we were the only customers there.  An employee talking on her cell phone, noticed us and yelled to back for someone to make the other wrap.  Crickets again. Finally another employee did reappear.  When I asked about the other wrap, I was give a lame excuse that the delay was because falafel was still frying.  Who knew it takes 15 minute to fry a few falafel, I certainly didn't... My bad!  Not sure if that second wrap was worth the really long wait, but both wraps were good.   I wouldn't mind eating their food again.  Hopefully they catch on to the concept of timing their orders based on preparation time, so meals arrive at the same time.  (BTW, I feel a little  guilty complaining about this place, as I don't really take fast food seriously, after all we are only talking about sandwiches/wraps here)"}
{"text":"Kind of like Greek Village Grill in Lakewood, except here they have a restroom for their customers, and an incredible selection of fountain drinks. The staff is top notch, the place is super clean, even their restrooms, the food is cooked in front where you can see your food being made, and for the price you get highly quality food and a great portion. They offer kids meals if you have small children. I love the protein packer wrap, and get a side of their pita chips for just a dollar more, and buy the garlic sauce to dip them in. You will not go wrong eating here. I have eaten here about twice a month for the past two years and have never had a bad meal. Additionally, my coworkers who are vegetarians love eating here."}
{"text":"Love it! The name doesn't do it justice, \"wraps\" sounds so limiting as to what their menu really is. If you're not sure what to try, just ask the owner is super helpful."}
{"text":"Seeing as how this is the highest rated restaurant in Rocky River, I had to give it a try. Believe me, it did not disappoint. I could probably eat here every day of the week. Everything I have tried has been so delicious. I am very picky about my hummus, and theirs is very good. The rotisserie chicken hummus wrap, chicken moroccan wrap and the curry chicken salad wrap are my favorites."}
{"text":"Excellent. All of their wraps are awesome. And the pita chip sampler with different sauces is amazing. I have never had a bad meal here. I will keep coming back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, freshly prepared food. Very clean restaurant and extremely helpful staff. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Dolce Wrap has become my \"go-to\" restaurant. Excellent food and service. I eat here at least twice a week, and it's always consistently great."}
{"text":"I want to give Dolce Wraps 5 stars.  I really do.  I go there probably twice a week.  In fact, I almost have enough points on the reward system for a free wrap.  It's those sauces...they just call my name.   But, I can't.  (Womp, womp) It's the service.   If you get this one girl that works there, you won't understand what I am talking about.  She is so incredibly sweet and helpful.  She even makes me venture out of my normal order comfort zone to at least try a combination of sauces.  (Once I find something I like at a restaurant I usually order the same thing every time.  I don't want to waste a trip there and get something I like less!)  I do a \"praise Jesus\" cheer in my head when I see her behind the counter. However, there are a few others there that...let's just say probably didn't get the awards for \"best smile\" or \"most outgoing\" in high school.   I honestly end up feeling bad for placing an order and then paying for my food.  Because that makes sense, right?  I mean, why on Earth would I come in to an open restaurant and order something off the menu (with no changes to how it comes mind you) and then pay for it!  The nerve! Anyway, I'm not sure if this place is family owned and that's why these attitudes are allowed or what but from other reviews at least I know I am not the only one.   I've just made it my own little game now when I go in there.  Lets see if I can get a smile...c'mon...you know you want to.  Nope.  Ok, maybe next time.  Because I'll be back.  Those sauces.....mmmmm....."}
{"text":"Grade of A for the food, but maybe a C- for the atmosphere. I had zero issues with the food, it was very good. But, I would be more inclined to order take out next time.   First walking in the door, I was treated to a pile of outdoor furniture and no one behind the counter. It was not obvious where to go, how to order, or where we were supposed to take a seat. They had two flat screens above the counter area which would've suggested a menu, but instead it was on paper.   We were told we could sit on the bar area and order, so we did.  The bartender was very nice and reasonably attentive. However, what we didn't like was the feeling that the 'owners' were sitting at the bar talking and just apparently hanging out, but also maybe watching the small number of patrons and seeming to analyze what we were doing. It almost felt as if we were intruding on them.   I am not suggesting that they actually felt this way, but it felt that way to me... I don't like being observed while I try to eat dinner.   Now to my other pet peeve. I won't eat at a place I think is dirty. The menu I was given had a sticky ring of something on it, and the granite bar had a film of grime. Of course I tried not to look too hard for fear that the owners might come over and make an issue out of it, so I ignored it.   Later there was a brief family squabble about which car someone did or didn't drive... not really adding to my enjoyment.   I will mention that the men's room was clean, so that was a big plus.   All in all, good food, reasonable prices, good service. Need to consider how welcoming your place is to guests. I will try once more, but probably takeout for me.   This is a nice change of pace, I was hoping to add to my short list of restaurants I frequent on the Brecksville to Strongsville area."}
{"text":"Love this place, the people who work there are really nice and the food is good and super cheap. I usually grab a chicken wrap with hummus and some mango curry :)"}
{"text":"I love this place and can't stop ordering the falafel wrap with hummus and hot sauce, utterly delicious!"}
{"text":"A lil dirty and we were kinda rushed out but the girl working was nice about it. My Moroccan steak wrap didnt have enough sauce so no flavor. My daughter's freah cut fries were seasoned but flimsy and the tomatoes were soggy and they put a ton on everything."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time today and WOW.  Absolutely delicious!  I got the hummus chicken wrap.  First, the portion size is huge.  I opted for the chipotle sauce after the nice girl working the counter showed me the samples of all the home made sauces.  The wrap was so good, tons and tons of flavor and all for (if I recall correctly) under $6?!?  New favorite place, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place, attractive. Great food.  Best tabouli I've ever had.  Very reasonable.  Try one of the ice teas, too."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for a quick delicious dinner. We eat here 3-4 times a month...sometimes more. Food is wonderful and affordable. Homemade sauces are excellent. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Best hummus and falafel. We have been coming here for years and the food keeps getting better.  Falafel wrap is awesome. My new favorite is the curry chicken salad wrap.  There is a chain pita shop right beside it, and I always wonder why people are going in there when Dolce has fantastic fresh homemade quick and affordable wraps."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never stopped in here! Food is fantastic accompanied by super friendly service. They ensured we tried all of the sauces (I had the mango curry, mom had the chipotle apricot and both tasted awesome) and couldn't pick a bad one. We each tried a plate, and food was so fresh and tasty, nice portions and great flavors. 4 different choices of fresh tea, so refreshing. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, sauces are out of this world (especially the hot sauce) and staff is incredibly friendly. I would describe this as a carryout Aladdins, with a much lower price tag (although you can eat in, there are no waiters)."}
{"text":"the food is undeniably good and mostly homemade which is great for people with allergies - the staff can tell you what is in the food you are ordering.  it's been a nice spot to pick up a healthy fast meal, but I think I've had my fill of dolce after my experience today.  filthy floors and tables - sticky filth. there literally wasn't once clean table to eat at. when my husband inquired about a rag and spray to bus our own table, the waitress replied that she didn't have anything like that. what?? that was actually the end of the conversation - I layered our spot with napkins. silverware - a couple lingering forks and spoons- they looked ok... our \"lymon\" pop had a black chunk of debris that I can't say for sure didn't come out of the dispenser.  again, our waitress was not surprised or apologetic.   best part of today's meal was watching another couple table hop from one dirty booth to the next."}
{"text":"I love this place. By the time I had my wallet out today my sandwich was ready. I happened to come in right after they finished the falafel and that's what I ordered. Always good and the servers/cooks are genuinely friendly.   Try the califry wrap if you want something a little greasy and fried, very good."}
{"text":"Well Dolce Wraps...... Just like Aladdins you come through with some nice Med food. I love the wraps. House made salsas, and those pita chips! Small Quite place to enjoy some nice food. Service is great and the owner is nice to talk to also. Thanks for opening this quick service gourmet wrap spot in my nieghborhood!"}
{"text":"After an awful week at work, my friend and I decided to give Dolce Wraps a shot.  When I first walked in, I found the atmosphere to be really nice and I liked that there are both tables and booths as well as a sitting area with a cute little fireplace.  The staff was prompt and friendly and very cooperative with my coupon.   We ordered the rotisserie chicken wrap with the garlic sauce and the fiesta steak wrap.  Both were absolutely delicious! The rice is tasty and quite savory, the chicken perfectly cooked and the garlic sauce is incredible.  It might be the best I've ever had. I didn't personally have the steak but my friend said he enjoyed it and it had a great flavor and plenty of spice without being too hot. .    We didn't have any sides because the wraps are humongous and if I have a complaint, that's it. My wrap was delicious. I ate well more than half of it but I recognize that it was probably 2-3 servings worth of wrap.  Despite the huge size, the prices are cheap and the food is delicious. Our bill all together for both wraps and a smoothie was less than $15 which is a great deal for a huge portion fresh and delicious food.  I'm generally kind of a complainer but I really enjoyed this place and would recommend it to anyone who wants to try something different."}
{"text":"For what's essentially a Middle Eastern Chipotle, the food was fantastic! Some if the best falafel I've ever had, and the teriyaki steak wrap was so flavorful, I couldn't put it down. I will definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"Delicious! We had 3 different wraps, soup & spinach pies - all so tasty! And everyone was so nice and accommodating. Highly recommended this spot!"}
{"text":"I had no idea what I was getting into with this place because the name of it, the font on the sign, and its location did not give anything away as to what they served.  I was pleased to discover that it is a Mediterranean Subway-speed restaurant with tons of a charm and a really awesome moving menu above the counter.  Talked with the owner for a bit upon entering while he had us taste the several different sauces used to stir fry veggies or as a topping.  He told us that his family owns Aladdin's (Lakewood and Westlake) and used to work for them, which makes sense because Aladdin's is amazing and this place is too.  His desire to go out on his own definitely paid off in the form of a cheaper, faster version of Aladdin's with equally delicious food.  The combination of curry sauces and the special spices that go into their rice made my taste buds very happy."}
{"text":"Unexplainable you have to just experience it for yourself.. so I'll sum it up in one word.   AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and a great value! The falafel wrap is huge and under 7 bucks. The customer experience was top notch. You can tell that the workers are vested in their success. The house made dips are to die for."}
{"text":"Excellent food, nothing over 6$, very clean place and great atmosphere.   My mom dropped half of her leftover shrimp wrap on the ground and Barah, an employee there got her a new one free of charge. The crew is awesome there, worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is easily one the best places to eat west of Lakewood. As a vegetarian, I almost always get the Veggie Heaven Sampler Plate which has Falafel, Hummus, Baba Ghanoush, Salata and Pita (pro tip: tear the pita in half for more dipping). Despite eating there every 2-3 weeks for a whole year I never got bored--despite the fact that I usually prefer variety. It was the last place I ate before I moved away.  The wraps are also good, although the sampler plate is a better bang for your buck.  Also their Aglio (garlic sauce) is amazing!! You can sample it, along with their other tasty sauces, before you order. I often got some on the side."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! They have great customer service, and amazing Middle Eastern cuisine! It tastes just like home cooked meals that I grew up with!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great rotisserie chicken salad! Service is pretty quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I came here for an event - not knowing what Dolce Wraps even served. I was pleasantly surprised. A delicious sample of their signature wraps and sauces, and a stunning salad were set out for us to enjoy. (I did not order off the menu, so I can't tell you exactly what I ate....but it was all good!)   I loved the cozy nooks and cool decor, yep Yelp, I will definitely be back.   (plus I hear they have baklava - What?!  And more than one kind?  oh yeah, I will be back!)"}
{"text":"I went here the other day and the food was fantastic, but the service was even better! I had never been here before and the lady who worked behind the counter did an awesome job of helping us pick out some good options. We each got an different wraps and she split them for us. Also, she had a really good smoothie recommendation for us too. Everything was good. We got the falafel wrap and the lamb wrap. We also got hummus to split and a mandarin orange and passion fruit smoothie.  Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Decent middle eastern with a twist - with extra courteous service"}
{"text":"I wanted to give the awesome people at Dolce Wraps, Avon, Ohio, a shout out.  Not only is the food and the prices great...but, if you're absent-minded enough to leave a badly worn, but, still super cool Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles wallet full of credit cards and $600.00 cash in your booth because you're wearing shorts without pockets...you can count on them to run out after you in the parking lot while you're pulling out so in order to return it to you.  Thanks again guys.  You rock!  :)"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. The workers are efficient and deliver great product and customer service. The chicken curry wrap and the eggplant wrap are very tasty."}
{"text":"Excellent Middle Eastern food done fast. Think of it as your favorite local Mid Eastern spot meets Chipotle. They serve most dishes as wraps or plates. The sauces are full of flavor and work well when combined together."}
{"text":"Great! We had a lamb and a steak wrap, and they were very good. Staff was helpful and nice. Pretty cheap for how good it was. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"No stars for the flaunting rude young woman whom completely missed our order without  any regret.  Actually started half of our order and walked away and left it not telling anyone it was started and sat next to our booth on a break.  she did inform the other unfortunate workers of the break but left them no report about our order even after they asked her about it. They actually hid in the back room obviously embarrassed and intimidated by her rude behavior.  It was a few months ago but after driving by yesterday it brought back the ill memory.  They gave us a choice of leaving or waiting for the order like it was our fault, we promptly walked after our refund!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Delicious wraps, gyros, hummus, spinach pies, I could go on and on!  Very fast and friendly service.  The owner is always there behind the counter cooking.  Very friendly and kind.  Way better than Aladdins!"}
{"text":"This review is for Dolce Wraps in Avon Commons. Sauce sampler sensational! Teriyaki and Chipolte burst with flavor. Never had falafel and co-owner Sammy gave me a sample. I'm now a fan.  Chicken and Steak wraps terrific. Chickpea chili also awesome and I didn't think I liked chickpea."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh, tasty, and a healthier option over traditional fast food.  The service is also exceptionally warm and friendly, and reasonably quick.  The dining room is very clean, and has a warm and inviting gas fireplace with a small sitting area if you want to hang out and relax a while.  I stop at Dolce Wraps often when I am out running errands and want a quick, fresh, and healthy lunch.  My customer experience is always a very positive one whether I am at the Westgate location, or the Avon location.  If you are looking for a break from boring burgers and fries, give Dolce Wraps a try."}
{"text":"My sister introduced me to this jewel of a place!  When you walk in everyone greets you with a smile and a hello.  The food is phenomenal with flavor and spiciness!  From the falafals to the wraps and to the different platters you can order, it is a plethora of tasty choices for anyone that has the pleasure of stopping in.  One of the coolest things about this place is that if you buy a gift card, you get a small discount in the process...and if you go to Dolce Wrap as often as I do, it's a steal of a deal!  Placed on the west side of the Westgate shopping center (facing 210/Wagar) it may be difficult to spot this place but you should definitely stop in.  Dare I say I enjoy it even more so than Aladdin's?  Yes.  I love this place!!!!  Try it out and see for your self, I promise you will not be disappointed :)  It is Aladdin's (but better) meets the platform of Panera's or Chipotle (no tipping)."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in here on a whim. We were utterly impressed with this place. As soon as we walked in we were greeted heartily by the owner Farrah. He is engaging and affable. It was our first time there and he took care to give us samples of anything we wanted to try. The samples were great and our final orders were delicious. We are definitely going to become regulars there. We used to be fans, yes I said \"used\" to be fans of Aladdin's but we now have a new favorite Mediterranean eatery."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been long-time customers and this was a go-to spot for us...until today. It seems over the past year that the level of service and food quality have gone down. Today an employee (apparently the owner's daughter) treated me so badly I'll never go back. I called the owner to complain and have yet to get a return call. Fortunately there are other great options like Sittoos in the area."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service and people, had the beef and chicken wrap that was delicious with very fresh tabouli and pitas"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! Great atmosphere and the two girls working there were wonderful. Unfortunately, I didn't catch their names but their service was superior. This was my first time and I'm upset that there's not a location closer to where I live. If your a fan of falafel like I am go for the Falafel Wrap. They have tons of options and I loved being able to taste the sauces before I ordered. This is defiantly a must try if your hungry, adventurous and in the area!"}
{"text":"Dolce Wraps - if Aladdin's and Chipotle had a baby, this would be it.  Dolce Wraps is awesome because they offer a mix of traditional Mediterranean food and other stuff, using their sauces to offer different flavors. There is something for everyone, including picky eaters and vegetarians!  As the name would imply, the wraps are what they are known for. They put them together then grill them (!!!) making the pita wrap all nice and toasty. My favorites are the chicken curry salad wrap, chicken hummus wrap, chicken/lamb Moroccan wrap.  Other good options are the lentil and rice salad and the falafel salad.   Speaking of falafel - THEY MAKE IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. Fresh, fried ground chickpea goodness.  The customer service is iffy. One time, my husband and I went right when we got home from our honeymoon (yes, we missed it that much), and they gave us a free dessert. Other times, my wrap is not even close to what I ordered. Tip: if you have a custom order, watch them make it so they get it right. It's usually when you go off-menu that they get it wrong (and then get a little snippy with you).  This is one of my regular weeknight takeout spots for a reason - with so many options (at a ridiculous cheap price point), it never gets old."}
{"text":"I love Dolce Wraps!  I often get take out for dinner.  The food is always so fresh and flavorful.  The prices are excellent, too.  The employees are eager to please and happy to accommodate special requests.  My favorite is the Veggie Sampler Plate.  The Chicken Moroccan Plate is delicious with the garlic sauce on the side."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Westgate. Always quick, great food, and great people who work there."}
{"text":"Friendly family owned and operated place which is far prefered over chain \"fast-food\" joints. Prices are low, high quality food, and staff usually very pleasant (we all have bad days). Used to eat there at least once a week before moving to east side (not a fan). If you are in Rocky River and looking for a quick, cheap eat....this is the place."}
{"text":"Aladdins who? That's how I feel after Dolce Wraps, which has become my midde eastern food go to came into my life. Their falafel is delicious and is a serious contender for the best falafel in the city rivaling even my all time favorite Mahas. It is fried fresh which is essential and is seasoned differently than any other falafel I had I can taste zatar in it which I love. Unlike aladdins they don't use eggs when making it so it has a different/superior texture and is totally vegan. Their salata salad is good too along with their hummus, baba and lets talk about those amazing sauces. Their garlic sauce is so damn good it is life affirming and I would eat nearly anything with it. Case in point I once had under cooked fries here and still ate them because they were a vessel for that sauce.  The staff in my experience has always been super polite and personable one time I was waiting not even that long and they gave me a free brownie for the inconvenience. And they have fresh cut fries here and free soda water.  This place is a game changer go now!"}
{"text":"Literally just finished my first meal (takeout) here and if the fresh catch wrap is any indication of the rest of the menu, this place is great! Food was delicious. The mix of fish, rice, and veggies along with the Greek and curry mango sauce was perfect. I tried the falafel and that was very good too. It's a family business and the daughters were very kind and helpful. I wish it was closer to home so that I could go more regularly, but I will make a point to go here to eat in the future."}
{"text":"Pretty bland falafel. The falafel itself were good, but the wrap overall was just ...meh... Full of lettuce, the pickled veggies were loose and soft. .. No crunch.  There was no sauce inside.... So it was very very dry. The pita itself was not fresh. Very chewy. I have had better from the Arabic store. Here is the most surprising part....... You have to pay extra if you want either tahini or hummus inside the wrap.  It is like a burger joint charging for ketchup!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a well kept secret. I hesitate to share the details of the delicious and authentic food as well as the extremely friendly service, as I do not want to wait in line when I get the urge to return. Great place!"}
{"text":"Hell to the YES. I love hummus, falafel, and other Mediterranean delicacies. This place hit the spot so hard. (I sound like a frat boy, don't I?)   Don't try to eat the entire wrap in one sitting unless you want to ache for an hour afterward. I should have stopped. But pregnant Rachel = nonLeftovereater, and I went back for the second half only about 15 minutes after I finished the first. I was sorry, but I would probably do the exact same thing again.  I would highly recommend this place! Service with a smile, and the food is brought out (we got takeout) HOT and fast."}
{"text":"I truly love this place and I don't like that people compare it to Aladdin's. To me, it is nothing like Aladdin's and shouldn't be compared at all. They do serve Mediterranean cuisine but that's about all that is the same (rant over).  This is one of my go to places when I need a quick meal or want leftovers for lunch. After trying a few different wraps I have found that the Chicken Morrocan wrap is my absolute favorite. The wraps run around $7 each and they are large! I always have half leftover. The rice is always perfectly cooked and the chicken is outstanding (grilled and never dry). Also, you are able to build your own wraps and choose any sauce you would like. They always have all their sauces out for sampling with pita chips. The only warning I will give is that their garlic sauce is superb but it will seep from your pores for at least 3 days! Don't go out in public directly after having this sauce! :)  Next time you need a lunch idea check this place out!"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter, and I stopped here after a track meet but before a drive thru movie.  The food was awesome! No complaints from any of us!!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing, but the service is even better.  The owner is a wonderful, kind, open hearted man and his staff works to make your visit the best yet.  I love the Westgate location as it is close to my work and a great place to go on my lunch breaks. 5 stars - I cannot say enough."}
{"text":"As promised I gave the falafel wrap a try. I did add hummus, garlic sauce and hot sauce as suggested. Out of the three wraps I tried this is by far my favorite, and I'm not even vegetarian. The falafel reminded me of meat and the sauces were mandatory. The sauces definitely made the wrap. My only complaint is the garlic sauce, it's absolutely delicious but it will have you tasting garlic all day. Don't have any if you are going anywhere but home. Oh, and the pastries: not so much. As a Greek girl, the baklava was unacceptable (yet edible). Just OK. So, just to recap, the falafel wrap is good, but I shouldn't have had to go threw 3 items before i found something yummy."}
{"text":"Stephanie had gone there with some friends and thought the food was very good, so i wanted to check it out. Not that I don't trust her taste, but sometimes we're not exactly simpatico regarding restaurants. I was looking to have something a little bit different for lunch today and got it in a good way.  I was pleasantly surprised by the place. The space is open and airy. It's only three weeks old, so the interior should look fantastic. It does. Very clean behind the counters in the food preparation space where you can see while they make your order. Has a split-level upstairs bar that I noted, but did not check out. (Hey - I went there Sunday before noon.)  The staff was nice, if not a bit clueless as I had to order my desert three different times. Each time I asked if there was a special name or ingredients to the unique desserts that they had, but they didn't seem to understand what I was asking.  I had the chicken with curry wrap. The curry was flavored with mango. They had samples of the various sauces out before and I took a liking to it. Nothing like a little sweet and a little spicy mixed together.  The chicken was off a spit (unfortunately they did not cut it at the same time as making - that would have been delightful) completing the wrap with rice and a tomato salsa. It was tasty and filled me up for less than six bucks (under 9 with the desert and no drink). I could have reasonably eaten half of the wrap, and saved the other half for dinner. But I was hungry.  I also will not pass up two deserts EVER: pecan pie and baklava. No pecan pie (that might be odd given the restaurant's food) but three different types of Baklava. So I had a side of Baklava with an angel hair like phyllo crust. I'm sure it has some special name, but I didn't much care that they couldn't understand me as it looked (and indeed tasted) delicious. I will likely be back when I have a taste for something different for lunch again."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. Delicious food. Had the lamb kebab wrap. Tasty, fresh, and lots of flavor"}
{"text":"The food was good. However, I did not appreciate seeing the girl smashing the deep fried kebbeh (if not kebbeh, something like kebbeh) with bare hands before placing it in my wrap. Just for the record, she wiped her bare hands on her dirty apron before smashing each kebbeh.  The wrap was good... maybe her apron had some seasoning on it or something! ha"}
{"text":"I ate dinner at this restaurant tonight. The food was GREAT, the restaurant is very clean, people are very friendly and the prices are very reasonable. I recommend it to everyone !"}
{"text":"Dolce wraps is one of the best rated place on yelp and that says something about this small little place in the middle of a typical suburban mall. I went there directly from work to get a quick bite and fell in love with it. It has some very enthusiastic staff. They had me try some of their sauces before I decided on what I wanted.   I ordered their hummus and falafel wrap and it was very good. I would not describe it as extraordinary because honestly I have had better but that does not undermine the quality and taste of this one. I will be coming here for the same dish again. I like the overall environment at this place.   Sitting arrangement is limited and there is very little light in the front at night. Overall a very good place to eat wraps."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here! The fries are amazing too but must be split between many people since the wraps are pretty substantial."}
{"text":"Haven't had anything here I haven't liked. The falafel is my favorite in the area and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I've only managed to eat here one time since everything I ordered was so good (rice and lentil salad, sampler plate, and stir fried veggies) and so reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I can't help but write another amazing review for these girls. I eat here almost every week and the girls are so NICE!! They're fast, the food is amazing and the chicken.. oh the chicken is so good. I brought my coworker in the other day and she couldn't believe how good it was. Go here!!"}
{"text":"Have only had one meal here, but it was great. Fresh ingredients, fast service. Falafel is crunchy and full of flavor.   I had the terryaki steak plate. It was just fine, but I'll try something else next time. It's a great concept, and I hope they open one in Akron soon."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Mediterranean food and dolce wraps definitely hit the spot. The smell was intoxicating, and the taste was even better. I got the lentil and veggie plate and I loved it. Dolce wraps will definitely see more of me."}
{"text":"one my favorite places to go to. ALWAYS fast and always friendly faces. I have my regular picks. Definitely nothing bad on the menu."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal. Love the wraps, especially the rotisserie chicken wrap. Comes with seasoned rice, vegetables and yogurt inside. Just lovely with pita chips and a dipping sauce."}
{"text":"The Customer Service here sucks. The servers were too busy complaining about Management to be helpful. The lady asked us rather curtly, \"yeah...what do you want?\" Our order was screwed up and gave us only 1 wrap when 2 were ordered. Then once we got our food we couldn't find a place to sit. Every single table has crumbs and was dirty. I shouldn't have to asked to have a table whipped down. The food is flavorful and delicious but it was mostly rice and barely any chicken. As we dined they continued to complain about their jobs and the customers they had to serve."}
{"text":"What a great place!  How refreshing to see a Middle Eastern fast casual restaurant.  I decided to compare Dolce Wraps with Maha's (at West Side Market).  I give major props to Dolce Wraps for their sauces and hummus.  Deelish.  As for the falafel, Maha's is better.  But I gotta tip my hat to the manager (owner?) of this place.  He knows most of his customers by name and you can tell he runs a tight ship.  Food service is fast and friendly.  The food is LOADED with garlic.  So if you have an important business meeting or interview, pack some seriously intense mints to cover up the gaaaaahhh-lic breath!"}
{"text":"Flavor wise, 5 stars hands down. The meat is very soft and flavored well. The sauces and sides are excellent as well.  Portion sizes were a bit small (comparing the amount of meat you could get for $7 at say, chipotle).   2/3 of the staff was very friendly. Nothing outrageous by the third party but definitely stuck out and left some enthusiasm to be desired.  Overall, would probably go back since the food is so good."}
{"text":"My favorite felafel sandwich.  Make sure to add hummus, garlic sauce, and hot sauce."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices you can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"Mediocre Mediterranean food. Worth the price but horrible customer service. Most of the time the girls working the front counter were in the back and not present when customers needed them or walked in. When I went up to the front desk to order a drink, no one was present to help me so I helped myself. I rudely was approached by Farrah. Will not return."}
{"text":"Saw all these great Yelp reviews and have wanted to try this place for months.  Came with the Wife to pick up some wraps.  We called in the order 45 minutes ahead of time.   When we got there, the restaurant was empty save for one young lady at the grill station.  When we got to the counter, she turned, looked at us, and then turned back her cleaning of the stove.  Not a word of greeting, not even a smile or nod.   After about a minute and a half of my wife and I awkwardly waiting for something to happen, she did finally ask what we wanted.   We mentioned that we had come for the pick up and another girl came to check us out.  Weird and bad service.  Our friends tell us that this young lady is usually a little rude- I wonder why the owners keep her in a place where she serves customers.    Food wise- it was ok.  Generously sized but kind of bland.  Good baba, but wraps were underwhelming.  It would have been better with some toppings like pickled onions or turnips to add some interest.   I don't think I'll be coming back.  Aladdin's is much better for my money."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the food here and am going back ASAP to get it again!   This is the best falafel I've had in the area. It's fried FRESH. It's not sitting out, pre made, so it's not dried out like it is at so many places. This stuff is so good. I got a falafel wrap and it was really delicious.   I also had the fries, hummus and hot sauce. The hummus is very lemony but I enjoyed it! It's very smooth. The hot sauce was delicious and I need to try the rest of their sauces, I think..   Friendly staff, very reasonable prices and fantastic food. It is all made when you order it so it's not ready immediately but it's worth the short wait. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Dolce Wraps staff are so friendly and helpful. There are many options on their Mediterranean/ Lebanese Menu and they will help you find the right thing! We love the beef shwarma over hummus and many of the wraps.  The white garlic sauce is great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing,  I usually get the falafel wrap but wanted to try something new, the girl that waited on us was so sweet and genuine.  Angie suggested the lamb wrap and how she enjoyed it and it was so amazing, my husband and I always enjoy there food, it is so flavorful and the staff is awesome!  I highly recommend everything from the hummus to the baba ganoush to the lamb and falafel!  Kudos to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The place to go for fast, inexpensive Middle Eastern Cuisine. They have some great home-made sauces which they also sell on the side in containers. The garlic is my favorite which I add to my wrap which is usually a veggie wrap of spinach, onion, hummus, (and other veggies) and sometimes i treat myself to lamb or steak. I usually can eat half for lunch and half for dinner since it is so large. The wrap is huge and not filled with rice unless of course that is what you want. The spinach pies are excellent and fresh. I have never tried the desserts but they look very tempting. The place is clean and quick and the staff is very friendly and patient while your making up your mind, as the menu is huge. I would be surprised that someone could not find something there they would like even if middle eastern is not your favorite !! Delicious food. Parking not a problem and since it is located at Westgate shopping mall there is plenty of surrounding businesses that will peak your interest. They even have a little cozy couch area which would be great on a date."}
{"text":"The first thing you'll notice about Dolce Wraps is that the name is completely wrong.  They are neither a dessert place nor a wraps place.  They're a Middle Eastern place - I mean, they serve wraps, certainly, but you're there mostly for the falafel or the tabbouleh or the other fine foods.  And they DO have a limited selection of desserts, but it's not really the highlight of the spot.    It's kind of like if McDonald's called itself \"Salads 'R' Us.\"  Or the Velvet Tango Room called itself \"Cheese Platter Heaven.\"  I mean, dude, your marketing is kind of at lacking here.  Which is a shame, because I suspect people are driving by this little, easily-overlooked spot and saying, \"Wow, I'd like some hummus, but that place serves wraps.\"    That aside, how's the food?  It's pretty good for what it is.  I feel like a choad here, leaving three stars when every other review is ZOMG BEST FOOD EVAR, but I gotta be honest - what you have here is inexpensive, passable middle eastern food that's the kind of food you could eat on a regular basis.  It satisfies your needs without necessarily excelling to the point of rhapsody - and it's at a price where you can go pretty much as often as you'd like.     The difference may be that I actually LIKE Aladdins, which everyone else here treats like it's the local indie band that made it big.  \"Oh, you like them?\" they sneer.  \"They sold out, man.  They sold out.\"  Then they smoke clove cigarettes and put on their fedoras and then go home and grow their own obscure vegetables you've never heard of.    Look, Aladdins is good food, if a little standardized.  Dolce Wraps is an independent store, and it is very pretty - the interior is surprisingly beautiful for a mall-based place.  You could sit there in quite a bit of comfort.  And the food is decent - I find the chicken to be a little stringy when I've gone there, and the hummus to be a little coarse and paste-like, and I'm not as sold on the sauces as everyone else.  But everything is very fresh, definitely not frozen in the back until you need it, and it's kind of hard to complain when you can get a full plate for $6.00.  A full meal here will go for $10.  That's a bargain, compared to the McDonald's or Chipotle's in the area.    In the end, Dolce Wraps is the local business I feel like I should frequent more often.  But when I feel like Middle Eastern, I either am not in the mood for their flavor of it, or I go to Aladdins, or I forget it's an option entirely.  Mostly it's the last reason, which is a shame.  Maybe it's the name.  But it's definitely worth hitting up to see whether you like it.  (EDIT: You know what?  I've taken off a star from enough restaurants for being overpriced.  On reconsideration, for such cheap and palatable eats, I've gotta add a star for being underpriced.  Four it is.)"}
{"text":"I was contemplating what to eat on Thursday, after a saturation of my usual food staples.  So, on the way home, I finally decided to stop off at Dolce Wraps.    The workers/management there are uber-helpful in describing the dishes and in helping me decide what to get.  They lay out all the sauces for you to try and sample with pita chips to help you decide.  My favorite sauces are the teriyaki, aglio, and the traditional sumac dressing.   I decided to get the House Special salad with chicken, salata, sumac dressing, etc.  The pita chips were crispy and super flavorful.  The chicken was cut into cubes/chunks in lieu of slices.  I wasn't a huge fan of that but, I thought the chicken was still tasty.  I love the amount of salata that they put on top of the salad and how crunchy and crispy all the veggies were.  I didn't like how they drenched the salad in dressing; each bite was dripping with dressing.    I also ordered a Dolce Wrap with bananas, apricots, brown sugar and walnuts.  I loved all the fruits in the wrap, but I wasn't too crazy about the walnuts.  The phyllo dough was a little less than crispy.   3.5 stars for the tasty menu and helpful service.  Less than 5 stars because of the okay dessert and the drenched salad.  Next time, I'll ask for dressing-on-the-side or try their teriyahi dishes.  I also really want to try their mango curry.  I'll be sure to update the next time I'm there!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Love love love it! They make the best dang falafel I have ever had in my life. Their hummus is also amazing, smooth, creamy and lemony, just like it should be. They offer a wide variety of sauces which are delicious and unique. They also have wonderful rice/veggie/meat combo plates tossed with their homemade sauces. The staff is so wonderfully friendly and get your food out to you very quickly. The prices are so great, my family of four can eat here for around $20 easily. Do yourself a favor and try this place!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting a chicken schawarma or shishtawook for days. I was up at Westgate and thought I'd try this out. Had a chicken pita wrap with the salata, garlic sauce, tahini and hot sauce. They then press it which makes the wrap warm and delicious. I was very glad I stopped and tried this. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Dolce wraps is a perfect,  affordable , filling , flavorful lunch and dinner spot. It tastes a hell of a lot better than Aladdin's .  What's amazing ? The fattoush salad , the chicken rice dishes , the wraps , the sneaky garlic sauce , the spices on the pita chips , the hot sauces ... seriously can keep going .  Whenever I am craving middle eastern style food , or hungry , or shopping near I stop and refill with the delicious food ."}
{"text":"We can all stop going to Aladdin's like mindless sheep for a falafal fix!  Dolce Wraps has saved us from their mediocrity.    Their perfectly crafted falafal are as good as you'll find on the Westside of Cleveland.  They also offer a good selection of sauces to give whatever you order another dimension of taste.  Don't forget about their desserts!  They offer one mean baklava."}
{"text":"Some of my favorites: Falafel wrap with baba and hot sauce added to it, or the lamb wrap with mango curry sauce garlic and tahini.   Veggie heaven is a great appetizer to split between two people."}
{"text":"I walked in here with the high hopes of the terrific meals I've gotten at the Westgate location, and walked out terribly disappointed.    The hummus was running and flavorless.  The falafel - which I've praised as one of my favorites in CLE - was oily and inedible.  My pita for the hummus was dry and stale.  When I pointed this out to the kid working behind the counter he looked at me like I was speaking in a different language.    For all the love and praise I've given to the Westgate location I am in awe as to how bad this location was.  Oh, and upon walking in the door all of their patio furniture was piled up by the entrance making it hard to even get it.  The owner really needs to spend more time at this location, or it will not last very long."}
{"text":"First time going here.  I was very impressed with the food and service.  I wanted to get one thing but the chef suggested something else.  I went with his choice and I was not disappointed at all.  I can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"Staff friendly, food tastes A-mazing and very reasonable prices. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Has some great vegan options and the workers are very helpful.  Everything is incredibly flavorful.  Keep doing what you do!"}
{"text":"Very good! The staff here is extremely friendly and helpful. I ordered a stir fry with a combination of sauces that was recommended by an employee and really enjoyed the food. The price was very reasonable for the portion sizes. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious wrap than chipolet... Signature dipping source are good with crispy pita. Hummus and falafel are also the must..."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great people. I love going in there because they always remember who I am and are excited for me to try something new. The people are really helpful too, since all the food isn't the most American-familiar."}
{"text":"Bigger, tastier wraps than Aladdins, same price. Quicker service. Hands down a great place. More recently the service has been sub par, so haven't been stopping as frequently."}
{"text":"Love it. Great food, great prices. I love the garlic sauce and always order the veggie heaven platter (make sure you check that your pita makes it in the bag) The decor is really cool and unexpected for a place in a strip mall. The name is super misleading, everyone I tell about it are surprised it's not Italian. But it's great Mediterranean fair. Everyone there will offer suggestions if you aren't sure what to get. And you get to sample all the sauces. I also recommend the desserts. There's a banana/dried fruit roll that is amazing."}
{"text":"5-star review for customer service. I was on my phone out in the parking lot trying to figure out when this place opened. Yelp didn't give me the hours and the website required Flash. I have an iPhone so I was SOL there. The open sign looked kinda like it might be on, but I wasn't sure. After hanging out for a bit, I decided to try the door and it was open. Turns out they didn't open until 11. I was there at 10:45 am. Oops. I was craving hummus on my way home from an appointment and I knew I passed this place, so I had my heart set on it. The friendly girl working took my order anyway! I told her I could go outside and wait, but she helped me. I left a bit of extra in the tip jar for her.   The wraps were good! The hummus could have used a bit more of a bite, but I thought it was tasty. Next time I'm going to try the falafel because I'll wait until they're actually open and ready.   One big suggestion to the owners or managers is to maybe put a sign on the door with the hours or put the business hours online somewhere so that mobile users can locate it. I felt awful ambushing the staff prior to opening."}
{"text":"Good but not great. The portion size is generous and the price is reasonable. The food tastes okay, the baba ghanoush was mediocre. Nothing is bad, I've just had better. The people working there are nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Best hummus and tabouli that I have had in Cleveland. The pita was so fresh and thin it was perfect."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood, running errands, during lunch and decided to stop here for the first time.  The menu was posted overhead, lots of choices!  The staff was super nice.  I ordered the Vegetarian Sampler which consisted of hummus, baba ghanouj, tabouli, falafel and a side of pita.  I am not a big fan of baba ghanouj, so I asked to substitute with an extra order of tabouli, which I love!   I paid the cashier and proceeded to sit in the dining area.  My food was hand delivered, just a few moments later.  The hummus was cool and creamy, just like, I like it.  The falafel was excellent, warm, crunchy and tasty.  The tabouli was just ok, lots more mint, than I prefer, but was still a great accompaniment to my meal.  I would absolutely return to Dolce.  The wraps look fantastic!"}
{"text":"Not consistent. The first time I went here I loved it. I had a falafel wrap and salad. Everything was fresh and delish.  The second time, the same order. Soggy, not good at all.   Today (for another chance at it) I went and bought a dolce salad and sampler side. The menu said the sampler side was 3.50 and I was charged 6.50.  The pita was dry and completely stale. I had nothing to dip into my hummus and sampler. Had to throw away the dry old pita. A very small bit of pita too, I might add.  I can tell a salad that has been sitting around for days a mile away. This salad (Dolce) was old lettuce, very old tomato olive relish. I ended up throwing that away too.  I am so disappointed, because I thought I found a good place for Mediterranian food.   .   Maybe Tuesday is their bad day? Or they are using the left overs from the weekend?  I ended up throwing away 13.00 worth of food. I did eat the falafel that came with the sampler and it was pretty good, But not the best I've had. ANd I wonder about the freshness of that before it was dipped in the frying oil.   I will not go back."}
{"text":"Really really liked my food! That being said, the girls that work in the restaurant were taking personal phone calls with their phone speaker on.... super unprofessional. Pretty disappointed and I don't know if I'll be back. Edit: the manager has been made aware of the situation and I think that it is awesome how quickly this was addressed! Kudos to Missy!"}
{"text":"This one is for the rocky river one. The avon one is nothing to write about.  The reviews at this location of dolce wraps prompted me to try it out. Hard to locate it on the GPS but it is in the mall opposite chipotle, same area as the pearle vision.  Tried two wraps: the mango curry wrap and the Moroccan wrap. The first one was exceptional. Very tasty. The second one good except for the vinegar turnip which was inside the wrap. Portion is huge. Definitely can share or make it your dinner and lunch.  I am craving for it as I am writing this review. Will be back soon. They have a variety of veg and chicken options"}
{"text":"Excellent food choices and the wraps are simply amazing!! My favorite is the garlic sauce!! Yummmmy! When I'm in town again I will visit :)"}
{"text":"Had great lentils and rice and tabbouleh.  haven't made it back to try anything else, but want to!  Seemed like it's in the Chipotle price range for a meal.  2/15/2010:  have been back several times and am becoming a fan of the Chicken Pitarito Wrap and  the Chicken Curry Wrap (and I have never found a curry I haven't HATED)  their sweet curry sauce is pretty darn good.  Just one word of advice about the wraps ask for them \"toasted\" and you will be back.  You can sample the different sauces at the counter with fried pita chips."}
{"text":"What a great, random find! Mediterranean wraps and plates, made from scratch, and very affordable. Tried the steak signature plate - salad, rice, strips of marinated beef with that awesome garlic sauce! Wow!!! You order and pay at the counter and they bring your food to your table. The interior is pretty nicely decorated. They have a pretty extensive menu and lots of stuff sounds really good! Will definitely be back to try other items!"}
{"text":"The chicken here is very flavorful. I really like the mango curry. I usually get the stir frys. Just tried the baklava today and it's the best I've ever had! Highly recommend for lunch!"}
{"text":"Always gotten good food, but I'm standing here right now, watching as a girl repeatedly touches her face, nose and hair, plus handles the money. Then jumps over to assist with food prep. So, I asked for her coworker to make my food and Poor Hygiene Girl made a snide comment under her breathe. Never again."}
{"text":"The service was great first and for most that was awesome.  I had the Lamb wrap with extra lamb. Hummus with hot sauce and garlic. I am a true fan of Aladdin's.  Dolce wrap was good. I would go back and try some other things. The couple things I would have complain about would be.  The lamb when they put on the grill got burnt on the outside. Lamb does not taste good slightly charred.  The pita and hummus. If you do not buy extra pita it comes with 3/4 small wedges.  If you ask for extra at other places they give it to you. They expect you to buy a bag a of Pita. I think  if I order large Hummus it should come with more pita then the small one. That is just my opinion."}
{"text":"Dolce Wraps or if you were to consider the Italian meaning of it - Smooth Wraps are indeed smooth to one's middle eastern food craving.  Let me say this though - there's nothing Italian about the wraps, plates, appetizers, or sides offered up here.  Its middle eastern flare all the way.  The food truly shines at Dolce.  The star attractions wraps - are served made to order, can be customized for heat, and can be toasted for a crunchy bites.  The various plate dishes are well prepared and served - something that is pleasing to the eye as well as to the your taste buds.  I truly love the various sauces at Dolce Wrap - aglio, chipotle pepper, spicy terriyaki - adorn the vegetarian or non-veg wraps with sweet spicy kick that's sure to get you hooked.   Dolce Wraps never skimp on the stuffing in the wraps - I have yet to be able to finish a whole wrap along with some sides on any of my repeated visits.  The wraps can almost be shared between two people.   You will also find Panini sandwich, Soups, Salads, Plates, and Smoothies on the menu.  All wraps can be made into a plate and almost any of the plates can be made into a wrap -  this might sound trivial but many wrap places actually don't do this. Sicilian Chicken plate is one of the more popular plates on their menu.  Once you walk in, you are greeted with some cozy dark couches, bar-tables, and a fire-place.  Upon your first visit you might wonder if the front seating area is for enjoying coffee - however, I have not seen any barista coffee on the menu at Dolce Wraps.  Upon my repeated visits here I have concluded that this front space is probably for lounging as you feel the post dining coma.  The rest of the space (the whole length of the restaurant left) contains booths and free-standing tables and chairs.  Its always very clean inside and despite the spicy cooking involving the menu, the spice smells are never overpowering.  Dolce Wraps has continued to maintain a great quality offering since they opened 2 years or so ago.  My repeat visits have always left me fully satisfied and pleased with their food.  The prices are very affordable given the quality and quantity offered. The service is never pretentious.  Dolce is a family friendly spot at the edge of Westgate mall where you can easily get hooked for light to moderately heavy middle eastern food.  Why didn't I review this place sooner if I've been going here for last 2 years ? - because sometimes I can be lazy :-)"}
{"text":"The best place ever! Old co-worker told me about this place. Been going here for awhile. Best food and service."}
{"text":"MUCH improved on our last visit -- maybe it was just an \"off\" night. Hummus was awesome, as was the fatoosh."}
{"text":"I am definitely updating my review to 5 stars after eating at Dolce Wraps several more times  since my first visit earlier this year.  I think I must have been having a bad day or just not ordered my favorite dish the first time.  I also hadn't had the extras- the best part- hummus, baba, and tabouli. Their baba is some of the best I've ever tried. The hummus is excellent too.   As I said before, they have a large menu with excellent prices. Very very cheap for what you get. Everything I've had has been a pretty large serving. Their wraps are some of the biggest I've ever seen, not your typical wrap at all. After having several other entrees and sides, I regret saying that I wasn't impressed with the quality of the food on my first visit. Everything here is cooked fresh and served hot. It has a very home-made taste and everything has been fresh (including the tomatoes) each time I've been here.   Have to say also that the girls who prepare the food here are so nice. It's the closest to Southern hospitality that I've seen in this area. They act like they enjoy making the food and making sure that you are pleased with it.   I have been recommending this place to my friends on the west side who enjoy ethnic/Mediterranean foods."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty. I had ordered the Moroccan steak wrap, the wife got the hummus chicken wrap and we got sauce sampler with pita chips and a veggie sampler. All was around $30. Plus drinks not so bad."}
{"text":"The girls who were working were very helpful and the Chicken Hummus wrap was better than I even could've expected.   Definitely worth the stop and the money.  The wrap was huge & very flavorful!"}
{"text":"Oh my, shame on me. Every time I drove past their sign and saw the D and the W in Disney typeface, I cringed. I presumed that the food inside must be as poorly done as the sign outside - wrong. Wrong wrong wrong.   Super friendly counter service, DELICIOUS hummus and falafel, my friend's Sicilian beef was good he said, and my curry chicken was good (but I look forward to trying something else). The prices are so low that it's being added to my lunch pick up rotation even when I'm scraping the bottom of my wallet.  The only meh thing was the Lady Gaga bumping out of the speakers. At least it provided some entertaining dinner conversation.  I cannot wait to go back and try more, shame on me for my jerk graphic designer snap judgments (but at least it wasn't Zapfino)."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick dinner before a movie. Food was good for the price. Nothing to rave about, but the portion sizes were larger than expected. I got a hummus wrap that filled my tummy but didn't leave me necessarily wanting to go back for more.  I believe a friend got a lentil and rice dish that did good so if I go back, I think I will try that.  They also have a small assortment of desserts and who can resist baklava?  The interior is nicer than expected with comfy booths and chairs.  It's a nice option to have close to the movies if you don't want to go to Applebees or Chipotle."}
{"text":"It's crazy to think that the price points between a place like Dolce Wraps and Pita Pit are apples to apples, because the difference in flavor is night and day!  It's going to sound cliché but I'd had Pita Pit and then Dolce Wraps in the same week and you could definitely tell which one was 'made with love' ok maybe not love but definitely made with a hefty amount of 'like'.  Dolce incorporated those unique Mediterranean flavors into each ingredient I had in my wrap. From the jasmine rice, to the zesty tahini sauce, the parsley, ripe tomatoes, fresh crunchy onions, the garlic, natural spices in each bite of steak. Everything was packaged into a presumably homemade pita wrap and sealed to perfection.  I had a teriyaki steak wrap and they have an instant fan in this guy right here. I even got one for lunch the next day. My GF got the falafel. I had a bite and it was perfectly fried with toasted sesame seeds, all the fixins and fresh vegetables that go along with it.  Unique twist on fast casual, extremely delicious. You can bet based on this initial go that I'll be a regular! Thanks for your creativity and delivery!"}
{"text":"They have decent food. I've had the Moroccan chicken plate and the hummus plate. I usually replace the rice with lentil and rice which is just 25 cents more. But overall the food is extremely salty! Everything from the lentil to the hummus and the chicken.  I originally started coming here thinking it was a healthy choice with lean meats and lentils but I think all the salt counterbalances that. I wish they had more flavors via spices rather than salt. I've had Aladdin's lamb wrap once and it wasn't as salty and had more flavor and overall felt lighter and fresher."}
{"text":"Fiesta steak wrap, outstanding. We ask for lettuce and not rice in the wrap. Don't forget the side of falafel! The chipotle sauce is WOW! Very good service.  Try the chip and dip combo, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I am giving this four stars because the food was unique, the atmosphere was very nice, and the staff was extremely friendly. It's a great concept - if you like the food. The pita chips and hummus dip were great! However, I didn't particularly care for the middle east spices that were on my sandwich. Still, the quality was excellent."}
{"text":"Adding a star since this place has consistently been satisfying in taste, portion size, and price. Sure it's no Cafe Falafel, but it's close to me and get's the job done."}
{"text":"First of all, a qualification - Dolce Wraps is not a 5-star restaurant on par with the best fine dining establishments in the Cleveland area, but it delivers on what it offers.  That is fresh-tasting food at a very reasonable price.  Have returned for a second visit in the span of a week since first checking it out.  Both times, I had the grilled lamb wrap, and the second time I went for double meat.  The ingredients are fresh, and the spices make the food interesting.  My wife enjoys the Sicilian Plate, and my daughter has enjoyed the wraps she has tried, too.  For the little ones who like quesadillas, they are massive!  Final note - on my last visit, I had a large order.  There was a miscommunication, and my wife's Sicilian Plate was made into a wrap.  When I brought this to the attention of the young lady who was preparing the food, she did not hesitate to make the dish and include it to my order at no extra charge.  So, we got a Sicilian wrap for free - and I enjoyed it for lunch the next day!  If you're shopping in Avon Commons, try this place instead of the chain restaurant options nearby."}
{"text":"Amazing service & cozy atmosphere. One of my favorite places to go! And everyone is so nice  everything on the menu is delicious. Current fave: chicken morracan plate.  TRY IT! Thank me later"}
{"text":"Dolce Wraps is probably my favorite restaurant in the Cleveland area. I don't see how their the combination of flavor, service, and value can be beat. They offer a wide variety of middle eastern themed dishes, wraps, and sandwiches. My favorite thing to get is stir fry with a mixture of their homemade sauces (all are extremely delicious) which comes loaded with fresh veggies. Their staff is always extremely friendly and helpful, food is prepared in minutes and brought to your table, and all at a price point that competes even with fast food chains."}
{"text":"I've had better and I've had worse. In my rating system 3 stars means \"good,\" and that's what I'd say about Dolce Wraps; it's good.   On the positive side, the taboule salad was better than many Mediterranean places around town, and I liked their babaganoush quite a bit.   On the downside, the hummus was rather flavorless and the falafel were just a tad overcooked for my liking, but that also seems to be a trend in the area, so maybe it's just me. I'm French afterall so what do I actually know about authenticity in Mediterranean cuisine (aside from my BFF being Lebanese)?   The dining room is clean, as was the grill behind the counter. The service was efficient, but maybe lacked in the \"friendly\" category, but nothing outrageous or offensive in any way.   In the end I wouldn't hurry back, but if I found myself on this side of town, I wouldn't avoid Dolce Wraps either."}
{"text":"I feel like this place gets overlooked because it's in a plaza but make sure you give it a chance! It is super tasty Mediterranean food! I've had the Moroccan chicken wrap, the corned beef wrap, and the falafel. My fiancé has had the lamb and loves it. Their wraps are huge and so delicious !  Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"So, we have been going here for years and the past few times the service seems to have slipped. Today we ordered & half our food was missing. I called to ask them to credit our charge for what we didn't receive and was told they didn't know how. However, we were more than welcome to come get the rest of our order, but with a screaming 7 month old and a tired 5 year old, that was not gonna happen. They took our name and said we are owed a freebie next visit. Right now, i am unsure when that may be as i am super disappointed! Not what i have come to expect. I am hoping this was a lapse and not a jump the shark moment. It is now 2 hours later and the kiddos are asleep. My very hungry husband now has to shell out more money, as he is still starving"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I got a chicken wrap today and I'm already thinking about my next visit"}
{"text":"What a great hidden place to eat.  I know Aladdins is great and I'm a huge fan but I encourage everyone to try this place.  Its in the plaza facing Chipotle in Westgate mall plaza (Target and Kohls area).  The selection is huge and I make it a point to come here whenever I'm at Target or my parents.  I could be wrong but I also think this place is less expensive than Aladdins as well.  Next time you are slumming it in Rocky River, I encourage you to try this place.  One of my favorite quick eats"}
{"text":"So I really have to give it up to Dolce Wraps. Wasn't 100% with it when I ordered  my delivery and missed that it was 11 miles from my hotel. That poor guy drove 22 miles round trip for a $5 tip, so for that, my bad dude. I owe you many beers and a fat tip.   I got the falafel and a lamb wrap. Both were good, if on the cold side (I wonder why asshole!). The falafels were not what I expected, but I'd never had them before and got them on a whim. They were good and the odd, thin, white sauce that they paired with was AWESOME. No doubt they'd've been amazing fresh off line. The wrap was massive, definitely enough for a single bloke. Give them a try if you're in the area, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their vegan dishes especially the falafel wrap with baba on the side"}
{"text":"Visited again yesterday and had a very good experience.    I had the Felafel wrap with added hummus again and it was very fresh and a tantalizing amalgam of flavors that may well approach Dolce Wraps boast that they have the best felafel in town.  The hummus was thick on this one which is a point of inconsistency when added to the felafel wrap.  Sometimes you can barely tell it's there.  One other inconsistent aspect is the presence of onions.  Sometimes you get them on the felafel wrap and other times you do not.  They menu does not mention them and when I have asked for it without the onions they tell me it does not come with onions.  Yesterday there were very large fresh hunks of onion.  I like onion, so no personal problem, but I often order this for SO who will not eat an item with onions.  They should straighten that one out.   The only other detriment was they were out of the veg chili which is excellent when served warm.  The service was well above expectation from the woman who took my order over the phone and did her best to present me with options with the chili 86'd to recognizing that I must be the call-in order having skipped the order station at pick-up without having to ask me.  The great tone and presence in our interaction was a much improved experience over the last visit.    I secretly which to eat there again today if that wasn't n such a ridiculous idea.  Good show, Dolce."}
{"text":"Mediterranean fast food at its best.  Move over gyro there's a new kid in town. Whether dining in or getting takeout the food is always prepared fresh in front of you. The employees there are all friendly and very helpful if you're a first timer or a regular."}
{"text":"I am a longtime lover of Aladdins but I can't stand the parking situation at the local restaurants. I recently stumbled upon Dolce Wraps and woah! I had the falafel salad and the lentil soup. The salad was very good and the lentil soup was the best I have ever tasted! I loved the cozy ambiance and the service was excellent. The woman who assisted us was very helpful and overly kind. She recommended tweeks to the menu items and I was beyond satisfied. She was beyond courteous. My only complaint is that they had no fresh silverware for eating in. We had to use plastic utensils which sounds trite but I really dislike plastic utensils. When I asked another employee about utensils she told me they were all out of silverware and she seemed somewhat annoyed that I even asked for them.  Ps. I have celiac disease and the woman who served us was very knowledgable about gluten and reassured me that the items I chose were gluten free."}
{"text":"I've been to the Dolce Wraps in Westgate & I really liked it so, I decided to try this location out since it's nearest to me.  The employees were really helpful & friendly. Unfortunately, that's the only thing that I liked. My sister & I got our order to go. When we went to eat our food, we realized they messed up her order but she still ate it anyway. We couldn't even finish our wraps, it was LOADED with garlic & spice! I couldn't taste the chicken or anything else in the wrap. It was just to overpowering. I love garlic & spice, don't get me wrong...but to have THAT much in a dish is just insane. Wow."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming a go-to staple for when I want something fast and semi-healthy.  Well not really healthy but still delicious.  Dolce wraps is the love child from one of the former owners of Aladdins who wanted to break off and start his own place.  He is always there offering advice as to what to order and to tell you what goes in each wrap.   He also uses most of the same sauces that Aladdins uses, including that amazing hot sauce.  The only difference is that this place is a couple bucks cheaper and quicker.  Also, the chicken does taste a little different and the side of hot sauce they give you is smaller but I'll manage.  My go-to is the curry chicken wrap with garlic and hot sauce.  It's big enough to last for a couple of meals and even tastes good cold the next day.  The beef is a tad bit dry but the sauce tends to mask it a bit.  The falafel is crispy and delicious and the egg plant wrap is fulfilling, although they do put french fries in it which is a bit of an overkill. Go there and order the chicken wrap!  It's delicious."}
{"text":"Today I gave this place a second try. The first time I ever went there I got a falafel wrap with hummus and tabouli. Ofcourse, I had to add hot sauce. The flavor was good, however there was huge chunks of lettuce and onion that were not appealing.  Today I ordered a dozen falafel to go and a large order of tabouli. To my surprise I got a huge container of tahini which was phenomenal; very lemony and perfect to dip the falafel in. I was not impressed by the tabouli. Definitely not enough lemon juice, parsley was not finely chopped and neither were the tomatoes and the onions. Would I go back? Just for the crispy delicious falafel."}
{"text":"Oh, Dolce Wraps. I was looking for a lunch place near my job in Westlake, and found Dolce Wraps on Yelp. I'm so happy I did! I ended up coming here several times per week for lunch. The food is delicious- I love everything I tried. I generally switched between the Falafel Wrap with hummus and hot sauce, the Rotisserie Chicken Wrap with apricot chipotle sauce, and the Chicken Moroccan wrap which had a yummy whipped garlic sauce! Amazing! And these pita wraps are HUGE! Enough to last me 2 lunches, a really great deal for under $7.  The service is amazing, as well. The ladies behind the counter are super friendly and accommodating, as is the (assumed) owner who is often standing nearby. Although I was only in Cleveland for 3 months, I was quickly recognized as a \"regular customer\" which was really awesome. I wish I could take Dolce Wraps back home to Connecticut with me!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great selection! Humus is awesome and lentil soup is good. My wife and I love Dolce Wraps and so has everyone we've taken there."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I live in Chicago now, but every time I'm in Cleveland, I make sure to stop by here!  I love the Rotissary Chicken wrap (Its big enough for 2 meals), and the baba ganouj.  mmmm... I had it last weekend, and I'm still smiling when I think about it."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food around! I get something new every time I go and have yet to be disappointed. I recently got the falafel wrap which was absolutely delicious. Every time I go I always get the dips. The garlic dip is my favorite! Next time you need a quick bite to eat, forget your standard fast food restaurants and cafes and go here!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.   The food is always so fresh and flavorful. There are lots of choices. You can do plates of different foods, wraps or stir fries.  Personally I crave the teriyaki chicken plate. With some hummus on the side.   We use Dolche Wraps a lot for work meetings. They are so great. We order ahead of time and it is ready when we go to pick it up. They even put names on each of the boxes so we know who gets what.   The restaurant has a good amount of seating. The staff always is smiling, patient and helpful. I highly recommend stopping in :)"}
{"text":"Good but plenty of room for improvement.   Start out with Chicken Curry if you're new to this genre.  Was left a little disappointed. Will give them another shot."}
{"text":"My heart was broken to get there after way too long to find Dolce Wraps closed! Nothing fancy, but they were the best restaurant in Avon. Everything I've ever had here was beyond excellent and I was looking forward to trying everything on the menu, trusting that I wouldn't ever be disappointed. Best gyro ever! Sauces that will blow your mind. My mouth is watering just thinking about the place. Please come back!!!"}
{"text":"The service is usually very friendly, the food is always amazing! I love the baba ganoush and aglio sauce with pita. Super yum!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Dolce Wraps in Fairview Park for over a year now. I love Aladdin's,  but this place serves up some delicious food. I usually stick to the Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food (meaning no french fries, corned beef wrap, or turkey gruyere wrap for example).   My faves are the chicken hummus plate, chicken Moroccan plate and falafel wrap. And it's enough food that I usually end up splitting with someone. They serve a lot of the foods with an aglio dip, which is pretty potent (garlicky), but very tasty!  Every time I've gone there, service has been wonderful.  Very friendly, able to answer questions or make suggestions. I've eaten in and ordered to go, and no issues either way. I would definitely recommend trying Dolce Wraps in Fairview Park!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  Yummy, healthy inexpensive and fast.  What a fantastic experience !!"}
{"text":"Things I love about Dolce Wraps:   -the falafel!!! So much better than Aladdin's and one of the things I just crave sometimes. And love the pickled veg in the wraps. -the hilarious characters who work there. They've been known to hassle my husband for not getting hot sauce on our wraps AKA they know us better than we know ourselves. Not everyone is super-friendly, I will admit that, but at the same time I've never walked out with a negative vibe. One time I got a wrap for free because whoever was working the register was in the back smoking and I had to wait for like five minutes to pay. The other person behind the counter (I'm assuming the manager) was PISSED and started throwing pans around and cursing right in front of me. The more I write this, the more it doesn't seem like a positive but honestly it was just kind of endearing to me. Plus, free food. -the value! Helloooo who doesn't love getting some extra pita and hummus?  One thing I just can't get over is that sometimes there are flies having a field day in that place. Usually we do carry-out anyway but still - ugh. Whateves, I'm too enamored with their falafel to stop going there."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, great food.With amazing people and incredible cuisine. Manages to infuse quite a few different ethnics cuisines into a concise menu with huge portions. Great flavors, fresh foods MTO."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great price. I recommend the Moroccan lamb wrap, falafel hummus, the rotisserie chichen stir fry and try all the sauces first. Combining them is everthing. Nice, clean environment, friendly, fast staff. Everything you want!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Wraps are about $6 which is great, and even their fountain drinks are better then most (I forgot the brand ) the home made sauces are excellent, and you can try samples at the counter to see what you like.  And the decor inside sets a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem. I honestly didn't expect Middle Eastern restaurant with such a name. My wife and I always order from this establishment and we always are impressed. The one thing I always get is the Sicilian chicken wrap which is phenomenal. I would also recommend any of their homemade sauces because that is what really makes this place unique."}
{"text":"I want to be fair - I've only had this once but I was extremely underwhelmed. That's the only way I can describe it. It wasn't bad per say. I just wasn't impressed.   I had the morrocan chicken wrap. I admit I got no salata but I'm not a fan of raw tomatoes. I had rice, greens, chicken, garlic sauce. I was super excited to eat this and was still indifferent. I didn't finish it. I also had fries which were bleh. She sprinkled them with seasoning but when I tried them I was confused, there was not one grain of salt in the seasoning put on top. Disappointed bc they were probably fresh cut.   I will try once again because I want falafel. Not a big fan."}
{"text":"I just love their Sicilian Plate and Fattoush Salad.  I have no idea why anyone would go next door to The Pita Pit when authentic Middle Eastern food is here.  The prices are very budget friendly, service is quick and friendly.  I've never been disappointed, and it's nice to know I can rely on Dolce Wraps for  a quick, affordable, healthy and delicious meal."}
{"text":"Is this the best ever place? Nah. It's pretty good, but I also rate it a 4/5 due to the service and their ability to handle several people with specific requirements. A group 8 or 9 of us stopped in an hour before close. I used to work in food service, so I'm sure that wasn't ideal. Even if they were groaning internally, the staff was all extremely pleasant and helpful. Only a few of us had ever been there, so the rest of us basically had no idea what sort of food they even offered. As I mentioned, a few people have particular allergies and I've seen waiters get a bit annoyed, but the staff was great about it (and even checked to make sure every item, including a sauce was gluten free for one of my best friends with a serious gluten allergy. For real, don't cross contaminate her, it's BAD NEWS).   I was pretty happy with the variety of items offered - it can sometimes be difficult to please all people in this group. I don't think anyone had leftovers. I ended up with a Turkey Wrap, but switched out the sauces (sorry I don't remember which one I ended up with). I wasn't expecting anything life changing but it totally hit the spot and the sauces they have (which they let us all sample) are great. The hummus is wonderful - definitely order it if you stop in here. I still prefer Alladin's hummus or my home made hummus, but this is better than most places (I like to mix in a bit of a hot sauce and some garlic sauce. But I feel you can almost never go wrong with garlic. I am shocked that I can still get people to make out with me).   The only thing that I wouldn't ever order again was the falafel. It wasn't bad at all, but it didn't have as much flavor as I'm used to. The rice is really great. Next time I may get a side of it to go, so I have something tasty in my lunch. Regardless of what you end up with, it's a pretty good value. You do get a good amount of food for what you pay. I've seen a certain member of our party put back as much food as 3 of us and then still have room, and one plate of their food worked for him.   We were there until close, but didn't realize it because the staff was so chill. Once we realized it was closing time, the staff still wasn't pushing us out (I'll be honest, I have done this or at least made it abundantly clear that it is Closing Time Now). Instead, the staff chatted with us and said no rush. They did kind of make fun of us because it was a Saturday and we weren't going out to party."}
{"text":"now i wont go aladin :) i loved it so much. we tried pita pit first and did not like there."}
{"text":"Great hummus, tabbouleh, and falafel. Mediocre Babba ghanoush was too thin. What was infuriating was that all 4 of those item were slipped into one container without dividers. I drove 1.6 miles home to find a sloppy mess. Everything in the container was mixed into a big pile. Not cool. The counter service was very nice but the mess I wound up with was not good eats."}
{"text":"Wow...amazing and such a great value.  Wish we lived closer!!!!"}
{"text":"Good price, and consistently good food. Food is comparable to Aladdin's. Difference between the two being atmosphere & ordering process. It is also nice to see the same welcoming familiar faces!  My go-to is the Lamb Plate. Wraps and hummus are great as well. I'm a fan of the lamb, but if it doesn't suit your taste good with the chicken!"}
{"text":"Came here on the review of fellow Yelpers.  Place was dead on a Saturday ( only one lady eating ).  Very posh for a wrap place.  Three people working yet one girl doing the register, grilling and prepping food.  Took 5 minutes to even place an order then literally it took over 10 minutes to get 2 wraps and an overpriced brownie.  The two other people working were doing prep work 2 feet away from me and could not say Hello, FU or anything...  First impressions go a long way with me.  After we got our food an older couple came in and they got the gold treatment.  Had I been explained the menu I would of ordered differently.  The stuff has zero explanation on whats doin on each sandwich.   Didnt know there we so many sauce options and that there were pickled veg on there..etc.  Sandwiches were OK....a bit over the top.  I like a more street food/simple ingredient sandwich but thats not what Yelp is about for a lot of people.  I would try again but would be nice to know my options."}
{"text":"The food, the service, the decor, the prices, the atmosphere... Truly all amazing! Definitely a place that needs to be tried out if you are in the area! I got the grilled chicken with the apricot sauce, and it was seriously soooooo amazing!"}
{"text":"Really like this place. I'm still fine tuning my order. Started with a chicken hummus wrap(with garlic sauce of course!), found the chicken was flavorless and a little dry/stringy. Also got a side of falafel which was good, especially with the (mystery)dipping sauce it came with. Asked my g/f if we could back again less than a week later, tried the hummus wrap( w/ garlic sauce). Very tasty, a better fit for me than the chicken wrap. I think I will have found the sweet spot on my next visit. Going to get a falafel and hummus wrap! And they don't seem to want to offer it as a topping but I'm gonna ask to get some tabbouleh put on as well.   Be sure to sample the sauces they offer too!!! The apricot-chipotle(i think) is AMAZING!!! Gonna take some home with me next time. That little cup of sauce will probably get me through a whole bag of pita chips at home.   If you've ever been to Denver and had Garbanzo's you are likely desperately searching for something to fill that void, as I am. This is as close as I've gotten.  Staff is great and very friendly/welcoming, restaurant is clean and comfortable. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. The service is fantastic, the prices are great, and best of all this place is consistent each and every time. Sauces are laid out with pita chips to find something that you're looking for, and the staff gives good suggestions. I'm a fan of the lamb wraps, and get the hot sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Initially driving up to Dolce, I briefly glimpsed at the sign and thought it said Disney World. Disney World it was not, but Dolce was cheap and fast, just the way I like my lunch.  I opted for the steak and hummus plate with the jasmine rice. Upon mentioning no pita bread, they asked if I was Gluten Free. Without hesitation and asking, they switched gloves to avoid possible cross contamination. This in my eyes is huge and worth extra brownie points.   The food was good and the portion sizes were huge. I felt bad because I ended up leaving half my meal behind. If I have the chance, I would dine at Dolce again."}
{"text":"Ate here twice a year ago, when two of my friends were working here. Was treated to a lamb wrap, so very good. The second time a few weeks later, decided to test out the hummus sampler for lunch. It comes with an additional bag of pitas to purchase.I thought I'd have enough but went back in line to get more pitas and they cleaned up the hummus! Still some in there, but doesn't matter didn't feel like complaining but you seem to need to leave a note for them or something! At least it's clean in there. Was decent fresh food."}
{"text":"I've only recently gotten into falafel, honestly. It wasn't my middle Eastern cup of tea, but these are just the best - watching them prepare and get them up in front of you just send to make them taste better.  I am very particular about my hummous, because my favorite little shop in Detroit does it so well. Dolce's is a solid effort - super smooth and creamy, but missing a little something for my taste. Lemon? Salt? Not sure.  My chicken wrap was enormous and tasty, with the kind of garlic sauce I crave.  I ordered a wrap, a small side of hummous and falafel, and this big guy took some of everything home.  Four stars for being cheap, tasty, generous, atmospheric, and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh middle easter food! The faffel is freshly made to order (so is everything else that they make!). The service is wonderful and the prices are perfect! I would recommend this place to anyone! Great, healthy food at a great price!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick and easy lunch. I got the falafel wrap, my boyfriend got the steak hummus wrap, both were delicious. The people working there were super helpful and super nice. Will definitely go back. Really nice that you can try the sauces before you order."}
{"text":"Really like Dolce Wraps. All the ingredients are fresh and and service is quick. An added bonus- you don't feel like you just got \"the diabetus\" when you leave, like 90% of the choices nearby. Try the chicken or steak wraps with hummus and pita. Salad is really nice too."}
{"text":"Very impressed in the quality of food, great place to stop for lunch if you are around Westlake Mall"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The chicken curry wrap is a go-to sandwich anytime I am running around Fairview Park. Nice alternative to Chipotle and other fast food joints there.   The flavored iced teas are great, everything tastes very fresh and the people couldn't be nicer."}
{"text":"Super awesome secret under the radar place. Love everything they have here. The food the service the atmosphere. Nothing is lacking. Ashley has always been the best of the best service wise making excellent recommendations and making each dish with care.   I tend to favor the fiesta garlic and hot sauces with a chicken platter. Well seasoned & sauced. Their spinach pies are solid and pita wraps handle their business.   Want your taste buds rocked? Eat here."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in the whole Cleveland area! It's quick like fast food but delicious. You've got to try the hummus! Better than anywhere else I've ever had. Definitely get a wrap. Try the chicken. Actually try everything!. Homemade baklava. Homemade ethnic desserts. Homemade pita. Capital L-O-V-E it! I've actually told him several times their signature sauces need to be bottled and sold at grocery stores everywhere! They be billionaires."}
{"text":"Falafel wrap was very good -- made to order, and super fresh tomatoes and lettuce :) The fries were overcooked and didn't taste quite right.  Service was slow, but the place was very clean and inviting."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great menu!Everything is fresh! This is one of my favorite places to eat! Salata is sooo good...and I normally don't like salad! Flavors from mild to spicy. Extensive menu. A must eat!"}
{"text":"First time here, I love the family atmosphere and the amount of flavor that comes out of these sauces is amazing. We chose the mango curry sauce on lamb and chicken stir fry. It was incredible. Don't pass this place up its a totally worth while investment if you're looking for culture in the burbs"}
{"text":"I love Dolce Wraps! I came here a few times on lunch break with some fellow teachers and was pleasantly surprised. The first time we came the line was almost out the door. The workers seemed very flustered and one was yelling at another. However, once we finally got our food we were all so happy. I ordered a hummus chicken plate and it was delicious. There are so many options to try. All of the sauces are so so good as well! They let you try them as you walk in the door and you can add whichever you want to almost anything. Once you order, they will bring the food out to your table for you, which I liked. The second time we visited, we called ahead and the place was empty when we arrived (figures!). The staff was much friendlier and less stressed and the food was still awesome!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times since my original review and it has become my go-to restaurant for falafel hummus wraps. Outstanding. Several great veg options on the menu. The staff in Avon and Fairview Park are always friendly."}
{"text":"So I leave Home Depot and decide I want a wrap. I figured we would check out Dolce Wraps but when we walked in and peeked at a menu we almost left because it said it was Mediterranean food. I have nothing against the food genre but I'm more of a steak and potatoes, pizza, burgers and fries kinda guy. Being tired and already in the door we decided to break out of our box and explore. I need to get out of my box more often if I'm gonna keep discovering gems like this.   We tried the Chicken Hummus wrap with hot sauce, a gyro wrap and a chicken stir fry. All were amazing. The chicken hummus wrap with hot sauce was my favorite between itself and the gyro wrap. The stir fry was ridiculously delicious! The sauce they use is very light and flavorful and all of the ingredients were fresh just like the wraps. Everything was very well prepared which made for a very easy and clean eating experience, especially with the wraps because everything stayed intact. The environment was very clean and the staff was friendly, patient and inviting.   If you haven't been to Dolce yet then get over to the Avon Commons immediately. Just look for the Disney World font lol. I actually thought it was a Disney World store for awhile. Never really read the name. Just saw the fancy font of the \"D\" and \"W\" lol. But anyways, yeah I will definitely be back and you need to go.."}
{"text":"One might be tricked into thinking they're walking into a Disney store with that sign font, but don't worry... this stuff is fantastic.   Dolce Wraps has all the usuals, tabboleh, hummus, falafel made right in front of you. I regularly order the falafel wrap with hummus and hot sauce. But, its their more inventive dishes that make this place stand out. The califry wrap is where its at. Grilled cabbage, fresh cut French fries, garlic sauce, tahini, and various other yumminess. So. Good. And on the rare occasion I don't want a wrap, the Fattoush Salad is also tantalizing, with chopped up tomatoes and onions and greens, fried pita as croutons, and garnished by mint, olive oil, and lemon.   Now my mouth is watering...  Don't forget the desserts! Baklava is always awesome."}
{"text":"I'm sure all of the food is delicious, but I can only speak to the hummus, pita, and falafel wrap with hummus added. I just haven't been able to break away from those choices, as I love love love that wrap so much. I've never dined in, but the staff at the counter have always been nice. Food is always made quickly. I feel a little guilty giving a 5 star rating to a place I've never dined in, and have only eaten one dish; at the same time I've ordered from here dozens of times, and the food is perfect every time, so 5 stars it is."}
{"text":"Hooray!  A yummy Middle Eastern food place!  After leaving the east side of Michigan, man did I not realize how good the middle Eastern food was, until I moved away! Ever since I've moved to Cleveland, I've been on the hunt for some good fast food Middle Eastern food.  And Dolce Wraps delivers!  What a name. And the font of the sign is so Disney-like, it definitely threw me off. Huh? Middle Eastern food in that place? No way!  And it's cheap too. Double plus.  We ordered the chicken moroccan plate. Oh man. YUM. The meat was cooked well, spiced perfectly, with good rice and salad on the side. We ordered some hummus as well, which was nice and smooth.  But man, the AGLIO (aka garlic sauce). BEST GARLIC SAUCE EVER!! There was one place in Ann Arbor that I liked to frequent for its garlic sauce, but nothing compared to Dolce Wraps- it's like this spicy hot garlic sauce that they give you, on the side, to compliment your food. Oh man, expect bad breath, but if you love garlic...Mmmm...winner!  And the owners were nice. My bf went to ask for a lid for our hummus...the owner asked him to hand him our hummus bowl, and the owner slopped some more hummus in it, and gave us a lid. We were a little flabbergasted- HUH???? haha. It was nice though- what a plus. :)  Great service, great food, and hey, you can do your shopping at Earthfare afterwards. :)"}
{"text":"The dessert was amazing! Also I had the lamb wrap with the mango curry sauce. So good! And the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"I am already a fan of Dolce Wraps, and, after my experience with their catering, I am absolutely smitten!  Seriously - If you are hosting ANY kind of event, do yourself a favor and order catering from Dolce Wraps!! You will not be disappointed!!  I was hosting my friend's baby shower for about 45 people at the nearby Bain Park Cabin in Fairview Park. After hosting about one thousand and a half baby and bridal showers in my life, I finally learned my lesson and decided to order the food rather than attempt (and inevitably fail) to recreate all the impossibly tiny and cute canapés from Pinterest.  I'm convinced that Pinterest people don't exist, at least not any who have full time jobs (the only exception being my friend Samantha B.).  That being said, Dolce Wraps to the rescue! I called and talked to Ashley, who was so incredibly helpful and professional. She helped me put together a great menu for the event, and made very helpful suggestions as to both menu items and quantities.   I ordered 40 half wraps, fattoush salad, hummus, baba ghanoush and rice and lentils - it was more than enough food for 45 people PLUS enough leftovers to share with about 15 hungry coworkers the next day. The total was about $210, which was beyond reasonable.  Ashley even delivered the food to the venue, which was a lifesaver, and she was so sweet and wonderful! The presentation of the food in the catering trays was lovely. The rice and lentils is one of my all-time favorite dishes from anywhere in the city.  I am still getting text messages from attendees of the event that say it was by far the best food they've ever had at any party.   I am so pleased with the whole experience, and I will not hesitate to order catering from them again in the future for any party (in addition to the already embarrassingly frequent dinner visits!)"}
{"text":"Love coming here!  The chicken wrap is awesome and satisfying!  I happen to enjoy the blackberry/jasmine tea too!  I get them both every time!"}
{"text":"Did we go to the same place?  What did I miss?  If it's a chipotle style Mediterranean restaurant, and it's not better than Chipotle or a Mediterranean restaurant, why does it exist?  I'm fully welcoming suggestions because I don't see it.  Maybe it was the huge menu.; I didn't know where to start.  I didn't do my Yelp homework.  I looked it over and decided to go with the original rotisserie chicken wrap with tahini.  So I got that in a pita with some rice, a lot of rice.  That's it, homes.  I mean I wish I could go on and on about how it was delicious, and how it was tasty, and how I wanted another one, but I can't.  I also chose a side of tabouli, because that's one of my Mediterranean go-to items.  And that's what I received.  No pita bread to eat it with.  I suppose I could have torn off some of my wrap and ate it, but I would have appreciated a \"hey do you want something with that?\"  So normally this wouldn't be a problem because I can eat tabouli by itself, but this tabouli was plain and lacked a certain amount of lemon and parsley.  In addition to that, the lady working the register was the cold side of unfriendly and I could barely hear her.  Yea, so there's that.  What I do wrong?"}
{"text":"I thought this place was alright. It is good and quick. Good hummus. I wish there were more lamb options. The sign that they use looks a lot like the W and D from Walt Disney, only reversed. That freaked me out. Look at the attached picture. Same font."}
{"text":"Well I spoke too soon... Went in for a carry out a few days ago. Different staff were there. After I was already home when I realized there was no olive oil or sumac seasoning on my Vegetarian Heaven. Honestly, without those crucial additions it was too bland. It's my pet peeve when a restaurant is inconsistent. Food is still good, but they need to work on putting out the same dish in the same way every time."}
{"text":"This place gets better every time.  My husband and I had no clue what to choose on the menu, but we kinda knew what we had a taste for.  We spoke with the staff and they created on the spot what we explained we had a taste for and it was GREAT!!!  We also had one of their smoothies, which was a great addition to our meal!  For get McDonalds....  Dolce Wraps - \"I'm Lovin' It!!!\""}
{"text":"Decided to stop for quick dinner. We were not disappointed. I ordered a chicken wrap with rice, salata, hot sauce, garlic dip, hubby ordered chicken plate with rice and salad. We also ordered lentils and rice for a side, and chips with four different dips. Everything was delicious and the place was very clean. We Weil definitely be back."}
{"text":"Boode provided such amazing service and the food was equally amazing!  What an undiscovered jewel on the Westside."}
{"text":"Service was great very friendly and clean. First time eating there and I would go back. I had the chicken teriyaki stir fry and the lentil rice and it was great. The peanut butter brownie was awesome as well"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this hidden jewel. We started with hummus which was creamy and smooth and better than Aladdin's.   We tried a corned beef wrap which was good as you would find at any Eastside deli.  Also, enjoyed stir fry which was a good size portion.   Atmosphere was comfortable, clean and the service  was friendly.  The prices were very reasonable as is self serve with table service of the main entrees."}
{"text":"I love coming to Dolce Wraps. It's located in the west gate shopping plaza. The food is always fresh. I have never had a bad meal here. There are so many options. Wraps, salad, stir fry, dinner plates, chicken, lamb, shrimp, fattoush, hummus, etc.. any combination. The family that owns Dolce Wraps are so friendly. They treat you like you're their family."}
{"text":"Planned a trip to the mall in Cleveland and decided to look for something different to eat for once, and saw an advertisement for a wraps restaurant beside a pita restaurant, and seeing how Ive never been into pita sandwiches or Mediterranean it was worth a shot.   First things first this place is hard to locate from GPS lol I had to stop and ask some cops that I saw parked in their cars eating, Im sure they didnt mind seeing how they would for sure interrupt anyone's meal to ask questions. So I discovered the place is facing the road and not inside of the plaza parking lot as the GPS had told me.   Once you get inside you'll see its very impressive and decorated beautifully. There are a lot of options here on what you can get in your wrap. I ended up going with the garlic chicken hummus wrap fully loaded with toppings. One of the BEST wraps I can honestly say Ive ever had. Something like this would usually pack around 1,000 calories too and according to the internet it only had 650, so if you're dieting you could split one of these things in half for two seperate meals."}
{"text":"This is goofy.  I'M goofy.  I'm actually updating a review from less than ONE WEEK ago !  I figured...why wait ?    * *  FALAFEL WRAP with HUMMUS and HOT SAUCE  * *   This heavy, gigantic---probably 10\" around---super-food bundle that can easily serve three, is SO good-tasting and healthy that I'm contemplating eating this---exclusively---for one month.   I'll lose some un-needed pounds, my hair will grow another 3 inches, my skin will glow again like a 2-year-olds, I'll cut my grocery costs way down, and with fewer visits there, a tank of gas will easily last twice as long.      A Win-Win for sure.  Look for me---not the big orange poppy face---in Dolce Wraps new commercial.  Yes !  Once they see the before and after shots, they'll stake their business on it.  I'm going to be famous!   Like that SUBWAY guy !   Can't wait.    HeHeHe   *  Order their standard falafel wrap (that comes with mixed greens, salata, and pickled turnip), but ask that they substitute hummus for the tahini, and then the hot sauce.  It's HOT-HOT-HOT.  Better ask for it on the side since a wee bit goes a very long way.                                     ~ ~ ~   This wrap is delicious whether freshly-made, cold, room-temperature, or wrapped in aluminum foil and reheated in a toaster oven @ 200 for 10-20 minutes.     Considering going vegetarian?  START WITH THIS WRAP !!!   I'm serious.    (Don't know if vegan.  Call to confirm.) ."}
{"text":"The way the sign looks and the name sounds, you would think this is an Italian place in Disneyland. However, it most certainly is neither of those things but something better. Really tasty Mediterranean food! We've been here a few times and loved it each time. This last time I got the curry chicken wrap and my hubs got the falafel sandwich. Both were very big portions and very filling. Despite that we also ordered a large hummus to share. I'm pretty picky about my hummus, and this stuff I really like. They also make pita chips there which we ordered to take home with the left-over hummus. As other reviewers have mentioned, the garlic sauce is amazing. The only reason I took off a star is for the selection of iced teas they have, not so great. But, overall, this place has excellent food. I can't wait to go back and try the kanafe."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean fast casual food joint.  They offer stir fry dishes, salads, wraps, hummus, tabbouleh, falafel, baklava, and more! All homemade too.  They offer a variety of different sauces, from a creamy garlic to a spicy sauce and a bunch of others I haven't tried yet. Again, all homemade as well. As Yelper, Cara L mentions, the garlic sauce can linger with you for days and ooze from your pores, so use caution! :P  You can pick from a variety of proteins to have in your wrap, stir fry, or salad: steak, chicken, lamb, or gyro meat  They're made with fresh veggies and soft, fluffy rice.  Great spices and flavors!  The wraps come in this ginormous pita, so it's very filling.  I have yet to try one of their salads, but they look pretty good.  The owner is really nice and cooks up your meal pretty quick!  He's always very appreciative and values his customers.  Just walk up and order from the LCD menu boards, and you'll have your food in a jiffy!  The dining room is clean and modern, with plenty of seating.  There's a few tables outside on the mini patio as well.  They have a soda fountain in the dining room for your beverage needs.  Strangely, each time I've gone to Dolce Wraps, there's been maybe one other customer inside or no one at all.  I hope they stay in business because I like this place.  They have two other locations - Fairview Park and North Royalton."}
