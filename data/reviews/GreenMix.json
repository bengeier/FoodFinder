{"text":"Salads are great and the steak is awesome! But little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Love the BBQ beef!  I've tried most things on his menu and haven't found anything I disliked yet.  The entire family is friendly and helpful.  I love their dressings, though some can be too spicy for my taste.  You can customize anything however you want.  Some people complained about price and portion size, but I don't think either is out of line.  I'd much rather support a local family restaurant than a big chain."}
{"text":"They have fresh salads and really good chicken rice bowls that include an over easy egg.  It is pricy, but you pay for what you get.  Fresh food comes at a price and this is the place to go for a change when eating out."}
{"text":"This is a good lunch place. The other locations are equally good, but it's expensive for what you get. They need to load on the toppings a bit more. Avocado is extra even though they are currently in season. Time to get food was average, I will go back when in the area, but it's not a destination."}
{"text":"Was visiting the area last Thanksgiving and Green Mix was a slice of heaven.  My niece and I had just about every meal there for several days straight.  Loved it.  Coming back in March for a family event and will use them to cater it."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. I have passed by this place several time and finally stopped in. I am so happy I did. I have to say for as great is this place is, I am surprised it isn't more busy. 

I got this chicken, Bacon, avocado panini that was amazing it was called the C square. They use this chibata type bread that is super soft and have this lemon herb aioli that just makes this sandwich it also comes with spinach, cherry tomatoesand blue cheese but I subed that for gouda. It comes with this what seems regular spring salad but it has this Asian dressing that just pushes your plain old spring mix salad to a whole new level. 

I will most definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing salad dressing made the whole salad. Not cheap but healthy, fresh and really worth it. So much better than fast food junk."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I'll admit has a very unique taste but it's wonderful I'm very big on customer service and I had such a great experience keep it up guys."}
{"text":"I've been to this location about 4 times this week.  I love the fresh ingredients and it's very tasty.  I love the Mango shrimp salad.  Very flavorful.  I'm going to attempt to stray from my norm and taste more options."}
{"text":"I didn't expect it to be THAT tasty! I ordered the GreenMix Tuna Panini that comes with a small side salad...wow, it was heaven from the first bite to the last. I'm definitely coming back here with my fianc√© soon. I might even come here once a week for my lunch break."}
{"text":"A great find in Phoenix for fresh, gourmet salads, paninis and rice bowls.  I had the Shrimp salad with chipotle dressing, mangos and avacados and it was delicious.  It's nice to have a healthy option for lunch or dinner without having to sacrifice taste.  I can't wait to go back and try the Chicken Salad and Steak panini"}
{"text":"Fresh Food, Amazing plain n simple. Don't be hesitant or you will miss out. I had the GreenMix Tuna Panini, nothing short of delicious. My better half had the Mexican Tuna Salad, unreal flavors. Must give this place a try, it will be a staple... (10 of 10)
Thank you GreenMix, we'll be back again & again!"}
{"text":"The Mango Shrimp salad was very good!  I've had it several times, so I'll have to explore other items on the menu in the future."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the brown rice bowl and the sesame ginger dressing. The only issue I had was that the website was jot working and they couldn't seem to tell me the amounts in their food such as portions size. Fabulous for the healthy eater on the go."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way home from work looking for something healthy and quick. This really hit the spot. I ordered my husband the Asian BBQ beef salad and it was delicious!  Perfect with the Spicy Ponzu Vinaigrette dressing. I ordered the Greek Chicken salad which was fresh and tasty but nothing extraordinary. I look forward to going back and trying more of the menu items. The place is clean and the staff were kind and helpful."}
{"text":"Following rappelling, it was time for lunch.  We were looking for something light, healthy and filling....  Well, we found it at GreenMix.  Their portion sizes were huge.  The food was fresh, the staff was very friendly and expeditious in getting your food out... This is a great place to grab lunch on the go or stick around and eat in house.."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate at Green Mix and it was yummy fresh food.  The green mix tuna panini was great and the signature dressing was yummy.  Now I just need to get them to open one in San Diego."}
{"text":"Excellent food I come here for lunch all the time.  Please patronize so we can keep good restaurants in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is near my job. It is one of the few restaurants that I can eat at in the area, between my refusal to eat animal products and a gluten intolerance. I have eaten here over a dozen times. I agree with previous reviews that it is overpriced, but I have let that go as it is locally owned and fresh produce can add up. 

HOWEVER, twice a single staff member has spilled on me when cleaning up. The first time she spilled salad dressing on my lap and did not seem to realize it. She gave me a strange look when I asked for another napkin. Once she realized it she did apologize. The second time she spilled someone else's ice on my feet and purse. I got a muttered apology with no eye contact. I waited a few minutes to see if someone would do something to try to keep my business. I am a  regular and it was the second spill. No one approached me so I left. 

I do believe that the young woman is a nice person. She seemed embarrassed, but the staff have poor customer service skills.

Also, I believe that they substitute greens without informing the customer. Once I ordered romaine and believe I got iceberg. Same thing when I ordered butter lettuce. If you want real greens ask for spinach or the mixed greens.

I admire the effort to open a healthy restaurant in South Phoenix. I wish this place was managed better..."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today. Will not be coming back. Rice bowls have no flavor, rice is extremely bland . Chicken is dry. Awkward silence in the restaurant, count at least play soft music. Overall very unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"Not Impressed.

I had the chicken wrap. It was small. The taste was nothing special. I paid $5.99 for it and it came with a small fountain drink. The cup was like 10 ounces. Great. Now I have to get up several times to refill my drink.

Maybe other items are better? There seems to be a great deal of positive reviews so maybe I will try again. Then again, there is never anyone here. Guess I will be going to Subway instead."}
{"text":"I love having a healthy alternative to \"fast food\" in our area.  However, I do agree with some of the other reviews that for the price, the portions seems small and they are indeed stingy with the toppings.   

I went with a friend and I ordered the Chicken Cobb Salad for $8.49.   It's served with a full chicken breast, but I had to search for the bacon, blue cheese, and the slivers (I'm not kidding when I say \"slivers\") of egg.   

They have a wide selection of dressings, which if it's not the busy  the owner will let you try.   The Honey Walnut Vinaigrette is bland, but the Spicy Ponzu Vinaigrette is wonderful (an asian-inpsired sweet sesame), and I enjoyed the Herb Balsamic Vinaigrette (which I subbed on my salad for the Lemon Ranch Herb dressing).

As a side note, but my husband was thrilled to see they served coke in a glass bottle!

I hope the owners read these reviews and try to modify their approach to be a little more generous with their toppings.  

Still, I'm thrilled to have a healthy alternative like Salads to our area in South Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"A good place!  Didn't blow my mind, but wasn't bad.... I had a sandwich with a side salad.  It was all very fresh and very good! Very healthy.  I would definitely come back here again, although I felt like it was slightly over priced."}
{"text":"Wow!  I can't choose between scrumptious and super yummy. The food is prepared fresh each day so itts always flavorful and attractive. The dressings are prepared on premesise and a complement to the salad or wrap or rice dish. The menu of panini, wraps, rice dishes salads provide enough variety to eat there regularly(yes.. We do!) and not get bored. Prices are reasonable and service is friendly and helpful. Highly recommend it if you are in the neighborhood of 24th street/Baseline. P.s. love The Farm panini."}
{"text":"Excellent place for healthy food! We always get the Asian BBQ beef salad with the brown rice (I hate brown rice but theirs is to die for! So tender and moist). The beef is  always delicious and their vinaigrettes are nice and tangy especially the orange."}
{"text":"Today was my second time here and this place is great. I have only had a salad and everything is so fresh. It is a little pricey but with everything so fresh and home made it is well worth it. Very healthy choices. Great spot for lunch if you are in the south mountain area."}
{"text":"Salad snob here. I supposed it's a healthy place to eat, but it's not something I would go back to again and again. I had a Greek salad, which was okay at best. The yogurt dressing wasn't particularly flavorful, nor was the rub used on the meat. If I were on a strict diet, this place could be the one that sends me off the diet due to bad tastes.

If the dressing were better and the spices on the chicken were more apt, I think it would have been a better meal."}
{"text":"Great find!  Was in the area visitng friends and stopped by Greenmix.  Had a BLTC (love the lemon herb aioli), and of course ate some of my friend's seared tuna salad.  So many cool looking cool things on the menu, wish I could try more."}
{"text":"I ate a huge lunch so i decided to get a salad for dinner.  I thought it was a good decision but it wasen't. I'll tell ya why.

I entered around dinner time and the place was empty.  I was the only customer the entire time.  That was a bit strange but from now on, I'll trust the rule of, if your the only one there is a reason for it and leave.

So, I walked in, and held the menu for 4 minutes real time.  The guy at the counter simply looked at me silently.  Can I say \"AWKWARD!\"  I had no idea if it was an Asian inspired or Mediterranean type of menu.  How the heck does this place work?  I wanted a fatoosh salad but no luck so I played it safe and got a Greek salad with chicken.  I wish it would have come with some kind of bread to break up the salad texture.

To make a long story short:

Cons:

The food was a bit plain.  I could make it for $4 from frys but who wants to cook?  Not me.  It cost almost $10 for the salad alone, to go. 

Small portions.

No help or customer service from the guy at the counter.  I think he wanted to continue watching his laptop.  I have to say he was polite while I ordered a basic salad with a dumb look on my face.  Hey it was a long work day.

Pros:

The woman who was cleaning and cooking was very polite and had a spark of personality.  Too bad she appeared to be doing all the work.

The store was amazingly clean, including the kitchen.  The reason for the two stars instead of one.  I love to see clean restaurants."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Everyone was friendly and accommodating. Mom had the blue cow pannini and she's still raving about it. Sister had mango shrimp salad and I had seared citrus tuna salad. Delish! Fresh ingredients, nice dressings, and healthy portions for under 10 bucks. Thank you Green Mix!"}
{"text":"I love this location. The Young lady that helped me there is always incredibly intrinsic involving my choices with the menu. Her suggestions are incredible and every time I get a wrap, or a salad it's perfect. The customer service employees there is astronomical. There always willing to help out, make suggestions, and correct things that are wrong, or even assist when I might pick something that I don't not enjoy as much as I thought I would. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ok, I've only had one of these salads so far (Thai Shrimp) but it's ridiculously delicious!  I highly suggest this place if you want a decently sized, fresh salad.  So much better than the same ole ranch or cesar salad!"}
{"text":"Came in to order three dinners & some veggies & flat bread ... Probably about a 60.00 order & the woman at counter ignores me, asks the man behind me what he wants because she knows him. Awesome first impression... I just left. 

South Phoenix location has such better manners, I live in Foothills but won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I was out and hungry yet wanted to grab something more healthy than a diabetes double with cheese and low and behold I came across Green Mix in Phoenix they claim to offer modern salads, (whatever that means) and paninis. The cashier was a character and the Thai shrimp salad was something...beets red and green peppers shrimp hard boiled egg walnuts in more all up in your mouth....each bite was interesting enough that I will go back and try another salad or the green chicken panini"}
{"text":"Finally a place to eat something other than fried grease or cardboard pizza in SoMo. 
Everything at Green Mix is exceptionally fresh. I ordered the Walnut Chicken Salad and the Asian Chicken Salad. Everything was fresh and hand-cut right there (yes, they wear gloves!). The greens, the chicken, the apples, the walnuts, the chickpeas, ...everything was fresh, not a tinge of brown or sogginess on anything. 
Dressing on both salads was fairly light and not overpowering, which is great if you want to avoid the \"drowned in 1000 Islands\" thing. 

It's pricey if you think of it as \"just salad\" but the fact that it's made fresh makes it worth it. You can also make up your own salad creation, add or omit ingredients, and so forth. 
The owner is a hoot."}
{"text":"We had the shrimp mango salad and blue cow with the sauce on the side! Soo yummy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was unaware it was possible to ruin a salad so much! SO GROSS! Three of us girls in the office went to lunch here, 2 left sick & I was just left with the bad taste in my mouth. Do Not Recommend! & That makes me sad, because I'm a salad girl :/ I wanted so badly to like this place. Expensive too"}
{"text":"Food is great, very fresh and great flavor, wow. Good specials too. The ordering process with filling out the order form is a little odd, but overall this place is great."}
{"text":"Terrific fresh salads and excellent grilled chicken and shrimp.  My wife and I really enjoy their food.  It's a welcome addition to an otherwise sparse selection of good non-chain restaurants in South Phoenix."}
{"text":"Very good very tasty great variety.  Place is nice and clean. Staff was nice. My husband and I had a lunch date here today. We love the healthy choices. It was little after noon so it wasn't busy at all. I like that you are served on glass plates and real silverware. I had the Honey Walnut Chicken Salad the chicken was prepared just right. My husband had the Fiesta Shrimp Pasta which he said was very good. Everything was fresh and came out very quickly. We will be returning to eat and to share it with friends."}
{"text":"This place is brand new in Ahwatukee and I figured I would give it a shot. I ordered the Korean Pork BBQ wrap, which came with a small side salad with a vinaigrette. The wrap was not very tasty (bland) and was kind of small, considering it was $9. There was only 1 very small piece of BBQ pork in the wrap, which was very disappointing. The salad and vinaigrette were just ok. I was expecting a lot more. Too bad."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the others options but DO NOT order the steak salad. Steak was almost ALL fatty and was really undercooked. Salad dressing was good though. Just ate the salad and tossed out the meat."}
{"text":"I keep coming back for the brown rice bowl with steak and Spicy Ponzu sauce ... seriously good."}
{"text":"Love this place... been here a couple of times. Great place for salads
I had their Caesar Salad and Mango Shrimp Salad. Loved them both"}
{"text":"Finally a fresh lunch option in the desert :)  I enjoy visiting/working in Phoenix, but always find it difficult to locate a place with nice salads, and this place fills the tummy.

I enjoyed the fresh salad and wrap options.  They have several signature options, or you can build your own.  I went for the summer veggie salad with grilled veggies, and it was amazingly flavorful.  I also had a cup of the soup of the day (spicy chicken) and it was quite tasty and zesty.  

The workers are friendly and super efficient, as the line moves quite quickly during lunch hour."}
{"text":"This is our go-to healthy spot! The food is always fresh and delicious, and the service is always super friendly. Can be a little pricey but it's definitely worth it. It can be more of a lunch place, so on nights and weekends there's not much of a wait."}
{"text":"This is probably my fourth time here. Wanted to try something different. And that is exactly what it is! It's melt in the mouth delicious, healthy and extremely affordable. Try this place, it's truly amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place! The atmosphere is great, the food is out of this world fresh and wonderful. Had the Asian Chicken Salad and was blown away by the presentation and the price. If you want a gourmet meal that looks good, tastes good, at a great price I highly recommend GreenMix. John the owner like Jay V. said really makes everyone feel very welcome, and one of the sweetest person's you will ever encounter. 

Keep up the great job!!"}
{"text":"$12 Cobb salad was \"weak.\" It had 1/2 a slice of avocado, corn, and a sprinkle of blue cheese. Won't be going back. For that price I can go to a different place."}
{"text":"I got the farm wrap and it was delicious! I really enjoy the lemon herb ranch w/the grilled veggies."}
{"text":"My partner and I live in the neighborhood and shop at Fry's several times a week.  This place has been open a 2-3 years and today was our 3rd visit.  We won't be going back.  We are both vegetarian, I ordered the veggie panini, which isn't a panini, and he ordered a 'make your own salad'.  Add two drinks and it was $20.  Just an in our last two experiences, the portions were really small.  The salad was really a side salad spread out on a big plate.  My sandwich was pretty bland, but at least I didn't walk out of the place hungry...that came 30 minutes later.  My partner left hungry.  I love the idea of this place, and I really want to support a local family business, but you can't charge $20 for lunch and have people walk out hungry."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it NO stars. My boyfriend and I came here for 2 reasons. 1st: He has a gluten allergy and we knew we would be safe with a salad. 2nd: There was a big sign that read: $3.99 (& up) Specials Includes Fountain Drink. So, we figured it would be a cheap lunch. We were soooooo wrong. Upon ordering, I asked what the $3.99 special was, the lady said a chicken salad sandwich. Ok, great! And it includes a fountain drink (according to the advertisment)...WRONG. Fountain drinks are another $1.95. So there is no such thing as a $3.99 special that includes a fountain drink, FALSE ADVERTISING!!! I ordered the sandwich and drink and my bf ordered a build your own salad, which had lettuce, cucumber, and onions, nothing else and no dressing and a fountain drink. Total was $15.48!!!! We are assuming we will get a fair amount of food. WRONG AGAIN. My sandwich was mostly bread and didn't have any kind of side, not even a sprig of parsley for presentation, and his salad was a handful of lettuce with 4-5 slices of cucumbers and some dry onions, probably smaller than a side salad from Wendy's. Irritated already, i took 2 bites of a crappy chicken salad sandwich and low and behold a curly black hair in the middle of the chicken salad. The lady behind the counter had kinky black hair so I knew exactly where it came from, thank God! I took the sandwich back to her and she offered to make another, I told her I just wanted my money back, she gave me back the $4. So all in all we paid $11 and some change for a ridiculous excuse for a salad and 2 sodas. And still left hungry. 
I will NEVER go back here, I cringe just thinking about it. And I am pretty easy on restaurants, being that I was a server for 8 years, but this place is aweful. 

STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day after hiking on South Mountain.  It feels like a slightly nicer Subway restaurant when you walk in, the place is very brightly decorated and cheery.  THe reason I am writing this review is for the Farm hot pressed panini.  FIrst off it's not technically a panini more like hot toasted sandwich.  I had never had a squash sandwich before, but it was really good.  The break was toasty and fresh and the vegetables were cooked perfectly.  If you are near this place for lunch stop in and have one.  The price is a bit on the high side for a sandwich shop, but it was really good.

Try:

- The Farm Sandwich"}
{"text":"First of all I was excited that there was a fresh salad place in Ahwatukee in a sea of fast food places.   I was disappointed....
1. The menu on the wall did not list the prices so I had to ask for a paper copy
2. 6.99$ for a salad bar which I did not feel was that bad until she told me that I get one green and 5 toppings with that and a protein is extra really?
3. When she started to make my salad I asked for carrots the shredded kind she (I am not kidding) puts three small pieces on the salad, I asked could I have a few more and she puts two more on, are you kidding. 
4. Of all of the 5 toppings you could have put it all in the small part of your palm that is completely a  rip off.  I paid 7.49$ for a container of lettuce. 
5. I am assuming that this is a franchise and the Asian owners of this place should have done their research before buying this place.  You can get a great salad with tons of toppings at several places around the area this is a horrible option for the price. Sweet Tomatoes down the street has around the same price for a take out and you get much more for the price.   
6. I should have complained and talked to the Manager but I didn't and partly because I have dealt with Asian owners before and it usually does not go very well. 

All in all they will not be in business long charging those prices for lettuce.  I noticed that other reviews said that there were some good things on the menu but I am not sure I will go back."}
{"text":"I really like this little place.  The employees are friendly, the food comes quickly and it's delicious.  The orange sesame salad dressing is sooo yummy.  I've been a few times for lunch and every time has been excellent.  They also have a frequent customer punch card so you can get some deals with that if you like coming here.

The real dishes and cutlery are a nice touch too.  My favorite sandwich is the BLTC - a BLT with smoked gouda.  I'm salivating just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Food was good! Proportions are small for a restaurant in the USA but they filled you up! The re were only two people working, I think it was the owners, so we waited about 10 min for our food but you can see them preparing the food from scratch. That to me, I would pay a little bit more money for fresh prepared food.   The place was clean! The kitchen was clean! Very friendly! I would definitely  go back again!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Healthy, delicious, no salt used, taste buds satisfied.. No joke! I thought healthy eating isn't as good as pigging out but this place.. You gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Awful. Waited around 30 minutes to never get my meal. A simple chicken sandwich. They gave me shit when I asked for a refund and when they finally gave it to me, it wasn't a full refund. Didn't even compensate me for the terrible Sprite I ordered. Zero stars would be an apt review. Don't eat here. It's a poorly run business that needs a serious makeover and customer service training."}
{"text":"Super delicious! I don't mind the wait at all for the food because you know it's being cooked fresh! It's a small \" mom and pop\" type so they run the show for the most part so expect a little wait for the food but it's worth the extra time! Add an egg to the brown rice!"}
{"text":"Always delicious!! I wish more people came here to give them more business as well as their location in Ahwatukee. 

Only thing they need to work on is staffing. Everyone is so nice but they need more help. Sometimes the ones taking the orders cook as well making people who walk in wait and I saw people walk out after waiting so long.


Foods delicious!!!
The lunch special with the beef is outstanding and the green chicken panini is a must."}
{"text":"Can somebody say Green Chicken Panini?!!!

If you are looking for s different mix of food from your usual fast food, Green Mix is definitely a place you might want to check out & try!

I love healthy food to begin with, but this place takes a tastier spin on your usual sandwichwes, salads and wraps!  Did I tell you about their salad?  The dressing is to die for!

Only drawback is that it does take a while to receive your food.  I suggest calling beforehand.  It does get crowded during lunch time and when it is not, they are short staffed.

They give Military discounts and incentives w/a punch card.  Definitely not bad for those looking for a different & healthier alternative.  :)"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Mango Shrimp!! Soo good! The only downside here is no wifi! I wanted to eat and get some homework done on my laptop."}
{"text":"First time here and I am not impressed. I came in hungry and left sick to my stomach. After watching the lady make my chicken Cobb salad, it was absolutely gross. She used gloves (thank God) but after throwing some leaves together she just left it out in the open while flies flew around. As she went around touching trash, dirty utensils, etc she kept the same gloves on and kept wiping with what I'm assuming old dirty towels left on the counter to use for the counter, not wiping your hands. Seriously, y'all if food poisoning or the stomach flu is what you want, by all means check this place out. Not to mention... $13 for a salad? Especially in such an unsanitary place, not worth it!"}
{"text":"Delicious. We first stopped here and I was terrified as i hate salad places usually. I've tried all of their paninis now and love them. The one with gouda cheese is a little heavy on the gouda, which I never thought I would hear myself say. The ginger dressing they add to their side salad is delicious. I go and have to make myself try something besides the Seared Tuna."}
{"text":"Update: ok GreenMix you won your 5th star today!

Very classily done too.

Today I had a new guy join me for lunch, beforehand the conversation went like this.

\"Where are you taking us to lunch?\"

\"Salad place\"

\"Huh, guess I'll join\"

This new guy, let's just say he doesn't seem to enjoy many salads in his meal times. 

I came in with my party, ordered and was promptly delivered an array of awesome custom salads. 

Everyone was thoroughly impressed with the selection and fresh taste of the salads. 

Our server happen to mention that they have refinished their tables and pointed out to me that they weren't sticky, he was very proud,  and he should be.  Tables are great and no longer have a sticky touch to them.  He didn't mention seeing the review but that was the only thing I could really give a \"con\" remark to on my original Yelp review at GreenMix.  

Outstanding! Here is a business that pays attention to their reviews and makes the necessary changes for their customers.  Thank you... see you soon."}
{"text":"I used to live over in South Mountain and order food from here all the time. I'm addicted to their Fiesta Shrimp Panini. I've tried most of their dishes from salads to rice bowls and everything's delicious and fresh. 

Now that I live in Ahwatukee, I can continue to get my fix. Love this place and love supporting \"mom and pop\" shops. Excellent customer service and all priced fairly.

Here's a tip if \"you don't want to wait\" for your food- Call it in and pick it up."}
{"text":"I love everything about Green Mix - from the food, the clean restaurant, to the super friendly owners. I've lived in the area for a couple of years and probably eat here at least once a month. I'm way overdue for a review. This is probably the best place to eat. Everything else is a bunch of nasty fast food chain spots. 

My fave is the Fiesta Shrimp Panini, which was recommended by one of the owners when I first ate here. I'm totally hooked. The combo of grilled shrimp, romaine, tomato, jalape√±o, cilantro and their creamy chipotle dressing is phenomenal."}
{"text":"All I can say is go and order the Korean Beef salad, OMG.... Soooooo good! Even my daughter's grilled chicken panini was on point, she ate all her chicken and feel asleep!! ;) Food is freshly prepared, even the salad dressing!! YUMMO!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken plate. It was delicious, I will come back again for sure. Fresh ingredients and good call ahead service. Order was correct and had decent portions."}
{"text":"For $13 I expected a delicious steak salad. This is nothing but fat. The worst salad I've ever had. I threw it away."}
{"text":"This place is a true oasis in the middle of shopping bleakness. And it's got a nice outdoor patio as well, along the little walking path between the monstrous box stores. Stop in and take a break be glad you did. The price is a bit more than you might pay for much lower quality food -- deal with it. They have excellent healthy ingredients. Plus it is a very nicely laid out and designed restaurant, a comfortable place to relax. Plus you can get free wifi from the box store nearby, what more do you want in a daily restaurant. 

The specials are great. That's all I get, because I have trouble deciding on anything else. But go for it -- I think the specials are a GREAT deal because you get to start out with the best healthiest tastiest somewhat spicy chicken-and-cabbage soup in the land."}
{"text":"The food is good. The reason why I'm rating 3 stars is because it's too over priced. I paid over $10 for a salad that just did not satisfy my hunger."}
{"text":"If you want a quick and enjoyable salad this may be the place. The only reason i gave 3 stars is because my sister said her chicken was \"spongy\" mine, on the otherhand was fine. She picked out all the chicken then finished her salad. The prices here are appropriate for the portion."}
{"text":"The meats are hot and tender and the greens are fresh and good quality. I always feel good mentally about what I ate and feel good physically after. It's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for and their Daily Special is an affordable option without sacrificing size. The Korean beef is tasty and their salads offer flavorful and appealing options.  

The environment is clean and kept up and the staff is helpful and attentive. 

Tip: Check out the wall before you order for pictures of different items."}
{"text":"Gotta say this place is pretty good. I tried the Mango Shrimp Salad and a drink for about $15, so it's a little expensive. However, the salad was delicious, and the dressing was slightly sweet, slightly spicy, and very good.

My only complaint is that the order counter is cluttered, almost made me leave. At the counter you can see the kitchen and it doesn't look 'dirty' but it looks very cluttered which I tend to think is dirty. Maybe if the counters were less cluttered, and the view to the kitchen was covered I would have hd a better first impression."}
{"text":"At last! A healthy option among the sea of chain fast-food places in South Phoenix. 

The Green Chicken panini is so freaking good! Amazing flavors. I really love  the brown rice bowls that come with an egg. 

Fresh, delicious and healthy!"}
{"text":"I went here lunch and it was good but nothing special. 

PROS:
I liked that you can build your own salad or wrap. That is what drew me to this place. I am vegan & hate places that only offer one standard veggie option. 

I liked that they had a variety of greens, nuts, fruits, etc.

The spinach wrap itself was delicious & fresh!

CONS:
The price listed on the build your own wrap is kind of a scam- all proteins are extra.

No tofu, bean or other good vegan protein option.

The huge paper menus that you mark your choices on seem like a waste of paper. That's a lot of garbage being generated. Plus the food for dine in is served on paper plates. More garbage created.

OVERALL: 
The wrap was good, not great & a little pricey. I would not seek out this place but if was in the area & needed lunch i might go back."}
{"text":"Half an almond

I haven't found any convenient salad joins in the Phoenix area so I was interested in trying this one out. Ordered the grilled marinated chicken salad ($9.75)to go. Noticed when I got home that the toppings were completely lacking. The croutons and nuts were nonexistent. I seriously found half an almond and no croutons!! I mean I went digging for those almonds and nada. I ordered feta cheese and they decided I'd rather have a sliver of parmesan instead. The container was all spinach with four strips of chicken. For God's sake people the toppings especially the cheese and nuts are the best part of any salad. Now because of my stupid, healthy decision to try this place I'm left still starving with a measly $10 box of spinach."}
{"text":"Went here seeking a tasty salad and I got what I wanted.

The guy working there was super nice. I was saying I wanted the Asian Chicken salad because the idea of Panko bread crumbs sounded really good, but I also didn't want a salad with meat on it. He had me get the Happy Veggie and added Panko to that. Then when he brought it out he brought me both the dressing for the Happy Veggie and the Asian Chicken. So nice!

My Happy Veggie was super tasty. They put seasonal veggies on there and they were great. I loved both dressings but the Asian Chicken salad one was my favorite.

My husband tried a flatbread that involved a fried egg. He was a fan.

I love a restaurant with tasty food and nice people working."}
{"text":"I had the daily special with Grilled Tuna. It comes with Rice, Salad and a soup. Really good.  Staff was very nice.  A couple of regulars were coming in, and by their reactions there must be other things on the menu that are great.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here to enjoy a healthy lunch which left me with no appetite after the cash register attendant made an error and double charged my friend. After pulling up a bank statement to provide proof of double charge they proceeded to tell my friend she needed to pay and no transaction went through. As the meal was being served they took it back and told my friend to call the bank and provide proof that the statement visible on her phone wasn't enough validation. After calling and clarifying, yes the order was charged twice and hen my money was refunded; however The workers continued to argue about it as we sat and tried to eat the lunch. For the cost of the meal, and taste I wasn't too happy."}
{"text":"I popped in here because I was in the shopping center.  I ordered the cobb salad, one of their design.  It's quite likely the worst, most bland salad I've ever had.  I can't remember what was supposed to be on it, but there's chicken, corn cherry tomatoes, soggy cheese, a little avocado  and a bunch of caesar type lettuce.  The chicken was fine, but the rest of the salad was completely unmemorable.  I ate the whole thing because I was starving and i'm still hungry.

I wouldn't normally care, I'd just never go back, but this was a pretty expensive salad for a to-go place, almost $13.  I saw some wraps going out & they looked huge, so maybe those are better.  Don't go for the salad."}
{"text":"Found this while looking for a quick, healthy, and reasonably priced place to grab dinner. That's exactly what I found, the price is decent and the food was definitely geared to toward the healthy side, and there isn't much of that around that area. Salads were fresh with plenty of options to choose from. Will certainly be going back there when I'm back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh salad for the price. You can make your own or have one of their creations. Same with the sandwiches. Great service too. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time coming here only this time I did the take out as opposed to sitting down and enjoying the salad. Not too bad. I think they give you a little bit more when you eat in and they might actually cut the chicken up for you in smaller pieces. Still not a bad place to go,  I might go back who knows, dont get me wrong the salad is good, I was just a little disappointed in the size for the price for take out."}
{"text":"Food is usually good.   Consistency is a big issue.   They don't seem to like to run the AC so it's hot as hell.  Would like to see them do well because the concept is great."}
{"text":"Had a chicken sandwich - it was nothing short of wonderful.  I wasn't expecting very much and I was blown away. A sandwich and a side salad included for $5.99, a good deal. All the flavors went together and I couldn't stop eating it! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the teriyaki chicken. It was mostly chicken fat.  Awful.  I did not finish it and I will not return."}
{"text":"I like! Owners have a great personality. If you're really hungry probably not the best spot. It's a little pricy for the amount of food but the food you do receive is GREAT."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  When I looked at the menu I was excited to get my food.  I was a bit disappointed.  It was something I could have easily thrown together at home with the same ingredients."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp salad and absolutely loved it. We came in at closing and we were still able to order. They were quick and the food was great. I definitely will be coming back for a healthy meal."}
{"text":"Hidden gem warning for south Phoenicians! Healthy and great tasting food.
 I took my mother out for lunch here on Christmas eve and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. They currently have a small but expanding menu, but if what they have is a tell of what is to come, the signs look quite delicious. I had The Pescado , which is their seared albacore panini and it had some whooping flavour for only $7.99. My mother had the chicken rice bowl, which I must say for $5.99 had some amazing value for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place did not live up to expectations.  Stopped in the other night in the hopes of getting a healthy dinner quickly.  Even though we were the only people in the place it took more than 20 mins to get our 2 dishes.  When they arrived, the meat on both was very dry and overcooked and everything was way over dressed (this may be the first time I have ever said this).  Additionally, the plate my husband ordered was so salty that he abandoned much of it (also a first)."}
{"text":"My family and I went for a hike at South Mountain and decided to go in for a healthy dinner. When we walked in the place was completely empty, with the exception of a sole worker. We walked in and ordered, and things were overpriced. We waited for our food, and suddenly we heard the sound of a microwave. The tables were not clean, the place did not seem super sanitary. Then approximately three different customers walked in and they all received their food before we did!! We waited at least half an hour to receive salads. The salad was less than stellar, and is definitely not worth the price, or the wait. It was nothing special, and I am sure that anyone could make a better salad. 

TLDR: Service is not great. Food is okay. Place is not clean."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. It is awesome! The owners and staff are friendly and the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Definitely not a place I would drive over 10 minutes to eat at, but with ingredients like seared albacore tuna*, grilled ribeye steak*, smoked gouda cheese*, and lemon herb aioli, this little salad & sandwich shop is a great choice for when you are in the area. And even though the atmosphere isn't as gourmet as it's menu it's ok, because neither is the price. I'll go back.
*Item listed just to give a sampling of options. I didn't actually eat this, so if it's gross and you hate it, sorry."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to GreenMix. It was just as good as the first visit. Last time I got the build your own panini with the grilled herb marinated chicken. It was fantastic! This time I had the build your own salad with the grilled jumbo shrimp. It was just as yummy. Everything was fresh and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. So far I really like this place and I hope it continues to do well. It's a nice alternative to some of the fast food in the area."}
{"text":"GreenMix is by far my favorite place to go to for any kinds of salads and their panini's are amazing!

You're able to customize your salad to whatever you want and their dressings for the salads are awesome. I've tried their wraps with a chipotle sauce and it's delicious. They include the perfect combination of toppings like corn, pico de gallo, black beans, and cucumbers. I recently tried their grilled chicken panini and that was WOW! They put fresh grilled chicken with gouda cheese, sliced apples and avocado...nice crisp taste. 

Other than their amazing food, their service is always up to par!"}
{"text":"This Place was recommended by a coworker and close to my job 
I ordered a mango shrimp salad and it was amazing! The shrimp were huge and the salad dressing was Delicious I could drink it 
My order was ready quick place is cute and easy"}
{"text":"I used to love this place for a healthy lunch options. Unfortunately, it appears things have changed since I was last there. The Chicken Honey Walnut salad used to be great, with fresh grilled chicken on top. The mess that was served to me today could hardly be called grilled chicken. Slimey, fake strips of rubbery chicken. Yuck. What a waste of $11.00. I actually just threw it away because it's not worth the risk."}
{"text":"Love this very special restaurant. The spicy vegetable and chicken soup is extraordinary. Both the salads and sandwiches are excellent. Don't miss trying my favorite ginger house dressing. The owner is very friendly and the food is delicious. A regular favorite of our family who is tired of the same unhealthy options elsewhere."}
{"text":"Everything was fairly yummy.  I wonder if it's a LITTLE bit overpriced though.   I paid $43 for a salad, a rice bowl, and 3 paninis. The Paninis are kinda on the small side, but the flavors really POP and the food is definitely fresh. 

The paninis were better on the morning after, having the leftovers.  Heated it in the micro for 30 seconds and it really brought all the flavors out better than eating the other half on the first day did.

I'd skip the rice bowls though.  Nothing wowed us about that dish.  

Lucky for me they are in my neighborhood, so I'll give them another visit soon."}
{"text":"The woman at the counter was eager to help a first-timer understand the menu and how to order, despite her thick Asian accent. I had the \"Daily Special\" Chicken Salad Panini (pictured), but was unimpressed.  The bread wasn't at all panini-like and probably shouldn't have been warmed for a traditionally cold salad. I may try this place again but if I do, I'll stick to some other salad --- sans the warm bun."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food! I've had the chicken and brown rice bowl and the chicken Cobb salad, both of which were fantastic."}
{"text":"I was introduced to green mix by a co-worker and love this place! My co-workers had a bridal shower lunch for me and they loved the place.     Now that we moved back to the area, I am excited to be near Green Mix again. I usually get the green apple chicken panini and my husband gets the jumbo shrimp panini-a must try!"}
{"text":"Pretty Good

We were looking for a spot for a light lunch and Green Mix fit the bill. My sister and I both enjoyed our salads. The ingredients are fresh, plentiful, and the selection is large enough for everyone to find something they would enjoy. Green Mix also serves panini and rice bowls.  I will have to give those a try on my next visit.

The staff are  friendly and engaging. The restaurant is clean and inviting. If you ever find yourself in the mood for a deliciously light lunch you have to try this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I knew it was going to be a good place when i discovered that they had the softest toilet paper of any restaurant I've ever frequented. I had the shrimp and mango salad. The shrimp was fresh and cooked perfectly. The salad ingredients were also very fresh although not particularly innovative. The dressing was really flavorful (I had the greenmix dressing). The only issue I have is the price. 12.00 for a salad seems steep. But if I paid extra for the Charmin and the clean environment, it was worth the extra couple bucks."}
{"text":"Website is awful. 
No menu online.
Ordered Hawaiian Beef got Beef & Broccoli.
Food is solid C.
Lone employee (assuming owner) not too friendly.
Too many good places around to give this a second try."}
{"text":"Love this place. I could eat here everyday. Congratulations on opening the new location but I miss John!!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here a few weeks ago and Yelp reminded me to review this place. Food was really tasty. I had the Korean BBQ salad. The price was absurd for a salad. It was like $12 with a drink... I think. I was hungry like two hours later. Good food, high price, slow service is how I would review this place."}
{"text":"The Valley could use more fresh in and out options like this! While in Downtown Phoenix for a meeting this weekend, lunch hour hit and I needed a healthy meal on the run. Enter GreenMix! As I walked in, I experience a bit of menu anxiety since it was my first visit and I wasn't sure what to expect. However, the staff was friendly and once they learned I was a first timer, the guy walked me through the steps. I decided to go with a salad, so I first choice the type of greens, followed by four additions from the bowls filled with veggies and cheese. This salad would be $5.99. They also had other bowls full of avocado, eggs, etc. However, those were 75 cents extra per topping. I'm a sucker for avocado so I decided it was work the three quarters. I also ended up adding chicken which was another $2. I ended up walking away with a hefty salad and soda for under $10. It's not cheap, but worth it for a fresh salad topped with added items! I will definitely visit again and keep my finger's crossed that they will open up more locations in the Valley."}
{"text":"Best lunch in South Phoenix! Love the Korean BBQ on rice, with Spicy Ponzu. Also the Chicken Cobb Salad on the Pita is amazing! You can tell the Owner-Manager cares about what he makes and wants you to be happy!"}
{"text":"By far the most tender and juicy Korean BBQ beef I've ever had. I said I was hungry so she recommended the panini. Very good decision. So freaking delicious."}
{"text":"Store had zero atmosphere no music loud fan-Super awkward. Expensive my boyfriend and I both got a salad and a drink-cost over $30. Also watched the employees chat over our food as we worked our way into about 20 minutes of waiting. Finally got our food and our silverware that was wrapped in napkins was dirty."}
{"text":"I like this place, definitely something different. especially when all that's around is fast food joints. Everything thing ive had here has been great tasting and fresh. The menus are a little confusing, they are a sheet you fill out. Tho i think it would be more convenient to have you know, a regular menu. its very quiet and never that busy during lunch. Its a little more out of the pocket than the normal lunch but for what you get, i think its worth it."}
{"text":"Salads are delicious there jumbo shrimps go perfect on top! There unique dressings to choose from Lime infused ranch was amazing! 

Cons- Poor customer Service, not helpful when it comes to being undecided or asking for their recommendations"}
{"text":"I really could not believe the quality of food for the price. I had the steak panini with gouda cheese instead of the bleu. The chipotle sauce is fantastic and the panini bread is just right, not too thick and toasted just enough to still be soft. I signed up for Yelp just to review this place. We will definitely be frequenting this place!"}
{"text":"Ok.  This is one of those restaurants that is off of the beaten path but is soooo totally worth it!  It is in a strip mall at Baseline and 24th St in the Fry's shopping center.  When you walk in, the restaurant has a very comfortable feel.  Reviewing the menu, the entire menu reveals food that is incredibly heathy not to mention tasty.  This family owned restaurant makes you feel welcome as soon as you walk it.  I don't know about the majority of people around town, but I, for one, love to support local business in lieu of corporate chains.  What can I tell you, beside being very comfortable and friendly, the food is INCREDIBLE!!!  I had the Thai Shrimp salad which was an incredible experience of flavor.  Would I return here to eat again???  You bet I would!  In a heart beat!  Thank you for an incredible first experience!  :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Nutritious! 

The staff was super nice and friendly the food was sooooo good! The food was fresh ! I will definitely keep coming back! 

The speed was great for lunch, I was in and out in less than 10 min. Definitely come here if you have a chance"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst ordering system in the history of earth.  The written out pencil and paper menu system is pointless and wastes time.  The food is just okay, about what you'd expect out of strip mall fare.  Staff was a family and they were all rude if you asked for any deviation or change from their menu items (No onions got a scowl).  Way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time tonight and I absolutely love it!! One of the best salads I've ever had!!! I ordered the chicken Cobb salad on flatbread."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my boss here... cafeteria style, salads... not bad but not awesome salads... but they sure are proud of them 2 salads and drinks came to over $30! So, would I go there again? Maybe, but I haven't. I'm not intending on putting it in my normal rotation."}
{"text":"I had a very different experience than previous reviewers. The restaurant was comfortable, the staff friendly, and the food tasty. Currently on special at 6.99, I had a custom salad with the Korean BBQ Beef. The meat was tender and tasty, and seemed a reasonable amount for a salad. All ingredients were fresh and good. I will definitely be back to try something different."}
{"text":"Came here with my Boyfriend Wanting to eat something healthy and was not disappointed! Had a yummy FRESH Steak Salad! And he had a Honey Walnut Chicken salad ! Great service!!! Will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Love the variety and freshness of the ingredients! Very good for those dieting because its all healthy foods. You cannot get these types of wraps anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and will never return. I ordered the chicken walnut salad. It was bland and the dressing extremely watery. When I complained, the manager said I was wrong, it was a good salad, and I didn't know what fresh food tastes like. She then took my plate and didn't offer a replacement. I just wasted $10 and didn't get to eat. 

While the food is sub-par, the management is what prompted this review."}
{"text":"Finally a new restuarant in South Phoenix..I went the other night not knowing what to expect and was very happy when I saw the inside.. the food selection was awesome..and the salad I had with the creamy horseradish dressing was wonderful.. Just enough bite to it but no over powering..  The owner John was my favorite waiter at Pan Asia and I'm glad he opened up a new place here in South Phoenix... Kudos to John and his staff.

Gary"}
{"text":"Food is good; however, they skimp so much on ingredients, you feel like you're getting totally ripped off. The nickel and dime you for everything....not worth the price and won't be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  Bad food! 
Ordered a Shrimp Caesar Salad...shrimp was bad. Paid 12.99 for the salad. I took it back to the manager and ordered a build your own with no meat and she would not refund me the difference of 6.00.  So expensive and not good food! Don't waste your money! 

I will never return and I will let everyone know how terrible the food and service is."}
{"text":"Just in town visiting and wanted a healthy option. Man I wish they had this where I live. Incredibly healthy, fresh and affordable. Many options for even picky eaters."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, nutritious, and priced right. The lunch special came with a tasty chicken soup, definitely not from a mix. I then had the salmon with rice and a salad. The salmon was very flavorful and came with a light sauce over the top. Not much atmosphere. Clean. Most customers were for take-out. I'll be back for the food!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, and excellent food. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of chicken that was on my salad. Also the lemon slices for the tea were large. This may seem trivial but I abhor the trend of restaurants cutting the lemons into 300 small pieces to save on food costs."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. They don't use gloves, don't pay attention to good service and cleanliness. They would actually rather argue with you then try to improve something or apologize. They have really gone down hill. Do yourself and family a favor and stay away. Not worth the risk of getting sick or dealing with bad service all around."}
{"text":"Not blown away, but it's not terrible.

Pros: very clean, nice bright decor, local and family owned. Fresh and healthy menu.

Cons: VERY overpriced. They are really stingy with the portion sizes. I had to ask if the drink cup I received with my \"special\" was a water cup, it was that ridiculously small. The food is healthy but not at all flavorful. 

Note: THEY DO NOT HAVE PANINIS even though it says that on the menu, which was disappointing since that's what I wanted. I don't think the owners know what a panini is honestly. You get a toasted sandwich. 

I had the Green Chicken panini, which wasn't a panini at all, just a tiny toasted sandwich. It was really bland. They need to throw a little salt and some red onion on it. Something. My husband had the chicken salad wrap, which was a little tastier, but not much.

If they would season the food, up the portion sizes, switch to normal sized drink cups so I'm not insulted when they hand it to me, OR lower the prices, I would probably give it a second chance. Since my husband no longer works in the area and I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a healthy dinner and it's one of our new favorite spots in town. We'll definitely be coming back. The experience started with exceptional customer service and help with recommendations to place our order. Everything was made to order and fresh. There are many dressings to choose from, made from scratch, no MSG. The brown rice bowl with tuna, grilled veggies, and egg was delicious. The salads were extremely good and filling as well!"}
{"text":"Nice salad and they did not overcook the steak. Wife and I both enjoyed the tea selections and the crab Rangoon appy."}
{"text":"Interesting lunch spot in the South Phoenix area - I've been twice and each time I felt so proud of myself for eating so healthily!  Each time I had a salad, and they were both fresh and yummy.  Many of the dishes have an Asian influence and it's cool to see a place with a variety of tasty dishes instead of the usual humdrum lunch spots like Chipotle and Subway.  They are slightly more expensive than a typical lunch spot, but they still appear to have a loyal fan base of office workers in the area. I will definitely return the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The service was a little slow. The food was good. My partner found a strand of hair in his food. They quickly brought out a replacement dish and did not offer a refund."}
{"text":"I ordered shrimp fiesta wrap and it was half its normal size. There wasn't one piece of shrimp in sight after two bites. I called and was hung up on twice and put on hold two times after then they disconnected.  The worst experience this time around. I am a two times a week customer and you just lost me."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Great, healthy food (and I usually avoid that like the plague haha!)."}
{"text":"Live in the area and have never been. Hands down best place for salads. If your craving a salad the pictures that you see is what the food really looks like. Some pictures are deceiving and may not taste so great, not here its as good as the pic.
Walked in and it was very empty which was ok because i wasnt sure on what to order. The gentleman who took my order was very knowledgable on the flavors which helped me pick a perfect salad. 
I would totally recommend this place especially for picky eaters who are not big on trying new things. My husband who is not a salad guy and is a big meat eater really enjoyed. 
If you want beef, shrimp, tuna or basically anything different on your salad this is the place to go.
Panini, wraps and flat breads are what i  will be trying next. 
Awesome service"}
{"text":"I just finished eating here while I waited for my husband who works nearby to get off work.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I got the C-squared panini which is well seasoned grilled chicken, bacon, greens, avocado, blue cheese and a lemon aioli.  It was delicious.  It also came with a side salad with some sort of yummy dressing (maybe a soy dressing) and that was delicious as well.  Everything looked and tasted fresh!  I will definitely be going back within the next couple days to try more of their menu.  If you are a salad/sandwich lover such as myself, then you will absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"So as anyone can see from my reviews, this is my third review of Green Mix. I went from 5 stars when they first opened down to 3 stars because they were skimping on things.

Now for an update. If I could give 4 1/2 stars I would. They have gone back to the way things were when they first opened. Better portions, fresh food & a very clean restaurant. It always makes me happy when I see restaurants take comments from Yelp and fix any problems there might be and it looks like Green Mix has done just that. Good job Green Mix you have gotten me back as a loyal customer.

A couple things I would like to see implemented. Maybe some better lunch deals, sandwich's are still a bit pricey for being next to Subway. The quality of your food blows Subway away but we are in a deep recession and a $5 foot long seems more appealing. The other thing and the BIGGEST complaint I have is NO KIDS menu. When I drive by at night the place is a ghost town and it might be because families will not come to Green Mix because of the lack of a kids menu. I know for our family, with 4 kids, you will never get our night or weekend business because there is NO KIDS menu. Why not have a grilled cheese or BLT that can be put on something other then a panini.

Other then that, good job getting the food portions and standards back to where they were when you first opened."}
{"text":"Gave it a try yesterday.  Ordered the build your own salad which with their $3 chicken came out to over $10.  Place felt like they were using a swamp cooler, could not have eaten in so got it to go.  Salad was hot due to the microwaved chicken being placed in the greens.  Honey walnut vinaigrette was watery and tasteless.  Had hoped for better.  I guess AJ's salad is still a better deal for fresher food.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I love the concept, but they do not execute very well. The inside really could be cleaner. Clutter on the counters and just generally a lack of pride in the eating area. Agree with other reviewers that the Hawaiian chicken is rubbery and more \"fish like\" in texture. Portions are decent size though. Service was okay, nothing special. Don't think i'll be back."}
{"text":"The rice lacked flavor. The vegetables in the chicken soup were cut way too big. The broth if tge soup tasted like red pepper and water. No one came to our table to check on us."}
{"text":"The sign for Mixed Greens has been up for a few weeks and I have been eagerly anticipating the first time that I could go. Right now it is in a \"soft opening\" period where I guess they figure out what people in south phoenix like in a salad. For today I chose to get the Mango shrimp salad. It had a number of ingredients that I am a huge fan of. It had things like mango (duh) avocado, grilled shrimp (that I think they made right then) and Parmesan cheese. I am really enjoyed my salad. The dressing was tasty (I am not good at describing flavors) and a bit spicy and I ate the whole thing! It is of course brand new and so the help was incredibly friendly. They came around a few times checking to make sure that we enjoyed the food and that everything was too our liking. My wife ordered a rice bowl and it was a bit light on the sauce so he quickly brought out more! The tables were clean and it was a very open environment.
 
Here is the reality of this restaurant as I see it. In south phoenix we all complain a bit about the lack of choices as far as food is concerned. There are plenty of fried foods and Mexican places but nothing much after that. If you want variety and choice, supporting this place would be a great start. The food is good and the service is great. You can tell that they want to be successful by the efforts they make. If you like salad with unique flavors and awesome meats (like seared tuna, and steak) then you will probably like this place. If you don't eat here than I hope you eat dirt."}
{"text":"No. Just no. My romaine lettuce was 90% stem. The cucumbers were soft and nasty. The 1.00 for extras consisted of a very small portion of bacon and 1/8th of an avocado. The chicken is as processed as chicken can get. I'm talking McDonalds style chicken. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I have mixed thoughts on this spot... so let's start with the Good... they have a shrimp mango salads that's to die for and a Korean BBQ salad that's awesome as well.. they use huge shrimp and lots of fresh ingredients and are pretty fast when filling orders ... okay so Now the BADDD... the salads are really expensive ... I mean more then most places that range at $10... this places starts at $15.00... super high and a once and a blue moon type place ... the other is... the last time I went into the place to order ... I was standing at the counter awaiting my to go order and what do I spy from my left eye ... a roach running over the partition where the food is prepped and the bagged ... whattt!!!!.... I immediately started searching for the rating notice in the window ... it wasn't just any-t roach it was one that is bread from dirt ... not the run of the meal kinds we see in the yard but like a house roach..... bien ... me thinks this was my last time coming ... I mean I know the door was open ... but if having the door open means u getting visitors of the wretch kind ... that means ... CLOSE ThE DOoR !!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little stop with healthy and inventive food. The brown rice bowls were perfectly cooked, with amazing sauce. The paninis are also delicious, especially with a side of vegetables. Really great place for a quick meal, with very nice staff."}
{"text":"Oh man....I'm so happy right now!! I just tried this place for the first time; made my own steak salad. Every ingredient was delicious!! Definitely the new spot!"}
{"text":"The homemade salad dressings make this place. The food is fresh, green, and you dont feel like you want to go confess to your priest when you are done eating."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here from PHX airport looking for a healthier lunch option in the area...you know when you just really want a sandwich or a salad instead of burgers and fries? We chose GreenMix because it wasn't a far drive and we could get our meal to go. 

There was nobody in the eatery. Sure it was the Saturday before Mother's Day at 11:45 am, but I was surprised to not see any other customers. Oh well, it gave us the opportunity to get a personal welcome by a nice Asian lady who showed us what the menu had to offer. She even asked where we were from and was overall friendly and motherly!

As for the environment, the tables and chairs were very clean (in fact, the lady that greeted us was wiping down the windows when we came in). There's no grimy feel about this place. 

On another note, there was just one girl working in the back making our order. I imagine if you come on a busier day you might have to wait awhile for your food. It took ours about 8-10 minutes with no one else coming in while we were here. 

What we ordered:
-Green Chicken Sandwich ($7.95): contains grilled chicken, spinach, avocado, green apple, smoked Gouda, and chipotle dressing - also comes with side salad
-Honey Walnut Chicken salad ($9.95): has grilled chicken, green apple, walnuts, feta, & chickpeas on a bed of spinach with honey walnut vinaigrette


Listen to what everyone has said and go with the Green Chicken sandwich!! Soft bread, great textures with the apples inside, juicy chicken, and just a little too much creamy chipotle dressing. The salad was good, fresh ingredients, and again, juicy chicken with little pops of flavor from the walnuts!


I like what they've done in creating new flavor combos and yet there's also an option for create-your-own sandwich or salad. I'd recommend this place for fresh sandwiches and salads with a tasty twist. Skip Subway (which happens to be right next store) and find a new sandwich to fall in love with (I'm going to try to recreate this at home in NorCal!)."}
{"text":"This place is more than just salads! My fianc√© and I came here for a light lunch because we knew we were going to have a heavy dinner. She got a smoked turkey panini and I got a fiesta shrimp panini and split it so we each had half. Both were excellent! Every panini comes with a side salad with their delicious house dressing and everything is made fresh by a very friendly staff. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice healthy selection of salads, paninis, wraps and Hawaiian BBQ. You also have the option to build your own salad. I went for the Asian BBQ beef salad and am glad I did! Spring mix, jicama, carrots, orange, breadcrumb and a delicious spicy ponzu vinegerette! The cashier also recommended the C Square which can be served as a salad or sandwich. If you're in the area, they are worth it for lunch!! About $9-15."}
{"text":"Well the salads are average size and pretty good. The price is a little high for salad but I struggle with the price of salads everywhere. I think this is a good alternative for eating out if you are trying to be healthy. The customer service is good so that helps. I'm just not a big salad fun but you should stop and try it."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this place while on vacation in AZ. We both created our own salads with romaine lettuce and other toppings. The romaine was not fresh and green as expected. The other toppings were ok but we felt as if we could have created a better salad at home. We wasted $20 at this place...will not be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious food...explosive flavors a must try if ur in so. Mountain area...had the Fiesta shrimp panini and my honey had the Korean bbq panini...yum yum...please try"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it less stars. I went here because I was so sure I could get something that was gluten-free and dairy-free.

If you have food allergies, DO NOT GO HERE. They cannot tell you what is in their salad dressings. I tried to explain that I had food allergies in a very simple way, and was refused an ingredient list. She said they did not have one and she did not know what was in their \"homemade\" dressings. 

Homemade my ass.

I left. I detest Applebee's but they were much more accommodating."}
{"text":"Live this place. Great quality food. Portions are good. Wish get were a bit bigger but good nonetheless. Prices little high. But still worth it. Love their food (:"}
{"text":"I love my Korean BBQ beef sandwich! The flavor is perfect, the size is enough for me. It's not too large or small. They served fast. Great place to hangout too. I would like to go back!"}
{"text":"Both things we tried were to die for. Even bought a large container of the house dressing to take home. Fresh ingredients. Chicken cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"I drive all over town for work and anytime I'm in the area,  I have to come here.   Their daily chicken special is the best! Their ingredients are always fresh and bright with flavor and the meat is super juicy and tender.  I don't really leave many reviews,  but I feel like this is kind of a hidden gem in Phoenix and needs a little more attention."}
{"text":"I really like this place, usually hit it up at least once a week for lunch. The grilled tuna and smoked Gouda wrap is amazing! The BBQ chicken lunch special is great food for not a lot of money. They smile when taking your order and I still haven't ordered anything that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. 

In my book, for a quick lunch spot this place is one of the best bets around."}
{"text":"They offer wraps, paninis and make your own salads. It is pretty healthy and since I'm trying to lose weight, like everyone else for the new year, this place works out great for me. 

I really like their green chicken wrap. It is a spinach wrap with grilled chicken, spinach, avocado, green apple, smoked Gouda cheese and creamy chipotle dressing. The whole mixture is super good. I will definitely have to come back to try something else on the menu"}
{"text":"The food here is really good, however i feel its on the pricey side for what it is. I recently got a chicken panini and it was $10. It came with a small side salad but still a little steep in my opinion.

Buuuut, food is great, healthy and clean. There are many options and if you're indecisive like me it could take a while to decide as everything looks good, haha"}
{"text":"CLOSED. This place has a new owner, and has not reopened. It appears to have been closed for a while."}
{"text":"Green mix is amazing!!! 

The place is very clean and has friendly staff that greets you as you walk in. The menus are on the wall, you fill it out and hand it to the cashier. You can pick from their signature items that include salads, rice bowls, and paninis. Or... You can customize your own salad by choosing your greens, toppings, and dressing! I've tried many items on their menu and I have yet to dislike anything. The dressings have a lot of flavor, from sweet to savory and everything in between. By far, my favorite item is the greenmix tuna panini! To die for... You can have the tuna well done or seared. I like seared. It has Gouda cheese, fresh jalape√±os (for that extra crunch), cilantro, onions, greens, and their house dressing! Perfection!! Great place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I go here almost every day over my lunch hour. With a menu like this, it never gets old! And it is a much healthier alternative to the Subway that sits next door! The staff is friendly, service is fast and the food is great. Highly recommend this gem!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here on a whim and were not let down. We ordered the green chicken panini and the earthly chicken panini. Both were delicious, but we were surprised by how good the side salad was. The GreenMix house dressing was the highlight for me in the simple green salad. It has enticed me enough to try a salad on my next visit, and I have my eyes on the tender steak salad. The staff were also super nice and helpful.

This was a refreshing change of pace and a nice food option for a shopping center that only has franchise eateries in it."}
{"text":"Well, we decided to try this location because it's close to our home...big mistake.  It took over 30 minutes to get our take out order.  We ordered the Greek salad, chicken Cobb salad and a panini.  There was one customer in front of us with two items ordered.  The woman making the salads didn't seem to really know what she was doing.  She kept referring to what looked like an ingredient list, measuring and adding each item...SLOWLY.  then a couple came in and entered the kitchen area, and she seemed to stop altogether to go talk to them.  Definitely not focused on the customer experience.  After we ordered there was a rush of several customers, so I feel really bad for them as it was basically empty when I get there and we still waited 30 minutes. 
The food was ok...nothing special.  The grilled chicken on the salad was tasty, but tomatoes were watery with no flavor.  There was a good amount of chicken, perhaps too much on the Cobb salad, but other ingredients were sparse...like the blue cheese and bacon.  It didn't really seem like a Cobb salad at all.
It's quite convenient to my home, but I won't go back...If I'm waiting 30 minutes, I expect the meal to be worth it...It wasn't."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff! Delicious and healthy...can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I came here for the salads.  I've been here a few times before.  There are plenty of Asian inspired salads.  I got the Asian beef salad which included spring mix, jicama, tomatoes, carrots, oranges, cilantro, panko bread crumbs and spicy ponzu vinaigrette.  The vinaigrette is delicious!  You get plenty too so you can drown the salad with the sauce if you'd like.  Surprisingly, the flavors all worked and it was quite tasty.  I would definitely get the salad again.  The price was the only thing that caught me off guard.  It was a bit expensive for the salad."}
{"text":"I had a honey-walnut salad that was bland and overpriced.  I ordered a can of Arizona Iced tea that had a label stating 99 cents but they told me it was $2.50.  I'm pretty sure that is not legal.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend and we thought the food was wonderful!  We shared a fresh made salad and a tuna panini.  The portion size was good sized, in fact, we took half the sandwich home.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and have walked passed this place several times. I finally go for a salad. I will just say this place is Very Unsanitary! The lady behind the counter took my order with one glove on, then proceeded to make my salad with the same glove. This place also has to much food just sitting out in the open and it's very hot inside the building.  :("}
{"text":"The Mango Salad was amazing! Hopefully I can hit this place up one more time before I leave town. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and don't have a lot of healthy lunch options. Good thing I have this place to go to!

I love their brown rice bowls (I've had the chicken and Korean beef, both delicious). Their salads are really yummy, too, but just not substantial enough for me. However, they have been enough for my coworkers, so maybe I just have a huge appetite. I also had this chicken greek wrap as a lunch special and it had so much flavor! It's a great place for lunch and the man, who I believe is the owner, is always very friendly!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great sandwich! Wrap so good my husband got a second! If you build your own salad, it can get a bit pricey adding proteins & additional toppings. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"so i went to greenmix today and the experience was horrible.  owner asked me if i wanted to dine in or carry out, i replied...dine in...now i have eaten many times at this place but always have gotten a bad vibe from the owner. i normally push it to the side because she's never friendly as a business owner should be. well today what i always thought pretty much came to light. a white gentlemen was behind me in line and he was served begore me, now i just assumed his order didn't take as long but when the owner showed up to my table with a styrofoam container when i said i was dining in ..i was appalled.  i told her i wanted a plate..she insisted that i can eat from the container. i'm like, i would like a plate, she points to the white man and says..a plate like his? yes please but yet still told me i can just eat from the containeri.she snatched the container and bag and walked away. i'm like she didn't even apologize..so i requested my refund...she slammed it on counter and not placing it in my hand. no apology, no eye contact..etc..
i will never eat here again because obviously black people should eat from the containers and not there plates! sad sad sad!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in the neighborhood. We were hesitant at first. However, once  our salads arrived, the taste was great and the veggies on it were generous. My daughter had chicken on her salad, the chicken was an entire grilled breast, much more than expected!!!
The spicy Thai salad dressing was great. We will be going back. My only suggestion would be to have more veggie options for the build it yourself salad, like cucumbers, carrots, mushrooms, etc."}
{"text":"I was excited to go to a healthy place.  The items from the menu sounded yummy.  I ordered two green chicken paninis.  As I was going to pay, the cashier blew her nose in front of us.  I didn't think much of it until she headed to the back to make/prepare food.  I was shocked to see that she didn't wash her hands or put on gloves prior to touching food.  I didn't request a refund because I saw a sign stating that they don't do refunds only credit.  I just took the food and threw it away once I got home."}
{"text":"I've been waiting here for half an hour. 10 minutes to order, 20 minutes to get the food. There are only 6 people in the entire place, so I thought this would be a lot faster. 

When I finally got the food (a spicy something chicken bowl), it tasted like a chicken bowl lost a fight to a bottle of red wine vinegar. This would be good for someone who really likes vinegar, but that's not me. 

All in all, not the worst, but definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend recently down in Arizona and wanted to grab a healthy lunch near her house.  To my surprise, there really wasn't a lot of tasty options to choose from until I stumbled upon this little gem on Yelp.  I ordered the C Square sandwich while my girlfriend got The Farm.  It was nice to see that our sandwiches both came with a side salad as well.  Both of us were in awe after taking our first bites of our sandwiches.  They were that good!  Not only that, but the side salad with the orange sesame vinaigrette dressing was superb.  We savored every bite until our plates were bone dry.  The owner, who was super friendly, even came over to chat with us and tell us about his amibtions of expanding.  Should I ever visit again, I will definitely be back here to get my fix."}
{"text":"I have actually never posted a review on Yelp until today because today, I had the worst meal I have ever had and I had to do something to let others know. If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. My husband and I visited here today for the first time for his lunch break... We both got wraps- I got the smoked turkey and he got the Triple C. We took two bites and could not finish our meal. The \"salad\" that came with the wraps was literally romaine lettuce drenched in a sickly sweet orange vinaigrette and both wraps were oozing with this disgustingly sweet mayonnaise, so much so that we both felt sick to our stomachs immediately after taking two bites and for the rest of the day. The wraps were ridiculously overpriced for such a gross meal... We would have been much better off going to Subway. And healthy? Between the dressing, mayonnaise and cheap meat they use, that's just false advertising. Complete rip-off!"}
{"text":"I'm not as impressed as I thought I'd be. I ordered a veggie salad. It came on a bed of spring mix with carrots, squash, broccoli, onions, and asparagus. I knew it'd be fairly simple, which I wanted. However, it would've been nice if they were grilled or seasoned with something. If not that, clearly state it on the menu. The pictures displayed throughout the restaurant definitely look appetizing, but I was kind of disappointed."}
{"text":"Brown rice bowl with beef & veggies was delicious. Looking to stay healthy have some good carbs with protein. Hit the spot for me!"}
{"text":"I had their special on the board which was brown rice, korean beef bbq, salad, and chicken veggie soup. I also ordered salad and steak for my bf. Lets start with the meal I ordered. The brown rice had too much water in it. It was very mushy which was a waste because I didn't even bother eating it after. Korean bbq was cooked medium well which is how I like it. It was tasty and delish. Salad was great, veggies were fresh and it came with a salad dressing which tasted like the in and out sauce. Very yummy. My bf salad was good also and his steak was also cooked medium well. Everything we ordered was great besides the rice I wish they would have cooked it better. It's okay though the service was awesome. Overall this place wasnt too bad knowing its in the southside phoenix area.."}
{"text":"Good but the portion for the salads are really really small. I feel like the lettuce is all gone after 4 folks bites."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Fresh, made to order and good prices. Service is subpar at  best. Not sure if the lady owns the place or is a cashier but I have been back several times for the food and she manages to be rude, short and irritated every time."}
{"text":"good fresh food place. i'm not a big salad eater. but the sandwich i got was amazing. try it out, the place really wasn't for me. but it's great, go see if it's for you."}
{"text":"I had the asian bbq and the korean bbq panini and wow, so amazing. The beef is so soft and tender its really amazing and the sizes were great it was 21 dollars and well spent. Im a part time vegetarian and only eat meat 2 times out of the month and i feel like i made the right choice, really reccomend this place not just for the price but the quality of the food  aw well  made my tummy smile."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times my meals were really tasty.  The first time I had the Thai shrimp salad, and the second time I had the Korean Beef BBQ wrap (it's listed as a sandwich, but you can get any salad or sandwich as a wrap instead, which is a nice touch).  The Korean BBQ wrap was REALLY delicious!  However, I would have preferred the red onions to have been cut into thinner slices -- I'm not a fan of chunks of red onion.  So I just picked some of them out and continued to enjoy my wrap.  

However, I have to agree with other reviewers that the portion sizes do not match the prices.  $10 for a wrap is a bit on the high side, especially for a fast food alternative.  With Subway next door selling $5 footlongs, they might want to consider lowering their prices if they're trying to attract the fast food crowd."}
{"text":"The food was light and fresh yet filling and the staff there Ellie ( ee-lee?) Was fantastic. She took our order and answered any questions we had about the menu. I settled on the brown rice bowl with jumbo shrimp and sweet chili sauce. She let us taste the sauces beforehand to ensure we got what we liked. They have awesome add ons you wouldn't expect like portobello mushrooms and ones you would like avocado. My coworker got a chicken spinach wrap with choice of 5 veggies and she had no complaints. The gal that took our order also made our food and brought it out to us. She was happy to bring us hot sauce etc. She later cleared our table. She did it all basically. I highly recommend. Don't let the shopping/strip mall surroundings deter you from a healthy well made food option."}
{"text":"I was visiting some family over thanksgiving holiday and needed something healthy to eat after gorging myself on vagina i mean vegetarian stuffing.  So I came here on Friday and had a roasted veggie salad.  It tasted really fresh and flavor was tasty without being overpowering.  So we came back on Saturday and I had a veggie Panini, again it was two thumbs up. Best Panini I have EVER had. 

I don't really know Phoenix too well, but this place is definitely a gem. I do wish they had a larger salad menu.  For a name like GreenMix, they would do good to have more than 1 vegetarian salad, but they will probably expand their menu in the future, I think the place just opened."}
{"text":"food was fresh and delicious and very flavorful. everything on the menu sounds great! we will definitely be back! prices are pretty good except for the fact that if you order their specialty salads, just be sure you can't get the same thing on the build your own salad menu because that is the cheaper route. we got the sweet thai chicken salad that was advertised as their special for 14 something, nothing special but it was delicious! but you could have built your own salad with chicken and same dressing and added more veg for only 10. we figured this after we got our food and was a little confused and annoyed but whatever."}
{"text":"We were headed to Applebee's for a salad a couple of years ago and happened upon this place. The owner took our order and made our salads and was very nice. Food and service were both great!"}
