{"text":"Good burger, but overpriced. Had a Park Burger, which was $9 after tax, but was still hungry afterward. It would be nice to see a combo offered in the $10-12 range to compete with the other options in the area."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Staff was super friendly. Food came out pretty quick and was better than expected. Had the cheeseburger with side of fries which the whole meal was tasty and well seasoned. The size of the patty was decent. Would probably get a double if i was really hungry. Will try this place again and try out the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Location/Service - Along Consumers Rd, on the ground of level of the parking complex across from Shoppers Drug Mart - Very nice interior, earthy-feeling to it. I expected it to be more loud, but it's quiet and gives off a comfy environment - Staff were nice and friendly. Orders are a little longer than expected, but I think it will improve overtime once things are more smooth  Food - Ordered a Park Burger + Sweet Potato Fries (~$13 after tax) - Burger was pretty good, beef was still juicy, chewy and not dry. A little messy to eat (but it's wrapped around). But it didn't give me a 'wow' factor - Fries were good and complimented very well with their curry sauce. Sauce was not spicy, similar feeling to spicy mayo/chipotle. Fries weren't oily and still fresh/crunchy  Overall it's a nice place for a quick lunch, they do offer it to-go. Would be better if they have a combo idea - everything is an individual item."}
{"text":"The honey butter chicken burger on a brioche was fresh, crunchy and moist.  The crinkled fries perfect for a ketchup commercial!  Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This place has been open for around a month now. It's a cute place with a good amount of seating. We got takeout and in the car we tried the sweet potato fries and the normal fries. They are really good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They're not greasy at all which is amazing. The curry ketchup and special sauce that it comes with weren't really my cup of tea though.   The burgers though are more like glamorous Big Macs which was slightly disappointing. I mean, I'm personally not a fan of Big Macs but for those that do like them, I'm sure they'll like this place."}
{"text":"Please, do yourself a favor and try this place. You won't regret it. The food is great and you can taste the fact that they know their stuff. The burger is juicy and well seasoned. The burger to bun ratio is perfect and the sauces are great. Their Park Burger is their signature piece and I'd recommend you start with that if it's your first time.   The fries are excellent. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. And they either come with a curry ketchup (so simple and yet so good, why no one gave me a curry ketchup before) and their fry sauce is out of this world.  They also have an assortiments of shakes. The  Nutella  is pure indulgence and your taste buds will thank you for it. The Strawberry Sherbet tastes sophisticated and I highly recommend it.  Finally, the one thing that made me go from 4 to 5 stars was the staff. Extremely friendly, they accommodated my kids wishes. They were super understanding, which meant I spent a memorable time with my daughters and we left laughing. It was more than just a great burger place. It was a memorable experience. I hope that's what you'll find there too."}
{"text":"I tried a chicken sandwich that was totally delightfully fresh with an amazing chopped  veggie dressing  on a brioshe bun.  Definitely going to experience other fresh items in the menu."}
{"text":"Came by twice and each time blown away by the whole experience.  The atmosphere truly feels like  your outdoors enjoying your meal over an upscale picnic.   On the first visit I had the spicy chicken sandwich and it was the juiciest chicken burger I've had and about double the size of what I anticipated.  The honey butter and soft bun are truly what make this.  Second time I tired the veggie burger and it was indescribable.  Something similar to a a large falafel but softer and lighter tasting.  I could almost identify each ingredient and the fresh cucumbers were super refreshing. Whatever you choose when you go be sure to get an order of the sweet potato fries!  Perfectly crunchy yet flavorful."}
{"text":"Had the Park Burger and fries. The beef, while fresh, tasted like McDonalds. Bread was soggy from the grease. And the fries and sauce were nothing to write home about. I was really expecting more, given the price of the meal which came out to around 13 bucks. I was so excited too, because I live just around the corner. I will most likely give them one more chance when I try the reputed chicken burger."}
{"text":"Awesome new burger spot! Went in with no expectations--just wanted to try something new. Burgers were made to order and delicious! Excellent quality meat with a nice char. Sweet potato fries were great too. Love the interior decor/seating. The manager there is absolutely wonderful...he needs a raise! (And no, I don't know him--lol!) He was very friendly and welcoming to my family and made sure my 3 yr old had a great experience too. That honestly makes the difference in a new place. Keep up the great work! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited! There's a burger place around the corner!  Came in during the soft launch (don't think it was for the public, but ended up opening to everyone). Unfortunately, they didn't have enough food and the staff weren't quite ready yet to handle this volume, so we didn't get to try the food.  No Worries, drop by the next day to claim our free burger the next day.   The burger . The patty was delicious! You can taste it was fresh and not frozen. Delivery was a bit slow, but still 5 stars!! But what got me to knock it down to 3 stars was the fires and the bun that came with that burger.  The bun, it was totally too soft for this delicious and juicy patty.  It was basically soggy by the time I finished taking a picture of it.  The Fries? Ummm it was like $4 bucks and you get as much as a small size fries from McDonald. The fries wasn't amazing, to be honest, it tasted like McCain Super fries.  I know ... this is a burger joint, but fries are very important too! If the fries are good, I'd come in for fries even if I'm not feeling like a burger kinda day.  Highlight of the visit:  Came back 3rd time, still a bit slow. A suggestion, maybe have the sides in a standup by the cashier? Or do what they in downtown, have a sheet of paper and folks can check what they want. (At least during weekday lunch rush).  There were people who left and went for Veal Sandwiches instead.  Food (Taste): 4/5 Food (Presentation): 4/5 Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 3/5 Service: 2/5 (speed of cashier) Ambiance: 5/5 Fun Factor: 5/5"}
