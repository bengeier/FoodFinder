{"text":"Great burgers. Have yet to have a bad meal here. Deep fried pickles a my favorite. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Great burger!  Cross Plains burger waa awesome! Great fries, good service.  Enjoyed the experience!"}
{"text":"First off this place is now called Hooty's Bar and Grill. 

We had time to kill between a wedding and the reception. So where to go in the middle of farm country west of Madison? Not much to choose from.  And there was Hooty's on Main Street in Cross Plains. Our group of 20 swarmed the lone bartender but he handled it well. The classic Wisconsin Brandy Old Fashion sweet was the best I had on this trip. Some food was ordered but I never got a chance to try it.  Everyone had a great time at this local tavern."}
{"text":"Had a great pizza there and would go back for that again. I think the name is changing. A little hard to get to with Main Street being torn up for the entire summer of 2015."}
