{"text":"Located in a worn down food court, this place claims to sell 5-Star Hotel food. 

I beg to differ:
1. Ox Tongue Rice - rice was over cooked and not enough sauce on the ox tongue. The ox tongue itself was easy to slice through with a plastic knife but tasted bland. 

2. Hainese Chicken Rice - For the amount of chicken you get, it's not worth the $6. There was a ladel's worth of grease on the bottom as well. 

Your meal comes with your choice of soy milk or soup, like standard food court meal combos. The wait isn't long since this food court isn't too popular. The seats are occupied by old Asian men playing Chinese Checkers or other store vendors dining by themselves. 

I don't think I would return here, let alone return to this 'mall'."}

I personally didn't noticed anything that really stands out as something other than Chinese/Cantonese food here. Maybe I'm just not familiar with Macanese food and was expecting something that's really different from Chinese food. Anyhow, the face of the stall is entirely covered with pictures and menu items, almost like a wallpaper. Somewhat funny. Somewhat intimidating, even for a Chinese person like myself. I don't really know where to look and what to choose. Sometime too much choices may not necessarily be a good thing.

Luckily I actually wasn't super hungry so I could eliminate most of the heavier rice and noodle choices. I opted for a snack like the Fried Cod Fish Balls. I like it. They're cute and about the size of small eggs. Nicely fried exterior, not greasy, great filling consisting of cod pieces and potato (I think). Hmmm...I don't know what else to say. It's a nice snack and I would get it again."}
{"text":"What's Macau?  Macau is not a Bird of Prey.  Macau is not edible either....  unless you're China in which case you consume Macau and give it an interesting designation known as Special Administrative Regions.  What's Macau famous for?  GAMBLING of course at least for nearby tourists.

Other items of interest of course is Culinary base such as Portuguese-style Chicken, Bacalhau, Pork Chop Bun,  Portuguese Egg Tart and many more.  Where would you FIND Macau flavours in Toronto? Due to the proximity of Macau to Hong Kong, it has always been popular items in Hong Kong style Cafes and it is the same way in Toronto.

Promoted on their Take-out Menu and their counter as 5-star food with Food Court prices, it really doesn't matter as there's really no competition of any nature within this Multi-cultural City.  If any, probably not with 5-star Hotel Chef derived from Macau.  I think of this as similar nature(Food Court) as Gournmet Garden(Malaysian/Singapore) except it's Macanese.

Bacalhau(Cod Fish) Ball(7/$3.50) - Deep-fried Balls with crispy thin exterior holding soft Potato Mash with Bacalhau dices.  It was A-OK for a snack at that price and the Bacalhau is surprisingly not overly salty.  It's not addictive enough of a snack but if friends want to try, I'll bring out the coins.

Portuguese-style Chicken(5.99) - This is nothing like any of what the HK-style Cafes would offer as the Portuguese sauce is neither as gluey, spicy, or salty.  Maybe that's the reason it's not as attractive to me as a sauce on it's own as my palate is used to the more savoury version.

Additions(Olives, Boiled Egg, Sausage) that makes it different from my prior experiences at those HK Cafes that only serves with Onion, Bellpepper, Potato. 

This dish gets the saltiness from those Garnishes and looks better in presentation.   The Steam Rice that came with it wasn't fresh but the Portion of the Portuguese-style Chicken and the perfectly cooked Dark Meat evens that out.

Closed Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Their Hoinan Chicken is fairly good here, but my favourite would have to be the Baked Macau (Portuguese) Chicken Rice. We often come here just to buy it to have something for packed lunch the next day.
The owner is friendly, and are genuinely proud of their food."}
