{"text":"Awesome, Big Ben sandwich is delish and chocolate/strawberry scones is one of the best I have ever had, and can't forget to mention the coffee and tea, great place"}
{"text":"This is where all the cool kids (hipsters nowerdays) go.
They roast the beans inside providing an excellent view of the process, and filling the space with the rich aroma.
The dirty chai here is excellent.

FYI: Park behind the stores, not in front."}
{"text":"The good news:
Cartel is a Tempe staple. For ASU students or people who work nearby it's an awesome luxury to have this place so close. Their iced toddy is the go-to and it's extremely potent. I drank it during midterms and finals all the time, be careful not to drink it on an empty stomach. They do a special version with Horchata, it's called the espresso excelente and it's the best thing in the world if you're into Horchata. Cartel supposedly makes the horchata on-site. The Cappucino is brought in a mug with a plate every time, no to-go, which makes it kind of a cool zen treat if the place isn't too crowded. When it IS crowded it's sometimes for cool stuff. That OBEY graffiti artist guy put on a show there once, which was neat.

The bad news:
It's a bit pricey. Everything in the place is going to cost you more than usual. It costs $4:50 for the excelente, which means I don't really go to Cartel that often. I feel like Gold Bar and Xtreme Bean do better in the pricing range. They expanded the place since I last went and everything is foreign to me. They serve beer now apparently, and bought out a nearby business to expand and accommodate more people, but the new layout is a little awkward. Come to think of it the last layout was a little awkward too, and I still went there all the time...



Pro: They support local artists and put on gallery shows.
Pro: Hipsters everywhere.
Pro: Usually a decent-sized crowd in there.
Pro: Horchata supercoffee.

Con: Very few electrical outlets. Take note, students.
Con: Hipsters everywhere.
Con: Usually a decent-sized crowd in there.
Con: Expensive.

What I'm trying to say is that Cartel has achieved perfect harmony in the universe by having just as many reasons to go there as to not go there."}
{"text":"Amazing cappuccino!  Smooth and nutty roast -- not burnt or over-extracted.  Well-done."}
{"text":"First and foremost, they roast their own beans. Any coffe shop who roasts their own beans has a real passion for the product. The feel of the place is very hipster, yet rugged, and very easy to stay engaged when looking for a place to do homework or have a meeting. 

One thing that really astounded me about this place is the simplicity of the menu. A simple yet quality selection is best in my opinion. From their mocha to just a plain old cup of joe, their drinks are delicious! They make a mean Toddy as well...."}
{"text":"If you like burnt, dark, bitter-tasting coffee, then starbux is just up the road for you. This place serves the finest coffee I have ever tasted. If you're just starting out here, ask for their basic cappuccino and you'll be in heaven!  For more adventurous tastes, ask the barista as they really know the product they sell.  If you're lucky enough to come in when they're roasting, even better. And the music is just first class

Now if it were just open a little later than 10pm it would be perfected!"}
{"text":"I found Cartel Coffee Lab in Scottsdale to have kind of an interesting vibe. It has an industrial feel to it inside, not homey or inviting. There is long bench-style seating in their main room which was very warm even at 9 a.m. Then there is a side \"breezeway\" area (much cooler) with standard tables but not-so-comfortable chairs. There's also a sterile looking back room if you want total quiet. There is comfortable, unobtrusive music playing in the background. The coffee offerings are limited (don't expect a Starbucks) and an even smaller offering of pastries, but they do offer local craft beers. The barrista(?) behind the counter greeted us with more of a sneer than a smile, and coldly stated they did not have the dark roast coffee I asked for but had \"lightly roasted coffee and roasted their own beans\". Sounded more like a public address announcement than a benefit. What I actually got was and expensive cup of acidic coffee. I assume they have a loyal group of local customers who prefer \"rustic\" coffee and the story that goes along with it, but I prefer a good, reasonably priced cup of coffee instead. I'll probably not return."}
{"text":"Um...WOW.  This is a tremendous cup of coffee.  I am a huge fan of how this coffee is prepared.  First, they roast their own beans (or so I read, I'll have to double check this) but most importantly they grind the beans upon order, then use the European style of brewing.  They pour almost boiling water slowly and methodically over the grounds and let it drip through a drip pot.  Each cup is brewed this way.  It takes a little longer but totally worth the wait. So much more flavorful and rich.  I have yet to find another coffee spot that does it this way.  My only dislike was the location I visited was a bit dark and could use a little more welcoming atmosphere but the coffee is really what it's about and I just wish there was one closer to where I live, I would be a daily customer."}
{"text":"Super super super psyched that Cartel is at the airport. I finally get away from Starbucks! Not that I don't love Starbucks, but sometimes - well, most of the time - I just want a coffee that's free of all the frills and shtuff that Starbucks has. They always know how to make my chai just right! The people are super friendly and know their coffee! They make the walk through security worth it!"}
{"text":"I never knew this place was here until my friend brought me here. I'm an anti-Starbucks girl and I'm a bit picky when it comes to my coffee places, but this place was really good. And I really like their chai and I'm not one for chai, or maybe it's just Starbucks chai. This place is deceiving; it looks tiny from the outside, but when you go in, it's bigger than it looks. The artwork that adorns the space is really cool and interesting. I just wish this place was open later."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing.  I first started coming here for a good cup of coffee in between meetings downtown.  They have some of the best espresso drinks I've ever had.  They also have some kind of \"clover\" machine that allows the barista to control many aspects of how the coffee is brewed, etc.

I have been meaning to grab breakfast/lunch there as all of the food looks amazing.  Today, I stopped in for some lunch and the barista/waitress suggested a wrap variation of their turkey sandwich that included roasted peppers, pesto, and some other goodies.  I have to say this is the best lunch I've had in Phoenix and will be a regular from now on.  This place is a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Please stop it with the attitude. I asked for an \"iced coffee\" and barista said:  \"do you mean iced toddy?\" Umm..sure whatever. Just get me some caffeine with iced over it. 

Oh and don't ask for skim milk if you don't want a lecture. 

I used to go here often since I like supporting small businesses but now with all the new coffee shops opening up in the area I will be supporting them instead."}
{"text":"Cool little place if you can find it. I got lucky wandering for ice cream."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Cartel for the better part of 3 years, living a 5 minute walk or so from the shop. I'm usually here 3 + times per week. They have the best roasts and steeped coffee of any coffee shop I've been to, anywhere, hands down. The coffee is purchased by the owner and roasted in house, and when they run out of a bean, its gone, so if you find a variety you really like stock up as much as possible! The coffee is super fresh and it shows. At any one time they have 5-6 beans available, and you can have them prepared with a variety of methods including pour over and aeropress. 

I would say the espresso drinks are good, although not quite as good as the brewed coffee. The espresso by itself tends to be sour and really needs to be paired with milk to take the edge off. 

Customer service has improved over the past 3 years, enough that I have noticed. I think there has been some turnover in staff, where some of departed staff members would straight up ignore customers for several minutes while chatting with friends, the ones I see now are friendly and knowledgeable. When it is busy it can take 20+ minutes to get your drink, especially if you ordered freshly brewed coffee.

The clientele is hilariously hipster, with flannel, facial hair, and apple computers being almost mandatory, but that doesn't change the quality of the coffee!"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow! This is the best coffee I have ever had in the U.S. I'm going to start flying Southwest more just so I can grab a cup of this rich deliciousness before I get on my flight."}
{"text":"I got a Large Hot Latte $5. Not too bad for an airport. I didn't care for the burnt taste. I assume that is just some well roasted beans, but hey I don't drink that much coffee."}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST coffee in AZ.  If you like good coffee (i.e. light roasted and you know what an Aeropress, Chemex, Hario is) look no further. I'm a big fan of light-medium body with fruit or caramel notes. I highly recommend the Arada or the Aricha. Those have been my 2 faves since going regularly for the past 9 months. I ordinarily will get a bag of beans for my at-home morning Aeropress. They run about $15-20ish bucks a bag. While I've had some excellent quality coffee beans for a little cheaper, the price is well worth it. Sometimes I will also stay and treat myself to a manual Aeropress or Hario, and service is excellent. I recommend a manually brewed cup, because it's much purer, and it feels like the barista makes the cup just for you, personalized, usually with a fun coffee cup (my last one was an old school mug with Bambi on it, haha). Staff is really down to earth, cool, friendly, and helpful. If curious about what kind of beans you may like, ask them, and you'll get superb recommendations. The quality of this coffee is premium. It may very well be the best I've had. I also love that they roast in house and also have beer on the other side of the bar.

I really want to give this 5 stars. If I'm going off purity of coffee alone, this is easily 5, BUT you also need to take into account atmosphere when you go here. If you're going to hang out with friends or people watch, it's great. A little hipster, but I admittedly enjoy that in a place. However, if you're looking for a quiet and relaxing coffee house getaway, this is not the place for you. If you don't study or read or write well in crowds, get your coffee to go. The place is usually bustling, and they play music loudly (I get the feeling the employees just plug in their ipods to speakers). This is my only criticism. Sometimes I want a relaxing, quiet coffee shop experience, and Cartel -- for all its excellent coffee quality -- doesn't provide that. I think once, a weekday afternoon -- when they were playing Arthur Russell's \"Soon-To-Be Innocent/Let's See\" (kuddos to the employee who had that on their ipod) -- it was lovely and chilled out, but that was a rare exception."}
{"text":"Best airport espresso
Nice well made espresso and baked goods- completely unexpected find in airport"}
{"text":"As visitors to Tempe, we had a tricky time finding this place... That's because it's in the back of what looks like an old motel and not visible from University. If you see the Buffalo Exchange on University and head around the back, you'll find it on the end unit. 

I loved the atmosphere, the artwork was killer and the staff were really friendly.  I got the sense that indie artists were well supported by this place and that it attracted some really interesting folks. 
The coffee was good, the variety of pastries and snacks was decent, there's free wifi and the over-all vibe was good. 

I do wish they had different sizes of \"to stay\" mugs, but overall it's a great place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Phoenix, you should be thrilled.  This is the best coffee \"place\" I've ever visited.  I use quotes - it's beyond a \"cafe\".  It is a lab.  These folks are serious - like their clientele.  The coffee is sublime.  I was in Phoenix for a conference and discovered (thank you Yelp) this amazing coffee source.  First morning was their cold brew and a Cowgirl cookie.   Totally delicious and refreshing.  Next morning I tried their Clover machine (yes, they have one!!!), this time with one of their scones.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!  My last mornining I ran over and got another cold brew (it's Phoenix and bloody hot!) and that fabulous Cowgirl cookie again.  Luxurious flavors.  I bought one of each of their roasts to take home and I've told them they MUST open in New York, preferably Brooklyn.  We are ready for them.  Brooklynites are the kind of coffee hounds these folks would appreciate and we are so ready for them.  If you are in Phoenix and love your coffee, go visit.  And as a bonus, the staff at this location were fantastic folks (hey, they could move to New York too, they're so cool.)  I can't rave enough about this place!  Go, visit, drink coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Cartel has ruined me for all other coffee, this is best coffee I've ever had. Sometimes it can take a while waiting in line, but its always worth it and the staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"The \"Iced Toddy\" has helped me through many a night, and is delicious. :) Love Cartel."}
{"text":"Cartel has been part of my coffee rotation for a few years now. I've visited all current locations and loved them all equally. This one in-particular is my favorite, with a bright and airy lounge to enjoy one of their specialty brews and a cool and comfortable patio, they really know how coffee was meant to be enjoyed. Six rotating taps of local beers along with wine, I make sure to visit at least once a week to see what new wonderful drinks they're serving.

Rather than bombard you with displays of miscellaneous drinks and snacks from 3rd party companies, (energy drinks, soda, bottled water, etc.) Cartel focuses on the only thing a coffee shop should; great coffee.

However, the costumer service is not as consistent as some of the other shops I frequent. I worked as a barista in a shop not unlike Cartel for a few years, and I understand that it's very hard to be at your best a hundred percent of the time, but I feel the staff could be a bit more honest and kind to their customers,

Still, I enjoy Cartel immensely and I'll still be stopping by for a quality brew when I can. Don't miss a chance to check out this little shop for a nice coffee and a relaxed vibe."}
{"text":"Employees were very friendly. We were visiting Phoenix and came across them while shopping. Coffee is ground and brewed fresh cup by cup. Lots of college age kids with laptops though taking up the very little seating available, but we managed to find a seat."}
{"text":"All the reviews tell it straight! The 'What's a Burrito' was delicious. Ingredients amazingly fresh and succulent.  Very friendly staff and the use Square Up as their cash register ...which means you never have to pull your wallet out. Just smile and state your name then they'll email you your receipt!  

Cartel is another great reason to be downtown"}
{"text":"Pros:
Best coffee I've had in Phoenix
Great vibey/trendy atmosphere (very hipster)
Intelligent and friendly staff

Cons:
Lots of \"coffee snobbery\" in the air
Not a lot of wall outlets for plugging in laptop, etc. (had to sit at a small table with 10 other people)

Overall, very good coffee (a must-try for the coffee aficionado), but a little pretentious for my taste.  Will likely go back, but not the most relaxed atmosphere which, to me, is essential in a coffee shop."}
{"text":"This place might have the best coffee in the world for all I know.  I've never tasted it.  I moved here from Seattle and attempted to find a single estate bean similar to one I'm accustomed to.  I visited this location but they were sold out of the beans that I would have liked to have purchased.  I was told that the Scottsdale location would be stocked and worst case they'd have some the next day.  I tried to call Scottsdale to make sure but they didn't answer so.  I decided to drive there anyway only to be disappointed when they were completely sold out as well.  I returned the next day to Tempe and sure enough they still had empty shelves.  I told a barista the story and instead of apologizing she insolently reminded me that she wasn't the one that gave me false information but they should have stock tomorrow.  Well, I've heard that one before and don't plan on wasting any more time trying to give this business my money.  I'll search for a roaster that can deliver a quality bean without the pretention,  attitude, and empty promises.  I suggest you do as well."}
{"text":"First time I've been back to Cartel in a while, and though the space has become much larger with more spaces to hang out, it's the same crappy experience.  Burnt tasting espresso, NO SUGAR, and music that was waaaaaaayyyyy too loud.  I've been to better, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Try the cold brew.  They brew it overnight which makes for a very smooth and easy to drink beverage. It's perfect for the 107 degree heat."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee! Complex and smooth! No sweetener needed.  Food is great too. iPad checkout. Love it."}
{"text":"For all you folks who need coffee to go with your turpentine, Cartel is the place for you!! 

For the rest of us, I hate to pour cold coffee on the Cartel-parade, but I just am not feelin' the love. I ordered an iced cafe mocha. The resulting lukewarm concoction tasted like a very strong brew of chocolate-infused cardboard. *shiver* To tell you the truth, it was vaguely reminiscent of chicory coffee, which is not my \"cup of tea,\" so to speak. I even brought my younger, hipper friend to Cartel to make sure my evaluation was fair, and she now makes a face whenever I mention it!

Try it if you must, since we all like to support our local businesses, but don't blame me if you don't like it..."}
{"text":"Great place! Always crowded, so if you're looking for a quiet spot this is not the coffee shop for you. (Probably because everyone likes it so much...)The coffee/anything else I've ever tried though has been amazing and I am impressed every time. This is my favorite Cartel location. Brewing their own beer is a plus too."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding!  I am always on the lookout for high quality coffee and Cartel has just set a new standard.  They roast their own beans on site and their coffee is the freshest I have ever tasted.  I tried their Mocha and found it incredible well balanced and smooth, with just the right amount of character.  I am very picky about my coffee and the coffee shops I will spend money at...this place is my new favorite in the Phoenix area.  I love the atmosphere and the counter folks were very friendly and knowledgeable.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I just wrote a review on another coffee shop citing what my five star criteria are - I figure I better give an example also - this is it.
Excellent green sourced coffee (they have CoE - cup of excellence varieties available) is roasted and prepared by skilled Baristas right there in the shop.  A variety of single origin and blend bags of beans are for sale - all with roast dates printed on the bags.  Both drip and espresso brewing methods are given the attention to detail that a coffee snob would give at home - and in the end, all the finished products have the quality, variety, and complexity of flavors that excellent coffee should have.
My only complaints would be;  1) They prefer to source all their beans from latin america (my guess is due to locality) - would be nice if they had some Ethiopian and Indonesian varieties as well (just some different notes), and 2) A less than a pound (I believe it's 12oz) bag of CoE beans sells for about $18 / bag (with tax) right now - pretty steep, although I calculate it's that's still only about $1 / cup at home.
Lastly, concerning ambience and service - I don't grade on these factors unless they are significant detractors - and they are definitely not at the Cartel.  However, I will say, I think the complaints about service by other yelpers are unwarranted - this is a shop that caters to coffee snobs and casual drinkers / students alike.  If they tell you that you're ordering real --fill in cup here-- and not --fill in sugared up chain drink here--, that's to try to convey what you're getting so as to not disappoint your whipped-cream loving desensitized pallette (they're doing you a favor).  I personally love the frank and very informative interaction I get with the Baristas at Cartel - I wouldn't trade it at all for the fake bubbly attitude and 25 pieces of flair you get at one of the chains."}
{"text":"If you believe in karma and visited Cartel Monday (3/29) and left your iPod (you know the make and model if you really did)... just ask the barista and they should be holding your mobile jukebox.  I believe in karma and in return from my good deed, I received a 5 star experience coffee experience.

Man, this is a great place to come sit, sip, and vibe.  Tonight I went with the Americano with a Mocha to go for the wife.  Both are stellar drinks and I picked up a bag of the Black Market Espresso to try at home.

As for the sitting, there are a few tables in the front for you to get some one on one time, 2 couches which are fairly comfy and then a lot of cafeteria like arrangements, so if you are a little shy, then grab a cup to go.  I would recommend coming in and feeding off the vibe.  They usually have some form of good music whether it is the speakers or a live DJ.  It is a very industrial feel inside, but the energy is amazing.  

It is also one of the best cups of joe I have experienced in the valley (whether drinking in or taking out).  The coffee has bold rich flavors and it is roasted right there onsite.  If you are in during roasting hours, then that just adds to the overall experience.

Overall it is a very hip indie vibe and my new hot spot while the wife is in her night classes.  Man, this is a great place....oh and don't forget to check your pockets for your iPod."}
{"text":"Cartel is my go to coffee place.  If I could drink here everyday, I would.  The barista who seems to always be working sunday mornings makes the best lattes that I've ever had, ever.  Each one always has a cute little heart or leaf shaped on the top which obviously is their secret as to why they're so delicious.  I've never gotten anything else because I've already discovered the best.  If you're cool, you probably like to hang out here on the reg.    
I definitely recommend, best coffee in Tempe by far. 
It's a little hard to find if you've never been before, right off university on ash across from the circle k."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Great coffee, a nice selection of craft beer on tap and very relaxed atmosphere.  Every time I've gone I've received really good service.  If you're a fan of craft beer or coffee then you NEED to come here!"}
{"text":"Simply the best in Phoenix proper (and one if the best in Arizona by my experience). 

Solid coffees, awesome space, a super team staff, and know-how to go with it. 

We simply ordered two V60s of the baristas choice and the excitement and passion that went into the selection and brews are the exact qualities that make the specialty coffee industry and experience so enjoyable. 

Thanks Cartel!"}
{"text":"My wife had the cappuccino and I had a local beer by Fate Brewing.  My wife drinks a lot of cappuccinos and she said this was the best she has ever had and the barista made sure every thing was done right.  This place is quality.  They also have an outside seating area.  Great coffee, beer, service, and overall ambiance. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you want be told how to drink your coffee, this is the place for you.  I love the fact that they roast their own coffees, etc.  Great.  But three things frustrated me...

1.  My pregnant friend wanted a decaf Americano with a half of a shot of espresso.  The baristra refused to make that.  When we asked why, we were told \"because it would ruin the taste.\"  So, although the customer wanted it that way, they refused to make it.  We were told it had to be entirely caffeinated or decaffeinated.

2.  There is no sugar or sugar substitutes anywhere in the place.  After they refused to make my friend her drink, I didn't want to ask about the sugar and get a lecture about why I could not have any to put into my coffee.

3.  They have very nice looking, giant cookies.  And the cookies tasted great.  But it was still raw in the middle.  Kinda crappy when it costs over $2.

I got an iced coffee, which was good...less bitter than normal iced coffees.  But between the rap music blasting (not the most soothing coffee shop choice, but does work with the name of the shop) and the lack of \"give the customer what the customer wants\" attitude, I think I won't be going to this place again.  

I love suggestions about how to enjoy, drink, and appreciate my coffee.  But if I want to ruin my coffee, let me do it."}
{"text":"Quality coffee and espresso in a funky and unique atmosphere.  The staff on the espresso machines are always top notch here.  The results show in the espresso.  There is no question that the training of the baristas is superb as is their respective dedication to their craft.  There is time involved in quality so be prepared to wait, but the wait is worth it.  I also love the \"green\" decor and raging originality of the location.  Now there is also beer!!! Can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"I love this place and always come by when I'm in Tempe! Reminds me of a lot of the great coffee roasters we have in LA. They roast all of their own beans and the whole cafe smells like freshly roasted beans, added bonus of watching the roasters do their thing while you enjoy your cup. They have a display of several single-origin choices (including one decaf). What I love most about this place is you can choose your method of brew (which determines size and price). Chemex pour over, aeropress, hario drip, or clever. Pretty awesome. I'm going to pick up a bag to take home too. I prefer the Scottsdale location because this one is too close to ASU which means lots of students."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee. Great atmosphere. Try Cartel Coffee Lab over Starbucks."}
{"text":"The coffee is great but the service was horrendous. Couldn't keep up with orders and had a bad attitude with the customers. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere and friendliness. I loved the smell and the vibe. I am an espresso drinker and this is the wrong place to get a great Italian espresso. I am sure a pour over or Chrmex coffee is amazing but wrong place for an espresso."}
{"text":"The coffee is great but the service is TERRIBLE! Waited 25 minutes as 4th in line because the barista is chatting to his peeps and going slower than a slug in ice. The counter crew needs to lose the attitude and realize good service is what keeps customers. 
There are other great coffee shops like Lux and Drip in Phoenix. I will not go back to Cartel."}
{"text":"Way different than regular coffee chains. Not so often, you see a coffee shop having options to choose a process. Had a sumatra coffee in chemex for under 4$. Excellent brew, great price. Located in C gates section."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better coffee shops around the area. I got their cappuccino which was very smooth and rich, and my friends really seemed to enjoy the hot chocolate as well.  Their americano was very strong, which is the way I like mine.  I love that they play a variety of music and don't stick to just one genre, and the decor is vintage yet modern.  It's a nice place to go by yourself to study, or with friends for a chat.  The owner is very friendly- we discussed whether a zebra-donkey is called a zonkey or a debra. I only wish that this place was open longer!"}
{"text":"I visit this location basically every week day for coffee.  I get iced toddy, and am basically addicted.  Best coffee in town.  I buy cartel beans as well for camping and similar adventures, and the hot coffee is the best around.  Pastries are fantastic, staff is always friendly and the same day after day (I like familiarity!).

I ate there for the first time today, and as expected, the food was excellent."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. They sell espresso, aeropress coffe and tea snd have several locations across Arizona. Never had a better cup since coming to the US. Their coffee comes from small family farms in Guatemala, El Salvador, Mexico and Ethiopia and is not over-roasted. They also sell pastries made with real butter from the Public Market Cafe. I just wish they could come to Bay Area:-)"}
{"text":"If you want to have the best coffee in the Valley, come here. I've been going here for years. My favorite drink here is horchata with a shot of espresso-it's to die for. When ordering it be sure to call it by it's appropriate name \"the dirty-hore\".  These guys go straight to the source for their beans and ends up being better for the farmers than Fair Trade standards. Not only that but if you get lucky, you might be able to chat with the kid that roasts the beans in house, he's super knowledgable and it's a very exact science. This place is great for studying or any romantic date. Don't miss the attention to detail in the foam design on their hot drinks, they made me a fern shape one time!"}
{"text":"Great tasting coffee, and awesome prices!

I get my growlers filled with their cold brew and 
the prices are unbeatable for the quality of coffee. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome college coffee shop to check out here in Tempe. Just to much was going on here for me to study, but a wonderful place to grab a cup of quality and enjoy a good conversation."}
{"text":"A very cool place to have an above average cafe latte in an original setup and decor. This is a lovely place with almost entirely university students crowd. Love it!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of cartel but the fact that this one is not usually as packed as the other location (in Tempe) makes it even sweeter! 
I don't do dairy so I'm usually worried when it comes to snazzy drinks but here, they more than meet expectations! I came in with an open mind after biking half the greenbelt last week- pretty much just wanted something cold and tasty- and sort of meekly asked for any suggestions that would fit the \"but, yeah, um... no dairy, hahaha...thank you, sorry\" (I'm pretty much the awkward penguin meme) criteria, and the barista suggested an iced chai latte with soymilk.
And then the fireworks happened. Every person who enjoys chai.... this is by far one of the best I've ever had. It's nice and smooth with just the right amount of that black tea/spice nirvana. Yum!!!
Came back today for another one and they remembered me! It's kind of silly, but I was like, yes! That was me thank you! :) I always appreciate when they do that.
Oh, just in case anyone was curious- I picked my hetero life mate up a regular one - w/milk (and he is a big ol' coffee snob) and he loved it!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best cup of coffee I've ever had!
Tastes are subjective.
When you travel 120 days a year, and you're only halfway through an 8 day trip, and you're tired and smelly from rushing to the airport after you've overslept, and you really don't want Starbucks coffee, you will want to go to Cartel. The staff is knowledgable & friendly. Compared to other Cartels or similar specialty coffee shops, you will find good coffee. Compared to other options in the PHX airport, you will find the best cup of coffee you you've ever had.
Tastes are subjective."}
{"text":"The coffee alone is really great. If you run in and out if only for a black coffee or toddy, you will not be disappointed! I have even bought their beans from time to time. The reasons I did not give a full five stars are: strict one hour parking, never receiving a proper dry cappuccino when ordered (always latte amounts of foam, lots of milk), and the ambiance is a little too sterile for my taste - what ever happened to the cozy coffee houses of the 90's?"}
{"text":"We walked(actually ran) across Sky Harbor Airport to get coffee before our flight  It was well worth the effort  Great shop and staff  Great coffee  I have traveled everywhere in search of great coffee.  I was on the tail end of a CA trip  I had espresso in my luggage from Blue Bottle, Handsome, Intelligensia, Luxxe Verve and Sight Glass.  I added a bag of Cartel as well :)  I'll see you for sure on my next visit  Thanks for upping the ante for coffee"}
{"text":"This is going to sound funny from a non coffee drinker but I go here for something else: the What's a burrito- breakfast burrito. Seems random that a coffee shop should make such obscenely yummy burritos but Cartel downtown does. I will get veggie or with sausage or bacon. I think the difference is the ingredients are really fresh and they put spinach, potatoes, cheese and pico in it. Yum! Most joints don't put spinach in their burritos. I also like the GBY I think it's called granola, berries yogurt. Really good. The vibe is also cool though the seats are uncomfortable so don't go their to work for long periods of time. Also no bike racks boo.

But get the burrito!"}
{"text":"The coffee is decent, the atmosphere is just about right. But damn it's loud in there. A little sketched out by the bird feathers and thick layer of dust all over the seemingly active roasting equipment.... extra flavor?"}
{"text":"What can I say? This is just an awesome place. It's pretty rare to find a good coffee shop in Scottsdale, but Cartel goes above and beyond. Extremely knowledgable baristas, high quality coffee, excellent atmosphere, great location... the list goes on.

I used to head to the Tempe location whenever I wanted a serious cappuccino, but now I can get that at the Scottsdale location without wading through a sea of argyle-sweatered, wayfarer-ladened, vegan hipsters.

Thanks Nate, Skyler, James, Kris and Sparky for making this an awesome office-away-from-office for me.

P.S. - Nursing student w/ the earplugs who enjoys a nice cab with her Saturday night study sessions.... where did you go?"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Sky Harbor. 
Quick, great service, perfect temp, and goddam delicious. 

Sweet coffee bro!"}
{"text":"I love Cartel. I work within 1 mile of Cartel, so I stop in there probably 2-3 times per week on average. The staff is always very friendly, even when they are slammed with customers. Sometimes the order line gets a bit backed up, but it because Cartel takes the time to make good coffee. I highly recommend Cartel for coffee lovers."}
{"text":"I lived in the neighborhood in 2009 when Cartel opened and I was a loyal customer for the 3-4 years I lived in the area. The owners have done a great job of expanding the business and staff takes great pride in their work and the quality of the product. Unfortunately, they have changed their roasting methods over the past few years enough that it often tastes like soy sauce. I rarely get coffee here anymore."}
{"text":"Terrible service!! Don't mine waiting but this was ridiculous today.. Watched the so called barista make and throw away 4 shots for drinks then 2 lattes before he finally had help from a girl. So slow and wasteful !! If your training some one do it at another time of day. Probably won't be back. Always come here when in town. Can't remove the 1 star, not deserving!"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful, and it's a tidy, well-kept shop. My latte was good, but not quite a five-star."}
{"text":"I recently spent 3 days in downtown Phoenix, and the stop at the Cartel Coffee every morning was the highlight of my stay.  It was a great way to start the day.  The coffee and pastries are really good, the space is very cool, and the people who work there are really friendly."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, tasty coffee, very unique and good for meeting friends.  A little loud for studying or reading, for my taste."}
{"text":"Décor charming yet modern. Atmosphere best described as chill. Register is an iPad so no paper used for receipts. Drinks served in glass so no waste there. The iced mocha was delicious and had a light and slightly creamy taste. Friends got an agave latte and a hot coffee. Both approved."}
{"text":"best fancy coffee i've had so far in this town.  they roast their own, which is nice and they seem to take drink making pretty seriously.  their soy macciato makes my day.  

and you don't actually have to be a hipster to buy coffee here, so shake it off."}
{"text":"From 5 stars to 1 star.
Talk about a 180.
I was so looking forward to grabbing a cup when I landed.
I'm talking this place up to my coworker as we're flying in.
He's excited.
I'm excited.
Then we're met at the counter by some gentlemen who seems to take great pride in telling us what we can't order in a to go cup.
My coworker just shakes his head & walks off.
I finally settle on a latte.
And I wait & wait & wait.
Finally they realize that someone literally walked off with my drink.
One would think they would just make me a new cup.
Nope.
They had to discuss it & figure it out.
I tell me coworker let's go.
Yes, I paid, tipped & never received my drink.
The owners need to address this customer service issue."}
{"text":"The iced chai with espresso is pretty good. Nice open layout with minimal/interesting decor, but there was strange nature-ish music playing over the speakers. Might grab a chai if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Cool looking place, but pricey drinks.  Zucchini bread was delicious.  Iced mocha was just okay."}
{"text":"My favorite place to treat myself of all the places and choices for coffee to go to is CARTEL. I don't always get to venture out because it's about 25 miles away from me but in the end it's worth it because it's about the best coffee I ever tasted.  With that being said, before making this review I read some of the past reviews and realized I wasn't crazy! One of the gals there just Rude not just rude but in a Condescending way. I mean that's bad when you don't even want to go back to your favorite coffee joint! How does that even work? Guy that grounds my coffee-super nice, gal that takes our order @ 10:05(mind you they close at 10) super nice and patient with us. Gal who locked the door- well I think she was from another planet the way she treated me. Manners anyone??? I'm sorry but customer service is key not matter what! That is .... if you want to keep your clientele. SMH"}
{"text":"Where should I start. Bad on every level, bitter coffee served by snarky,bitter hipsters with incredible chips on their shoulders. If I could give no stars I would. They won't last long. Don't waste your time or money, walk over to Starbucks and get treated like a person."}
{"text":"I bought a boxed tuna salad from this place. When I got to my terminal and tasted it, I was stunned. This was the best airport food I've ever experienced, so good that I wish I had also bought coffee there when I had the chance. Also so good that I have visited their yelp page a few times just to read reviews and reminisce, even though this place is in Phoenix, and I live in L.A.  I even created a yelp account so I could share the love."}
{"text":"They do coffee right; no complaints with my small latte. You can taste the freshly roasted beans. They have some tempting baked goods brought in from their downtown location. I loved the zucchini- goat cheese scone with a sprinkle of sea salt on top. Yum!"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop is Lux in Phoenix. Cartel is a decent alternative, but the vibe isn't as great as Lux."}
{"text":"Cartel is the best coffee spot in Phoenix hands down. It is almost always busy and does take a while because the baristas take their time to make each drink with care and expertise. The whole staff is knowledgable and very nice.  The mocha is my favorite. It is not too sugary or sweet the espresso has great flavor and acid. It is my favorite coffee by far must go!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice with a friend of mine. It is quite yummy. My first trip I had a coffee mocha and it was rich and strong. But I did not think it was better than my Bialetti at home. The second time I went in, I had something like a mocha, but it had chocolate in it. My friend ordered so I don't exactly know what it was. That drink absolutely blew me away. Wow. I even shouted how great it was while I was drinking it. So amazing."}
{"text":"Great coffee, if a little pricey..Staff is usually pretty friendly. Definitely a hipster coffee shop; not necessarily a bad thing, but if that's an issue you should probably steer clear."}
{"text":"Yeah baby, this place is so rad. love all the coffee drinks and fun decor. it is the real deal, not like the phony expensive place that rhymes with farbucks and is filled with socialists."}
{"text":"Have been here before with ok experience. Such a scene that it takes over the coffee experience. But that is beside the point of today's post. Wanted to give cartel another chance after being featured in the AZ Republic. Cartel stated that they were excited about their new beer offerings and we were excited to give them a shot. They wanted to be a place for the neighbourhood to hang out. What a bunch of bull!

Enter in the place at about 8:30 pm on a Saturday night. It's pretty dead and the beer bar was a wasteland. Sat and waited. And waited. And waited. Did I mention that it was a wastlenad. Finally the boy at the counter ( after having a five minute discussion about green drinks) poured a beer for someone.  He forcefully attempted to avoid making eye contact with us. We asked him if this is where we order beer, he said \"You Caaan\", in the most put out sarcastic way.  He then went back to pouring 4 beers down the drain because he couldn't figure out how to pour a beer that wasn't all head.

His overly pretentious attitude, and obvious attempt to ignore us made us believe we were not welcome.  Maybe we don't fit their desired demographic. We thought that all people were welcomed . We were wrong. In fact, two gentleman that came in after us and just wanted a beer, left without being acknowledged.

This is extremely disappointing. Tempe has the unique opportunity to have amazing independent establishments that welcome the diversity that make Tempe a place for everyone. Cartel Coffee does not hold the spirit of that. There are many other coffee and beer places that will greet you with a smile, serve you a beverage, and be kind. This is not one of them.
Four Peaks, Spokes on Southern, eXtreme Bean, and Gold Bar are places that embrace Tempe and the diversity it has to offer. Please let these places have your business!"}
{"text":"Great concept, workers seem inefficient and when you order a pour over it's only luke warm.  Evidently they are unable to offer the \"Pasquale\" , the Colombian coffee in anything other than a pour over sigh....."}
{"text":"When I landed in Phoenix, I noticed there was a Cartel in my terminal so I wanted to check it out right away. I've been to a couple of their other locations and always loved it. Here is no exception, excellent coffee! It's refreshing to be in an airport and be able to have a cappuccino done right. (Makes me want to have all my future stops in terminal 4 haha:) )"}
{"text":"very interesting interior
great latte, not too much foam
amazing coffee selection"}
{"text":"Would always stop in between classes. Sometimes on lunch break. Coffee is good. Can get crowded at times, but service is still quick. Internet can be hit or miss, depending on the signal. But still free wifi."}
{"text":"Amidst the often burnt and always over-caffeinated Starbucks brew on every other street corner, Cartel Coffee Lab is a true coffee enthusiast's oasis. Cartel is, above all, dedicated to the quality and integrity of coffee. As much as I frequent other coffee shops for their ambience or convenience, this is the only place I'll go if I truly want an excellent cup of coffee, roasted and brewed under one roof.

Random tidbits of information for newbies:

---This is not the place to go if you need a speedy cup of coffee during your three-and-a-half-minute window before work. The beans for every cup of coffee are ground and drip brewed as you order, so you'll have to allow yourself a few minutes of anticipation. I would not recommend large groups of people either, as I believe there are only 4-5 brewing stations that can be used simultaneously. 
---Dark roasts are not served here, just light to medium.
---Fun fact: Darker roasts actually contain less caffeine than lighter roasts - not that you should interrupt your drinking pleasure with those kinds of thoughts...
---Cartel sells their own freshly roasted beans. It's pricey (somewhere around $15-20 for 3/4 lb), but you get what you pay for!
---Some eyebrows may be raised if you try to fluff up their drinks too much (fortunately the coffee is fantastic without the aid of double-shot-mocha-sugar-syrup potions).
---Cappuccinos will be enjoyed in house, in their proper glasses. They will not be put in \"to-go\" cups.
---Yes, there is free wi-fi for paying customers.
---They usually, though not always, have some yummy pastries...if you need something more substantial, please see below:
---Right across the parking lot is a great mom-and-pop pizza place called Otto's. Convenient for a limited lunch break! Also next to Buffalo Clothing Exchange, if want to make a day out of it...

Why only four stars, you ask? The general ambience of the place is a little too industrial for my taste, and in the past there have been some less than pleasant baristas. I'm happy to report, however, that in my last few visits I was served by wonderful people that were kind and helpful.

Keep it up, Cartel!"}
{"text":"Wow such terrible service! Walked in with my in-laws to get a quick cup of coffee after a nice dinner. The barista completely ignored us for a solid 5 minutes even as we stood there ready to order $20 worth of caffeine. He clearly saw us and chose not to engage, saw us and failed to even acknowledge our presence.   I have never been completely ignored like this. We waited for 5 minutes and walked out. Not a word from the barista.  What a complete disappointment, don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here... Not even worth the free wifi.

1) Coffee is mediocre and overpriced... $3.75 for a drip coffee? Really? 
2) Employees are pretentious, too much attitude for a job a donkey can do. 
3) Dirty dirty dirty! Employees must be too busy smelling their own farts to wipe down tables and chairs, or clean the bathroom, or sweep the floors. 
4) It's an ideal place for homeless looking folks that link their identity with the coffee they build their debt on (These are the people that rate this place more than 1 star)... 5) Also a good place for douche bags that talk loud enough for everyone to know what they're selling. 

Find another place to get your drug... 

Cartel... is a sell out."}
{"text":"I had a connecting flight in this terminal as I was coming back from a funeral a month ago. Needless to say I was exhausted. The service I got here was wonderful and personal. I didn't know what I wanted, but the barista, Colin, took the time to help me figure their menu out.
The quality of the drink I got (a chai latte) was beautiful. The foam was delicious and creamy - just like it should be!

I then sat at the bar there and did homework while listening to the music that they had chosen. It was like sitting at a REAL artisan coffee shop!

I had the munchies so I got two cookies: the molasses cookie and the cowgirl cookie. They were both absolutely delicious: moist, huge, full of flavor and basically exactly like a cookie should be.

Their coffee knowledge is fantastic. Angela (or was it Angelica?) was able to describe the flavors of the roasts fantastically. I bought a pound and was given a free iced coffee as a result - which was SOOO GOOD! I normally load up my coffee with sugar and milk, but the quality (and wonderful flavors) made that unnecessary. 

Needless to say, the service, atmosphere, and product quality restored a sense of humanity to a place that often seems impersonal, sterile, and rushed."}
{"text":"$3.75 for a 16 ounce coffee which was the worst coffee I've had in quite a while. It had the acidic taste of a coffee that has been kept at too hot a temperature for too long."}
{"text":"Good coffee, but low throughput. It took 20 minutes for my group of 3 to get our coffees. Pourover station was limited to one coffee at a time - 2 to 4 is standard elsewhere. Espresso was good but a little thin bodied; Santa Clara Gesha was likewise tasty but perhaps hard to justify at $10 per cup. 

Maybe a good place to hang out, but slower than I was expecting for a midday coffee."}
{"text":"Non existent customer service but coffee is okay and decently priced, not the best ever but I like they're menu."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm someone who usually has a hard time finding a public place where I can sit and feel like I'm actually alone. I don't know how this place pulls it off, but it does. The service. The beer/coffee/tea menu. The music. The environment. It's all great. It's big enough to not feel crowded, but small enough to hold onto that corner coffee shop feel. Great for reading, writing, studying, or just cooling off. If you haven't been. Go."}
{"text":"Alright, coffee is five stars. I am taking two stars off for one reason: a customer is not allowed to get 'cappuccino breve' to go. This is extremely irritating as I do not want the two extra ounces of half and half in the latte which is the suggested to go alternative. I realize they want this as a signature drink only served in a small, pretentious, cup. Love it. Find a small, pretentious, to go cup. 

I give this place five stars for service.

I take of the two for this irritating situation."}
{"text":"I supported this great little shop from the get go when they just barely opened their doors. But last time I visited, some snotty little barista didn't leave room as I had asked. When I asked her to pour some of it out, the response was, \"Can't you just drink it down\"?  Guess what, if I liked to drink my beverage WITHOUT milk/half and half........I really never would have bothered to ask for room now, would i? Oh.....and then I asked for a napkin to wipe up a small spill they acted like I was chopping down a forest. Good luck to the owners, who seemed like nice people.......but isn't it possible to hire less snotty help?"}
{"text":"Love their new layout!! Talked to the barista making my drink,super nice guy and love the machine he was working on. Had a pour-over and enjoyed it as well the super cool to go cups!! Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"OMG if you are in scottsdale and love good coffee,  got to try this place !! The cappuccino was amazing !! The gingerbread cake was fresh and tasty !"}
{"text":"I admit, the name drew me in. When i travel i try these local coffee hangouts and am usually pleased. 
Im undecided about cartel. 
One, it was not laid back as i thought it would be. However, from what i read this is the go-to hangout for Arizona state students. It was a bit too busy for me and not enough tables. Students took up a whole 4 seat table with just books. But again, this is to be expected since its so close to the college. 

Coffee : im a coffee junkie but this one didn't do it for me. 

Before you leave: grab a sharpie and tag the bathroom wall, lol. It was covered with sayings, quotes and a few explatives. 

Moral of the story : it wasn't my cup of tea.."}
{"text":"Cartel has the best coffee in Phoenix.  Full stop.  If you care at all about coffee, you MUST go.  Everytime I've been the coffee has been amazing and the preparation excellent.  Owners are great, prices very reasonable, what could go wrong?  Just try it and it you'll see."}
{"text":"Never was a bid coffee drinker till this place. I always drank energy drinks till I was exposed to their cold brew coffee. GAME CHANGER!"}
{"text":"The perfection, except when I think a new barista girl make my lovely late, the foam was sadly bubbling and the coffee lake of body and flavor... any other day with any barista guy are perfect."}
{"text":"I just had an apple tart and the crust was perfect! Home made for sure!"}
{"text":"I would like to preface this with one statement: my love of Cartel is ferocious. 

I am at the HTC Body Piercing around the corner semi-often and every time I somehow end up at Cartel, waiting patiently for my regular order of a large iced Chai soy latte. It tastes like there's a wee dance party taking place on my tongue. I've ordered the same thing many a time at many a cafe and no one's is as delicious. I've never had a problem with the wait or the staff, they're always beyond polite and are almost always hilarious. Or at least act like I am, which will get one far. I love that they roast their own beans, take the time to help me decide whether or not to mix up my order, and that I always leave caffinated and with a smile."}
{"text":"Usually the place is packed whenever I go there, but the chai tea latte is worth it. Has a great vibe as well and the best of all: FREE WIFI!"}
{"text":"I had been anticipating my visit for some time now & I finally made it! Wonderful spot & I look forward to coming back when in town & enjoying my cold brew there!

Like:
Cold brew - Kenya...soft but tasty!
Service
Ambiance - Love the 'lab' concept...burlap coffee sacks off to the side on the floor. Local art on the walls...truly feels like a neighborhood hang out

Wish:
Open one in Riverside or the Inland Empire area of CA!"}
{"text":"There's no question about it - Cartel is currently the best coffeehouse in Phoenix. 

For those of you serious about your coffee, Cartel doesn't disappoint. They roast their own beans from coffee plantations they've visited personally, and consistently pull the best espresso shots I've encountered in the Valley. LUX and Lola's, in comparison, are sorrowfully hit-or-miss, and other neighborhood coffeeshops like Coffee Rush, Bunna, Three Roots, Extreme Bean, Solo Cafe, and Gold Bar don't even make the cut. (Though if you're still frequenting your local Starbucks, do yourself a big favor and try out ANY independent coffeeshop in your area; you'll get the same quality or better and generally more bang for your buck.) I've been to some of the best coffeehouses in NYC and Seattle, and Cartel ranks right up there with them.

The owners and baristas are fantastic; there's no pretension here. The lighting can be a bit dim, but I've studied and read comfortably in just about every corner of the place. If you're using a laptop, outlets are near the couches but relatively accessible from two of the larger communal tables. You may encounter a lot of artsy student types, but we don't bite.

Coffee alternatives: Cartel brews more-than-decent tea, and makes a good cuppa hot chocolate (though you'd be better off getting the honey dark chocolate mocha, imho). Their chai isn't bad, though I secretly wish they'd brew the tea from their own spices, as LUX does. I haven't asked, but you can probably get the espresso excelente without espresso, which would mean you'd be drinking horchata (a heavenly Mexican cinnamon-rice milk concoction).

Cartel is a gem. Better coffee than anywhere else in the Valley but they don't let it go to their head."}
{"text":"small simple coffee house, but they also serve beer it seems. My coffee was wonderful (small quad vanilla latte) you would think it would be too strong but whatever espresso they use is great! no bitterness. and the red head gal who helped me was very nice. I will go back!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and even better service. My first visit they were nice enough to allow me to try all the different cold Brews. All of them were so amazing that it made my selection more difficult. The atmosphere is great just a little too small as it tends to be very busy and gets very crowded."}
{"text":"Great place for coffee but the microbrews are really great too!! Excellent atmosphere.  Friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Walked all the way over from A gates for this. Indicates it was open till 21:00. Was closed as of 19:30. Please update your hours."}
{"text":"Best coffee in downtown PHX. The barisas are great folks."}
{"text":"I don't have a single complaint about this coffee shop! The cold brew coffee is fantastic, the employees are amazing, and the location is in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale!  I grab a cold brew coffee almost every day before work, which is reasonably priced.  I do, occasionally, have to park down the street, but the it is definitely worth the walk!  I have bought beans from them to brew on the weekends, which is almost just as good as when they make it."}
{"text":"Was headed to the usual Starbucks when I saw this place. Wow! Great coffee, great service and what a HUGE difference from the Starbucks experience! If your not running to your next gate, it's worth the trip to the C gate area! Great job Ryan and Jesse!\""}
{"text":"Some of the nicest coffee to match some of the nicest atmosphere I've experienced at a shop like this. The experience is only amplified by the friendly folk they employ."}
{"text":"I buy beans here every other week, and I usually get a latte while I'm there. Their espresso is excellent, but don't order brewed coffee -- I made that mistake once and ended up with a cup full of grounds. I rarely stay too long because I hate the atmosphere. The music is way too loud and the clientele are mostly pretentious hipsters. Also, the baristas lack intelligence, but they can make a killer latte. So, alas, I am sure I will return."}
{"text":"I love their oolong tea, the light one. What I love the most is working on my projects here, 'cuz they have free wifi and many plugs! They have indoor and outdoor area. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and saw a coffee shop, so I stopped by for a quick cup. Well, that was difficult. I wish I had beforehand seen all of the fake 4/5-star reviews here and headed elsewhere.

In short:
Everything will likely be broken.
You're not allowed to make any changes to your beverage, because the place is run by a bunch of pretentious ninnies who believe their product is the epitome of.. whatever it is that they are attempting to do (the word \"swindle\" comes to mind).
Oh, and the end result will be mediocre.

Head elsewhere. Do not be swayed by their interesting-looking wooden sign. The inner design is nice, however. If you hate coffee, enjoy the atmosphere of pompous hipster foolery, and just want to hang out inside with a friend or two, this may be the place for you."}
{"text":"By far the best coffee around. Lots of coffee shops are run by snobs, but the baristas here will gladly take time to answer any questions or take custom orders."}
{"text":"Cartel's coffee is quickly popping up all over the valley and I love it! The ambiance at this downtown location is somewhat industrial/structural, with lots of concrete surfaces, wood structure and few soft points. The staff is extremely knowledgeable, at times coming off snobbish about their coffee. I love this trait because while I love coffee, I don't know a ton about how it's made or what method of brewing renders the best flavor out of a given bean. And here at Cartel, that's ok! I simply ask, and the staff tells me which method is good for the bean I've chosen, and thus they render a fantastic cup of coffee each and every time. I'm never disappointed in the product at Cartel."}
{"text":"So awesome that there is a great coffee shop in the airport. These people know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"Solid coffee shop, even better considering it is in an airport. Pour over was well made, nice selection of beans, and timely for the quality (5-6 min)."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews, I realized the poor/rude attitudes is a staple with this place.  Walked in, was not greeted at all.  I just got a look like, \"are you gonna order?\"  Seriously, you are just a coffee barista!! Don't act like you have earned your PhD to work there.....MMMk?...so i ordered two different coffees.  You'd think that the person making the coffee would specify the difference between the two coffees.  What has happened to common sense?....He set them on the counter with no lids and ran off!......I had never been there before, I didn't know the lids were to the side as well as the liquid sweetener and for a \"hip, trendy\" place, you serve Splenda!?!  Didn't even get a \"thanks, have a nice day\"....and they have the nerve to ask for a tip... LOL, ya ok. 

I think establishments forget that tips are earned NOT expected.  TIP=GOOD to exceptional service.  Plus - the coffee is not great, will NOT ever return!"}
{"text":"Great concept, great service, and amazing coffee. Outdoor patio provides a lounge like experience while the inside has a very humble coffee bar ambiance. Great place to relax and enjoy a drink, now offering beer/wine also."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee places I've been to.  My first toddy was here at cartel and I fell in love with toddies. I love the atmosphere. You can sit and catch up with a friend or get work done. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Apparently, I am in the minority with my opinion of this place.  While the coffee is good, it shouldn't take 20 minutes to process my order.  I don't care if they are personally flying to Columbia right after I order to hand pick the beans right before they make it...20 minutes is unacceptable. 

And then when I place my order, I shouldn't be insulted by the guy making it.  Yes, I asked for non-fat milk.  I didn't ask you to put Ketchup in my drink, I asked for non-fat milk.  Don't treat me like I am mentally challenged.  I weigh 165lbs, do you really think I order non-fat because I am concerned with my weight?  No business should EVER ask a customer what the point of their order is the way this dude asked me.  

I want to like this place, I do.  The atmosphere and location were great, and the hot tattooed blond sitting at the counter was fun to flirt with (I think she could tell the guy annoyed me).  So for this, I will give it another shot.  A lot of the people I know rave about this place.  Maybe I just hit it on an off day.  If I get the same attitude the next time, I might drop trough mid store."}
{"text":"Good variety and rotation of coffee.  Great options.  Good location.  You're average hip coffee shop with a more industrial feel."}
{"text":"Coffee is fantastic, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. There's just a general apathy on the part of the employees, I've noticed."}
{"text":"High on their horse. Its \"our policy\" to not allow you to have shots of espresso over ice. You HAVE to have an americano.   Are you kidding me? The other person in my flight crew ended up just getting a few shots of espresso, and it was a big ordeal and tasted horrible.  \"good luck\" was the reply when I mentioned going somewhere else. As a flight crew member, we come through this airport ALL the time. Good way for word to travel fast about you is to give flight crew crummy service. We both received attitude. All we wanted was a simple order.. bummer.. was excited about the \"something different\" factor!"}
{"text":"THE PROBLEM: coffee is not strong. Not enough caffeine. I wish if they have more options for hot coffee instead of offering cold coffee."}
{"text":"this is a very good coffee place.

I like the feel of the place. It's very authentic. The owner is not trying to hard to create a certain image like Lux coffee downtown. 

It's a simple place with a limited menu. The coffee is outstanding. The maple scone was very fresh, excellent.

My only complaint is the small cups they serve the coffee in. I prefer a larger mug but no big deal. 

It's small but I've never had a problem getting a seat and staying. the wifi is fast too."}
{"text":"I just love everything they serve....
They have great coffee, beer, and wines, also the store's atmosphere!!!
Very relaxing and I always can concentrate on my desk work there...!!!

This is the place I go even I live in Mesa!!!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop with an outstanding breakfast burrito as well. If you like \"real coffee\" made by baristas then this is your place."}
{"text":"The employees here are cool as heck!  We came here after going to Comedy Live at like 9pm and no one was there, an hour before closing and not only did we get a nice cup of joe, we got to know another decent human being.  

Sean was the manager that night and he was way cool...I think his name was Sean...and if it isn't then I know he is cool enough to forgive me. 

I got their Chai, it was great.  I won't hold it against them that the their menu called it Chai Tea, which is redundant because in Hindi Chai means tea.  So we are calling it \"Tea Tea\"  Now you made me say something dirty.  Haha, get it \"Tea Tea\" Don't judge me."}
{"text":"Really slow service and the Americano and latte we ended up with were terrible. I was able to add syrup to my latte to cover up the taste and the fact that the vanilla was left out. The Americano couldn't be saved because the beans were burned. I would not recommend this place. It's an overhyped, overrated hipster coffee joint with bad coffee."}
{"text":"Best shop downtown. Better than your average. Latte art was a little rough, but the barista did a great job steaming the milk. My cortado was served at the right temp which few shops get right. I could actually hold the glass in my hand. The espresso held up to the milk really well and didn't get lost. Always a safe choice when looking for specialty coffee."}
{"text":"I don't want to be a hater or some typical impatient new yorker, but how this place gets such great reviews and remains open is baffling to me. First I gotta say the girl with the bangs was super nice and really cool. My complaint here is that we were on the road and stopped in here to support local coffee shops and wanted a coffee and a quick bite. My buddy got his latte within 5 mins and he was happy. I just ordered a plain black coffee and I'm not exaggerating, I waited 25 mins to get it. I get that they're crafting me a nice cup of Joe and all but 25 mins is nuts. How do they do business in the morning rush?? And not to pile on,  but we ordered a hummus sandwich and a egg and ham sandwich and that took 30 mins to make! They weren't even packed, they were just moving that slow. Forgive me if I'm being too impatient but that is way too long to be waiting for a plain coffee and a sandwich."}
{"text":"Airport coffee is usually an iffy proposition. Cartel Coffee breaks away from the pack with great coffee people and some of the best coffee I've tasted in a long time."}
{"text":"Only place in all the greater Phoenix area I would come for a macchiato...I'd drive miles for it (And I did)"}
{"text":"Surprising find in PHX. Good espresso/cappuccino served by appropriately mustachioed hipster barista. Go to C terminal for coffee!"}
{"text":"I had one of the worst customer service experiences ever at Cartel coffee lab! I went to Cartel coffee lab for the first time ever on a tuesday morning around 8:15am.
I walked in to Cartel coffee lab and there was one person in line ahead of me, and maybe 5 other people total in the establishment (appearing that they already had been served). Once the person in front of me had been taken care of, I stepped forward to the counter, and none of the Cartel coffee lab employees even acknowledged that I was even standing there. This went on for about 2 long weird minutes, waiting to have my order taken when I'm the only one in line. There were three Cartel coffee lab employees in the coffee making area, and yet not one of them even bothered to take my order or even say I'll be right with you or anything.
The Cartel coffee lab employee who served the person in front of me actually began a conversation with one of the other employees right in front of me, and still didn't acknowledge me at all.

I usually don't write reviews and such, because I believe that if I receive sub standard service anywhere (Cartel coffee lab) I will just divert my business elsewhere and never go back. I also believe that there is a par line, and when businesses fail to meet even below average service standards (Cartel coffee lab), 
they should be BLOWN UP ON YELP(Cartel coffee lab)!!!

The saddest part about this is that I never got to try ANYTHING from Cartel coffee lab, and unless someone buys me a to go cup from there, I will never attempt to give Cartel coffee lab my business again!"}
{"text":"I really want to rave about Cartel. They have great coffee. The barristas really know what they are doing. I love being able to try the same beans in different brewing methods executed by experts. The food is great (they have the best breakfast burrito in downtown). The space is never loud.

Having said all that, why is this not a 5 star review?

Every time I come in here, I feel like I shouldn't. I feel like the barristas are judging me. I feel like I'm bothering them by not having asymmetrical hair and riding a fixie.

I don't like that I have to ask to get the wi-fi password. I don't like that over half the available seating space is taken up by a low-hanging chandelier and what may or may not be an art installation (the concrete blocks in front appear to be seats). I don't like that they moved into a bigger space and seem to have fewer tables. I don't like that you can't see the menu until you walk up to the register and the barrista is breathing down your neck waiting for you to order. I don't like that I've been in there five times in the last two weeks and they still treat my like I'm someone in town for a convention (which is something that happens at a lot of downtown businesses).

Overall, if you want an exceptionally well-made cup of coffee in downtown, this is the place. If you want to enjoy the experience, however ... maybe go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This isn't even my terminal. I went out of my way to come get a pour over! This is now a good day"}
{"text":"Waaaaay better than your average Americano or other espresso drink. I have only been a few times because parking in old town scottsdale can be annoying, but will definitely try to make more of an effort to get more espresso from here!
And as a plus there are cute Hipster boys :)"}
{"text":"I just went to Cartel last night for Final Friday. It was awesome.  There were free brow nies, a cool band, nice art on the walls and a really cool crowd (including the out of place looking gangsta white boy who I later saw being cuffed and searched on Mill).  A photographer was even set up in the back working on his art project that was inclusive of anyone who wanted to participate.  

The only weird thing was the fact that my friend and I had to share a tiny sampe of their coffee-- it was pretty good though"}
{"text":"I'd much rather hit up Cartel before a flight than Starbucks. When I realized my gate was next to Cartel as I was about to go find Starbucks, I was overcome with joy. Whoever decided to put a Cartel in Sky Harbor is a genius."}
{"text":"I swung by Cartel to grab a coffee on my lunch break a few days ago, and was impressed with the operation. It is just like how I'd imagine a coffee shop, with the vibe, kind of akward build, and character that so many coffee shops lack these days (ahem cough cough Starbuckscough!). It felt strange to be in because I am so use to the \"other guys\" set-up that I've been going to for years, but I liked it...it left me wanting other experiences there. The latte I had was pretty good, hand made with care and time invested, instead of just thrown together quickly by a barista in a green apron. The 2 guys behind the counter were nice, one welcoming me back for a future visit. I thought it was cool they have a side-bar where they serve a couple different micro-brews and wine, something at least I've never seen in a coffee shop. Just an interesting place all together. I wish I could've spent some more time there but I enjoyed my brief visit. As of now, they have a new customer! The coffee, unique experience, and service equals a 4.5, obviously have to down grade to a 4. Oh and a side note...their cash register is an ipad, which is something you don't see everyday."}
{"text":"Great coffee options here, brewed to order.  Nice staff.  Hipster vibe and customer base though, which is entertaining to me.  Parking is good on weekdays.  A few draft beers available, so this is a great night hangout also."}
{"text":"Not a place I will visit again. I work in very close proximity, had tried their coffee a couple of months ago and swore I would never buy a coffee there again & I have not. On Thursday of this week I thought I would try lunch b/c I always see the place filled during the lunch rush. All I ordered was a simple grilled cheese & I was not even close to impressed.  Never again."}
{"text":"There are definitely better coffee shops in town but it certainly is not bad. I do love the eclectic decor and the staff is awesome. It is kind of strange when you have a coffee shop that actually does not have drip coffee as an option.  This place definitely caters to the college crowd."}
{"text":"Great iced coffee! Cold brewed?... Works for me."}
{"text":"The very nice baristas at Cartel took pity on my woes and gave me a FREE chemex pour. Newly-minted fan for life. Now my air travel horror story was pretty extreme, so don't go expecting freebies when you visit, but, for an airport, this is legit coffee."}
{"text":"Really good coffee, kinda strong so I'll tell em to add more cream next time. It's kinda pricy but the quality is good. Love the designs."}
{"text":"Cartel makes a great cup of coffee. A seriously GREAT cup of coffee (or latte, or espresso). The staff are helpful if you need advice about what to get, and they know their brews. I had a very interesting espresso here recently, with notes of citrus at the front and chocolate at the finish. It was...different, but still good. 

This place is always busy. Always. However, you should have no trouble finding at least one seat open to sit and enjoy that great cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Don't ask for a cappuccino or an espresso to go as you won't get one as the flavor will be destroyed in a paper cup! ( this makes completely sense!!!! - when you are in an airport - mostly in a hurry). Stop this fake  \"coffee snobbism\" attitude! This is simply unbearable."}
{"text":"Found this place while looking for a local coffee spot and it did not disappoint!! Delicious coffee that they roast on site so the place smells great. They also brew their own beer and its amazing. The workers are all passionate and you can tell they love what they do. The coffee is great without cream or sugar so try it out! And the atmosphere is chill--you can bring your dog!! Highly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Coming from Portland, I really wanted a good cup of coffee while I was in the airport. And then I saw two hipsters behind the corner, talking to themselves - probably about coffee. They greeted me with only the mildest and most appropriate amount of barista snootiness - love at first sight. They tempted me to try their coffee, which was delicious. If it had not been my second cup of the day, I likely would have had another."}
{"text":"By far my favorite coffee shop in all of Arizona! I think I have been to pretty much everyone in the valley.

This place has fueled my temptation to quit the 9-5 and do freelance out of a coffee shop all day! Nothing better than a dirty chai and an evening chilling on a chaise lounge chair! I almost lost all faith in Cartel after attending the Tempe location several times and getting bad vibes from the employees every visit. However I am glad I got over my \"cartel\" fear and checked out the old town location. This place is a 180 deg difference from the tempe location. I was greeted by a helpful, friendly staff that doesn't come off as coffee snobs, because their is nothing worse than a barista with an attitude. Keep up the friendly staff and great atmosphere and I will be a life long patron!

Plus they have a small but great selection of craft beers!

Prices are on par with all other coffee shops in the area. Wireless internet is free and consistently works well."}
{"text":"Best reason to come to Gate C13.  There is nothing that I dislike about this place - and for an airport, that's saying a lot!  Customer service is key here and everyone that I've dealt with have been friendly and helpful.  They use Square to process their credit cards and the receipt is able to be emailed or sent to you via text.  This is very helpful if you're traveling for business and need to keep track of receipts - one less thing not to worry about misplacing.  The scones are over the top good and I'd put their coffee up against any other!  I actually don't mind getting to the airport a little early knowing that I'm going to grab coffee and a scone here."}
{"text":"When I found out there was a Cartel Coffee Lab in Scottsdale I made sure I ventured out to try it as soon as possible. Which happened to be the next day. I love the location in Old Town. It's off the main street so it's a bit more quiet and has a great funky industrial feel inside. I had espresso and my husband had a hot latte. The latte was perfection, and my espresso was spot on. We also tried a couple of the pastries. I definitely recommend their cinnamon roll with cream cheese frosting(It had a hint of citrus in the frosting). Yum. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing Coffee Spot!!!  I am very picky about coffee and I strictly search for single origin beans. I only prefer to drink Single Origin, and this place only serves single origin beans so it literally felt like I was at home. This place also only serves single origin coffee directly from the specific farms the beans come from!  This means you are getting fresh, whole bean coffee that does not have any other negative influences on it. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone and everyone who enjoys a delicious cup of coffee. Whether you're new to coffee or an experienced drinker.  They also have amazing varieties of how they Brew your coffee and the prices are not bad either!!

The service was great as well. They were extremely helpful and even educational when it came to explaining what Cartel was all about.  Great place!!!!"}
{"text":"Great set up! Awesome Coffee and good vibes. This is coffee place definitely has a hipster look and atmosphere. Will definitely be coming back again. The only downside to it is that it's sort of small and can get really full during the morning rush.

Perfect expresso and iced coffee without breaking your bank account if your on a student salary."}
{"text":"Decent place, Large and spacious but the employees aren't too friendly unless they know you.  I like there coffee but because they make their coffee in this location you smell really bad when you leave.  Only a few outlets for laptops.  But better than some other Tempe coffee shops."}
{"text":"Super neat coffee spot. I'd always heard great things and decided to check it out myself. A real good space with plenty of seating and free wifi!"}
{"text":"One of the best lattes around! I wish it wasn't so crowded all the time. A cute hub with fun decor."}
{"text":"You haven't had a great cup of coffee until you have been to Cartel. The roaster and a taproom is on site."}
{"text":"The decor is a little sparse, especially at this location. I enjoyed the Tempe shop better, which was especially consistent with the 'lab' vibe. The service both here and Tempe is too laid back, but I'm not usually in a hurry when I sit down for coffee. They don't over-roast, and they date the bags, so you can buy whole beans with confidence. 

I liked the \"One & One,\" where they split the pull into a shot of straight espresso, a macchiato, and add a small glass of sparkling water to cleanse your palette. They managed to get a little creative, and it works."}
{"text":"Seriously killer hot chai latte.  The blueberry muffin I had to go with it didn't hurt my feelings either.  Several outlets available to plug in your electronic gizmos.    Would definitely make a repeat visit next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Grabbed a small latte (average priced) from Cartel this morning before class and had a pretty great experience. 

I arrived just before a small rush, so the wait was non-existent. I was unsure if they took cards, but the nice guy at the register responded cordially when I asked and after a little confusion about what size I wanted (I hate you Starbucks for ingraining tall as a size in my brain), my latte was being crafted. I do not use the term crafted flippantly, the young woman who made my latte knew what she was doing. The proportion of steamed milk to espresso was just right and the heart shaped image in the crema was immaculate. 

The only negative aspect of the experience was the shoddy bike rack I had to lock my bike to, but I'm not sure there's much the Lab can do about that.

Nice staff, nice atmosphere and great coffee. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok Cartel... I've been a regular customer for years.  I love the coffee, the tea, and the cool vibe.  But today at the Tempe location, I stayed for an hour and a half for a business meeting and came out to a \"warning\" from TEAM security on my car.  \"1 HR means 1 HR\"?!  Really?

I'll just go to literally ANY other coffee shop next time."}
{"text":"5 star coffee, easily the best coffee in the whole valley. The service has gotten much better. It used to be where the baristas were total snobs, and looked down upon you. I think maybe you need to be a hipster to get smile and good service. A paying customer who loves good coffee isn't good enough. But like I said, they are much more cordial now. I would go more often, but I don't like the dungeon dark feeling in the place. They should open that back more, add some natural light ambience. It takes forever to get your coffee, but its fresh and delicious. Coffee 5 stars, everything else, 1 to 2, Therefore a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"This place is legit!  It's nice to have a change from other typical lame coffee shops that you see in airports.  I got the \"Iced Dirty Chai Latte\", and it didn't disappoint!  If I find myself in this airport in the middle of the desert again, I'll be coming back.  Good job guys.

PS  Kinda reminds me of the Better Buzz Lab in San Diego, CA (Pacific Beach)"}
{"text":"I am really impressed with this coffee shop! I wasn't expecting to be wowed because lets face it, in downtown Phoenix you can throw a stone in any direction and run into one. Upon walking in I was immediately greeted with great decor and friendly employees. My drink was made quickly and was definitely worth the walk. I suggest trying this location if you are looking for a good alternative to your typical coffee chain."}
{"text":"Not that I would ever go to a coffee shop just to watch people...but here my friend and I kind of did. Ha! ok ok so there are alot of interesting people that come in this place. Nothing like I have ever seen atleast. Then again I am not into the college scene, so I don't know. But anyway. the coffee is super good. The cookies are amazing. This shop is definitely funky and cool. Not too cozy as far as big chairs or whatnot. So that's my only beef. But i would definitely come back to this place. And the staff was pretty darn friendly too!"}
{"text":"Let me start this negative review by saying that I do adore Cartel's cobb salad.  Adore.

But I'm going to go out on a limb and say it should not take 20-30 minutes to make a cobb salad.  That's happened to me at least twice now.  The first time, the only person in the shop who could make a salad, apparently, went out to eat lunch...so I had to wait to eat lunch.  The second time, to be fair, I didn't time exactly how long it took, but I was able to listen to almost all of the new Rihanna album before I finally got up and asked for a status update.  And apparently, my salad had been sitting for who knows how long in the back.

I have now been to Cartel enough times so I know how to make this salad myself.  And I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Doing Specialty Coffee right in the Old Town. So nice to see a place that is putting their foot down and not even offering foo foo corporate nonsense coffee. This is the real deal here. Nice work!"}
{"text":"I am a huge coffee fan so when I a heard about this place I was excited to check it out. It's great that there's another independent coffee house in downtown Scottsdale.

I liked the decor, free wifi, and the staff was friendly enough. I ordered a black coffee from Guatemala which was a little weak for my taste - I'll try something else next time.

I usually drink 4-5 cups of coffee house coffee per day and found the $4.25 (5.25 after tip) expensive for drip coffee. It was served in a pint glass which was strange but OK with the sleeve. 

I'll stop by again but I gave it 4 stars because it's a little expensive to make it a regular place."}
{"text":"Great coffee, nice environment. Just moved to town and was glad to find a nice coffee spot right away with knowledgeable baristas. Grabbed a pour over and a shot of espresso - both were tasty."}
{"text":"Very good coffee. Interestingly the brewed coffee is a lighter roast.  I asked why light and they replayed that use lots of beans to get the flavor and not cover flavor with a dark roast.  Interesting and a concept I am going to try."}
{"text":"Best coffee! Made in an artisan way. Each cup individually made.  greAt atmosphere looks totally hip. Good music. Very clean.  Very polite patrons hangout and converse."}
{"text":"Cartel is full of coffee geniuses. They really care about their product. I've also been to the one in Tempe, where they took the time to discuss proper brewing technique. They'll give you more than you ever wanted to know: time, temperature, coffee/water ratio, etc. They even gave free samples to help us purchase beans."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee! Truly a one-of-a-kind coffee flavor experience. 
I'd agree with some of the other reviews that this place definitely has a hipster vibe, but thankfully the staff was kind and helpful. 
The \"condiment\" bar only had some cane sugar syrup and I had to ask the barista for some cream- just a heads up."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place when I first moved out to Tempe, and even more excited to get a real macchiato. The coffee is great, but the customer service is hit or miss. As much as I would like to make this an every day go-to, I just can't justify the time it takes to recieve an order. I get it, great things take time, but unfortunately I can't leave 20 min early just to get a cup of coffee before work or school.

TL;DR
great place if you have time and patience. Not a good pre work/class stop"}
{"text":"I recently arrived in Phoenix and as a professional barista both in the USA and Australia (I'm Australian) for well over a decade, I immediately went looking for decent coffee.

I was told that Cartel was the goods, so I checked it out.
Ordering an espresso tests the barista's skill level, as there is no milk to cover up any shortcomings in technique, the roast and the beans themselves.

The drink I received had a rather pale crema, which tends to indicate underextraction. A quick taste confirmed this with astringency, sour taste and extremely thin mouthfeel.

I took the beverage back where the barista tried to tell me that it was my fault that the drink was unpalatable. Because I hadn't finished it, it was now stale. 
But the reality was that I didn't finish it because it was unpalatable.

The barista agreed to remake the beverage again, this time, to her credit it was far more palatable.

Still, blaming the customer for your shortcomings is very poor form."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! Staff always so knowledgeable and helpful. Not to mention the coffee is extremely tasteful! I crave their dirty chias! If you're looking for a place to settle down and do some business or school work, it is a great environment for just that!"}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee is one of my favorite places to get coffee and work. Some coffee places rush you and don't want you to hang out and work. But Cartel actually has a pretty good business environment. I also really like their coffee. The iced mocha is the best in town - and I've had mochas from every other coffee shop. I highly recommend Cartel."}
{"text":"My granddaughter and I rate Cartel the BEST Chai in Phoenix. We treat ourselves everytime I have an opportunity to pick her up from school! She gets iced and I love it hot:)"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to hang out. Like a lot of people is saying, this has a hipster vibe. I like this place and I like their iced chai. Plenty of seating, but have always been packed whenever I go , so it's harder to go with a friend. I like that they've added the extension of the coffee bar to the other side with booth-like sitting room along with high-top tables."}
{"text":"Cool little place to chill on a Saturday morning. Great coffee, and the coconut scone was delicious."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting an amazing cappuccino in the desert, but this place could rival many of my favorite spots back in Seattle!"}
{"text":"I loved Cartel for a long time but slowly realized the amount of aloofness given off by the patrons. Always delicious coffee and their score shouldn't necessarily be penalized for the \"better than you\" vibes given off by the customers, but a few times I've gotten less than perfect service from the baristas, who given, are doing all they can to keep things flowing. They are often very busy but wait times to order are not too long. Extra points to them for the latte art."}
{"text":"Cartel is a great Phoenix cup of coffee. I have to admit, when you're in NYC, SF, LA, in particular-- you're exposed to some of the best coffee in the world. 
When you're in Phoenix, however; Cartel is a quite decent local roastery. My go-to drink is a Gibraltar. If you have a palate for smooth espresso and you're able to diffentiate quality from garbage.... you will appreciate this place :) Ambiance is great too at all locations. I'm not giving it 5 starts because their restrooms are horrendous. Regardless of gender, I prefer Male & Female restrooms to be separate. Men simply are not as clean as women when it comes to restroom cleanliness. I honestly think they would draw in more people and have even more repeat customers if they invested in revamping the restrooms at both the Tempe & Scottsdale locations."}
{"text":"Cartel is fine. I go here a lot because I live right next door.

Cons - The service is hit-or-miss. They have a small staff and are pretty busy so it's usually about a ten minute wait from entrance to exit if you're getting coffee to go. The line takes a few minutes and the drink takes a few minutes. 

Pros - The coffee really is good. The people that make the drinks are skilled and everything comes out delicious. The atmosphere is artsy, funky and fun. 

Prices are okay. About the same as Starbucks and more expensive than Xtreme Bean, but a better product for sure.

I think Cartel has cultivated a loyal following of people that come for the coffee. Convenience is probably also a factor because of the sweet location. If you really care about high-quality coffee, I'd say it's worth the effort. If you're just in the mood for an iced chai, you'd be better off going to wherever's closest to you."}
{"text":"They feature a different black coffee each day - super unique and they tell you not just the country but more specifically where it's from. Great vibe for business or catching up with friends."}
{"text":"Love this this place the drinks are kinda pricy for the size but overall the dirty chai is the best !"}
{"text":"I love this dark, hipster coffee shop. It's really easy to set up shop and get some work done here. There are a ton of couches and tables, but it can be difficult to find space right away. It can get pretty busy with college students who stay most of the morning to get work done. They coffee is pretty straight forward. They don't have a ton of flavors like Starbucks, but it's a great place to get a good quality latte or americano if you like the taste of coffee and not sugar syrup. They also serve beer in the 21 and over section (in the back where the couches are) I tried a coffee kolcsh they had a while back and it was delicious. I think they only have 3 taps so they won't have a ton of beer selection and they'll probably focus on craft beers."}
{"text":"This place is hidden in a strip mall very close to ASU and when I walked in I was surprised how large it is. Very funky with lots of tables, benches, counters, couches to study or work at. Quiet enough to concentrate with music as background noise more than anything. Chill atmosphere and will definitely be back. Hopefully next time I'm here there are pillows for the seating - that'd make this place 5*."}
{"text":"the coffee here tastes like berries. I was told by a barista at another coffee shop that it should taste like berries, since coffee beans are actually seeds from coffee berries.

I've had the daily coffee and cold brew and I got the same bright, fruity flavor.

the staff was very friendly and prompt with service. there is plenty of seating around, now that they have expanded. they have wifi, but it seems a little bit too loud for studying. it's a super hip place and a good place to hang or meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Gotta love the vibe at Cartel. Before I even get to the coffee, the place itself deserves recognition. Local art, some for sale, covers the walls and is always changing. The music is always spot on, the couches are comfy, and when you leave your clothes smell like a nice dark roast for the rest of the day (I suppose some may not like this but I rather enjoy it). 

As for the coffee, prepare to get your buzz on. I always get a hell of a pick me up from my go to Cartel Americano. Exceptional flavor, fresh, and just as good iced as it is hot, they rarely disappoint. My only complaint is the cost, but considering their support of local art and business, I can deal with the additional charge."}
{"text":"I ordered a breakfast burrito and a latte TO GO.

The burrito was delivered in less than 5 minutes. After that I sat and waited an additional 10 minutes for the latte. There were 4 people waiting for coffee when I ordered. 

I get it that they take their coffee seriously here but 15 minutes for a latte when it's dead?? 

Burrito was ruined/inedible because the potatoes were basically raw."}
{"text":"Tucked in to a non-descript strip mall, this is the best coffee in town.  The clover machine puts out a perfect steaming cup of coffee, one at a time, and the iced toddy (cold brewed) is amazing.  They use high quality, organic milks for all the lattes, etc., and my wife swears by the chai latte.  Only thing missing is perhaps some pastries (tammie coe, anyone?), but that's it.  The service is always great.  If I didn't live so close by I'd still make the trek over without a doubt."}
{"text":"I had a great chai latte here.. no overly empressed with the service. I think they guys working could have been a bit friendlier but maybe they were on edge because of how hot it was inside. I did enjoy the atmosphere however. Most importantly the coffe was great!"}
{"text":"Cartel provides a much more personal cup than competitors, with their great customer service and care taken in making the product taste perfect as well. Don't know how they did it, but the latte was delivered at perfect temperature and I didn't burn my mouth which is a rarity."}
{"text":"After asking where the list of flavors were for a latte he said we have agave we have... Stop. I will have an agave latte. Great ambiance in this hipstery coffee shop. There's plenty of room to sit but everything is metal, wood, and concrete so the seats are cold. Make sure to grab a hot beverage to warm your bum! Next visit I will be choosing from their SIX different types of coffees."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at Cartel. Great pour over and gluten free muffin. I like the fact that they give you a number of different brewing option to choose from. Staff was friendly and informative."}
{"text":"Great espresso, calm enough atmosphere to get work done, better than the library for any equivalent task. The scene is not that exclusive or snobbish from my experience, despite what others say."}
{"text":"Best chai tea latte I have ever had...like E.V.E.R.  Wish they were on the Belly local rewards program."}
{"text":"The most fabulous coffee in the city. 
The best service once you warm up to the barristers
& a sustainability crusader!"}
{"text":"Got a 12 oz Guatemalan as pour over. Tasted watered down/a little sour and was way too hot. For $5 I would have expected a better cup. Staff was nice enough."}
{"text":"Great place with some great drink. The decor inside is unique, and the staff was friendly to me. My only beef with this place is sitting inside may not suit your level of comfort. It was a little louder than I expected, and while sitting on the limited amount of chairs is alright, the hard benches will put your butt to sleep in minutes. I was watching a couple of students wiggling and suffering while on their laptops lol."}
{"text":"I used to live down the street from this place and would walk there almost every morning. My drink of choice is an iced Americano: super strong, smooth and delicious. I get the dirty chai when I'm looking for something sweet. They have good quality organic milk and soy milk and make their own horchata. The inside is decorated with local art and murals. 

My only complaints are:
1.) Sometimes it takes a long time for them to make your drink. Like 15 minutes long. (But I'll gladly wait around for quality.) 
2.) Maybe it's the way they roast their beans, but a large Americano has me wired for hours!!! No exaggeration, I've had a drink at 2 pm and still couldn't sleep by 10."}
{"text":"Go if: you like great coffee

Don't go if: you don't like slow service, rude baristas and unnecessarily loud music

Still, great coffee and espresso though."}
{"text":"Well done, Cartel.  Well done!

I am in town for business, and needed a cup of coffee that is nearby.  Not having a rental car, I needed something within walking distance of my hotel ... who knew I would luck out and find this hidden gem so close! Not only was I very glad that I didn't have to fall back on my \"safety cup\" (SBUX - also nearby.  After all, when aren't they?) but I was very pleased with both the quality of the coffee as well as the friendliness of the barista.  (She happily shared that she and her sister had just returned from a barista competition in California and came back with not only some new tricks she was eager to try out, but a new-found love for her job.  Passion like this is rare, and I firmly believe is the secret ingredient to a successful cup of coffee).

My drink of choice is an americano with an extra shot, some cream and a couple raw sugars. (I know, I know... but hey, I like what I like!) That being said, it's also a risky choice. If the grind isn't right, I can often get stuck with an extra strong cup of undrinkable sludge.  My fears were quickly laid to rest as I took that first wonderful sip... Eureka!  Amazing.  

The only knock I would say is that they have the simple syrup for sweetening instead of granulated raw sugar (which is my preference). But, you know what?  That's the beauty of their shop... they do it their way. And the other thing?  While I was waiting for the bottle of syrup to be refilled, I snuck a sip without sweetener, and quickly realized I didn't need any sugar. It was silky smooth and wonderfully full flavored all on it's own (the way, I imagine, it's supposed to be, right?).  About the time I realized I no longer needed any sugar, she brought out the new bottle... and while feeling bad for making her go through the trouble for me, I passed on the sweetener and enjoyed the cup the way it was: perfect.  (I did pretend to put a couple pumps into the cup so she wouldn't feel like she did that for nothing.)

The atmosphere has a cool urban industrial vibe to it, and it really works.  The only bummer is that it was somewhat hidden and hard to find (nothing that pacing up and down University for a few minutes with my iPhone didn't fix, though).  But like wine is better for the struggle the grapes have to go through in the dry environment, this coffee tastes better because of the sense of adventure in finding it. Okay, now that may be a bit of a stretch, but it was definitely worth the little extra bit of effort to find it.  

I really like the name as well.  We all talk about caffeine as a drug, and the hardcore coffee drinkers (like myself) are addicted and willing to suffer less than ideal cups of \"coffee\" just to get our fix and avoid the dreaded headaches. So in a way, your barista is like your dealer... and their supplier?  The place they get their \"stuff\"... a cartel.  Brilliant.

All in all, this is a great joint and I look forward to the next four mornings here in town, because I know where I'm getting my fix..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It looked like it had a cool vibe from the outside so I decided to stop by and try them out one day. I probably won't come back. 

The vibe is the typical, SF, Seattle hipster hangout. Being from the NW, I've been to quite a few of these types of cafes. Whether or not you're down with the whole vibe, there's one thing in common....good coffee. These guys do not know how to make good coffee. It took close to 10 minutes for the guy to make the coffee for me and it tasted like water. I expected so much more considering when I asked for soy milk in it, the guy looked at me as if I had the never to disturb the natural essence of the brown water he was about to prepare for me. He told me \"he'd put it on the side'. Please...this ain't Mastros Steakhouse and I'm not asking you to put A1 steak sauce on a filet mignon. This is coffee, of which you need a little instruction on how to make. Plus..If you're going to act all \"hipstery\", \"Seattle-ly\" and try so hard to make and decorate the place like you don't care, then don't locate in Old Town Scottsdale. Also, there was a dirty kid sitting on the table right next to the water dispense having a full on conversation with a barista.. Freaking dirty yo....."}
{"text":"I love your honey latte, but I won't be able to come anymore because you have no parking and I got a $50 parking ticket for going in to have coffee when my meter was 5 minutes over.  Can you work with the City of Phoenix to get parking or meters with credit card swipes?"}
{"text":"We came in at a time when they weren't that busy. I checked out separately from my buddy but we both just ordered iced coffee. We stood there awkwardly by the counter for ten minutes before asking the woman behind the counter. She claimed many people had been taking others orders and that must have happened to ours. We were the only people there so we saw everything that was coming and going, none of the drinks were ours. She got our drinks but not even an apology."}
{"text":"One of the best places for good coffe in the valley, if you ask me. Just I find the baristas behaving a bit snobbish, in the Tempe location. Hence, one star less..."}
{"text":"I am in town for work and went there for a brunch. Hard to find parking since it's downtown. End up using one of the meters across the street. 
When you walked in, you could hear the loud music, which is kind of weird in the morning. I like the atomsphere and decor. Waitress took my order quickly. I had a latte and the pork hash skillet. Got the latte quickly and it has those pretty pattern on top. It was good but since I am not a coffee drinker, I couldn't tell how good it was. The skillet took about 15 minutes and it came out very oily. Taste is not bad though, but it's a bit heavy with all the oil. 
I think it's a brillant idea that they use the venue for coffee in the morning and a bar in the evening. The setting is definitely great for people to hang out and chill. 
I am just not sure the loud music is a great idea during the day."}
{"text":"I came to this location, as I remember having great experiences with the Tempe location a few years ago.  Unfortunately, the space is very cold and sterile, and my experience was pretty blah.  The coffee itself was great, but the baristas did not seem enthusiastic or happy to be serving.  I remember the Tempe location being lively and with warm staff.  I hope that this location can \"beef up\" their vibe and be more welcoming to customers that want to enjoy their coffee in a warm environment.  Also, it would be great to offer some food options besides cookies and small croissants."}
{"text":"Coffee is good, but pretty sure I just needed up some ones morning, noticed I grabbed the wrong coffee when I was half way down the block. People that work there are super chill, very relaxed atmosphere. Love it and even though I grabbed the wrong coffee it's still really good"}
{"text":"Wow! Loved this place! Great ambience and such friendly staff! great coffee and pastries!"}
{"text":"This is a sit-down and take-it-all in place, not unlike coffee shops to be found in places like San Francisco. if you're in a big rush and want things the way you're used to and don't like adventures, please go to Starbucks - there's one right down the street.
Cartel makes each cup one at a time, so you get something truly unique. There are always many different flavors being brought in and switched out, so ask questions and make sure you get something in line with your tastes - unless you like surprises!"}
{"text":"Ah good coffee is good for the soul, man!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Cartel since their opening month. Over the years they have grown substantially and their product only gets better. They take the time to explain their process if you mention that you have never been there. I love trying their ever-revolving door of coffee beans that I then prepare at home. Their toddy is out of this world as well. They recently changed their espresso (again) and this may be their best yet!

I highly recommend this place for any and all coffee lovers.

Oh, and try their tea! It is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"felt old, loved the smell of the place.  great artwork on the walls.  good business.  it was hidden behind stores that faced the main street, thanks GPS.  the coffee was great.  and not overpriced.  good coffee places are always something to look for.  this makes the short list."}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for this place. My cousin and I both ordered an iced chai. There was so much milk in it, you could barely taste a hint of the chai. We both thought it tasted like cereal milk. Two sips and we tossed both our drinks. What a waist of almost $9. I might go back and try a regular coffee but until then, 1 star remains."}
{"text":"YES. If you want coffee at the airport this is the place. The baristas are excellent and  customer service is excellent. Cartel has a variety of coffee making methods that include some not seen at any airport coffee stand. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Well....the coffee and pastry was very good....but the baristas need to find a personality.  I don't expect to get hugged or anything, especially being from the Bay Area, but come on man....don't treat me like you're doing me a favor getting me a coffee and then basically ignore me when I want some cancer causing fake sugar.  Maybe I DONT want your honey that you use for sugar....jeez!!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot.

Found it randomly after doing some yoga next door and needed a pick me up as I was in total zen mode.

It's a small, but cool and open spot with personality and vibe.

Came here to work as well and it was super chill.

I gave it minus a star because there's nothing out of this world about it, but it's still an awesome spot."}
{"text":"I was just recently introduced to Cartel and I am seriously hooked! The soy chai is the BEST EVER. The atmosphere and employee's are very welcoming and always friendly...cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this little place! Delicious coffee (drink and beans.) One of my 3 favorites (Cartel, Stumptown and Lux).

The times I have had food here, it's been great too. 

I have had nothing but great service. 

My office is moving into this area of town, and I'm very excited I'll be able to walk to Cartel!"}
{"text":"Killer Cappuccino.  Not exactly sure why, but think its the beans used(they roast their own),  the coffee/water ratio and the creamy dense topping that I was told is milk, not cream. 

This place takes its coffee seriously.  NYT's had an article few months ago about NYC coffee shops improving their coffee: each cup made to order, no espresso's or capuccino's to go, foamed milk done per cup (vs prefoamed in big container), ideal espresso/cap ratios(no skimping on espresso grinds) etc.  The Cartel's coffees are as good or better than any I used to go to in NYC."}
{"text":"I got a thing for out of this world coffee and \"earthy\" chicks with a tattoo here and there; therefore, I love the Cartel Coffee Lab. The baristas are phenomenal as well as the vibe and music. The food is surprisingly fresh, yummy and fair priced. There is also a good selection of draft imports. It's a perfect hideaway from the pretentious neighborhood. Wi Fi has never been a problem. It's a 5 star coffee house in my world."}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee and pastries but the service is mediocre and it can take forever because of the way they make their coffee. The place is a little small and they do what they can with what they have but I always feel like I am in someones way when I am waiting for my coffee. Definitely not the place to go for a quick, decently priced coffee. However, if you have time to kill and want to try something new, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great location in old town.  Not the most warm welcome, but the coffee was fabulous!  Had the cappucinno and sister had tea.  Tea had the loose leaves."}
{"text":"Amazing mocha and perfect banana bread. I am visiting here again next time I am in town."}
{"text":"In town for a Microwave conference, I was in dire need of a place to escape the hustle and bustle of business, especially after a late night of partying with Yelp friends Shane A. and Sharon M. Someplace with great coffee, good food, and the right atmosphere. Thank God and Baby Jesus that Cartel was just around the corner from the convention center. 

To eat, I had a delicious bowl of breakfast porridge from collocated Kaleidoscope. It was a perfect healthy option considering I ate a business person's special from Pedro's in Glendale last night. I balanced it out with a fancy pop tart from the Cartel counter, and topped it all off with Cartel's world famous cold brew, which could wake the dead. I am now ready for a day of business."}
{"text":"The coffee is fine.  I am very thrown by the fact they don't have any creamer or sugar for taking.   Their poor costumer service skills is the single reason I do nor plan on caffinating here again.  They yell at their customers which is just poor business altogether."}
{"text":"The baristas are always very friendly (as well as trendy). They execute orders promptly and well. I forgot my wallet and learned that this location does not take Apple Pay, however they were very friendly and gave me a drink on the house. (A very good way to keep clientele loyal). It is always a pleasure visiting"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp... I only wish i had six Stars... Ok officially for anyone reading this pretend there are Six Freaking Stars... This place is THAT good!

I thank Yelp because the only way I found this place was searching for 'third wave coffee' (those who know what I mean by this will just know... everyone else will just have to experience and forever after never drink Starbucks again) while I was traveling in Tempe.  

I don't 'like' coffee, I LOVE it (insert Antono Ego voice from Ratatouillie movie here)... I literally have a coffee shrine in my house where I run a vintage Rancilio Z11 and pride myself on my espresso skills.  Simply put, I will never pull a shot like i had here.  Off the chart awesome!  

So that's the first 5 Stars...the Sixth star?? I just can't believe they have GOOD pastry too!  I understand they produce in-house and if that's true then it's completely astounding.  Easily the best croissant I've had outside of Paris.  Run, don't walk to the Coffee Lab; it is worth the flight to Tempe."}
{"text":"I'm torn. The coffee is probably the best I've had anywhere in Phoenix, but the service is possibly the worst I've had anywhere. The dudes are nice, but must be lacking any previous cafe experience. The place is super busy on a Saturday morning, but due mainly to the exceptionally slow service. Lets do some numbers. We walked in at 10am, waited in line until twenty past, and still didn't have a coffee in our hands by 11. Then after much fumbling and confusion, they lost our order twice before informing us that the grinder was broken. We went down the road and had a great coffee from the ice cream shop in no less than five minutes. Perhaps this place really is a lab fronting as a cafe."}
{"text":"Okay, so its probably unfair for me to review cartel.  I went there to pick up beans.  It was pretty clear that the beans I was buying weren't roasted recently.  (They told me they were about to roast.)  But, I was desperate.  In all fairness, the beans smelled awesome. Yet, the taste didn't get close to the smell---not delicate at all---much more grocery store like.  I will go back and try when their beans are fresh.

Atmosphere looked great.  I was more than slightly (ehmmm) insulted when they suggested that I was dropping off my kid for college.  Last I checked, I wasn't nearly of that age group."}
{"text":"Great coffee and great coffee selection!  They always have a few interesting coffee choices in addition to the standard coffeehouse drinks like lattes, you really can't go wrong no matter what you choose.  One day I will get a growler full of their beer, I'm sure it's awesome too!  Service is generally pretty good.

It's a small place with a few tables, nothing too comfy but nice enough.  My only real complaints with this place are: 

They have items for sale all around the same place where you get lids, sugar, etc.. which is annoying if you're trying to get out of there only to try to navigate around someone looking at tea blends.  

It's unclear to people who aren't regulars where to order and where to pick up, this causes unnecessary crowding in the wrong spots and general confusion.  The last time I was in there a guy was waiting at the pickup area so I walked up to place my order, he then called me out stating he actually had been there first but no one told him where to order.  I would have hoped the staff would have said something (like my bad, we should have acknowledged you) but they didn't - I allowed him to order before me but I was mortified nonetheless.

To sum up: awesome coffee, mostly good service, poor set up."}
{"text":"Zero (0) stars if I could!!! Nobody will \"experience your coffee\" if you are a pretentious asshole. You may \"do things differently\" but not in a better way. I would rather lick day old burnt coffee grounds out of a Circle K carafe than drink/eat/buy anything you are offering. A local company representing a city in an international airport should know customer service comes first. Shame on you Cartel, you are an embarrassment to my hometown."}
{"text":"Very high quality coffee, well worth the 15 minutes detour we had to take to get here.
Tried a couple of them, my favorite was San Ignacio. Service is a bit slow but the quality of coffee is top notch."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee! Stop by and give it a try at least. Way better than Starbucks!!! The employees are all very nice and willing to share their knowledge as well."}
{"text":"After asking politely, I could not get a \"to go\" espresso b/c it would change the way it was meant to be enjoyed.  While I completely appreciate a vision and holding to standards, I really just wanted an espresso to go.  You own the product, not the process in which I enjoy something.  You're just not that cool.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Nerd Out on Coffee in this joint, I haven't had a decent espresso since I left home. This place hits every spot, local, hip, excellent beans, Weezer on the background, local art, and baristas that actually give a dam about their craft."}
{"text":"In the past eight years I saw this place truly become the best coffee spot in all of the Phoenix Metropolitan area, I am not even able to find an equal in Austin sadly.  I originally went when it was only one office and eventually was expanded to triple the size.  If you want true coffee, made the right way, with a friendly upbeat/hip atmosphere this is the place. Even though I do not drink I believe the expansion into brewing is a great one as well as having real Teas for relaxing and just hanging out.  If you love coffee, if you love hanging out, if you want to relax, go here."}
{"text":"I love me some Cartel! Checked out this space with a friend on a Saturday afternoon, and was pleasantly surprised to see it wasn't too busy (though still comfortably full!) and that I probably could've brought my laptop here to work for a few hours if I had wanted to.

Coffee was delicious, as always, and service was quick. Perfect location near parking too, which was a plus!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Cartel and for awhile now I've been so excited to have a far above average coffee option while traveling into/out of/through Phoenix. 

This would honestly be a 5-star review purely for the coffee alone, but a few times here I've witnessed folks who don't really \"get\" the upscale coffee scene be blown off or slightly mocked by the employees of this location. It might've been just isolated occasions, but it was still noticed. I think that it's so important to make a customer feel comfortable and welcome in ANY new experience--things like explaining what cold brew is if someone asks or appears confused (rather than \"try it, you'll like it\" or some such answer), explaining where to pick up coffee after it's ordered when someone appears confused, or even simply calling out customer or drink names after making the coffee, instead of plopping it down and assuming everyone knows what it is/who it is for. 

Anyway, fantastic coffee here, but since it's an airport location I would hope employees become a bit more welcoming and know that their customers will be VERY diverse and not used to a \"craft\" coffee experience, unlike a typical coffeeshop scene."}
{"text":"Many, it seems, hate this place because it has a \"hipster\" vibe. But what  if you just like industrial-looking decor? Do we all have to buy colonial furniture now? And if we all do so to avoid looking like hipsters, aren't we just pursuing a variant of hipness? Chill, sports fans. 

Anyway, I liked this place. Jeff is a friendly guy, takes coffee seriously, and there are soft chairs in which I can get some freaking work done. I use a Dell, and the Mac people did not give me the hairy eyeball - maybe because my Dell is so lame, it's hip?"}
{"text":"Incredibly competent staff are making superb espressos using a deceptively small La Marzocco machine that produces a lip-smacking, thick-crema quality cup for us espresso addicts.   No more jonesing if you go:  So GO already !"}
{"text":"My other favorite coffee shop right up there with LUX. If it's a quality cup of coffee your seeking this is one of the best places in Phoenix. It's tough to say that Cartel may arguably be the best but it depends on how strong you like your drinks really.

The ambience here is great. I have a pretty eclectic music taste but I can't always agree with some of the Barista's as DJ's. Harsh death metal one day wasn't really jiving with me in their low key transcendent environment.

One of the best things about Cartel? The staff. Totally a sweet group of people. The owners are AWESOME folks and super friendly. On top of that the other folks that work there are super swell, approachable, and very friendly.

As with LUX the presentation is always top notch. Make the best of your experience and ensure you request that they make your drink 'for here' and not 'to go'. Also equally impressive is the composting disposal setup. More businesses should follow in suit."}
{"text":"Oh how I will miss this coffee when I go home to California.  Always a perfect latte in taste, temperature and texture."}
{"text":"Two words: loud and expensive 

I ordered a large mocha which ended up costing me $6.25 - the average price of lunch. At least the lunch would have offered me more nutrients and fulfillment than this mocha. It was decent but not good enough to cost that much, definitely tasted better mochas for cheaper. And I wish they turned down the music. If they blast it, at least make it soothing music instead of ecletic music that keeps getting louder and louder.  

Pluses for the large amount of chairs, plugs and quick wifi though!"}
{"text":"While in search of espresso, I found this place and it did not disappoint. The people were nice and it seemed like a local place for the University students."}
{"text":"I'm gonna give them 4 stars because for one they make a good espresso & they probably are the best coffee shop in the area, very cozy & laid back. Friendly staff, wifi is fast, I met Reese whiterspoon outside the shop & hung out with her for an hour :) 
Great experience all the way around"}
{"text":"Best in the west is all I have to say! I have been coming to Cartel since the early days, seriously the best coffee I have ever had. The atmosphere is solid, I always enjoy the tunes, and love the staff. I love living down the road and can smell the coffee roasting as I drive by."}
{"text":"Update, two years later.  I rarely go there now.  The music is WAY TOO LOUD!!!  And it's not for the customers, but for the employees.  The customers have their own music, but are forced to turn it way up to block out Cartel's music!  They might be able to tune out the sound, but not the pounding of the bass.  Cartel, get a clue."}
{"text":"First visit here was fun. Staff was super friendly and helpful. If you buy whole beans, you get a free coffee. Their beans are packaged with the specifics of the farm from which they came: location and elevation. (Haven't tried mine yet, but the packaging is cool--would make a great gift!). The decaf Americano they made for me was robust and tasty. They also have some pastries-including a gluten-free muffin. They had a lot of these late in the day, do I'm guessing the word isn't out yet and they don't sell too many. If you are near the high C gates, this is your place. But this terminal now has a coffee shop for every pier--so you are never far from coffee. The other two are big chains, so if you have time, you can moving walkway over to this one for a more local experience."}
{"text":"Great coffee, super friendly service, awesome food, what else could you ask for from a coffee shop?
So happy this place is walking distance from my work.
The toddy is a sweet pick me up!"}
{"text":"It's about the Integrity of the Coffee?!

Really, you talk down to me (the short little man behind the counter) because putting my Americano in a 16 oz cup will ruin the integrity of the espresso.  This is laughable, rude and downright ridiculous and your coffee, while good, is not the best around.

So I go in and order a 16 oz Americano.  The very friendly young woman behind the counter informs me that they can only make a 12 oz Americano (even though they do have 16 oz cups) and offers to add shots to the 12 oz Americano.  She says that it is about the integrity of the coffee.  I ask, very politely, if they can pour the 12 oz Americano in a 16 oz cup.  Why?  Because, I happen to like milk with my coffee.  The young woman (I would use her name but I do not know it) said she was not sure if she could and conferred with apparently the person in charge - maybe an owner, maybe a manager and definitely what I would consider an unnecessary, condescending coffee snob.  He tells me that they only do a 12 oz American in a 12 oz cup because, apparently, the integrity of the coffee will be ruined if the 12 oz Americano is put in a 16 oz cup.  (Can someone explain to me two things please.  One, when did coffee, wait, excuse me espresso, obtain a personality and gain integrity?  Second, what lab work has been done that has determined that the integrity of espresso changes when poured from a 12 oz cup to a 16 oz cup?)

Then he looks at me, and in probably the most condescending tone I have heard from someone who is trying to run a business in downtown Phoenix say, \"Why, do you want to put milk in it?\"  As if milk was the mortal enemy of the human race.  I said yes, I did.  He then threw up his hands and with a heavy sigh said to the woman behind the counter, to just do it (twice) and he walked away.   

I paid for the coffee, had milk put into it (btw, they have cream on the counter, along with sugar and fake sugar and simple syrup to put in the coffee).  The coffee is good, though it is bitter.  I can think of 2 or 3 other places where the coffee is better and that will get my business.  

You, Cartel people, run a coffee shop.  You are a service industry trying to make a go of it in downtown Phoenix.  Customers are not always right, but treating customers badly is poor form  Good luck to you and may your espresso always maintain whatever integrity you feel it should have."}
{"text":"If you are stuck downtown for a convention and you want fun breakfast or lunch, great coffee and want out of your hotel this is your place.

Breakfast: Highly recommend the fresh baked scones , and they have lot's of egg dishes. 

Lunch- GF options, sandwiches and salads

Caveat - service is all over the place. Seems they haven't figured out how to correctly staff. Some days my orders were fast, other times were so slow with one girl working the register and coffee counter. 

WIFI- yes"}
{"text":"Never again. Overpriced, over hyped, overpopulated, understaffed... I can't believe I was snookered into going there a second time. I should have known, when he ordered the quadruple shot, things were amis.

1. No place to sit, bc everyone else is into being seen there.

2. Long line, very long line.

3. No you can't have the $5 muffin warmed up, bc they don't have a toaster oven.

4. No you can't have a single shot, but it's still going to be a $5 tiny cup of coffee.

The attitude is very not welcoming, bc they're overwhelmed (unorganized and understaffed). Perhaps the cost of the location is the issue. Maybe it's nicer other places."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Phoenix, maybe in the Southwest. First timers, let go of your Starbucks-ruined coffee palette and taste coffee that is roasted with nuance and care. 

It's the difference between boxed wine and a 2010 Oregon Pino. Hold the creamer, sugar and flavoring. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried them out after reading about them in an article about the top coffee shops in the U.S.  Was not disappointed. It's a unique environment, very hipster/college student style which isn't really my favorite, but it fits them. I didn't think I liked light roasts until I tried theirs. Really great coffee, great customer service. The barista took the time to teach me about their blends and products and even provided free samples to help me choose. I've returned several times and never left disappointed. I'd highly recommend to any coffee lover."}
{"text":"i can't be more explicit... literally the best tasting coffee beans in the valley. lux is great. village roastery is great... cartel is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Cool, quite place that takes pride in their product. Great coffee, which was what I was looking for but actually had a really good breakfast there as well."}
{"text":"Great cup of Columbian filter coffee.  DittoThai salad and zucchini & goat cheese scone.
Kudos to PHX airport officials for promoting high q locals. 
Great people at cartel- disturbing to see big line at star$... & no line here."}
{"text":"Best airport latte evah! Generally I feel lucky to get Starbucks in an airport so finding next level coffee in Phoenix was a treat. Worth the walk even if you are not flying out of the C gates."}
{"text":"Much friendlier than before and the coffee is bomb. Lots of hipsters. I went there maybe 4 years ago and haven't been back until now due to the incorrigible rudeness from the staff. Things have improved dramatically."}
{"text":"This place is cool. Great coffee and snacks. Great location for being downtown. Always looks and feels very social and enjoyable atmosphere. I'll be returning soon since I work 2 blocks away."}
{"text":"Great coffee and espresso! I also buy my coffee beans from this location for at home. They roast their own coffee and I believe it makes a world of a difference in taste."}
{"text":"The coffee was great, service and food was not. It took the guy for we to make the food which was an English muffin and jam and cold butter in cups. And when I asked how the coffee was made, the guy explaining it was acting as if he was better and smart than me since I didn't know \"cool coffee\". Bad, support another local business if you want a quick bite and good coffee."}
{"text":"Don't let the hipsters confuse you, if you like a good cup of coffee this is the place to go. It's slightly more acidic than most blends that I've gotten, but it remains to be one of the few cups of coffee I can drink straight without creme or sugar to mask when someone burns their coffee like Starbucks. Going during their rather unknown happy hour gets you the drinks at a cheaper price! Also a great place to just hang out if you go to ASU and you need somewhere to study, I've seen my professors in here grading papers!"}
{"text":"Tempe transplant here. Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was PACKED, wall-to-wall with hipsters sitting in oddly straight rows glued to their MacBooks. Some older women gave my husband and I the stink-eye as we walked in since we don't fit that hipster aesthetic. It was loud, but only because the ridiculous volume of the music, as only a few patrons were actually talking to each other.

After waiting in a long, but quick-moving line, we ordered a black tea and an iced mocha. Both were awful. The tea was like straight up water. You seriously could not taste any tea at all. I get it, they are a coffee place, but when you have ten items on your menu, all of them should be exceptional. The iced mocha was a bit better, but nothing to come back for. My husband thought it tasted like refried beans. I couldn't get over the oddly grainy and chalky consistency. 

Overall, don't go here unless you like to sniff your own farts. I'm pretty sure the smug generated from this place was responsible for this year's monsoon season."}
{"text":"Yay! Finding good coffee when you're an out of towner is always hit or miss and sometimes scary. Cartel was a hit. Iced agave latte was delicious. Really laid back atmosphere. Not too expensive either. Just right!"}
{"text":"Sorry but if you are going to offer both beer and coffee you need staff it appropriately. You have craft beers and need wait in line to order a beer. Because if you sit at the bar you will be waiting awhile to be served. Ok so you wait in line but because a its craft beers perhaps you would like to taste one or two first. Well you can but you still have that line. So just not practical the way they are staffed."}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY!?!?
this is coffee?
What is the crap I've been drinking all these years?
I've been working in Phoenix for a couple days and can't imagine not having at least one latte a day until I have to leave to go back home.
Nothing is as important as getting into Cartel each day!
Thankfully, I just learned they have a spot at the airport so I can grab one last cup on my way out."}
{"text":"They're a bit spendy compared to your average coffee joint, but you're definitely paying for the quality. Best cup of coffee I've had in the Phoenix Metro Area."}
{"text":"I visited this Cartel with a group of friends one night, just before they closed.  We raced over to Old Town so we could get in the door in time, and I was pleased to see that the lone barista didn't appear disgruntled by our intrusion.  We did make it pretty easy, ordering mostly the same drink (Hot Chai Latte) and paying on one tab.  He went out of his way to help my non-coffee-drinking friend choose a tea and I overheard him joking around as he steamed some milk.  He was friendly and knowledgeable; that's what I want in a barista!

The Chai Lattes are phenomenal.  I don't know what they do differently than any other coffee shop, but they turn out great.  

I like that after weaving through throngs of \"Scottsdale people\" (you know who I mean) I can walk in to this coffee shop and feel like I'm not in Scottsdale.  It's industrial, small, with cool decor.

I love the iPad that's used for placing orders, charging credit cards, and providing receipts.  It's sleek, eco friendly, and hip.  I hope that's the way of the future!

I also love that this isn't Starbucks."}
{"text":"Awesome hipster coffee hangout spot. On a 100+ day, the Toddy is a definite recommend--iced coffee brewed cold for 24 hours."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a cappuccino and was pretty disappointed.  There were five people sitting in the cafe, and only one order in front of mine, and it took a long time for my drink. It was  lukewarm, and served in a miniscule cup.  And not particularly distinctive in any way, though it looked like the barrista tried to create a cutesy design with the foam.  I'd really just prefer good, hot cappuccino in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"This is for quality coffee drinkers. The prices are higher and the selection more limited, but you won't find better coffee in Tempe. The scones are well made, the cookies are great, and the atmosphere makes it a great place to study if you're a student. It's very popular, so be prepared to wait for your drink."}
{"text":"They actually take the time to educate you if you have a question about coffee. They do this or 4 obvious reasons:
1) they care about coffee
2) they actually like coffee
3) they're kind people
4) they've been trained a lot

They have local spots which are beautiful, if AZ is your final destination check them out!"}
{"text":"Ordered a iced mocha with almond milk.. it was way too strong. The coffee tastes great but its overwhelming in the drink I ordered. It also took a while for someone to start taking orders as the line was getting longer and the workers were just standing around."}
{"text":"Cartel coffee is the best brew in the valley, and now you can get it even if you're just passing through! Located in Terminal C this gem is staffed with super friendly folks and serves delicious coffee. On my first visit I was too excited that Cartel was in the airport to decide what I wanted to drink at first. The barista was patient and kind and struck up a conversation while I was deciding. These guys are extremely genuine. Through talking with me the guy realized that a friend of mine had passed through a couple days earlier. Of the hundreds of customers they see a day the staff remembered a specific individual! The service alone is worth the visit but the coffee can't be beat either. Don't miss the opportunity to experience great people and quality coffee next time you're in the airport!"}
{"text":"I've been to almost all the locations during my road trip back to Chicago. I appreciate not only the coffee but the ambience. Every location was a bit different but overall a great experience with good staff and work spaces."}
{"text":"Once again I have found myself in the east valley and have sought out the best espresso to be had in this area. Cartel is and probably always will be my favorite stop when I'm in town. The espresso is exceptional and the atmosphere is comfortable."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their coffee. Sometimes I think they put crack in it because I can be so productive in that environment. The music can sometimes be too loud, but that's why I like to go and sit on the west side of their store where it's much more quiet, but the new seats are very painful to sit on.

There are cons though. Their cappuccino is dry, and difficult to drink sometimes. They only have syrup for sweetener, so it's not how I like to take my coffee. The biggest con I have is their internet. I go here very often, sometimes 2-3 times a week and drop enough money there per week that they should be able to afford and maintain a good quality internet connection. When the internet is down, I can't work. If I can't work then there is no need for me to be there. 

Pro: they know coffee. I like the pallet cleanser with the water that they give you for espressos. Their barista's are ultra hipster, very friendly and I think are hard working. I like all the recycled art they have in the store and enjoy seeing it grow into something for the community."}
{"text":"Very slow food service. Took almost 25 mins to get our food. The food was good but just took too long.

The furniture is incredibly uncomfortable. Ouch!!"}
{"text":"I tried them twice while I was in Phoenix. It takes them a long time to make a latte, not sure why as they were not busy both times. The first time my latte was mediocre, the second time it was better. I feel like for $5-6 for a latte, there should be more consistency. There's plenty of seats inside to hang out or get some work done. I liked the industrial look they have going on. We also tried a cherry pop tart pastry which was good but very pricey."}
{"text":"Cartel is a solid coffee shop that can only be described as hipster. It's close proximity to ASU means that it's a popular place for college students to study. Lack of parking (mainly 1 hour parking spots) and uncomfortable seating are probably designed to help motivate people to move on - ha!

They care about quality coffee and I've never had anything there that wasn't well done."}
{"text":"It's been almost a year since I've been back to this location and the only thing that's changed is the staff. The people here now are very kind and easy-going. Coffee was beautiful and delicious. Only took a few minutes to be made. Thanks for a great morning, Cartel!"}
{"text":"I came here recently and ordered a coffee and pastry. It took a while for my drink to come out while waiting in an awkwardly cramped space where everyone is always in the way of each other..  

Also, don't let the display of pastries fool you! They all look delicious, but I am almost always disappointed. This time, my pastry was dry and pretty bland. Not to mention, my coffee was piping hot! Like too hot..

Atmosphere is nice but always so so crowded. Chances of finding somewhere to sit are like 1 out of 100000. And don't expect it to be a quick stop either, unless you have a least 10 minutes to spare. Parking..well don't get your hopes up"}
{"text":"The people that work here are friendly. The coffee is seriously great but the portions are a little small. I got a caffe macchiato and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"The employees of this place love their coffee. I was surprised to find a place like this in Arizona but they are on point! The space is clean and nice and the coffees taste great."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area from CA and this is definitely my favorite coffee shop.  The coffee is a super leaded gas machine that will wake you up ready to conquer the world!  I love coming here to work on my computer, the atmostphere is diverse, down to earth, amazing music, rounding it out with a warm modern aesthetics that is very inviting.  Two thumbs up to the baristas for your hard work yet always keeping a friendly smile.  I highly recommend visiting this coffeeshop when your in the area."}
{"text":"We are from Seattle and this place rocks! Fresh roasted beans-cool atmosphere! Phoenix may finally be getting away from the mega strip mall coffee!"}
{"text":"Prime are nice, prices are decent, espresso was good and cold brew is better than some places. Would recommend to try, and i may be back, but it wasn't my favorite coffee place"}
{"text":"God bless my Tempe Tour Guide. Wise beyond her years, leading my lost soul to caffeinated salvation.

BACKGROUND
---------------------
One fine Sunday afternoon, as my Southwest flight made its descent into Sky Harbor, Eba Cafe suddenly popped into my head. Why, I don't know.

But Boba. 

I had to have it. 

As I stepped into my dusty car sitting in the Gecko parking lot, I made a quick call to Tempe for some tapioca companionship, and I was well on my way.

But as luck would have it, Eba's closed on Sunday. Seeing the dejection  seared across my face, my Tempe Tour Guide suggested that we should take a walk. Outdoors. In the neighborhood. Because people do that sometimes. 

And so we strolled and enjoyed the cool breeze, noticing quirky 100 year-old houses and hastily discarded CRT monitors, before finding ourselves at the entrance of one Cartel Coffee Lab.

THE SETTING
-------------------
Very unassuming from the outside, Cartel is a dimly-lit world of wonder indoors.

Industrial garage-type setting with art all over the walls,  plus tables, couches and hipster college kids tapping away on a mishmash of Apple-branded products. A roaster with bags of beans for sale in the back, and the Clover coffee machine to the side. Music is as is assumed: Death Cab and various Pandora-mates. 

My Guide is all in the know about Cartel, but declares me a newbie and the barista kindly asks me if I want to hear The Shpeal. I say \"sure\" and she talks about how Cartel is about quality product and the mastery of roasting and brewing the best espresso and coffee. A few of the Cartel baristas had gone on to win the Southwest Regional Barista Championships, but instead of resting on their laurels, they're constantly looking to excel in what they do. She also highlighted the Clover machine which brews a single cup of coffee at a time for maximum quality.

I was pretty impressed by The Shpeal, I will admit. But now it was time to judge the actual product.

THE PRODUCT
----------------------
So, as one who sadly became averse a few years ago to having real cappuccinos unless I planned on staying near a bathroom for the rest of the day, I've gotten used to drinking a lot of black coffee. And as Starbucks probably makes the worst drip coffee known to man, I was looking forward to trying the Clover machine's output. But then the barista threw me a curve ball.

\"You know, it's hot outside. Do you want to try our Espresso Excelente? It's iced! And it's pretty damn tasty.\"

\"Uh, what is it?\"

\"Espresso, combined with our own horchata, cream, and a dash of cinnamon.\"

\"I'm not a big froufy coffee-drink person, and I was looking forward to just a plain cup of coffee, but now you've made me curious. And it is hot outside. Except I have this lactose thing, so I guess I can't have it. Doh.\"

\"Doh yourself. We have soy cream we can use instead.\"

\"Sold!\"

VERDICT
--------------
Incredible. And not just because Cartel has Business Continuity Plans for people with lame digestive tracts. Whoever came up with the horchata-espresso idea is a genius. All the flavors in my cup were perfectly balanced, and there was absolutely no bitterness in the espresso. This barista knew what she was doing, delivering me one of the best espresso drinks I've had in a really long time.

And my Guide, standing beside me, looks at me and smiles in a Zen sort of way. Omnipotent, and serene. I told you she was wise.

FIVE STARS, MR. K?
---------------------------------
Eba what? Who gives a flying hootenanny about tapioca. Cartel is where it's at, because my drink was that excellent.

Which causes a conundrum, obviously, because I may have to re-rank every other coffeehouse in town accordingly. These guys are leagues ahead. 

However, to be fair, I'll probably update this review on future trips when I  try three more of my regular drinks:

* a plain cup of coffee
* an Americano
* a soy latte (probably the hardest drink for any coffeehouse to do really well)

Given how serious they take their craft, though, I'm sure each will be exceptional.

I also give props to zero attitude from the staff. They definitely have the potential to be all about their own uber-barista glory, and silently tell non-hip looking customers like me to stuff it, but they're far from it.

SYNOPSIS
---------------
Cartel Coffee Lab = Perfect independent free WiFi Tempe coffeehouse. Strongly recommended for coffee purists who enjoy true quality drinks . No run of the mill Starbucks crap here. And as the weather continues to heat up, I have a feeling the iced Espresso Excelente is going to be pretty damn popular.

Also, my Tempe Tour Guide is full of wise and awesome.

-fin-"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a strong cup of coffee.  The staff is friendly, outgoing and stylish.  I come here on a weekly basis with my wife, we usually get an iced americano and a cold brew.  The baristas usually pull good shots and nearly every experience is an excellent one.  The corporate lobby is mid century modern, sharing with other businesses in the building.  I wish they had their own seating, but I understand because of the location."}
{"text":"Dirty Chai? Why yes please. Great location and great people working and the iced coffee is refreshing on a hot day. They even make affogatos."}
{"text":"To follow up again: 

I went back some time ago and they still failed to correctly pull a shot of espresso. 

I also left a direct message for them, a private message that should have been a \"retain a customer\" slam-dunk, but they didn't get back to me. 

They're just not interested in correcting training/mechanical issues nor responding to consumers who reach out. I deserve better, and in this town I can get it at any number of shops within a few-mile radius."}
{"text":"I'm giving one star only because it was suppose to stay open till 10pm but when we got there 9:20pm the door was locked and the guy working there totally ignored us and other customers trying to get in.  I thought how ironic as the door has a sign that says yelp love us and it was indicating that it was still open."}
{"text":"We had a business meeting here and pretty much took over the place.  It was early in the morning and there was still room for the other customers.  We got yummy eggs and muffins, and probably the bet cup of vanilla latte that I've ever had.  If I lived in the area, this would be a regular haunt for me."}
{"text":"Ordered a Chai coffee. It was the best coffee I ever had, but it was too sweet. Went again and asked them for half syrup. That then became the best coffee I ever had."}
{"text":"The coffee is prime here. I always get a Soya Dirty Chai Tea Latte and they're always super quick and friendly. Their homemade goodies are delicious and the ambiance of the place is supreme. Good chill music, you can enjoy the sounds of coffee beans being roasted aside you, and they have their cute Cartel Brewery next-door."}
{"text":"Cool third wave coffee shop in downtown PHX. Small, but shares the seating area with other businesses in the same building, interesting setup. I got the El Bosque (Chemex) and it was one of the most unique I've had. Appeared like it would be weak but it wasn't, didn't have all of the overpowering bitter notes of a lot of coffees so whatever their Chemex method is, it's a good one."}
{"text":"Just go and have the best coffee in town and shut up about hipsters, uncomfortable chairs, not enough wall outlets, and the fact that they market specialty coffee. That is why they don't want to put flavoring in your coffee. They take pride in the unadulterated product. If coffee isn't your thing, go to Dutch Bros."}
{"text":"This was the perfect place for a mid-morning pick me up.  I was feeling sluggish while waiting for my flight. Cartel Coffee Lab came to my rescue! Try their iced coffee...it is a delicious treat that packs a jolt."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location, but I loved it! I had their vanilla latte and it was just so delicious! I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Coffee is really good. They have a handful of brews. Cappuccino is a little more like a latte but tastes awesome. Comfortable seating, seating with tables and bar seating. 
We walked up just as 4 or 5 other people were ordering and it was a little chaotic but nothing that would detract me from coming back...just kept me from giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"Sitting at one end of the motel(?)-converted-strip-mall adjacent to Buffalo Exchange, finally found Cartel.  Ironically I heard a rave about it from Jeff M last year, and I'm glad I didn't have a chance to read his recent review.  I'm your typical social coffee drinker, so maybe I would of felt undeserving to grace the doors based on the flack, but my gal pal and I got no attitude what-so-ever.  

In fact the blond barista definitely knew her drinks and graciously explained away.  I didn't have to worry about an order faux pas with my iced mocha, but my friend definitely didn't get any flack when she hoped for a caramel macchiato offering.  Once advised it's not a la Starbucks style, she was gently steered into an agave-flavored ice latte.  Besides both drinks being awesome, I agree w/ Jeff -- it IS about service -- and this barista hit it right on."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick non fat iced latte from Cartel before boarding my flight - fast friendly service! If I'm in this terminal again, I'll surely pay them another visit and perhaps try out a new drink. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I've heard of the lore of Cartel Coffee from my brother, a good friend and several other people but since I never drank coffee until a couple months ago, I had no reason to step foot in one of their labs and see for myself. 

Well when it came time to drop of my girlfriends mom at the airport and we had an hour to kill, I thought coffee is good, but where..... well the Yelp app came though again and pointed me here. 

I had that moment of nervousness walking up since I'm trying to impress my girlfriends mom and not take her to a crappy coffee place, and this place does not look like much from the outside! I felt relived and overjoyed walking in and seeing how awesome it looked. My \"guests\" were equally as impressed. 

After getting our coffee we chilled on the couch talking and time passed so fast we were almost late, but luckily the airport is only 10 minutes away so it was all gravy! 

Since I don't normally drink coffee I won't be here often, but when I do, I will prefer to go to Cartel."}
{"text":"Cool little shop in a very nondescript strip mall.  Cool people, drinking cool coffee.  Best iced latte I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Best place in town to get coffee. The atmosphere is so perfect. The manager Dustin is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Coffee is super strong, just how I like it. There's a very cool college vibe here, as well as urban art. Came here with my mom and we really liked it! If fake Starbucks coffee isn't your thing, come here! You'll be impressed!"}
{"text":"Let's talk about Cartel Coffee Lab in Scottsdale. Let's!!

This place makes all of my coffee nerd/ trendy hipster senses tingle with glee. When you first walk in you'll notice there's art on the wall, and long couches, long tables. I actually love the furniture in here. There's a little indoor/outdoor hallway on the side that has a comfy couch and tables, one of which has a chess board, if you know how to play (which I don't). 

Then the coffee stuff. This is what I love the most. They have all brewing methods. French press, chemex, aeropress, you name it. Not to mention a manual espresso machine and hand poured latte art. GAH! 
The two guys working today are perfection. They are fun, friendly and efficient. Not to mention they make a killer latte. Yum. :) 
Also, I had a blueberry muffin that made my tummy very very happy. 

I love Cartel Coffee Lab. I will come back again and again."}
{"text":"I usually meet my friend at cartel for coffee. It is definitely a cute little spot in old town. Their coffee is really great also! They make pretty foam leaves on their lattes! I haven't tried their pastry, but they look sooo good! Next time I'll have to try it out! I'll be coming here again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I Love this place.
I almost go there every day. 
My favorite drink at Cartel: Hot Agave Latte'"}
{"text":"Literally the best coffee I have ever had. They have wi-fi but tell you up front that they dislike \"internet squatters\" so you kind of feel pressured to purchase more throughout the day if you stay there several hours. Dislike that. The level of hipsterness can be quite nauseating but you can get past that as long as you sip your delicious coffee and just stare at your computer screen."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! They make the best hot vanilla latte! They make it to perfection every time. Wish there was one in Gilbert. I'd go every day."}
{"text":"Just wanted a decent decaf as plain and simple as that. All they had in a decaf was Americano. Received it lukewarm and blah. Tasted like burnt beans. $5 down the drain."}
{"text":"\"Best Coffee I have ever had.\" This was the remark from a friend whom I took to Cartel for the first time today.

The place has attitude and is willing to call a customer out. Something I would love to do more than I can. If you want Caramel, or Vanilla, or a Milk Shake, or a Burrito, or Cotton Candy you need to go somewhere else. This is a Coffee shop.

They roast their own beans so they are fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Simply the best coffee I have ever had in an airport. Worth the wait. 

Note to fussy baristas--cold brewed coffee isn't always served cold. Sometimes places add hot water or milk."}
{"text":"this coffee is so good that you probably shouldn't ever go here. 

\"but why,\" you ask. \"that makes no sense,\" you proclaim. 

listen, if everyone starts going here and then i have to wait in a line next time i stop by i'm going to be a little disgruntled. the last time i was here it was totally low key and peaceful and i got to enjoy my coffee and small talk with the owner without being rushed. what a gem.. especially for me coming from los angeles. 

so please.. stay away from Cartel. for me."}
{"text":"Ordered black tea.  It was old and going bad.  Bought a fruit cup and received the core of the pineapple.  I know it is airport food but this is supposed to be Phoenix's finest."}
{"text":"Incredible coffee, on the same level as LUX coffee bar and perfect for people closer to the Tempe area. Go to LUX for the atmosphere and cartel for the coffee and make sure and try the Iced Toddy it was incredible!"}
{"text":"lets just say that I didn't particularly care for coffee til I had Cartel!! Just a great clean flavor! mmmm...my favorites are the Iced Toddy, Espresso Excelente (which is double shot with homemade horchata) and the cappuccino!  
There are only 2 coffee's I drink in this town, and Cartel is one, the other is secret!"}
{"text":"Since moving to their new location, (just a few doors down from their old stomping grounds), the atmosphere in this once friendly neighborhood coffee shop has really changed.

The homey, artistic feel has been replaced with a cold concrete and metal vibe which the aloof, hipster staff seem to mirror.

The coffee however, is still some of the best in Phoenix and although I have yet to try any of the menu items from the new kitchen, I'm sure they are superb.

Hopefully the new Cartel will figure out how to breathe some life back into the concrete world they have created before alienating too many of their loyal customers."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing coffee!! I highly recommend their Chai. Best Chai in town hands down!"}
{"text":"Best espresso in Phoenix and best espresso within an airport. Watch out Portland!"}
{"text":"If you're stuck at the airport this is a great spot to hang out. Great coffee even the coffee snob will enjoy. Trendy feel to it which is a great change of pace from most airport spots. If you're in Phoenix try their other location."}
{"text":"I was feeling a bit slumpy on a Sunday afternoon. And as a California native who recently moved out here, I'm definitely still acclimating to the bone-dry Arizona climate. The heat really taxes me, especially when I'm already in a mental fog.

Anywayzies, I was perusing the streets of downtown Scottsdale with a friend was visiting for the holiday weekend. We both needed a pick-me-up and a task to kill a bit of time, so we decided to hunt down a caffeinated solution. Starbucks is great, but there are a ton of great alternative coffee spots in Arizona. Luckily, my Yelp search results fed me Cartel and I'm pleased to announce that I have found a new go-to coffeehouse. 

My order: an iced vanilla latte with 4 shots. Wow! There is definitely something extraordinarily invigorating about the coffee beans Cartel harnesses. With every sip, I gradually regained pep. The next thing I knew, I was bopping and singing along to a Spotify track in my friend's car. 

That said, I don't recommend 4 shots if you're already kind of awake. I think next time I'll level down to 2 shots if I'm already primed from some sort of caffeine intake earlier that day.

I also have to say that atmosphere-wise, the charm and comfort level of this place is incredible. With plenty of space, as well as couches, chairs and tables spread out amongst 2 rooms, this abode is an ideal spot for hosting a wide variety of scenarios; from a dynamic conversation between friends, to a great first-time meeting spot for a Tindr rendezvous, to a study haven for a last-minute cramming session."}
{"text":"Glad to have found this site.  My son took me there once and I couldn't remember where it was.  He is in Seoul and wants me to bring him back some Cartel coffee in July!"}
{"text":"This might be the only place in the airport where the workers care about what they do and want to be there.

Can't say that about any other coffee place in the airport."}
{"text":"Ok, so 2nd time I've visited Cartel Coffee Lab. First time around at Scottsdale location was a good experience, and happened to be in this neighborhood needing an afternoon cup o' joe so thus my stop at this locale. The place was bustling with what seemed to be happy customers which included locals, ASU students and business peeps. 
Staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. I made a selection from the current brews and went with JauJa. I was happy with my choice but for some reason it did have a slightly burnt aftertaste. Possibly beans roasted too long? I will probably give them another try but if that's how they roast their beans all the time this may not be my first go to coffee shop. I do like that they have a \"secret\" taproom in the back where they brew several beers. Will have to come back to try that out also. It was busy as well though it was barely afternoon."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't yelped about the place yet. Several months (maybe over a year?) ago my husband read a newspaper article about the Clover coffee maker and the one place in town that had managed to procure one. I was skeptical (as is my nature). It can't be that much better right? You're just saying it's amazing because you want to talk about the new hot coffee shop you discovered, right? Well, maybe. But I love this place. And I don't think it has a whole lot to do with the Clover. They roast their own beans and they roast them way differently than that other ginormous coffee chain - all a light or medium roast. Never bitter, never oily, never yucky. The coffee they make there is, obviously, the best. But I send my husband in every week now to buy a pound of beans so that I can approximate the same coffee at home. Add an edgy (though sometimes intimidating) seating area, great local art (which we bought off the wall), and smiley service...I'm sold. Can't wait to try out the downtown location."}
{"text":"Very nice selection of gourmet coffee. For the coffee snobs. No garbage syrups added here. Educate yourself on coffee, then give this place a review. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"As a barista, I'm super picky about my coffee. I love trying out local coffee shops, and Cartel is my current favorite. They have a strong selection of blonde roasts, but no dark roasts here, unfortunately. They also have a few local beers which are entertaining to try as well.

I like both the Tempe and Scottsdale locations, but I tend to frequent the Scottsdale shop slightly more often. It's pretty quiet, and serves as a nice location to do homework, read, or produce music."}
{"text":"Kind of a dark and moody vibe/atmosphere if you're into that. The espresso is smooth and dark, definitely nicer than Starbucks."}
{"text":"Am I the only person who finds this place just OK? I mean, having gone to ASU I know a ton of people who were raving about it for years. I finally came in and was sort of disappointed. 

First good thing: coffee quality was good! Nothing amazing, but definitely met my expectations. Also, the people working there were super nice! 

I was actually turned off by the decor. I am not a taxidermy fan at all, and they have a bunch of stag heads on the wall near the kitchen that are the main focus of the coffee shop. The random, red chandelier made no sense. It's like they're just trying TOO hard to achieve something PHX hipsters will like! That's basically the best way I could describe it. 

I had coffee cake and we sat and waited a good 10 minutes before we were brought anything. My coffee cake was lackluster, to be honest. Tasted like something I could get at Safeway and was a little bit stale. 

Also, if you're main selling point for your brews is iced coffee: don't run out of straws. I wore a nice, white shirt and couldn't enjoy my coffee because I was I concerned drinking it meant spilling it all down the front of my blouse. 

TLDR: hipsters trying too hard, but the coffee tastes fine. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp the other day when i was on a mission to find a place that does those cute little designs on top of their drinks.. haha lame i know. But I came across cartel coffee lab and had to check it out because of the stellar reviews!

When I was ordering, I said I wanted a drink with the coolest design and the cashier kindly explained to me that although the designs are cool, that cartels main focus and goal is really on the taste of their coffee and how its made etc.. she recommended a cappuccino for me.

Of course I received a lovely design on my drink, but she was right about the taste! It was so delicious. I've really only had starbucks coffee and the occasional dutch bros, but this place is really exceptional. Best coffee EVER.

I swear I'd be here every day for my coffee fix if they had a drive thru!! lol :)"}
{"text":"Great coffee, cool vibe, awesome people the only con is we can't take their cappuccino to go. I understand it would taste so much more exquisite to have it in house. But if you have great coffee it shouldn't matter."}
{"text":"A hot spot for the local hipster community. Coffee is delicious, yes! But staff is not very nice, sometimes they are pretty rude and pretentious. it is very cold due to poor control of A/C temperature, it is generally dark-no windows and dark walls. And the art exhibit there... well, not my style at all.
But still, if you are looking for a nice and local coffeeshop in downtown Tempe, this is the only decent option."}
{"text":"They have great tea options with regular options then fun unique ones. The bakery section is limited but each option is delicious. My only complaint is that I was meeting someone there and the location was intermittently loud. It was like each song had its own set volume and was annoying."}
{"text":"Back in PHX again and making a detour for some of the best coffee brewed. Thanks to the crew at Cartel."}
{"text":"We didn't try anything here but beware, the pictures of food posted to the yelp photos for this place are for another location. They don't serve acai bowls or protein bowls or breakfast burritos here. Just coffee and pastries and some prepackaged salads in a fridge."}
{"text":"This place is great. Excellent coffee, delicious salad, awesome decor, friendly baristas, and all for ~$17 with a tip . I ordered a latte and the eat the rainbow salad (veg). The baristas also had great taste in music (they were playing Halsey's entire album). I will definitely come here again when I fly through Phoenix."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise during my last trip to PHX. The staff was knowledgable and when I ordered an iced coffee I was happy to discover they cold-brew it there (the true champion's way) and they don't try to mellow it out with sugary syrup like ****bucks does. Not only that, we had a discussion on the merits of various cold-brew devices. A+++++ would drink again."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars often but for those of you who see my Check-in's via Yelp, you know this place is my coffee go-to! 

5 reasons YOU should get your coffee on at Cartel:
1- Its local. Support your local business and PAHLEASE stop drinking corporate crap.
2- They take their coffee seriously. Have you seen the way they cold drip coffee? or how they delicately stir lattes? Yeah, get to it.
3- The vibe. LOVE the artsy interior and the fact they promote local artists by displaying their work through out the shop.
4- They have two central locations for your coffee addiction convenience. One in Tempe on University and Ash. The other on 5th avenue in Scottsdale. 
5- They both offer delicious pastries and the Scottsdale location has breakfast and lunch options and just recently expanded their counter space to offer scrumptious beers.

It certainly doesn't hurt that the staff knows their stuff about coffee and that their service is courteous and real. If you don't enjoy your espresso here, you're only hurting yourself.

I love you Cartel!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere in Cartel Coffee Lab. Great interior design, modern/industrial, colorful, great music, hipster for sure and lots of tables for the college kids and their laptops. Lets face it, if you are a coffee joint close to a university, you better have free wifi with a drink purchase and lots of space for college kids to sit and bust out their laptop. Thank you Cartel for doing it right.

I have only been here twice but both times the service was friendly and the drink time was good. My first visit I ordered an iced americano and it was divine. The second time I wanted a soy latte but they were out of soy. Turns out they had been out of soy for two weeks or so. I said I would try the almond milk and boy.. was that a bad decision. The almond milk just isn't good in a latte. If they aren't carrying soy anymore I will stick to iced toddy's and americano's.

This coffee joint is better than many! Check it out."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere but I'm not sure I know what's so \"lab\" about it.  You will pay for that cup of java!  Their largest size in cold drinks is 16oz and 20z for hot drinks.  More and more independent coffee houses are getting away from any size north of 20oz for some odd reason.  A touristy location in the 5th avenue shopping area."}
{"text":"This is the best coffee that I have ever had. It's actually out of my way, but I have gone home \"the (super) long way\" because the flavor is like NONE other!. Hands down the best coffee that I have ever had. I also like to buy their bagged coffee for home use. 

I am not a \"tree hugger,\" but I appreciate how responsible they are with regards to the environment. 

The decor is all its own and I love that."}
{"text":"One of my hobbies is finding fun coffee shops that inspire me to work and create. 

Even before I moved to Arizona, I knew about Cartel from friends. Cartel's whole brand is \"that trendy and hip coffee shop you go to when you want to feel cool.\" It's a place that makes you feel mildly impressed/pleased when someone new in your life suggests meeting there. (I've screened potential roommates there and it's probably a fine place for a casual coffee-date.)

I will say that this \"air\" creates some hype, a bit of it unwarranted. Being so close to a huge university probably necessitated the scale of the Tempe location. Its hugeness kind of undermines the comfortable feel I personally look for in coffee shops. Sometimes there are just **too many people!!!** and I feel like I'm in Grand Central Station. There are more baristas on staff than your typical coffee shop, and not all of them are 100% pleasant. But their latte art is impressive.

The art on the walls, if I'm not mistaken, seems to change quite minimally. It'd be so cool to see more art from more local artists getting showcased, as it's clear there's a lot of foot-traffic coming into the shop. 

Finally: the coffee. I'm not going to lie and say I'm an expert on coffee. It's maybe my top 3 in terms of cold brew? Pretty good, but not out-of-this-world. Super quick to grab and go (5 mins tops), if you're in a hurry. 

I've had fun trying the different espresso drinks, at least one of which I hadn't heard of before. I enjoy them better than the cold brew. I actually insist on sitting down to have them so I can enjoy them slowly. 

But yeah, overall it does the job it sets out to do. Also, if you're a fan of tiny spoons, you're gonna love it here."}
{"text":"It's ok. Nice ambiance, just not my ambiance. I am trying to focus and be inspired where I am and what coffee I drink. The Cappuccino fell short, I couldn't even finish it. It's a shame though, because it was a beautiful cappuccino just not tasty. Moving on to the next coffee shop."}
{"text":"Place was packed on a Sunday at 5PM. Barista used two scales as he made my latte, one for the grinds and one for the espresso. Was quite good, and I'd definitely come back for coffee if I lived in the area (visiting from North Carolina). 

Unique space, great coffee, abundant seating and lively student/scenester crowd. I see why this is a popular place and well reviewed. Wasn't here when the roaster was going, but I imagine that it generates an awesome aroma which would wake one up very quickly on a cool morning. 

My only criticism would be that the staff had let the garbage can next to the lids fill up to the point where garbage was beginning to accumulate on the floor, and the restroom trash can could barely be seen beneath the mountain of paper towels; people had begun to just toss them in the general location of where the bin was, and they'd roll off onto the floor."}
{"text":"I was looking for a dark roast coffee and they said they didn't have any. I got a pretty good Americano while waiting for my flight. I would definitely try again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! I tried their iced latte which was very yummy. My sister got the iced chai latte which was also good. It reminds me of a hipster coffee shop in Los Angeles, CA called Intelligentsia. I love the fact that they have coffee and beer- pretty cool. I'll definitely be coming back here and introducing the place to my friends."}
{"text":"So glad to see independent businesses expand into airports instead of letting food service hell take over.  I first found Cartel Coffee Lab in Old Town Scottsdale and loved their coffee. It is very, very good. Even if I have a tight connection at Sky Harbor, I make time to grab coffee at Cartel."}
{"text":"The coffee here was good, but I'm not sure a $5 plain latte the size of a shot glass is worth it. I finished it before I finished walking away! Sad to say I should've gone to Starbucks. 2 stars for good service and decent flavor."}
{"text":"I like the coffee, but this venue is lacking. I would recommend the downtown location. There is a certain 1990s-mixed cassette-hackysackness smell that doesn't quite mix with the high quality coffee they brew."}
{"text":"Where students sit and tries to do homework while being visible on the social arena. It caters to the hipster vibe with wickedly strange skinny males in \"humorous t-shirts\" and scrawny beards waiting on you with content. Sure, I am NOT your clientele base. I don't play the game, and I know what phase of life you're going through -  now shut-it, and fetch me a tasty beverage.. please?! 

The idea to serve craft beer and quality coffee under the same roof is not original, but genius nonetheless. The ambiance is anachronistic, yet modern with a soupçon of retro. I enjoy balancing on the edge of my comfort zone.

The environment is also ambivalent for both a meeting of a more or less intimate sort, as well as a private moment and yet cater to the modern ostentation of narcissism of the younger crowd. (Yes, I am dating myself AND distantiate myself from a younger hipper crowd of which I have nothing but jealous content for.)

You CAN come here and treat it as a cafe while being glared at with implied antipathy - which is cool. 
You CAN come here and treat it as a bar in a sense while being catered to as a outcast - also cool.
You CAN probably come here and define this place as you see fit - it might go over well. 

In either way, I will be coming back until I figure this place out.. and if not, there is beer to taste and coffee to drink. Win-win right? Plus, they are open in the evenings... this alone is star-worthy."}
{"text":"I adore their pour over selection and their cold brew is to die for. There is ample space to relax and enjoy your coffee. Favorite unwind after work."}
{"text":"Dear Cartel,

What happened between us? We used to be on the same page: good coffee, a nice vibe, convenient. But now... I just feel like you're trying so hard to be cool or whatever. 

Today you gave me scalding hot tea in a mason jar and a tiny vintage tea cup. I know you thought you were being clever and off-beat but did you know how difficult it is to hold/carry/pour a glass that is hotter than the boiling pits of hell? The tea went everywhere. The tiny cup only held half the remaining tea. It was just so unnecessarily hipster, Cartel. 

Look, I know you mean well but I think it's time we took a break. I'll always remember when you were just a tiny coffee shop tucked into a strip mall.

Goodbye."}
{"text":"hands-down the best coffee in the Greater Phoenix area.

Passionate baristas that know their products. A commitment to quality. A great space for getting things done. I plugged in the headphones and spent a solid 5 hours here one afternoon. Had a great conversation as I was visiting from another shop in Columbus, Ohio.... This is my top recommendation in all of PHX."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how great this location was.  Having been to a few of the Cartel locations in other places in the city as well as having their espresso as guest coffees at other cafes around the country, I never imagined I would get a great shot at an airport, no matter what the brand name on the sign. But boy oh boy was I wrong.  This place had great service, an innovative customer service set up, and fantastic baristas that performed as well as their other locations.  I couldn't have been more surprised.  This was an absolutely fantastic thing to have in an airport, and it makes me want to connect through Phoenix on Southwest (they are in the southwest terminal) if i absolutely HAVE to connect.

A hidden gem."}
{"text":"I very much like this place and from a 3rd wave coffee lover's perspective, this is well worth a visit. 

I love Cartel.  Every time i make it to Arizona, I come here.  The coffee is amazing, the staff know what is up, and the decor/feel is nice."}
{"text":"The coffee is really good. Cool to see them roasting it there. They also have beer on tap."}
{"text":"Great little coffee joint in the Phoenix Airport.. it's deep in the C 10s terminal. Coffee tastes like coffee and the baristas or coffee mixologists, what's the proper term these days, were really friendly. The atmosphere is urban with a splash of hipster. Great coffee, glad we found this hidden gem."}
{"text":"I MISS YOU CARTEL COFFEE!
You were my go to for coffee while at work at the airport every day. Your coffee is wonderfully delicious. Smooth,  never burnt, or over heated,  never to strong.Just close to a perfect cup of coffee. I Wish you guys were here! 
Not only was your coffee good your staff was attentive and never hoovering. On many occasions their would be friendly chatter and laughter. At this airport location at least when I went there their was  always  at least one vegan muffin or bakery item. Which on occasion I would get. But I mostly went there for the oh so delicious coffee. 
Thank you Cartel Coffee Lab, you are the best."}
{"text":"My previous review was for Cartels old location. On the corner of Washington and 1st Street. And I've been told (because I haven't been back since they moved to their new address) that seating at the new location is much more limited then the former. 
All I can say is I wish they didn't have to move the old Cartel location was really nice. 
But I'm glad they are still close by and serving their good coffee. Please Cartel keep on keeping on with the great coffee. You'll keep making all of us smile as we enjoy your great coffee."}
{"text":"What?!? There is a Cartel Coffee downtown?! How did I miss this for so long???!! 

I only \"discovered\" this location while aimlessly wandering around on my lunch break a few weeks and have been back weekly since!  The staff here is great and friendly. And, as one of them told me, they treat coffee like more of a science here.  They know their stuff and are always sure to highlight some of the tasting and flavor notes within a particular blend.

Their toddys are the best I've had and their pastries are divine! And to make it even better, their baked goodies are all half off starting at 1:30 in the afternoon - which happens to perfectly match my lunch hour."}
{"text":"I also look for a good independent coffee shop. This one was very good, wonderful soy cortado. Will definitely come back here when in the area!"}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? Because this is the best coffee you'll ever find at an airport.

   ---   ---   ---

Of every airport I've ever been to, I've never found a coffee spot as awesome as this. You really don't feel like you're inside an airport while you're waiting on your beverage of choice. I think it might be an optical illusion, and not actually inside the walls of Sky Harbor.

Not only are the drinks delicious, but the trendy decor is as hip as it gets. And while service can vary hour by hour, the barista who happened to help me was incredibly friendly.

There aren't a ton of details one can procure from a four minute experience, but Cartel was as good as it gets across the board: taste, service, and ambiance = 3 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Terribly slow...especially when it needs to be at a fast pace in the airport terminal. Also, the coffee is not good...tasted very weak and burnt!  Where's Starbucks when you need one??!!"}
{"text":"Rude and discourteous employees. No horchata latte. Bummer waste of time. Phoenix and Tempe Cartels are completely different."}
{"text":"Amenamy - Purity Ring (Jon Hopkins remix)
CHVRCHES - Mother
Blackmill - Let It Be

Any place with a playlist like this and repurposed anything in this city merits attention. I don't really find a lot of places in Scottsdale that parallel my mood that often, but this café brings a touch of Alfred's/Intelli/BlueBottle to the area. Maybe even Philz since this is one of the few places with azn kids in the desert.

Coffee-wise, pretty comparable and yummy. Almond milk latte, dirty chais are yummy. The crowd is mixed and interesting. Favorite chill spot in the area, although it makes me emo hearing a track every 15 minutes from a band that I can't see live here. At least we got Jamie XX."}
{"text":"Visited the other day after hearing about it.. Waited about 15 min for my pour over. now understanding the time needed to make the drink it still took way too long and still rated average as far as quality, and taste which explains there expansion plans just another corporate company sacrificing quality for money..."}
{"text":"Unfortunately as of late the service has really gone down hill. I still think the coffee is great, when you can get it. If they are busy then they seem to really get the joe out, but if they aren't things slow to a crawl.  Not to mention they have messed up my order or my friend's order the last four times we have been there.  They apologize or say thanks for being patient although I never understand why we had to wait.  They seem to have enough staff maybe it's how they manage the preparation.  I had stopped ordering espresso drinks all together and just  get the cold brew since it comes out of the dispenser at the counter.  It's really a shame it used to be my favorite spot for coffee."}
{"text":"Beets Peets by a margin

Kills. Starbucks

Great cremora ( sp)?

My new favorite wakeup brew in phx.  

Thanks for the wakeup juice."}
{"text":"The best coffee at Phoenix Sky Harbor.  Take the extra moment to walk to C11-C19 in Term4 and get a Chemex or pour over.  A bonus is to support local!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Cartel location for about 8 years, when it was just one part of its size now. Love how they've expanded the menu and have monthly featured drinks and new flavors. The coffee roasters really know their stuff.

The staff is less than friendly for sure. Once you step inside it feels like you're an inconvenience to those who work there. If you're rude to them, then getting rudeness back may be expected. But just asking for coffee shouldn't get you a healthy dose of attitude back. Looks like this is something that others have written about and is the only consistent thing here besides solid cold brew. Doesn't look like it's ever going to change. If you like great coffee and being judged at the same time then this place is for you. If not, head to the Old Town Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"If I lived here, I would dehydrate here.

Cool place, yes, hipster central but a gen x person could slip through if sufficiently slovenly.  Great brew- and that is two fold, I started with a hot coffee and read the paper while seated in a cozy couch.  Then I moved into the beer room, and had a flight undoing all the learning I did whilst reading in the coffee room.  Two vices- caffeine and beer- always a winning combo.  Great beer by the way, friendly service.  You can chill here for a while or warm up with a good cup of suds or java. Why not!"}
{"text":"I love when local businesses are able to set up shop in the airport and get their brand and product exposed to a wider audience. Cartel Coffee Lab roasts their own beans and sources from around the world. Their menu is fairly basic, if you want frou-frou drinks, they have flavored syrups on hand, but you'll have to ask for them. Their cold brew is out of this world, one of the smoothest I've tasted and hella strong. 

I guess you have to get here early for their pastries, because at 9AM they were either all out for the day or they somehow weren't out yet. There's a small seating area to drink your beverage and charge your device. 

The only downside? They only do espresso drinks in ceramic cups for \"dine-in\" service at the bar. I was in a rush, so that wasn't an option. But if you find yourself at PDX with time to spare, spend it here."}
{"text":"Cartel has come to be my absolute favorite coffee shop. This location in particular is my favorite because it is far less crowded than the Tempe location and is open later than the downtown location. The ambience is far less hipster than the other cartels as well, but maybe that's just because it's in old town. Other pluses include the stocked pastry selection, clean restrooms and cool outdoor patio."}
{"text":"No dark roast. \"Trendy\" staff. Baristas openly male bashing. The squeaky, valley girl tone of voice ran me out. To boot, the coffee wasn't good at all. In fact, a bit sour. Overpriced of course. The cashier was nice."}
{"text":"- I was there March 16th.
 
     This coffee shop is AMAZING, i love the vibe, the artwork, their freshness, and of course their cookies!!
     I have already been raving to my friends how good this place is, and how we need to frequent coffee shops like this kind more often, instead of our usual Starbucks.

     The service is outstanding, as I walked to the counter I was greeted by the cashier and I bluntly told him that it was my first time there and that I was taking their Chai as well as a pastry, but I didn't know which one. He then started telling me that their pastries are freshly baked each morning at their downtown location, and that he suggested the Chocolate Chip cookie as it was his own Fav!! So I told him, You had me at freshly baked, I'll take your chocolate chip coffee and a Medium non-fat Chai. The only thing was that they didn't have medium sized drinks, they only have small or large, small is just too little for me and large is just too much, medium is just perfect for me, but no medium and I end up not drinking it all. So I took the large and as expected, I wasted about 1/6 of my deliciously large hot  foamy non-fat Chai!!! :)

    I will surely be back to frequent this spot, everyone there was oh soo friendly!! :)"}
{"text":"Best iced vanilla macchiato Great service and helpful staff. I would definitely come back to this coffee shop."}
{"text":"A top notch coffee shop in an airport!!

They know how to brew a quality pour over.  Four types of single origin coffee to choose from.  Good knowledge and excellent customer service. Not over priced or pretentious.  

Nice to have a Starbucks alternative."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in PHX I enjoy a cappuccino at Cartel. Great coffee!!! I love that you can get coffee in a real cup here. It is a small space but you can plop down and crowd watch. They also have some latte art skills."}
{"text":"For all the things that the PHX airport doesn't have (style, walk-ability, comfort, etc), it always surprises me with little gems like this hidden down it's brown, dark and depressing corridors. 

Cartel offers an alternative to Starbucks in a friendly and comforting package. Prices are about the same but the taste of the drink is just different enough to make you think you have found a whole new gold mine just waiting for the picking.

Next time you are awaiting your Southwest flight, make sure you visit Cartel for a refreshing beverage. All of this can be had before fighting with your fellow air travelers over spot A45."}
{"text":"Came here because I heard they roast their own coffee. There's several tables set up and in the middle a couch for more of a ''lounge'' experience. The espresso/americano (for a small $2ish) I ordered was really yummy. I don't drink straight black coffee or straight espresso but wanted to try it to see if i could tell the difference. It definitely was smooth and tasty. But I had to add a little sugar after a couple of sips.

The place itself is sorta of a grungy-atmosphere  but most people here are young/hip customers. The staff are young too.

This is a good place to chill/meet friends and just internet surf, but the music was a bit too loud for my taste if you're going to study here. 

Not a lot of parking space but overall a great place if you want to avoid the starbucks/chain ambience."}
{"text":"Outstanding coffee. Obviously coffee geeks like myself. Worth the walk past Starsucks. Made my morning. Thx guys"}
{"text":"I do not like it. Period. It looks old, pretentious and dark. The coffee....meh... it is ok, but not so perfect.... The place is kinda old, or looks  old and I cannot understand why people think this is a perfect place to study...."}
{"text":"These guys were awesome!  Super low key and knew their coffee! We are in from out of town and this place was a great treat!"}
{"text":"The espresso is good, don't get me wrong. However, the service is not for everyone especially not for commuters at the airport in the morning. They take a good 30 minutes for a latte and they treat you like dog crap if you ask them for updates on your drink. It's not worth it unless your delayed And you have time to spare."}
{"text":"Okay, here's how bad it is...My husband and I went to Cartel in December/January ONCE during a visit to AZ for the holidays and nine months later (today), I saw an art website that mentioned exhibiting in the Cartel Coffee Lab...and not really one to remember places like coffee shops, this was one we couldn't forget!   It was the kind of place we wish we had in our neighborhood.  The coffee is amazing, it's smooth, rich, and delicious.  Yes, they're a bit noisy, yes, they're fussy about what they serve but that can be a good thing, right?  Especially if the standards are high.  And, yes, it's hard to find.  But, yes! they have wireless."}
{"text":"When I visited AZ, this was the place I always went to. The people in there are all amazing. The coffee isn't bad and there's always a ton of people. There's plenty of new people to meet if you're a person who likes to socialize!"}
{"text":"a fave. phenomenal coffee... stellar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Trying. Way. Too. Hard.

I love my coffee and I love it most when it's within the small business community but here's where this wannabe hipster place went wrong:

1. Not enough choices for a person who knows and loves their coffee.

2. The actual coffee (wherever they say it was imported from) actually tastes like watered down mud with sprinkles of attic dust.

3. For serving sewage waste in a cup, they have the audacity to really ask a lot in price.

If you're in the area, you're better off taking a small drive down to LUX Central to get yourself something you actually might like or something at least worth paying for."}
{"text":"The pumpkin bread is very good and they're coffee is great! The barista was super nice and helpful. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The coffee was just alright. The service was lame at best. The two people on shift kept talking to what I assume is another coworker who just stopped by to chat. I was the only customer and I guess I was an interruption. Going to McDonalds would be better then this place."}
{"text":"After going around Old Scottsdale, my dad and I were craving some coffee and ended up finding this place. It was a breath of fresh air after always going to the usual Starbucks. I like Starbucks, but the coffee here has a unique taste to it...even my 6 year old sister loved the coffee here! The ambience of the place is very chill. It's very much \"hipster\" and \"artsy\". There are abstract paintings everywhere, and unique pieces of furniture. When I went there, there were many people studying and going on their computers. 

I ordered an Agave flavored Iced Latte which was the best! If you're a black coffee drinker like me, this place is amazing. The latte was flavored so it had a bit of sweetness in it, but not too much. Most of the ingredients are organic, so the coffee tasted very refreshing. I think the agave flavoring is what made the drink so unique. I have to go back to get it again, and maybe bring my laptop to relax there."}
{"text":"delicious! everything was great... very friendly and helpful staff   the iced dark chocolate  mocha was strong and flavorful my pretty and bold cappuccino woke me right up because I was dying lol!  we also ordered the  pop tart it was very light and airy and not sure what the other one was but it was bomb! soft and chewy  definitely  coming back to try the beer!"}
{"text":"This place only gets better - nice to have all the extra room since they expanded and it still maintains that funky urban vibe with interesting furniture - we sat on cardboard chairs - and the best Cappucinos in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee spot in downtown Scottsdale.  Cappucinos here are the best in the Valley - reminds me of being in Italy.  Great scones and muffins too and a relaxing place to get some work done."}
{"text":"I went to the Scottsdale location of Cartel
before I came here. This place is the best. It's a massive space, filled with all kinds of seating depending on your needs. On the right hand side is where they roast their coffee, so it smells great as soon as you walk in there. I met the head roaster when I was there, he was a really nice guy and is super knowledgeable when it comes to his craft. 

What a great way to start the day! I ordered a pour over Wahana coffee, after the barista described it as the flavor of peppers without the kick, along with a coconut scone. The scone was perfectly crumbly, not too sweet, with just the right amount of richness from the coconut. The coffee was amazing, unlike anything I'd ever had. It actually did taste like peppers, in a good way. The coffee was savory and earthy. 

I wish I lived in the Phoenix area because I love this place."}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee lab is a really great spot for some really good coffee, made how you want it. It doesn't end there, though. There's beer and wine and a selection of baked goods. I went there on a tuesday afternoon and it was packed. It's especially perfect if you need to grab a coffee after getting some Original Chopshop Co. for lunch.

I only got the classic drip coffee when I came because I realized, a little too late, about all of their coffee selection. They have different roasts and beans and can make it in the aeropress or three other types of pour-overs, including the chemex. 

Cartel knows their coffee. Their service was great too."}
{"text":"Cartel has been my go-to coffee location for the past two years; ever since I moved here from the east coast.  I've yet to be disappointed from any of my experiences.  The baristas are truly passionate about what they do, and are always friendly and helpful.  The coffee is amazing.  I regularly go for an Aeropressed Ethiopian, but have tried their espresso, latte, pour-over, teas, and cold brew.  It's all great.  If you want to run in a grab a quick cup of drip, they have that too.  I've been to nearly all third wave coffee shops in the valley, and Cartel is by far the best."}
{"text":"A must whenever you are passing through terminal 4.

I have always made a point of stopping in at this coffee company whenever I go through Phoenix international.  Approaching the staff can be a little intimidating if you're not a coffee snob, but don't that sway you. They are very friendly and willing to explain all their different types of coffee.  For the picky coffee consumers:  They sustainably source all their coffee, and do nearly every brewing method.  

Bottom line: Always a solid cup of coffee. 

Disclaimer - They do not make the insane sugary coffee things like frappes or white chocolate mochas."}
{"text":"Nice little local coffee shop right downtown in OldTown Scottsdale.  Easy to get to and park in the weekday morning since all the other shops haven't closed yet.  Friendly staff and decent prices.  Nice local atmosphere.  Agree with Roxy H. that it has that feel of the Aussie local coffee shops. For stay-in coffee they have mugs with a refill pricing that is nice."}
{"text":"Some of the best hand dripped coffee I've had since Philz in San Jose!"}
{"text":"So can I just say the peach pop tart I ordered from here is AMAZING!? 
The coffee was decent as well! I order a Gomez which happens to be my last name, coincidence, I think not. But it was a tad strong so just keep that in mind when ordering! I also got my mom a dirty chai which was really tasty! My friend order an iced latte, if I remember correctly, which she accidentally spilled on the counter because of faulty lids but the barista was so nice she cleaned up the mess and made my friend another one and didn't fuss about it. Their service was good and I would definitely go back to try different pastries and coffees!"}
{"text":"Coming off my fifth 12-hour overnight shift in a row, all I wanted was to crawl into my warm bed and play coma patient for a few days. But the amazing Ashley S. somehow snagged us tickets for the Justin Timberlake/Jay-Z concert in LA, so sleep would have to wait! Bleary-eyed, I somehow made it through security and stumbled onto Cartel Coffee Lab in the Southwest terminal next to gate C13. The lime green countertop, smiling baristas, and aroma of freshly roasted coffee beans perked me up right away. My iced vanilla latte ($5.25) was incredibly smooth, rich and not too sweet, just the way I like it. The prices are pretty comparable to Starbucks, but I'd gladly pay an extra dollar or two for a better blend. Starbucks coffee always tastes a little burnt to me, and they typically overdo it on the syrups. 

Other than Cartel, you might want to check out the airport locations for other favorite local haunts, including Le Grande Orange (to-die-for sourdough english muffins) and Cowboy Ciao (OMG that chopped salad). Kudos to Phoenix Sky Harbor for supporting the local establishments! :)"}
{"text":"one of the cutest coffee shops i've been to. the staff is so warm and friendly! i ordered a soy latte. the foam was really chunky and just wrong. but after scooping that out it tasted really great."}
{"text":"When you walk into the small door from outside your world is transformed into coffee heaven. Although I always grab a cold one on the way out, it's always nice to get some frothy espresso and enjoy a game of scrabble sometimes.

A great spot to grab a coffee off campus and to steal some time for yourself. Secretly hidden, The best way to start a hot day is with an ice cold Toddy (extremely strong iced coffee) it's got an acquired taste but it'll have you up and running in no time. Cartel's Coffee is very strong. First time I ordered a shot of espresso I even had to chase it down, definitely worth a try!!

Their addition of the Ipad in the ordering process has helped speed up order time & looks pretty cool too. So, if your in a rush grab one for on the go & if you've got some time sit down for the day. Either way, one step into  Cartel Coffee Lab awakens you. My favorite coffee joint in Tempe for sure and perfectly hidden from the close noise of ASU's Tempe campus."}
{"text":"really give it 3.5 stars.

to qualify myself, i'm not a fanatic but i refuse to drink bad coffee. i'd rather go for a red bull if i'm that desperate for caffeine. so while i'm no expert, i guess i'm a snob.

coffee was very good, but not mind-blowingly orgasmic per most of these reviews.

in town for work. always like to find a good alternative to S.bucks when i can. this definitely qualifies.

had an Americano. very bold and pretty smooth. came in around 10a during on a weekday. moderately crowded, but pretty good set-up for working.

wi-fi was totally fine. 

so overall the coffee was good and the place/people were fine and totally unremarkable. not sure what the fuss is about either way."}
{"text":"Not my favorite coffee,
I have had coffee all over the world.
And have never had something taste so acidic, and burnt.
It's hard to screw up a latte or even a mocha, yet both times they have not been right. 
Barrista's are too busy chatting and texting to acknowledge  the  customers.
Extremely hyped up for sour and bitter tasting coffee 
I shall not make it a third time .
Usally 3 strikes and your out, sadly not this time 2 times was enough, 
Plenty of other places to go for better coffee and much friendlier Barrista's."}
{"text":"An excellent change of pace from your normal Starbucks in the airport. The cost is A little higher than most coffee shops in the airport it it seems to be a bit more upscale. 

I just got an americano and it was great.

Need a wake up call...this is a good spot to get your fix. 

Also have several delicious pastry options."}
{"text":"Definitely hipster... trendy.... good lattes?  Hell yeah!!

Walked in today and ordered a hot small (still a double shot) latte with half&half... the first sip really blew me away!  Can't say I've had one this good since this little cafe in Cordoba, Spain.

The gal at the register was friendly and helped me pick between half&half and soymilk.. 

I liked their simple syrup pump... didn't like that they had no cinnamon/nutmeg shakers because I love that in my lattes.. but glad I didn't pervert what is to be (so far) the best US latte I've ever had.  Damn, I wish I lived closer.

Place was hard to find and, yeah, no prices... and if you're not a hipster, you really do get noticed and stand out."}
{"text":"So very Portlandia in its hipsterness and decor. Premium coffee roasted in-house, in the middle of the desert, no less! Who would have thunk it.

Baristas were profesh and friendly. They even warmed up our pastries upon request. Perfectly foamed milk and fruity noted espresso. I hope this place has a long life in Scottsdale, where great coffee is few and far between."}
{"text":"I am a major fan of your coffee. Enough said on this. 

I am less of a fan of your customer service- I would rather a smile from the cashier instead of some ironic stare.... but it's a pass.

I am requesting that you bring back non-sweet/sugar-filled baked goods. Such as croissants or toast. 

Some of us (the public) can't have sugar. Others of us choose not to ingest sugar filled muffins, cakes, and scones with our coffee. Please stock your store with an alternative that is not a packaged granola bar.

That is my feedback. 

Again- You do coffee well! Maybe I'll be forced to get a snack elsewhere."}
{"text":"Cartel has great products and I've never been disappointed with any of their drinks. However, it may take a half hour to get it. I know they are completely different from a place like Starbucks, but when there's 5 or 6 people in line at Cartel, it will absolutely take 20 minutes to get your drink, which is absurd and ridiculous. A place like Sbux would take 5 minutes. Let's give Cartel the benefit of the doubt with their solo machine and manual tamping. Even if you triple the time, you're still waiting longer at Cartel. Never go there if you are in a hurry. If my drink was ready just minutes after I order it, I'd be giving them 5 stars. Since they ALWAYS take forever, they get 3, it's that tough. Their drinks are delicious and I'm sad I don't go there often but it's not worth a 20 minute wait."}
{"text":"- - Rudest Service ever
+ Good Coffee


I swung by for a cappuccino during a short work break. I work in the area and read the great reviews. I got some of the most over-the-top unjustifiably RUDE service experience at a coffee shop I've ever had. I walked in, waited in line, ordered just a cappuccino, left a tip and, waited at the bar for the woman to finish making my cappuccino. She poured it into a ceramic mug -- and she did a really beautiful pour that looked great. 

\"Oh, could I actually get that to go?\" I asked with a Midwestern twang.
\"No, we don't do cappuccinos to go. We do lattes to go\" she retorted.
...a short pause....
\"Oh, ok, well, could you just pour it in a cup\" I said trying to figure out how I can drink my coffee without gulping it down quick so I can get back to work. 
\"No, we don't do that because of standards and stuff\" she retorted.
... another short pause as I stood flabbergasted...
\"I can get a cup for you and you can pour it in yourself\" she interjected, mustering a few shreds of customer service.

Look, I get it, you want to maintain your hipster cred. You did a beautiful pour and re-pouring it in a paper cup will wreak that. I'm not a picky jerk of a customer, I tip, I'm not even mad about pouring my own drink in a cup: I'm mad because you could have at least been nice about it by saying something like \"Oh, we usually don't do that, I can grab a cup for you, but next time I recommend you order a latte\". I've been a regular at small independent coffee shops my whole life and have never encountered someone so un-willing to pour a cappuccino in a to-go cup. I think I'll rather go to... Starbucks... over this place. I hate Starbucks but at least they don't treat customers like complete trash for no reason."}
{"text":"I travel a ton, and try to find unique local coffee shops wherever I'm at. I've had Cartel at PHX airport and think they have great coffee, so I figured I'd give this location a try.

Bottom line: Great vibe, great coffee, great service. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I don't like coffee very much, but I LOVED their mocha.  When we arrived there was a piano player and a guitar player jamming out, plus there was great outdoor seating if you wanted to get away from that.  It was so much fun."}
{"text":"Very good! loved my iced mocha and Chorizo burrito! just a bad combo. lol
I will be comic back here very soon! only complaint was costumer service..."}
{"text":"Every time I go to the coffee shop I try their cold brew and theirs is so smooth and full of flavor! And I love how they have simple syrup and cream at the bar to allow you to customize your drink to your palette. The atmosphere in here is great for meeting with friends, studying, or just a place to rest and have a good cup of coffee! You can even see them roasting their beans inside and if you don't know what to order the staff is super friendly and explains everything to you."}
{"text":"Really nice and cozy environment with friendly staff and great house music. Sat here awhile to stay out of the heat. Oh yeah, a great Cup of Joe too!"}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this place.   Best coffee shop ever hands down!! I had a mocha and it was so creamy and delightful.  They even made a foam heart on top.   My only disappointment was that they were closed when I arrived back in Phx.  I am definitely going to one of their other locations soon!"}
{"text":"I was here tonight for the first time and loved it! The ambiance is so much better than the Tempe location (which I love too). The tea I got was amazing, the staff were friendly, and they serve alcohol too. Will definitely be back to this lovely spot!"}
{"text":"This place suffers from an identity crisis. Is it a coffee house, lounge, restaurant, bakery, bike shop, etc.?   Didn't care for this place at all. The coffee was bitter. Walking in for the first time, I couldn't tell how this place functioned. Do you order at the counter or tables? Where is the cream and sweetener for the coffee? In fact, what is that in the unlabeled bottle? Oh, liquid sugar you say after I have to ask. Label it why don't you?!! I asks for cream because the cream container was empty, the worker says ok and continues to drink her coffee. I had to asks another worker for cream. He tells me it's in the empty container. Pretty bad customer service for a $5 cup of bitter coffee.  The food is terrible. Eggs that look like rocks and under-cooked potatoes! When I ordered hash browns, the worker says they don't have hash browns, only potatoes! Last time I checked, hash browns are potatoes!"}
{"text":"Coffee done right can instantly change my mood.  The last few times, they haven't disappointed. They took the time to describe what pour over and aeropress beans were available and offer suggestions. Good coffee and good people."}
{"text":"This is the pinnacle of quality coffee in AZ. Cartel introduced me to the complexity of flavors in those coffee beans and taught me coffee shouldn't have an over-roasted, stale, and scorched flavor. Ever since that first cup of Santa Julia I've been hooked! (hope the Santa Julia comes back -_-) My favorite coffee now though is the Atitlan. 

They roast coffee in house and brew your coffee by the cup. They brew with the aeropress, v60, chemex and clever depending on how much coffee you want. You should definitely purchase whole bean and be brewing their beans at home too! If espresso is your thing, they also do that really well. I'm not really an espresso guy but there's is very good. Also, lattes and cappuccinos are amazing. Perfect balance of milk and espresso. That goes for the mocha too, the chocolate makes the drink sweet without overpowering the espresso.

As far as ambiance goes, it's a bit loud. They have the music louder than most coffee shops so if you need peace and quiet than this may not be the place for you. I still manage to get work done here all the time but it's not the most peaceful environment. If you're here to socialize, however, Cartel is your place! Cartel also makes their own beer now and brews tea as well. I'm not very experienced with craft beer though so I will let you judge how good theirs are. I've had one green tea here and it was delicious. I'm not very knowledgable about tea either so I'll leave that to you guys.

I've tried a bunch of places around Scottsdale because that's where I live and they all fall short. Press Coffee in Scottsdale makes great coffee equally as good. But their lattes and cappuccinos are...the same drink. It frustrates me to have a cappuccino that has way too much milk in it. Tastes like I'm drinking steamed whole milk...actually. Altitude Coffee Lab is a brand new coffee shop in Scottsdale and also makes great fresh coffee and roasts in house. The problem is that they don't brew by the cup. I can find places that come close to Cartel, but they all fall short! Cartel needs a North Scottsdale location.

Anyway, if you're on the fence about it, get your butt down to Cartel and have some delicious coffee! No one does it better!"}
{"text":"The best coffee Arizona has to offer!

Cartel Coffee Lab does it all. They send their roaster down to South/Central America to source great coffee, they roast coffee themselves in Tempe, AZ and they brew the coffee in a way that respects the chemistry of the bean and ensures the resulting cup is of the highest quality. Other AZ cafes come close, often offering great cups of coffee, but none are as involved in the process from farm to cup as Cartel is! Trust me, you, the customer, are the beneficiary of all their crazy coffee worship.

Cartel also has several cafes that all have their own unique personality. This 5th Ave location in Old Town is one of the friendliest, most welcoming and relaxing of their cafes. Great place to get work done and the baristas seem to cater to the crowd in setting the ambiance. If everyone's in with friends getting (alcoholic) beverages then the music will be turned up a bit and more upbeat, if everyone's got their laptops out or their nose buried in a book the music will be a bit more calm. 

My favorite drinks are any of their hand-brewed coffees, the cappuccino, the cortado and the one-and-one (ask your barista!).

Oh, and I could rant for an hour about why complaints about price are irrational but i'll keep it short. Coffee is an agricultural product that requires an ENORMOUS amount of work to grow and process. If you take a second to think about where your coffee comes from and all the hands that work to bring it to you, you'll wonder why each cup doesn't cost $10 and each bag doesn't cost $50!"}
{"text":"$4 for a black coffee -and I even brought my own mug?! That's robbery. Had I known I would have gotten a cappuccino as it's the same price but much more labor intensive. I don't understand this pricing scheme at all."}
{"text":"This place is very nice with nice seating options. I like the workstation tables when you can study, or simply work on your laptop or tablet. The coffee tastes very good and fresh. 

The only problem is the wifi. It didn't work for me on neither my laptop, nor my smart phone.  I even tried a tablet but didn't work neither.  I asked the guys working there, someone told me he would check on that but never got back to me neither did the Internet work. 

I would've given this place 5 stars of the Internet worked."}
{"text":"No hands down, the best espresso in the greater Phoenix area. Talented and passionate baristas (albeit strange sometimes), simple and direct menu, and no bullshit. In-house roasted coffee beans at the most premium quality. Almost always perfect cappuccinos (in house only, the way it should be), locally brewed Chai from Tucson, and organic/fair trade ingredients. A must for real coffee-lovers."}
{"text":"Located downtown and a few minutes away from our hotel. I ordered the soy latte and it was good. Service was friendly and they were helpful when I asked for options for those lactose intolerant."}
{"text":"Single shot of expresso -fucking crazy.  Soo good and strong.  Nothing Starbucks about the flavor.  Explaining the tier system in regards to the sale of pounds of coffee was sort of confusing.  But, I bet the coffee is worth it  judging by the expresso I had.  

I'm not hungry anymore."}
{"text":"Looooove this place! 
Great atmosphere. AMAZING cold brew... and I drink it black. 
Suuuch a cool place to meet up and do homework!
The people are awesome. Very helpful and not \"barista snobs\" like other worth while coffee places. 

A heads up: the parking directly adjacent to the cafe is STRICT one hour parking. And there's a very diligent little parking man who stalks you like a hawk to time you. Be warned."}
{"text":"Had to leave without picking up my coffee after their slow as hell barista took 10+ minutes to make 4 drinks.  My flight was early boarding so I asked for an ETA and he gave this \"I'll get to it when I get to it\" attitude.  

The girl at the counter was flippant as well. I don't care if the person at the counter can't spell my name, but after I tell you how it's spelled letter for letter, get it right.  *My name is a very common one so misspelling it proves your an idiot.*

I'm always trying to support smaller businesses, but screw this place, I won't be going back.

Starbucks might be a large chain but at least their baristas and front counter people act like they give a rats ass about their jobs."}
{"text":"Ride your bike here and relax. The wifi is a bit spotty and a little slow, they make up for it with great service and amazing coffee."}
{"text":"I've lived in some very coffee-centric places in the world (SF, LA, Boston, overseas) and this is a good place to grab some espresso in Scottsdale. The baristas are super friendly and funny, a nice change from the exceedingly pretentious coffee-slingers of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Decor is a nice blend of retro and modern, music can be a bit deafening."}
{"text":"Always great people, service, and beverages at Cartel! (Wish their chairs were more comfortable... these are hard, steel little things!). ;)"}
{"text":"Solid service, great atmosphere, great coffee!

Highly recommended if you want to kick back and catch up with a friend, get some work done, or looking for a low key date spot."}
{"text":"Well.. once again I trusted you dang Yelpers and once again you've proven yourselves worthy of that trust.  I'm sitting here in Cartel now just loving the smell of roasting coffee, the ambience, the music and one heckava cup of joe..I'll be back...my kinda place.."}
{"text":"Some of the best tasting salads and sandwiches in downtown Phoenix.  Freshest ingredients and completely original flavor combinations.  Baked goods also offer something special, that home made flavor and texture.  There is always an array of hearty cookie choices to choose from.  Nice informal atmosphere, mix of students and office workers.  A little sidewalk seating if you're so inclined.  Others have already raved about the drinks so I don't need to here.  If you are interested in supporting locally owned businesses that are offering something special, go here.  It is surprising how many downtown regulars do not know of this little gem when you mention it, but that will change based on Cartel's great offerings."}
{"text":"Pretty noisy here which was a challenge for my casual coffee meeting. Lots of people on laptops and a pretty hip environment near the university. The cold brew was above average but would have liked to have gotten a better description of their cold brew options as their cashier didn't seem very knowledgeable about their offerings since I'm don't do cold brew that often. Maybe next time will a different experience."}
{"text":"Great coffee and a new joint on the corner now. A light bitter coffee but it definitely beats Starbucks, hands down."}
{"text":"They put a lot of love into their coffee making! Hands down the best coffee! I came here and enjoyed the chai and mocha lattes each day I was in Scottsdale. I will miss my morning pick me up and friendly service now that I am back home."}
{"text":"Pissy customer service followed by the worst cold brew coffee I've ever had. 

Never wanted a refund more. 

Of course it's airport so travelers always get the worst at the highest prices."}
{"text":"The coffee is full and rewarding. Yet, I can make just as good. When I frequent a coffee shop I demand service. The two times I frequented (I use that term loosely because I will not frequent again)  at Cartel, I was served arrogance and conceit."}
{"text":"If the biggest coffee geek on the planet had a basement to himself, this is what he would create -- a lab, indeed. The coffee experts can get their rocks off on all the high tech brewing equipment, and the single-origin coffee, and food pairings, and what have you. 

On the other hand, the dilettantes and casual coffee enjoyers can get an excellent brew, without too much condescension. Yes, you will get a cocked eyebrow and a gentle suggestion that you pass on the cream, or other additives. 

But there is no sneering, and you will get your accoutrements if you ask for them. And you will have to ask, since they are stashed out of sight.

All is all, it's a cozy little lab to get your coffee geek on, no matter what end of the spectrum you hail from."}
{"text":"This business recently changed names from Sola Coffee Bar to Cartel Coffee Lab. I loved it before, so now with the expanded hours and menu, I expect it will be just as good or better!

Before changing names, I heard Sola already brewed with Cartel's beans, so today when I tried the coffee, I wasn't surprised that it tasted about the same: not overly strong, but delicious."}
{"text":"cool atmosphere. delicious strong lattes!"}
{"text":"My main complaint before was lack of seating, but with the recent expansion even that small issue has been fixed. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Cartel is a little hidden gem! I never knew exactly where it was but since I've gone my BF and I are hooked! Defiantly a place to check if you're a big coffee drinker! Parking is limited however I'm usually always able to snag a spot! Lots of tables and spots available to bring your computer and do work! The only down side is the coffee options are a bit limited however, they have the staples and you're drink will always be legit ( they weigh out the beans etc)."}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem in the valley. It looks like a small little shop from the outside but when you enter you're greeted by the amazing smell of coffee and much much more room then you couldve ever imagined. The coffee itself is amazing and the staff is awesome. I'll never go to Starbucks again!"}
{"text":"The best chai you'll ever have. The drinks are always great and the staff is friendly. Only four stars because I dirty chai will run you 8 bucks and sometimes you wait upwards of 10 Minutes for your drink. I keep going back because this place make quality coffee drinks"}
{"text":"5 star coffee/service help and knowledge, 4 star ambiance, 2 star food.

As I understand, the \"cool\" coffee shop scene and options are lacking in Phoenix relative to my home in Denver. But this place has it. They take their coffee seriously and understand it well. Barista was friendly, helpful, and informative. The coffee was excellent (had the Puerto Verte). All are medium to light roasted. The slower speed of service seemed to be a product of brewing to order. 

The breakfast sandwich was good but pricey for what you got. It also had meat in the egg patty (which was not advertised on the menu). And NO condiments (salt, pepper, ketchup, hot sauce, etc). WTF?"}
{"text":"This coffee snob is WAY impressed. 
Delicious brew. Nice presentation. Staff was informed about the business, which is great for an airport location."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars. I liked the vibe of this place and feel like I could definitely get some work done here. This place is pretty big for a coffee shop, and there's a lot of seating. I had a cold brew coffee which was fine. It wasn't bad, and it wasn't delicious. The girl who took my order was fine too. She wasn't overly friendly or helpful, but she wasn't rude. My main issues are with the condiments bar and the bathrooms. I went to doctor up my coffee, and the milk was in one place and everything else in another. The cream was just sitting at the bar where you pick up your coffee in random unmarked containers. You have to ask what's what, and it's just kind of a chaotic mess that seems like a temporary solution. Then if you want a lid, straw or stirrer for your cream or any sugar it's hidden around the corner. They didn't have many options for sugar, and again this area was cluttered. Finally got everything I needed and sat down and then I had to go looking for the wifi password. I went to the restroom a little later, and it was just scary in there. Eww. I feel like this place thinks since it's dark in there, it doesn't have to be clean. I think they need a giant makeover. Coffee shops can be independent and trendy without looking like a dingy basement."}
{"text":"Since I had some poor customer service experiences at Cartel, they've really made an effort to improve. There is still some snark, but I haven't seen any rudeness in a long time. They're making a definite effort to educate or work with customers.

Their coffee has always been top notch, and if they continue to develop the service side of the equation they are going to be solidly one of the best coffee shops in town."}
{"text":"I have been traveling to the Phoenix area somewhat regularly (for both family and business visits) for about 15 years.  The coffee I found there never failed to disappoint, until..... I  visited your Old Town Scottsdale shop this past weekend.  Wow!  Finally there is really good coffee in Arizona!  Your shop is great, and the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable.  Your espresso is right up there with the best in Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco.  Congratulations and thank you!"}
{"text":"Iced coffee Americana was awful. Almost $5 and after a few sips I tossed it. This is second bad experience at cartel. Last time it was the mocha coffee. I miss Starbucks."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here since they were just local roasters who wanted to make some drinks on the side. The coffee is excellent, they will occasionally throw out your drink and make it again if the expresso looks off. The staff is helpful, thoroughly competent but a bit snobby, as hipsters tend to be. Who cares, this is the best coffee in phoenix!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy this location exists! I am a die-hard fan of Cartel's black market espresso for my home machine, and it's easy to get my fix here since we find ourselves in old town on a regular basis.

We buy 3 bags at a time since they comp our drinks with the purchase. I always get a toddy to go, and I love the simple syrup pump they have out because I can quickly sweeten my drink.  

The staff is pretty nice and polite, no attitudes detected here. One server even took the time to explain different techniques to make iced coffee when I asked about some of their equipment.

The coffee itself is my absolute favorite. It's smooth while still providing a good caffeine kick. It has comletely ruined us. It's not cheap, but I justify the splurge since my morning cappuccinos are what gets me out of bed in the morning."}
{"text":"Always perfect... friendly staff that makes you wanna hang around and chat. Wish they had some outside seating for this time of year."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, but they closed their espresso machine a half hour before closing. So unprofessional. Unreal. Never go here."}
{"text":"I have been to every coffee place in Scottsdale, I am not exaggerating - Literally every one. I only ever get straight black coffee. Cartel has the best. Places like Sip use Cartel Coffee but for whatever reason I like it best at Cartel. If you want the best coffee in town go to Cartel. However,  Cartel lacks friendly staff.

I am a very easy going person, not a lot of things bother me, and really the employees do not bother me all that much, but enough to write this review. I have had this conversation with many different people, and we have all agreed - the Scottsdale Cartel employees are aloof and dismissive. I am not sure if this comes from management? I know Abercrombie used to tell its employees to act aloof, so to add to its brand culture. I know that Cartel offers a premium product in terms of coffee, so it does appeal to a certain crowd. There is nothing wrong with that at all, that is why we have brands like BMW, and Prada - people like nice things. 

People also like to be treated nice. I have been to a lot of coffee shops in my life, and the ones that stand out in my mind aren't always the ones with exceptional coffee (that certainly helps), but the ones that have an open, comfortable, home-like vibe. Cartel is not like that - I think it starts with the employees. I have on more than one occasion said \"how are you?\" or \"have a nice day\" only to be ignored. It is the weirdest thing. 

I write this review not to criticize, but to critique. I feel somewhat alienated when I go into Cartel, it is a shame because it is close to where I live and work, and I really like the coffee, but out of principal I often avoid it."}
{"text":"Awesome, hidden gem in Tempe. If you are trying to escape the starbucks nation, go to cartel coffee lab. The iced coffee was especially refreshing."}
{"text":"The coffee here is outta this world!!! Been coming here for years and it's definitely my favorite coffee shop ever. Their cappuccino is so strong and perfect, lattes are great, cold brew is delicious, and their chai is amazing. Finally a place where the baristas do their jobs with such integrity, they are wizards. If you want quality, come here. The beans they sell are sourced from small scale farmers, which I appreciate, but can't afford. Lots of space with their expansions and lots of outlets. Sometimes the music is a bit too crazy, but that's just me. Bring headphones and you're set.
Many people hate on cartel for the 'too cool' vibe and perceived attitude that some baristas have, but I've found that if I am kind to them, they are kind back! Just my experience, but I wouldn't worry about it too much. Last time I was here I saw the most beautiful doggo ever and if you're lucky maybe you'll see him, he's big and fluffy and all black. Cross your fingers."}
{"text":"Boring Sunday and a sweet tooth hits so I end up at Cartel looking for cookies. They have three varieties and somehow due to miscommunication I wound up with all three varieties. The three cookies were placed in individual brown bags which all ended up looking like they contained a bag of french fries. Are cookies supposed to be that greasy to seep through the bag? The peanut butter version with peanut butter icing was below average, the cranberry/white chocolate variety was equally bad and the winner was the one that looked like an Oreo. Iced Mocha features get your own lid at this location, but not the best version in town."}
{"text":"Very good coffee, nice foam. Happy to have a place to leave my husband while I shop. There are power strips under the table and it seems like some people work from this coffee shop. Nice relaxed vibe, feels like the mission in SF."}
{"text":"I had a delicious latte here. They say they have the best espresso maker in town, and it's kind of hard to argue. This place is hipster supreme to the max and way better than any other coffeehouse in Tempe (sorry, Gold Bar, I've betrayed you). 

My favorite thing about Cartel (besides the strong brew, of course)? They play damn good tunes all the time. There's no better soundtrack in the Valley. They also have art for sale that's actually affordable (and usually quite interesting). And people are nice here... what a concept. I'm glad they're into the green movement using \"plastic\" cups made of 100% corn. Downside: I wish they had longer hours and more comfy chairs. Those plastic fold-up chairs really suck compared to the comfy couches."}
{"text":"This place seriously has the best coffee, lattes, hot chocolate and chai tea i've ever had, period!

I was visiting my brother and he insisted on taking me here, to which I replied, I only drink hot chocolate, no coffee or tea. Well, did i eat or should i say drink those words.

We ordered a latte, chai tea and hot chocolate and i was singing their praises all the way home. This is not an ordinary coffee shop - all three drinks were rich, creamy and had wonderful flavors - i was completely blown away!

If i lived here, i'd definitely be a coffee and chai tea drinker, but sadly i don't - though this place is on my \"must visit\" list next time i'm in town."}
{"text":"I go to school downtown and I need a mid-day coffee fix at least two or three times per week.  Cartel is conveniently located a block away from my school, so it would seem to be a good choice.

I will give them credit where credit is due... the vanilla nonfat latte was pretty good. I would definitely order it again if I were to go back.

But I will absolutely not be going back.  In fact, let me preface this comment by saying that I have actually never written a yelp review before, but my experience at Cartel was so horrible, that I decided to open an account to share my opinion about this place with others.  I have never encountered such appallingly rude and just downright nasty barristas.  I went in with a few friends from class and we all left feeling similarly disrespected.  The girl who took our orders had long dark hair and was super skinny... What is her deal?? Did your dog just die or something? Would it kill you to show even a hint or smile or to just pretend to be deriving some pleasure from working at Cartel? After my friends and I got our drinks, we hung out for a little while and talked, but when it was time to head back to class, one of my friends had not finished her drink yet, so she asked a barrista for a to-go cup.  After asking, the barrista looked at her and essentially rolled her eyes, appalled that someone would ask her to do such a demanding and burdensome task.

I have worked in a restaurant. I know what it is like to work in this type of industry.  I am always respectful of servers and people who take my orders, and I will give them very hefty tips if I feel like they are genuine and if they are doing their best to take care of me.  However, when people are as disrespectful as these young ladies, it makes me not want to go back to that establishment and give them my money.  These two girls were so incredibly impolite, unwelcoming, and unpleasant (agreed upon by the other three ladies I was with and myself) that I will not be going back to Cartel.

If you're downtown and you want great drinks and pastries, accompanied by fantastic service, go to One Coffee at Washington and Central.  The staff that works there is phenomenal and they're always happy and eager to help.  Polar opposites from the girls I encountered at Cartel."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Phoenix. Period.  Likely the the best in Arizona, and perhaps one of the best in the US.  Lofty claims, yes, but in all my travels I've found very few places that serve coffee on this level. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The BEST cappuccino I've had in a long time, and it happened to be at Phoenix Airport!!

Did you know that Cartel Coffee Lab...
--1. is local company founded in Tempe Arizona (six location to serve you and growing)
--2. Jason Silberschlag, is the owner of Cartel Coffee Lab, and a native of Tucson and also a University of Arizona alumni.
--3. Cartel Coffee Lab roast their own coffee beans
--4. there is no take out so you have to sit and enjoy your espresso and cappuccino, just like the Italians in Italy. LOL :p (good way to catch up on your Yelping while enjoying your favorite beverage).
--5. Their pastries.... oh my, I recommend their Banana Bread, it was just fantastic.
--6. Best of the best, excellent customer service!!

Cartel Coffee Lab was \"named\" 1 of 9 BEST COFFEE in the USA!!  I believe it.  Checkout the interview with owner Jason at Arizona Daily Wildcat: http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu/article/2014/01/qa-cartel-coffee-lab-owner-jason-silberschlag

Until then, Cheers! ~ :p"}
{"text":"Cartel coffee is my favorite coffee bar none. I usually get my coffee to go and don't hang out, but the ambiance in the place is very good. Exactly what I would hope for in a coffee shop. I love ever coffee drink they serve. From dirty chai to just a plain black cup of coffee, I'm in love with it all."}
{"text":"Probably the least busy of the Cartel Coffee I've been too. I LOVE the coffee here. Cartel always gives high quality coffee no matter how you order it. Also this spot in downtown Phoenix is prime for people watching, especially around comic con time in the summer."}
{"text":"Great coffee so far at the 2 locations I've visited. Hipster haven lol, better have a MacBook."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, well made coffee with a great variety of not only coffee, but ways to make it."}
{"text":"This place is really cool. Good coffee, the staff was nice, and my coffee cake was good. It's super cool that they also have a handful of beers on tap, one of them, Mr. Pineapple, had me drooling- it looked so good.

The ambiance is really cool and comfortable and looks like a great place to sit and chill. It would be cool if they had a few more baked goods for morning grab and goes, but there is only so much space.

Cartel is yet another great reason to support local coffee, skip the chains- and enjoy."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best coffee slash coffee experience I have ever had in an airport.  It felt like a little oasis with prime people watching in a busy terminal with baristas that are kind and care about the process.

Let's talk about the process. I have magnificent friends who are supreme baristas because they love the process. It's quite evident here that the all of the people and products here are dedicated to the process of creating quality. Come here for a drink made with intention and enjoy every sip.

I ordered a cappuccino. It was perfectly made with just the right amount of flavor and foam on top. One of the best parts was I enjoyed it from a real coffee cup - not a to-go one. 

This is one of those places where I will intentionally be early for my flight so I can spend time here!"}
{"text":"We go to Arizona every year to visit family but this is the first time we \"reached out\" to find out where the good coffee lives. A local told us about Cartel, which was located on Memory Lane for my wife, so it was easy to find (\"just past where I used to drink a giant soda before working at the vintage clothing store and or record store.\") . It seemed like we were going to someone's apartment, but behind the door, shockingly enough, was a comfortable coffee shop with easily the best drip coffee I've had during six Christmas trips to The Zona. I bought a bag of beans to take back and the gentleman told me \"19$ a bag...and worth every penny.\" I just made a cup in Oakland, CA and I have to agree. My one qualm: their incredibly nice and comfortable t-shirts accentuate my man boobs."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee and staff who are both knowledgeable and patient. If you come at a peak time, be prepared to wait in line for a while, and to bump elbows with strangers at a table. Hands down my favorite cold coffee in Arizona."}
{"text":"I actually stopped in here twice on Monday: once for an iced chai latte and again later to try one of the house coffees (el bosque). Both were excellent! Service was super good; the baristas were vey friendly and even brought my coffee out to me! I can tell this place is a quick stop for people traveling in and out of the downtown area, so I wish I had went to one of the more loungier spots. Would definitely check out another location on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today to sample some of their brewery offerings since it was near where I was staying. Sat at the bar and tried the 5 beers on tap, then ordered 2 10oz pours of 2 of them. 

Had a pretty good time here, the place is actually rather spacious once you get inside and had plenty of seating options. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The beers themselves were kind of hit or miss, I had higher hopes for the brown ale since it featured their coffee but it was rather \"odd\". A weird kind of hoppy bitterness that I didn't really expect at all. APA and Pale Ale were so so but I did rather enjoy the DIPA, and the grapefuit wit wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"In PHX. In Terminal 4, C Terminal (Southwest Airlines). Very fru-fru. They do Aero-Press coffee! I'm impressed. It's the first time I've seen an Aero-Press used in a commercial shop. They also do expresso and Chemex. Worth the walk and the wait for a good cup of coffee."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if your looking for an outstanding cup of gourmet coffee. The staff is seriously knowledgable about the entire process and will gladly give you an information overload if you ask, even if they do so with a hipster poise (it doesn't really bother me when they have some useful nuggets of knowledge to back up their hipness).

Local artists regularly grace the walls with their artwork and you will always find a variety of artists, designers, developers, and general hip folk typing away on their respective mac book pros.

Haters gonna hate, but I love this place. Truly original."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. Rich frothy crema on top of my espresso drink with a pretty design!  Service was friendly and very accommodating. They carried out our order and anticipated our needs, bringing dishes and extra utensils. Super cool environment with inside and out seating, wifi was free and restrooms were clean and easily accessible."}
{"text":"Really nice set up. Great coffee, great service, understated and interesting layout. Almost a conservative industrial interior decoration with artistic and contemporary sensibilities. Interesting choice of art displays that reflect the feeling of the overall scene. All the staff I have encountered are very friendly with genuine personalities. I look forward to making at least one trip back before my conference ends, and will surely be back again next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is pretty dope. They have beer, and coffee how could you go wrong right?!? 
It's located in old town, so day dependent parking can be a challenge. 
They have a lot of space to sit down and work, or make calls. 
They only have two size cups. I believe it's 8oz and 16oz, but don't bite my head off of those aren't the exact sizes but two sizes regardless. 
Place has a little bit of a hipster vibe, and they definitely take their time making the coffee. I know a great latte is worth a bit of a wait but this wait (with no one ahead of me) was overly long. So I wouldn't go there if i was rushing to work but I would certainly head over on a casual Saturday or a late start day."}
{"text":"Really cool spot, good beer, cool vibe, Hipster feel,  Good place to hang with friends or study.  Different rooms have a different setting, so it can be social or quieter."}
{"text":"Very cute area and place.  Cleverly designed.  Nice staff.  Cool, hip vibe.  Good chocolate chip cookie.  But, the main reason for my visit was to have my favorite drink I test everywhere - the mocha.  Unfortunately, it disappointed.  A bit bitter, not a smooth mocha.  It was actually the 3rd bad mocha I got trying different independent cafes in the Phoenix area over my vacation.  Maybe Phoenix just isn't a mocha town.  I'd probably go back and try a different drink."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in AZ, wish they would come out to Dallas!!! They've grown a lot in their locations and I even found them in the Airport! They have the best iced chai and iced coffee around. Everything is done to perfection to provide only the best coffee experience. As a proclaimed coffee expert, this is where my love for the \"real deal\" began- at their Tempe location about 5yrs ago :)"}
{"text":"Located in Old Town on a street with unique stores. The \"lab\" was trendy and had a hipster feel. The guy with the samurai man-bun took my order and did a phenomenal job explaining to me all the fancy coffee on their menu. I ended up with the simple mocha which came with an awesome latte art. The taste was not all that exceptional and it didn't give me an energy surge like my usual black coffee. I'll have to go back and try some of their other more unique options under \"filter\" and espresso. Overall, it was a good alternative if you don't want boring ol' Starbucks. It can be a little pricey, $5 ish for a large mocha."}
{"text":"Fairly 'Boh Chic' yet a simple and inviting environment for superior coffee in many ways. We stopped by after sad restaurant brew and were elated. Came back 2nd day passing the drip pots w/ single origin washed varietals and waited for a pour-over. 
Excellent.
This wet wash process takes full advantage of  flavors otherwise discarded in the other methods. Fruit flavors like strawberry, watermelon, or other light aromatics is not your typical canned bean experience.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I enjoy trying coffee at different coffee shops. Since I was visiting the Tempe area I thought I would try the cold brew at Cartel. I'm on a hunt for a really good (Nitro) Cold Brew! I didn't really enjoy the cold brew from Cartel. The cold brew was bitter and put on ice. After some of the ice melted, it was tolerable.
As soon as I received my coffee, the cashier turned around and went behind the wall to play on his phone. First time in the coffee shop and I had to search for the location where the lids and other condiments were located."}
{"text":"The \"meh, I've experienced better\" tag to 3 stars perfectly explains how I feel about Cartel. I don't understand the hype behind this coffee 'lab'.

I was walking around downtown Phoenix, and I passed Cartel enough that I thought it may offer the perfect pick me up to get through the day. A three hour time difference isn't a huge deal, but when you inadvertently wake up at 6am every morning because that's what you're used to, a coffee is always welcomed. 

Cartel is a no-frills, to the point shop tucked away in an office building. I was kind of bummed that there was no outdoor seating area, as my goal was to sit and enjoy the weather until I needed to pick my friend up from work. I yelped before buying because I was hoping there was another coffee shop around that had an outdoor patio for me to hang out on. Oddly enough, Cartel seems to have put some monopoly of some sort as I couldn't find anything similar in the surrounding area. I was shocked considering I was in the middle of the metro. Defeated, I decided I'd buy a cup and continue walking around downtown. 

I wanted a cappuccino, but I guess they do it the \"proper\" way, which means that you get a tiny ass cup 'as that's how they do it in Italy.' Ah, okay. This isn't what I thought I was signing up for, but okay. The employees aren't pretentious, but they mean business when it comes to coffee. There are no cutesy snacks to dip. There are no seats to waste your day away. This is a \"I'm going to give you what I believe coffee should be and nothing else\" type of place.

As I said, eh, I've experienced better is the perfect explanation for Cartel. Maybe my palette isn't refined enough to drink this. Or maybe I dodged a bullet by swearing to not come back."}
{"text":"Went for Mothers Day! Pretty cool place, but I'm more of a hoity toity coffee drinker- certainly not foofoo enough for me! Got the iced black tea and it was delicious"}
{"text":"hipster vibe seems cool, until you open the doors and you're instantly hit with wofting smells of bo and petula oil. every one in sync looks up from their macbook pro's as you walk in, strutting down the \"why are you here in the middle of the day on your macbook pro\" runway towards the cash register. from the two androgynous people behind the ipad, you order an overpriced coffee (iced because az is so freaking hot). it tastes like its a hipster sock steeped in warm water taken straight from the canal, heated in the beating tempe sun. this might be your scene, though!"}
{"text":"Always seeking good espresso when traveling and Cartel was worth seeking out. 

Friendly staff and smooth cortado!

Worth checking out if in Old Town."}
{"text":"There is a good reason why this place doesn't post their prices: it's because if they did, most folks would walk right out. This is the first place ever that makes Starbucks seem inexpensive. They have only 2 sizes of drinks, a tiny 8 oz and one that is probably 12 oz. Originally I wanted a Mocha and that was going to be 5 bucks (before tax), so i switched to a regular coffee which costs almost 4 bucks for the 12 oz size. That was my que to laugh this place off as a joke, especially in a college town, and head over to Circle K, where there were 12 choices of coffee waiting, all for under 2 bucks. ASU college kids must have more of daddy's money because nobody was buying $5 cups of coffee back in the good ole days.  No outdoor seating either."}
{"text":"Artsy farts he trendy style semi hit and location with a hipster type crowd/college/work on your computer crowd. In the University area. The drinks are actually pretty good. The banana bread was really good. I would totally come back here good stuff."}
{"text":"Simply put, Cartel Coffee Lab is the vanguard of coffee shops.  This is a scaled down, bare-bones shop that has a limited drink menu, for which I am thankful.  If you are looking for a frappuccino, or some kind of blended fruit concoction, this is not the place for you; the Cartel owners are true to the coffee bean, and they are not interested in manipulating or mutilating it.

Things I love about the Cartel: The chill atmosphere, the super-friendly staff, the premium coffee (obviously), and the independent feel of the place.  

Side note: This is not a coffee shop built around the whims of commuters who are in a rush to get to work.  They take great care at Cartel to make a great cup of coffee, which means that it might take a few minutes to get your order."}
{"text":"Trotted into Cartel because I always like to hit a local coffee spot at every major city I visit. 
Love the minimalist modern bike decor and how large the location is. 
I asked the barista to wildcard it for me and just pick something without letting me know what it was. Got a fantastic cold brew coffee that was complex and acidic which I drank without a sweetener.
Great spot, and good coffee."}
{"text":"Excellent espresso and cappuccino. The service and environment is awesome! Super friendly staff & are pet friendly. We took our Irish setters without issues & the staff was super welcoming!"}
{"text":"It's the best coffee I've had in Arizona and if you are ever in Sky Harbor they have a location there also. Coffee this good at an airport is unheard of even in this day and age. The PHX hipster scene is a bit odd as they seem to enjoy 80's music, but I am old enough to know all the songs. Watching the baristas is enjoyable and even better with coffee in your hand. It's definitely a place to people watch. Unlike most hipster coffee places they are not snobby and offer tastes and good conversations. Definitely a good place to meet people. Have fun and drink up."}
{"text":"Best coffee and friendlier baristas than most places. Their beans are good and I way prefer this place over a starbucks because it is less sweet and more coffee flavor. They roast more like how I enjoy my coffee."}
{"text":"Out-of-this-world espresso and PERFECT foam. 
And their scookies (half scone half cookie) are AMAZING.

I love e v e r y t h i n g here.

Cartel: they're doin' it right."}
{"text":"I recently lost my voice. My vocal cords have temporarily exited the building, and because of this.. I wanted some hot tea to sooth the pain from the sandpaper I apparently swallowed in my sleep Friday night. The location had been previously decided, and only wonderful things were spoken about it, so off to Cartel we go.. 

This joint is hidden. Had I been driving, I probably would have missed it. Also the parking situation is shit. My friend and I had to guide a 16 year old girl in her mothers boat of a vehicle, out of her parking space to avoid hitting the car that was illegally parked behind her, only to be honked and screamed at by (insert ASU douchebag here). idiots. We did get her spot though, which was directly in front of the entrance. Score. Upon entering, there are piles and piles of fliers and random magazines and also a box of what looked like dirty purses, staplers and shoes. I have no idea.. Anyway, there is radical art work and a sculpture hanging from the ceiling made of bicycle wheels, which was awesome and I want one! Plenty of unique reading material - I opted for the Best of The Onion, also lots of tables and couches full of the entire Indie population of Tempe. Most of these people happen to be Mac users, clearly shop at thrift stores, listen to the M. Ward station on Pandora and wear retro headbands, so I cant really complain. I too use a mac, love thrifting, love that station and have a sweet headband collection myself, so I don't mind this Hippie-esqe crowd. However, some people do.. If that's you, go to the corporate whore known as Starbucks instead. So basically I love the interior and the people that convent here. However, It was about 300° inside. It may have been cooler outside, and we all know how f-ing hot it is right now.. There was no way I was about to order a steaming hot tea while perspiring heavily. Annoyed, I get an iced \"Happiness Blend\" tea, which totally defeated the purpose of soothing my throat, but the tea was nice.. perfectly minty with a hint of daffodil. Everyone tried their hardest to have a sit down and enjoy the effects of caffeine and good company, but it was just way too hot in there, and so we were forced to leave. This situation needs to be handled immediately, otherwise there is no way I can hang out here unless its in January. That's really the only thing I have to complain about. I didn't try any of their coffees, but it smelled wonderful and the foam art that was being created was lovely.. I don't know why, but I just enjoy my beverage all the more when there is a foam heart floating on the top. Next time I'm at Eastside Records or Buffalo Exchange, I will walk over and get a coffee.. probably a Mocha and I'm actually looking forward to it too."}
{"text":"Guy behind counter seemed to be texting when we walked in and a bit bothered that we said we had not been before whats good?  I just walked out I dont have time for bad attitudes.  My husband walked out with a green tea.  It was green tea."}
{"text":"I always stop by his place for iced coffee or iced tea whenever I pass through Phoenix. Their iced coffee is awesome---very balanced. Their iced tea is amazing as well. I just wished they have a bigger cup! 

Customer service is always great. I bring my hydroflask whenever I travel and they always full it up with ice and water with a smile.  

Let's not mention their amazing gluten free morning glory muffin! Get it!"}
{"text":"Yummy coffee! The baked goods are to die for. Some of the tables are not the best for studying though."}
{"text":"This location is great for if you work downtown. It's right in the middle of everything. The only downfall here is the hours. I love to do work in coffee shops, but I usually need to do this in the evenings. At night this place is already closed! I'm all its still the same great cartel coffee, but don't expect to come here in the evening or at night, go to the Tempe location!"}
{"text":"yes, it was pert near the best damn coffee i ever had. too bad the cup didn't even get filled - i don't appreciate paying $2.75 for a diner-sized cup of coffee that's only two-thirds full. it wasn't THAT good.

no, the baristas weren't too cool to take my order. quite the opposite actually. the guy who helped was awesome and genuine. after finding out it was my first trip, he explained how it all worked and invited me over to watch him make my drink. very cool.

no, they don't technically have free wifi...or any wifi. i called ahead of time and was told they did. sure enough (as another reviewer already noted) they piggyback on Wet Paint's connection. after 10 minutes of messing around, the aforementioned barista helped me get online. however, it sat there for minutes trying to load any page. a bust.

no food. 

uber hipsters as well as normal asu kids, hippies, bike geeks, tech geeks, etc.

all in all i would totally come back -- when they get their own damn internet connection. (come on guys, spring the $60 a month to have the second most important thing people come to cafes for)

oh, and when i said i first heard of the place thru yelp, the same barista immediately asked what i took away from all the reviews, and if i had seen the not-so-glowing reviews. i only addressed the clientele notes and quality of coffee accolades, and he went on to say they are very much aware of their yelp presence and take it very seriously. ...and i took that to mean that they care about what customers think, so keep the criticisms coming, because at least one worker cares to address and correct them. and i very much respect that."}
{"text":"This place is super cool. Loved the tree stump stools, the unfinished tables with hardware and chalk menu board. The staff is very nice and the java is pretty darn good. I went for iced latte but I couldn't resist the the chocolate chip cookie with BACON! Yes...bacon! Why does bacon make everything taste better?! 

Can't wait to check out their wine selection next!"}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee is a tasty diamond in the rough. Since moving to Phoenix, I have been rather unimpressed with the food and drink of this town. 

The coffee at Cartel is quite unique from other options in the area, with complicated flavors and delightfully different beans. It is kind of like the first time I drank really great wine."}
{"text":"Fantastic chai but like it or not, you can't avoid the hipster-ness."}
{"text":"I have been back to Cartel many, many times now and this is one place that truly is \"as good as it gets!\"  Five stars hardly seems like enough.  If I could give them 10 stars, I would!

The coffee is perfect in its simplicity.  That first, delicious sip has this uncanny way of making a not so great morning into something a little more bearable.  

And every menu item I have tried has become my new favorite.  The scones, the breakfast burritos, all of it . . . it's ALL fantastic. The food is phenomenal.  

The staff is super-friendly.  The atmosphere calls to me to sit down and enjoy my purchases; it is oh, so very hard hard for me to grab my coffee and go back to work.  And that walk seems so much longer when you have a delicious treat in some sort of to-go container just waiting to be consumed.

My old coffee crew at work still makes the walk across the street to the chain coffee place and gives me a hard time for bailing on our tradition.  I miss walking with them, but I just can't give up my Cartel coffee."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously slow. My third visit and my last.  How can you run a business in an airport and not be able to keep a faster pace."}
{"text":"The coffee and atmosphere are great here. I love to visit local coffee shops and this one is now at the top of my list."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is located just outside of Mill Ave and is apparently the hipster home base of Tempe. If somehow you are allowed in without suspenders or nonprescription clear glasses, you will see exactly what goes on. to the left at least four people playing chess, to the right someone reading a book, but sitting next to someone writing a book, and did someone just walk in with a puppy? Yes. As you walk up to the counter you are already disoriented so you may be confused about what to order. Well, they are known for their cappuccinos, which I can personally vouch for but on a hot summer day in Arizona, I recommend their \"Dirty Horchata\" or \"Espresso Excellente\" a rice milk horchata with shots of espresso. It was good for the minute it lasted. See you there next time."}
{"text":"Neat little place with a small business feel. I don't do coffee so I just stick to the green tea. Nothing special about it. The service is nice. With some of the tea, they encourage you to leave the leaves in, though that leads to a bitter taste from my experience. Meh. No real complaints."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Cartel since 2009. They always have such great coffee, service snd the atmosphere is awesome. I got my iced Toddy and my boyf got an 'over rico' coffee. The staff was so sweet and kind, I love their expansion and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I feel a little idiotic because I have never been to the Cartel in Old Town until last night, and I had been missing out. I met a friend for a beer, and the barista- I think his name was Mikey? was amazing. He was super sweet, helpful and had amazing customer service. We stayed and played some chess, ended up being there until closing and Mikey simply came out to let us know we were welcome to stay as long as we liked, he merely had to lock the outside gate, which led to a hilarious conversation about old school tv shows including Legends of the Hidden Temple.

For being the only person in the store, he was attentive to everyone and as I mentioned, the customer service was impeccable. That's huge for a overcrowded place like Old Town Scottsdale. 

Thanks for a great time! I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I found myself in Old Town after hours searching for a productive workplace.   Coffee Cartel came up highly recommended on Yelp, and I decided to give it a whirl. 

The environment exudes a modern and hip vibe.  

The music was a bit loud, but I would unquestionably return.  This is an excellent alternative to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Favorite coffee shop in Tempe. When we visit from out of town we walk from hotel each am and I get Chemex of great coffee-wife gets a Chai. Environment is relaxed , music, routinely dogs in and out, tasty baked goods, and merch. Put this place in your bookmarks. I order my coffee from three roasters-here, PT's from Topeka, and intelligentsia. Wish we had a shop like this in our hometown!"}
{"text":"Either the architecture or coffee alone would make this place a 5 in my book. The two together make this place unbeatable. The food is also great and fairly priced."}
{"text":"I strolled in early on a Saturday morning. I had a breakfast burrito and some coffee. The food, coffee, and service was outstanding."}
{"text":"The coffee here is superb. The atmosphere, staff, and clientele is the worst. I loathe having to spend any amount of time longer than it takes to order and pay in the place, even with the new renovations (which have made it a slightly more enjoyable place, I will admit). If given the choice I will usually pick a less stuffy and unapproachably hip place. But even with all of my gripes the coffee alone still warrants a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"The drip coffee and cold brew are more on the acidic side and the general attitude is a little unfriendly, but their chai latte is far and away the best in the valley."}
{"text":"Very good pour over coffees but a bit loud (hard to talk) and definitely not better than Lux (sorry bathroom wall scrawlers!)"}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee Lab = True Coffee Artistry.  Which means it serves one of the best cappuccinos I've ever had (visually, texturally, tastefully) however; it took quite a wile to get.  There seems to be one barista at a time and the person at the register will help with the cold drinks so if you're short on time I (dare I say it) go to the big chain.  PS they do have free wifi now ..."}
{"text":"I don't think I'll be visiting here again. To be very honest, it just wasn't my scene. It was extremely crowded, exceedingly loud, and too hipster for my taste. The staff was very impersonal as well, which is something that naturally comes with working at a busy spot.

My biggest grudge, however, was that they didn't have real sugar. They only had liquified cane syrup that tasted AWFUL. Definitely not for me."}
{"text":"In town for a show and got to play with the Prowling Kind. Mickey from the band is also a barista here and she's amazing. All the drinks were great (One&One, cap, Ethiopian Aricha pour over - so good), so many spots to sit and watch, sip and stop - def a must for coffee lovers coming through town. AND beers on tap. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"A great discovery of coffee roasters!  I love stopping here each time I have layover in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"So this place is awesome!!! I didn't even know it existed until I had a business meeting here. 

There are multiple doors to this joint so it's important to remember where you entered in from. This place is also ginormous! There are so many places to sit and work or study. Thank goodness it's this big though, this place is packed and super busy. I recommend coming here if you have some time. If you're in a hurry, you may not get in and out quickly due to their popularity.

Loved the coffee here! I just got the cold brew with almond milk, but the guys I was with ordered a variety of hot coffee drinks and a hot chocolate. All hot beverages came with a sweet design. 

The two things that I didn't favor was the bathroom, it was in super rough shape and the high top chairs were super uncomfortable. On the positive side, this place is pretty cool and the drinks are delightful."}
{"text":"The perfect place to stop by for delicious coffee to lift your spirit up while waiting in the airport, at least that was my experience with it! The place itself is very hip and attractive, and there is a bar area for you to relax while you sip on some fresh made coffee. The people are all laid back yet very friendly and professional, helping to describe their different coffee specials if you can't decide! I know I was bewildered when gazing upon their decorative menu, yet I ultimately decided on their mocha, which was creamy and not too sweet or strong. I hope to come back and try their cold brew or just visit one of their other locations all around AZ! You can't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee Lab has pretty selective hours, but if you have the chance to stop in, you definitely should.

Since the place is only open on weekdays 7am-4pm, it's pretty clear that they are catering to young professionals. My friend and I were pretty much the only people - aside from the baristas - not in business attire. 

The interior is very industrial/hipster-esque. Rusty bicycles and taxidermy mounted to the walls, metal and concrete furniture, and minimalist artwork made from recycled bicycle rims...they all scream hipster!

But aside from that, they had one of the most delicious chai lattes I've ever had. I ordered a 16 oz soy cold chai ($5.50) and it was simply scrumptious. I am glad that I got the bigger size. Sweet, but not overly so and spicy, yet not overly so. A definite must try in the downtown area - if it's open when you get there, that is."}
{"text":"I miss this place so much since leaving. I went there almost every day for a year, bought their coffee for my own coffee at home, and made my own toddies at home using their beans. This is the best coffe I have ever tasted. The service was always cool with me! I live in Texas now and am spoiled and can't find a good cup of coffee to save me... Best of luck Cartel, hopefully someday we will cross paths again!"}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee Lab is a hidden gem located in downtown Phoenix- I walked there today and ordered a large dirty chai mmmm. I will say that I wasn't originally looking for that- I was actually in search for my basic bitch beverage: a white mocha on ice, but they don't have white mochas. What they do carry in its place is a dark chocolate mocha, but that's not my thing. I really did enjoy that dirty chai though! 

The shop also includes snacks and juices from Radish (Desoto Central Market) + coconut water (Vita Coco) and bottled water. 

-Easy access from the Light Rail 
-Located next to Kaleidoscope Juice"}
{"text":"I'm not a coffee drinker so when everyone else in our group got coffee, I asked for their tea selection. 

The staff is super friendly and they recommended the mango black tea for the iced tea. 
I'm a big tea drinker and I'm somewhat picky so I was happy to see they do it right. I.e. Brew strong upon order, and chill with a large cup of ice. 

The tea was so good that I asked for what the brand of tea was, and they were super helpful."}
{"text":"What a nice find in an airport!  We had extra time to kill due to a delayed flight and I was so happy to find a real coffee shop. They have a very limited menu, which I consider to be a good thing.  My latte was prepared with care and was served a very nice drink (with latte art) in a styrofoam cup. They offer several different kinds of beans but what was served to me was the Borbollon.  It wasn't my favorite flavor which is the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars. Something like this should be in all airports!"}
{"text":"What a delicious place in Scottsdale. After a long night out and about, a cold brew is something that one could use to wake up! 

COFFEE: I have grown to love cold brew more and more so I got a small here. No cream or sugar for me, but the coffee does not need any of that. This black cold brew is very smooth! 

Overall, I was a fan of this \"Coffee Lab\" and highly recommend it to people visiting or living in the area."}
{"text":"This place is always fun to walk into. From
Using a square reader for payment to hair salon chairs this place is about as hipster as it gets. I'm not a sophisticated coffee drinker but it seems to be of high quality. Added a new section with tons of outlets but it's still always slammed."}
{"text":"I take coffee very seriously and I have to say Cartel is the best coffee shop in the Phoenix area. Their Lattes are to die for! I visit this place every day and enjoy my latte. Cartel also attracts a very interesting crowd. Everything about it is just great."}
{"text":"I spent years somehow not stopping in Cartel, and finally broke down to check it out. It has such a great atmosphere! I was there to catch up with a friend but plenty of people were working, meeting with big groups, or just popping in to grab a quick coffee. 

I was really excited about the build your own coffee with their three different brew methods - Chemex pour over 20oz, V60 drip in 12oz or 16oz, and AeroPress for 8 oz. On top of all these brew methods they had 6 different coffee beans to choose from. I had the Chemex of the Nyeri Hill coffee. They were busy so it took about 15 minutes for us to get it, and they served our coffee to us in a glass carafe that was way too hot to handle. Once I made my friend beat the burden of pouring the coffee, I wasn't blown away by the flavor. But I will say the description of \"intense blood orange and pomegranate\" is no lie. At other coffee shops I've had plenty of roasts claiming flavor where there really is only one if you use your imagination - Cartel was not at all like that. 

In addition to this they had everything else you'd expect from a coffee shop, plus some beer taps, plus a wall of merch, plus a location that's perfect to grab a cup of coffee to go and stroll through shops. 

Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"my friend took me here for a cappuccino today. it was the smoothest espresso i have ever tasted! i will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Stop by gate C12 at PHX for real espresso drinks pulled by real baristas. Great beans for home too!"}
{"text":"I miss this place. One of my favourite coffee places in a desert full of Starbucks. I love waking into the place (even if it's a bit sketchy from the outside, looks like the hotel from psycho) and seeing the giant roasting vats.

The coffee is the real star of this place and it doesn't disappoint.  The only problem I've ever had was that my cup was empty in about five minutes because I drank my coffee too fast."}
{"text":"Best coffee i ever got in an airport! My latte made my day. :)
There s a little wait though, if you order an espresso drink, as the baristas hand craft the drinks. Definitely with e-file the wait as long as you are not in a hurry."}
{"text":"The iced tea is amazing, as are the baked goods. I have been known to eat an entire maple scone before even getting back to my office.  I don't drink coffee but I hear it's amazing.  Pass by the Starbucks on the corner and head to Cartel!"}
{"text":"I am a pretty huge fan of coffee. I have work at multiple shops and at one point started my own. It's a pretty significant part of my life to say the least.  It is hard to find VERY good coffee in Phoenix. I would say there are probably only two or three places where you can even get a drink prepared properly, and Cartel is hands down one of the best.  I have been there almost every single business day since the first time i tried it a few months ago.  I get a traditional cappuccino every day and it is always delicious. Super friendly, very comfortable place to sit (if the music isn't too loud), and some of the best coffee i have ever had in any part of the world. The only coffee shop that i really promote."}
{"text":"Located in Phoenix international airport, Southwest terminal, gate C 12, this place offers incredible gourmet coffee selection. They have limited choices for drip or they have a wide variety of selections using the clover machine. It does take time to make good coffee so make sure you plan plenty of time to catch your flight."}
{"text":"Absolute best coffee of all time. Everything the serve is high quality and made with precision. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. They even put a heart on tips of my chai (which is my favorite drink there)."}
{"text":"I put forth that we need to institute a new standard of measurement to be used for comparing coffee shops.  Furthermore, I think that Cartel Coffee Labs should use this place as a standard for this new unit of measurement.

I have to assume it's called a \"Coffee Lab\" for a reason.  Too many coffee shops these days are retail stores, where coffee is an incidental thing in all the yelling, stupid names, and fancy colors.  If you look at the menu of Cartel Coffee Lab, there are a total of 13 items.  It's all about the coffee, plain and simple.

Then again, there's really nothing simple about it to those who take their coffee as seriously as this place does.  The artistry of their baristas is not to be trifled with.  These people can make a latte so pretty, you really won't want to drink it (until you do, then you're happy you did).  On top of that, the selection of coffee varietals is impressive.  I've only tried one, but that alone was better than anything Starbucks tries to pawn off on the masses.  Perhaps the use of the term \"Lab\" is because they've actually stepped beyond anything any other coffee shop has done.  Either way, the formula that they came up with works better than anything I've come across before.

Then again, maybe I'm being too hard on the other places.  It's not that they have an intrinsically inferior product, but the reason for these places has been lost behind t shirts and mugs and open mic nights and selling you a card containing the same money you'd use on the place anyway...

I digress.  Cartel Coffee Labs is a great place with a fantastic product.  If their WiFi is weak or the back corner gets dark, I honestly don't care.  Their coffee is excellent and I'll be coming back for more."}
{"text":"The best coffee in PHX! Every time I'm in PHX, I end up coming here almost every day! Great service, coffee and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place has a very cool energy to it. You walk in, before 8 o'clock in the morning and they're blasting tunes from the 70s through a boombox. Definitely a hipster kind of vibe. They don't have a lot of food items but their drip coffee is amazing. It came out right away and the whole process took under a minute to get my coffee. This was a cool experience and the coffee was dope. No reason why you shouldn't go in here. There's a little place to sit outside of the \"lab.\" For an 8 ounce coffee cost me $2.50. Is also a to go window that faces the street in case you want to walk by and grab a coffee, I thought that was pretty cool and unusual."}
{"text":"Almost everything about this place is perfect. .location staff service...but the music. ..every now and then they'll blast that crazy loud punk rock music which is fine in the right setting but I see nearby business people come here and students studying for exams and by the look on their faces they are annoyed with the loud music. This includes me. ...I wish they would tone it down with their selection of music to something more neutral and tolerable for most people"}
{"text":"Definitely better than Starbucks, but I'd prefer Lux or Royal over this place. And $5.00 for a latte is a bit extreme....even if it gives me 5 mins of \"hipster status\""}
{"text":"Wow, have just been introduced to expresso and horchata. The flavors are unbelievably delicious. 
This is now going to be a must place to stop next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was at the airport and just had to make one more exclusively AZ foodie spot. I had heard that Cartel's coffee and pop tarts were stellar so I got myself an iced latte - per their recommendation and the aforementioned Pop tart. 

Unfortunately, i was not impressed with either item. The latte was just... I can't even think of a description other than \"blah\". The pastry was better than a boxed pop tart although quite frankly it was just OK.

I suppose on the positive side I won't be having unconquerable cravings for cartel's coffee or pastries."}
{"text":"Dope spot! Great coffee, tons of seating, great ambiance. Cartel is the premier coffee spot in the valley in my opinion. Can't go wrong with the daily drip any time of day. Coffee is on the bitter side but so dang good. The location in Tempe is very cool."}
{"text":"Cartel has my favorite coffee in the valley. The coffee is a little on the bitter side but extremely tasty. It's located in the heart of old town Scottsdale. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Really cool vibe."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I'm definitely looking to head back here soon.  I think it's really funny how the reviewers talk about snobby barristas - there's definitely an attitude but those reviewers need to work on their self-confidence because it's actually pretty funny.  There's nothing like ordering a non-fat latte and hearing, 'next time you really need to order it with at least 2%, none of that skim bull****.'  So true and so enlightening!

Skim or no skim the latte was bomb and I'm really pumped to go back for more.  Prices are reasonable, and the place has almost a warehouse type vibe going on, with plenty of seating for all of the iPad-toting workaholics.

One last tip - the place is super tough to find, it's behind the little Ash strip mall that has Pollo Supremo in it.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yes this place is full of hipsters in an even cooler environment.  But who cares?  Cartel makes great coffee and the warehouse chic aesthetic makes even a dorky gal like me feel \"with it.\"  I've frequented this place a number of times whilst struggling to finish my ASU degree and now that I'm a (quasi productive) member of society, I enjoy coming here even more, just to remind myself that my struggling student days are behind me.  I inhale the caffeine cloud emanating from my cup, taste, and savour.  Ahhhh.  Pastries and savouries are yummy and the baristas have never been less than super friendly.  Check out a local hangout and get caffeinated!"}
{"text":"Okay, I love love love cartel. The iced chai was a staple in my diet while living in Tucson. The employees know what's up! They are aware of what types of coffees and teas they are serving. I think that their chai is the best thing that has ever happened to Arizona. This location is kind of tricky to find. The entrance faces a neighborhood street and I drove around for like 10 minutes because I was convinced it was right next to Buffalo Exchange. 
The ambiance is great and drinks/pastries are wonderful. I enjoy how they aren't always the same."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to their down town location. It is cute and trendy, but their seating is a little funky because they share the entrance to the Phoenix symphony offices and what looked like a military recruiting office. I had their iced chai, which is incomparable to any other chai I have had in Arizona. Staff was great and busy!"}
{"text":"I've never seen so much junk look so cool!  Bicycle Wheels, hanging Republican elephants, and more... This place is very quaint and laid back.  Its even got a humongo bay door in the back which (when open) almost makes you feel like you are outside under a huge umbrella!

So I came here for Yelp Office Hours, and I have to say... it was so much fun!  I got to meet a bunch of people that I have been wanting to, and the Iced Chai Latte I got was pretty bad ass as well. Thanks Jason and Amy... and Yelp!

This place is pretty damn hard to find, but once you are in, you wouldn't know it.  People are coming and going constantly, and there is a great buzz about the place!  Not to mention it is one of the more 'Green' establishments.  I was told that everything is natural (as can be), and my plastic cup? It said \"CornCup\" and also \"Compostable\" on it. SWEET!

All in all, this place is a great find and now I know why Sara B. is a regular!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I simply adore their chai. it's sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...ooooooooo good! I love the spices are subtle, the taste not too sweet, and the overall hot chai is just delicious. 

This is Tempe's Lux, yes it may not generate the cool from the outside that Lux on Central has but it's obscure locate behind a non-descript office plaza door makes it almost like a speak-easy for coffee lovers. It's an ooh and ah for the visual senses. Stepping into this shop makes it an awe experience, from the outside you do not realize that inside it's quite large, very artistic, visually appealing and yes they have many loyal patrons like myself. Their coffees are top notch, staff most helpful, and this is where hipsters come out in droves during certain nights that at times I feel as though I'm the weird one out in my clean cut jeans, graphic tee, samsung epic phone in hand get-up. 

You must check out this shop, and I really doubt you'll come out underwhelmed rather I'm sure you'll agree that you just had a good cup of chai. =)"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this gem while trapped in the PHX airport. I tried the corn cookie and a cold brew coffee. The coffee was fantastic & I was totally impressed by the corn cookie! I heard some gals mention they have a spicy dirty chai which I'm going to have the next time I am in PHX airport!"}
{"text":"I cant quite remember who first took me to the Cartel Coffee Lab (it might have been Patrick D or Jen H?) but, Thank You. Tucked away in what looks like a old 1960's college office complex, its not the kind of place you just stumble upon. You must be told/shown/taken. Opposite from the odd exterior inside you find a menagerie of local art, random items disguised as art, and college students \"studying\". Come in during mid day and you will see, and smell, the roasting process which happens about six feet from the counter.

 Alright, enough with the atmosphere, lets get down to business...coffee! Not living in Portland, San Francisco, Seattle, or New York finding an amazing cup of joe can be a bit of a challenge. There are a handful places, spanning the valley, that represent the bean well but I'll save those for another review. This is Cartel's time to shine. The menu is not large but who needs it to be when your using quality beans and the best equipment (even an old San Franciscan roasted). Near and dear to my heart is their Iced Toddy. Cold brewed just the way its supposed to be and always tastes perfectly rich and earthy. Espresso, delicious. Cappuccino, tasty. Foam, just right leaf design and all. Mocha, mmm. The only confusing thing about this place is, when ordering black coffee, I can never remember which one I had last time. This is not that big of a problem though as I have never had a bad brew.

 Although, I have never tried any of the pastries offered, they look great and I've never heard any complaints. Take advantage of the free WiFi and, if the weather is nice, sit in the back. The rear wall opens up garage door style and the breeze will sneak in just right."}
{"text":"Fancy coffee that taste good. Interesting unique coffee selection with various brewing methodology. A little pricy for a cup of coffee, but it was good!"}
{"text":"Seems like a stripmall dive until you walk in. Then you get smacked in the face with awesome smells and a great, expansive atmosphere. Great place for a cup and your thoughts, but just as good for a group to sit and have a lively debate."}
{"text":"I broke my word, and went back. Never a line, so quickest way to get coffee before my flight. They're still arrogant and overpriced, but now they won't print a receipt. I'll start walking to terminal 4 to get Peet's.  Nicer, bigger cups and RECEIPTS !"}
{"text":"I have to say that I was pretty intimidated to try Cartel about a year and a half ago - simply based on poor service reviews and threats of hipster judgment.

When I want coffee, its because I'm beastly. I just woke up, I'm not looking like the hottest/hippest/nicest person in Tempe. I mean, I never look like that but when I NEED coffee, I need to dose myself in a safe and secure environment.

So I went to Cartel expecting the worst, I ordered Iced Toddy. To keep my order neutral and cheap. It was okay. Pretty f-ing good in comparison to xtreme bean, my only other Toddy experience. I branched out into soy Lattes because I like to get some protein in the morning. I know....latte for breakfast - aren't I a pillar of health?

NO ONE judged me when I would order my soy latte with sugar-free vanilla in it. NO ONE. I've gotten some jokes about it, but who gives a fuck? It's $4.50 - I'm being a yuppie suburban bore when I order it and I know it and I don't give a shit if they know it. I love them for keeping me in check anyways. How is a kid from Tempe supposed to know anything about coffee? That's not my business. As the customer, it's our business to try new things as suggested by the people who's life's work is coffee.

So I tried an americano by suggestion. Its DELICIOUS. GET ONE. Iced/Hot, whatthefuckeverjustgetone. I go here for an americano EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY LIFE except when I am out of town and I bemoan the lack of Cartel even when I'm in Los Angeles (Mighty City of Intelligentsia). Which brings me to another point, the LINES.

If you are looking for a McLatte, they exist. It's called McDonalds. They are everywhere. Cartel is not a run in/run out kind of place. They are offering a luxury item as well as an experience. You wouldn't go to a spa and bitch about your facial taking too long. If you want to see lines, go to Intelligentsia during the midday rush and you will immediately appreciate what Cartel is doing.

For serving the entire ASU community with outstanding coffee, 20 minutes sounds about right. For a drink that is delicately crafted from bean to cup, $2.50-$4.50 is just right. For a locally owned company successfully competing with corporate giants, you might as well just go and give a deserving shop your money. 

And if you are nervous about being judged by the \"hip\" kids who look like they smelled a fart, recognize that they are only posing with their macbooks and modern literature and are too vain to break character. 
And if you are nervous about being judged by the baristas, try SMILING at the people who are SERVING you - because you remember how hard it was to deal with customers before you got your middle management salaried job, right?

I love you, Cartel."}
{"text":"The place was located right in the center of downtown Phoenix. It's really convenient if you work nearby, but the space is kind of small. It had a minimalist and modern design which won me over a little bit. The biggest downside however, is the fact that it's located on the bottom floor of a building in a lobby. There was a bunch of hustle and bustle of people leaving the building and that wasn't my cup of tea (pun intended). Plus the coffee was expensive and nothing special, which you can expect from a place like this, but it still was a little higher than normal. Very nice hipsters ran the place."}
{"text":"5 star coffee, 3-4 star service. I LOVE the coffee here and visit every time I'm in town. I even order their coffee online and have it shipped to Louisville KY.

The service though is just never super friendly. It's not terrible and these guys definitely know their coffee but sometimes geniuses are not the best with people.

If you're a coffee fan though you need to check it out!"}
{"text":"Cartel is a real gem in the downtown convention area of Phoenix!  I was a little concerned with the multiple Starbucks within a few blocks around this area but was so excited to find this coffee shop just a block from the hotel. 

They roast their own beans and it's totally on par with the coffee I've had in the pacific northwest. We ordered an Americano and it was strong, bold, smooth but not acidic. I am a fan!

I was also able to try their sumptuous breakfast burrito, a medley of fresh veggies (spinach, zucchini, roasted peppers...) with a good load of bacon and fresh pesto and cream cheese. Yum!
Bonus points also for the pumpkin chocolate muffin...dark chocolate and a nice cinnamon and pumpkin flavour! Oh Yah! Bonus points for still being warm!

Place is in a non descript office building but they've done a decent job with the gorgeous wood table tops, walls and kitchen area.

Staff are also super friendly and they love bacon. Can we be friends!?"}
{"text":"This place has never impressed I tried again at Sky Harbor it's just doesn't work for me"}
{"text":"Great cappuccino!  If you end up in terminal 4 in gates C11-C20 definitely stop by!  The staff is great and you even get a real barista steamed milk foam leaf on top of your drink.  I wish these places would skip the Splenda and start carrying some stevia sweetener, but the sugar in the raw gets the job done."}
{"text":"Upon entering I muttered under my breath, \"we're no longer in Tempe, Toto...\" Yes, there are times I imagine I'm Dorothy with some red ruby slippers prancing down the yellow brick road/sidewalk but seriously who doesn't?! Sadly, I didn't have a dog alongside me, and ummm my Toto reference was imaginary, hmmm come to think of it, why do I have a Dorothy in Wonderland fantasy?? wait, focus. Okay, so went in and I was like, wow, this sure isn't like their Tempe location which is unassuming in a strip mall plaza, with nary a window but a door while here it's windows galore, and inside is... I just don't know how to describe it... hipster chic? I mean they had a red chandelier that was hanging low touching the floor, and a deer's head stuck on the wall with a black and white theme BUT the ubiquitous Cartel menu boards hung behind the counter, and somehow the overall interior tied it all in. Anyways, I came for their Chai which still resonates as one of the best places to get one, and it still is. I do like that they have pastries to snack on. Just happy that Cartel is close to me at work, anyways I got to figure my whole Dorothy thing, that's another story."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a cool location.  The coffee I selected wasn't my favorite, but I appreciated the knowledge and care that went into preparing it and talking about it (recognizing that tastes can vary).

Would definitely recommend dropping by if, like us, you were in the neighborhood and desperate for some coffee not made by Starbucks or your random hotel lobby."}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee Lab is packed solid every time I've been there and for good reason. The coffee is just perfect! Compared to some other places where it tastes bland or watered down, Cartel gets it just right.

It can be a bit pricey, but you get what you paid for, a delicious custom coffee :)"}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee Lab has more than just coffee. This location also has Arizona brews and wine. This location is also just a cool place to hang out. Most of the customers where on their computers. I loved the care, discipline, and the attention to technicality and precision that they devote to their coffee. I am use to European coffee and this coffee had a different taste but I loved the smoothness. They roast their own beans. The website offers great advice on how to make a proper cup of coffee at home. www.cartelcoffeelab.com"}
{"text":"Always passed by this place so today, I finally tried it. The place looks nice and would be a great spot to hang out. The price range is decent. I ordered a vanilla latte and I really enjoyed it! I loved that it isn't too much milk like most lattes are. This place is a good alternative for the typical Starbucks cup. Wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"This has definitely become one of my favorite go to places while at work in downtown Phoenix.  Whether I just need some morning caffeine or I need an excuse to get out of the office - it's off to Cartel and it's not hard to find someone to tag along. I used to be a Starbucks Junkie, but have officially become addicted to Cartel.  I can have a Toddy (their iced coffee) anytime of the day, in any weather...even if it's freezing outside.  The best part, I can go back in the afternoon and get another delicious toddy, no charge.

The coffee isn't the only thing that keeps me coming back.  Their homemade pastries are to die for.  Initially I was hooked on the Bacon Chocolate Chip cookies made fresh generally on Friday mornings (what a great way to end your work week).  More recently, I went back in the afternoon for their 'Happy Hour' specifically for pastries.  I tried one of their Bacon Cheddar Scones.  Oh my, I shouldn't have gone there - more afternoon trips to come.  It was delicious and made a perfect accompaniment with a good hot soup too!  I ate it with dinner, but I'm sure it would be just as good for breakfast.

Can't wait to continue to experience all that Cartel has to offer...I just hope I can get a Cartel cup soon.  It's time to get rid of all the Starbucks ones I have and start a new collection."}
{"text":"Grabbing one last coffee before the flight - and whenever possible, I try to buy local when I can (even though I will admit to being addicted to Starbucks). But they didn't have any milk substitutes. I'm not trying to be difficult, but I'm severely lactose intolerant and I was about to get on a 6 hour flight. You do the math."}
{"text":"Neat little place. Coffee was okay. I asked for soy milk but got whole milk Instead (lactose intolerant). I did not like the coffee here, tasted like any other low quality coffee shop. Iam a coffee lover and enjoy nice fresh espresso beans, this isn't the place for me. Good service, cashier was nice and helpful."}
{"text":"A very cool coffee shop in my favorite spot in Tempe. They make great coffee and give you a fantastic place to set down and drink it."}
{"text":"Same options as in their larger locations. I am totally hooked on this coffee. If you have enough time to metabolize the coffee before you jump on a plane, or if you are landing, this is a perfect way to get acquainted with Phoenix.

Also, you can get some snacks, and coffee by the pound."}
{"text":"This is the premier coffee house in Phoenix (actually Tempe), and this location is amazing. Very ample space, pour over options, espresso drinks, really good snacks to nibble on, awesome vibe in general. They do not serve sugar, instead they use syrup, but it is still good. There is another sweetener option, I can't remember what it was. Definitively check this place out and hang out for a bit to get this alternative desert vibe."}
{"text":"Must stop if you love coffee. Pick up some beans, have them make you a drink, and hang out. There are several tables right around the corner, it is a desolate place, but quiet is always good in my book. Good music, yes, this is true, and also a pretty secure place. Good people."}
{"text":"A relaxing, chill atmosphere. I had an iced coffee and read while there - a great place!"}
{"text":"Very friendly coffee staff! It's not my favorite latte in town, but it is one of my favorite plain iced coffees! They also serve the iced coffee at Phoenix Public Market Café. If you like iced coffee, this is your go-to in Old Town! 

I thought it was a nice touch that they serve wine and beer. I'm the first one to admit that's how I get through 50% of my extensive school work/research. Ha! Now I don't have to go somewhere and be that person on their laptop and 10 books at the dinner table."}
{"text":"Wow! Great coffee!! The latte has bold coffee flavor and aroma, with just the right amount of bitterness. Total opposite from the big name chain, charbucks."}
{"text":"A great find! They do coffee right. My breakfast burrito was outstanding. Fresh ingredients, full of flavors."}
{"text":"I really like what my Yelp buddy Chris L. had to say about Cartel back in October of 2014. And I quote, \"Your mileage at Cartel will vary, based totally on your expectations and what you want in a cup of coffee.\" Truer words about a coffee shop (although Cartel is more than that) have never been spoken. You need only to refer to Chris L.'s review to realize that it's not about who you are, it's about what you need. 

Some of us have artsy-fartsy coffee days, but we also have frou-frou coffee days. On those former days, then you best find yourself at Cartel, debating over whether a pour-over or Chemex or French Press is right for you that day. Rest assured that passionate, articulate, and knowledgeable employees will help you; but don't be so quick to write them off as snobbish.

The interior of the Downtown location is spartan, with intriguing taxidermy and hipster-appealing bicycle art throughout. There's plenty of seating, but it's not the \"stay and cuddle a while\" couches and loungers, just more industrial with stools, benches, and metal chairs. 

The coffee itself is fresh, lovingly-roasted, strong, and never bitter. I walked over here 5 weekday mornings in a row while staying at the Hotel Palomar CItyScape,and was never disappointed, just super-buzzed and more enlightened about my coffee!"}
{"text":"Ok - the best hot Mocha I've found in Phoenix. Delicious and the perfect size."}
{"text":"$9 for iced green tea & small Chai?! !$%&! No place to sit. NO personality or good customer service?! Guess you're allergic to smiling. EVERYONE on their laptops. No actual coffee shop chat?
.... And then you want $2 for a refill on tea?! TAKE THAT CARTEL! I'll use my own teabag, thank you."}
{"text":"Speed is not their thing.  Maybe they need more coffee!  But the cute little apple design in my coffee was worth the wait...not to mention the BEST cappuccino ever!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times.  Service is really mediocre and slow as molasses.  If you are in Old Town and in this section of town and need a jolt of caffeine, I guess this is a place you can stop by.  In my last few visits, I decided to skip my order and just join the person I am meeting there and enjoy their company for a few minutes.  It seems a little out of place, I don't see Old town as \"hipster central\".  I think maybe that's why the baristas are so moody, or is that part of being hipster, too?  I guess I'll never know."}
{"text":"I had a coffee meeting here on Friday and thought that it was great! A little bit smaller than I had anticipated so we sat up at their high bar but I love that it is in the heart of Downtown Phoenix. I had an Iced Nonfat Vanilla Latte and it was a little pricey, but delicious! I am a BIG fan of their cold brew as well (We have a keg of Cartel cold brew in our office and it is always a must)! I will definitely be back to one of the Cartel locations again soon!"}
{"text":"happy hour lattes are the gift that keep on giving. and the gifts of love, joy, peace, warmth and happiness and energy...and? idk i'm exaggerating. 

i've never had a more delicious latte and i'm finding that it's making me a bit high maintenance. i'm the most unsnobby coffee person but maybe i will be one now? the rest of the weekend, evertime i'd get any form of coffee, i'd be like 'it definitely doesn't compare to what i had at cartel'. 

which is why i am going to hold off on my review of echo because i am currently insanely biased and unable to give them a fair shot compared to cartel 

who is this coffee snob? jk, i'll still go to town on a folgers anyday."}
{"text":"I had the iced chai and it was spectacular. I always try the chai wherever I go and this definitely had a very fresh, distinct taste to it. The employee was working alone so it took a few minutes to get our order (there were 4 of us) but it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"the tempe cartel has always had a bad reputation as pretentious and unaccessible. however, the snobby barista stereotype does not ring true at all!!!!!! shoutout to my girls samantha and tyler who time and time again have made my nights here bright and happy!!!! i can't promise that the patrons of this shop will share their cool, down to earth attitude but the problem isn't with the people behind the bar - it's (sometimes) with those on the other side. if you wanna take a chill pill though and not be so worried about how you're perceived, enjoy a nice cup (try the kochere on aeropress), and strike up a conversation with your barista, tempe cartel is what's up."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and great location. They torrefy their own beans !  Enjoyed the ambiance even if a bit too many people staring at their Apple computers so a bit to hip in that way. But the coffee is worth the trip"}
{"text":"You cannot beat the coffee here! The taste the strength.... There's no other coffee house like it in town."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this 'hip' - as only a 40yr old can say... coffee lab... And was rewarded with the most beautiful tasting vanilla latte I've ever had.... These folks take their coffee seriously... And they don't burn the beans to death like other ppl we all know! 

Thank u for setting up in the southwest gate area! 

Just don't be in a rush... Really Good coffee apparently takes a bit longer! But it's worth it..."}
{"text":"Blondie cookies. 'Nuf said.  Notable improvements each time I visit.  I am thrilled to find a spot serving Costa Rican coffee and Clover Organic dairy products.  The daily coffee options are not always presented on the menu but the team is happy to offer suggestions.  Don't be afraid to ask.  Service is not without bumps but once you try the brew, sweets and food, it is easy to overlook the shortcomings of Cartel.  I think they know that.  Some kids are justified to be too cool for school."}
{"text":"Coffee is good (but not amazing) but the prices are crazy. An americano and a piece of banana bread should not be $8.00. What the heck???  Over $4 for an Americano. Really ?   Will say lightning fast wi fi though."}
{"text":"Not from Arizona and I was craving coffee decided to check this place out over the usual Starbucks and it was great! Service and ambience was perfect!"}
{"text":"Certainly the best coffee in town!!!! Staff is helpful and friendly, but does lack being personable. This place is always a relaxing and casual environment. Space is great to meet friends or even have a business meeting. Great coffee and hangout. Try their americanos, always smooth and delicious. They will even make it with warm water so it is not too hot and you don't have to add ice or cold water, which can make coffee bitter. Thumbs Up!!!!"}
{"text":"23 MAY 2011 (MONDAY) LUNCH (Downtown Phoenix Location)

We are not connoisseurs (Not the Yelp picky palate reviewer) of food but enjoy well prepared and good tasting food. 

The menu wasn't extensive but there were a couple of choices.

A set of surrounding business group entered and left as quickly 
as they entered. The limited menu options appeared the reason.

We ordered the Tuna with a multi-grain bread and cheese, lettuce and tomatoes, chips and water. Very tasty and fresh. The guy Friday asked if he could provide a surprise cookie from the happy hour and it was a fudge cookie with walnuts. Almost ate it all before the meal arrived.

We took a photo of the food but couldn't wait and took a bite. :-) 

The ambiance of Cartel Coffee Lab created a very welcoming environment. Not noisy or crowded. The service was great. Very prompt and attentive. The most important part of the visit besides the art was the youngster (Anyone under 35 is a youngster to us but he was around 25) was down to earth and made you feel it wasn't the usual fake  restaurant dialogue. 

The crowd appeared to be the retro, art, bohemian, buffalo exchange scene. When a person is comfortable in their own skin they have the ability to adapt to any scene. It reminded us of a Greenwich Village (A section in Lower Manhattan) eatery.

The do it all guy (Cash register and serving) informed us (me) that the art on the walls are from Galeria De Los Muertos at 905 N 5th Street in Phoenix. They have some type of connection. Should have inquired regarding Cartel Coffee Lab affiliation with the gallery.

The Cartel Coffee Lab (We don't drink any caffeinated drinks) will be a nice lunch date but you will have to negotiate parking in 
downtown phoenix. The meter maid enjoys her job. 

If you know that you intend on just hanging out park in garage or better yet park at the Raymond Burr Library for free and take the Light Rail three stops and walk over. 

We reviewed yelp and decided to include this spot and it was
a good choice. You shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hands down the best coffee in the airport!!! It's btwn gate C11-C17"}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops in town. The coffee is always smooth and never bitter or burnt like Starbucks. I love the designs they make on the top of the coffee! Such a great touch! My one recommendation would be to have more milk options like almond or coconut for those who don't drink dairy or soy."}
{"text":"Love good cup of chai tea with almond milk! I judge by if their using syrup or making tea fresh. Cartel is making it fresh as it taste so delicious! I almost drank the entire cup with one gulp! The one thing I did not care for was the small cups for the price. I would like to have bigger cup as this size would be gone in second with me. Taste I would give this place \"A.\" Maybe next time I will get the bigger size as I know I like the drink. My mom got cold brew with little creamer and she was happy with taste as well but again her cup size is small as well. I will visit this location again as it has plenty of comfortable seating with tables to work or browse the Internet with laptop with free WiFi."}
{"text":"I have only been here once so you can take my review or leave it but first impressions do matter.
I was looking for a coffee shop alternative that wasn't a big chain like coffee bean so I researched this place and watched their video on their website that made this place sound good. Aye, am I so gullible or what? Of course the video on the business' website is going to make their own business sound good.

Anyway, walked into Cartel and immediately was thrown by the hipsters sitting around chatting by the front door window as they were the mannequins to advertise the store. I hoped there would be no hipsters but that's exactly what I found at this place.

I ordered a green tea for $3.75. Eh.  The guy at the counter starting babbling about tea infusions and such that I really didn't care about. I once paid $4.25 for a tea but I at least understood why because they bagged their own tea. Now this one was just as expensive but it was just tea leaves and water, not even hand bagged or anything. I'm not completely poor so I didn't care as much about the price, but what really got me was that the ambience was so poor that I had to leave with my $3.75 tea since I just could not work in this place. 

I had planned to do some creative work on my lap top and I wanted my own little space, even a small table to myself would have been fine, but no. They have bean bag-like cushion chairs on the sides with a low table that in no way resembles a desk and the only other seating is basically long benches you have to share with others. No personal space. I could see this place being really great for collaborative meetings or even social interactions, but that's not what I was looking for today. 
I was looking for a cute, little non-chain coffee shop, not too loud, where I could work on a creative project.
Didn't find that in here. The energy was just a little weird, from the seating to the staff, I just couldn't spend another minute.
I got my tea to go and left and was pissed that I even bought the tea in the first place because I could have spent $3.75 in another place with better ambience.

But after letting the tea steep, it was decently flavored. It's not much to making tea though. Like I said earlier, take it or leave it. But I'll never go back in here again."}
{"text":"Great coffee and tea options! Macchiato was just how I expected it to be and of great balanced taste and flavor."}
{"text":"LOVED it!

Done and done.

Did I mention I am petitioning them to get an IV drip of their Guatemalan coffee? Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"If I lived in the area, I would likely frequent Cartel.  Their \"One & one\" is a great way to experience the wonderful qualify of their single origin coffees.  The barista was amiable and informative, even following up with me, curious how palatable the espresso (one)  and machiatto (& one) were.  Well, hell, I am pretty sure I just consumed a creamy tangerine in liquid form.  Yum.  I followed with a cold brew, same origin/roast.  Still delicious and citrus-y, super smooth and less acidic.  Derishous.

Why the 4 stars?  No, not the obvious apple computer toting, tight jean wearing, \"my band is so innovative and progressive because we have an accordion\" hipster customers (why do customers complain about the other customers?).  The music is just way too loud and the chairs hurt my ass. Also, the prices are a little high, even for their quality."}
{"text":"Cartel managed to do what the others haven't - have the airport site be just as good as their other locations - best coffee in Sky Harbor!"}
{"text":"Stayed for 7 hours grading papers. Got the pop tart, Columbian natural-processed pour over, cortado, espresso, and a one-and-one. All were excellent. Awesome vibe and atmosphere. Definitely gotta check them out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee. 

I was walking around Old Scottsdale in search of breakfast on Easter morning when a lot of the other nearby coffee shops were closed. I ordered a cortado, which was excellent. It was very smooth - not bitter at all! 

As far as other breakfast options at Cartel, there are some baked goods such as muffins and cookies, though you might need to go elsewhere if you are looking for something heartier."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in town and looked for something decent near our hotel. Coming from San Francisco and Seattle we've developed quite a taste for good coffee. Cartel did not disappoint! I'm so excited we stopped in here. Great coffee, great vibe, great way to start a morning. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm not impressed with this location. The coffee I received was wrong. Prices were reasonable for an airport, but the lack of a menu bothered me."}
{"text":"I was going to give cartel an expected 4 stars but then I saw the barista brewing coffee with a clever dripper, an onyx scale and that Japanese kettle whose name I can't remember. For the coffee snobs that know brewing methods, I'm sure you are all massively grinning. She took good care at adding just the right amount of water, at the right temperature and for the exact amount of time. There is no other method better in my book.

For the non coffee snobs, I'm happy to tell you that my chai latte was delicious: creamy, milky, spicy and not a single wattery-powdery flavor like many others. 

The place is teeming with 20-something (oh please be legal) on their Mac-books listening to Bon Iver and pretending not to just be fucking around on FB while their Poly-Sci book is wide open on some random page they've never read."}
{"text":"I always look forward to coffee from Cartel Coffee. I'm a big fan of both the aeropress and chemex hand pour coffee. If you're in a hurry - the drip coffee is quick and delicious also."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, perfect music selection (Leon Bridges), the attention to detail on my dates double cappuccino was like none that I've experienced - highly recommend."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, awesome cold brew, convenient location, plentiful parking, free wifi. Would definitely recommend!

It's a pretty small space with limited seating and outlets - perfect for a coffee date, quick catch up session, and small group projects, but it's probably not the best place to study at. Plus, their chairs really aren't that comfortable."}
{"text":"Hipsters amaze me. Mostly because I'm the exact opposite of a hipster. 

Questions that rack my brain:
+How do these men get their jeans on? They're so tight! 
+How long did it take to get that many tattoos? 
+What kind of hair spray do hipster chicks use?
+How do you decide to become a hipster? Is there a school? Or a manual at least?

I wonder if they look at me with amazement as well? Probably not, mostly because I'm not a hipster and quite ordinary when compared to a hipster. 

Visiting the beautiful wood and metal adorned Cartel Coffee Lab is like watching hipsters in the wild... 

(Insert British voice over and African safari noises) 

Watch the hipster making coffee in their natural habitat. They are pleasant, but not overtly friendly. You look them up and down. They don't really care what you are wearing. You are fascinated... they just want to know what you want to drink? You cannot decide... the hipster is not openly bothered but most likely is annoyed by your inability to make a decision because you get nervous when hipsters stare at you. You make your decision and the hipster asks you what size. Shit, another decision must be made! Their coffee cups are small as this is not an anti-hipster corporate hangout, aka Starbucks. Wow, you think! Hipsters are so cool they don't even need a super sized venti coffee to feel important. Do you secretly want to become a hipster? No. You have no tattoos and are pretty sure that's the first requirement for being a true hipster. They do a good job with their coffee though so you shall continue to be fascinated by hipster culture from afar. 

\"Hipster\" (as defined by Urban Dictionary: 
Definitions are too mainstream. Hipster's can't be defined because then they'd fit in a category, and thus be too mainstream.

Shut the front door!

{"text":"Jason Silberschlag pulls off a pretty amazing thing here in the metro-PHX area.  Three shops with their own quirky details, passion and identity.  Each tailors specifically to the demographic at hand, which I can totally get behind.  The fact that each shop has its own deal going on is awesome - I really dislike chains and the chain feel/look.  I hadn't seen Jason in a while at the other shops, the times I'd frequented, and was happy to see him behind the bar when I came here for the first time.

Just the same way the other Cartel shops have a selection of brewing methods, this one does as well.  Pour-over, aeropress, Chemex and traditional espresso (La Marz GS/3).

As expected from him, our drinks were flawless.  He transfers this knowledge and passion to the baristas, which is obvious even when one leaves his establishment to go somewhere else - they stand out in the crowd of many coffee-pullers.  The beans, who can complain?  Jason made his name with the roasting.

I got a prepared sandwich here, and my was it tasty.  Bread was fresh.  Sauce, ingredients and overall creation was good.  Big Ben: you stole my tastebuds' heart that morning.

Casual lounge area (see: couches), outdoor covered seating (see: hallway - shaded and cool!) and plenty of seating inside.  As normal, his handiwork shines throughout the shop.  Somehow I've never reviewed a Cartel shop before, despite my years of patronage.  My latest experience changes that."}
{"text":"Visited Cartel a handful of times now for lunch during the week, they're one of the coolest coffee stops in Phoenix. Since they have such limited hours, getting there usually needs to be a planned thing. They've got a solid food menu, try pretty much anything on the menu and you won't be dissapointed. I usualy grab their turkey sandwich and sometimes a pastry of some sort.

Whats up with not being open for breakfast on the weekends? I ended up at Lux on Roosevelt and 3rd ave last weekend after a couple miles bike ride into downtown only to find Cartel was closed. I guess I should have popped open yelp first to find their business hours. :( 

Unfortunately for all you weekenders or bar hoppers, you'll have to get your fix at another stop. I'd suggest Lux or Jobot if you're in this general vicinity during their off hours."}
{"text":"Black coffee for $4?!! Crazy ritzy! Coffee beans from all over the world...maybe that's why?! 

Nothing special...most likely would not be back."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Laid back friendly atmosphere!

Plain black coffee tastes good here! Just a little overpriced for plain coffee...I must be paying for quality."}
{"text":"As far as airport coffee goes, this is some of the best I've had, since I personally get tired of Starbucks very quickly. They put a lot of effort into making the drinks, or so it appears, since I watched them weigh out the beans before starting.

The serving sizes are small, but the latte I had was decent! I wouldn't mind returning during my next layover in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee paired with a welcoming atmosphere. The medium roast can be drank dark and is amazing cold."}
{"text":"YESSS! Finally a legit coffee house in the airport with a affordable prices. YOU MUST GO if you are near. Cold brew is delish!"}
{"text":"Aahmayzeeng coffee spot!!!!!
Went once and ended up going every day during our stay in Phoenix!!!!
Coffee- tried a variety on each visit - was fresh, perfectly brewed and steaming hot!!! Just the way it should be!
Baked goods- if you get them before they get sold out!!!- are super delicious!
It's way bigger than it looks on the outside. But you can find seating if you look around a bit. 
Loved the decor also- funky and welcoming.
A perfect place to perk up for the day...."}
{"text":"I can't think of any other coffee shop that compares. Their espresso is top notch and I love that a size small is truly small. 

The only thing I don't like is if you get a loose leaf tea, instead of putting it in an infused, they put the leaves in a boiling cup of water which gets very bitter because it's obviously over steeped. I can't for the life of me figure out why they do this. 

Otherwise it's excellent"}
{"text":"Nice place to have coffee. Pretty chilled out place and you can see the coffee getting made. Lot of people go there to work from that place or have discussions over coffee."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. 

They have a very mellow, laid back vibe going on here. The employees are friendly and not pretentious at all (a trait I've noticed throughout old town). 

Cartel is a great place to hang out or study- music is chill and not too loud. Not to mention the chai is amazing. Seriously, like nothing I've had before. Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Meh. After getting raves reviews from our hostess at Brush Bar we headed down to enjoy some coffee before heading home. The store is hipster and fun with a warm and inviting feel to it. The barista was friendly and very knowledgeable. The coffee was just meh for me though. In fact, my iced mocha tasted burnt. I didn't finish it. Maybe it was just an off time--I mean who normally goes to get coffee at 9PM...but I expect the coffee to taste as good at 9PM as it does at 7AM. Maybe that's just MY high expectations speaking tho."}
{"text":"Best coffee in the Scottsdale area. 

A bit pricey, and if you're looking for Starbucks-type coffee the way YOU like it, go to Starbucks. These guys won't ice your espresso because it gets bitter, and won't put your espresso in a paper cup to go. It's unlikely you can order a caramel macchiato or the other weird sugar bombs people seem to like from Starbucks or Coffee Bean Tea Leaf. But you know what?The drink that comes over that counter is REALLY GOOD. 

Also, great selection of beer! Glad to know I can go somewhere on the weekend to have a latte then a beer while I work -- or maybe a couple beers, until I no longer feel like working. Plenty of space to work, excellent interior design (I believe the owner makes the really functional and comfortable industrial-modern furniture) and luckily, the crowd in the Scottsdale location turns over pretty quick, no one is sitting around for hours or needing to get kicked out by the baristas. 

It's a little unclear what food they serve, there's always a couple things in the case next to the counter, have never tried any of it. Too busy trying to figure out if I want another cup of coffee or a beer."}
{"text":"I'm actually really sad to write a bad review of Cartel.  I recently fell in love with their coffee and the atmosphere, but after my experience there today, I can honestly say I'd rather spend my money somewhere else.

So, like many people, my girlfriend and I have our \"usual\" drink....a large, iced, soy latte with honey, where the honey is on the bottom of the cup and the espresso shots are used to melt the honey before the soy and ice are added.  It makes for a truly delicious drink, and Cartel has served me really amazing versions over the past month or so, including 2 days ago, up until today.

My girlfriend ordered our drinks, and after she paid, the barista told us that \"they don't put honey in the lattes\".  We were confused by this and explained that we've had the drink on many occasions.  He asked us where we've had it.  Quite condescendingly.  I got a little sassy and explained that we've had it here, at Lola, at Lux, and we even used to make our own at the Fair Trade Cafe since both of us used to be baristas there.

The barista at Cartel literally refused to make the drinks we paid for saying that he could add vanilla or hazelnut, but that \"honey doesn't make our coffee taste good.\"  Excuse me?  My girlfriend even offered to pay extra for the honey, yet they still refused to give us what we asked for.  Having made the drink myself, I know it's not difficult or annoying to make, and I was really irked by his attitude.

We settled for vanilla flavor, and after the first sip, decided we wouldn't be coming back to the establishment.  Thanks a lot, Cartel.  Best of luck."}
{"text":"Great coffee joint but the Americano was a bit too acidic.  Lots of people were ordering some baked goods as well. Will have to try that next time.


Just ordered the ice coffee, much better than the americano, less acidic."}
{"text":"They're a swanky little spot in Old Town.  I can see that, because there's so many people.  I just don't understand why..

The set up is pretty cool.  Kinda cozy, kinda industrial.  A little darker than I like, especially where the pastries are since you can barely see them..  Which is why I asked the guy what they were and turned out they were actually 3 items spread out over 6 display risers.  A little sign or something to hint at what these items were would definitely help the ordering process.  Especially if the worker missed the delivery and had no idea what was in them..  

So we order 2 black coffees and turns out they didn't have enough to fill the tiny tiny cups for both so they say it'll take a few minutes while they brew it I guess manually?  They have the Aeropress (which is what we use at home), and various sized drip contraptions which I'm assuming they went with to make our coffee.  

The coffee was a bit sour, which happens when the coffee is under brewed.  We do it ourselves at home once in a while, but we're not paying 2.50 per Dixie cup.  The scone was actually pretty decent but I was looking for a pastry, not the limited option of scone, muffin or cookie.  Even so, I wouldn't rate so low if the coffee was good at the coffee shop."}
{"text":"BEST COFFEE IN PHOENIX AZ!!!
Cartel roasts their own coffee and their staff are all knowledgeable experts on all matters coffee related. They offer espresso, pour-over brew and cold brew coffees.

If you are a coffee aficionado, CARTEL is your place to go.
Fantastic coffee, small batch roasting and friendly staff.

Thank you for being awesome, CARTEL!!!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely, positively, in love with this place.

Possibly one of the best coffee places I've been to, let alone coffee places in the airport. I am so happy that my flight was delayed (haha! thanks Southwest) so I could get a chance to check out this place which wasn't near my gate.

This place is small, but it packs a punch. You can get a pour over in 4 different ways, you can get what is called a One and One where they pull two shots, one into an espresso and one into a macchiato with some kind of dairy or soy so you can try it both ways. 

I am a little surprised that they were unwilling to accommodate Cron J's request for three shots of espresso over ice,  because they were sure extremely accommodating to me. 

If you are a coffee snob, definitely check this place out. Their espressos are smooth, lattes are velvety and pour over coffees are downright delicious."}
{"text":"I'm noticing a trend in my recent reviews. Caffeine!

Best mocha I've had.... bar none. Of course I still love Miss Lola and Lux but if Cartel were closer to home (or the downtown location was open on Sunday) I'd be here all the time.

The wait is long no matter what time you come. Stop whining. Deal with it or go to Starbucks so I don't have to wait so long.

The decor is cool, the location is hidden and there is an abundance of chicks with mullets and dudes with neck beards, neither of which bother me. I had a strange verbal exchange with a barista that left me confused but I think that was due to my foggy Sunday morning state. I haven't experienced the snarky attitude that others have made mention to....and I'm pretty in tune with that sort of thing. Some would say overly so.

One more thing worth mentioning is that the music is at a decibel level that it's not a nightmare trying to hold a conversation. (take note Lux) As a matter of fact, I could hear the hilariously awkward conversation next to me. That's always fun..."}
{"text":"I'm always in search of great coffee and this place has great coffee. It's a little place and if you blink, you might just miss it! The staff was knowledgable on their coffee and equipment.  It reminds me of the type of place you would find in Downtown Phoenix, but instead it's in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Their iced chai latte is delicious. Their hot drinks are not served that hot, so order them extra extra hot. The music can be really weird sometimes. The last time I was there, it was literally just random electronic noises and was very distracting. I'd recommend bringing headphones if you need to study or do work."}
{"text":"While heading to my gate in the Phoenix International Airport I saw the Cartel Coffee Lab out of the corner of my eye. At first I read the word lab, and thought hmm that sounds interesting. Then my eyes diverted from the name to the large collection of growlers sitting on a shelf.. and knew this could only mean one thing at a coffee place. Cold Brew! 
Low and behold Nitrogen enforced cold brew straight from the tap. Wait a minute... is that pour-over coffee, and is that only a few things on the menu? Where am I?? For a brief moment I thought I had exited the airport. Is this for real has Phoenix introduced coffee heaven into their airport? I think so. 
The cold brew was fantastic by far one of the best I have had in all of the country. It appears that Cartel is actually from Tempe AZ where they have a roastery and coffee house. I will be hitting that up for sure on my next trip to AZ. 
Who knew after traveling the entire state of Arizona in the blistering heat, and looking for Cold Brew that I would find it in the airport on my way out of the state. Classy Arizona Classy!"}
{"text":"If you own converse sneakers, a studded neck collar, tight jeans, or multiple facial piercings - you can find your people here. Or you will also fit in if you have a laptop and need to study (just make sure that your laptop has a sticker that says \"REBEL\") - anywho, there seems to be a good amount of students here.

So when you are looking for this place, don't expect a huge sign...it's actually just a door with a 6 X 11 sign that says \"cartel coffee lab\"...I was afraid that there would be a secret knock to get in. Once you enter, you'll be overly stimulated by nude art and creative pieces of functional décor. Plenty of seating and outlets make for a student friendly environment. The music selection is rather schizophrenic. It's like a Pantera/Metallica mix meets Garden State soundtrack. Seriously, it would wax wane between nice and chill to yelling...i.e. The Only Living Boy in New York by Simon and Garfunkel  followed by Lightsabre Co**sucking Blues by Mclusky....that's right I had to shazam it because I was so turned off by the music selection....just pick one or the other.

Their menu has no prices on it and that annoys me. I asked where the prices were and they said they weren't printed anywhere....couldn't even find them online. Just not customer friendly I thought.

I always get a double espresso wherever I go, so I decided to order that here. According to the barista it had an accent of lime with an almond hint and gave me a tadbit of the ugh. It was sour and didn't go down smoothly at all. The lime overwhelmed what I think the barista was intending. Maybe I just couldn't appreciate the complexity of the brew - but it wasn't for me. The espresso came with a shot of club soda as well to keep the palate cleansed and I wish I had more club soda to wash away the taste. I will say beware, the strength of 1 shot of espresso is tantamount to 2 shots at other places...needless to say my double shot will keep me awake until dawn.

This place has so many good reviews that I will most likely give it another shot (get it?)."}
{"text":"This is the first decent coffee I have had in Arizona. In London, we take our coffee very seriously and I was so pleased when I discovered this wonderful gem! You can choose a variety of beans, mainly south american and Mexican (no African beans when I went). They have the regular latte, cappuccino etc but for those looking for a real treat, they have areopress, v60, clever, and chemex! I had an areopress which was almost perfect. Their baked goods are also lovely, mainly the scones and banana bread. This is a proper coffee place so you won't find silly caramel sweet sugary coffee or other nonsense..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their lattes. It's unfortunate that their locations aren't convenient for my normal commute or else I would be in everyday. However, that doesn't stop me from leaving an extra 30 minutes early (and being a few minutes late) if I'm craving some Cartel. It's definitely not a quick stop though. Be prepared to wait about 10-20 min to get your drink....it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Unaccommodating, rigid and a little bit stuck up. I was also disappointed when they told me I couldn't have one of their pour over coffees iced. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"BEST coffee. I buy by the pounds. Ridiculous affection for their coffee. Also I love that they serve tea as it should, with an array that will transport you to a time of chivalry and manners. And not mention, alcohol is available if you need something stronger. I'm in utter love. My fave wine is the Stronghold Tazi. Why not? It's a local wine! The white chocolate beer is pretty good. What more can you ask for but marriage of those two things?

Staff is awesome, the hiring manager has an eye for talent. They are all uber cool in the Seattle stylish way. I think every creative artist, startup mogul, and entrepreneur frequents here, albeit the tourists wandering Old Town for unattractive \"southwestern\" pieces to collect. The setup is spacious with communal tables and cute wood stumps to plop your feet or computer. Plenty of plug outlets for you looking to dock and get on the wifi. I prefer the patio as it is really lovely to watch patrons and also soak up sunshine and fresh air."}
{"text":"I have been going to Cartel for 4-5 years now (thanks to a college friend).  It is my absolute favorite place for coffee and espresso... they really know what they're doing!  I love their drinks, the environment is cool, and everyone that works there is always really friendly.  My boyfriend and I always buy their beans to use at home.  Every time we travel, we like to check out local coffee places, but Cartel is still by far our favorite.  We are lucky it's at home!

Congrats on expanding, and thank you for showing people what coffee is really about!"}
{"text":"Can't imagine being able to get a better coffee in an airport anywhere. Also, get their homemade Pop Tart whether you're hungry or not. I will be trying to plan my layovers in Phoenix more often just to stop here."}
{"text":"When pulling into the area, I was a little skeptical. It's way nicer on the inside!

As someone who's not a HUGE fan of coffee (I usually stick to the Starbucks drinks that hardly taste like coffee), I wasn't too sure I'd actually like anything here. I was pleasantly surprised! I enjoyed my iced mocha quite a bit, and I liked the atmosphere of the place, but it was really hard to find seating and a little loud. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Cartel location in the valley!! I've been to the one on Ash a thousand times since it's so close to campus, and while I love the look and the vibe, it's crowded pretty much all the time so there's not always seating available. I like that the old town Scottsdale location is much more relaxed and quiet, but still a nice atmosphere. The natural lighting is just wonderful, and there's a lot of extra seating in the covered area between Cartel and the building next to it. As of all Cartel locations, love the coffee and I absolutely love that they use Maya Tea! If you're a fan of chai and haven't tried it yet, it is life changing!! Best chai I've ever had, hands down.

Lots of love for the coffee, the chai, and Cartel!!"}
{"text":"I complained that espresso in a paper cup is an insult (all too common at Starbucks and the like). They smiled and said they'd never do that to someone."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time and boy did this place deliver. This place has a nice vibe when you walk in. They have cool art on the walls nice furniture and they even take your order and have you pay on an I-pad. But the best thing is the COFFEE. I had a Agave with soy (I think that's what it's called) it came with 3 shots of espresso and was Super delicioso! I will be back Screw Starbucks the Cartels moving in on their turf."}
{"text":"Awesome tea latte!  They take time and care with each beverage and I would highly recommend.  It's way then your standard Starbucks."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot. I lived in Arizona for 21 years and never saw a place like this one until after moving to New York and then coming back to AZ on vacation, two years later. Definitely fitting of Tempe. Staff wasn't overly friendly, but they were polite! Atmosphere feels a little judgey, but I suppose that's just because of the people in the area. Delicious cold brew and beautiful ambience."}
{"text":"I'm a coffee lover..!! I've been to many coffee cafes. This Cartel coffee Lab is the best.  I had a Cappuccino,the flavor was amazing.. So smooth and yummy. I can't to  go back.      Peter(Sedona)"}
{"text":"I'm new in town and don't know many people, but one of the few peeps that I do know, informed we would be going to coffee today AND it would be at Cartel Coffee Lab.

...You could say I didn't have a choice...but then again I didn't object either  :-)

I have stumbled into a few local coffee shops in Scottsdale and also a few chains (no shame people) Cartel definitely gives it's competitors a run for their money. 

When we walked in, the smell exactly what you'd hope if you love the smell of coffee. It smelt like ~Heaven~ and by heaven I mean roasted coffee beans. People were chatting, working or simply enjoying their beverage of choice (there's even beer and wine on tap!)--it was a very welcoming and relaxing vibe.

Ok so what did I order? My girlfriend said they make a great chai so I took her word for it but took it a step further...I ordered me a *dirty*chai (chai with a shot of espresso). and It was Perfect. If you love chai you know how important it is for it to not be too sweet and this had the perfect combo of spice, hint of espresso and creaminess!

It's sad to admit how much I loved Cartel Coffee Lab's brew and have to accept that it's out of the way to get on a regular basis but when I'm in the neighborhood I will definitely be stopping in to get my fix!

*cheers*"}
{"text":"I lack the necessary hipsterness to come here too often. However, their espressos are exquisite, as long as you don't order them to go. They don't do that."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing, but recently they've gotten \"hot girl syndrome\", meaning they don't try as hard cuz they're popular. 
My main complaint was the cashiers attitude. I like to drink my lattes out of a ceramic mug cuz it's part of the experience, it tastes better, and reduces trash.... but when I tried to ask her about the ceramic mug sizes, she didn't understand I was referring to those, and gave me attitude as if I'm stupid. And even if I did ask a stupid question, as a cashier it's your job to deal with ppls stupid questions and smile.... i did it for 2 years. 
Also they actually didn't have any ceramic mugs that day, and I think that's absolutely unacceptable for a indie coffee shop, even if your washing machine is down. You should wash one by hand if a customer asks for it."}
{"text":"There's a small shop in Scottsdale's 5th Avenue where you can feel a bit at home if you're visiting Arizona on a short trip. 

And this place is Cartel Coffee Lab. 

Whether you're a big fan of coffee or not, you can definitely find a drink that will suit your taste buds here. For me, this was their soy chai latte. Unable to find the perfect cup of soy chai latte at other locations (example: Starbucks, the only coffee shop I've seen in Arizona), I was distraught... until I found Cartel. 

This little hipster cafe has many wooden tables where you can spend the morning working or chatting with friends. This cozy place is always packed with people but it's also very quiet and down to earth every time I visit.

I was so delighted to find Cartel at the Sky Harbor Airport a few days ago. Cartel in Scottsdale is supposedly the hardest gem to find in Arizona, according to the barista at the airport Cartel. I'm glad I've discovered two in my short trip."}
{"text":"Being from Baltimore, we don't have places that serve Coffee AND alcohol.  We need some of them.  When we went in, my friend, who suggested the place, said that it had almost tripled in size since the last time she had been here. 

While on vacation in San Diego, Las Vegas, Flagstaff, Sedona, Tempe, and Phoenix, we had coffee in every city.  AND THIS PLACE HAD THE BEST COFFEE.  

The menu was pretty basic, and sometimes ordering coffee gives me anxiety as I want to try new things, but don't want to seem like a nerd asking what exactly is a 
\"venti mocha latte\" so I do the fake it til' you make it method.  I got an iced vanilla latte, and MMM!  

I saw some people with beaker and flask coffee \"cups\" and saw them on the menu, but honestly had NO idea what it was.  I just really liked the look of it.  I would have liked a menu with some descriptions of what it was.  

I wish they had stickers.  I bet the coffee lab logo would be awesome."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great coffee in downtown Phoenix, this is it. Americano, Iced Toddy, Mocha latte, all on par! There are many good coffee shops down here, I think others have better pastries, but Cartel has the best coffee beans! Smooth & true to the coffee taste buds. Their breakfast burritos are insanely delish.  I also like the view out the windows of U.S. Airway & City Scape, plus it's never been crowded when I'm here!"}
{"text":"After a satisfying meal and a nice stroll in Old Town Scottsdale, it was coffee time.  I didn't want to go to that useless overpriced overhyped Starbucks and my friend, a local in this area, took me here.  The coffee was strong but not bitter.  Perfect.  The atmosphere has a coffee shop yuppie feel, but I'm not complaining.  Come by for your java fix and leave satisfy."}
{"text":"Very nice coffe shop.  Nice atmosphere.  The drinks were excellent.  
I will be returning there the next time I'm in old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I still have no idea how I've lived within walking distance of this place for years and never heard about it.  This place is in a very odd location and is pretty hidden if you aren't staring at it or happen to be walking past as was the case with the wife and I.

I haven't been in tons of coffee houses in my day, but this one is probably the coolest one I've seen yet.  The place is very laid back and pretty unique.  There is a giant coffee roaster thing towards the back which looks like an antique (I think) that they still use to roast all their coffees.  I would venture a guess and say there aren't many places around that use such a machine so that is neat.  Actually I am really not that into the coffee scene so I really have no idea.  I just know that the place is pretty cool.  Could use more big comfy couches though.

I ordered an iced sugar free vanilla late and it was excellent.  The quality of their coffee really shows as it is strong and flavorful but not too overpowering.  My wife had a standard coffee with one of their super special limited-quantity roasts.  She loved it because she is a coffee snob but I thought it was just ok.  We also picked up a bag of their coffee to take home and it smells delicious and I can't wait to brew it.

Anyway, this is a great little independent coffee shop with excellent service and a very relaxed atmosphere.  Tempe is lucky to have it and all coffee snobs out there should definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"This is a very trendy and comfortable coffee house. I spent hours their today and it was my first time in. The menu is nothing but the basics, lattes, espresso, mocha, and fresh brewed to order cups of coffee. It's unique because they brew each cup of coffee when you order it. It doesn't sit in a coffee still for hours waiting to be pored then consumed, so in other words the coffee never tasted \"burnt.\" If you have some time to kill and need a creative place to sit then stop in."}
{"text":"subpar experience, barista more engaged with his pals and made an assumption that we were not \"cool enough\" to take our drinks to go. basically felt like he didn't want us to hang around"}
{"text":"Cute little place that had a very chill vibe. My cold brew coffee from draft was great, and there were plenty of plug ins so that I could successfully type away with a few hours of homework that I had to do!"}
{"text":"Local organic chia tea is a must. Great indie coffee shop. And the guys who run it are customer focused. I'll be back whenever I fly SWA."}
{"text":"This might be the only truly excellent coffeeshop in the entire greater Phoenix area.  they are serious about their coffee and don't screw around, so you should want that if you are going to go.  I understand how it might not be your scene if you just walked in the door.  I went on a mission to find this place while in town briefly, had a great dry cap, left very satisfied."}
{"text":"Addicted to Cartel's cold brew -- absolutely wonderful coffee, fantastic atmosphere, and the baristas are very friendly. Can't recommend it enough"}
{"text":"Best coffee around, in my opinion.  I've had friends that have worked for Cartel and they have nothing but good things to say about the company.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love the coffee and teas here!! Low key place with a good feel. Cool, Mello, and quality drinks, what more can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"The lovely and talented Baristas of Cartel-namely Kelsey and Chrysteena were a joy during my layover. Both were inspiring and educational! Not to mention the impeccable coffee. Thanks for being the brightest part of my day."}
{"text":"macchiato was really good. quirky and nice open coffee shop"}
{"text":"I have always liked Cartel since living in Tempe. But not that I live in Phoenix I am glad there is one closer to me, I am also happy that they extended their hours. The coffee is great and the food is pretty good too. I had a veggie breakfast burrito the other day and I have to say it was really good. 

They are committed to awesome coffee and I love that."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoyed this place the 2 times I was here, but I just tried to order an espresso macchiato to go and the guy behind the counter said its company policy to not provide an espresso shot or espresso macchiato in a to-go cup, which seems like a ridiculous policy for an airport coffee shop."}
{"text":"Only two things could make this place better.
1. parking that was longer than 1 hour
2. more than one couch for comfortable seating

The smell when you walk in is divine.  Tried the cold brew and a poptart.  Cost was less than $10 for breakfast and it was delicious!  Also, customer service is on point."}
{"text":"I first went to Cartel over the summer and was impressed more with the concept then the execution. The bar was just inside the entrance, the loungey area nothing more than a couple of sofas. Plus I don't drink coffee and they didn't have much else.

Went back for the Yelp Office Hours this month and am a new fan. They've moved the bar to the center of the space and the open space makes all the difference. Also have quirky art around the walls, some nice tables and the same sofas which now seem more inviting.

Add free wi-fi and hot chocolate to this list of praises and I've found a new \"escaping from work, but still working\" place."}
{"text":"Worst. Coffee. Experience. Ever...  sorry guys... bad coffee and music was so loud I couldn't work/hear/concentrate. Way pricey for tiny cup. Portland or isn't even that $$"}
{"text":"Best coffee place ever. I go there 3-4 times a week.
I like the pour over coffee. they do direct trade and roast their own beans.
This is a very unpretenious place with plenty of room.
It's very much anti-starbucks.
Sorry they wont have the favourite drink of their customer of the week posted.
The Barrista's are very passionate about their coffee here.
Nicco (spelling?) and others are great!"}
{"text":"I really like Cartel. Not only do they have great coffees and teas, all of their locations have a great vibe and service is typically outstanding. It's pretty darn cool what they did with this space in an old, architecturally dull retail center that is anchored by the best Buffalo Exchange in the state. Their interior design team excels in creating ultra cool, functional and simpliplistic environments that are great for working or chilling. Being within walking distance of ASU, this particular location seems geared for future students, current students and others that still wish they were students. Overall, I prefer their central Phoenix location the most, but this spot is pretty excellent."}
{"text":"Great coffee and space. I may have just caught them on a bad day, but the staff is not super friendly and makes you feel like an idiot if you are not a coffee snob."}
{"text":"A cool, industrial space with an emphasis on reclaimed wood and metal in a section of Old Town dedicated to touristy gift shops and jewelry stores.  The staff here are meticulous about their coffee and take the upmost care when preparing your hot, caffeinated elixir.  Ordering a cup here is not without a series of decisions to make.  First you have to pick from a dizzying list of single origin beans.   Next, you define your preferred brewing method, which include Aeropress, Hario, Chemex or Clever.  Then sit back and wait as they work their magic.  Truly great coffee, and this is coming from someone who has access to the very best in SF."}
{"text":"2 pour overs, strong cofee 1 scone, tasty 18 airport dollars.  Not bad food/coffee but prices were too much.  I avoid airport lounges for this reason."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee! Great staff and a top rate enviroment."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place! The barista was a ball of love. He was the best, he was basically an artist in the little coffee mug. My coffee was so refreshing and delicious.  Everyone should check this gem out."}
{"text":"A little overpriced, but decent double dirty chai. I went here with a friend after seeing the great reviews. I enjoyed my drink, but my friend hated her Iced Americana. She took it back and the baristas were awesome and kindly gave here an iced coffee instead. Unfortunately, she hated the coffee too, but we  figured it must be their roast that she doesn't like. As for my double dirty chai, I've had better, but this one wasn't bad. I don't think I'll go back though, because of the price... just not really worth frequenting. I'm still giving it three stars for the great service."}
{"text":"To me, a neighborhood is complete only after they have: a great coffee shop, a great neighborhood bar, and 3 or 4 small/cheap/good food places. Cartel, Casey Moores and Ottos all occupy the same block and hit all three catagories.

Cartel is hands down the best coffee I've ever had in Arizona.  Great atmosphere too. The prices are absurdly cheap to the point that I worry about them making a profit. I took my coffee snob friend there who was very cynical about it before going but now declares it the best he's had. Make sure you support this place."}
{"text":"Taking another cross-country road trip and stopped in Scottsdale for a cup of coffee and not just any coffee, they know how to brew and in many different manners of brewing! Pick your coffee (they have a \"green\" buyer), add to the a roaster with over a decade of experience, baristas that know how to prepare your coffee (the final stage can make or break that cup of morning/afternoon madness) and you have yourself a \"great cup of joe\".

A few fun snacks; soft pretzels, crazy cookies (forget you are \"dieting\"), scones, etc. Funky music in the background, 4 large communal tables and side couch with small tables if you want some alone time all works together. Easy free wi-fi (hate to get a code, type in some mysterious 17 digit code that never seems to work until after 22 tries) and pretty fast, too! 

It is not your dad's coffee place, so if you want a quiet, soft chair place to read your newspaper, this in not your place. Perhaps pick it up to go! This is a jolt of absolute heaven! If you want Nescafe stay home in your easy-rest sofa.

{"text":"The chai was pretty good, but not my favorite since it wasn't as flavorful as it could've been. One of the employees was very nice and attentive while the other completely ignored me and was very hipster snobby. I mainly like to spend a few hours at coffee shops studying and I don't think I'll bother coming back with better options out there."}
{"text":"Really outstanding coffee in an interesting space with a good vibe. 

Clearly they care a lot about quality and presentation, but they may want to dial back the pretension a notch.  I was told cappuccino is only served in a ceramic cup because of some incomprehensible reason of style or whatever, and only a latte could be taken out in a paper cup.  Ok, then, please make my to-go latte a very dry one. How hard was that?  Minus one star."}
{"text":"Craft brew coffee in an airport? YES. For me, this is the coolest thing in Phoenix's airport. It's one of the only craft brew coffee houses in an airport in the United States, overall it's 4.5 stars.

They have cold brew, espresso drinks, teas, baked goods and pre-packaged food that you can take on the plane.  There are different brew methods to pick from... Aeropress (8 oz), Hario V60 (12 oz), Clever (16 oz), Chemex (20 oz). Prices for all drinks are reasonable.  

Cold Brew - Good strong flavor, they used a Mexican bean (LDC Chiapas) for this one when I was there. 

Latte - Very good, strong with a thick milky froth. Highly recommended.

Cappuccino - I was going to order this but was told that they only do espresso drinks in real cups for sit down orders only. They do not do cappuccinos in to go cups, which is why they recommended a small latte to me. 

The only thing I was bummed about was that I couldn't get a cappuccino to go. I know coffee making is a craft and espressos take time to make, but we are in an airport. People are on the go and I'm sure there are others that want a high quality espresso hit while trying to run over to their next gate to catch a transfer. Other than that gripe, I don't have any complaints about their bean or brew quality.  

Yes, you can find V60 drip, espressos and cold brew coffees in an airport, you just have to hit up Phoenix and be near the Southwest Airlines gates in Terminal 4."}
{"text":"This was the best espresso I've ever had in Phoenix.  It was sweet, not bitter, full of flavor and had a great aftertaste.  The beans were roasted lightly, just like I like my coffee.  Staff was friendly and accommodating.

My only complaint is that the music being played wasn't a style I like.  So what?  I'm here for the coffee."}
{"text":"I love Cartel.  I really do think they're amongst the best roasters in the country.  While living in Tucson, I went there 4-5 times a week, and if you have a Cartel by you, you should give them a shot.  

Yes, they serve food and tea.  Drink the coffee.  They're expert coffee roasters, baristas (& dare I say...coffee snobs) and it shows in the end product."}
{"text":"Ever want to hang out with friends at a brewery but not feeling beer? Cartel has that atmosphere with their home roasted breans and fresh brewed coffee. No nitro, but don't let that stop you from having quality coffee with community friendly atmosphere! They even got specialties (day I visited they have PBJ affagato )"}
{"text":"Cartel is a great place to go for a good cup of joe. Okay I actually don't drink coffee but I have heard that the coffee there is amazing. They do make a mean cup of iced tea and some tasty italian sodas. The place is a little small but has really high ceilings and a really nice atmosphere for having a good chat with a friend or getting a little studying done."}
{"text":"A couple of years ago, I ordered a couple bags of Brazil pulped bourbon Single Origin Espresso from Cartel and really enjoyed it.  Made a great capp/latte - tasted like pure molasses in milk.  When visiting the Phoenix area this past week, I made sure to stop by Cartel for a couple double espressos and some beans.

The espresso (85% Guatemala Chicupac 15% El Salvador Los Andes) was sweet with notes of citrus and tobacco.  Good, syrupy body.  Espresso preparation was top notch.  The people there were friendly and happy to talk about the coffee and engage patrons about what they were tasting.  Really unique cafe - interesting artwork, and its located in an unassuming strip mall. Definitely would keep coming back (if I lived in Tempe....) They are roasting top notch coffees - and I really appreciate that they give all the informations on their beans (growing region/estate, elevation, composition of blends).  They can do that because the source awesome beans and let them speak for themselves."}
{"text":"Definitely \"hipster-esque,\" as other reviews have mentioned. I love coffee. But to be honest, the cup I had was lackluster. The beans were a bit over roasted and then over brewed. I could taste the heavy bitterness of both. Their iced coffee is supposedly the sam-dizzily, but I really don't like iced coffee. So, I'm outta luck.  I also had the strawberry pop tart. Then crust was really dry and practically fell apart in my hands and mouth. I think it had been sitting there too long. Not sure this is the \"hidden gem\" others have claimed. :-/"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and puts Starbucks to shame. Would return in a heartbeat if we lived here."}
{"text":"Airport coffee, even top names in the business, lack the lister of their local compatriots. If this is true of Cartel Coffee Cartel, I need to go to one of their local stores. I savored a delicious 8ounce Americano as I awaited my next flight and was disappointed to discover that I didn't have time to return to their location to purchase coffee to take home: smooth, rich, and finely crafted.  I am so glad I did not dump any cream or sugar in it. It was perfect. 
This coffee is more expensive than others but you get more flavor and it is more satisfying. I even noticed some mugs available for those who could linger. Options are provided for different crafting of coffee. 
The staff was friendly and patient as I had to seek out my wallet. They were able to help other customers and I did not feel rushed. I will be checking out their online store--and may just make sure my next flight goes through Phoenix instead of Denver or Chicago :)"}
{"text":"Watching them make the coffee is what made me give them 5 stars. 

The atmosphere is very laid back with a very cozy kind of layout. The people are very nice and the cappuccino is definitely on point. You can't take it to go bc of the art of the foam made on top and I think that is amazing. This place is truly a great coffee shop and this is their second location I found out and hopefully they will keep adding more. It's great and will definitely come back every chance I get back in Arizona"}
{"text":"With the exception of a few diligent baristas, this coffee shop has terrible service. Many a time have I had my order botched and have been given sneering, condescending looks from the the employees. Inherently, the coffee is excellent. So are the pastries and savory items. One time I ordered an iced nonfat milk latte and the barista made it with whole milk and when I politely asked her if it was made with nonfat milk she exclaimed, \"here is a lonely latte for anyone that wants it.\" This is beyond criticism. I could just as easily go to Starbucks across the street but come here on the recommendation of friends and family. I want to believe that this place is good but the service is wholly inconsistent and truthfully, it is not worth the hassle. If it were possible to give less than one star, I would. So even this one is a gift. I really wish management was more on top of employees. I am already telling all of my friends not to come here. Please change my mind."}
{"text":"An awesome places for real coffee.  They have a great selection.  Loved the homemade poptart.  Cool and funky atmosphere."}
{"text":"Coffee is really good here and they have the fancy designs and lots of choices to make as well. Light snacks is available as well as some choices for those with the sweet tooth. The service is good but it depends on the day. Sometimes the servers are not good or friendly & do not know how to do the fancy design on the drinks. They should also be more conscientious about cleaning after a customer. It's dirty & needs wiping down. But the coffee is great!!!"}
{"text":"I actually had Cartel coffee before when I was exploring Phoenix on a free Saturday and tried it inadvertently at the Phoenix Public Market Cafe with an overgrown bowl of yogurt and granola (review: http://bit.ly/2E6LwKI). Obviously I remembered the rich taste enough to be mildly pleased to discover this kiosk among the Southwest gates in Terminal 4. Yes, I have been brainwashed to default to Starbucks whenever I'm in cities and especially in airports where I make a blind grasp at brand familiarity before I fly into the blue yonder. This time I took advantage of their wide selection of caffeine (photo: http://bit.ly/2BHlPvj).

Upon quick perusal, I ordered a $5.75 Latte which contained a good boost of their espresso (photo: http://bit.ly/2rYZRUO). It definitely fulfilled the promise of the coffee I had before and then some. It appears they have quite a selection of beans for sale in what looked to be a standard travel size (photo: http://bit.ly/2DPPwfu). They even offer counter seating if you don't mind a gushing flood of foot traffic inches from your face as it's out in the terminal passageway (photo: http://bit.ly/2BIq1Lf). So it appears the Starbucks circle can be broken - at least if I take Southwest which I usually do from Phoenix.

COFFEE - 4 stars...use of a local roastery made a discernible difference in flavor
AMBIANCE - 4 stars...nice compact set-up for an airport operation
SERVICE - 4 stars...quality emphasized so procrastination is your problem
TOTAL - 4 stars...will the Starbucks circle be unbroken?...amen to the yes"}
{"text":"Another cool coffee shop in central Phoenix.  The atmosphere is cool and relaxing, the staff is friendly and helpful and the fresh brewed iced tea was delicious and just what I needed on a hot day."}
{"text":"Grabbed a coffee here today with a couple friends. Had an \"Iced Toddy\", which is their iced coffee. It was fabulous! 

Cool atmosphere. I loved the decor and local art. Will definitely stop by next time I am in Tempe and have a craving for some coffee. :)"}
{"text":"The coffee was good although they had cold brew in a warm container. The lemon pound cake was a tad stale, but again, edible. The service was fine but not inspired.  Are you getting the pattern? Maybe it was because it was near noon when we stopped in before taking in a movie but with all the great coffee places, Cartel's initial success might be getting the better of them."}
{"text":"WOW! What a treat to find this coffee spot in the Southwest Terminal at the Phoenix Airport! We had delicious hand-poured Chemex coffee (worth the wait if you aren't rushing to a flight). Also had sweet-corn cookies (which I believe they bring in from a local bakery).  YUM!! 

I didn't think this place was any more expensive than Starbucks...and so much better!!"}
{"text":"Coffee is boss. Go there when you want damn good coffee and food."}
{"text":"The earthiest, most delicious late that I ever had and repeatedly have at this coffee place. And then, there are at least three different rooms/areas  that anyone can sit and enjoy their coffee. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is really great! I and one of the few place that won't break ur bank account in the airport. I love coffee but now I can only drink decafe. Which has really suck in until I found this place. I have a feeling this Wil be my coffee shop every time I go to Phoenix... Thanx guys for making a great cup of coffee and come to L.A. and Charleston, SC"}
{"text":"Stopped in as a second choice to grab a couple of sandwiches for the trip home. Prices were very fare, given that it's in the airport. The staff was nice - I had the Tuna on Ciabatta and it was very good. The price was $7 - compared to $12 for a ready made sandwich just two doors down (and what caused us to make them our 2nd choice...) Had I gotten to the airport earlier, I would have tried their coffee. As an independent restaurant/coffee vendor, give these folks your love if you're ever passing through PHX Terminal 4 / Gate C (Southwest) - Good job & thank you!"}
{"text":"the thing i like about this place this the quality. this is the only place in az i've been to that has a coffee selection that would still qualify it as an elite coffee shop in cal and the northwest. i've been going to cartel since a week after it opened and its gotten a lot busier since then and so sometimes there is a wait. some employs are not very knowledgeable, but many are quite knowledgeable. the prices are ridiculously cheap. i don't think they serve a cup of coffee that is more than 4 dollars. the espresso is also delightful.

i have to say the one thing cartel does better than any coffee shop i have been to is make an iced coffee. most nice coffee shops either don't serve an iced coffee or serve it without much care. the iced toddy at cartel is extremely delicious. of course, the hot coffee and espresso are still the stars of the place, but the ice coffee is probably the most unique part of the cartel experience.

recently (within the last 6 months) they have expanded the seating considerably, added lots of outlets, and improved the wifi. so, its a really easy place to plug in your laptop now."}
{"text":"the coffee quality is as stellar here as the tempe location. they moved the clover here too. they serve a 12oz  from the clover in a ceramic cup and pair it with something to eat. for example, i had the finca la illusion with a clementine (its amazing btw). its a little bit more pricey than the drip from tempe cartel (the coffee i had was the most expensive by a dollar or two and it was five dollars). they were also pouring some single origin espresso when i was there which was cool. i don't know if they are regularly going to have some other espresso in addition to the black market. i think those are the major notably difference in the products they are serving.

they do not roast at this location, but they do carry all the coffees they have in tempe. i beleive, like in tempe, they sell bags of coffee and they will grind the beans for whatever device you use if you want them to. the location is smaller than the tempe cartel and a bit more upscale. it also seems like it is less crowded than the tempe location (to be fair, i came in on new years eve so i don't know how representative that is). all and all, really awesome. probably a better coffee experience than the tempe location, but the hours are much more restrictive."}
{"text":"Was disappointed. Employee was not helpful but felt like she was silently making mean comments in her head. The coffee was good though.
So if you enjoy good coffee and ehhh customer service, this might be the place. 

Happy enjoying the coffee."}
{"text":"This place is truly just above average of what you would expect for a coffee shop. Small, quaint and has delicious coffee. Nothing really to write about here. The staff was awesome, the small bar stool seats outside were comfy... that's all I got. This place is more like a coffee stand, so what can you expect other than great service and delicious coffee? I say, nothing! Thank you."}
{"text":"No doubt that the coffee was excellent- but the barista was rude and very cantankerous, despite attempts at being friendly. Not to mention the bathroom was out of toilet paper and just had a sign that said 'sorry- public bathrooms available down the street'. I wish I could give a better review since their coffee is great- but the experience was lackluster."}
{"text":"Great salads like the Super Food and the Rainbow.

Vegan, vegetarian options at the airport in the Southwest Airlines gate C terminal.

Crowded but quick. Seating full but airport was also packed.

Great grab and go salads. Sandwiches looked good but was on a detox day.

My next layover in Phoenix. We will return."}
{"text":"Really great cappuccino, more European style than American so even the large is very small. The cookie I got was pretty hard and not particularly flavorful. The vibe seems very hip, and the coffee shop was really crowded on a weekday afternoon, but there was no line and the wait was very manageable"}
{"text":"Awesome Iced Coffee AKA iced Toddie (Toddy) using a cold brew process that doesn't pull the acids and bitterness out of the bean and leaves a smooth, rich and fruity cup of iced goodness. The crew formerly of Solas Coffee really provides top notch service. Snap up a chocolate chip and bacon cookie or a slice of the coffee cake that rocks. Cappuccinos and Macchiattos are for drinking in and have well crafted foam. If your looking for a super sweet 1100 calorie Fat-a-chino.. keep driving to Starbucks and sip on some burnt bean lates. Know, if you want a smooth well crafted cup drip coffee made for you or rich espresso, come see the crew at Cartel Scottsdale. They also have the OG Tempe, new downtown with kitchen and Tucson location (former ally Avenue Coffee)."}
{"text":"For my first review of 2018, let's start off with a banger!!! Get ready for some fun with this one. 

Let's be honest for a minute. The price of coffee (which I don't drink) or tea isn't getting any cheaper. But $4.25 plus tax for some water and mediocre tasting tea is absolutely insane to me. Starbucks for a size twice what I got is half the price...At freakin Starbucks!!!! Before you think I'm cheap or whatever, check my pics from the meals I ate and this actually has little to with price or money. I also secretly hate Starbucks.

One it took forever to get tea. Not hard to make, right?  Fair warning I was told it would be a few minutes. Whatever. I asked if they have honey. They said no, they only have agave and some nonsense flavored corn syrup out of a pump. How do you not have honey at a place like this?

Two stars for the decent atmosphere and crappy chairs. Although I'm curious about whatever is doing on their laptops...mmmm? Plus a lot of the light bulbs were burnt out and that drives me crazy because it lacks attention to detail. It's not that hard to change a light bulb. 

I'm not sure if their rent is high or the workers/owners are, but this is all insane to me. 

This review might sound mean but some of the foundational things in my mind are missing."}
{"text":"V60 pour over is pretty amazing. You don't see sun dry process beans often. Among the 3 coffee shops I tried while visiting Phoenix, this is by far the best. I'm not familiar with the local coffee culture, but I truly thought this would be a rather disappointing trip till I came to Cartel. Brought back two bags of beans with me. I will update the review once I try those two."}
{"text":"Although different than the traditional coffee shop, cartel, is arguably the best coffee shop downtown. They take more time making each cup, and thus the quality is increased but the wait is also increased. I would wager that as cartel grows in popularity the wait will become unbearable, much like Matt's big (slow) breakfast."}
{"text":"Simple, but efficient

I didn't really know what to expect from this place. My friend has been hyping it for weeks, so I finally decided to check it out. I loved the vibe when I walked in. It was, surprisingly \"hipstery\"? (Is that a word?) but pleasant. It was definitely nothing like the typical Starbucks or other coffee chains. The menu was basic and to the point, and I didn't feel overwhelmed by the number if choices or fillers that a lot of other places I've visited. The iced green tea I had was outstanding. Overall, I was happy with my visit. Ill definitely be back"}
{"text":"BEST COFFEE EVER! ...Wait, BEST COFFEE PLACE EVER!

This is the type of coffee spot I've always wanted to find but never could. My search is over (kind of...I wish it was closer to me). You can tell that Cartel is passionate about their product. They put quality first, and it's evident in the flavor of the espresso, roast, grind, milk, steam, pour, etc. Therefore the finished product is always a masterpiece. The service is great too. I'd move into the place if they let me."}
{"text":"Their coffee is amazing. The staff was friendly.  The place was very cool decorated.  Would love to come back to have another one soon."}
{"text":"Cartel is a Tempe classic. I've been going here since I was in high school, and it honestly hasn't changed much at all. It's a super hipster coffee shop with an industrial interior. It's certainly a hot spot for people to do homework and catch up on work, so good luck finding a spot to sit when you go! 

Personally, I love to get a dirty chai, which is a chai latte with a couple shots of espresso added. The flavor is amazing and the texture is creamy and delicious, but it still gives you that kick of energy from the espresso. Coffee is really an art at cartel, and you can taste the difference. 

It is a little pricey, but then again, it's an art. You definitely pay for the love that they put into your drink. Sometimes the people that work there can be a little snobby about the coffee - friends I know that aren't super into coffee and prefer PSL's from starbucks have been a little put off by the customer service there. However, that's not always the case and the last time I went I was very impressed with the customer service and how helpful the guy at the register was to my non-coffee drinking friend.

All in all, Cartel is a solid coffee shop with delicious coffee and tea. Try doing some homework there one afternoon and enjoy the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Their coffee has one of the more unique flavors I have tried, and it is very good. I tried to mocha as well and loved it. The customer service is very friendly and the interior decoration is both very pleasing and very comfortable."}
{"text":"Meh. Pretty locations. Cartel used to be a haven for coffee, now it's pretty sub par compared to most shops in the valley. Old equipment + uninspired menu. Cold brew seems to have taken a nosedive from its former glory when baristas made it. Kegged, metallic, lifeless, with a price increase. Advice; buy whole bean, brew at home."}
{"text":"Had a dirty chai latte. It was expensive as heck, but it was so good I sometimes find myself craving another one. 

But I don't live in Arizona, so I guess I'll have to keep dreaming. 

The atmosphere in this place is chill, and kind of inspiring I feel like it's the type of place where I would have some serious epiphanies."}
{"text":"I happened across this place when I was randomly invited over for an expression shot by a group of Weebly employees while walking past them on the street on my way to Chop Shop. 

Only stopped in real quick for the shot and to chat with my new friends but I was impressed with the small space. We don't have any cafes like that in Utah. The shots of sparkling water prior to the espresso shots is a nice touch."}
{"text":"It's one of those off brand coffee places. They brew the coffee fresh and in front of your eyes. I ordered a black tea cause wasn't feeling coffee this morning and it was kinda cool to see them brew it. They also had this amazing selection of pastries. They had muffins, cookies and scones and all looked delicious! I opted for the muffin. Cranberry white chocolate to be exact. Not a big cranberry fAn but it looked so good I had to try it and boy was it good. Very moist but kinda crunchy on the top not too sweet just perfect and hit the spot! Next time I'm through here I will definitely have to stop. I might just take a pit stop here from now on. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good coffee and pastry.  Atmosphere is relaxed hipster.  Bathroom needs a lot of attention."}
{"text":"I hear this place has the best coffee, ever. I haven't tasted it yet. Mainly because I don't really drink coffee. But I plan on going back and giving it a shot. I had a hot cocoa, which was good, but not nearly chocolatey enough for me (i have a twisted, gluttonous perception of how chocolatey things 'should be,' however), and some of their freshly-made truffles which were DELISH. 

It would be nice if they were open earlier and later. I really enjoy the ambience of the place... it's like your best buddy constructed a bitchin little coffee cart in their super hip warehouse loft or something."}
{"text":"While leaving PHX I stumbled on this place.  Amazing coffee.  The staff love what they do and you can taste it.  I'm a coffee snob and this place exceeds expectations."}
{"text":"Does it really take 1 hour to make ONE coffee? This was my first time at cartel, the coffee was good but they gave me the wrong cup of coffee and asked if I would be okay with that coffee instead...after I said no I want the coffee I ordered they took 45 mins to make it. I completely understand it was busy but my order should have been priority. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Sweet little hidden gem in Tempe.  Now THIS is a coffee shop I want to hang out in. 
Very hipster, very cool. People know it's your first time when you walk in."}
{"text":"High octane coffee. They don't have a dark roast which is a Bummer but staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Amazingly DELICIOUS- the atmosphere was so inviting and had that coffeehouse feel to it. It was my first time there. I ordered an ice breve latte and I have to say, hands down - it was the best coffee I've had for awhile. I wish ahwatukee was a location thought for Cartel"}
{"text":"A lab means science and this joint takes coffee to the next level. I learned in Chemistry class that proper measurement yields the best result. Cartel's hand crafted coffee is delightful. And strong. Careful, their brews are pure and robust.

Suggest you give Cartel a try --"}
{"text":"Great coffee in an airport, almost too good to be true! They do pour overs in four different methods and have a variety of coffees to choose from. Can't ask for much more than this."}
{"text":"If I can describe this place in one word I would say it's cool , thx to there coffee machine that make the place smell like real coffee place 
The coffee is a little burn but good enough for college ppl that just come for a nice cup of coffee 
So compare to Starbucks ( the worse coffee in the world) I would say this place is good 
They need to crate a smaller seating area ( more tables ) instead of big area that you have no where to sit"}
{"text":"Great Coffee and even better staff.  There are too many coffee shops with rude or unfriendly staff.  That is not the case here.  They are extremely helpful and friendly.  The \"pop-tart\" is delishous!"}
{"text":"We had heard that this place was great, so we decided to give it a try. I ordered an iced mocha, which was done pretty quickly and it was quite good.  My husband on the other hand enjoys brewed coffee.  They do it differently here and you can't just order a large coffee.  He tried to ask some questions of the staff, but the woman was less than helpful. She answered very minimally in a way that was not helpful at all and we were even more confused. She acted a little annoyed that we were not coffee connoisseurs and had to ask questions. After all that, our bill was $11 for two coffees! And their brewed coffee was pretty disgusting.  They also do not have great seating for a coffee shop."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to get some work done at a downtown coffee shop and stumbled into this place.  Being new to Phoenix, we hadn't heard of it.  Super happy we ended up here.  Cool decor, very courteous and laid-back staff, plenty of seating.  Wish they were open later on Saturdays.  Ah well.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Without match, the best coffee I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. They know exactly how to create a great cup, and it usually relies on simplicity. My first time in, I ordered an Americano. I asked if they'd give me a splash of soy. The barista said it would be no problem and suggested that I steam it first (if I didn't mind.) When someone knows what they are doing, I take their suggestion. He foamed up the soy milk and created this amazingly simple but phenomenal cup of coffee. As I waited for my flight with a friend, I realized how often I kept saying under my breath \"oh my god, this is a great cup of coffee.\" It's my go to stop when I fly out of Sky Harbor. I'm gonna admit, Cartel, I've scheduled morning flights just so I could get my coffee from you."}
{"text":"What a cool little place tucked away behind a strip mall.  Would never have found this if it was not suggested by a good friend who raved about the cappuccino!  He is world traveler, so, it's a  must try if it's the best cup he's ever had.  He was right!  Don't know if it's in the beans or the care that they take to make it with a fab froth decoration on top.  My hubby and I loved the caramel brulee taste..  My son loved the hot \"warm\" cocoa.  Yeah, we walked in as a family last night and almost everyone turned our way since we did not fit the hip college crowd.  Everyone was really friendly, though. The sweet young man behind the counter gave my son some micro cinnamon doughnuts and scored major points with the little dude!   We will be back."}
{"text":"Coffee good, thought a bit expensive; but then, it's right in the middle of Scottsdale 'Old Town,' so guess that's not too surprising -- rents must be horrendous!"}
{"text":"Great pour over coffee. Interesting hipster vibe. Loved that they were roasting it on site."}
{"text":"Been here once. It's good. Not super great. I want to try it again to make a better review of the coffee. But it was ok. I was not like holy crap I need to come every morning and get me some...

I think it is over priced, low flavor coffee. It's just a place for trust fund hipster geeks in their vintage trendy gear with iPhones and iMacs to ride their fixed gear bikes to and pretend they know good coffee and intelligent conversation! 

Sorry this is not good coffee. Good coffee does not have any bitterness to it. This coffee has a slight burnt taste to it. It's terrible. They don't even have raw sugar. Sorry I don't want to use syrup! Even if technically it's close to the same thing. It makes the coffee taste fucking worse! 

This place is a typical tempe JOKE! All the clueless college hipster crowd flocks here for something they have no clue about. If you want real coffee try this little place in scottsdale called Coffee roasters, its a hole in the wall that makes real coffee. Smooth ,flavorful. Roasted perfectly! 
Cartel is not the answer when it comes to coffee. Cool hipster nerd, I got tattoos a stupid fixed gear and s stupid attitude to go along with this all, then this is it!"}
{"text":"Not really very good coffee. Not smooth and not delicious at all. Very harsh. I did not enjoy it at all."}
{"text":"Yesterday afternoon I stopped into Cartel with a friend of mine to give them a second chance.  When we arrived the place was packed and loud.  I ordered a decaf Americano, which they couldn't do because they were out of decaf beans.  I consider this a major failure by the management.  I've never had this happen at any of the really good coffee places around town.  

I ended up settling for an iced tea and my friend and I sat down and talked for a bit.  We ended up chatting with one of the other patrons for a while, but eventually ended up cutting our stay short because the place was so incredibly loud and there were some kids running around the place that were getting on our nerves.  I think the acoustics aren't very good in there and it seems like everyone's conversation gets amplified and thrown right in your face.  Rather than yell, we just gave up and moved on.  

I have a feeling that Cartel will eventually end up being a great place, but based on my experience they need to work on their consistency.  The employees have seemed nice both times I've been there, but pouring a sour shot is unacceptable and so is running out of beans.  If they work on training their barristas and get their logistics together I am sure Cartel will eventually be a great place.  A little work on the acoustics of the place couldn't hurt, either.

I probably would have given them two stars, but we couldn't think of where to go after fleeing from Cartel and ended up at Starbucks.  For that, you get one star."}
{"text":"First coffee shop we tried in AZ! Gorgeous layout and super friendly people. I chose a random coffee from their list and it was surprisingly good! They also have beer tastings!"}
{"text":"Excellent brews to choose from, excellent customer service and excellent vibe.

My latte was not bitter in the least nor was the flavoring overpowering.

I look forward to this little \"lab\" growing in popularity. 

Maybe next time I'll get cozy on the couch on the other side of the espresso bar and have some quiet time.

I'm looking forward to (hopefully) extended hours. Or I won't be here often since schooling takes up my time during most of their open hours currently.

Hopefully this place will stick around. Local coffee houses struggle in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'll be honest.  I was hesitant to try this place after reading the mixed reviews on Yelp, but the nice girl at Tea Time down the street told me I should try it so I did.  The service has been very good, they take your plastic via Square which I love, and my hot green tea was very good served in a heavy glass tumbler (not the norm for sure).  The wifi connection is good/fast.  The music is a little heavy, but if you want a place to  unwind, you could do that here.  Not an uppity pretentious Scottsdale norm for sure.  I will come back if I have the chance."}
{"text":"Polite & friendly staff!
Coffee is decent
No one is chatting too intense for my taste"}
{"text":"The cartel has become my go-to coffee stop on Saturdays. They care about their product - carefully brewing their coffees and teas to rode an to perfection. They are well kitted with outlets and wifi which makes it a good productive environment and not too noisy. Lots of room since their expansion. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great cup in the early am. No short cuts. It's also easy to hear so a great spot for an early morning meeting. They have some type of partnership with Kaleidiscope so there are also great juices available and plenty of healthy food options. I've been a fan of the Tempe Cartel for a long time but this is a great downtown Phoenix location."}
{"text":"They really know what they are doing here. 
Educated and talented. 
If u want the highest quality coffee and service in Phoenix- Look no further. We had the Colombian 6 tier. Sooooo delicious."}
{"text":"Clay at Cartel coffee, makes the best cappuccino with a great design, Excellent Customer Service, from the entire Staff, and amazing coffee, I am a die hard Starbucks fan, but Cartel now won my wallet and tastebudzz! 
Am in the Airport once a week for my Fix!"}
{"text":"I am unimpressed. This is not a welcoming coffee house. There is nothing cozy here.

I am on a constant hunt for good chai. I didn't find it here. I know the company Cartel orders their mixes from makes a spicier chai. Based on other reviews it's either not ordered anymore or was ordered by accident before. The chai was pretty much all latte and hardly any chai.

They will pretty much assume any drink you order is to go. Not surprising because who would want to sit around on the ridiculously uncomfortable chair things? They are literally concrete blocks with bent metal for a back and a thin pad for the seat. Steal a pad or two from other chairs and don't try to lean back. Ouch ouch ouch."}
{"text":"So glad to know that there is a genuine, coffee for coffee sake-brewed for the individual- take time to investigate your flavor preference for coffee-slightly industrial slightly minimalistic jaunt, that is local, independent and worth repeat visits-kinda place in the Mill Ave District. 
Sure it gets crowded at times, that's the nature of the beast... on any given evening you can see local students, friends gathered cramming for med/art exams, families with toddlers delightfully playing with the dominoes (moms frantically scurrying to grab the haphazardly spewed pieces, and the darling kiddo shrieking with delight anticipating the 'do it again do it again' feeling...).. friends or strangers grabbing the chess board for a pensive game, strangers sitting parallel, surfing the free Wifi, or baristas sharing their passion and knowledge for the process and detail... (yes it's a lab, no there's not a quiz at the end of the coffee line). You can have your mocha and drink it too if u prefer.. (My one wish would be to have the option for big comfy latte size mugs for beverages (as one finds at 3 roots), whether sitting at the tables or lounging on the coffee colored leather sofa, i simply prefer a real ceramic mug, rather than the recyclable paper to go cups.. Here's to keeping the locally-owned coffee/tea vibe alive...3 roots and Cartel in the Mill Ave District. (sadly, Mill's End is a memory). 
To repeat Erik L.'s thoughts... Well, done!"}
{"text":"We've known this place has stellar coffee, but during our last stop, 2 of the baristas spent a lot of extra time showing us how to use the press for a great pull at home. They were so generous w their time and expertise. We bought a lb. of beans in addition to our usual lattes. The whole teach-a-man-to-fish was a special experience. Above and beyond here for sure. Thanks Cartel."}
{"text":"I have been to Cartel twice now- the first time was rather pleasant on a quiet Saturday morning. The coffee was good- definitely different from your mainstream chain coffee shops. The atmosphere was comfortable and I was able to catch up with a friend and relax there. 

The second time, I stopped in to purchase some coffee beans as gifts for my out of town relatives, thinking it would be a nice unique and local present. After choosing the type of coffee, my friend and I stood by the counter waiting to be acknowledged by the barista, who was chatting with a friend. 

We waited patiently for a greeting or an offer to ring up the coffee. The barista did not acknowledge us or even look our way even after his friend sat down. He started cleaning the bar instead. Finally he asked what he could do for us. I handed him the 3 bags of coffee and he rang me up. He swiped my card, flipped the iPad for me to sign and turned his back on me. I signed and grabbed my card he had tucked into the iPad stand, calling out a thank you.
He did not respond and chose to ignore any semblance of a polite customer interaction. 

Comparing my two experiences, I would say that your experience probably depends on when you stop in. There seem to be some really great reviews on this place.  Unfortunately for me, my bad experience outweighed my good one and it's just not worth it for me to return and spend my time and money there. 

I'm sad that I spend 40 dollars on some coffee beans that I'm rather embarrassed to give to my family, lest they stop in at this location when they are in town next and have a terrible customer service experience that I did."}
{"text":"Hipster coffee bar in the airport. 
Just ordered an iced coffee and it was on point. 
No frills, no other bullshit like Starbucks does. 
Customer service was uber friendly even when I looked like DEATH from waking up at 4 in the morning to pack and leave for my 6am flight. 

Love that they had the liquid sweetener for iced beverages too. 

yum!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Tempe hands down.

Cool little place too.

I used to work at a roaster and this place knows what's up.  Owner is a drummer too, so I like the place even better."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The staff was helpful and the coffee was delicious. A great place to meet friends or study!"}
{"text":"This is located in the Southwest area, which was perfectly convenient for me. The baristas here really work their butts off because there are lots of orders and they have to be fast. They do not compromise on quality though. I watched them make a large batch of drip coffee, pour ready-made cold brew, lattes, capps with speed and efficiency. Great service. I had a one and one, which took some time, but when it was ready, it was served on a nice platter with sparkling water just like in their non-airport locations. I liked the one with a dash of milk more, but both got me awake without making me jittery. Limited seating around the coffee shop itself."}
{"text":"Small, but chill place that serves their own roasts. If you buy a bag, you get a free 12 oz drip. Of course picked up a few bags when I was visiting. The latte is also very good and creamy. The space is connected to an office building and another eatery. A few bar stools inside. Service is excellent. The music selection the few times I came here was kinda spooky."}
{"text":"Finally, a coffee place you can brag about going to.

Cartel is an intelligent coffee shop with trendy decor and knowledgeable baristas. I feel good about being there, like I've chosen wisely for not going to a run-of-the-mill coffee-bucks type establishment. Though I sometimes feel out of my element because I don't know a lot about coffee, I've always been treated with courteous and attentive customer service.

By the way, major bonus points for using an iPad to place orders and being able to text or email you the receipt. Why don't more places do that?

The Espresso is strong with a solid kick and does the trick. I like how they serve it in a mug instead of a paper cup. The Chai Latte is also phenomenal. As good, if not better than ones I've had elsewhere.  I'm impressed by the various coffee beans and accessories they offer too. I even purchased the Aeropress so I can make coffee like them (and because of the great reviews: http://www.amazon.com/Aerobie-AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0047BIWSK). *Be sure to buy it from the store, though*

Looking forward to trying out their food and BEER selections soon. But, even if they only served coffee, I'd be more than happy.

Definitely check out their Tempe location for a very hipster hole-in-the-wall ambiance that reminds me of drinking coffee in a place like Chicago or NYC: http://www.yelp.com/biz/cartel-coffee-lab-tempe"}
{"text":"The location in Scottsdale is great, but this one is better.

They serve up some of the best coffee, espresso and chai tea lattes you could ask for. Based near Mill Ave, it fits right in with that artsy stores nearby and has that \"renovated garage\" hipster look.

Speaking of renovated, they just expanded into two huge new sections! One side offers more lounge seating where you should be able to start ordering craft beer. It's always been there, but now it looks like people are getting used to actually using it more often. The west side wall is gone which opens up a large area for additional seating, cartwheels and lots of other activities. I'm looking forward to seeing how they decorate and update this place, my favorite coffee shop in AZ."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever being at Cartel coffee . The coffee was bitter and acidic from the first drink/taste till the half of cup that I attempted to drink . Every time I took a drink I thought it would get better . It did not . They say Alton Brown loves Cartel Coffee , I would say Alton Brown is a nut job . Hands down the worst cup of coffee I have every had . I buy my coffee from Superstition Coffee in queen creek . The staff was nice , but the coffee left me with something to be desired . I never write yelp reviews but I thought this one needed to be written . The coffee just tasted like it was old ."}
{"text":"Delicious roasted flavor, reminds me of the incredible coffee I had while visiting Chennai, India"}
{"text":"This place serves the second best coffee I've had in the United States, behind Cafe Vivace in Seattle. They have forgotten more about making espresso than most people will ever know. 

Some people will complain that they can't get their favorite mint mocha caramel skinny soy latte here, or that they won't let them ruin a cappuccino by sucking it through a hole in a to-go cup, but this is not the coffee shop for that kind of person.  Cartel is not Burger King. It's not \"your way right away\", it's \"their way or the highway.\" They know their way. If you appreciate super high quality espresso and properly steamed milk in a real cappuccino, this is the ONLY place for you. No place else in Phoenix comes even close. Places like Lux and Goldbar are nice enough, but not even on the same planet as Cartel when it comes to the quality of the coffee.

Others complain about the slow service. It is slow, but it's slow for a reason. The barista makes each order start to finish with no shortcuts before starting on the next order. No pre-ground coffee, ever. No letting espresso sit around, even for a few seconds. No re-using old, already steamed milk. Regular coffee is made one cup at a time using just-ground beans and a Hario filter and cone, with water temperature controlled to precisely 206F. It takes a while, but you get something that's the best the barista can deliver. A big difference from the mediocre crap served at the typical coffee shop. 

I think this is my favorite part of Cartel. They do not pander to the lowest common denominator. They do the best they can, all the time, even if some of their customers don't get it.  

The only possible complaint I have is that most of their roasted coffee is South American, and they seem to like to bring out the fruity notes that those coffees have when they roast. There can be a little bit of sameness there, at least for me. I would prefer more variety in the regions the coffee beans come from, and a larger variety in flavor profiles."}
{"text":"I retract my previous statements about Cartel's ambiance. The \"garage\" has grown on me. Not only do I not mind hanging out here, I love it! I find myself coming back time and time again. It's a combination of the location, the baristas, and some of the best coffee in Tempe. If I could kiss you Cartel, I would. And I'd make it wet."}
{"text":"Seriously, I have never enjoyed the pure, unadulterated taste of true coffee as I have at Cartel. My cappuccino was enjoyed sans sugar, flavoring, artificial sweetener.... everything. And it was so, so delightful. But it did not last nearly long enough :(

The place is so quaint and has a mom-and-pop, college atmosphere Starbucks or any other chain lacks. There are only a  few choices of drinks to choose from but.... it proves they are purists. And they do it RIGHT. All of it. 

Baked goods are out of this world (hello butterscotch cookie with white chocolate)."}
{"text":"Connecting through sky harbor after 5 hour flight on my way to Kauai (#humblebrag).  This place was on the other side of the terminal, but worth the walk.  Espresso and coffee was the jolt I needed. Mahalo!"}
{"text":"This really is about as good as it gets.  The coffee is really delicious, the people who work there are personable and make you feel at home, never snooty about anything and the decor is really pleasant.

There's nothing to be said of this place that another yelper hasn't already said more intelligently except for this:  I leaned my bike up against a shelf, my tire slipped and bumped into said shelf, knocking an expensive, free-trade, no-war-orphans-were-maimed-or-blood-spilled to deliver you this glass type thing and it shattered on the ground. 

I hate being a clumsy shithead, man.  Anyway, they were cool about it... not just cool about it, they made me feel not-embarrassed.  I paid for the cup I broke and they gave me my coffee for free.  

That's service.  Who does that?  If someone came into my coffee shop and broke shit I'd tell 'em to get out.

Also, I like that they don't play the music there too loud.  Sometimes coffee shops have their goddamn hippie shit blaring at full volume.  Here, you can comfortably sip your coffee and nurse a hangover.

The only thing that would make this place better is if they had a kitchen and served amazing breakfast."}
{"text":"When I travel, there are two things I must find in every city: the used bookstores and proper coffee. Cartel satisfied the latter. Great space, great staff, great coffee. I had an Americano and my girlfriend a cappuccino, and both were perfect. Definitely my go-to if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere open contemporary minimalist. They have excellent coffees to choose from for those who drink it black and enjoy noticing various flavor notes. The staff was kind and attentive. They do get busy so be thoughtful during your visit and maintain the kindness."}
{"text":"I was told by a AZ local (I'm from CA)  that this was the best coffee place in Tempe and boy she knows her coffee! My cold brew was smooth, and gave me the kick I needed after a big dinner. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite coffee shops when I visit Phx/Tempe. Their roast is not burnt like so many other places and the atmosphere is cool. It's a great place to work or to meet up with other people. The vibe is great!"}
{"text":"They suck at expresso!
What the fuck does symbols syrup belong in expresso?

I asked for expresso and the rude person tells me we have simple syrup for you!

Bitch I want an expresso with sugar!

I didn't bother drinking it!

12:40pm @ Gate c12 in Phoenix Airport!

They suck @ coffee!"}
{"text":"Coffee is strong yet pure coffee joint. They make individual espresso by coffee press ( so like a lab )  Their employees Kaylie and Mark are awesome staff members. Excellent service by them. I liked their service. 4 star for service and coffee . Loved the service. Very busy."}
{"text":"A great place to meet with friends and have some coffee or beer. My major complaint is the that there are so many people with lap tops that are kind of hogging the seats. Which makes it awkward to ask them to move so your party can sit next to each other."}
{"text":"The hype is justified. This. Is. Coffee."}
{"text":"Best coffee I've had in Phoenix.
The pour over and chemex are well worth it."}
{"text":"I love the coffee here. Heads up Mocha-frappa-latte-cino drinkers, this is a Coffee Bar, not a cafe. Don't come expecting to get your double whip triple shot low fat salted caramel gargle blaster here. 

The service was friendly, the air conditioning was just-right, there's plenty of 20amp power jacks, and the wifi works as promised. 

My only complaint is that the furniture is very noisy on the concrete flooring. I had to move a coffee table and it sounded like nails on a chalkboard. 

Seriously, get some soft feet on those metal table legs!!!"}
{"text":"Was waiting for companions to finish shopping and stopped in. Nothing fancy but the place is definately interesting. The atmosphere is a bit dark lots of people on laptops and the coffee is pretty decent."}
{"text":"If you appreciate quality espresso and coffee then this is a must. Best coffee in Scottsdale, and they have a location in the C Terminal at the Phoenix airport. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"When visiting Scottsdale from snowy Chicago, I had iced coffee on the mind. Not just any regular iced coffee, but deep, dark, delicious cold brew. A quick search on Yelp and I found Cartel downtown. The menu is simple, and there are two sizes of cold brew. I ordered up a large for $3, and it was exactly what I was craving. It was so good, I made a return trip the next day to repeat it."}
{"text":"Chai taste bad.. Like sugar water . So be careful if you are planing to order one. 
Service so slow. There were 2 people already ordered and waiting for order. But it took almost 10 min to receive my order. 
I didn't get a chance to taste rest food.

FYI: they have 2 size small/large. 
Small is 8 oz and large is ~16oz  in quantity. 
It is little pricey quantity vs price. But I believe because of airport charges."}
{"text":"I studied here for a couple of months for my Private Pilot's License. I work here about once or twice a month since they have a nice atmosphere and good wifi connection. Their green tea is always on point and enhances my mood every time I drink it. Highly suggested for a meeting place, interview, laptop, work and good caffeinated drinks."}
{"text":"My experience w/the barista was that he was not very friendly. Took almost 40 min to get two coffee orders. This was my third time here & I would say all three times I've had a similar experience."}
{"text":"Bought a soy latte because I felt bad for needing to use the bathroom. Really liked the roast, actually. Was thrown off by the lack of a macchiato, however. But now that I've stopped by, I'll probably end up in here when I'm at Buffalo. Good job!"}
{"text":"This was the best double espresso con macchiato I have ever had!
However, when I asked for a to go cup I was flatly told no, that it would ruin the presentation. Really?
\"Art\" at the expense of customer service is not endearing in food service.
Loved the rest of the place, decor was great, atmosphere hip......Coffee Awesome."}
{"text":"5 stars for friendly people, and 5 stars for good coffee.. but 1 star on the amount of ice Cartel puts in their drinks.. I paid $8.00 for 2 small drinks (1 mocha, and 1 chai) which were more than half way filled up with ice. Took me 1 min after walking out the door to finish my delicious chai.. what a disappointment.. just which that I could have had more."}
{"text":"i HAD to write an incredible review for this coffee.  I LOVE coffee and have tried it many places...switzerland, seattle (original starbucks), canada, and even ordered from other countries to make my own at home...and this was the absolute best coffee that rivals the latte i had in Italy!!!!  I ordered a skim latte w sugar free vanilla (my standard) and it was an enjoyable friendly staff but when I tasted it I was in heaven.  THanks Cartel....cant wait to visit Phoenix again soon (live in Chicago)"}
{"text":"I love Cartel coffee and the fact that they have an airport location is fantastic for those early morning flights. The best thing about this location is that even being a high traffic airport location they still put the same care and quality into every order just like at the standalone locations. 

The staff is always friendly and helpful especially when trying to decide which drink to go with. The real impressive thing for this staff is that they can turn out the drinks quickly and with quality even when there is a line. Speaking of the line it's usually less than sub-par overpriced chain location just down the terminal. 

If you need a wake up while at the airport be sure to come over to this location by gate C14. It's worth the walk if you are in the C gate area (or are on a long wait in the other gates)."}
{"text":"Coffee is pretty good. The hipsters are insufferable."}
{"text":"6 dollars for a large dirty chai which was 1/3 ice. Have these people lost their minds?

Good coffee but way too overpriced."}
{"text":"Excellent traditional macchiatos - as smooth as it gets whether its at Sky Harbor, downtown Phoenix or Old Scottsdale - all locations are consistently wonderful.  Also, love the fact that if you request \"for here\" they do not give you a paper cup and give you a proper macchiato cup and saucer.  Paper (cups) and espresso do not go well together..."}
{"text":"Chatted up co-owner Amy a recent weekend morning and she was just a genuine lovely friendly person. Told me how her husband's love of coffee brought him to Guatemala (where they purchase their beans), converted her a little over a year ago to the addictive brew, and led them to open up Cartel mid-January of this year. Despite having been a convert to the whole coffee thing, Amy made me a very smooth, very effective $2 Americano - served up in an eco-conscious 100% corn takeaway cup.

They roast their beans on premises and have places to lounge and meander within their space. It is very spacey, somewhat warehousey - which isn't exactly my groove but nevertheless, I will be back with more friends and time to spare in the near future. Quality and good prices are at the forefront of this operation."}
{"text":"Look - 3 stars is A-OK. And that's how their coffee tasted - A-OK. Hard time to rate them though - New Year's Day, leaving town, they didn't get their pastry shipment, so there was very little to choose from and very little atmosphere cuz no one was up yet. But the bottom line is that the cappuccino didn't blow me away - it was fine.

I'd give it another shot next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The reasons I docked a star is because there's just no sign out there telling me where it is. I walked past it a few times just trying to find the place. Not fun, need better signage - heck even a postal delivery lady couldn't find the place in the first go! 

The place was nice, ample seating. My coffee was prepared there and then and the gentleman that helped me was very friendly and helpful in helping me get my drink since I wasn't quiet sure what I wanted! He also mentioned they give a discount for drip coffee if you being in your own cup. 

The food selection wasn't extensive but the scone was really nice - heck I'd go back for more ! 

The place was not pretentious, had a local artist displaying her work, the place was neat and clean. I went in probably at an odd time and so the place was empty. I would really like to see some professional signs inside as well - not sharpie scribbled pieces of cardboard :) 

Overall I liked it, fix that display signs now please !"}
{"text":"I was only in Tempe for a few days, and we wanted to try different places for coffee, but we ended up coming here twice. It's a little off the beaten path, but once you're inside you'll see why they have such rave reviews. The decor is funky and modern; there's one partition made of bicycle tires! There's a couch, counters, and plenty of tables and chairs in the front and back. People come here to work, but we also saw people chatting over chess, and just hanging out. Bonus points for being dog-friendly! Now about that coffee: I got the cold brew on tap both times, and it was amazing. Having the brew on tap means less watery coffee and more caffeine! Amazing, bodied flavor without being bitter or too strong. I didn't try anything else, but their pastries and espresso shots looked awesome too."}
{"text":"Great imports of coffee, freshly roasted. Very alternative but lively atmosphere. A bit on the pricy side but can't really complain."}
{"text":"coffee wasn't the best. asked for a \"HOT\" mocha and got lukewarm trash. not a good experience not going again."}
{"text":"Excellent little 3rd wave coffee shop in Scottsdale. They serve AeroPress here. Try it! Also, the prickly pear iced tea is excellent."}
{"text":"Good unique sandwhiches, so-so coffee, and trendy people"}
{"text":"Coffee is amazing as always, but only 1 person was there working at 7:30am on a Sunday morning... my order (5 drinks) took approximately 30 minutes. I just wish that the barista would have let me know rather than take payment and then have me wait while he made them intermixed with taking new orders and making other customer drinks.."}
{"text":"Nice little place with a perfect setup for all the Apple lovers out there. Coffee really nice but I think one should try the different blends of regular coffee and not the espresso as this is not the niche for Cartel. Nice place and worth a short stop when in the area"}
{"text":"As I was told, the only independent privately owned coffee shop in any airport in the country. Cool!

Legit coffee from people that care. I got a cup using the V60. I don't know a whole lot about the alternate brewing methods. It took about 5 minutes, so it's not for you if you have to catch a flight right away. The coffee did have a wide range of flavor notes, like fruitiness, wood, sweetness, and earthiness. It was good- not amazing, but I can definitely appreciate the craft in the brewing method. 

Thanks Cartel!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how anyone likes the coffee here. They claim to be the best. I found the coffee luke warm and weak. Now, it was so weak, that I had them put a shot of espresso in it. Nothing could bring this coffee back to life. 

I am into coffee...big time. I have been drinking coffee from all over the USA since the 1970s. It has to be bold and fresh. I've been here a few times. I like the atmosphere, though it's mostly students hanging out. Still, it's pretty funky, and I wanted to love it here. the servers were nice enough. It's just that the coffee was TERRIBLE. Please, whoever owns this place, train your staff to make consistent coffee that is bold. From the three times I've been here, in different months, all three cups of your boldest coffee tasted WEAK! I don't know how to express this more. I will check you guys out again and see if there is improvement, but quite frankly, I don't see that happening. This is sad to me, because I want to love it here."}
{"text":"most hipster coffee spot in phoenix--not a bad thing!  the staff were very friendly/laid back. cool atmosphere.  i ordered a latte and a chocolate cookie.  the cookie was ok..i guess i was looking for something really decadent and i didn't really get that--it had more of like a protein bar taste to it; wasn't bad, wasn't good.  the latte was awesome though.  you could really taste the espresso. if you're looking for a latte that is essentially milk and sugar, you may want to look somewhere else. or ask for it sweetened."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find this place is!!!  I am very spoiled with the coffee places near me, but I was travelling in AZ, and I refuse to go to $tarbuck$.......... I really don't like their coffee or their way of taking over the world of coffee. Anyway, i had an iced cold brew, as it was 90*+ outside, and I just wanted to relax. The music was great, and the atmosphere very calming.  Thank you Cartel for making a great cup of coffee........"}
{"text":"The granola with fruit was amazing looking! Got a muffin as well as a caffe late with agave. It was such a delicious cup of coffee. Really like the atmosphere of cartel and their selection of breakfast food as well as coffee. Great location right next to the Phoenix convention center."}
{"text":"Pretty cool decoration with the wheel and the chair - HIDDEN GEM

Ever since http://www.yelp.com/biz/portola-coffee-lab-costa-mesa

The boyfriend and I wanted to see if there's more of these kind of coffee lab. Yay! Found one in Arizona! Glad we found one near where he lives, because I didn't want to drive any further than 20 mins plus to get some good coffee. 

Came here in the afternoon on a Saturday, and man were there a lot of people just studying. 

Drinks
+Iced Toddy ($3.95) - The boyfriend got this and holy cow was it strong. A very concentrated coffee. It's like drinking a americano at Starbucks but without mixing it with water. But of course this place was a bit better because it's different 

+ Iced Chai with Soy milk ($4.85) - Yums! You can adjust the sweetness of it, but I forgot to do so so it was a bit too sweet for me.

Decoration

Feels like you're sitting in a warehouse. Bike wheels are attached with each other like a barrier/wall between two sides. Haha.. I laughed when I saw the hair salon chair. Pretty cool. 

Chilled place to hang out and to study. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Everything you want in a coffee shop 

Once in a while I  just have to give in to my \"Cartel Coffee Lab\" cravings and get my fix.  Today, I visited Cartel Coffee with a co-worker who is a \"regular\".

The atmosphere at Cartel Coffee Lab is warm, inviting, and relaxed. Cartel Coffee Lab is very popular with a varied  cross section of the community. On any given day you can see young professionals, students, families, and retirees sitting around using  lap tops, chatting, and enjoying their beverage of choice 

The baristas at Cartel Coffee Lab clearly know their stuff.  These folks are encyclopedias of everything coffee related. I can't think of a better way to start my day then with the perfect Americano and a pop de tarte.  
  
Cartel Coffee is a great shop with lots of local color but, don't visit if you're in a hurry, once you take a seat, you won't want to leave."}
{"text":"Out of all the CCL locations this is my favorite location. It's in the heart of 5th Ave shopping plaza and a stone throws away from Scottsdale Fashion and Old Town. 

They serve alcohol (beer & wine) at this location. 

They have two bathrooms outside in the corridor and they have quiet rooms in the back if you really need to get work done."}
{"text":"It's close to Arizona State University (ASU) so you're going to see a lot of students here. If you like to chat and catch up with friends or colleagues, this is conveniently next to downtown Mill Avenue (it's a short walk to Mill Ave). It's usually crowded because their coffee and loose leaf tea are super popular with the locals. They also have delicious cookies and pastries for sell if you're hungry.

It can get a bit loud here so if you need to go somewhere to study or read a book I'd advise you to go somewhere else.

Parking is a nightmare. I would highly recommend biking or walking."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend a few months ago when I was in Arizona for a conference.

Was probably not the location I should have met him at. Why? Well, I was very definitely the oldest person in the place. He's more than 15 years my junior and was probably the second oldest. 

Coffee was very well done. If I lived in Arizona, I'd find and check out heir other locations.
Service was better than average but not superb.
Noise level was off the wall. We could barely hear each other."}
{"text":"Cartel has been one of my favorite places to get a coffee and to work from. I like that they are constantly trying out new drinks and food items. Also, their affogato might be the best in town."}
{"text":"Got to say caffeine drinks and alcohol is how I make it thru my day. To find a place that has both and happy hour too, I'm in! This one has whisky and a GREAT selection of IPAs. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here after using my Yelpy app to help me find a place for coffee and breakfast that wasn't the Starbucks in the PCC. Finding places like these are why I love Yelp. That said, I was a little lost since they had just moved and Google maps wasn't updated yet, so I was happy that I had decided to just keep walking in a straight line until I found something. 

And oh, I found something. The best breakfast burrito I've EVER had in my life. I don't remember what it was called, and it is not on their website, but it was full of eggs and vegetables and came with some hot sauce. The staff were very friendly and helpful since it was clear I had just stumbled into their shop. I was surprised when I tried to order a white mocha and their flavoring options were very limited, but the large vanilla late was not only pretty and made very deliberately to taste the way it did, it was quite tasty. It may have been shockingly bitter if you are used to ordering drinks with sugar syrups, but I had recently changed up my routine at my local coffee shop in Tucson to use sugar free white mocha so it was nice to mostly taste the coffee flavor in all its glory.

They were also apologetic that their square app was running slow since they were still getting their Wi-fi moved from their other location, and there were a few men deciding how to hang a fairly large red chandelier, although I thought it looked like cool art right where it was on the floor. 

I was so happy with my find that I came back on day two of my conference and ordered the same coffee and a bacon and egg breakfast sandwich. Not only was it delicious with some tasty sauces, it was HUGE. Even though I tried my best, I couldn't eat the whole thing."}
{"text":"I go out of my way to come to this Cartel any time I'm at the airport - even if it means going down 2 extra moving walk-ways. 
The line here is usually somewhat long (I suppose it depends on what time you are here) but the workers move people through pretty quickly.
I'm typically just a black coffee type person, but I've had their Lattes and Americanos here before as well. I like that their coffee is all locally roasted and very high quality. 
The only problem I had was last time I came in, the drip coffee tasted a bit burnt. This definitely won't keep me from coming back, but I may just get something different next time."}
{"text":"Great coffee !! I love the vanilla lattes and the dirty chai teas are bomb, My Sis & I love coffee and this coffee spot has to be in my top ten faves :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Cartel location.  Since the renovation, it's really beautiful, but even before, it had a pretty hip, if slightly divey, vibe. 

The menu is super simple, no frills, but what you get is always good.  My husband, friends and I have spent many pleasant hours here, enjoying the lovely cocoa and tea, coffee, baked snacks, and atmosphere.  The service isn't super quick when they're busy, but that's because, although the menu is basic, every beverage is made with care (and you can taste that). 

They have tons of seating for laptop or school work (or board games - we brought our own) or relaxing. so you can come and stay a while..

The people-watching is pretty excellent (hipster haven) and the art is exceptional.  I purchased an incredible painting by Jason Rudolph Pena for a friend, and it gets tons of compliments.  My husband also bought a tee-shirt here a while back, and still wears it often (Cartel, if you're listening, people tell us all the time that they want to buy one, so bring it back if you haven't already!)"}
{"text":"Great tea (hot/iced), great hot cocoa, and my friends tell me the coffee is tasty, too.  It has that great Cartel vibe - modern, funky, artsy, classy - and friendly staff.  Lots of seating (mostly tables and chairs, but some backless couches line the sides), plus a cozy, dog-friendly side patio.

The drink menu is simple - lots of coffees but not a huge selection of weird ways to have them (no almond milk, but they do have soy).  A few teas, hot cocoa (yay!), and they are now serving beer as well (pretty tasty stuff).

It's been quiet on my visits, which is lovely for reading, and the music is soft but awesome.

I haven't tried the food beyond the cookies (which are decent in a pinch but too dry to be scrumptious to this dessert snob)."}
{"text":"Its taste does not match its price. I feel my money wasted. I should have waited in the long line at Starbucks..."}
{"text":"Odd, funky, industrial but clean and fancy enough for suits and lawyers. Delicious espresso. Has tea, beer, great location, grunge music and a \"What's up dude\" greeting. Keep me on my toes. Prices in line with other shops despite high dolla location."}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite location for Cartel, though I do love their other locations.  As an avid coffee drinker, I find that Cartel is possibly the best roaster in Phoenix. Living in the North West for a while and coming back to AZ I found it hard to find truly great espresso for quite some time. If you're a fan of quality roasted coffee and great espresso based drinks/pourovers...I definitely recommend checking out Cartel. The only thing I do wish about this location had is longer hours, like their Tempe location.

I still haven't tried their beers yet, but I'll definitely be updating my review once I get the chance. Also I'm not sure why people are bashing their interior, it fits Arizona very nicely."}
{"text":"Just visiting the area and have only been here once. Got a cold brew which was a little sour for me, had to add sweetener and milk. Tried my sister's iced chai which was good, quite sweet but not spicy enough for me. I liked the vibes if this place, definitely hipstery, the baristas especially. Came on a Saturday and it was packed with people doing work individually or in pairs. Good place for doing work if you're ok with working to music. When I was there it was like the Miley Cyrus soundtrack or something because that's all that was playing. Free wifi and lots of outlets. Tip: you can also get the oolong tea iced but it just takes a while. Overall a cool place but not wowing, would have to come back to give it another try."}
{"text":"Left positive reviews for this Cartel before and been here many times at the airport.  Today was disappointing.  Usually the people are friendly and attentive but not today.  The girl taking my order looked at me as if I was inconveniencing her.  I ordered a hot Americano but it was barely warm.  Last I checked, hot means hot because it's a hot drink, you want it to stay good and warm for a while bla bla bla.  To me that shows a lack of interest or caring and I always thought this place and Chelsea's Kitchen were the only two places worth a shit at the airport.  Trained employees, friendly and quality food/drink.  Cartel was NOT that today and won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Some of the absolute greatest coffee I've ever had. I don't think the review has to say much else. 

If you want a good cup of coffee and you want quality beans, go to Cartel."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a  good strong cup of coffee - we had a cafe au lait and a cortado with half and half. Super location and nice relaxing vibe - great area and nice small shops/galleries. They have lots of different seating areas inside and outside - loved the decor!"}
{"text":"Great place! I went here for the first time today. Very cool urban environment and very roomy. The staff wasn't mean but weren't too friendly either. Also was pretty loud music so sometimes I couldn't hear my friend talking!"}
{"text":"To be honest, really incredible cappuccinos and flavorful home made pop-tarts. Most coffee places near college campuses are cheap (both taste & price), but this blew me away. Really cool \"chill\" atmosphere and great place for college students to hang, socialize or even focus on work. Also great place to sit with your significant other, hang and just pass some time (like I did). Would go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Simple and awesome coffee. I got the cold brew. It was my first time here and I basically told the girl at the register and she walked me through my purchase. I knew I wanted some cold brew and she kindly told
Me the different notes in the selection they had that morning. 10/10 would come again. I love the venue too it's really nice and lots of lounge area."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for local coffee shops when I'm traveling, so it was nice to stumble (er yelp) upon Cartel when I was in Scottsdale a couple weeks ago. 

I needed a coffee shop to work out of and ended up staying all day. Good wifi, great coffee, surprisingly delicious lunch, and crazy friendly staff. Definitely better than spending my day working out of Starbucks."}
{"text":"Stop the chitter chatter and make my coffee!  The plane is about to take off!  no coffee for me. I had to leave it and board."}
{"text":"Damn nice. I like that if you order a cup of coffee they make it fresh.  I like the style of the place.  I like that the free internet works.  Basically I just like this place."}
{"text":"love how they give you real green tea and roast the beans on site.  cool music and internet always works."}
{"text":"Checked out their Tempe location, I haven't been down there in years. It was great to see they were busy and it of course had a nice college coffee vibe.

 My Iced Vanilla latte was pretty good, not too sweet and just how I like it. The guy at the counter was friendly and the barista was fast with my order :) 

I ended up buying a pound (which is really less than a pound) of coffee beans. I asked a few questions about the beans vs all others... He was knowledgable which was awesome. On the down side my beans were $21!!!!!!!! Way not cool. My personal opinion is they should never be over 15. I bought them anyway thinking let's give the golden beans a try... After a few makes at home...Again, no way $21 worth."}
{"text":"Beans are roasted inside. Best dirty chai latte iced or hot. Love the design of this place. Great to just come and hang out. College kids here doing homework. Very hip."}
{"text":"One of my favorite downtown stops, offering a tempting item at every daypart. From the breakfast burrito to the beet salad with goat cheese and pastry happy hour, this place has a little bit of everything (including bacon accents in baked goods). Staff is always friendly and inviting. Would highly recommend you scope it out."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pour over coffee I've had to date. I just returned from Costa Rica and the coffee was good, but I also learned on a coffee tour the best coffee is exported. Leaving a great sub par coffee for domestic consumption. The flavor profile of the coffee cartel is so complex. Subtle undertones of honey or vanilla, orange effervescence( depending on what they have and what you choose). James is my go to hit here. Super cool, chill and knowledgable. He remembers your name too. Please drink it black, adding anything will ruin the brew in my opinion.  They have an amazing cold brew as well and fresh top notch pastries. Try the pop tart. If you're a local or a tourist stop by cartel, grab a pour over coffee, a pop tart and take 30 min to appreciate life how good it truly is. When you're recharged go try and spread the good vibes by helping another!"}
{"text":"Il caffe' e' uno dei migliori che ho assaggiato negli stati uniti...their espresso is one of the best I have tried in the States !"}
{"text":"This place just made my top 3 for Iced Dirty Chai. Good way to start my rushing Mon morning. #Phoenix #dirtyChai"}
{"text":"The best tasting decaf coffee that I have ever had! We bought a bag to go home to NYC with! Worth the trip if you are local or if you are an out of towner like me, they have an online shop to purchase from."}
{"text":"Now that's a tasty latte!  I really liked the coffee joint that used to be in this space, but Cartel has taken serving awesome coffee to a whole 'nutha level by serving up fresh, delicious food, beer and wine!  Since my man doesn't like coffee, I have to have something like beer to lure him into a coffee shop.  Thank you Cartel for keeping relationships together!!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Scottsdale. A definite Starbucks alternative. Easy access to old town. Grab a coffee and walk around the art studios. The caffeine push will make you buy a new piece of artwork or possibly just pose for a selfie."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Excellent drinks. Lots of seating available. 

I got the One on One espresso shots. I highly recommend it if you're an espresso lover. I didn't know hot to drink it at first so I'll share it here lol Drink the dark espresso shot first, then drink the soda to rinse your palate, and sip the creamy espresso to finish off. 

Their cold brew is also very good. You can smell the fresh coffee beans being roasted throughout the coffee lab here, which is an awesome experience. I haven't tried any of their beer yet but am looking forward to trying it!

This place is great for studying and just chilling with good company."}
{"text":"Went back to this location on my way out of town this past week. They have stepped it up!"}
{"text":"Same stuff different day at Cartel. Girl at the register told me she didn't know what a cortado was to get me to explain it to her. I have ordered them here for YEARS. Really?!"}
{"text":"Wow. I wish all the Cartels locations were like this. Professional, articulate and MATURE staff at this location. Great coffee, great recommendations on wines. What a relief.

Upper management take note: whoever is running this location, let them take the reins. This place runs circles around the Tempe and airport stores."}
{"text":"The best. 

Best coffee in Scottsdale hands down. Very similar to Portola in OC.

Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I'm a serial coffee shop lover but a furious hater of coffee! That being said, I just like to order tea. Usually, tea is more or less just tea and nothing special everywhere I go. The barista was very sweet and gave me lots of options I'm not used to like a pump of vanilla or sweetener in my tea. This was awesome! Usually you order a tea and they just pour it in the cup and send you on your way. I have rarely had a coffee place care about how I like my tea! I definitely recommend a bit of vanilla in your black tea. I had a delish chocolate chip cookie too. I had a big meeting right across the street after I came in here, and a happy face and a nice cold tea was exactly what I needed to get in the right mindset. Thanks Cartel! Can't wait to go back to have a snack and hang out."}
{"text":"I like the coffee here.  Its been good every time I go.  Sometimes the music is a little loud and I think thats a bit much - but maybe I am just getting old.

I don't know.  I actually like to have a conversation with the person I am there with.  Call me old fashioned, but the music doesn't need to send my drink flying off the table like I am in an 80's Maxell commercial."}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee Lab has the three C's...coffee, cocktails (well beer but that doesn't start with a c) and cuisine. So with the three C's, I say, welcome to Scottsdale Cartel! 

Although I frequented this location's former coffee shop many times during its existence, I had yet to visit the new Cartel Coffee Lab when it opened...until today. I realize what I've been missing and I won't make that mistake again. The location was cool before, but now with the Cartel touch, it's even cooler. The coffee is the delicious Cartel coffee blend and the vibe is eclectic and coffee shop'esque. But here's a nice twist courtesy of Cartel's elves. Besides basic baked goods, they also serve a simple breakfast and lunch menu. 

The breakfast menu includes items such as breakfast sandwiches and oatmeal. The lunch menu includes items such as a turkey sandwich with a delicious pesto sauce, a ham sandwich and salads like tuna salad. It's a small menu but it's good. Plus you get chips, a salad or fruit with your lunch sandwich. Add a non-fat vanilla latte and you've got yourself a delicious lunch, or at least I did! 

Seating is slightly limited but you should be able to find a seat on a basic work day. Plus, the vibe is comfortable and perfect to sit and work (as long as you're ok with community tables)."}
{"text":"It's worth the walk to another area in Terminal 4 to score some delicious and local Cartel Coffee. Travelers are truly spoiled now that Cartel has opened a store inside the airport. This coffee is a gem in Phoenix and I always love to both drink and buy Cartel coffee. Not only is the coffee delicious, but the packets of coffee beans make a perfect gift for the coffee lover in your life. During a recent early morning trip, I left my area of the airport and took a little walk to score a Cartel mocha with non-fat milk. It kept me awake and going for the rest of the very long day and for that I am eternally grateful to this locally shop. Now my advice to every traveler is to do your taste buds a favor and purchase a cup o' Joe from Cartel.

PS - they have locations in the Valley, including one I frequent in Old Town Scottsdale so if you're an out-of-towner make sure you ask about their locations!"}
{"text":"Great place to study or work if you don't mind the music.  I love their music selection.  The plain coffee is really amazing, and they roast their own beans.  Only downside = VERY expensive.  $2.50 for a small coffee and refills cost the same as the first cup!"}
{"text":"As a recent addition to the Portland area, its difficult for me to find fault with any of the coffee shops here. Cartel, however, tops every cafe I've seen so far. 

Their pastries are delicious (try the bacon/choco chip cookie or the blueberry white chocolate scone). Their coffee is excellent and served in recycled/biodegradable cups, but dont ask for your cappucino to go- its expressly forbidden (says the sign behind the counter; \"Complain all you want, but that cappucino is for here). 

The menu is simple but covers the gambit. You can chose anything from a toddy (good choice) to one of many teas to their tasty chai (excellent at Christmastime). 

Cartel also happens to boast some of the nicest and most knowledgable baristas I have encountered in ages (a lot to say considering the sheer amount of cafes here in the Pacific North West). Jeff makes the best Iced Mocha. Ashley makes excellent foam designs. Devon always has an awesome attitude- humor infused with sarcasm, but only in the best way. Athena is sweet and always helpful. Paul can always be seen tending to the day's roast. I could go on about every employee, but to make a long story slightly shorter, all of the employees are friendly, more than competent, and are very good at making you feel comfortable and welcome. 

The decor is visually interesting (see; hanging area divider made entirely of metal bike wheel frames. See also; constantly changing featured artists work for sale, warehouse-esque basic interior, bathroom covered in awesome tags and paintings) but is never overkill or distracting. 

The Tempe location is tucked away in University Square. The place is easy to miss- with only one small sign that says 'Cartel Coffee Lab' hanging out front and a classic red and blue 'Open' sign, it' is unostentatious and slightly off the beaten path. 
The plaza is, however, the heart and soul of Tempe- at least to many of the locals. Right behind to the Headquarters Smokeshop (in business for a quarter of a century), Cowtown Skateboards (ling time locals), El Pollo Supremo (arguably the best Mexican food in the area), Buffalo Exchange (an Arizona based company whose first shops opened in Tucson), near Tempe Farmer's Market, Casey Moore's (unarguably the most popular bar in the area), HTC Piercing (affiliated with High Priestess of Oregon), and Wet Paint Artist Supply (ran by the ever-winderful Jess. Ask her to tell you about mooeds sometime), the location is near ASU, Mill Avenue, and historic Tempe and is prime.

Tempe Cartel will soon boast a bar around the west side of the space which one can only assume will be as successful as the ever-full cafe. Mixed drink aficionados need not apply, though. Straight from the horse's mouth, there will be no hard liquor served here. However, patrons can expect to enjoy the ample comforts of a micro-brewery and wine bar. 

Five out of five stars."}
{"text":"I went to this cafe within the last year and they had a great little breakfast. Just visited again and they ousted the breakfast that I was looking forward to. Such a shame. Coffee is okay, overpriced and not a whole lot of options."}
{"text":"The coffee was alright. It wasn't anything special. I think what you're really paying for is the \"hip\" atmosphere. There were four people in line ahead of me who each either ordered one or two drinks a piece. I ended up waiting over 20 minutes to get my coffee. The place is okay but nothing special. I would also probably rate this $$."}
{"text":"Worth the trip from the other side of the terminal!! GF muffins are awesome, as is the coffee, of course."}
{"text":"Oh, the coffee is just as delicious as always.

But I really don't like the way the quality of service has dipped down here ever since the owners aren't around that much anymore. 

Being ignored while figuring out the tip jar, having judgments made about wanting soy creamer in my coffee, being ignored while baristas are between shifts while there are FOUR baristas sitting at the counter watching a line of 10 people form, light bulbs not getting replaced in lamps for months, having other customers made fun of once they are out of earshot, etc. 

Oh, and my partner doesn't drink coffee or tea. They asked him what he drank, and he said once in a while he likes Italian soda and was told \"Oh you like the high fructose syrup huh?\" Excuse me? We just bought 3 drinks from you, tipped you, and you have the audacity to make judgments about someone you have no clue about (that man reads more ingredient labels than the Whole Foods CEO)?!? 

I feel terrible having to write this, but several of my friends have noted the service here has been rude, dismissive (I would be exaggerating if I stated that was every experience-I have had nice exchanges, but when I start to dread going into a place b/c of an attitude, that is bad). I even had a barista tell me I should thank the other barista for getting my soy latte right-um, yes I appreciate the effort...that is why I paid you 4 bucks, not including tip. 

Regarding slow service, I have been told there will now be bar backs to help out with orders to help pare down the line, which is a great idea.

They stopped doing decaf coffee drinks, leaving me with either the jitters for 2 days if I really want a latte or having to get the Decaf clover (which is delish but not really that special from my own french press), so that is a major bummer for people with high sensitivity to caffeine such as myself.

BUT- I will say their superior product, the care the baristas put into their product, their location are all factors that still get some stars from me and I am willing to come in here again in the future, I just really need a break from tipping a staff that is so uneven. 

Looks like its me going to Lux for a while!"}
{"text":"We are visiting and needed a good smooth coffee and this place was perfect. The coffee was amazing and atmosphere was great. We got the vanilla latte and it was perfect. Not too sweet and and espresso was delicious. Was pretty busy but they got our order out very fast. Highly recommend this place and it takes a lot for me to say that because I am kind of a \"coffee snob\""}
{"text":"$4 for an 8 ounce cup of coffee?? I think not... I can go to coffee bean and get a bigger size for the same price. Their food was pricey too, so no thank you. The vanilla latte I ordered did not taste like it had any vanilla in it. I give them another star for the decor and artsy feel of it, and the cute guys that were working in there when I came in, but that's it. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Stormed through the terminal to arrive just as they were closing. The poor soul at the counter had to suffer through our deliberations of what to get, but was an absolute sweetheart about it. Since we had a late night flight, we weren't really up for coffee - he recommended the Chai Latte, which was flavorful and spiced just right. Such a delight!"}
{"text":"I'm not a coffee drinker, but I recognize a great coffee shop when I see one.  The employees were all very active while I was here.  Non-stop taking orders and making espresso drinks.  My chai was prepared while I was finishing up paying.  The espresso drink was ready in less than 5 minutes at the end of the bar.  There was someone roasting beans while we were here one day.  The next day we came back (because it was so good) and there was another employee giving an interview (not sure if for a TV show or for a commercial).  There is not a shortage of places to sit, so bring your laptop or book and get cozy!  Lots of outlets, too.

I am in constant search for the best iced chai.  This is it.  I found it.  Great price for the size (much better than Starbucks).  They even bottle the chai syrup for you to buy (too big for my airplane carry on or else I would have bought to bring back to St. Louis).

There serve beer,  too!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, take an extra 5mins and have a single aero pressed. Its worth the taste and interesting to watch them make your coffee. These guys can compete with roaster companies in the pacific northwest."}
{"text":"Hey Cartel, love the shop and come here way too often, But can you fix your power outlets? It seems an easy thing to do and would bring your customers a lot of pleasure. C'mon, they are so loose they don't even hold power plugs. The coffee is good and the workers are chill, but there are neglected little things that bring down the vibes.

PS: Can you bring your couches back instead of the wooden benches."}
{"text":"I drink coffee 4-5 times a day, but I'm no good at telling good coffee from bad. The coffee-philes I know say the coffee here is some of the best in town, but I've never been able to tell. I think my tongue is dead.

What I do know is that the place feels like it's trying too hard to be hipster, and the clientele is trying even harder. Still, not a problem if that doesn't bother you, and frankly, why should it? You're here to drink coffee, not swap kale recipes."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Their cold brew coffee was on point. I've only been here in the mornings and I really enjoy the ambiance. The staff is super friendly and they have lots of choices to get your day started off on the right foot."}
{"text":"This is a nice place that kind of pops out of nowhere in the midst of Old Town Shops. Its real cute inside and has kind of a \"im a million miles away from the world\" feel. They have good beer choices and a happy hour pricing, sounds nice, I will go back soon."}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but for me coffee tastes so much better when it's served by someone who knows far more about coffee than I do, and isn't afraid to say so. I have been searching for a coffee shop that is willing to show me how little I know about coffee and offer me a chance to learn the *correct* way to drink it, and boy did I find it. 

If I hadn't come here, I never would have learned that drinking a cappuccino in the car was just terribly gauche. I would have been ignorant of the fact that the *correct* temperature is precisely 20 degrees cooler than what the (ugh) general populace would prefer. If you want a hot, to-go cappuccino you might as well go to Starbucks with the rest of the mouth breathing, robusta-drinking, non-fair trading, multiple-sourcing, GMO-endorsing cretins. And I hope they scald your mmilk"}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends! Not a great place to do homework. Very loud but it's a fun atmosphere. Nice people that work there & great coffee. I will go back but I won't plan on doing a lot of school work there."}
{"text":"They told me they are the \"3rd Wave\" of coffee houses and I became a believer. I'm a sucker for the hipster, trendy sheet metal tables and industrial looking interior.  However what really matters here is the coffee.  Simply put it's the best I've had. I can't really even explain why, it just tasted smoother. I had multiple \"Dirty\" Chai Teas from them (Chai with an expresso shot added) and a couple of Americano's. All were made with care and attention to detail. I so wish this chain made it's way to Florida."}
{"text":"As a long time Starbucks drinker I can say I have absolutely had the best coffee drink I've ever drank and it came from Cartel. I'm a fan of both coffee and tea drinks. On this cold desert day I went to order a chai tea. The cashier asked me if it was \"dirty?\" I had no idea what that was but he told me it is a chai with an espresso shot added. It turned out to be the best decision I've ever made as I have now found my favorite coffee and tea drink of all time. Highly recommended.

Oh and they get 5 big stars for presentation."}
{"text":"This review is for their food selection only. As a paleo eaterairport sandwiches are everywhere but I wouldn't touch them with a 100 ft pole. Was so stoked to find fresh salads at Cartel, like their Eat the Rainbow option which was super fresh and included 4 dipping sauces to spice up the raw and blanched veggies. The chia pudding was a perfect finisher!"}
{"text":"Best coffee I've had in the Phoenix area. The first time we went, we had 2 cappuccinos (for here--they won't make them to go, understandably, as it ruins the foam). One of the owners made them for us, then told us the next time we came they were on him as they were rather wet. Certainly weren't the best-prepared cappuccinos, but at least he knows what a cappuccino is supposed to be. And any way, the coffee itself made up for the poor foam--just delicious. I wouldn't say that I'm a coffee expert by any means, but the flavor of the coffee just really stood out above any other I have had in a long time. That's probably because the owners get the beans from fair-trade farms in Guatemala (which they have visited), and then roast them themselves in the ware-housey shop. We later bought 2 bags of coffee to give as gifts, a dark Guatemala roast and the Black Market Espresso (tasted the first, which was good at home but not as good as when made at the Lab). You can also purchase cool coffee equipment in the front. The only downside would be a small amount of food available. I like to have something to eat with my morning coffee, and they have a few cookies (locally made and very tasty) and some other treats, but not much in the way of a breakfast. But in terms of coffee, this place is the top!"}
{"text":"Stellar espresso. Friendly roasters.
I moved to Phoenix just recently and have been looking for a quality local roaster and this place is legit.
I had a One & One and it came with an espresso shot, macchiato, and a seltzer to cleanse the palate. Terrific. It was really smooth and great with the cane sugar pump they had.
There were also roasting beans at the time and the roaster was really friendly and let us pick his brain on the process to our hearts content.
Just really pleased."}
{"text":"Cartel is really dependable for great coffee that hits the spot every time. I've gone to other coffee shops around the area but I always find myself coming back here. This is my go-to for soy lattes, but the mocha and chai latte are also amazing and the best I've had."}
{"text":"Having just recently relocated from Central Phoenix to Tempe I was super stoked to check out the coffee shops in the area anxious to find out where my new \"early morning salvation\" would come from and boy am I ever disappointed.  First, and this is not Cartel's fault-but where are the coffee shops in Tempe not on ASU campus?  I'm so disappointed by the lack of independent coffee shops but that's a yelp for another time.  Cartel, they seem to be good-good choices, and some of the staff really seem to know what's going on-my biggest complaint-service is so SLOW.  Seriously, maybe I'm just used to other coffee shops where they cater to the 9-5 crowd-but I don't have time to run in there before work because I've found I have to wait 10+ mins  for my Americano!  I would love to be able to frequent this place 3+ times a week but as little time as I allow myself in the morning before work I just can't do it....so I'm still lost and stuck with my own resources in looking for a great coffee shop...."}
{"text":"Cartel has great coffee, and I've enjoyed their shops in Tucson. The coffee was equally delicious here, but the wait staff was really just unfriendly. I'm not impressed by grumpy people."}
{"text":"Damn.... 
Another great coffee shop.

Really nice coffee in a small hip place.

They serve beer.

{"text":"High quality coffee and friendly/helpful/hipster staff, but soo overpriced. Barrier to entry is high, and for that reason, you lose a star. Sorry, Cartel, but be more affordable to the average folk."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops in Phoenix, but when the pricks behind the counter tell you they won't make you a doppio over ice, I want to punch them straight in the baby maker. When I'm paying don't tell me what I can and cannot have, I'm boycotting until they get over themselves."}
{"text":"Try the one & one: it should be on every espresso roaster's menu.

My favorite Phoenix coffee shop!

{"text":"I just realized I have never written a review of my beloved Cartel. 

I found Cartel Tempe before all of the expansions back in 2011 ish while I was a nursing student at ASU. This place became my second home. I spent most of my time here doing work. I loved the environment. I loved the people. I loved the coffee. This was my first experience with 3rd wave specialty coffee and it was an incredible eye-opener on how good coffee could really be. Eventually, I got a job at Cartel starting just as the airport location opened up. Then, I eventually moved on over to the Temple location. I had a couple shifts in Scottsdale also. I have visited downtown Phoenix often and even made the trip to Tucson's location. I can say the baristas at each of the shops maintain an incredible standard of professionalism and quality of coffee. It's impressive to find the same quality at all of the locations. I loved how much I learned about coffee. I loved learning the standards for a perfect cup of coffee and all of the different brewing methods and how making small adjustments to my grind or brewing method could bring out different aspects of the single origin bean. I loved steaming a velvety texture of milk to the perfect drinking temperature! I loved the latte art competitions. Every drink was always delicious no matter which barista made it! The cappuccino is a standard must-have. The toddy is chocolatey smooth. The gibraltar was my all time favorite with a 1:1 ratio of milk to espresso. I recommend trying one. Also, I recommend a chemex or V60 of any Ethiopian bean Cartel might have. always a favorite. They also make some pretty tasty cold brewed teas. Nowadays, I only drink herbal teas, so it is nice to still have a tasty option when I visit (they usually source something from Seven Cups tea or Maya tea company from what I remember). I just wish they would order some yerba mate!!!!

Anyway, I love this place. It's super hip. Super friendly and experienced baristas. They also brew beer if you are into that sort of thing."}
{"text":"\"I would like 3 espeesso shots poured over ice\"  manager \"we will have to add water to that\"  me \"i dont want water with it\" manager \"thats our corporate policy\" me \"goodbye\"

Seriously guys you are making coffee, not creating high art.  And you are located in an airport.  

I suggest that you listen to your customers and just taje their orders and money.  Its called business."}
{"text":"I tried to pry it out of them: What is the addictive chemical that Cartel puts in their coffee? Being a Denverite, I had to know: what can I do to get my fix while I'm not in Scottsdale?

Instead he gave me a list of his favorite coffee shops in Denver. Awesome service, amazing coffee and possibly an addictive chemical that creates the illusion of the best Iced Vanilla Latte you've ever had. 

This location serves local beer and wine as well. I'll try to make it back for happy hour."}

{"text":"Can't say enough good about Catel's coffee. Expertly roasted and perfectly prepared. The place is a bit packed, but that's to be expected with the flavors coming out of that roaster. So far the best coffee I have ever had in AZ! There's some pretty close but so far Cartel takes the cake."}
{"text":"I was paying by credit card and had the option of adding a tip and I'm thinking do I really be to tip somebody to make an El crappo airport latte? Wow was I wrong! I immediately noticed the beans were not over roasted. I then listened for the milk foaming, expecting to hear loud bubbling throughout as the \"barista\" butchers my drink. Alas, the initial fury was followed by quite as the milk was textured into a frothy sea of micro bubbles. A few taps on the counter to break up any large bubbles followed by a competition-worthy pour of latte art. Keep in mind that I gave no hint beforehand of being an espresso nut job whose espresso machine has computer controlled temp, oil damped pressure gauge, and silicone foam insulation wrapped around the boiler. Also all wires carefully routed so that if somebody was to disassemble it they would be stunned. You get the idea. I was, therefore, amazed that this was their std quality. This is what I call a \"twenty mile latte\" ie worth quite a drive. Also, the service was very friendly and attentive. This is almost worth booking a flight, going though a TSA pat down, and canceling the flight just to experience."}
{"text":"First impressions: Why am I in someone's garage?
Another psuedo-industrial \"underground\" decor coffee shop. Meh.
Is there some rule against having nice furnishings in order to be \"edgy\"?

Chairs and tables were functional but cheap. Molded plastic/fiberglass type chairs with metal legs, the kind of thing you'd expect in an \"institutional\" cafeteria from the 1970's.

Slooow! One person in line in front of me and it took nearly ten minutes to get my order taken. I'm more sympathetic to waits *after* my order has been taken, that way my bad hip and I don't have to stand in queue.

The drink came up quickly. They use the Monin brand chocolate syrup which (after trying at several different shops) I have decided is crap.

That said, the underlying coffee was smooth and very tasty! There was no metallic taste, which confirms my suspicion about the water at another shop that uses Cartel's roast.

Polite order taker and Very nice crema art by the barrista.

I'll have to try this location again for a drink without chocolate."}
{"text":"This place is gangster as it gets. Cartel coffee is the bomb at the airport. Not much seating but it's worth the wait if there's a line. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Holy cow...what a cool vibe.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee had saved me from mediocre coffee at the airport!  I was so excited to see they had cold brew on the menu, and it was filled with dark chocolate and cherry notes.  Yum!  This was my first time hearing about this coffee and now I'm a fan.  I\"m coming back to you when I come through Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Though my prior complaints about their hours still stand, I've been back enough times that I felt the need to elaborate on my previous review.

First, Cartel makes what is, in my opinion, the best cappuccino in Arizona.  It's simply perfect and they serve it in the traditional size and fashion.  If you are a member of the weight-loss crowd, this one is not for you since they don't offer sugar-free syrups or skim milk.  But believe me, this one is worth the calories.

Next, you will likely have to contend with the crowd.  During the school year, Cartel stays pretty full of hipsters toting their macbooks and self-aware ironic t-shirts.  Nonetheless, I advise you to wade through the horn-rimmed glasses and men in women's jeans, at least once, and try the best cappuccino in Tempe."}
{"text":"The coffee is really good. Super sweet staff. Most annoying vibe and music I've ever experienced. Having said that their coffee was good so I didn't want to be a total jerk. But for the love Of god play some decent music! SLAYER"}
{"text":"Total hipster poseterium but very friendly and the coffee is very good.

Always good service and a nice atmosphere.

A lot of very serious and very, very important WiFi laptopping going on. An accidental glimpse of the average Mac-Snob's MacBook Pro reveals Spotify, Facebook and Lainey Gossip. 

You will score extra hook-up points for an iPhone X and/or high-end MacBook Pro.

American flag baseball hats are discouraged. Def some good looking people come through here. Fun."}
{"text":"Good coffee, good service, love the location(although it can be hard to spot), and great patio. Pastries are tasty. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love! Coffee heaven! Multiple cold brews on tap and delicious baked treats. Our barista James was the best! Knowledgeable and great service. Thanks Cartel, great job!"}
{"text":"I think it's called a lab so that we know they take coffee seriously.  I almost never drink coffee black, but theirs was so flavorful with a hint of sweet spice, I went without my normal dousing of half/half.  Plus I ate an awful lot of cheese while I was in Arizona.

They brew a fantastic product, and serve it up in an environment that is edgy and artistic without being dirty, overbearing, or pretentious.  A terrific feat, that.

I feel compelled to mention that while my boyfriend's fancy Mac suffered serious sluggishness on their wireless signal, my cheap corporate Dell performed beautifully :P"}
{"text":"No nonsense coffee place with a simple chalk board with the types of coffee and the ways they will prepare it.  Not a huge selection of baked goods.  You get the sense that the proprieters are a little joyless and a little wary of corporate folks who want to grab a madeline with their $6.00 latte.  I like that angry streak.  their coffeee actually features in a drink that Nobuo's Teeter House offers on their menu which is coffee mixed with bourbon.  How genius is that.  They don't need to be nice, they just need to believe in their product.  And the product, is top notch."}
{"text":"I had a delicious cappuccino here.  It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was a lot better than Starbucks.  The service was slow but it was a busy Friday morning so maybe that's why."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of coffee, beer and pastires.  Great customer service with stellar decor."}
{"text":"I had an iced chai.  Gosh it was soo good, but I got the smaller size which I thought was a little over priced for the size, but still I'm glad with the choice I made.  The interior was very comfy kind of a cool laid back feel, it reminded me of places I visited in Portland.  I am a fan!"}
{"text":"I really like Cartel's coffee, but the service there is honestly not awesome. I feel like I'm walking into a place where I'm not welcome. Baristas ring me up with no friendliness and don't tell you where anything is in the store. I feel like Cartel is a great place for people who are friends with everyone who works there, but really not welcoming to customers off the street in general..."}
{"text":"I'm quite sure that we stopped by this joint at just the right time on a Friday afternoon.  Not too many hipsters, not too many students and the right blend of randomness.  The interior design is kind of a modern / do it yourself type of vibe - which is quite unassuming and warm.  I instantly liked it because I found out not only do they have awesome coffee, but they make their own craft beer.  I ordered a flight, offering a sample of all they have on tap and really enjoyed what they had to offer, especially the Desert IPA.  They have tons of space to stretch out and open up your laptop, and the service was quite friendly.  A little bit of people watching and we were on our way next door to Casey Moore's.  Definitely a worthy place to stop by for a beverage!"}
{"text":"I know it must be hard to be a coffee company competing in the world with Starbucks and I get the hook this place is trying to pull off BUT here's the deal, you can't be hipster and elitist and the same time.  I tried to order a vanilla latte and I thought that the woman behind the counter was going to stroke out right in front of me.  \"We really don't recommend you put flavoring in our coffee\" Well I really don't recommend you scold customers when they try to pay for your product. I will drink my coffee however I like it.  I don't need a undereducated, 30 year old barista to tell me how I should drink my lattes.  Sooo if you like over priced coffee BLACK and black only then go on down to Cartel but if you ask for sugar be ready for a berating - don't worry that part is fee they don't charge extra for it."}
{"text":"We tried Cartel because it was very highly rated as the \"best coffee in Arizona.\"  The customer service proved to be just that. These people put a lot of pride and care into their work and they really care that the customer has a very positive experience. 

The coffee, however, was lacking. All three of us ordered something different and all three returned or dumped them in the trash. Not even drinkable. 

We were refunded and received tons of apologies from the team and they offered is free food and drink but we passed.  It's the service that earns them three stars. The coffee doesn't even get one. Yech!"}
{"text":"You'll love their coffee if you enjoy lighter/medium roasts versus the super dark and robust ones. I came an hour or so before they closed on a Sunday, and was the only customer there for the majority of the time. They didn't have the tasting notes for the different varieties listed anywhere, so I had the girl working there (maybe Bree?) for more information. She was super knowledgeable, and recommended the Burka Gudina (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cartel-coffee-lab-phoenix-3?select=fn1sVLtY9ThO2_qwdYFD6Q#fn1sVLtY9ThO2_qwdYFD6Q) and Puerta Verde (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cartel-coffee-lab-phoenix-3?select=fn1sVLtY9ThO2_qwdYFD6Q#0qEIaMqyUGn0cw_Fg9mfhg). She was also nice enough to give me a free cup of drip coffee of the Burka, which took her almost 10 minutes to make since each step was done so carefully! So far, I have been loving the medium bodied Burka, but it wasn't cheap- two bags of beans cost me around $35, with the Burka being more expensive since it was considered premium. The whole coffee beans here are a bit of a splurge, but they rank right up there with Blue Bottle from SF and Stumptown from Portland in my opinion. Cartel is a must stop in Phoenix if you're a coffee lover!"}
{"text":"Do you enjoy 3oz of coffee? This is the place for you. Cool atmosphere but was horrified at the sizing and price. Yes they can do fancy lattes for your IG page, but I was not impressed with paying $3.75 for a mug of regular coffee that wasn't refillable for free. Never again. When I want coffee, I want a small bathtub filled with it, not a shot glass."}
{"text":"Cartel went from zero to hero in my heart. 

They introduced me to Chemex brewing (my new personal choice), and I have had several pleasant experiences since my first visit.

Since August, their ordering system seems more intuitive, the only employees I've been encountering are very patient yet highly efficient and they've reorganized the place.  

Way to go Cartel.  You've officially changed my mind."}
{"text":"Quite the disappointment. Got a regular drip. Very bitter. Plus the guy collecting my payment made sure I saw the tip feature before moving on. Really? You took my order and poured a (not very good) coffee."}
{"text":"Coffee, music, and buur...

I dig this joint!  It's like walking into a brew house with some random people hanging out.  Live music and freshly made coffee.  I have to say one of the best coffees I had in a long time.  I'm no coffee snob by any means, but shazam! This coffee hit the spot and punched me in the face \"in a good way -- if there's such a thing as getting punched in the face, but enjoying it....\", and woke my senses up! 

What else is cool and I dig about Cartel is you can order alcoholic beverages.  Coffee and Beer -- Aside from water, my two most sought after and preferred drinks!  Cartel is like my kryptonite - I must succumb to your bidding....must be strong and ahhhh...more more coffee, more more, pleasssse! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool little coffee joint.  I had me a shot of espresso along with what appeared to be club soda.  Definitely something new to me.  Espresso was super strong so I understood why the chaser was necessary.  Too strong for me actually and my friends told me the coffee there is extra potent.

Truthfully, I felt out of place being here.  This place was made for the following:

1. Students
2. Hipsters

I'm neither of the 2, but I can respect them.  Oh to be young and angry again!  Indeed, my neatly tucked in shirt and polished shoe is not welcomed - haha!  Good thing I didn't wear a suit might be mistaken for being \"The Man\"!  

In any case, I gather this place is a wonderful spot for hanging with friends and study groups. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great coffee!!  I would drink their coffee black and that's saying something.  I usually refuse to drink my coffee black.  
This is a great place to study or hang out wit friends.  They have a lot of seating.  The outside looks kind of sketch, but do not let that scare you away!"}
{"text":"Bad address....actually at 810 Ash Street, off University.  Please update as was very hard to find!"}
{"text":"Cartel is impeccable to say the very least.  Cartel Coffee Lab, has it all.  The vibe was very relaxing, the baristas knew their stuff, and the coffee quality was unbelievably good.  I haven't had the entire menu, but if it is as good as their pastries, then my goodness they are onto something.  I have only been there a few times, with the way things are going, it is possible I be coming on a regular basis.  The staff/customer interaction i have seen is awesome.  As an ex-Starbucks barista, that was the goal I had, enriching people's lives one cup at a time, and that is indeed what I have seen from them.  The only thing I would improve is adding a few more comfortable pieces of furniture, other than that the décor is great, with a simplistic/trendy look appeals pretty industrial.  The branding is fantastic, I'm telling you, it's everything you can ask for in a coffee shop...excuse me, coffee lab.
Kudos to you guys, keep up the hard work as you maintain making it look easy."}
{"text":"Cartel is not your run of the mill coffee shop.  They have exceptional coffee, teas and offer a variety of breakfast choices, sandwiches and some salads.  They are conveniently located in the heart of downtown, within walking distance.  This is a sister location from their main coffee lab in Tempe.

They roast their beans in Tempe and ship to this location daily to ensure a fresh and delicious brew.  Like most other coffee places, they are very selective in the coffee they buy for their customers.  They seem to be proficient roasters for their coffee is smooth and ambrosial. 

I like their breakfast especially the Big Ben ~ English muffin with scramble-ee eggs, bacon, tomato topped with harvarti cheesy goodness and some yummy chipotle aioli!  You'll need a couple of napkins : -)  They also have a couple of salad choices ~ cob, spring mix and tuna,  which is what I will try on my next visit. 

Suggestion: If you're going to meetings downtown, stop buy and pick up a great cup of joe at Cartel on your way to your destination, then go back to Cartel after lunch.  They usually have \"pastry happy hour\" in the afternoons with half priced bakery goods.  Take some delicious delights home with you to share with your family after dinner."}
{"text":"The baristas are tested and trained to the highest degree. I love going into shops and having nerdy coffee conversations about origins, brew methods, etc. and I got just that here.

A big criticism of the Third Wave coffee movement is that it is all about educating the consumer. Education is cool and important, but you have to treat customers like humans first and foremost and I definitely got that here!

When I moved to Phoenix a couple months ago, Cartel was one of my favorites. It's been a few trips since I have had a great cup though, progressively becoming an average shop."}
{"text":"Wow! For a coffee stop, this place knocked my socks off! The decor was trè cool; industrial steel tables, weird concrete/steel seating cubes, mix 'n' match wood chairs, bike rims sculptural divider, and on and on with much coolness. Ordered a simple espresso and was surprised and delighted that I was also given a glass of premise made seltzer. The espresso was lovely and had good body and very nice crema. Service was attentive, efficient and courteous and the prices quite reasonable. If I were a local, is be there all the time

Also, it looked like there will be or already have opened a section to serve wine/cocktails. Nice!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first stop at the downtown Phoenix location. Overall, I was pretty pleased. The shop is small, but still very modern looking and clean. There was little wait for 9 a.m. The menu is full of your standard copy shop fare. I ordered a 16 oz almond milk latte. The price was a bit steep at $5, but I guess that's what you pay for hipness. My drink was ready relatively quickly. The espresso was smooth and rich, while the almond milk was less watery than what you usually find at major coffee chains. Cartel is a solid choice if you're in the downtown Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Funky little coffee joint by ASU, roasting, grinding & brewing fresh beans using the best processes- V60, Chem and Pour-over. Smooth Rawandan coffee as well as Kenyan, Mexican and other fresh brews. Kiddos had Iced Chai and you could tell the chai flavors were House-made. Lots of space inside for hanging out, small areas for meetings and lots of outlets for students or folks there to do work. The only downside of this place was its pastry options- a bit of a sad selection of things you may see at a big-box store and nothing that jumped out as unique options that matched the high-end coffee."}
{"text":"Love their chai tea. The expansion and additions in recent years have been really nice. I remember several occasions when I couldn't find a seat anywhere. So thankful that's not the case now - thanks for expanding! The noise level is usually low enough for working or studying, and the music selection is good.

My only complaint is the vibe given off by some of the employees. A few times I have felt almost unwelcome in the coffee shop. I am placing my order and the employee could not care less. The \"too cool for you,\" hipster standoffish attitude can come across unpleasant. Where is the customer service? Smile more, I promise you everything is awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm normally an emotional mess at airports - it's hard to leave people behind! So, I actually found a small spot of happiness here in Terminal 4. When walked in here, I felt as if I were transported to Portland, OR! There was a bit of a hipster vibe, from the chalkboard menu to the iPad registers to the bow-tied and thick-rimmed glasses baristas! 

I ordered a chai tea latte, and it was a well-spiced, creamy drink with very large ice cubes. It lifted my spirits =]"}
{"text":"One of the best cold brews in the valley of the sun.  Quick tip: Cartel is next to gate C11.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee. Super friendly service, without pretentiousness. They get busy!

Try the poptart... Tasty!"}
{"text":"i love Cartel. i first fell in love with the downtown location, but soon discovered that there is one close by my house! and open late! YAYYYYY!!!!

true, the barista here can be a bit.... too cool for school.... but crafts a mean espresso. the cookies here are...... really really good. and i'm one of the biggest cookies snobs ever. seriously. i am. huge snob. me. and these are some of my faves. and they are 1/2 off if you go towards the end of the day! wooohooooooo"}
{"text":"There are so many good options for coffee now in downtown but for me, Cartel is the best of the best. They have a good selection of brews(particularly some really interesting choices from Costa Rica and Nicaragua)and an awesome breakfast and lunch menu. And the atmosphere is really cool. What also stands out to me is the service. I always get my Americano served up by a big smile and a \"How's your day going?\" Definitely no coffee snob attitude here and I love it."}
{"text":"When I think of Cartel, I think of home (but with incredible, delicious coffee). Cartel offers the best, top-notch coffee roasted and brewed in the valley...but although the coffee is superb, the people behind the counter make this much more than a place to pick up a latte. The manager, Ben greets me as a best friend every time I come in, and the rest of the staff remembers my past orders, my questions on life, and they genuinely listen every day I walk through the front door.

The setting of Cartel is perfect for good conversations, the music playlist is everything you'd want, and the snacks from Phoenix Public Market are extremely hard to avoid eating (because they're delicious). If you need to get work done, head to the back room where it's quiet and ideal for knocking out a homework or work assignment.

In general, I cannot recommend this place more. Ben, Kiley, and Mark have become friends that I look forward to seeing each time I come in. I buy their beans, make cold brew at home from their instructions, and often come just to sit and hang out. If there was a six star review, I'd give it to them.

Bravo."}
{"text":"Really chill atmosphere. Their coffee was splendid. I had the Chemex with their Ethiopian blend. Really really good!"}
{"text":"If I'm doing a business networking coffee meeting in Scottsdale, Cartel is one of my go-to places - delicious coffee and my companion said their tea was excellent. Even though it wasn't on the official menu they made me a hot chocolate. 

Cartel has good ambiance for getting work done - a lot of people sit at the tables with their laptops and earbuds. There are plenty of outlets to go around.

The staff is super friendly and mellow which I love."}
{"text":"I figured it out.  Phoenicians are so deprived of good coffee, they have no idea what it is, and if it bit them in the ass they still wouldn't know what it was.

I don't let friends drink Starbucks so I certainly wasn't feeling Sbux when I was at a conference here, about two blocks from this joint.  As far as coffee goes, this place was ok.  I got an iced mocha with an extra shot (on the recommendation of the barista when I said I was from NYC and needed some \"good shit.\").  The people were very nice there.  The coffee though...I've had better.  Sorry.  

But the kicker was the peanut butter bacon chocolate chip cookie.  Well all righty.  Interesting concept, not sure I'd get it again though."}
{"text":"I love Cartel. So I have been there multiple times. Love their coffee and pastries. Love love the environment, so non-cheesy and lots fun."}
{"text":"Roasting coffee on the spot with their fancy coffee roaster, best place to buy coffee beans with tons of flavor!  Smooth coffee, pretty decent draft beer selection too.  Had the banana bread and the carrot cake w the fam, everything was awesome, including Daniel the coffee roaster."}
{"text":"I love local coffee shops, and this place is definitely a winner. It's got a kind of hipster feeling to it. They have an enclosed outdoor patio with plenty of tables and sitting room, as well as an inside area. The staff is very friendly. 

They offer a variety of different coffees, such as Chemex, cold brew, drip, etc. I had their black coffee (which is the best way to judge a coffee shop). The roast was bold and had an excellent nutty flavor. The coffee beans were very high quality."}
{"text":"This obscure place is well worth looking for.  I enjoyed a yummy coffee and relaxed with friends while sitting and enjoying the original art work and the eclectic decor.  I'm going back, next time I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"great place to drink coffee it gets really busy but my girlfriend loves the one and one, roasted coffee is the best kind of coffee its a bit spendy but well worth the drive out there"}
{"text":"Friendly service, excellent coffee, and a warm atmosphere make this place a good respite for the weary traveler.  On my next trip to Phoenix, I will definitely be stopping in for a quick caffeine fix."}
{"text":"Really liked this cafe, had a really nice conversation with the barista. Barista is skilled and he knows what he's doing. if you're from a different country hit this place up! It's great. I am a barista in Canada so you could say it's been approved by another barista for its quality"}
{"text":"Super cute place. The coffee is great tasting. I got an americano. My friends weren't sure what the order, the barista was very helpful to them. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Needed some caffeine while waiting on my flight. This place had a big advertisement saying it was the best coffee in Arizona. Decided to try it even though there was safe options like Starbucks and Panera around. Ordered a  caramel latte but they ended up being out of caramel. The barista said she could make an agave/vanilla latte and assured me it would taste similar. It did! It was good. I was happy she gave me the option and didn't just say they didn't have caramel."}
{"text":"What an amazing discovery on our trip to Tempe!  Hands down some of the best coffee I have ever had in my life!  Just....wow.  Went there two mornings in a row and had two different roasts.  So wonderfully rich, roasty, full flavored and delicious I didn't even need my usual sweetener.  

Besides the coffee being extraordinary, this place just has a cool, funky vibe. The baristas were so friendly, the music was fun, and the atmosphere is unlike no other.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the Tempe area. The only negative I have to say is that it didn't open up early enough early for me to get another hit before we departed at 6am  :(  

Love you Cartel Cofffee Lab!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. If you find yourself in the Phoenix airport with even a small layover, find this coffee shop. Some of the best I've ever had. Not fast service, but so worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have been going to Cartel for a while, and their coffee has absolutely spoiled me. I can hardly drink coffee or esspresso from anywhere else, I even buy their beans and brew it at home.
Most of the bartista's are stellar, but expect to wait for your specialty drinks, not only because they are almost always busy, but also because making kick ass coffee drinks takes time.
I suggest either the Honduras with cream, an iced agave latter, or a cappuccino (which you have to drink there)."}
{"text":"Great local coffee joint. My husband loves their pour overs. I love their chai tea."}
{"text":"Wow- they have the best cookies in the world!!!!  Very nice Staff and fresh Orange Juice.  I will have to say thumbs up to Cartel.  They really focused on what the customer needs and wants are.  Very happy to come back real soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"One star for being local, hip, serving beer on tap, and having a cool ambiance. But as far as espresso goes. EEEK! If my Americano hadn't cost $4, I would have thrown it in the trash (most sour, bitter, disgusting espresso I've ever tasted). And I wanted to love this place - took a trip to Old Town just for them. So sad. 

P.S. Not to sound pretentious but rather to establish some credibility: as a born-and-raised Seattleite who's been drinking espresso everywhere since I was 12 in dozens of states and a few different countries, I know a bit about how good espresso should taste. This is not it."}
{"text":"Cartel is amazing, so I'll keep it short and sweet. Go. Here. Very friendly staff and even better coffee. I will recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Just please, buy a drink before you go and work there for hours. It's a great neighborhood business, so support!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor of this place because I enjoy the positive energy and the artsy, inspirational vibes. Everytime I go I order an iced chai latte which is always prompt and DELICIOUS! I always go for seconds. There was once I received a watered down tea at the same time I got bad customer service, but I believe it was the individual that was helping me out, and I havn't seen him since. Other than that, all the pastries I've tried are delicious, their dirty chais are2 AMAZING, the location is beautiful, and the staff is friendly. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone that enjoys a little hipster coffee time fun, whether it be doing work, homework, or playing a nice game of scrabble. THIS PLACE ROCKS!!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee you can tell they really care. However it does take a little too long to get your coffee and it is not convenient to park."}
{"text":"Had an incredibly long layover in Phoenix (approx 6 hours to kill) and spent most of it sitting near my gate at Starbucks. Around lunchtime, I decided to take a walk around the airport to see if anything sounded good and nothing did.  A friend from Arizona has always raved about Paradise Bakery, so I was curious to see how it measured up to all the Panera's I've ever been to.  I know that it isn't really fair to judge a place by an airport location, but there was nothing appealing about it to me and topping that off with the fact that their credit machine was inop, I decided to look elsewhere.

Cartel was right next door, and a quick search on my phone revealed that this is a locally owned business.  I was sold.  I ordered a latte, which was excellent, and a zucchini and goat cheese scone, which may have been the best scone I've ever had in the US.  It was pricey, but there are definitely worse places to spend $8.  I enjoyed that drink and snack way more than I would have enjoyed anything else in the airport."}
{"text":"I loved getting my coffee beans there (they roast them and sell them already ground if you have a espresso machine) but the recent price increase of over $4.00 a pound will keep me from buying anymore. Now for a pound of coffee, they charge $20 - $25 a bag (1 pound) it was already steep at $16 - $20 depending on the kind you bought and they have raised it again ONLY IF YOU BUY IT BY THE BAG and not any increase if you came in to buy a latte or coffee. It's crazy! 

It was very good coffee which made up for the rude barista's since I didn't have to sit there. Grab the coffee and go, but no more sadly unless they drop their prices back to the already inflated price of $16 for a pound."}
{"text":"Love the coffee and the atmosphere! I get everything from my 4 shot latte to my whole beans for more morning coffee there its a great place!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what someone should expect a top tier third wave coffee shop to be. Hipster interior, multiple single origin offerings, as well as multiple \"slow\" brew methods. 

I had their one and one which is a shot of espresso along with the same shot with steamed milk. It allows you to see the impact of milk on the taste of an espresso. It's a great experience and my single origin espresso was great. 

I also made sure to try a espresso excelente or their iced horchata latte. Horchata is already delicious and adding a shot of espresso might have made it better. Hard to know for sure, but it definitely didn't make it worse. Strongly recommend this sweet treat."}
{"text":"Haven't tasted coffee this good in a year. These ppl truly know how to make quality coffee. Their dirty chai is truly \"dirty\", but in a good way. Love the atmosphere. It's mostly filled with my fellow Generation Y'ers but it's still has a good mix of different age groups. A great place to meet up and discuss ideas, be productive, and just socialize. This will surely be my regular spot once I move to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Cool Place to work, and have great coffee."}
{"text":"I just don't understand places like this. Be unique and different, cool....but where does the customer service go? I don't care if you are trying to be a cool local hangout, you still need to be personable and friendly. Starbucks may be big business, but most of the time they treat me right. 

Now for the product. It was a terrible Americano. I do not know what they put in it, but it was awfully sour and bitter. 

The atmosphere is not pleasant and the seating is uncomfortable and industrial."}
{"text":"Amazing to have this at the airport, actual GOOD coffee! The usual option I feel kinda sucks.. So this was appreciated! Good service."}
{"text":"Great spot.. The first stop in town, the interior was great, service very good. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Thank you, yelpers, for introducing me to Cartel Coffee Lab!  
It's a bit hidden, but since you suggested it as the location for our December Office Hours, I found it and fell in heavy like at first sight!

In speaking with the owners, Jason and Amy, I learned that they opened Cartel in January 2008.  That means it's almost their first birthday... yay!  They offer all kinds of coffee and tea specialty drinks and use the best of the best equipment in preparing each drink.  I went with a soy latte yesterday but saw others order chai tea, capuccino, pineapple mango iced tea, etc... The cups they use for \"drinking in\" and those they use for \"to go\" are all top notch, eco-friendly, etc... the store itself is adorable and perfect for lounging, meeting a friend, working, or reading.  I took advantage of free wifi while I was there too!

During the 4+ hours that I was there yesterday, Cartel stayed pretty packed.  Don't go there if you're in a rush... go if you have a few minutes to chat with the owner(s) and the regular(s) and enjoy your cup of joe.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that there is no food.  I think it's because they are not licensed to serve food, but the good thing is that you can bring in something if you're hungry (like a few of us did yesterday).

Cartel is a winner in my book - Happy almost birthday... hope to come celebrate with you in the new year!"}
{"text":"I just had my first downtown cartel experience and it did not disappoint. At 7:30pm, my husband went for his fourth cup of coffee today... Being that it's Cartel coffee, he will likely be up until 4am. I went for a hot chocolate. 

We recognized Jules, the barista, from the old town location. He was friendly and super knowledgeable about the coffee and the variety of other drinks and eats that they offer. Who knew that cartel even brews their own beer now (at the Tempe location)? They make all of their baked goods in house now too... I had to use major will power not to order any of their delicious looking treats. 

As we were leaving we noticed a group coming in to perform... I guess they offer live music.  All in all, a pleasant downtown cartel experience, and I just finished my hot chocolate... mmmm!"}
{"text":"They are really snooty about coffee. When I wanted four shots of espresso in one cup, they refused and gave me four little cups--each with a saucer! One epresso may be enough for a 140-pound hipster, but not for me. Oh, the epresso is THE best so I have to put up with their crap."}
{"text":"This place was just fantastic all around.  The service was fast and very friendly.  We chatted with the baristas and servers for a bit, and they really know their coffee and products.

I had a double Macchiato that was prepared perfectly, and the coffee was so sweet on its own that I didn't want any added sugar.  Their BLT has a soft egg on it, making for a very tasty sandwich that I keep thinking about.

My wife had some sort of caramel pastry that seemed to be made of lightly cooked cookie dough with a huge slab of caramel in the middle.  It was simply stunning."}
{"text":"SUPER good espresso - I tried a soy latte and it was quite good.  The interior was interestingly (though nicely) decorated and was really cozy.  It's definitely an artsy/modern hang out spot with a friendly vibe but it was almost overwhelmingly so.
Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Bad coffee, great atmosphere and wonderful teas. Coffee falls short since it has a sour and dirty after taste. However, the teas are bold in flavor and the atmosphere is the best place to study."}
{"text":"So as usual I dragged my a$$ over to the airport at 5 AM Monday morning to catch the 6 am to SJC. Had overslept so did not have time to enjoy my morning Nespresso. Looked at the long line at the Starbucks, decided to skip it and go to C18 resigned to the thought of having the cardboard coffee in the plane. When I neared the gate, the smell of coffee dragged me to the Cartel kiosk...seeing no one in the line, I half halfheartedly ordered the Latte, thinking this will be yet another cooked coffee from another Espresso machine.

To my surprise I got a latte with a coffee leaf in my cup, which in itself woke me up, and I took one sip of the coffee.... Wow !!! (Imagine me standing like that guy in Ratatouille, this coffee took me back to the super strong South Indian coffee that Mom used to make) 

I plan to go to the Airport early, and trek all the way to C13 no matter where my flight is to get this coffee every time I am in Skyharbor."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been stopping here on the weekends recently.  The staff is always super friendly and their drinks are great.  I've never like coffee.  Ever.  I've tried it a couple times throughout my life and it's just never done it for me, so I've always been a tea girl.  THEN, my husband and I went to Cartel one day and while he was tending to our toddler, I went to put some cream in his iced coffee.  I had a little bit of an overflow dilemma, and there were no towels or any potential clean up devices in sight.  So I was forced to take a sip to prevent the spill... and I was shocked and pleasantly surprised that I actually LIKED the coffee!  It wasn't bitter or nasty at all.  Very smooth and delicious, and creamy because of, well, the cream.  My poor husband only got to drink about half his coffee that day, and then deal with me being wired for the next few hours.

The usual tea I get there is always great, too.  I've only tried one so far, the black mango pineapple (or something along those lines) and it's delish!  Mildly sweet and fruity, extremely yummy.  

I like the way the interior is designed, with bike tires and interesting photos on the walls.  My toddler loves to look around and inquire about what everything is.  There's never been a long wait and we've been there at different times on weekend mornings.  Early-ish, and later towards the afternoon.  Never overly crowded, never empty.  We'll be back again and again because now I'm hooked on their iced coffee.  It only took 27 years."}
{"text":"This is the smoothest cappuccino in Phoenix. Great offerings of classic drinks and diverse cold brew options that are all out of this world. Their baristas truly go above and beyond to make sure your drink is perfect!
 I can't come here without grabbing a bag of beans to make at home! Convenient locations around town make it easy to always get a great cup when you need one. 

One caveat: not a lot of bathroom options. There was a long line and it wasn't the cleanest, but otherwise 10/10!"}
{"text":"The best coffee shop in Phoenix. I've had everything from cappuccinos to their cold brew and never been disappointed. Also plenty of space to spread out and get some work done if you need to get out of the office."}
{"text":"This place is not for me. Their cold brew is ok. Nothing to write home about. Baked goods are great. They come from Phoenix public market which is a fantastic place. I tried the airopress which was better then the drip coffee. The place was dirty and unorganized. I enjoyed the vibe there. All in all, not bad product. It's not enough to get me to come back though. :/"}
{"text":"Was turned on to Cartel by a friend. My first visit I wasn't really sure what to order. Menu is kinda bare but I think that's the point. The barista was very friendly and more than happy to give me different recommendations. Their cold brew is their staple and is the best cold brew I have had in town. The environment is a little hipster but it is nice and plenty of places to sit and charge your laptop or phone. Highly recommend Cartel."}
{"text":"One of the hippest coffee spots around.... Old Scottsdale.

This is the place to be for strong delicious coffee!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! The best coffee I have ever tasted, and the best chai I have ever tasted.  I had been wanting to try it out, and I picked my Uncle up from the airport and he wanted some coffee, so I knew I wanted to come here... My Uncle (AKA Funkle - funny Uncle) is diabetic, so he wanted some splenda with his breve (if that is how it is spelt), and the guy said they try and make the coffee good enough that it doesn't need sugar, he was RIGHT!! I was the best coffee I have ever tasted.  You can tell they know what they are doing and are passionate about it.  I will be here ever time I'm on this side of town!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love little hearts in their cappuccino? 

A bit intimidating to visit the first time or two, especially if you are by yourself.  The place was packed, but everyone was super into their laptops, and just sneaking covert glances over top to see who came and went.  Drinks take a while to come out (which is fine - hearts take time) but I felt a bit scrutinized while waiting.  (I was dressed biz-casual as I work nearby and felt like I was dressed to the nines in a dive bar.)

Anyway, aside from the bit of awkwardness I experienced, my cappuccino was delish, and I love that they serve in actual glass glasses and not plastic cups.  (They're called glasses for a reason people!)

I will be back, and as long as I arm myself with a \"devil may care\" attitude if I'm wearing work attire, I know it will be an enjoyable visit."}
{"text":"We came to the down town location for the first time yesterday and I was even more impressed.  The service was sooo nice, the food was great, and the coffee was to die for of course.  We had the breakfast sandwich with bacon and the burrito with bacon, they were both great, I liked the sandwich the best, the chipotle made it sooo yummy.  They aren't small, we could have shared one and been full."}
{"text":"Your experience really depends on who is working when you arrive.  One time that I came the barista was enthusiastic and helpful.  The second time, the person working literally did not speak to us.  It was quite awkward.  Overall, cartel sells great beans and makes a great cup of coffee.  Its not always a great experience though."}
{"text":"I stopped in after running the RNR Marathon this past weekend.  I ordered a Clever of the guji from the board.  Overall, it was a pretty good cup of coffee.  Not my favorite (I'm a huge yirgacheffe fan), but good.  I also tried the cherry pop-tart, which was amazing!  I highly recommend!  Great neighborhood coffee shop.  I'll definitely stop back in if I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"Flying out of Sky Harbor early AM, what a great.  Worth the wait.  Try something u inquest and you won't be disappointed.  One and one was delicious and fun to watch the preparation.  Try a cold brew, I did t try one, but appreciated the handcrafted one I saw being made."}
{"text":"Love their coffee, but I asked for almomd milk in my latte however they put regular milk in it which made my stomach upset. Always double check before you leave!"}
{"text":"Really knowledgable here. Makes  coffee an experience rather than a product being sold. I had the Chemex, guy took pride in everything he was doing."}
{"text":"Great hipster place!  Love the atmosphere and the service was great! Very attentive and patient with little ol' indecisive me as the guy provided beer samples until we found just the right one I liked!  :) The organic sugar syrup for the coffee is a great touch too!! The regulars giggled as they watched me try to figure it out!! Definitely a great place to hang out... even solo!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place has THE BEST coffee I have ever tasted.  Bottom Line.  I didn't get the \"everyone is required to wear skinny jeans\" vibe that a previous reviewer stated, so I would definitely give this place a try before writing it off.  If you love coffee, this place is not to be missed.  And I am not talking about the \"Venti Chocolate Chip Frap\" type of coffee.  If you like drinks like that then this place is not for you, but if you love the idea of each cup of coffee being made specifically for each customer and supporting an establishment that is truly passionate about their product, than check this place out."}
{"text":"One of the cool things about Phoenix Sky Harbor is that they are bringing in locally own businesses into the terminals for  all to try, I like that a lot!

I was searching for coffee and walked by Starbucks and saw the line was out the door so I just kept heading towards my gate and thank gawd I did, when I turned the corner I found Cartel Coffee!! Oh yes I was very happy.

The staff was friendly and helpful, I walked right up and ordered an large mocha, this was a great looking cup of coffee great tasting too! Loved it

If your looking for a cup of joe, you should skip Starbucks and head on over to Cartel Coffee forsure!"}
{"text":"Microbrewery & coffee house? Hello Cartel where have you been hiding all this time!

Some have said if you want atmosphere head on over the Lux, but I think that's discrediting what Cartel has to offer.  Lux and Cartel Coffee are 2 different styles, respect the differences. 

Was in the area and found Cartel by fluke, I was in need of some coffee, yes I can admit I am a caffeine junkie and Cartel was my dealer, from the board above you can tell this a coffee joint (ok they have tea too if coffee isn't your thing).  I went with a Latte, which was perfectly blended with a cute little heart design, so sweet.  

With coffee in hand I gave this place a more through look threw, I like the vibe of it, lots of seating room. I didn't realize it was a microbrewery until I had the coffee in hand; I'm intrigued and need to come back and inspect that soon.

Since Cartel isn't that far from me I'm sure I will become a regular in no time haha.  Glad to find another place to get a good cup a joe."}
{"text":"CARTEL COFFEE LAB is awesome. The coffee is delicious and the staff very knowledgable and speaks to the detail of their coffee beans, roasting and preparation. The shop is tiny, clean and fresh. They also serve wine and beer. I didn't try any. Location 5th and Craftsman has plenty of free parking. There's also a cool bench out front where you can sit and sip."}
{"text":"Hands down the best coffee in town. Great atmosphere and setup for mobile working. I spent almost 4 months writing my dissertation there and the staff was always amazing. Still my go to place for working and enjoying a good espresso."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and I stumbled upon it after riding the light rail. The staff is incredibly friendly and made recommendations for what exactly to order. I settled on getting a cappuccino and they certainly did not disappoint! They did fun coffee art on top and the coffee itself was very strong! The prices are very fair and the atmosphere is really relaxing! I will definitely be back to explore more!"}
{"text":"Iced coffee of the day heaven!! I am so excited, I can't stand it! Okay maybe not that excited, but you would be too if you had gone to 8 different places, and they all had terrible coffee. Why do so many places think that an iced coffee equates to melted ice cream in a cup, with a ton of sugar, and no coffee flavor? Anyway, I didn't experience any of the snobby behavior so many have commented on. In fact everyone was very helpful and friendly. I can't wait to come back and try more coffee!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location once and I already love it. One of their expert baristas, Kelsey, is so friendly and personable. She truly knows how to do customer service well, which makes all the difference in the coffee experience. 

I ordered my go-to drink: a soy cappuccino. It's beautiful as always."}
{"text":"I waited for 5 minutes and the barista didn't even acknowledge me, he was just busy chatting with another customer. Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I walked here from Tempe Center for the Arts for a coffee during a break in the dress reharsal for Breaking Ground this weekend.

Very comfortable vibe, engaging barristas.

Truly excellent coffee.

I wish there were a place to sit outside though.

Instead, I drank mine while walking back to TCA.

Don't get to do that often enough in this Valley.

I'll be back to Cartel whenever I want sit-in coffee."}
{"text":"Cartel!! I want every flight to stop in PHX just to have this perfect coffee experience-- in an AIRPORT no less! Kudos-- this is amazing stuff."}
{"text":"Best iced coffee of my life. Unbelievable. So fresh, so good.

Very good tuna salad.

Gigantic animal heads on the wall: odd."}
{"text":"I love Cartel! It is always my routine to grab one on my way through the Southwest gate at Sky Harbor. If you have the time, definitely take a seat and let them brew you a fresh Chemex cup while you wait on your flight. You'll never want a \"Charbucks\" again! 
I love their location in downtown Scottsdale as well!"}
{"text":"This is my go to for the past 5 years. Lately there has been hit or miss on cold brew, but other than that I love going to Cartel. They always have different coffee offerings, which is fun!

Parking can be rough with the restrictions on the North side of Cartel, so park in the rear (south side) to avoid a ticket!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Megan was so delightful to work with that I can't wait to go back and hang out there again. Definitely a must visit!"}
{"text":"Came here to Cartel Coffee Lab in C section of terminal 4 at the airport.  Quite frankly, we didn't want to walk all the way out to the Starbucks that was in the area after the TSA check so it was nice to stumble upon this gem.  

I got a small iced mocha and it was pretty good.  It was definitely better than what Starbucks has to offer.  My drink did take a while to make but I'll chalk it up to the baristas carefully crafting my beverage.  My flight was delayed by 20 minutes so I wasn't going anywhere anyway.  My friend got the spicy coffee (I forget the name) and it was quite unique. I've always wanted to try something like that but couldn't commit to a full drink.  It was definitely spicy.  I'm sure it's an acquired taste and lots of people like it, but I probably wouldn't want to be as adventurous next time.

I'll have to try some of their different offerings next time I'm there."}
{"text":"awesome.  Small, local spot -just what we look for when we travel.  After living in the Northwest (Seattle area) for a long while we've grown accustomed to outstanding coffee (NOT starbucks) and this place was great.  Atmosphere was really unique and laid back as well with semi-outdoor seating.  I also noticed they have a small but legit beer selection.  When I was there they had on tap Odell Mercenary IPA, Firestone Velvet Merlin, and a few others.  Whoever orders their beers obviously knows what good beer is.  We didn't end up getting any but a good sign nonetheless.  Service was good and they were friendly.  We ended up buying a mug because they are pretty cool too.  Overall, superb place to stop in and have a leisurely coffee.

Definitely going back next time we are in the Dale"}
{"text":"Serious place with a very comfortable setup.  Didn't partake but appreciate the beer selections, more places should do this.  Espresso was excellent, didn't need sweetener like it does at some national chains.  Music selection was not my style (I am definitely older than the target market) but still interesting and enjoyable while working for a half hour."}
{"text":"Cute little place.  Would be good for people working, was just ok for hanging out.  Coffee was solid. Would definitely return when in the area."}
{"text":"This place has the best dirty chai in Tempe! Their other espresso drinks are also consistently good. The only downside is that unless I go early in the morning, the pastries get sold out before I get there. Also, there aren't many outlets so it's not good for laptop studying."}
{"text":"Great quality strong coffee. I always get an iced vanilla latte and the strength of the coffee is still so evident THE BEST COFFEE IN PHOENIX FOR WAKING YOU UP. Always does the job of keeping me awake throughout a busy day!"}
{"text":"while waiting to check into my hotel, hung out here for a couple of hours. very good cappucino and iced coffee, delicious cookie, with free no hassle wifi, and cool vibe with seating options, clean huge windows and shared space with a yummy food business.  bookmarked!"}
{"text":"The best espresso I've had so far. 

I purchase my coffee here as well. It's always delicious, never bitter and of very high quality.

This coffee shop is my all time fav. I hope they stay open indefinitely. If you are in the area try them out. They have beer too!"}
{"text":"Great location and wonderful coffee! !  The atmosphere was also relaxed and a good place to hang out with friends or get some work done.  Enjoy it!!"}
{"text":"One of the top coffee spots in the nation. Place is no joke and consistent in greatness... Not necessarily flavor profile as that obviously changes by season and bean and so on and so forth, but they truly have a great method on lock down from roasting to the baristas. 

Currently the yirg z from yirgacheffe is amazing on v60 and chemex. 

Also amazing  8oz americano to go... Yes you have to get it in a to go cup... Not sure why but it's never as good in a washed porcelain. Just have them wash out the paper cup. I swear it's a million times better. ;)"}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff. Excellent coffee and pastries. Nice and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Enjoy the quality of espresso drinks :-) they have pour overs also; so far for the times I've come in, they bring my drink to me personally.  Excellent customer service!

They have a hardware-type decoration & furnishings.  Not my taste, but it's their identity, not mine."}
{"text":"I can only review based on coffee and a muffin but it was very good.  Super funky decor with chandeliers hanging low on the ground and brick face on walls.  Open kitchen created a wide roomy feel.  There were folks meeting and chatting over coffee.  

Service was very quick and good.  It was weird they didnt have a caramel latte on the menu but oh well.  The coffee was fine.  :-)"}
{"text":"I have been trying to come here forever and finally made it out on a Friday night.  I was surprised by the lack of a crowd.  Mistake number one was not listening to the honest barista.  I asked how was the decaf brew, and he provided an honest answer of \"not so good, I would not recommend it.\"  

Unfortunately he was correct.  The decaf Americano was bland and watery.  There was no depth, no roasted taste, really disappointing. 

I should have listened and avoided the decaf products."}
{"text":"I am so not impressed with cartel coffee. For starters the front counter help gentleman is a rude little pretentious snot.  It was beneath him to be polite and he wasn't hesitant to demonstrate that to me. After making me feel completely wrong for not ordering the correct cartel way... The icing on the cake with this gentleman was the fact that when I asked for a receipt he looked at me like I had four eyes. It turns out they only offer an email or text message receipt. I appreciate the idea of going green but sometimes a paper receipt is required.

My next encounter which was unfortunate was when my four drinks were ready... I asked if I could have the drinks marked and again this is against cartels policy. I was told that I would have to figure it out based on whether not they cups have a paper sleeve on them. That's kind of crazy since I have four different drinks.

I appreciate the idea of being a hipster joint or fashion week cool but not at the cost of customer service and customer appreciation. Maybe I'm just too darn old to order coffee in a college town. Then again, maybe Cartel should expect their employees to treat their paying customers with respect. 

Next time I'll... Who am I kidding?  It'll be a month of Sunday's before there is a next time."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service even though they weren't busy, got the order wrong, stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Definitely a very good craft coffee roaster. I enjoyed their Colombian single origin espresso and pour over. Great washed coffee with very buttery notes and a sweet, clean finish."}
{"text":"When the barrista poured my latte with a little leaf design in the foam, I was instantly in love.  I felt like I was back at Stumptown Coffee Roasters in my beloved Portland, OR.  The vanilla latte I ordered was smooth and delicious.  It was just the right temperature so I didn't have to blow on it for half an hour just to take a sip.  For coffee like this, you're gonna pay a little more, but frankly it's worth it.  Pass Starbucks quickly and head to Cartel in terminal 4."}
{"text":"Upon entering, I was immediately struck by the amazing playlist blasting through the speakers.  Yes, it was pretty loud, but when you've got MC Hammer jamming, loud is totally cool with me.  Do these Millennials even know who MC Hammer is?  Probably not.  The atmosphere is great, but the coffee is even better.  My hubby got one of those slow drip coffee things where it eliminates all the bitterness and really brings out the flavors of the beans.  He was a big fan of his.  I was loving my dirty iced chai.  This is one of those places that helps make Tempe as cool as it is."}
{"text":"price, flavor, service all fantastic. If you like good coffee, go. If you don't care about coffee, stop looking at coffee reviews and just go get your grande double whip hazelnut bullshit and stop pretending like you like anything but coffee flavored milk sugar."}
{"text":"Meh. 
Coffee is very acidic. 
Not very impressive, felt like I just added a spritz of lemon into my coffee."}
{"text":"Terrific coffee. So smooth. I had a mocha and lemon bread. So tasty. I can see why they are voted as one of the best coffees in Phoenix. 
Friendly staff. Will make just about any coffee drink you want. 
Sandwiches, salads, pastries. Something for everyone. A great stop for food and drink in between flights. Go there."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite coffee spots.  They make one of the best vanilla lattes I've ever had.  The new cold brew floats look out of this world.  If there's a negative about this place, it's that it's not a place to go when you're in a hurry.  The staff are perfectionists about their craft, sometimes to the detriment of timely and/or friendly service."}
{"text":"Best vanilla latte anywhere."}
{"text":"Cool, hipster vibe. I really like the feel of the place, with recycled artwork and interesting, comfortable seating areas. The baristas were hipster as well, but were very friendly. Coffee was ready fast considering there was a line. I just got an Americano, which was decent - kind of strong for me, but I didn't want to use syrup as a sweetener. Anyway, I want to try other things, like the toddy. The rest of the menu doesn't seem very fancy, just the basics. It's nothing too elaborate, but I can't complain."}
{"text":"Best coffee on the west Coast! Takes about 15 min to brew a cup but it is well worth the wait. Great place"}
{"text":"Flying from El Paso to San Diego I had a stop in Phoenix at the airport. A friend of mine suggested trying Cartel.  Loved it. The cashier was friendly, attentive and quick. She took my order and it was ready in a minute. 

The  large coffee ($4.00) was fresh and didn't  need sugar or cream. I had 20 minutes before my next flight and this quick fix got me through it.

Thanks Cartel!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to add that they've added snacks to the menu. My next visit was better!"}
{"text":"The barista held nothing back in describing the flavor characteristics of their roasted beans, and helped me pick out the perfect coffee for me, it being my first time in the shop.  I eventually settled on the 24-hour cold brew coffee, which is amazing, an I'm looking forward to trying their other flavors.  

Big pluses are the friendly barista, atmosphere, and quality.  I'll definitely be coming back Macbook in hand to spend some more quality time here.  Maybe I'll be lucky enough to find some people to play chess with or make interesting conversation."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is awesome and coffee good.  Great alternative to my usual Starbucks"}
{"text":"Drinking coffee and Espresso has become my new hobby (or dare I say obsession) due in large part to the opening of this funky and original coffee Lab.  The passion of the owner, to stay true to traditional barista ways, is nothing short of extraordinary.  While enjoying one of their amazing drinks, the thought comes to mind, this is what coffee is supposed to taste like!!  Darn the behemoths of the coffee industry for herding us like cattle through their identical shops while shoving expensive sub par coffee our way.  I say no more!  I want to sip a perfectly made drink in a place that feels like home.  Cartel Coffee Lab is that place.  The sweet and fragrant smell of the freshly roasted beans lingers in the air.  I almost feel like the owner should charge for the smell alone.  Because the beans are roasted on site, you truly can not get a fresher cup of coffee anywhere.  There are no old pots of coffee hanging out indefinitely on their warmers.  Every cup of coffee is brewed fresh for around $1.  I know, don't even get me started on the prices!  Your buck is definitely getting \"banged\" at this place.  This place will not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"They sell a stimulant from South America and are called \"Cartel.\"

A joke's hiding in there, somewhere. 

Stopped by for the first time today. It wasn't easy to find, but that made it fun.  (Look in the BACK of the shopping center). I'm sure it's easy to miss!

All I have to say about my visit is... DAMN these guys serve a great cuppa joe. One of the best I've had. Ever."}
{"text":"Great coffee place. If I have any length of a layover I'll always run down to Cartel. Good quality coffee."}
{"text":"So busy I walked in and walked out and then scoffed at by one of the employees. Good luck getting a parking lot - and if so, a seat. I don't see what is so great about this place.. maybe they need another location nearby? Hipster crowd, yes, definitely."}
{"text":"Really good coffee & food.  I admit I wish they were open more into the evening time.  
What really caught my eye was the layout of the cafe.  They really did a great job designing this place."}
{"text":"Best cold brew I have had yet. Excellent shop as they also roast their beans in house. Bought a bag of beans and will be coming back here for sure. Plenty of floor space for sitting and a good mix of pastries."}
{"text":"My morning coffee is a must. Thankfully, Cartel is conveniently located near the office and hotels when I'm up in Scottsdale for work. This particular location, as mentioned before is a little snug compared to the stores we have in Tucson, but I like the coziness. Their no \"to go cappuccino\" policy is my only quibble. I totally get that they don't want to compromise the quality of their coffee with to go orders, but sometimes the customer needs it to go! Most importantly though, it's how the staff delivers the news. I appreciate the clever barista that was able to accommodate my Cortado order in a To go cup, how? He was creative"}
{"text":"I couldn't agree more with Lindsey D's sentiment- that it's totally worth the walk to Terminal 4 to enjoy a cup of coffee that delicious and local! Not to mention, actually worth the money. Cartel coffee is truly a gem not only in Phoenix, but we're lucky to have to stores in Tucson. They don't compromise on quality, so don't plan on taking that cappuccino to go! Sip on that coffee and enjoy....take a moment to block out the hectic energy of the airport. That's what this coffee stop is all about. They roast their beans locally and bake all of their own pastries fresh. A rare find in any airport."}
{"text":"Grabbed a green iced tea while out running around. Great service and great tea! WIFI here and great sitting place to come and relax with friends or to even do some work. Am told this is the first of their locations that now are in Scottsdale and a couple in Phoenix and Tucson! Definately should make it one of your coffee stops where ever you are!"}
{"text":"Seriously? It's been a couple years since I've reviewed Cartel and I just want to give 'em kudos again. Thank you universe for this little beaut and the fast, amazing baristas that run the place. When 1pm lunch rolls around nothing sounds better than running to Cartel from work for a pick me up and they never, ever fail me."}
{"text":"Another Yelp bookmarked place that was a winner! Ended up heading over to this area since we were going into the HTC place just next door to this particular location. We opted to give them a try since we were right there and this place had been on our list for some time.  

I'm a big fan of coffees, primarily hot mochas. As such, I ordered a medium hot mocha with much anticipation for good coffee, given the great reviews here, and was not disappointed. Not only was the coffee good, but the barista took the time to make a fun heart with the foam on the top of my coffee, which I just love! Art made of coffee? I mean who doesn't love that?

We revisited them a couple more times since then, and the coffee and service are consistent and excellent, which is what coffee persons want in a coffee shop, right? 

There are plenty of places to sit inside and some of these are located next to power sources for those that are looking to bring in a laptop and do other things while you're here. It's definitely geared towards the student and hipster crowds, and we aren't either of those things, but we didn't feel judged or unwanted despite it. We have gotten a negative vibe from some other coffee houses in town that have similar demographic crowds, but not here!

Overall: A
Fun artsy feel, great consistent coffee, quick service and fun foam designs!"}
{"text":"Was pretty skeptical about coming to this place reading the previous reviews about customer service and the ambiance. 

We ended up coming here forcing ourselves because the reviews about \"the best coffee in town\" really did catch my attention. We come in through the back and come to the counter asking if we came through the wrong door. The cashier really didn't mind and told us how many doors to the coffee shop their actually was - there are three. 

We come from the whole Starbucks iced caramel macchiato scene so we weren't too sure what to order. We asked the barista what she'd recommend to someone who enjoyed an iced CM from Starbucks and she mentioned the agave latte, white mocha, or the regular latte.

I'm pleased to announce that the agave latte is divine. The natural sweetener has a certain taste alongside the espresso.

My sister and my experience here could not have been more pleasing. Definitely coming back. :)"}
{"text":"Pros:
1. The best thing about this place is the vibe - Spacious, chill and hip but not over the top (well, maybe a little)
2. Really good, delicious coffee
3. The corn cookie, which reminded me of a giant sweet cornflake

Con:
Why the plastics cups for iced drinks when they ask you to stay or to go? Seems wasteful, especially when there is a simple solution.

Tip:
One hour means one hour. Verbatim note from the parking patrol who apparently take their job very seriously.  Be careful you don't get a parking ticket coming here."}
{"text":"This is it... I love coffee! Too much! I fu(kn hate starbucks and every time i'm dragged to the lowest point in existence and grovel at the coffee god's and give in to there powers and have a starbuck's coffee only because i am in an airport i am quickly reminded of why american consumerism taste like burnt toast from old tires on your grand dad's dentures (whatever that means) anyways the coffee angel's have been conspiring in my corner and every time i visit my earthly father in Arizona a bit of heaven forms in the magic we humans call coffee. Cartel kills it!!! Their espresso is socks and pant dropping, the frothy emotional appeal from the crema is enough to make a 14 year old boy have his first... And the finish dances a nutty smooth magic down the back of the tongue with the perfect amount of bitter and sweet on the sides and front. Onto the coffee, shit$ ill wit it g'unit! Great selection, choices on prep from chemix to clever to aero to hario to magic unicorns of cafe en tu boca!! And they have the option to serve everything in ceramic because lets be honest, if your as fukin gangster coffee drinker like me you don't mess with paper. Save trees beaches! Also If you like double mocha caramel frappa dappa doo da chinos with vanilla chocolate doo doo drippings, fear not!! Theres starbucks all over this airport;-) Ok and here is the best part: the employees!! Imagine smooth butter meets fresh blackberry and mango preserved atop honey agave dripping goodness of love magic... Thats the flavor of customer service! But on the real real they are beyond knowledgable and so open and nice about their mad skills. I know a litl about coffee so it's nice to pretend that i'm a wizard and then ask questions and still get a smile and some love from the original ganstarista's at Cartel. They were even out of bagged beans for sale and made a custom one for me and still gave me a free cup with it! ONE LOVE, ONE MIC, ONE PULL, ONE ESPRESSO TO RULE THEM ALL haha but ya its pretty good, thanks guys Nicholas and then two other good looking peeps (beautiful girl with tattoo of lotus, dark hair of the elvish maybe a direct descendent of liv tylers character in lord of the rings, and then a handsome young lad with dirty blonde ruffled hair of the gypsies and David Hasselhof from his early years in baywatch) who's name i didn't get but energies were appreciated!! for my delicious boost so i could write this radically long and super informative but serious review. Peace to the middle east~~~"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere of this place - it's pretty laid back, they have a mix of seating types and seem to have enough outlets for everyone. I also like that they have the usual coffee fare as well as a bar.

The teas that I've tried taste good, but it's hard to drink because they leave all of the tea in the glass when they serve it to you, so it gets stuck on your lips/ face/ teeth. Kind of weird. I haven't tried the coffee yet but am looking forward to it."}
{"text":"A great reprieve from the normal coffee production systems in our airports and towns. Great coffee/expresso/latte's etc, good selection of pressed juices and pastries that are far superior to what you have to put up with in Starbucks, Peets et al."}
{"text":"I have never found another place where they roast their beans and brew their own beer!

I am not a coffee person but I could tell from everyone consuming the coffee including family members that this in house roasted coffee was very good. The coffee shop has a great vibe.  This isn't your corporate coffee shop in the least!  

Where they really excel in my books is that they have a small nano brewery at the back of the shop with a small tasting room lounge.  They brew multiple styles of beer including an Amber Rye, Double IPA and a Pale Ale if I remember correctly and it seems these change with the season.

If you find yourself in Tempe check this place out!"}
{"text":"How many great things can one say about the Cartel? Does Infinity work! Yes, that was a statement, not a question. I am in love with the CC, hands down. I have traded my gold Starbucks card in for this amazingly Delicious start to my day. The iced coffee ( actually, its Toddy, which is better) is amazing. They roast their own beans, and allow the iced coffee to sit over night, creating an extremely potent concoction. The hot drinks, A+++ as well. And, the food? A+++++ (5, yup its that legit). Grab the cheddar bacon muffin... its literally heaven. No joke. Heaven. Little clouds may form above your head; white clouds of course! Not those nasty rain clouds. OK, maybe not clouds. But defiantly your day will be sunny because you stopped into Coffee Cartel. And not because you live in AZ. Duh. 

Only complaint I have is the hours. I live right next door, and their only open M-F (like so many places in DT-Pho). 

PLLLEEEEAAAASSSEEEEEE open up for the weekends!!! I'll work for free! Well...wait... I'll come visit."}
{"text":"Meh.  Ordered a regular Latte and a Chai Tea Latte, both were good, I can't say that it was better than anywhere else I've tried.  However it's a really cool environment for studying or hanging out with some friends, some really good lounging areas.  The only reason I give it 3 stars was because the sizes of the drinks were REALLY tiny, like a child's size.  All in all, if I were in the area I'd probably stop by again."}
{"text":"A coffee house for the eclectic and the intellect. Great coffee, but served differently. Great space in terms of atmosphere and a place to do your work on the computer."}
{"text":"My $6.00 iced soy latte was bomb! It's coffee the way it should be; not that fake foo foo stuff we pay for at places that don't really profess to know about coffee bean origins. Here at Cartel you see the coffee beans in action. Love the ambiance at this place; it's a \"see & be seen\" type of vibe, so grab your prescription glasses, MacBook, iPhone and get ready for some of the best coffee you've ever had. Order a pour over which is made with one of the daily coffee varietals of your choice for a true taste of how this place gets down. They do coffee right. Reminds me of one of my favorite spots in Cali - Portola Coffee Lab inside the OC Mix - I love this place!"}
{"text":"I don't drink coffee, my tummy doesn't like it...well I should say it gets VERY angry when I drink even diluted coffee drinks.

The interior is trendy urban industrial, and there's a huge fan to keep their covered outside area as cool as possible (still not cool in AZ summer, but I appreciate the obvious effort).

I've only had two drinks here: the iced chai latte and the orange blossom beer, both of which went down quick and well.

Orange Blossom Beer is locally brewed and has a persistent orange sicle note. Yum!"}
{"text":"Cartel has an amazing atmosphere and their drinks are amazing - I am only sad that they don't have honey any more!"}
{"text":"Finally getting around to trying this place as it has such high reviews and also was highly recommended by my barista/coffee snob sister.

Yes, I enjoyed my vanilla latte very much. Their espresso is excellent. I also had the coffee cake which was fresh and delicious. I also thought the decor was unique and interesting. Their espresso machine is a work of art in and of itself!

Things I wasn't thrilled about...if you're not a hipster or student you will feel out of place (because you are!). I walked in with my 2 year old son and felt like people were throwing daggers at me with their eyes. I also didn't appreciate the pretentious barista who seemed dead set on letting me know just how ignorant I was about coffee. They also don't post their prices which I thought was super annoying.

So basically I would give them 5 stars for their espresso, baked goods , and atmosphere. 0-1 for the customer service and I land at a 3 stars."}

Being from LA I crave real coffee when traveling. 

While I appreciate the notion of great espresso in an airport, the hype was too built up. 

Vibe and baristas were very friendly, and the food offering has healthy options (much appreciated!). 

Thank you for providing almond milk! Cappuccino was not as bold, too acidic, and not as flavorful as expected. 

A great alternative to Starbucks/Peets, but I'm comparing it to stand alone coffee joints. 

Meh."}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee Lab and barista Ryan at Sky Harbor International is a credit to the company. I had a few minutes and was feeling a need for a cup of coffee. Ryan was cheerful and eager. More importantly he was friendly. Ryan could have just pressed the vacuum pot for my large cup of coffee, but he instead educated me on a \"pour over\".   I asked him for his favorite coffee and he suggested a \" El Volcan\" from the hills of El Salvador. He mentioned the coffee was full-bodied and had a sweet, spicy aftertaste.
Now how cool is it to get a fresh, single-cup of coffee!?
By far the most fun I have had at any coffee shop anywhere. I will also note that both baristas worked very well together in the small shop. All the customers were treated very well. I hope to have another Southwest layover in Phoenix 'cause I will return.
Hearty recommendation here. Walk past the places that serve up burnt up beans and have a \"pour over\" at Cartel Coffee Lab!"}
{"text":"I still like Lux better. Cartel is very appealing, though, to those who know their coffee. The menu is not huge, but it does offer basic, good drinks. 
They have plenty of syrups to flavor your drinks, if that's what you're into.
I like the atmosphere in there, and the bike wheel \"art\" is pretty interesting and unique.
This place is probably really great to study in, considering the fact that I see a sea of macbook apples every time I walk in here. 
The employees are funny and nice. Anyway, it is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I can't say that I'm impressed by this coffee shop's attitude nor their roasting ability. Back when they first opened in Tempe it was a totally different experience. I used to get Cartel Coffee whole beans regularly, but then I moved away for a period of time. I thought I'd give them a try again as they used to roast pretty good coffee. Well times have changed and they seem to be under the impression that under roasting coffee is a good thing. I purchased 2 12oz bags of beans at $19 for 12oz thinking it was a full 16oz. I guess 12oz is because they are \"ultra premium\". I took the coffee home and made espresso. The beans gave off a good aroma as it brewed, but the flavor was terrible. Overly sour and acidic in a bad way. The beans were under roasted and also had an inconsistent roast. some beans were almost a light tan color while others were a deeper tan, but none were a full roast. I contacted the shop thru yelp prior to making this review and the owner responded with a diatribe on how I just didn't understand how coffee is made and they'd be happy to educate me the next time I was in. I was told that things I disliked were actually positives. Over all I was treated like I was stupid for even suggesting there was something wrong with their coffee. Not a positive experience and I won't go back. I'd recommend Coffee Rush for a much better customer experience."}
{"text":"Awesome little coffee shop with a great laid back and unique vibe. They have some of the best cold brew and I love that you can buy a growler of it to take home."}
{"text":"Cartel is an excellent, locally-owned coffee roaster and coffee shop. They've also recently added beer to the mix.

I always buy coffee beans from Cartel to make my coffee at home. I also often get a drink at Cartel, but to be honest the brewing can be hit or miss depending on who's on the bar. Sad but true. Maybe a little more training and care is in order. I often end up with a very medicinal-tasting drink if I order in.

As an ex-barista myself, I really like that the workers are not required to wear uniforms. I respect a boss who is secure enough in their brand to let the workers present themselves. 

Major peeve: WHY are the pastries always sitting uncovered on the counter? This is gross and it dries them out. I can't believe it's even legal. There isn't even a sneeze guard. 

I'm glad they expanded the space, but it's still constantly crowded."}
{"text":"Good coffee. Girls who used to work there was very unpleasant, and a horrible barista."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Cartel for a few years now, discovering their coffee and beer on a previous trip to Arizona. I'm not sure if they make beer anymore, but their coffee shop looks to have blown up. Was it always this big and I just missed it? I swear it was smaller last time I was in town.

So I came back here twice in two days for their drip coffee. It's the most expensive drip I've purchased, something like $3.75 for a 16 ounce cup, but boy is it good. Perhaps some of the best drip coffee I've had, except for San Diego's James Coffee. Cartel doesn't have stevia, which is disappointing, but they have all the other staples for customizing your coffee.

I'm glad I don't live in Tempe as this would be an expensive habit! Next time I'm in town I'm totally picking up a bag of beans, though!"}
{"text":"Their coffee will get you woken up REAL QUICK

Great place to meet friends! Or do some homework, internet browsing, if thats your thing. I used to go here to have a beer/coffee and download music.

Be careful where you park in their lot because there are some parking spaces limited to 1-hr only but some do not have this time limitation imposed

Will return"}
{"text":"If you can stand the strong hipster vibe, this is a very solid place for the fresh roasted coffee lover. Yeah they have decent espresso drinks, but your ol cup o joe is where it's at. At home, I use a v60 and don't mind indulging in some good, fresh-roasted coffee, and this happens to be one of the closest locations in the east valley you can get it at. If you're in the shop, you can choose your beans and method of brew (aeropress, v60 and chemex). If you're unsure of choice, the barista is always happy to answer questions.

As far as a place to spend long hours of work or study, probably not the best due to the huge flux of ASU students, minimal outlets and terrible parking. But in the end, this shop stands out for me because it's huge, a great place to hang out where everyone can enjoy a drink - coffee or beer (they also have a variety of beer on top) and my favorite roaster in the valley."}

{"text":"My husband snuck over here to grab a cup of coffee while we waited on our flight in the cushy chairs next door at a taco shop. (Things you can only get away with in an airport). He got a simple latte and it was pretty decent. This is a local coffee chain. They take their time with their product. My husband observed them making the espresso and it was almost like somebody setting up for a science experiment the way they meticulously prepared to pull the shot. They even put a pretty little design on the top of the latte which only takes a moment but is definitely appreciated. I would definitely stop here the next time I'm in the Southwest terminal area."}
{"text":"I go to the Tempe location often since I'm usually at Cowtown or Casey's right around the corner, and it's a great place to run in and grab a drink or sit for a while and chat.  I met a friend there not too long ago who, surrounded by $900 bikes and dozens of Mac books reflecting in Ray Bans, proclaimed that she was \"not cool enough\" to be there.  However, after a while of smelling the freshly brewed coffee and taking in the unique art, she changed her mind.

Try the dirty whore.  It's a house-made horchata with a shot of espresso.  YEEEEES."}
{"text":"Simply wonderful to find pour overs and a real espresso machine with real baristas and amazing beans. I was kind of in shock...

My latte was very good, though there could have been more attention to the milk pour- it was a little sloppy. My travel companion had some lovely latte art in his a short while later though. The Morning Glory gluten free muffin was excellent. Go, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"How many times does it take to remember an order?

I ordered a decaf iced latte, and handed my card to the employee. He put my credit card in the chip reader and then walked off and didn't come back so I had to reach over and grab my card out of the chip reader. 

One minute later, he hollers over the counter, what did you order again? So I said, \"A decaf iced latte.\" Then he nodded and went back to supposidly make my coffee. Nope, he comes back and says, I forgot again, what did you want? - \"A decaf iced latte.\"

Thought that was the end but nope, he asked one more time if I wanted decaf or regular. 
(If you can't remember, I always find it helpful to write it down.)

Let's just say that I finally got my drink but it wasn't good anymore because I had a horrible taste in my mouth after that whole ordeal."}
{"text":"I hang out here on a regular basis (at least 2 days a week, sometime 3-4). Their coffee is great and the staff is friendly. The atmosphere is inviting and the constantly changing artwork they display adds a nice touch. 

They would get 5 stars if their wifi connection wasn't so finicky. Wifi to a coffee shop is like the air in our lungs. It's a shame that they haven't added some simple monitoring tools that can easily throttle bandwidth hoggers or get things right to make a reliable wireless network. If you can't manage your network setup yourself, hire a professional that will do it right."}
{"text":"Interesting little place! A hole in the wall of sorts. The employees were friendly and chatty, very willing to help. Quite knowledgeable about coffee which was fun to listen to. The order taker suggested the Cobb salad which I got. He mentioned that the dressing was his and it was award winning so I assume he is the owner (he wasn't cooking). Salad did not disappoint!!! So savory with the fried egg and the dressing was light. Havarti inside was exceptional as well. Salad did have more pepper than I prefer. Cappuccino was flavorful but a tad bitter. Regardless, I will be back."}
{"text":"I really like this place - but more for the food rather than beverages - though if you want a jolt of caffeine that will leave you as wired as a cyborg plugged into a 220 outlet, I can vouch the cold brew coffee is just the thing.

I can't yet vouch for the gluten-free organicky bakery goods which I haven't tried  but the carne asada chicken protein wrap or bowl and the terriyaki chicken bowl are absolutely exceptional and both less than $10 with tax.  Both these and other offerings from the \"protein menu\" are available as wrap or bowl. The wraps are absolutely enormous, of original Chipoodle proportions, and the bowl version is a vast, almost overwhelmingly generous serving of tender, moist meat, perfectly cooked (or steamed?) carrot, broccoli, cauliflower, and I don't know what other vegetables, and brown rice or quinoa in a savory sauce that is neither overwhelming nor dull.  It's a limited food menu but that just makes the choices a little easier and given the taste and apparent quality (and quantity) of my first 3 meals here, I'm looking forward to trying everything on the menu, including some rather pricey but I'd guess maniacally healthy smoothies.   

The place is a blend of modern minimalism and warmer, more welcoming reclaimed wood.  The establishment, the staff, and the background music are all  young and hip, neither of which am I, but staff is friendly and I've I've always been made to feel welcome, and the music is indeed sufficiently \"background\"
that you don't have to yell to place your order and you can still think while you eat - or you can just eat.  

I hear some people go to Cartel just for the coffee; they're missing out. 

Note limited hours at this downtown Phoenix location of 7 a.m. to 4 p.m."}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee Lab Old Town Scottsdale is a quaint little hipster coffee shop in the north side of the 5th Ave. Shop district of downtown Scottsdale. The place was clean and quiet, with ample seating as well as a shared courtyard patio to the west. For all of the time it had been there, I had never known, since it gets hidden in the location.

The staff was very friendly. The service was fast, and I had my beverage and muffin in no time at all. I'm torn about the whole get your own lid thing, since my drink was full to the top and it was awkward juggling my stuff, the drink and the lid and straw. Eventually I got myself coordinated.

I ordered a blueberry muffin and a large iced chai.  The 16oz. Chai was underwhelming at a whopping 5 bucks! (even overpriced Starbucks has the Grande, 16oz. At $3.65) The muffin was tasty, with nice crusty sugar on top. A bit dry, but still pleasant.

I don't know that I would spend the money for a substandard chai in the future.  While I like to support local businesses and avoid the Starbucks monster, I think I will keep looking for that right place."}
{"text":"Great coffee and other drinks at a premium price and tiny sizes. Typical \"hipster\" vibe with the reclaimed garbage art, bicycle wheel fixtures, and a general hand made look and feel. Service is a hit or miss. Some of the employees are sweet and helpful, others seem to look down upon you like they are some sort of Coffee bean royalty. 
Slightly overrated but the drinks, and that's what's important, are really great! I love their chai tea. They just need to work on the generally trendy aura that's given off the second you walk in and lower the prices slightly, or up the sizes a bit, either or."}
{"text":"I see what the hype is about cool place with good service, great coffee and chill vibe. I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"i needed a hip place to put together a study group at and everyone in that study group to think i was hella cool as a result. close to campus and totally a gem for those that don't know or haven't been. nice study area towards the back with the garage door open to allow for natural, eco-friendly air circulation.

the line gets backed up pretty bad because they only have like one or two people working there. and everyone in there knows those people, so they get to chatting instead of pouring my americano. and questioning my capability to handle a large (4 shot) americano. i'm a fucking college student, you could probably cut my coffee with cocaine and i wouldn't notice the difference.  

a large americano was $3 and tasted like pure espresso bean bliss. i put cream in it, but really, it didn't need anything. it was perfect in all of its cartel special bean ways. my friend got a soy vanilla latte which i tried and it was perfectly balanced. usually there is either too much soy, or too much vanilla, but the cartel coffee crew knows how to correctly mix and pour coffee and additives.  

while service may not be there strong point, cartel keeps the doors open by serving the best espresso in town with the most urban vibe inside."}
{"text":"The coffee is great and the atmosphere is very arty and open. I do like working from the back with the large bench seats and open room. It really does make the energy there more collaborative and connected. It is also nice to see exactly where the coffee is roasted and the entire process happens there too! Pretty cool place to spend a morning or afternoon."}
{"text":"First time here based on Yelpers and was truly disappointed. The cold brew was too acidic and tastes like old coffee. They can't make ice macchiato, which was kind of shocking. The atmosphere is cool with a nice vibe. The decor is unique and cool. As for service, it was pleasant, nothing too exceptional. Sadly, I will not come back. Moving on to find a better coffee place while in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I don't see the hype. It seems like a hipster hangout.There is no carmel macchiato.The services was not top notch.wasted 6 bucks.......its a shame"}
{"text":"Hipster central. Cartel gets packed with students \"studying\" and bloggers on their laptops all day everyday. I'm sure people can get a lot of work done here, but I can't. Too many opportunities to people watch! I usually get an iced toddy or a one-and-one. I try and sit at the bar so I can get a full view/earful of what everyone is up to. Never a dull moment!"}
{"text":"They apparently don't carry hazelnut or caramel syrup which I feel is absurd because those are the most basic flavored. I settled for a hot vanilla latte \"for here\". Got an iced latte to go instead. Decided not to say anything and try it instead, it was extremely subpar. Parking limit here is an hour and a half so not an ideal place to get caught up on homework. Does not live up to the hype, regret not making the drive to Lux."}
{"text":"I found this place while on vacation and it turns out it's a favorite for locals. Thank you yelp! Anyways, I always have trouble ordering coffee because I don't like it too bitter and the cashier helped me find a sweet drink that was awesome. I've never seen a cold toddy on a menu before and it was great to try one. The customer service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm from NYC/NJ area, and addicted to good espresso.
I'd found this place while I'm transferring my flight to Las Vegas.
The place looks hip and cool, so I had to try their espresso.

Taste so GOOD, and it was so smooth with full aromatic flavor.
Thus, I had to come back on my way back.

I came back for quality espresso for myself, so I highly recommend to y'all."}
{"text":"When I first came to this place I was kinda surprised seeing those antelope heads on the wall. Although it kinda freaked me out a little in the beginning, it wasn't all that bad. Pretty nice actually. Place is neat and atmosphere is good too. Had a latte and breakfast burrito and it was really good. Their tea is also something. I really like this place alot."}
{"text":"Astonishing coffee paired with different kinds of cake depending on your taste budge. I have tried this place couple of times and my favorite cake to order is the banana loaf cake. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Cartel is a coffee world unto itself for downtown Tempe, which is void of many non-alcoholic places to hang out.  Situated in what seems to be a motel from the outside and a garage on the inside, Cartel can satiate your brass tax coffee fix and your espresso lust for reasonable prices.  

The coffee is great.  Period.  They roast the beans themselves, know way too much about coffee and are proud.  The espresso, in whatever form you get it in, is rich and nutty.  The toddy (cold brewed iced coffee) is strong to the point of me jittering out the door from a small one.  The teas are various and steeped in a cool manner and timed according to their type.  The vibe can come off a little pretentious sometimes with all their rules and such, but they are selling a great product and the rules help distinguish them from the crowd.

I like to hangout here for an hour every week or so, good people watching, the pretentious guy behind the counter is good to listen to if you want to hear people getting so-so advice that they didn't ask for and my professors come here so it is a good place to catch them not in work mode.

My only complaint is that they need to find a way to get a bike rack closer to the door.  My only other complaint is that they could have more snacks available, I would love to dip something baked in their coffee."}
{"text":"If you are someone who likes good coffee, and enjoy the trendy hipster atmosphere, Cartel Coffee is the best place in the Phoenix area. Their big store off Mill and University smells of roasting coffee beans, they have baristas that are truly artists of coffee making. 

They have some of the best espresso I have ever had, and I have never had a bad customer service experience. They aren't over the top friendly like those Brothers from Amsterdam (hint, hint)  but if the coffee isn't to my liking they have always fixed it without giving me any grief or the typical eye roll. Whenever I have a friend or business colleague that knows their coffee, I always bring them to Cartel. 

The atmosphere is very welcoming at all of their locations. Each store has a specific unique theme to it,  which gives each store their own personality. To me, this is the best coffee in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This Wi-Fi cafe is a popular local hangout with a large and spacious interior and lots of outlets for laptops. The vibe is hipsterish with a local following, and the norms include busy foot traffic and people socializing and studying at every turn. They usually roast their beans in the middle of the day, so the deep coffee aroma can be very enticing before you step inside. I'm usually here with my laptop, and the convenience of parking in the back has allowed me to come here for casual and important meetings.

I had a small cup of Pilar ($4) that came from Guatemala with a crisp and airy consistency but a little bitter, chalky, and heavy on the finish. The added soymilk did not dissolve easily, prompting me to wish that they had handcrafted along with the pour over. The price was higher than Blue Bottle or Philz, so naturally I had to expect more from this drip.

I also tried a large cup of Soy Latte ($5) with Borbollon, a Salvadoran bean that tasted smooth, silky, complex, and easy at the finish. The soy consistency was creamy and not watery like some other places. I prefer the Latte than the pour over.

Service was friendly, responsive, and fairly consistent on every visit. Despite its popularity, their quality still a step behind some of the better handcrafted coffee places. A good place for studying and Yelping, I hope to eventually check out their downtown location."}
{"text":"This was the worst coffee I've ever had, I could've made a better cup in a motel 6 room. It wasn't hot, and very bitter. Ordered 2 different things, a latte and a mocha, both were gross. The sign said \"best coffee in Phoenix\" more like \"worst coffee in the US.\""}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere for a cup of coffee and light conversation or to get some work done. They have a seating area for about 30 inside and another area between their suite and another for about 15 or so people.

This is a spin off from their Tempe location that keeps expanding and is a huge hit by the campus."}
{"text":"Usually love this place.   But I'm now almost 30 minutes into waiting for my cappuccino.  Saw them pour my milk 10 minutes ago which means warm when frothing.     Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Can't stand Southwest or Terminal 4.  The only saving grace is Cartel.  Regular at 5th Avenue but the coffee at the airport is great too."}
{"text":"Oh Cartel. I've had quite the love affair with their iced agave latte ever since a friend of mine introduced it to me. It's always been a great place to go and work when you need to get out of the office, I feel like everytime I'm there I see a few people I know. If you haven't tried this place definitely give it a shot. I know I'll miss it."}
{"text":"Coffee pretty good- not giving it 5 stars as the lack of outlets was kind of annoying and the chairs not so comfortable- a studenty hang out and not that clean . Friendly enough though"}
{"text":"Love this place. Coffee is great, and staff is friendly and fun. Careful though--if you're running short on time, this isn't the quick grab-and-go coffee stop. They make your drinks with love, and that takes a few extra minutes. Also have great pastries!"}
{"text":"Love their Lattes! The yogurt/fruit/granola parfait a healthy and filling snack. The no paper receipt,. but we will e-mail or text you....a BIG Fail! Not only did I not get an E-mail receipt for my company expense report but my E-mail request authored on their website asking for one was also ignored!

I love the coffee, but don't go to a paperless receipt system until you can support it properly!

I will probably try the Cartel again, but will not leave the facility until I receive the receipt in some manner!"}

{"text":"Traveling can make you thirsty and coffee isn't a thirst quencher, but its a delicious treat . I found cartel coffee lab while driving through Scottsdale. The latte is outstanding it has an undertone of caramel. If your ever in Scottsdale treat yourself to a fantastic coffe with very eclectic people."}
{"text":"I am on a coffee tour of Phoenix and the surrounding areas.  My drink of choice is the iced mocha and theirs is delicious.  The perfect blend of coffee and sweet.  I had the small and it hot the spot. The atmosphere is a cool, industrial look and it had plenty of seating and wasn't too loud to do a little reading. I recommend!"}
{"text":"If I were judging this place on their coffee alone, it would receive 5 stars. They're one of the few places in Phoenix (third-wave coffee shops) who source, roast and brew their beans well.

But I am judging it on grounds of environment (2/5 stars) and coffee (5/5 stars).

That being said, the environment is lacking. There are nearly no comfortable places to sit. Very few outlets for laptop charging. Slightly annoying music, and a continuous chatter of deep-voiced businessmen and women (at least when I visit, around 9 or 10 am). Maybe it's just me, but I really enjoy having a comfy bench or couch to do my homework on.

Simply put: If I'm looking to grab a cup of coffee and go, or to chat with someone over a cup of coffee, then Cartel is great. If I'm looking to hole up and focus on homework for a while, I'll probably go somewhere else.

Coffee suggestion: Try the One & One. A shot of espresso and a (correctly made) macchiatto (a shot of espresso with a bit of foam.)

UPDATE: Their rating has moved up to 4 stars, from 3. They got cushions for their hard concrete seats, and the music has improved greatly."}
{"text":"Very good coffee. Surprised given the airport location. Could have used a bigger one but very smooth slight berry overtones. Had a small americano $3.50"}
{"text":"Hipster heaven. Bring on the 1920s era boots with dungarees to match. 

Really cool space. A terrific, vintage roaster is prominently displayed and obviously used. 

There is clearly a craft coffee shortage in my hometown. A line was nearly out the door. 

I scored an espresso. It was served up effectively and efficiently. In my humble opinion, the coffee was good...not great. A little too much fruit/acid. Not enough chocolatey smoothness. But, that's my taste. Not necessarily everyone else's cup o' tea!

However, my girl ordered a pour-over. And, pour-overs take a while. But, after ten minutes of waiting, we asked. Oh! We forgot about your pour-over coffee! Just wait another ten minutes. Derrrr...I don't want to wait another ten but I guess I have to cuz my girl is a caffeine junkie and so am I. Can't function without the wonderful stuff. 

I got to taste my girls cup o' joe and it was delicious. 

All in all, they have a good thing going but need to tweak a couple of things. I would return."}
{"text":"4/5 favorite part of the airport

i fondly remember finding the downtown location on a long walk from the office i used to work from when i was in consulting - it was like oh whoa! and then suddenly there it was in my terminal.

it's an efficient operation, and i'm thankful that in between the stress of traveling i can get great caffeinated beverage. on a recent visit, i also opted for a bag of beans as i knew i was running low, and if you grab a bag they cover your coffee for free! the sandwiches are tasty, but definitely also airport priced."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee. Seriously a pain in the ass to get. So many hipsters and laptop jockeys that my bf and I couldn't find an open seat at 2 on a Sunday afternoon. So yeah, coffee is really delicious but not sure it's worth the trouble."}
{"text":"If you've ever wished that an airport would have a great local coffee joint- this is the place you were hoping for. Tremendous cold brew. The location downtown is great as well. Never had an unsatisfactory coffee here."}
{"text":"There's nothing I love more than a cozy coffee shop. In Saint Louis, you can toss a quarter and hit a coffee shop, here however, it's a little more sparse....maybe a handful of quarters and you can hit a Starbucks. There's nothing wrong with Starbucks, as the owner of Cartel Coffee told us, \"there's a time for Starbucks and there's a time for a fresh, good pour\". I like her. I like this place. It works. 

    The decor is bare bones, industrial-esque and I love it. Two chaises by the front windows are good for lounging and beyond that, there are wooden tables, replica wooden stumps, and some outside patio seating on the side as well. It's simple, it's down to earth, and you can get a damn good cup of coffee. Their dirty chai is wonderful, the fresh pours are delicious and truthfully, the pastries I've been eying are getting harder and harder to resist. They also have a variety of beers and wines to pick from if you're working from home, grading some papers or just really need that end of the day drink. 

   They've been featured by BBC Travel and Food and Wine Magazine which means, maybe I'm not the only one who thinks this place is a freakin' gem in Scottsdale. I wish there were even more coffee spots like this, but I can't deny my affections for Cartel. Don't miss out on a great cup of coffee and a perfect opportunity to people watch!"}
{"text":"The mocha here is delicious! It was one of the best mochas I've ever had. It wasn't overly chocolatey & it had a unique aftertaste. I also tried the cold brew & aero pressed coffee (with Maravilla coffee from Guatemala). Both were very good. The shop's unique because there's a side outdoor area with seats and lounge furniture & also a backroom where people predominantly study. I like the segregation of the dining spaces because it allows for people who want to talk be separated from people who want to read/study. A bag of beans here costs around $19. They serve pour over and chemex coffee as well. They also seem to serve some alcohol."}
{"text":"Came here to visit the wife's ASU alma mater and wound up in Cartel. It's a roasting facility as well and offers a wide variety of flavors for the experienced coffee snob. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times before but just grabbed a coffee to meet up with someone. Today I decided to try working remotely here from my laptop and was disappointed in numerous things....First of all there was jelly and crumbs on the table where I wanted to setup so I grabbed a napkin and cleaned it off myself. No biggy, maybe they had a busy breakfast and hadn't gotten to cleaning yet. So I setup and noticed there were no power outlets near any of the tables so I had to move to the bench area with no table as that was the only power outlet I saw. There was still a few plates and cups left from the previous customers but I just moved them down a bit and got to working. An hour passes and the girls behind the counter have been so loud laughing and talking about snapchat to each other that they haven't even come out from behind the counter to clean any of the tables or the mess that has been sitting for who knows how long now. They can't be too busy at this point because I am 1 of 4 patrons in the whole place but it is almost lunch time and you would think they would want to get the place clean and ready for the new customers. Finally the barista comes over and cleans all of the empty plates and cups but doesn't actually wipe any of the space down. The wifi cut out at least 3 times while I was working so there really is no reason for me to go back to this place. There are other coffee shops in the area that have comparable coffee, better service and accommodate guests wanting to work from their laptops."}
{"text":"Funky and has culture but scales to airport level too.  I've no clue how they do that but if I didn't have an open mind I would have assumed anything airport isn't worth pursuit.  Glad I transcended but b forewarned, if driving the parking is limited."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick after-lunch coffee. I thought I'd been to Cartel (a different location) before but I couldn't find my review... anyway, it was decent, but I'm not seeing the hype. 
I got a macchiato - espresso with steamed milk - and it came in a TINY little tea cup. When I ordered, the cashier said they only make it \"traditional\" and I had no idea why he said that to me like I didn't know what I was ordering... I'm sure they get a lot of people in that expect the crème-laden chocolate monstrosity that Starbucks will give you if you ordered a mocha macchiato there. However, I hated that he presumed I had no clue what I wanted. With it, I got a chocolate chip cookie - which was larger than your average cookie and undercooked to perfection - but not really worth the price tag.

The cookie was $3 (yikes) and the espresso $3. Mom's mocha was another $3.  

Now, I appreciate that they roast their own coffees here so you get a wholly unique flavour but my espresso was really bitter. Like, medicine bitter. I like a super strong roast flavour but I want it to also be smooth and flavourful. This was neither. Mom agreed about her mocha. 

3 stars for effort, environment (the window paintings were awesome and plenty of comfortable seating) and a great cookie but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Just tried my first ever pour over, created by the very knowledgable and helpful Jesse who was happy to teach this wannabe connoisseur more about his craft. I was certainly not disappointed by the rich, but mild notes this method produces. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious coffee.  I ordered a cappuccino and it was splendid.  Definitely woke me which is what I like.  Also,  very reasonably priced.  The whole beer and coffee was a little confusing but you do you cartel. Pretty nice it brews it's own beers and roasts its own coffee."}
{"text":"First time visit.  I enjoyed my Chai.  Nice atmosphere.  I think prices are a bit high when compared to Starbucks and other similar places like Dutch Bros."}
{"text":"I hope that Cartel sticks it out to make a lasting impression in dtphx.  There new larger space is nice, but they need to focus on making the staff friendly and knowledgeable of the area.  The coffee speaks for itself - amazing.. The atmosphere - cool.  I like that you will find the ultimate of hipster sitting next to a dressed to the nines lawyer.  I only hope they continue to pump out great coffee and just work to make the staff a bit more friendly."}
{"text":"Love this shop. The location is wonderful and the atmosphere is very charming. Love all the drinks and the friendly employees. Also really like how their is separate seating if you need a quieter area. Their lattes and brewed teas are my favorite!"}
{"text":"OMG... Best coffee ever! Drinking a \"Mullet\" made by Mr. Mullet himself! Sooo good! Please open up a lab in NorCal!!!!"}
{"text":"I am not a hipster, and this place is full of them...  However, if you like good, black, drip coffee, there is no place better than this.  They have a lot of choices, and they have new ones to try all the time.  I'm not much of an espresso drinker, I've never once ordered an espresso drink from them.  Good drip coffee is something hard to find.  Expect to spend at least 10-15 minutes in there, they use things like the V60 or the aeropress to brew their coffee when you order it.  The iced toddy is great too."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop with unbelievable varieties for Phoenix.  Latte was supreme.  A little confusing with two shops in one space, pay for food at another register.  Overall very happy I found this place on a brisk morning downtown."}
{"text":"They have my heart with their cappuccino (not to mention the guy made a heart on top of it!!). Great decoration and a place to hang around with a good conversation, book and a tasty, aromatic cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"Stop here and get a delicious cup of coffee or espresso drink, then grab some beans for home to improve your mornings wherever your destination. I picked up a couple pounds of perfectly roasted whole beans here to bring with me while visiting family in Florida. Thank you Cartel Coffee Lab for sparing me 2 weeks of insufferable dunkin doughnuts coffee while stuck on the gulf coast."}
{"text":"Sorry to disappoint the 4 and 5 star reviewers here but having had the Cartel coffee and espresso I must say that coffee drinking is all about taste, not production of it. I'm glad to see that Cartel promotes its principles and passion but its taste leaves some desiring a good cup of coffee or espresso. To me, all I've tried at Cartel tasted sour and bitter at the same time. Now, I'm not a friend of the over-roasted coffee at *$s but I always crave a cup of good coffee when I'm on the run. And this one ain't it. Time to try other Mom-n-Pop coffee shops around."}
{"text":"Nestled in the C gates area at Sky Harbor's terminal 4, this place is worth checking out, even if you had to walk from A (as I did). It's a small space, but packed with the goods, including whole beans, food, and the full array of coffee drinks you'd expect. 

I selected a latte to drink and a cookie to eat at the provided stools and tables, and a couple of bags of beans to go. The latte was creamy and very mild, maintaining a distinctly strong coffee note while also being free of any bitterness. It was positively delicious. The peanut butter cookie was fresh, big and delicious, with a good crumb and a deep, rich peanut butter taste. 

After getting back home, I dug into the beans. My selections were Las Galeras from Colombia (promising \"red grape and cocoa, with a long finish\") and San Agustin from El Salvador (touting \"effervescent blackberry compote and vanilla\"). Both were very good examples of their respective countries' products; the Colombian tended to be a little strong with a noticeable, but not overbearing, acidity, where as the El Salvadoran was very smooth and mild, with the vanilla notes definitely showing through. The latter, in particular, was an incredible pour from my French press. 

This place is definitely worth a try, and they're right there at the airport. Your Fitbit will love you for taking the walk, and you taste buds will love you for drinking the coffee!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Wait time is at least 15 min for only two simple iced lattes. I like to try different coffee places other than Starbucks and I have never had an Iced Vanilla Latte taste \"sour\" not impressed. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found you! I felt like I was on vacation while I was hanging out there, it was such a nice change from all the corporate coffee places. 

Really cool space, friendly owner and wonderful cappuccino.

Thanks Cartel and Yelp!"}
{"text":"Pros: Good Coffee at an airport. 
Cons: Not a lot of places to sit. 

When I saw that the phoenix airport had a \"quality\" coffeeshop- I was very dubious about its quality. I was pleasantly surprised by Cartel Coffee Lab. They have unique coffee as well as various espresso drinks including one&one which was explained to me as a shot of their espresso and a macchiato. Unfortunately that was only available for \"for here\" and when I was ordering, there were no open spots to sit at. Therefore, I ordered a 12 ounce Lamari. It was a pour over coffee that met all  expectations. It took about 5 minutes to make. The flavor notes were \"Plum and cane sugar with a long aftertaste\"- it definitely was a relatively sweet coffee and it was extraordinary smooth. I did not even feel the need to add cream or sugar to the drink. 
Ironically, once I finally got my drink, a lot of seats had opened up so I enjoyed my coffee there. After finishing my drink- I decided to buy a bag of their coffee beans. They only had 12 ounce packages and not all coffee beans were offered. I chose the honey processed beans as it seemed like a very interesting concept. When buying, they actually offered me a free Cold Brew. I took it with me to drink on the plane and again, the cold brew met all expectations. If I find myself again in the Phoenix airport I will definitely come to gate C11 for a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I'm not downtown often so when I was in the area for a workshop I was excited to check out the 1st Street Cartel location. Didn't have a lot of time to enjoy the atmosphere but it was an interesting place. The guy working the coffee bar was excellent, friendly and made a flavorful cup of coffee with the V60. Their wifi was on the fritz so the payment system was down. The barista apologized and gave me the coffee on the house. Wish I lived closer to this location as it was an excellent experience and the coffee lived up to the reputation."}
{"text":"Hands down the best cold brew I've ever had. It was so incredibly smooth and flavorful that it begs to be enjoyed without the adulteration of creamer or sweetener. I'm going back for another one in about 15 minutes, and I will try to get one more before hitting the road for LA this afternoon."}
{"text":"I would say that the barista girl is not friendly at all! The cashier is super friendly! Thus, I have mixed feelings about this place in regards to customer service. Overall, it is a super chill. It's a perfect spot to do some research on your phone for hours. 

I ordered their herbal tea and their strawberry pop tart. The herbal tea is laced with a subtle minty taste and feel which I really enjoy. Their pop tart does not come warm. This makes it a bit stale. But, the flavors of the pop tart are good. It's not too sweet. I was hoping it would be a bit sweeter (my dang sweet tooth...) However, for those who don't enjoy super sweet pastries it's a great option for you."}
{"text":"A cozy, hidden, low-key coffee spot tucked away right in the heart of downtown Tempe. I love their chai tea and espresso; they always provide that perfect coffee burst for those long afternoons! Seating is quite limited, as the tables and benches tend to fill up rather quickly. Throughout the several decades I have spent growing up in Tempe, the Cartel lab still remains as one of my most beloved local coffee shops. Cartel has always remained loyal and true to it's roots, although their menu has changed they have not sacrificed any quality whatsoever. In comparison to other local coffee shops, I would definitely recommend Cartel. This truly is a hole in the wall gem.

Afternoon idea: 
Stop by Cartel coffee, grab your favorite caffeinated beverage, and make a walk over to Buffalo Exchange in the same plaza for some discounted vintage shopping! ;p"}
{"text":"While I'll outright admit that I'm not a coffee guy in general, I'll also admit that I love Cartel's iced toddy, and for a man who doesn't enjoy coffee to be semi-addicted to a toddy it must speak something to the quality. The atmosphere is calm and inviting, it's nice and dim and really welcoming on warm days, and they have lots of comfy chairs and games to play if you aren't there to be productive.
   Cartel has somewhat recently opened a small brewery at this location, which of the brews I've tried have been good, not great. There has never been anything wrong with a beer I've had here, it just hasn't been killer... and if you aren't doing something new or spectacular, why do it? Cartel's chai is a wonderful and refreshing drink and while I've had a couple of misses with their pastries, most have been tasty.
   Cartel is simply an institution in Tempe at this point. And while it isn't perfect and sometimes the line is crazy, it is a great place to sit and hang or grab a nice drink for the go."}
{"text":"San Francisco style 3rd wave & hipster coffee shop approved! Holy smokes, Cartel is a gem of a coffee shop! Not only are they the best airport coffee shop I've ever encountered but they're up there with the best of the best coffee shops period! Simple menu, fresh & home baked pastries, and enough coffee options to satisfy the most of the coffee snob. Brew options include Chemex, Aeropress, V60 pour over, French press, and clever. Espresso is pulled on a high quality LA Mazaroco machine. I tried 4 coffee origin options, espresso, and cold brew on my 2 visits this week and had my socks blown off with everything!!! Thank you for such a delightful experience while flying through Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Cartel my sweet cartel! If you are ever by ASU and better yet have a bike.... bike to cartel! It's such an awesome coffee shop, super chill, with the best of the best coffee specifically chai tea. It's very hipster and very inviting. Did I say they have the best chai tea ever? 

I will say parking sucks, but if you are around the area or just taking a quick stop... go in a see for yourself."}
{"text":"Meh. Good coffee but not outstanding. It did the trick for our caffeine for the morning. The barista wasn't very helpful, we asked what flavor the scone was and she said it was unflavored and walked away before we could try to buy it."}
{"text":"Out of all the coffee places in the area that I've been to (Berdenas/Regroup/Altitude/maverick/4tilfour) this is my least favorite spot- been here twice, twice the staff is not the friendliest & kinda stuck up...coffee is my least favorite as well and almost has a sour taste to it. The pastry I got was dry but I will give them that they have a bomb pop tart. Might give it another go,3x you're out though."}
{"text":"This place is probably the best in Phoenix. Very close to Portland levels are far as taste and quality. The Barista was knocking Portland coffee while I was there so I don't feel they deserve a 5 star review."}
{"text":"If star ratings were indicative of how hipster a place is, then Coffee Cartel Lab on University is a five star.  But fortunately, the service, coffee and consumables were excellent too, so it gets a five star from this traveler for the right reasons.

An easy-to-get-to location right off University, with a slightly cramped parking lot, but at least it's free, everything about Coffee Cartel Lab is pretty, well hip.  I particularly like the word \"cartel\" in the name, because it makes me feel like the caffeine I crave is like a Venezuelan drug and the coffee cartels are the only place I can acquire it.

But the interior is a tidal wave of hipster atmosphere, with dim lights, open ceilings, independent art all over the walls, flyers and cards for independent works free to peruse and browse, and pretty much every seat in the house taken up by someone with horn-rimmed glasses, tattoos, ironic t-shirts and skinny jeans, equipped with their iPhones, iPads or laptops, making full use of the wifi.  But it's still clean and cozy feeling, overall.  Oddly, to a jaded traveler like myself, as critical as I sound towards hipsters, the places they frequent are kind of the places I like to frequent...

Anyway, the mocha I ordered was creamy and just right, and I took great sadistic pleasure in purchasing the very last cookie that was this Frankenstein of chocolate chips, peanut butter AND BACON.  The bacon flavor was subtle, but still noticeable, and I took great pleasure of enjoying it in between sips of my mocha while trying not to inadvertently listen to young ASU students trying to give each other resume tips and advice.

Prices were standard faire, and really nothing different than you would expect from a Starbucks, or any other independent coffee shop these days.  I know for a fact that my travels would bring me out to Arizona again, and if presented the opportunity, I'd go back to the Cartel again without much problem."}
{"text":"Food: Really enjoy their cold brew coffee. I have only eaten their a couple of times, but when I have the food has been quite tasty. It is prepared fresh with quality ingredients. I enjoyed their breakfast sandwich, as well as the turkey sandwich.

Atmosphere: Definitely interesting. They have mounted antelope heads on the wall and a chandelier that goes all the way to the floor. Some of the seating are poured concrete blocks that look like the floor just rose up to give you a place to sit down. 

Service: I have never had a negative experience there, and most of the time I get very friendly and courteous help. But there have been a couple times where they were slammed busy where they weren't as friendly as usual.

Location: I really like the location of this place even if it is a little further away than the Tempe or Scottsdale locations. It's right off the light rail and in the heart of downtown. Great if you have a few minutes to kill before a meeting and need a caffeine fix."}
{"text":"Best cold brew I've ever had.. and I've had a lot. Staff was really friendly. Loved the atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Awesome! 

Some of the best coffee I've ever had - they roast their own beans on site!"}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee Lab sets a high standard for an airport coffee shop, insofar as it's easily the best one I've ever been to. Plus, their coffee is better than many a non-airport coffee shop I've been to. So it's really a high standard for a coffee shop, period.

It's a funky little respite in the airport, with cold-brewed coffee, lovely delicious espresso shots, tempting baked goods, and baristas who, in their downtime, were animatedly discussing nuances of roasting coffee beans. So they know their wares here....Worth the trip even from another terminal if you have the time; you'll be so happy you stopped in, especially if you hail from a coffee paradise as I do. Little tastes of home, done better than many I've tasted at home."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the surprise of seeing what lies inside this dingy strip mall.  When you open the door you'd never expect how they've done it up inside.  It looks great!  On atmosphere alone I'd give this place at least 4 stars, it's a grunge/modern/artsy hang out...pretty cool.
The coffee on the other hand was not really my favorite.  They roast their own beans, which is awesome, but they have a different flavor that I wasn't really a fan of.  The portions are also pretty small.  All in all, I'd probably go back and try it again if I was in the area, maybe a different drink next time though.
Thanks for being unique!"}
{"text":"Ordered a cortado, it was delish. Quick service, neat atmosphere. Not much else to say here other than I wish I lived closer"}
{"text":"Not sure if my espresso is suppose to leave a heavy residue, but that's pretty filthy if you ask me. One coworker said he wouldn't serve that to his worst enemy. And to think I stepped out of line at Starbucks for this-never again."}
{"text":"I waited 16 minutes for one drink. There was no sense or urgency while the barista made drinks, and no apology for the long wait. I won't be visiting again. It's a shame because my drink was amazing and it's only a two minute walk from where I work, the customer service was just not good."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a coffee drinker so don't take my review too seriously. I arrived on a quiet Tues afternoon. All the best seats were taken so I plopped myself down at the bar area, which was pretty cool in itself. The cookies are incredible and the latte was good. No crazy art here, quiet atmosphere where people keep top themselves. I'm not much of a loner so I had my latte and got outta there but overall, very cute place."}
{"text":"Coffee shop adventures #3 
Traveled to AZ and found this awesome spot ! Must try the iced chai tea and agave nectar !! James is great \"when in Rome ... Whatever that means\""}
{"text":"I love cartel so much, but I never go to the ones outside of the airport because the employees are pretentious and I don't believe that's good customer service. However, for whatever reason, the managers at the airport cartel did a much better job at hiring and this place is a must whenever I visit the airport. The coffee is high quality and these employees are not rude. They are welcoming and kind and I believe they deserve all the best in business."}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee Lab does not disappoint. The location is kind of odd, but once you get inside you feel safe.

I ordered their latte and my sister ordered their vanilla latte. Both were good! We didn't order to go, however the baristas put our coffee in a to go cup :( I love drinking my coffee out of a real cup. Love all the fancy designs they do but oh well.

Pretty good, probably won't be back though. It wasn't THAT great but worth a try if you're around the area."}
{"text":"I come here 3-4 times a week to work and procrastinate behind my computer. I have made a few friends who also do the same. The coffee's and latte's are excellent. Plus, there is an acceptable tea selection for being a coffee house. I like seeing the roaster and hearing it. The atmosphere is industrial made by music which varies depending on who is working at the time, and the bare floor and unfinished ceiling. The steel fixtures finish off the interior whose walls are decorated with work by local artists. There is even more to come from the Tempe location as it is opening a second side that will act as a bar. Hooray!"}
{"text":"The interior is lame and \"authenticity\" themed. I bet the guy that grinds up those beans has a raging boner everyday knowing that he works at a place that \"justifies\" wearing a leather apron (made in the USA of course). All that aside the chai that I had there was the best I've ever had. I tried my friends herbal tea and that was great too. Haven't tried the coffee yet but knowing how good the tea is it would probably be amazing as well."}
{"text":"SO much friendlier than the downtown phx location. The girl barista there is just ugly to me every time I walk in. The barista here was super playful and nice. Best coffee around!"}
{"text":"Best latte ever, but the girl barista working 3/20/15 at 8am was the rudest person I've met in a while, I was having a good morning until encountering her. I went in to celebrate my Friday and she ruined it. She should go work at the DMV. She bit my head off for asking if the drink on the counter was mine. She was rude to everyone. I'll rethink this location next time."}
{"text":"Great find in Scottsdale.  Could use some more food selections, but otherwise really good espresso/coffee."}
{"text":"Hipster-y coffee in Old Town. You know I like me some tasty cappuccinos, but for some reason they wouldn't do a cappuccino to-go, that was a first... so I went with a latte. Fortunately the latte was excellent so I have no trouble forgiving them for a little coffee snobbery."}
{"text":"I love local coffee shops and Cartel is one of my favorites! Their iced lattes are 5 Star, and their baristas are always very nice -- great customer service. I am definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Visited Scottsdale for the first time last week and was looking for a nice coffee shop to stop at. I ordered a latte and also an aero press coffee. The latte tasted average. The aero press took a little longer. The worker started on other drinks before ours and had given them to customers that had ordered after us. Not that we mind but he didn't bother telling us that ours would take longer or what not. When the aero press came, it had an interesting taste, almost a sour after taste. Not sure if it was the type of coffee we chose but it wasn't really to my liking. 

Quite a hipster place, the staff too. The place is quite small. We came on a Saturday and there weren't much people at the cafe."}
{"text":"Decent coffee, awesome grunge ambiance.
Lots of students hang here so it gives it a young vibe.  
Hard to find a seat though on a Friday night. 
Good if you are already in Tempe- not sure I would drive to it for it's own right though."}
{"text":"I've been in twice and ordered the same thing each time, a vanilla latte. The first visit was better as it seemed the Barista really knew what he was doing. I loved that he poured my drink in a tall glass, a real one, and topped it off with an artistic design. The only complaint was that it tasted lukewarm to warm and not near hot. The second visit the Barista made it twice (I think he may have been new), put it in a to go cup instead of a glass, and once again it was lukewarm and unfortunately was not a good taste. 

Pros- great location off the main strip away from the tourists. Good atmosphere with nice music, good seating, wifi, etc. Awesome hours of operation- most of the area shuts down at 5 on a Sunday night but this place goes through 9. Thus my reasons for giving it four stars, I mean come on- until 9 on a Sunday!

Cons- latte's are not super hot, more on the warm side and pastries look better than they taste."}
{"text":"This coffee spot is great, I went in and asked the kid behind the counter if he was good at latte art, he said yes, I think I made him super nervous! He was shaking the whole time he was making my drink and latte art was nonexistent but I must say the coffee was delicious and both people behind the counter were friendly. I don't understand why people go to Starbucks when you can get good coffee at places like Cartel! Try it out I don't think you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ever since I was introduced to this small and hidden place I was seriously impressed. As a Design student at ASU and a lover of coffee this place is perfect. I love the settings and the coffee. The awkward warehouse disorganization might turn some people off to this place but I hope that the coffee can speak for it. The Espresso Excelente is especially the best! Who would have thought to take a staple drink of the southwest and combine it with shot of espresso and create something so good!!!! I'm used to the Vente size and the crack head size large from Mcdonalds I wish they had this in a larger that life size to help me get my fix. ha. 
The best of the best and the people there are way too cool. Never had anyone explain everything in such detail before. I'm hooked and this is my Tempe spot!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and coffee before our hike to Sedona.

The coffee here is EXCELLENT. Smooth and so, so good.

I had the chocolate peanut scone and my friend had the strawberry pop-tart. Both were fantastic! 

Love the laid back vibe here. There was plenty of seating and I appreciated the attention to detail in their decor. 

Overall, solid place for a quick coffee or to hang out with friends. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst tasting coffee I've had, not to mention that it was $5 for what is basically a sample size. Everyone raves about the atmosphere, but all I see are disgusting, ripped up couches and poorly placed tables (this coming from an Austin native where ripped up couches are trendy)."}
{"text":"This location is awesome. It's huge and has tons of seating for studying, chillin, meeting up with friends, etc. There are even loungey couch looking things in the very back. Staff was super friendly. It's right next to Casey Moores, so you can do some work than go grab a beer. You can also get beer here which is a plus. They play great music and are super close to campus which is awesome as well."}
{"text":"Notables:
-Wide range of roasts that appeal to almost any coffee preference (save for you weirdo super dark drinkers)
-Espresso Excelente = Horchata with shots.  Literally.
-Handmade furniture and fixtures care of owner Jason littered throughout.
-All prices figured to 5 or 0 (aka no pennies necessary)
-Staff legitimately cares about all aspects of coffee and some aspects of tea

Especially Notable:
-If you were to have taken Cartel's regular clientele and plopped them down into another very good coffee shop like Lux, they would all have sat separately and talked sparingly even though the seating at Lux might be even more inviting and communal in nature.  For some reason people open up here.  It is not out of the ordinary for two complete strangers to spark up a spontaneous conversation and actually enjoy each other's opinion on topics outside of the normal social boundary of small talk.  I have been to most of the other coffee shops in the greater Phoenix area, and while some do have excellent drinks and baristas, none have fostered such an air of openness and loving friendship. 

I never truly enjoyed coffee until I had a cup here (Sweet Yellow, although Blue is great, too).  The existence of this place gives me renewed hope for a resurgence of sincerity and artistry in a town taken over by fearless big boxes and scaredy-cat hipsters and wannabes.

{"text":"Do you enjoy hanging out with hipster douchebags? Are you a hipster douchebag? If your answer is yes,  then Cartel is for you.  The  place is infested with packs of unwashed,  pretentious ass clowns in skinny jeans.  Sure,  the coffee is fine,  but why suffer the hordes of annoying art-school losers just to get a cup of Joe?"}
{"text":"Delicious quality cold brew coffee. The atmosphere is very relaxing and quaint. I love to support a local business!"}
{"text":"Such a great place to have in the PHX airport! I got an americano and it was actually really good. I haven't been to the actual Cartel Coffee Lab, but based off my experience with airport Cartel, I will make a beeline to it next time I'm in PHX. They also have fresh juices from RAD and a couple other healthy options!"}
{"text":"Stellar coffee shop, especially considering it's in an airport. I ordered a Chai Latte and LOVED it. it was perfectly made, and the service was friendly and quick. And the prices aren't so bad either - the latte was under $4.

I wish I'd tried the coffee but will be sure to next time I'm in PHX on a layover."}
{"text":"I can appreciate that customers are often difficult and even laughable with all the  strange requests and particulars. 
 I come for a looong history of coffee so I get it. I also get when co-workers poke fun at customers however subtle or clever the their arrempt.
 That said: I know that the bench mark for any reputable coffee shop is the cappuccino. I know to that ordering an iced cappuccino is taboo and not even a drink. 
 I like to drink an iced latte but can't handle all the milk. So this is how I order 
\"I'd like a small iced latte but built like a cortado...equal parts milk/espresso and a ton of ice please. Thank you.\" 
  Usually this works out and I get a tastey, no grief drink that I ordererd and PAID FOR. This time, however the roly poly lil barista says to me, with some bass in her voice \"Why don't you order a ICED CAPPUCCINO next time...it's a good drink...\" (the other barista giggles)
 Knowing what I know about the industry and Cartels dedication to proper training, I know that this type of statement comes from a place of righteous burn out...
 Cartel: You lost me as a customer. 
 That I can't get what I pay for without the added lip is AWEFUL practice on your/her part. The first thing I was told when I worked at Panther Coffee: \"Make them what they ask for...NO ATTITUDE...no matter how silly they sound. They pay good money.\"
  If you're wondering who your employee was and cant figure it out with the aforementioned description...it was at 3:00 pm, Friday. The roly poly one...
 Best of luck."}
{"text":"Needed coffee, bought coffee, coffee was good. We have had Cartel enough times to know they know how to brew the stuff. They keep the line moving and do so with a smile on their faces. And the coffee is just better that the Bucks, which at times smells/tastes burned. This is real coffee. Give it a try and don't put too much crap in it or you won't even notice."}
{"text":"Had coffee. Much smaller than their Tempe location, they have some nice beers on tap, extra seating in adjoining space. Great way to caffeine-up before walking the streets of Old-Town. Funny how people can sit there for hours nursing one cup of coffee while they stare at their PC screens. Service was good."}
{"text":"Great coffee - great service.

So...again, yelp wants me to type more.  Ok...great coffee - in my humble opinion, it's the best coffee at sky harbor, period."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find while waiting in Sky Harbor Airport during a layover!

They have a great variety of beans and prep options that I would normally only see at a standalone coffee boutique in the city, and they're so well-priced! It was only $2.75 for a delicious cold brew! 

Highly recommend if you have some extra time in the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong at Cartel. This place takes serious pride in roasting coffees from around the World, with a solid selection of local pastries and a chill atmosphere for whatever you wanna do - chat, study, read, people watch, or have a sip and keep it moving.  I've been coming here for several years and it stays strong and among the absolute best coffee and cafes in the PHX area!"}
{"text":"Sadly, if this is what constitutes \"real baristas\" the profession is in a lot of trouble.  The coffee is great...when you can get it. Would have given this location more stars, if it wasn't for how lax and slow moving the employees seem to be. I'm a frequent flier out of PHX Sky Harbor and every time I come by they are always the last ones open in the morning. While every other business has lines and are serving customers Cartel's overly hipster employees seem more interested in blasting Pandora for everyone in the terminal to hear than they are in opening up and serving coffee. I wish that this was a one time thing, but it's every time I visit. This morning alone at least a dozen people stood around waiting before ultimately leaving to get coffee somewhere else. Great business model for failure."}
{"text":"Super hip, great location, tasty coffee. The iced toddy is where its at - smooth and delish."}
{"text":"It seems a lot of places are now offering Cartel Coffee and it's becoming more popular by the minute. 

I really wanted to check out the hype and stopped by last Saturday around 10:30am. After reading a few reviews, I was under the assumption Cartel served some form of breakfast (sandwiches? Burritos?). When I asked the barista, he told me no and pointed to the display case of pastries. I was a little disappointed by this as I was starving.  Nothing in the pastry case really sparked my interest and I had two employees staring at me expectantly. Glancing up, I looked at the very simple menu and tried to gauge what I wanted. Feeling pressured, I ordered my standard go-to drink: a small vanilla latte. The latte was a tiny 8oz and $4 total. Needless to say, I was a little disappointed. (One of my favorite coffee shops has 8oz as their small size, but they list the pricing/sizing on the menu so I can make an appropriate decision.) Taking my drink to go, I slowly sipped my drink. It was a good, decent latte. Definitely better than any chains and a few other local shops I've been to, but not something I'd drive out of my way for. 

A few weeks following my first experience, I decided to give Cartel another go. This time, I knew I wanted to try their iced coffee. I also ordered a large hot latte for a friend. After making the large latte, the barista poured my iced coffee and asked if I needed cream. I told him I definitely needed enough cream to make the drink a mellow khaki color. He then proceeded to take the left-over hot milk from the previous latte and pour it into my iced coffee. Two things. He asked if I wanted \"cream\" not milk. Second, he didn't give me an option to say no to hot milk being poured into my cold drink. Since I haven't been a barista for over 7 years, I decided to go with the flow and didn't say anything. He then handed me my drink and I proceed to add some simple syrup. (Next to the counter, there is a small area with sugar packets, lids, napkins, and simple syrup in a pump.) After adding some simple syrup, I took a tentative sip. I almost spit it out. The drink tasted like oranges. Strong, overpowering oranges. Oh god. I looked up at the barista, but he was already engaged with another customer. Not wanting a confrontation, I decided to take my paid-for drinks and go. I tried a few more sips of the drink, but just couldn't do it. It was horrible. I then drove down the street to another coffee shop (which coincidently served Cartel beans) and ordered a hot latte. 

The hype sucked me in and I'm glad I gave it a try. However, I will probably never be back. There are so many other good local coffee shops near me that I would not go out of my way to drive to Cartel."}
{"text":"This was the best airport espresso I've ever had and a really good espresso outright. The barista paid attention to the details and the staff are friendly. Nice little find."}
{"text":"Warning: Douche Bag level CODE RED!

Here's how my experience went ... 

Me: \"May I have a Carmel Latte?\" 
Employee: \"No\"
.... dead air ...
Me: \"Ummm why not?\"
Employee: \"We don't have carmel\"
Me: \"Ummm I guess I'll just have a Cappuccino then\"
Employee: \"Just so you know it's a REAL Cappuccino\"
Me: \"Okay\" (in my head I'm trying to figure out if I can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not).

So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he'll be moving to downtown Phoenix soon. To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho. What a complete and utter douche bag. Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!).

This experience was months ago, and now they have opened up a shop downtown. Guess what? I'm not going to check them out. Fuck you Cartel. You'll never be Lux, so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you haven't earned.

Complete FAIL. 

For my two cents, skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail. Authentically cool with ZERO attitude, great coffee and no douche bag employees. 

And as for great coffee ... try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool.

---- 
please read \"owners comment\" below ... here's my response ... 
----
Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... I guess my new job  should be to \"promote good coffee in Arizona\" ... and I don't appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee ... 

By that definition I guess I don't know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if it's not acoustic or a good voice unless it's A cappella ... thanks for proving my point. I wouldn't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... (I guess) they don't need your business you poser!"}
{"text":"The best non-Scottsdale in Scottsdale!  The decor, as with the other location, is a bit \"industrial.\"  That is, long wooden tables á la picnic tables provide most of the work space, and it feels like a hipster classroom at times with everyone on their MacBooks.  However, this is not necessarily a negative, especially given some of the options in this part of town.  Outside space is very nice.  But most importantly:  The coffee and teas are awesome, brewed to order, and the staff is wonderful.  The music is always great, but bring headphones in case the music doesn't match your current needs...it's hard to focus on \"work\" when the music and people watching are so awesome...

Same great coffee and staff as the Tempe location. The best."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service! Every person at the counter was smiling and friendly and extremely helpful which is nice to see after a 5 am flight. Creamy smooth mocha latte makes a zombie feeling morning a lot more Alive"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get coffee in Phoenix. With consistent quality and a range of choices, Cartel has something for everyone. Don't expect to find blended drinks here though. 

The staff are absolutely wonderful; they are helpful and friendly, as well as knowledgeable. 

Cartel also offers an array of pastries, including delicious \"pop-tarts\", muffins, pretzels, and even a vegan cookie. They also have salads and juices in their grab and go fridge.

The location is perfect, in the heart of downtown and right across the way from talking stick arena. They have different seating in the shop as well as in the lobby. Definitely don't miss this place when making your way downtown...*cue Vanessa Carlton*...sorry...

Anyways. Cartel is a really cool company and they really care about people as well as their coffee. Seriously. Do not skip this place when you're in town, it's a Phoenix must."}
{"text":"Love Cartel Scottsdale. All of the Cartels, however especially the Old Town Scottsdale location. This place used to be an independanct owned coffee house owned by a church I think, and even though now it is a chain it has maintained that amazing independant feel. 

The staff are supa nice, make anything you want, and judge you hardcore if you put milk or sweetener in your joe. I'm also a big fan of using Square App to process credit cards because they email you a receipt instead of waste paper. I've only ever been for coffee on Sunday mornings to study, work, and read. However they do have a lunch snack option and serve wine and craft beer. 

Can't beat Cartel for coffee anywhere in Scottsdale. 

Each table has is supa orignal, handcrafted. The patio is completely shaded and not bad even on a hot summa morning. Bring a friend and play some of their chess or checkers games or sit and enjoy free wifi: password espresso"}
{"text":"This is the closest to a New York hipster style coffee shop I've seen in Arizona.  They serve beer too.    Cookie happy hour is pretty cool though."}
{"text":"Same great Cartel Coffee in a very open space; lots of open unused space.  Although I liked that no one was on top of me the vacant space (bar with nothing behind it) seemed odd."}
{"text":"All very good here. No honey but they have agave syrup which works great. 6 shot Americano was just right. Nice setting and seating in Old Town. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I went to cartel coffee expecting higher quality coffee but the latte I was given was bitter and unacceptable. That was my first impression also so I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I went there once and was disappointed.  First of all, I paid $6.50 for 16 ounces of exotic coffee.  Secondly, the décor and atmosphere was weird.  I felt like I was in a 3rd world communal; except this one was created by students who've only read about the such places. If you bring your laptop expect to sit either next to or directly in front of a complete stranger.  (A great opportunity if you want to be social, not so if you want to concentrate.) A bonus was the access to the internet, the downside was trying to maneuver over sets of extension cords laying all over the ground."}
{"text":"I especially love the 5th Avenue location in Scottsdale due to it's open windows allowing plenty of natural light in and being less crowded than Tempe. I can't actually recall ever having a bad drink here (not the case with Starbucks). The iced honey latte just enough sugar/cream to make the drink delicious but doesn't overdo it. Plus I had a significant caffeine buzz from one drink for several hours (as a caffeine addict this is also not always the case). My only caveat is I wish they opened an hour earlier so I could stop there before work!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  For some background, I'm from San Francisco so I've had some great locally-roasted coffee, attended coffee cuppings, and roast my own.  On an extended business trip I went to Cartel every single morning and they always impressed me:
* really friendly, knowledgeable staff who takes pride in the brewing and origination of the coffee
* the barista offers great recommendations based on your tastes (as if you were ordering wine with a meal).
* every item I have tried - the breakfast eggs, the pastries, and - of course - the coffee, has been phenomenal.  Always better than expected.
* a great place to hang out with friends around a table, lounge on the couch, or even grab a laptop and meet with someone.  Quiet enough, but by no means a library.

Go here!!"}
{"text":"I will admit I am a coffee fanatic! Not a Starbucks sugar loaded typical addict but a true  connoisseur of delicious coffee. I recently had the opportunity to travel to Australia. I swear on my dogs life it's worth a nearly 16 hour flight for
Coffee in Melbourne. There is no replicating it, I came home seriously ruined. I came home seriously worried that no coffee joint would
compare, and let's be honest I don't add sugar, maybe a little warm milk and I love my flat whites! So sorry Starbucks, my coffee bean farewell because Cartel Coffee has become my official go to joint! My flat white was smooth and creamy, it l didn't need an ounce of sweetener. It was so good I came back for seconds!  So Cartel coffee lives up to the hype - no joke"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the extra 2 minute wait and easily surpasses the quality of Starbucks! I had an absolutely perfect vanilla latte. It had to have been the smoothest roast I've had and perfect amount of vanilla, not over or under done."}
{"text":"Outstanding coffee near the convention center. Don't be lured by reviews that praise the other nearby places. I tried them all during a week in Phoenix and Cartel is the only top quality coffee bar. They also have a limited selection of pastry items for sale. \"Pacific Northwest Quality\" in the Southwest!"}
{"text":"Good espresso/coffee, but not for the price. I do hold it against them that they don't recycle."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the coffee side and not the bar. 
Poor selection and variety of coffee and espresso based beverages. The staff was extremely rude and unwelcoming as well."}
{"text":"I have to say that I've been all over the map activity searching for the best teas and coffees, and I have to say that Cartel is the best in the nation.  There are plenty of great others out there but this is the absolute best and I'm glad it's at one of my normal airport stops."}
{"text":"My friend got a cold pressed coffee. Good flavor but no almond milk offered? Just soy and cows milk. I find that odd. Also, no stevia or raw sugar. Probably would never go back"}
{"text":"Great space and nice wooden seating and tables. They didn't seem to mind that I had my sewing machine out and was doing some projects. I like their savory scones...not sure what was in it, but boy was it delicious!

The iced coffee is pretty slamming and I liked that they played 70s Brazilan romantic music. I didn't care for the hardcore indie rap stuff... as I'm not hardcore anyway. People seem to be pretty relaxed and not uppity so that's good. But then again, it's mostly young people so it can't be too \"serious\" of a vibe."}
{"text":"Good coffee, great cold brew. I love walking down there from the ASU downtown campus. It's a nice break, and few students frequent it. The only thing I don't like about it is the seating. It's not super comfy and not conducive to conversations. That said, I'm mostly a grab and go kinda person with coffee."}
{"text":"Obscure microbrews? Weird, edgy music? Barebones furniture? A general warehouse/basement atmosphere? Tatooed baristas with idiosyncratic hats? Awesome coffee? Its got all the hallmarks. Feels just like part of Williamsburg flew to Scottsdale on its parents' credit card. If you need a place to park your MacBook and drink great coffee to fuel those short stories you've been working on for a couple years, this here is the joint."}
{"text":"Stopped in after receiving a strong recommendation from a friend. Mighty tasty coffee, great vibe, and a very friendly and informative staff. Big compliments to Bill for his exuding passion not only for coffee but also for the process and others' enjoyment of it. He went above and beyond in our discussion of different brewing processes, recommendations on grinders, and suggestions for further information. I will soon be back and it's great to see local, independent cultural drivers!"}
{"text":"Overrated, pretentious, and crowded. Why in the hell am I giving them 3 stars?

Okay, the coffee really is that good.

But, I'm the type of girl that needs a little more... cream, sugar, I like my additives--SUE ME.

You order a coffee, you pay for it, you ask politely, \"do you have any soy milk? half and half?\"

*blank stare*

\"Um... our coffee doesn't need that.\"

Bitch! Please...

I love the fact that the baristas seem to be well-trained and well-versed in their coffee-knowledge. Yes, they really are super serious about it. Honestly though, Cartel could do with a bit of loosening up."}
{"text":"I think prices are a little more expensive being an airport location, but my bag of beans came with a free cold brew, which is nice."}
{"text":"This is by far the best coffee place ever for a couple reasons: 1) they roast their own coffee beans, 2) they play the best music, 3) it is very trendy and appreciate that,   3) the coffee is very good!, and 4) they have free WIFI.  I highly recommend this place. If you come here, you will never want to go to a Starbucks again."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place after missing my usual Light Rail stop on my way to pick up a Zipcar at the downtown ASU campus.

First I tried my usual caffeine fix...a nonfat double latte. Excellent.

Second trip back, I gave the breakfast burrito (plus bacon) a try. Delicious. The tortilla was as good as everything inside.

Third trip, a beet salad and a bacon chocolate chip cookie. Bacon and chocolate for the win!

I've been here three times and have not been disappointed. The decor is modest, but functional, as it should be at a good business with honestly good food. The barista is not only knowledgable and skilled, but is also a genuine sweetheart.

It's just a couple of blocks from the Jefferson and First Street Light Rail stop (East bound), so I've been stopping by on my way to work."}
{"text":"Blasting heavy metal, industrial decor, and a menu showing love for coffee contrasted against the difficulty of having a conversation and the coffee itself, which failed to deliver on its promise. 

Another reviewer referenced Portland - they take their coffee and customer experience much more seriously. Still, it's nice to see someone in Arizona making an effort."}
{"text":"Environment was great. Coffee was okay and for parking, you can only be there for an hour or they write you up (warning) first. It makes it difficult to go there to get schoolwork done."}
{"text":"So apparently, I'm weird. People love Cartel and Lux but I'm quite the opposite. Cartel is definitely not your typical cafe. I was at ASU for an interview so I stopped here afterwards to avoid traffic. 
I guess it is supposed to look like a lab so the entrance seemed odd. I wasn't sure if it was the front door or not. Anyway once I got past that, I found my way. I ordered a cafe mocha and I don't like that it was served in a plastic cup verses a mug. The cafe mocha had a weird taste to it. I don't know how to explain it but it didn't taste like all of the mochas I've had before. 
The barista wasn't very friendly either. Even when I explained that it was my first time there. All guys, too. Which is fine, but smile.....
Very hipster vibe....not my type. I don't think I will be returning. Just not for me."}
{"text":"So, I've always been anti-Cartel. I had some pretty negative experiences at the one in downtown Phoenix, so I decided it was time to re-engage with the original Cartel in Tempe.

I first came here several years ago, I believe on some sort of date thingie. It was a really cute place with a ton of hipsters working on laptops or also on dates. The lattes were pretty great, and I thought I could have an LTR with this shop (not the date though). 

Now, after a few years, I came back to Tempe and really appreciated it for the location (there's always parking unless it's a busy night at Casey's), and really loved the employee that helped me out. I was buying ground coffee for some friends out-of-town, and he was really helpful. I have a new-found respect for this place, and hope to come back whenever I'm around to get a latte or some of their great tea. 

Cartel Tempe, you've changed me. Or at least just changed my thoughts on the Cartel brand."}
{"text":"I've been holding off on writing this review because I feel awful giving it three-stars (though I've been debating two). I've gone 5 times, hoping that every time would be better. However, I've had maybe one four-star worthy experience, and that was only the last time I went. 

I was excited to have another local coffee shop downtown, within walking distance from our office. We were big supporters and couldn't wait for the soft opening and then the grand opening (which was actually a great launch event). As someone who loves supporting local when I can, I had such high expectations for this place, which is probably where I'm to blame. 

I have yet to have outstanding customer service, and sometimes quite the opposite. It takes a painstakingly long time for them to make the drinks. Their sizes are very small in comparison to other coffee joints (including local ones), and pretty pricey. My coworkers complain to me that they don't give discounted refills for iced tea. They have taken my order and charged it, then informed us they ran out of soy. While refunding my order, they didn't offer anything for the inconvenience. I guess I just expected more. But hey, the coffee is actually good, but I'm the kind of gal that would rather have a positive experience instead.

I wanted to like this place, I really did. I'll keep going back when I can during office meetings, hoping to keep getting good experiences. I want everyone reading this to try it for themselves and continue to support local - but for me, I'll go with tried and true corporate coffee instead for the majority of my latte purchases."}
{"text":"My friend moved to NYC and asked me could I pretty please send him some Cartel because it's almost Iced Toddy weather. 

LET ME REPEAT: My friend is making me ship him Cartel coffee to NYC (of all places) because he misses it that much. 

As for the scene; It's scenester to the extreme. I'd never want to study here. Grab and go."}
{"text":"This is by far the best coffee place ever for a couple reasons: 1) they roast their own coffee beans, 2) they play the best music, 3) it is very trendy and appreciate that,   3) the coffee is very good!, and 4) they have free WIFI.  I highly recommend this place. If you come here, you will never want to go to a Starbucks again."}
{"text":"Go ahead and walk past that Starbucks down to Cartel. Whether you're a local or just passing through you will not be disappointed with this first class hipster coffee front. The latte is smooth, fresh, and strong just as it should be."}
{"text":"Soooo much better than Starbucks! The menu is relatively small which makes it much more pleasurable to place an order since it's not as overwhelming. 
 
We tried both the iced vanilla latte and the iced agave latte. Both were excellent with a wonderful coffee flavor that went well with the slight sweetness of both the vanilla and the agave. I can't drink lattes at Starbucks, they're always way too sweet but I sure can at Cartel!

Fun, funky environment and really nice employees."}
{"text":"Very cool place. They've just moved a few spots down to the corner of the block; I'm not sure if they're still in the process of moving or if the decor is how they intended, but it's great - wouldn't change it if I were them.

My macchiato is delicious, my BLT and its side salad are excellent. A friendly greeting when I walked in the door, staff seems very chill. Very cool that they do ordering and payment through an iPad and Square - it's nice not to deal with paper receipts. (Why don't *all* establishments default to email receipts with paper on request?) Free WiFi of course. To top it off, I almost always have headphones on when I'm hanging out in a coffee shop, but the jams here are good enough that I'm leaving them off... for now at least."}
{"text":"Only place to get excellent espresso in Sky Harbor.  There's nothing else like this in any airport, anywhere, where actual baristas make your coffee, not poorly trained management company workers.  I literally run to this terminal for cartel coffee.  Also, Tyler is awesome and glad to see her running the place.  

Tip: get your coffee in ceramic cup and relax here for a while."}
{"text":"Quite literally the best cappuccino in Arizona, one of the best I've had in the world.  Just as good as Prufrock in London.  The people of Cartel know and love coffee, and it shows."}
{"text":"I was excited tonight to try this coffee shop that I have heard great things about but I was greatly disappointed tonight. The staff was very rude and unwelcoming and their drinks are definitely not my favorite. I had a simple tea and also tried a iced mocha, both were interesting to say the least. I am a huge fan of hidden gems and privately owned companies that stay away from the corporate model but their customer service is absolutely awful! With so many other choices near by I definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"industrial feel to this place. Good for large groups or if you're alone also. 

Coffee is quite good. It doesn't taste like dirty toilet water like some places. 

FYI the sugar options are limited here. The only sugar they have is some organic type raw sugar syrup or something that you pump out of a bottle like ketchup. Seems weird at first, but the coffee tasted great. One pump should be enough...heh."}
{"text":"Cartel was one of my first destinations to grade when I moved to the area to teach a couple years ago. I usually got the chai tea, which was always pretty tasty. There was usually enough seating and outlets for me and all of the hipsters with their Mac books. The ambiance is hip and creative, and the service was always decent."}
{"text":"Best Cappuccino since Italy. And I drink coffee everyday! No nonsense coffee experts. They won't do cappuccino's to-go, they won't sweeten your drink, true purists. They do offer sweeteners off the register area. Amazing."}
{"text":"A cool alternative to Starbucks. Yep, it's a micro-brew coffee house, with the beans all roasted in the Tempe location on Ash. These folks know a thing or two about coffee, so if you consider yourself a connoisseur of espresso you probably owe it to yourself to give this place a shot. 

The setup is nice, sort of minimalist motif. The menu was quite elaborate for an airport location with all of the standard drink items and the iced coffee was tasty. It's a little pricey but hey it's the airport and it's premium coffee right?"}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a coffee snob, I care about where the beans are grown, how they're processed, technique on the bar, etc etc. Cartel got everything on my latte right. Milk not hotter than 150 degrees, shot pulled perfectly, latte art was nice! All around highly recommend this fantastic little shop for coffee done right."}
{"text":"Just finished off a business trip to downtown Phoenix.  This coffee place is pure bliss, had the Dirty Chai 3 mornings straight, and rolled the breakfast twice -  Big Breakfast Sandwich or something like that (it's huge, and full of bliss), then the Breakfast Burrito.....goodness, this was ridiculously good.  Spinach, believe Zucchini, bacon, egg, taters, maybe other goodies.  And a great hot sauce accompanying.  
Just outstanding.  Loved this place, and thanks for the DJ Shadow on the i pod music rolling.....that was icing on the cake, even at 7:30 in the morning.  Will be back, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I visited from NYC and were told by so many the coffee was amazing. The environment is definitely cool for the area and mimics a lot of bigger city trendy coffee / hang out places. But a bummer on the coffee. Just not as flavorful as it could have been and as if they almost didnt pull a full shot. I think if they nail the coffee, it would stand up to any coffee place in any major city."}
{"text":"I picked up a roast beef ciabatta here, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.

Not cheap $8, but probably not bad for airport prices."}
{"text":"In all my PHX travel & layovers I hadn't discovered Cartel until this one very long and very early morning- YAS thank you for the very delicious iced cold brew and gf muffin! It was everything a tired a$$, cranky coffee snob could possibly hope for. Super smooth cold brew and very tasty muffin with big chunks of dried fruit. Just as good as my fav Denver spots. Thanks Cartel!"}
{"text":"While staying in downtown Phoenix we were looking for good coffee. We did not have to walk far. We wandered in, loved the vibe. The baristas were efficient and very friendly. Ordered a mocha with soy, it was exceptionally delicious! Now back in Wisconsin, craving a Cartel Coffee."}
{"text":"I had one of the best iced lattes ever at this Cartel a few weeks ago. I used to work at a coffee shop and like to consider myself a bit of a coffee connoisseur. The espresso to milk ratio was perfect with just a touch of vanilla for sweetness. 

Also, I like the atmosphere. It's just some chill people getting together with their laptops and a great drink. Plus I'm a big fan of quirky seating space, which they have in abundance."}
{"text":"A big sigh and a \"meh\" which is the sound of me shrugging my shoulders and saying a begrudging \"ok\". 

^^ That's how I feel when people ask me to go to this place.  I am by no means a coffee snob which is probably why I really don't like this place.  All I ever want is either a) a normal coffee with sugar and cream or b) a latte/cappuccino that I don't have to make my \"shot face\" when drinking it.  (Does that make sense? I make a pretty ugly face when I take shots because they're gross and I don't want to make that face when drinking a coffee drink.)  

Unfortunately I've never really enjoyed their basic coffee or their \"fun\" drinks. (And I've tried.  About every time I go I try something new.)  I really like the downtown location for the atmosphere and the food but found that this location did not match up to that.  This location seemed dark and quite frankly messy- everywhere I looked just seemed disheveled and a bit dirty.  I was going to order a brownie but was deterred when I saw a few flies and fruit flies in the case- which I totally get can happen and normally I roll with it but it was the icing on my unhappy cake.  

I do not think I will agree to going to this place again..... maybe the downtown location but not this one."}
{"text":"Great location, REALLY good coffee, I have been coming here for a while, and really like it! I have even set up several business meetings here, however, that is the difficulty... The location, the coffee, so on and so forth are all awesome, however, half the time, the music is way to loud. it is kind of a hit or miss, and it switches from extremely loud and slightly offensive rap, to really great music, at a reasonable level, which is perfect. If I was the management here, I would definitely set up only a few channels from pandora."}
{"text":"I am not a huge coffee drinker, in fact I never drink plain coffee.  But, I have been wanting to go here since reading an article in the New Times a few years ago about the Clover machine, and how this place was one of the few places in the country that had one before Starbucks bought the manufacturer and ended the sale of the machine. 

Fast forwards to today:  I finally went to grab a bag for my girlfriend and roommate.  I hate the smell of crappy coffee being made in the morning and how it infects my entire house.  I can tolerate and even enjoy a nice bean.  After 3 or 4 trips in the area at night without the actual address, I came up empty handed because there is no sign on the street and it is hidden behind another building.  Finally I wrote down the address and managed to find it during the day.  

First impression:  There is a magnetic field that attracts a disproportionate amount of dirty ass, homeless-looking, transient-type folks.  If I owned the joint I would call in an exterminator and mobile pet groomer.  Spray pesticide on them to kill the fleas, and give them a full-service pet grooming which should include de-matting, shearing, a shampoo, tick collar, nail trim, and an ear cleaning.  My dog held his nose walking by these people.  

Maybe they have a must-have-showered-within-the-last-week rule for indoors because the clientele seemed more hygienic.  Minimal decorations, and it is very clear that they are not going to wow you with glitz, glam, christmas cd's or sizes that mean large in 3 different languages.  

Unlike many people on here, I actually was helped by a very friendly gentleman (w/ dreds).  He helped me choose a bag, and get me a drink to go.  I went iced latte to go (it was warm out) and got a Guatemalan bag for the coffee drinkers in the house.  My latte was unsweetened and quite tasty.  They have some very primitive-looking coffee brewing techniques and machines which are pretty cool.  All employees had a smile on their face, engaged in some small talk with a few people and promptly made my drink in a few minutes.  I don't know if they canned all the snotty employees or seeing someone that is 6'4\" brings out their nicer side.  I can only speak of my experience and it was short and sweet.

I would like to comment on  the most snotty-douche-y review I have ever read.  Note to Phoenicians, if you use the word CenPho, you are exhibiting tool-like behavior.  End of discussion.  If you look down your nose and say that a certain establishment does not belong in said CenPho because it isn't cool enough to be around you, you are moving towards the extreme side of the tool spectrum.  If you have to use profanity in a review you can add the title of tasteless.  My hunch is they saw Mr. Lord of Culture coming from a mile away.  You stay in CenPho and let us folks stay in a city and area without the need for catchy nicknames.  Oh yeah, the word poser died in the 90s, catch up.  Someone as trendy as you should know that."}
{"text":"Super slow hipsters working at their own pace. You're at an airport, so speed it up since people have flights to catch. Oh, and my coffee was luke warm when I finally got it."}
{"text":"I am never in Scottsdale, ever. But this one time, I was on my way to my friends' house in Scottsdale when I was feenin for my espresso and  remembered that one of the coolest dudes I know (Don S.) raved about this place. 

Dude was right. This spot takes the cake for flavor. Plus the lighing through the windows and the ambiance was on point. 

I was pleased that they happily made a chocolate milk for the tiny. 

I can't wait to come back and try some other things off the menu. Perhaps sometime for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Cartel coffee seems to be the trendy place to hangout in Tempe complete with urban artwork made from left over bicycle parts, news clippings and artsy posters.  The furniture is equally eclectic, the chair I sat in was from an old hair salon and the table was just a couple of wooden boxes with a glass top.  If you're looking for a trendy place to hangout with your fellow mac users this could be it as long as you're willing to over look the damaged walls, peeling painted concrete floors and shoddy bathroom."}
{"text":"My review is probably going to be very unpopular as cartel coffee has turned to a cult but nevertheless...here we go.
I had to finally try what the hype is all about and ordered a cup of cappuccino. The service and the ambiance are great and the cup of coffee looked gorgeous. The taste however was awful. The coffee was sooooo acidic (citrusy, they say) that I couldn't drink it. Bummer :("}
{"text":"Best place for coffee and getting beans to go for french press brewing at home. Some of the best coffee you will ever have. The latte's are done right with perfect foam and a design to make your day."}
{"text":"New location! Cartel is my favorite coffee shop in the valley. The new space is small and beautiful. Staff is awesome as usual. And the coffee is delicious as always!"}
{"text":"I tried to go to this place once and had trouble finding it. It is a pretty small spot, very cozily tucked inside of the complex across from Wet Paint. If you are having trouble finding it, take note that they have a dangling, long wooden sign that says Cartel outside of their door.
I went in with a mate and we each had a cuppa. She took an iced toddy and I had an iced mocha.
Their beans are quite sapid; a bit piquant, while still being very smooth in flavour. Of course, we both sampled the other's drink, which helped give a slightly well-rounded review as opposed to just having one. I would go back for either or. If you like your drink to taste like coffee and not like some kind of milky smoothie, make sure to ask for an extra shot in your mocha. I don't mind either way.

I don't usually drink milk, but the only alternative milk they appeared to have was soy, and that adds a pretty strong flavour and consistency to an iced drink especially, so I avoided it.

As far as the place itself, it is much bigger than I expected, walking in to it. It has a pretty hip vibe, featuring a space-separator made completely of bicycle tires. There is a book for drawing in on the central-most coffee table that is full of, can you believe it, mostly not drawings, but bad notes. It would have been neater if it was genuinely full of drawings that seemed inspired, but you can't blame that on the staff, really.

It was bustling, full of a wide range of people, and it has a lot of mediocre-to-okay-to-occasionally-something art everywhere that may be off-putting if you have a really critical eye or may be attractive if you like the whimsy.

The parking lot was also completely full, so I parked across the street at the gas station. Don't park in front of the dry cleaner/laundromat- they tow.

I would like it a lot better if it was much more low-traffic, as far as people go."}
{"text":"Excellent place, fully developed and evolved concept. Keep an eye out for their nifty brew guide pamphlet. Busy Saturday afternoon w students a-studyin. Apparently there are a few of these around town, including one at the airport...note to self.  In sum, why choose between beer OR coffee?"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic - great coffee, beer, good music and space to do work if you need it.  The people who work here are extremely nice and attentive, and they all have a good sense of humor."}
{"text":"Overrated. Very empty space inside. Poor vibe for a coffee place. Feel like they are trying to create a city vibe but unfortunately failed."}
{"text":"Love this place! And the coffee and tea are awesome. The staff is cool and always cheerful. Great place to get some work in while having a great cup of coffee or some delicious pastries. Definitely will be back numerous times."}
{"text":"Cartel, I adore thee.

Anytime I have a flight out of Terminal 4 (OK, almost EVERY flight), I will always hike to Cartel over those two other corporate coffee places.

It drives my travel companions batty, but once they taste the goodness that's brewed here, the complaining is quickly replaced with silence. 

The baristas are always friendly, even at the ass crack of dawn seeing as I usually have 6:30 flights out to the Bay Area. 

I always order an Americano, and so far, they make my favorite in Phoenix. 

The cherry and almond scone is a nice treat. 

Thank you Sky Harbor for exposing your travelers to many locally-owned businesses Phoenix has to offer, especially Cartel!"}
{"text":"Happy National Coffee Day!

I know music is subjective, but I did not enjoy the music selections today (rap and drumbeat-heavy), and if Mom and I weren't waiting to meet someone at the coffee shop, we would've left for other environs, as the music quickly put me in a bad mood.  

Thank you, Cartel, for the complimentary large cup of coffee, a choice of hot drip or cold brew, for National Coffee Day-- I received an email last night notifying me of the special day coming, and how everyone is welcome to claim one.  I tried my best to get Mom to choose a beverage (a cappuccino or latte?), so that she could have her own free beverage, while I could have my own free beverage with my affogato order, but she only wanted the free coffee.  Mom thought the drip coffee tasted over-roasted; after adding sweetener and creamer, she must've taken only four sips, tops.  I asked her to get it replaced with possibly a cold brew, which she had commented looked delicious, but she didn't want to ask for another one.  I told her that we each qualified for a complimentary large cup of (hot drip or cold brew) coffee on National Coffee Day-- we only took advantage of one free cup.  

It was the first time I tried the affogato here, made with a scoop of Sweet Republic's vanilla ice cream and Cartel's Gibraltar espresso, and we both enjoyed it!  (It was her first affogato experience.)  The presentation is not as dramatic as Chandler's Peixoto Coffee, where the cup of gelato and the cup of espresso are served on a plate block and you pour it over yourself; It's simply espresso poured over a short glass with a scoop of ice cream. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cartel-coffee-lab-tempe?select=YpOGl3CkId5v_Wx0UIMEQg  I look forward to another on a future visit."}
{"text":"5/3/12


V. and I walked over here after a cool happy hour elsewhere, and this time I brought my beautiful cousin with us.  V and I ordered cappuccino (Cartel was out of V's favorite chai), while my cuzzo ordered an 8 oz. latte with honey.  I also spied a chocolate layer cake, and what?  It's half price during happy hour, you don't say?  Well, I'll have a slice then! 

My cup arrived first, and it was a beauty, so cameras came out.  Soon after, V's and cuzzo's beverages and the cake arrived. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fa1G6WoSdvAO8dzM4FYbUA?select=oNUYZx9Eoo0dUE8Qa_lqkQ#oNUYZx9Eoo0dUE8Qa_lqkQ
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fa1G6WoSdvAO8dzM4FYbUA?select=4EqJGPxNYxB6-tek3iRPQA#4EqJGPxNYxB6-tek3iRPQA  I offered first bites- V declined and cousin dug in, but only to find that it was \"a bit dry.\"  I concurred, but I figured I could just chase the bites down with sips of my delicious cappuccino.  V enjoyed hers, even though she forgot to have them add sugar.  (No biggie... she was able to add later.)  Cousin could hardly taste the honey in her latte, so she visited the sugar station.  She eventually had to abandon her drink when it became too sweet to finish-- all the honey she couldn't taste apparently had settled on the bottom.

I'm thinking this is going to be a tradition of mine when HH'ing in OTS.  :)

{"text":"Came in to order my second Mocha for the morning, since I had to get rid of the first one from Wildflower at the security gate.  Ordered a large mocha and two cookies - vegan apricot and ballerina- and settled for a wait on the coffee when, after 10 minutes, mom alerted me to the fact that we were waiting at the wrong gate!  I had to abandon the $7 coffee and rush towards customer service, and dropped the vegan apricot cookie in the process. Once we secured tickets for the next flight and arrived at the correct gate, I decided to walk back to Cartel and retrieve my coffee.  The cashier recognized me and welcomed me back, and I told her why I had to rush away.  I even mentioned I'd dropped one of the cookies.  As I waited while the barista prepared her orders, the cashier asked me which cookie I'd dropped... Could it be??  Why, yes!  She handed me a replacement for the one I'd dropped in my haste!  

Excellent coffee, a large pastry case with both vegan and non-vegan choices (larger and more diverse than those I'd seen at the Old Scottsdale location), and excellent service deserve five stars!"}
{"text":"Being from Seattle, I was excited to give this place a try after reading the Yelp reviews. I'm in town on a business trip and wanted to work on my laptop away from the hotel, preferably with a very good espresso drink.Maybe Seattle has spoiled me, but I was not impressed with my Americano. Coffee shouldn't need foam, sugar, or cream to taste good, but without these things my Americano was acidic and sour. I liked the atmosphere of the place, and appreciated the wifi, but did not enjoy the experience overall. Also, I wish the girl at the counter had been a little more friendly..."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere!
The Chai, coffee & Zuchini bread added the cherry on top! Will definitely visit again & again.
There's a real nice community vibe."}
{"text":"This place is just as I remembered it. Same ambiance and set up. Although I have had a few more European trips since my last visit and can appreciate the European-esque stand up espresso bar setting more. I ordered a cortado for here since I don't usually see this on the menu except in Europe and other coffee bars and having a real glass is always nice. 

The cortado was okay. It doesn't compare to the ones in Europe and the service was really slow. But good enough for 5:30 in the morning."}
{"text":"Proof that not all specialty coffee is created equal. Okay-- the industrial wood and metal. I get it. Check the box. Also, \"coffee lab\" sounds good, and hurray for Phoenix adding 3rd wave to its scene. But man... I feel like I've been to a lot of cities checking out coffee, and this one wasn't worth the hype. Granted, I'm basing this off one visit and not several. 

Roast tasted over-done and flavor burned out. 

The female who takes our money -- that's all she did. And i didn't see her crack one smile over the course of 30 min. Not even a pleasantry or a grunt. Ummm... Kindness is never out of style. 

I'm not fond of places where you order a Capp or Latte and get asked \"what size?\" Just make it how you do it. But that's not the reason for knock. 

The place felt dirty. Bad service. Burned beans. Not the experience I was hoping for. The homemade Pop Tart definitely salvaged the experience -- holy cow. Yum! And my wife's latte featured a solid espresso shot and even milk. So that raises the stars away from a 2-star experience.

Futuro is still leading the pack in the 602."}
{"text":"My backyard playground is downtown Tempe so I was shocked to realize I had never been to Cartel Coffee. Something was amiss especially since I drink so much damn coffee and refuse to go to that one chain. You know the one: starts with a Star and ends in Bucks and the word is Starbucks. Yeah, I don't care for their product. 

I have one criterion when trying a new coffee shop: espresso. Espresso is truly an art form, and when done well, is almost orgasmic (almost). When that espresso shot hit my mouth, omg! Incredible! It reminded me of rich dark chocolate, the kind not ruined with sugar, but delicious as nature intended it. The espresso was so different than what I expected or have ever had before. 

I liked the menu for its ease and simplicity. This is a coffee shop, not some fake coffee flavored sugar based beverage shop. The beans are always fresh since they are roasted in-house. And the beans are not burnt to a crisp like some places do. (You know who I'm talking about.)

The atmosphere was laid back, service was a little slow, but I wasn't in a rush. I've said it before: I don't like to feel like a number when I'm getting coffee, I don't want to feel like I'm being hurried out the door. So the slow service wasn't a negative for me.

I noticed that the water line that goes into the espresso machine hangs down from the ceiling in plain view, rather than being piped up from the floor. I'm not sure why I thought that was cool, but I did. 

The parking lot is a little hard to navigate because it's not that big. So be aware of that. 

If you're looking for great coffee in downtown Tempe, this is the place."}
{"text":"What a great Americano I had this morning. The people were pleasant, the food shelves were well stocked with healthy options as well as standard muffins and cake slices. But oh! The flavor of the decaf is delicious. Sometimes when I order an Americano at other places I have to go back and ask for another espresso because it was too dilute. But this was perfect and flavorful. What a find!"}
{"text":"They have a very helpful and friendly staff. Lots of choices of coffee, and a couple beers and some wine if you're more in the mood for that. They were helpful in explaining the different types of coffee that they were offering and were patient with all my questions. I normally order a pour over and expect a Chemex but they also had the aero press and the v60 which are each slightly different. I decided to give the v60 a try since it was getting late in the day and didn't want a gigantic cup to keep me up at night. 

There's a standard small selection of snacks (soft pretzel/muffins). I grabbed a pretzel since I needed a light snack after dealing with overpriced airport food all day. It was pretty tasty and not too salty. There was a nice sweet savoriness that was a pleasant surprise. Though, I did not expect it to be room temperature. Still delicious though!

Now let's get to the coffee. It was smooth as a pour over often is. Lots of different subtle flavors that I enjoy from a quality pour over. 

It was brought out with the coffee in a separate glass jar with a lid. Presumably it's so you can pour out what you want to drink and the rest stays hot while you sip it, which I think is a genius move. 

The ambiance is very chill with lots of people working and hanging out or enjoying themselves. The WiFi is also fast and reliable. 

It's definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area and need a tasty drink or a light snack."}
{"text":"The coffee is solid but the service is mediocre at best. Very little service. The word hipster comes to mind. Seems as if they are bothered by your order"}
{"text":"I ordered a doppio espresso. I was told cartel refuses to serve doppio espresso without water or milk because it \"compromises the taste\". The guy sat there and argued with me about it when I could have cared less. I didn't know buying espresso meant I had to argue with a grown man trying to justify why he's working a teenagers job.

Apparently 3rd wave coffee means terrible customer service by rude little twerps. I will never visit cartel again and I live down the street. I visit the starbucks on hardy twice a day for a $2.54 coffee each time. This would be cartels money if they didn't serve coffee with masturbatory pretension."}
{"text":"Great wifi. Not crowded. Plenty of seating. Very hipster place nestled in the heart of old town scottsdsle. Never even knew it was there but the chai tea was top notch! So delicious and lots of yummy cutely decorated foam on top $6 for a large plus $1 tip"}
{"text":"Best place in Sky Harbor airport to get coffee... hands down, but don't take it from me. I should still be asleep."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews of coffee shops but this one deserves praise.

I ordered a small cappuccino to go and the clerk shared that it would need to be a latte because of their methods.  I went with it and it was the best cup of coffee that I've had since Italy.  

This team prepares each cup of coffee with skill and attention.  My drink was a work of art in a cup.  It was smooth, not bitter, and had evident crema despite the milk, plus a beautiful flourish on top.

Yes, the surveys seem true: this does seem like the best coffee in Phoenix... and maybe in any airport in North America.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love it. Very large space that doesn't get crazy loud so great place for an espresso. Coffee and pastries are top notch!"}
{"text":"I was recently at Cartel Coffee Lab and ordered myself a small-size AeroPress Coffee. To my surprise, this small \"kiddy\" size coffee set me back by $3. As I started consuming the AeroPress famous Cartel Coffee, I began to wonder why does Cartel Coffee charge $3 for a coffee, when the often ridiculed and the supposedly overpriced chain called Starbucks offers the same size coffee for $1.75? 

And my AeroPress Cartel coffee wasn't itself that great; I mean I've had coffee of different roasts before, and I'm no coffee connoisseur, but Cartel coffee felt very watery and very plain. It was just like the pedestrian coffee I have sometimes at work.

This place charges $3 for a coffee because Coffee Cartel thinks it's cool; it feels you're obliged to pay for its super-cool chilled out austere interior; it feels you need to pay up for all the nonsensical writing that's scribbled over its walls; moreover it feels you need to experience the pathetic service it that prides itself on.  What a pity!  Need a good coffee, I heard McDonalds is good these days. 

1. Overpriced. 
2. Pathetic Service. 
3. Very limited menu."}
{"text":"Bottom Line:  Really good craft brew coffee.

I passed Cartel Coffee Lab while on a short layover at PHX.  I noticed two things:  hip décor and a sign indicating that they serve some really good coffee.  Not needing another ounce of caffeine I decided to try Cartel Coffee Lab.  Although usually I just get a drip coffee I decided to get a mocha.  It had a very pure taste of coffee beans and cocoa beans.  It wasn't sweet which I liked.  It just tasted natural and genuine.   The upscale coffee definitely matched the cool vibe of the place including friendly employees and hip décor. After enjoying my highly caffeinated beverage I was ready to walk out on the tarmac and use my hands to push a Boeing 737 to the runway.  :-)"}
{"text":"Coffee's great, very expensive (like, think Starbucks then add a dollar per size). Its a good place to hang out if you have work or honework to get done or if you'd just like to spend a Sunday morning out of your house."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere amidst a boring \"Old town\" that never grew past the seventies. Finally a place with Character.  You can avoid Starbucks and come straight here.  Plenty of Coffee style selections, Aeroplex, Chemex, Clever, etc.   Then there is the Craft Beer.....     However I am slightly disappointed in my Cortado.   The taste is not quite there."}
{"text":"Eat this if you visit! Pop Day Tarts  just try not to inhale it like I did  worth savoring every flaky bite  and oh yeah, serious coffee"}
{"text":"Great place.  Very friendly staff.  The seating is eclectic but comfortable.  The coffee was off the hook. I would totally come back.  Parking is free and there seems to be plenty of parking.  It is on the street, but diagonal slots so more cars can fit."}
{"text":"Hipster heaven! But awful chairs! Studiers beware! 

The coffee is solid. The vibe is super cool. Lots of space, they lay out tons of power strips to charge up your MacBooks. I love the option of grabbing a microbrew from the back. Snacks are super tasty. 

However, what is up with those plastic molded chairs? Anyone with an ass bigger than a 10 year old will suffer in these! I'm 5'11\", 170lbs with a little \"white guy butt\". I stuck around for about 2 hours to get some work done (very fast wifi), but was agonizing from these messed up chairs. Did the owner not sit in these chairs before buying like 50 of them? LOL. Or, maybe that's the whole point. Keep lingerers away in favor of customer turnover with torture chairs! 

Very cool place, but consider bringing one of those stadium seat pads if you're going to hang out."}
{"text":"Obsessed with their chai latte. It's the bomb. The ambiance is fantastic. You can sit for a while, work on your laptop with their complimentary wifi. The only down side is if they are busy they get a little backed up. But their products are worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"For coffee devotees (nerds) only.  I liked the low key relaxing vibe.  Prepare to wait for your coffee."}
{"text":"This was the worst breakfast place I have ever been to. I went there with my boyfriend. They asked for tip up front. My boyfriend ordered green tea. They were out of green tea, so the associate offered a different tea instead of making more green tea. I ordered coffee and was not even pointed to the coffee bar to get cream. Our food took forever to be delivered to our table. My soup was cold! Avoid this place like the plague. The restaurant looks like a gutter and the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Ok - a REAL coffee place and I don't mean Starbucks - this is the real deal and you can certainly taste the difference. You can also hear the difference in the staff and how they really know what they are talking about.

You can tell them what you want and they will make a recommendation - even let you taste a bit before you buy!

I still am in shock that there is a coffee lab in an airport - wish we had more of them!

Great staff - great taste - great price and I mean really great price!"}
{"text":"The longest I've ever waited for a coffee. Terrible service. And then it was bitter and weak. Very disappointing. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I'm torn between the quality product and the poor service and WiFi.  

The coffee is exceptional but the entry fee (getting past the flaming hoops of attitude) to get your coffee is a little high.  Now I guess I'm one of the cool kids at times (working for the man - Buring Man), but unless that comes up in conversation, most often I'm not dressed the part in my business casual and just another target for the staff.

Beyond the slow service and attitude, the WiFi is crap.  They are riding a signal from a neighbor companies (Wet Paint) router.  I wish they'd get their own router and Cox connection!  Hell I'd even set it up for them, and when I suggested putting a WiFi tip jar the customers at the bar were all for it!

I like the location and the product but not the service and WiFi - both things that can be fixed."}
{"text":"I am a rookie to the coffee shop game, as I routinely have my Starbucks everyday I'm in the office (more for the friendly staff at my pref'd location than the coffee itself).
However, I have visited One Coffee down the way from Cartel, and finally Cartel itself.
So far I have had the dark chocolate something something and the herbal iced tea.
The dark choc thing was quite smooth and I appreciated the detail the barista gives each drink, with the leaf design on top.  I've always thought that was awesome when I see it on TV or something.
The herbal iced tea is something I'd like to drink everyday.  It was perfect.  All kinds of herbal flavors came together in a minty end.  Definition of refreshing.
My coworkers feel they are pricey; I agreed with them but now that I think about it, I'd pay about the same at starbucks for the kinds of drinks I get.  So I have no issue with their prices.
Atmosphere is laid back and open, plenty of room to chill or get some work done.
Cust serv has been spot on and friendly.
If there is an adverse vibe here as indicated by some reviews and even some friends/co-workers, I did not feel that.  
Or perhaps I am oblivious to it.
If I have the chance to sample some more serious drinks, they will probably get another star."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best coffee you can get in an airport! They have aeropress, V60, and chemex with a number of bean options. I hit this spot every time I fly through Sky Harbor!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Wish we had one here in CA. Great vibe once you walk through that door. Fantastic drinks and goodies!!"}
{"text":"High quality coffee & food. The Chia parfait was delicious! Atmosphere is bright, colorful, hip, friendly. This was a wonderful experience & I'd rank Cartel far above the other coffee places."}
{"text":"Best...Iced Chai....EVER! As soon as I am done drinking it I immediately want another! Its heaven in a cup"}
{"text":"Great coffee, amazing employees, and a fantastic atmosphere. My favorite place to write an essay or just catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Downright awesome and extremely hip. A non-traditional, very out there, but very hidden coffee joint.

You can't see this place from the street. It's kind of behind the Buffalo Exchange. It's almost the last place you would expect to find a coffee shop. As soon as you walk in there are really bright and vivid paintings, this is kind of what makes it way out there. Barista was very friendly and asked us how the weather was, always cool to have some small talk instead of the drone, \"what can i get for you...\" Wait, that basically sounds like the boring coffee-grinders at Starbucks.

I gotta have my lattes. I will drink regular coffee sometimes, but my soft spot is a well made latte. Amazing enough, places like Starbucks just don't know how to make lattes, I give up on Starbucks. Their beans suck, and apparently their frothing machines do too, because everytime I go there it seems like they just warm my milk and mix it with some coffee. The latte here was PERFECT. The milk was perfectly frothy, which in my opinion is what makes a latte a latte. Coffee had a nice roasted flavor to it. Amazingly, there are tons of coffee shops out there that can't do decent lattes. This is my new coffee place.

Good music choice here, its like new age elevator music, calm soothing hip hop and pop. Awesome atmosphere, quiet enough to study and have a conversation, yet lively enough to come for just a cup of caffeine. Skip the Starbucks and \"Sex in the City\" sorority girl drinks and come here.

Only problem was that I think they only have small or large lattes, and it was like $4 for a large. That's like $0.50 to a $1 too much in my honest opinion. Oh well, I think I'd still pay that when I'm craving a latte."}
{"text":"I've never seen a complete coffee lab/bar inside an airport before. This is one of the most unique coffee shops I've ever seen.

They have a menu with lots of coffee variety from drips, to espresso-based drinks to nitro brews! They even have siphons! It's like something out on the street but instead, inside this airport! If you're a coffee lover and have a layover inside the Phoenix airport, come here! You'll definitely love what they have to offer.

I ordered a cold brew and enjoyed ever bit of it. It helped me adjust better while being on the plane."}
{"text":"Deciding to forgo the long Disneyland-esqe lines at the convention center's coffee shop, I made the short walk to Cartel since I had enjoyed their coffees at other locations. The shop is small but has seating off to the side that is pleasant and spacious. 

I had an iced almond milk latte. It was made in a short amount of time and I was out the door in just a few minutes. It tasted weirdly sour though. It's quite honestly one of the grossest lattes I've had in a while. While service from the barista to the cashier was friendly, for the prices they charge I wasn't very happy with my drink. The total was a little less than $6.

I guess I should have stuck with the Convention Center's coffee!"}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee is the best place for coffee in town. They also have beer, which is a plus. I have had the opportunity to enjoy both, and I would go there any time. The coffee is smooth and excellent. They have roast their own beans, they have a nice cold press system, and the atmosphere in relaxing. I met a friend recently for coffee while she was in town. We both had the Chai ($5) and it was the best. 
They have a beer tasting room that is open Thursday nights and they produce excellent beer. I had the privilege about six months ago of brewing a beer with them (Cartel The Real Vanilla Heat). The brewers are very cool guys and helped me learn the brewing process. It was really a cool experience to not only see how beer is made, but to actually do it. Their FYITM is amazing. Last year they had a couple others (What's up Doc and Fuktunna Coffee and Donuts) that were incredible. 

Any time I am in Tempe and looking for coffee or a nice beer, this would be the place to go"}
{"text":"It's a Cartel Coffee alright. Mmmmyep. Drinks can vary in consistency depending on who the barista is, (sometimes my mochas have a little too much milk in them, but not by a lot - other days they don't maybe) but such is life I suppose; a bit on the pricey side, but you get a quality cup. They've recently started to foray into teas and the Oolong they served on one occasion was one of the best cups of tea I've had in a while... Though on another day, they served the same Oolong in a pint glass at far too hot of a temperature.. I let that slide though. In the shop they feature local art; last month ago or so they were lithographs of an E100 Corolla and a Previa, two of the most passionless yet innovative examples of Japanese auto engineering in the 1990's... Though that exhibit was actually about the artist's dad. At any rate, this month(?) they're featuring some local furniture pieces and Heavy Pedal track bicycles. It truly is a very eclectic display sometimes. Today, the cream pattern in my mocha looked like a dong.

Parking can be a bit difficult as it is on 5th ave with all the Indian jewelry, souvenir and what-have-you shops, so getting a cup in around lunchtime can be a bit difficult if you're a motorist. Interestingly enough, the pavement on 5th ave is pretty friendly for skateboards (as in, actual skateboards; though cruisers/longboards can absorb the pavement just fine), so provided cars watch out for you (which is unlikely in the wintertime due to snowbirds in addition to the typical elderly folk), it's a pleasant time to just skate on over."}
{"text":"Beautiful cappuccino,   staff knows what they're doing!   Normally don't have such good java at the airport,   I guess those tsa searches are worth the trouble to get a cup of caffeine goodness!"}
{"text":"Cartel has been my go-to coffee house for single origin espresso and pour over, however as of late - I feel that the customer service has declined. 

Let me clarify: The last 3 times I have been to Cartel, the line was not long, there was not a stack of drink orders to complete, and employees were not incredibly busy -- however my wife and I had to wait at the register for at least a minute or more while employees converse with each other or a group of girls that caught their attention (in fact - the girls pointed out to the barista that we were waiting before he turned to acknowledge us), the baristas failed to make eye contact or conversation with me or my wife during the coffee making process or after (not even the usual \"how was your espresso?\" or even \"Hello, here's your drink\" ), and the overall wait times were excessive for 2 out of 3 of our last visits (just over 20 minutes for a clever coffee brew - 2 orders in front of us - baristas chatting with 2 customers and ignoring others). 

This does not taint my view of Cartel of a great place to get a quality cup of coffee - but when a barista under-extracts the espresso, hands it off without eye contact, and walks out of frame before you can mention the tart, thin tasting beverage - Cartel risks losing consistency which is just as important as quality. I don't want to gamble my time and taste-buds for an artisan beverage without a guarantee it will taste good and arrive in a reasonable amount of time.

The great service provided by Seth, Jeff and the girls that worked there over a year ago seems to be diminishing with the increasing size of the location and additional beverage responsibilities that the new baristas have. I hope they turn it around because I find myself defaulting to less tasty coffee options due to expected consistency and customer service. Cartel is not a 'rush-in-to-grab-a-quick-cup-and-speed-to-work' coffee house, but when I want to sit down and enjoy an Americano, I do expect some small level of interaction and consistency with the baristas making my drink."}
{"text":"This is a local chain in Phoenix. Outstanding coffee choices. Usually they have 4 or 5 to select from origins like Honduras, Guatemala & Ethiopia. The size of your cup usually determines the type of pour-over method. Be prepared to wait but sometimes waiting will give you an outstanding result."}

{"text":"Amazing coffee! Great environment! Love that they have cold brew on tap. Huge space so it's perfect to come and get some work done. By far one of my favorite coffee houses."}
{"text":"Oh my! I can't believe that I've lived down the street for 4 years and finally decided to try Cartel today. Well, I did try to go once a few years ago, but couldn't find it. So FYI, the front door is right off of Ash (University is the cross street). 

This place deserves its high ratings. Truly one of the best cappuccino's I've ever had. So rich & buttery. Yum. And just the right amount of foam. The coffee was so good I bought a bag of their fresh roasted coffees to take home. $17! But I guess it's cheaper than going there for coffee everyday. 

The atmosphere was actually pretty nice. Yes, a bit hipsterish, but who cares. It's spacious and has large tables and plenty of seating if you want to come and get some work done. Free wifi too. 

I was actually very productive there today...maybe that delicious cup of cappi was the motivation."}
{"text":"Overpriced Hipster coffee.

First off the coffee wasn't that bad, but it wasn't amazing either.  

This is one of the places where people go just to be seen.  I'm guessing if your here its so you can upload instagram photos of your coffee, because apparently in 2016 if you don't post something it didn't happen. 

I have the strangest feeling that people who are giving this place 5 stars probably pay $45 for \"Color me Rad Runs\" so they can get a profile photo out of it. *rolls eyes*

Do I know coffee? NO I don't because IT'S just coffee. 
maybe there is something I missed here.

Overall If you are some lame Youtuber/Vlogger who post travel Vlogs with a go pro then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee is an awesome place to hang out and relax. The atmosphere is inviting and modern. The service I received was polite and quick.

For more sophisticated coffee drinkers, Cartel has things like aeropressed coffee, but I personally went with an Americano. My drink was freshly brewed and delicious, without even a hint of bitterness.

I have quickly become a big fan of Cartel Coffee Lab and plan to be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I love this place. 

I've already reviewed the location in Scottsdale, but I've come to love this place even more. Cartel Coffee Lab is a high quality coffee shop with an atmosphere that rivals the coffee they serve. The interior design features bags of coffee beans and industrial-looking containers along the walls, which is totally different from the Scottsdale location and is admittedly much cooler. 

The atmosphere is much more focused on the idea of a cartel, which is a welcomed contrast to an otherwise friendly and relaxed vibe. I already can't get enough of this place and it is perfect for students who need a nice place to study and a tasty drink. If you're an avid coffee consumer and you've yet to check out this place, put it at the top of your list. A+"}
{"text":"Neat coffee place that also serves beer!  I like the industrial look to their shops.  It's just a little pricey."}
{"text":"If you care about your coffee, this is the place to go.  It absolutely doesn't get any better than this in the valley.  You really can't go wrong but their lattes are unbeatable.  Also, be sure to pick up some beans while you're there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I popped in here in July 4th when old down was quite the ghost town. We were pleasantly surprised to A fine a place that was open and B that the roared so drinks were most excellent! We wish we had a place like tho in our quaint town of Pleasanton. We highly recommend Cartel Coffee - yum!"}
{"text":"Get the cold brew. Get the cold brew.

I was in Scottsdale for 4 days and each day, I went to get one. I heard it was worth it and it was. Refreshing and very tasty! There is a location in Old Town Scottsdale and there is plenty of parking nearby. Lots of shops to browse around after you get your cold brew or americano (husbands favorite). If I lived in Arizona, I would be there all the time!"}
{"text":"the coffee here is really bitter and burnt-tasting. i guess that weeds out people who arent \"cool enough\" to go here. 

if you are into style over substance, than you might love this place!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff!  Ask for a \"real\" drip coffee if you have time to wait for it.  It's def worth the 5 mins for your own personal coffee!"}
{"text":"The iced chai is my favorite drink here. There are several choices if you want something less sweet. The atmosphere is great to study or hang out with friends too!"}
{"text":"Stopped here at Sky Harbor while waiting for an outbound flight.  The name and layout of the little shop caught my eye.  Bought a bag 'o roasted beans to take home.  Staff was pleasant and well informed.  Offered me a free cup o' coffee!  Wait?  What?  Yeah, man.  FREE cup.  Stupid me declined because I was in a rush.  At home, poured those gorgeous beans into our grinder and was greeted by a heavenly aroma.  The espresso (again, made at home) was full bodied, with nice little sparkle, absolutely no bitterness and was ultra smooth.  Top notch!"}
{"text":"Great lattes and atmosphere.  Unique for sure with an easy going feel and plenty of options."}
{"text":"A great escape, small but filled with culture and ambiance. The place reminds me of being back home in NYC. Theres a hipster vibe and cool talking pieces around the place. The coffee tastes like dirt but we go for the environment. Great place to kill time, read, relax and occasionally catch some live music."}
{"text":"Don't mean to sound like a coffee snob, but love that there is an artisan coffee shop at Sky Harbor. Super convenient location close to Southwest gates that is open super early: 4:30 for early birds!

Bought a pound of coffee and had the Santa Isabel via Aeropress; it was really good. Free daily brew if you buy a pound of coffee. 

Their pop tarts and cold brew are also top knotch. 

This location would be perfect if they had nitro cold brew on the menu."}
{"text":"Okay, you pay for the experience, Cartel is by no means cheap, but it is good. I've watched the company grow since the beginning and at least in the Tempe location, it has stayed both an iconic experience of Tempe life near ASU, and a provider of both exceptional coffee and tea drinks and baked goods. I generally go in for a large, hot, Cafe Americano with room for cream ($3.75 - told you, not cheap) and today I had something new, a toasted English muffin with jam (the person taking the order referred to as a jammy dodger, maybe a UK expression) and it takes a few minutes to toast but it comes out blazing hot with a little bag with a napkin, plastic knife and a little container of butter and one of jam, at least this time it was apricot and it was delicious, I have a feeling it is locally made (assumption on my part). The texture of the English Muffin was wonderful, weighty texture and crusty and I'm assuming it is also locally made. From my final bill it is $3 and of course, I tipped a dollar on the overall cost so $7.75 for the cost of the cafe americano and the baked good.

Oh, and of course, wonderful new locally made art up on the walls again today and some wonderful new music on the sound system.....I don't give a lot of five stars out but honestly, this is coffee counterculture (little play on words, counterculture being variance on the norm and coffee places having a counter on....okay, not that funny but at least I tried). They do have wi-fi and if you buy something you get the password for the day. I generally go when they first open but they are open, I believe, from 7 am till 11 pm at night.

I know they are looking to open some sort of beer and wine bar expansion in the tanning salon location by them that went out of business but Tempe business regulations take some time to go through, and I hear that may involve them brewing their own beer as well, and wouldn't that be interesting?"}
{"text":"I stopped by here just for a plain latte. I didn't expect much from them. I was so surprised when I took my first sip. This was the best freaking latte I have I ever drank. I love this place and wish there was a store in Oklahoma! I totally miss it."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee places ever
The Expresso was so Amazing...Must check this Magical place."}
{"text":"Their espresso is meticulously prepared and served at sipping temperature. The staff chatted easily with morning regulars and engaged me as a new addition smoothly.  Sufficiently comfortable with their own offerings I was happily referred to TOCS for gluten free pastry options.  All-in-all, two Cartel coffees, one G-full pastry and a cookie from down the way.  The Cartel staff made my morning!"}
{"text":"Whoa cowboy....a little pricey but it doesn't get much better.  They have a decent brewery as well."}
{"text":"This is a cool concept but the place is too stuck up about themselves. The drinks are so small and not worth the price they ask for. I would recommend Starbucks over this place in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"6$ for a large Americano which was bitter and tasted like coffee was burned? Not worth it.

Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place... they roast coffee beans at the location and it is always packed.  There are a ton of great reviews as well.... but I have been twice and I am not impressed.  The first visit I placed my order nothing crazy just a vanilla latte.  They were a little busy so I was not expecting it to be a quick wait.  Probably 5-10 minutes later I ended up asking the employee nicely if mine would be done soon because I was concerned that it had gotten lost in the business.  They told me oh yeah it will be done soon.  During this time a friend I was meeting showed up and ordered... everyone who had ordered before and after me had received their drinks but I continued to wait patiently.  My friend (who arrived 15 minutes after me) ended up receiving his drink and I finally asked a second time for them to check on my drink.  At this point 30 minutes after initially ordering the drink the employee finally said \"oh I guess someone took your drink\" which was not the case because I had been standing at the pick up counter the entire time.  I never received an apology or even had them take responsibility for the situation being handled poorly.  Even after this experience I decided to give them another shot today.  The service was much quicker and the drink order was not lost but they were not very friendly and the iced mocha was very bitter and not enjoyable.  After these two experiences I do not plan to return and have to question the reviews they have received previously."}
{"text":"Delicious mocha! Great place to work a little and relax a little for a bit. Coffee is amazing! They roast there own beans at the Tempe location."}
{"text":"You don't have to be a coffee snob to appreciate what Cartel does best. 

One, they care. Order any drink and the barista will take time to make it right, whether that's crafting the perfect espresso or grinding your coffee beans in the French press.

Two, you can order something different just about every time you walk in and it'll still be good.

Besides getting the basics down -- a clean space, friendly baristas who can answer your question and help choose a beverage that suits your taste/need -- Cartel has a few more perks (pun intended) that go beyond your garden-variety Starbucks: Dozens of tables where you can spread out, good-looking ASU students, couch spaces to gather around for casual conversation, and a VARIETY of rotating coffees -- cold brew and hot.

If you can put up with the hipster music, and paying an extra dollar or two for a coffee you won't find in a gas station, there isn't much to complain about here."}
{"text":"The name is catchy and the coffee is yummy. The crew are friendly, as well. I ordered a vanilla latte and it was oh so delicious! It had the right amount of bitterness balanced perfectly by vanilla flavoring and milk froth. I ordered a small one and I sure wished I got the large one instead! It is that good. It is fun watching the crew make the magic happen.

Cartel Coffee was the perfect haven in a busy airport. Take a sip and it drowns the noise and slows everything down. I was a little disappointed that I did not get to enjoy this wonderful concoction on my way home. I had to settle on another brand coffee. Sigh. 

I wish there were more of this around. I love me some Starbucks but there is so many around. Cartel Coffee was a refreshing change. So if you are flying Southwest into PHX, make sure you swing by this coffee place with a catchy name. It will out a boost back into your step."}
{"text":"Loved this coffee shop. Very cool interior with tree stump seating. Their cookies are also to die for.. Try the cowgirl! Coffee was yummy too."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It has a great vibe, like something I would have gone to when I lived in NYC.  A lot of space for seating. And the coffee was great too."}
{"text":"Their coffee is one of the best places I've been to but they made me wait 30 minutes for mine. They should have given me a heads before I bought it."}
{"text":"good coffee, cool atmosphere. went here to meet up for a first little date. nice setting to get to  know someone."}
{"text":"-COFFEE: good & tasty mocha

-SERVICE: friendly

-CROWDED long lines - no where to sit, if you wanted to sit and sip...

-DECOR: Hip, urban industrial

-PARKING: not so convenient if you want to run in and run out."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop here in the valley!! Cool place n cool people. Place is a bit noisy.. but u see lots of students studying here.."}
{"text":"Cool interior with a pretty chill vibe. Looks like a good place to get some work done!"}
{"text":"Great espresso, amazing service.  Sparse atmosphere but who cares when the coffee is this good.  Order a double espresso.  You will NOT be disappointed.  It is literally half the volume of a 'normal' double espresso (served in a single shot espresso glass) but QUALITY WAAAAAAAAAAAAY over Quantity baby.

Update - as it turns out, they don't deliver downtown except for large orders.  Also, the phone # listed on Yelp gets you Tempe.  Hard to track down # for downtown location.  Really hope you start delivering lunch."}
{"text":"Wonderful! I arrived w/ nothing in mind and this made my day! Hard to say. But it might be better than Starbucks across the street. Starbucks was closed when I saw their sign @ 11:10. This was a second option and I'm glad I went."}
{"text":"Very hipster-y vibe. But it won't matter if that's not your scene because everyone here is cool and laid back, and the drinks are great. 

I had the iced dirty chai and my fiancé had a cappuccino. Both were absolutely delicious. The iced dirty chai was really refreshing on a hot day like today. I walked in not really feeling like drinking something hot since I was already sweaty and this drink was the perfect solution. My fiance's cappuccino brought us back to the little cafes of Italy. The foam was just right, and the coffee was perfect - not bitter. The prices are a bit steep, we paid about $9 for our two drinks. However, you will pay about the same price at that national coffee chain. But what you get there are over-sugary drinks piled with whipped cream and caramel to disguise the fact that the coffee itself is nothing to brag about. At Cartel, I noticed that they roast the beans here, the employees look generally happy, the plastic cups that the iced drinks come in are made from 50% post consumer recycled plastic bottles, the straws are made from plants (?!), the cappuccino (to stay) is served in real cups like it is in Europe, and you are helping a local business thrive. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb.

I was told this is a place I absolutely must visit while in the ASU area, but I would argue that anyone in AZ and beyond should try it! 

With that said, Cartel Coffee (and Cartel Brewery) are nestled in the Tempe scene, just walking distance from ASU campus and cherished by students and professionals alike. 

Enter, and you'll see a large interior with a huge variety of seating arrangements - desks, tables, couches, benches, and coffee bar; take your pick! Music ranges from jazz, chill electronica, to the occasional (but welcome) reggae. 

As for the coffee, it's fantastic. Cartel prides itself on sourcing independent coffee from the far reaches of the Earth. They have an excellent cold brew selection, and at night, you can sample their various beers as well. I haven't tried the baked goods - yet - but they look scrumptious. 

In closing, visit Cartel, drink their coffee. It's a great business and a cultural stronghold of the Tempe and greater AZ community!"}
{"text":"I read somewhere that Cartel Coffee Lab is actually one of the ONLY craft brew coffee houses in an airport in the United States. Talk about exclusive right? I mean if I was the only one in the entire nation, I would be a little snobby about my coffee too. They have the usual suspects such as cold brew, espresso drinks, tea, baked goods, and other pre-packaged sandwiches and such since they are in an airport after all.  I was looking at their brew methods and they had a whole bunch of different ways: Aeropress, Hario V60, Clever, Chemex. I have no idea what any of those methods are but it sure sounded fancy!

We just needed some caffeine since we had gotten up fairly early for our flights. We stuck with a simple iced mocha and an iced chai. My iced mocha was fantastic. Just the right amount of chocolate, not too sweet, and not a hint of bitterness. It was very good. My  boyfriend's chai was also quite fantastic. I enjoyed it very much even though it was a tad sweet for me. Overall, we liked our drinks but it was pretty expensive for a small drink. But I guess that's what we get for going to a high end coffee shop in an airport instead of a Starbucks. 4/5"}
{"text":"Cartel coffee is a \"must do\" every time I am in the neighborhood. I love the one and one. Always great baristas"}
{"text":"The iced toddy is the best in town, I love the fact that they have soy creamer. Today I went in to find they now have pastries from Essence. The barista talked me in to a chocolate filled croissant, it was probably 1200 calories and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for work for a couple of days and stayed in a hotel in Scottsdale and my coworker took me to this place so we could do some work in between meetings. 

I loved the coffee. It had good flavor and it wasn't too strong. I also tried their iced teas and some pastries. 

I loved the bookcase at the front! 

and I loved the little room in the back where I could sit and work without being bothered."}
{"text":"I search out interesting coffee shops when I travel, and Cartel Coffee Lab did not disappoint.  I had a delicious decaf pour over and pop-tart.  Both were very good.  My only complaint is that my coffee was not piping hot."}
{"text":"Coffee was decent, my husband got a latte. I got a chai latte and it was way too sweet. I couldn't drink it."}
{"text":"I really like this place and probably come at least twice a week. It offers an atmosphere that can gratify many different groups, from dates, to friends grabbing coffee, to students and employers doing their hard work. The coffee is delicious too, especially the different varieties they offer. It is also dog friendly and another plus- they offer beer! The other reviewers on here are too concerned with what the baristas look like and not how savory their java master pieces are concocted!"}
{"text":"I was totally hoping to give Cartel a 5 star review, because the service, vibe, and concept are AMAZING. Unfortunately, I wasn't particularly impressed with my coffee. I ordered one of the dark roast single brews, and just like every other locally owned/operated coffee house it was weak, and sour... not much better than Pike's Place from Starbucks.. so sad! I don't consider myself an expert on coffee, but I've had some incredible stuff in SF, and can't find anything that comes close, locally. 
Also, when I see all of these super high reviews, I come to wonder how much of the product judgement is placed on fluffy drinks, like mochas, or lattes.  I judge a coffee house on dark roast with cream.. no sugar.. no choco yum yum.. no hazelnut delights.. just.. coffee.. and good basic coffee in Phoenix doesn't seem to exist. :("}
{"text":"Cartel is one of the coolest coffee shops in the state. Whenever folks come from out of town, I bring them here because they always get a kick out of the place. Whether it's the wall of bicycle wheels, the iPad registers, the coffee roaster out in the open, the barber chair seat, the art work on the walls, the funny scribbles in the restroom, the garage opening in the rear--there is something to make you smile here and want to come back.

I've finished many an essay here, applied for several jobs (not at Cartel, just using their WiFi to apply to other places), organized my budget, studied for finals, and even researched apartments here. The great service and ambiance just makes me feel at home. Every now and again, you may get some rude service but they honestly weed out the poor employees pretty quickly. I recommend a hot black coffee or if you're in for something sweet, go for the Dirty Whore (which is just a horchata but it's more fun to ask the cashier for a Dirty Whore). Don't get the desserts here though--they get them from down the street at Essence and charge you more for less than Essence would have given you. Kinda lame but whatever."}
{"text":"Questionable choice of location and aforementioned snarkiness aside, try Cartel if you *heart* coffee, and I seriously doubt you'll have a negative experience.  I had the pleasure of discussing the beans with one of the owners/managers and got no attitude, yet it turned into a lengthy discussion about single-source coffees and roasting/grinding/brewing standards.  These guys simply love their coffee and are on a mission to share the good stuff with their customers.  Gotta love it.

That said, I can't help but laugh at the story about the caramel cappuccino -- and yeah, I'd probably react the same way.  While I was fortunate to want nothing more than the traditional cup of joe, I did smile at one of the many snarky cardboard signs off to the side of the counter that read something like, \"To avoid ridicule and disappointment, please refrain from ordering a mocha.\"  Hey, just because it's a coffee shop doesn't mean that they need to offer the same exact formulaic menu as others in the business.

For what it's worth, this is the only stuff we drink at home now, after trying it first at the PHX Public Market, and then in a gift basket from ZonieBaskets.  I will hopefully never again buy the bulk stuff from Costco/TJ's, which was once my naive preference."}
{"text":"So I'm a huge fan of Cartel, but I think this is an excellent opportunity to keep them in check -- based on a couple of troubling things I observed on my last visit to this location.

First, when I walked in to meet with a colleague, I realized that things were already a little tense between him and the barista.  This was only made worse when he requested a few pieces of ice in his espresso, to which the barista simply replied, \"It'll ruin the coffee, but I'll do it if you still want the ice.\"  I know these guys -- they are coffee snobs in a good way, so I think they ought to try and educate the general public about their passion and be wildly successful.  But tone is sometimes everything.  I literally had to turn my head away to hide my grinning as these two exchanged words through clenched teeth.

Next lady in line, I think, had a crush on the barista or something.  She would not leave him alone about the width of his bike tires.  Not my problem, lady. Let's go.  Please.  This is a downtown coffee shop.  I'm impatient.

Begging silently for a quicker transaction process, however, did little to help things move faster.  As I placed my order for a latte, the barista proceeded to start cleaning his station.  Nice gesture, I suppose (and it was an impressively shiny station), but I'm still more hurried than you are.  This is a problem.

Another glaring problem that I noticed at this point was the presence of muffins/pastries being offered for sale right beneath my nose.... and everyone else's nose who walked up to this counter before me.  I didn't think restaurants could keep the food out in front of the public in such a way.  In fact, they really shouldn't -- not without a sneeze guard at least.  And having just checked the County's food inspection website, it looks like they noticed as well.  Let's hope that this issue, among others, is promptly addressed."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop vibe with super delicious and fresh coffee. They have five different roasts and I got a cup of the fruity blend from El Salvador.  They really know their coffee and can explain all the subtleties of the different varieties.  

I have to say that everything from here seemed to be made with an abundance of love.  I loved watching my coffee being made as the woman oh so thoughtfully poured water through the paper filter so that the coffee was nothing less than perfect.   

In addition to their great coffee, they also have delicious yogurt and granola with fresh strawberries and honey.  They also have a selection of delicious quiches and scones."}
{"text":"A little hipster slice of heaven.  It feels like they pulled this place right out of Telluride and plugged it.  Awesome coffee, they even have beer on tap."}
{"text":"very disappointed,  went in early in the morning just wanting to sit and in joy a coffee. the coffee was only warm and not all that good. there is no comfortable relaxing place to sit. music was way to loud for that early in the day. i left without drinking my coffee."}
{"text":"Smooth and just right! I swear I come to this airport just for the coffee. Very nice baristas that know their coffee. Just follow the coffee aroma. Free smells."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could.  Staff pretentious and rude- arrogant \"barista\" dudes too hip to care about customer service.  Zero healthy food options.  When I asked if they had a sweetener other than Splenda they curtly responded \"no\", not right now. Seriously?  They were absolutely blasting Whitney Houston and Spin Doctors (is this supposed to be hip???)  to where I couldn't converse with someone 1 foot from me, let alone get work done.  I very politely asked if they could please turn it down, they said yes, then turned it up.  It wasn't even 10am and they are blasting this awful music louder than a lame Scottsdale club. Obnoxious place. I'm in my 20's, love Lux and other coffee stops, but this place is a waste of time- these people don't deserve your money."}
{"text":"Great coffee, atmosphere, and service! Highly recommend their chai and herbal tea!!"}
{"text":"When I walked in, I thought \"whoa, I am not cool enough to be in this place\" However, turns out being 'cool' is associated with standing around conversing with one another and friends instead of focusing on making coffee..10 minutes to make a vanilla latte with only one person ahead of me. I figured it'd be the best damn vanilla latte I have ever had. It was not. Cool little place to hang out and chat or get work done, but the service and drinks leaves something to be desired. I'll give it another shot and update my review if necessary."}
{"text":"I've been going to Cartel since they opened. After finishing my dissertation, I took a job across the country and had to leave Cartel behind. In my new home, I told everyone I met about this incredible coffee shop in Tempe and how there was nothing in the entire state I was living in that compared. And then one day I got a job back in Tempe and got to come back. I made sure my apartment was within walking distance of Cartel, and now I come here as much as possible. I hope I never have to move again."}
{"text":"Great location, right smack dab downtown (rather old town) Scottsdale, but where is everyone? Isn't this a touristy spot? It is like a ghost town on a Sunday morning in mid-July. It is also 10 degrees cooler (down to mid 90s) this morning, so I am definitely having a HOT latte. 

The good news? No problem finding parking and no waiting in line to order either. 

Smooth espresso in my latte, but I certainly did not need a 16 ounce (served in a gigantic glass). A 12 ounce in a cup would have been sufficient for my needs. 

Pretty cool art for sale on one of the walls. 

Loved the location."}
{"text":"The coffee is a bit strong but they have good atmosphere, food and happy hour drinks... making this coffee shop particularly cool."}
{"text":"very impressed. The decor has a trendy hipster feel that fits right into its college campus surroundings. The coffee though, was world's better than anything I drank while at ASU! I loved that it was open, but secluded at the same time; I could meet with somebody and have it feel intimate but with every sip still feel like I was part of something bigger. The guy who took our order was really low-key and didn't rush us, was able to provide some recommendations. He also had a sample of a bacon chocolate cookie out and when we took a bite, he was genuinely curious what our thoughts were. For the record, it was very well balanced and a surprisingly good pairing. We bought a whole cookie to enjoy with our latte and tea (freshly brewed!... my latte came out before the tea did). They also have the high-techiness of Silicon Valley with the iPad/square 'register'. Would definitely visit again the next time I'm in town (especially since there seems to be a scookie I need to try!). Only downside is the one-hour parking out in front; this hidden gem (literally!... you don't see it from the street) or bldg management should consider relaxing that a bit."}
{"text":"Starbucks? Naw, this place is way cooler. Do yourself a favor and try something new. This place is hip and has fast service. The cappucino I ordered was strong and gave me that extra boost I was looking for!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this brief.

Highly overrated. Limited selection. Prices not even visible from three feet. Baristas acting as if their dog had been shot or run over. People huddled in front of the computers ignoring each other. Two people out of 20 or so having a face-to-face conversation. Wow. The atmosphere was more of a computer lab full of emo nerds in somebody's basement, and I don't mean that in a good way. Oh. The prices are 50% more than what you would pay anywhere else and the quality is average. This could be revamped on Kitchen Nightmares.

Some improvements would be to change the lighting, rearrange the furniture, replace the computer lab with bar games, use a chalkboard with the prices easily visible, train the baristas on customer service 101 or replace them with motivated college kids with people skills, and so forth. Not all that hard to do."}
{"text":"As husband of a barista trainer my standards are high. Best cappuccino in an airport EVER. Great service, very efficient."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my regular brewed coffee very much, but the latte drinker gave it a \"meh\" and took a LONG time to get drinks.  Kind of a hipster place.  I think for the amount of time it took to get coffee on a Sunday morning, I'd pass."}
{"text":"Great customer service and very tasty Mocha. There is great seating area for businesses or just to take some pictures of your favorite drinks and pastries ;)"}
{"text":"I really miss my morning cold brew. I moved to Washington and I have tried so many. And  nothing compares to cartels coffee."}
{"text":"Best coffee place that we found in Scottsdale ..
This is a destination stop if you are out that way!"}
{"text":"These people are experts in their field.  Experts.  

You want quality, This place delivers.  They do not skimp on anything.  The mocha's are made with the most amazing chocolate - egads, I wish I had one now.  

I wish this place was local to me - but I certainly make an effort to get there as often as I can.  Thinking about going now . . . who's up for it?"}
{"text":"You can't get a better latte in Phoenix than at a Cartel. That's just a fact. Even more impressive is their unbelievably great food. Turkey sandwich, awesome. The freaking spring mix side salad, amazing. What really blew me away was the bacon, (fantastically runny) egg, and onion jam sandwich. I've actually been back 3 times just to get this sandwich. I don't really care for drinking espresso with this sandwich, so I hope that they start carrying some bottled drinks or something. 

In addition to the deliciousness, know that this is one of the most affordable lunches in downtown PHX. I don't know what most of these restaurants are doing charging so much for so little (I'm looking at you, Chloe's Corner), so it's refreshing to find a place that does amazing food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee - great barista. Highly recommended. Don't bother with Starbucks - independent is the way to go."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee in Scottsdale.  Roast their own and quite well.  Enjoyed a fully washed Eithiopian Yirg which was great as a chemex.  Also serve a variety of beer and wine.  Cool decor.  Hipster but mix of folks in there the times I have been.  Espresso and lattes on a beautiful La Marzocco Strada.  Knowledgable staff.  Polite and helpful."}
{"text":"While I love the atmosphere and coffee here, the baristas could give two shits of a flying fuck about throughput. Despite my usual order of black coffee being easy and pretentious - right up their alley - I still manage to wait 10 minutes for service.  I would expect nothing less from an establishment of this tier. 10/10"}
{"text":"Get your drink to-go because they serve those faster. They forgot about my drink so I waited total 30 minutes for a mocha. 
Lighting is dim and music is loud, not really the best study space as some have claimed. 
Probably a good place to chat, but still a bit too loud for a deep conversation.  

Stars are for the cleanliness. At least they have that going on."}
{"text":"This place fills growlers, has excellent coffee, and allows dogs inside the bar.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've heard of Cartel Coffee before, but I had no idea this place had just opened until one of the employees came to drop off some flyers in my office for free coffee.  

This place is located right off the light rail on 1st street close to the light rail stop at the convention center (where I get off at.)  Place is open 7AM to 7PM.  Location is new, and has plenty of seating.  Menu is decent for coffee, but I noticed that they literally have NOTHING to eat at this location.  No pastries, bagels, nothing.  I assume its because they just opened.  Hopefully once this location gets up and running, they will have a regular stock of something to munch on.

I got a cup of coffee, and he made it fresh by the cup!  Holy crap!  NICE!  Coffee was perfect.  I really liked that.  Plus, the guy who helped me was really cool and nice too.  

I will definately be returning here again.  Loved it!  O, and  they have free wifi too!"}
{"text":"Latte art at the aiport?! Yup!

Cartel in is the C terminal. Middle Cs. Southwest.

They have delish pastries, brownies and cookies and well as perfect coffee.

There is a bar hightop to sit at, but other than that, it is a small to go place. There is a Starbucks nearby but you can't beat Cartel. Plus, it sounds dangerous."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here...pick up games of chess, free wifi, sweet tunes, and delicious dirty chai"}
{"text":"We come here quite often to get work done. It's our go-to spot because there is a ton of seating, great music, and woooonderful tea and covfefe! I like the atmosphere here too, it's always real chill, you know what to expect. Eclectic art, smells nice, free wifi. 

They lost a star because they don't have recycling bins. They do offer real dishes so you can avoid the trashy situation altogether... However I've ordered \"for here\" twice and they gave me the Earth killing plastic cup anyway."}
{"text":"This is a very hipster place.  Industrial decor.  Stickers supporting a million causes and tattoos galore.  They have an abundance of seating which is nice and their prices are okay. More than starbucks but tasty.  I had the excelente which is a caffeinated horchata and it was amazing. Omg.  Yummy.  I definitely recommend if you love cinnamon."}
{"text":"I guess if you are not near a closer local coffee shop, this place is ok. It beats Starbucks, but that's about it. I actually really wanted to like this place since they are always on top of the \"best coffee shops\" list. 

The menu is simple...too simple. There is no variety. I am usually ok with a latte or regular coffee, but not everyone is like me. My friend ordered the cappuccino, but the guy taking an order informed her that they didn't have that available to go, so if she wanted it, then she would have to stay there....uhhh why can't I have a cappuccino to go?...stupid. we got a little drink for $3.50....a little..I mean like 6oz. Yeah, definitely not worth it. 

The place is big and loud and uncomfortable. They are trying too hard.

This place is definitely OVERRATED."}
{"text":"* COFFEE AND ALCOHOL *

i wonder if the coffee and alcohol trend started in phoenix.  saw several impressively spacious coffee cafes with coffee on one side and alcohol on the other. starbucks must be copying them since they are going to sell alcohol.

plenty of seating. this is a wonderful place to grab drinks to catch up with friends. we tried the cold brew since it was HOT out (and only march!!). it had good flavor but was slightly watered down.  they roast and sell their own beans. the roaster is onsite. 

there is a sign that says no smoking within 25 feet on the front door.  but of course people were hanging out in front within 10 ft.  i'd love for cops to be able to give tickets for that!!

there is a parking lot and street parking available."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty iced brew. Apparently the recent store front has changed which makes ordering from the street very easy. I simply wanted some cold brew for a red eye flight for which it served it's purpose. Much better quality then SB's burnt coffee or others in that genre. I'm not a coffee drinker typically but it was rich and flavorful. I'd visit again, though not something I'd seek out."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to do at new places is tell the person taking my order: dealers choice. I thought it would be especially fun to say it at a coffee place named Cartel Coffee, however, the woman working, made this experience an entirely unimpressive one. I asked her to make me whatever she wanted, she charged me, I tipped her 60% and she proceeded to pour a black coffee and hand it over to me. I often ask employees to make me what they want because most people take it as an opportunity to wow me, or introduce me to a flavor that they especially like. It's a way for them to be bold and represent the company they work for in a creative fashion. If this employee was representative of the brand Cartel coffee, then my review of Cartel coffee would be: boring, bland, a bit rude, and altogether unexciting. I ask the owners of this establishment - was that what you were going for?

I did give two stars though because I have had worse black coffees."}
{"text":"This place is terrific. It has a Delightful staff that appears to be enjoying crafting delicious espresso drinks. One of my favorite cappuccinos with beautiful art :) they also have wonderful selection of great tasting beers! My only disappointment, there isn't a location closer to me"}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing - great coffee, great staff, great atmosphere. It reminds me of the coffee houses I used to hang out at in Berkeley and Boulder, complete with chess players, tatted up patrons, and eclectic music. If Scottsdale is getting too snobby for you drop in here for some escape."}
{"text":"When I noticed Cartel was listed on Living Social as \"Best place for an espresso\" I was shocked to realize I hadn't reviewed this place yet! Cartel is just a few blocks from my apartment and I must say that in a world of over-convenient, cheap coffee bars and café's Cartel Coffee Lab has done a fantastic job of separating themselves from the pack! Cartel is tucked off of University in a little strip mall but is well worth the visit if you're looking for a place to grab a brilliant brew of coffee or stupendous steep of tea!

Keep singing,

-Jerron"}
{"text":"Another great shop. This coffee shop is right in the heart of OT Scottsdale. The coffee is strong, service is great and the environment makes for a productive work session. Check it out."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to sneak away from work for December Yelp Office Hours and got the chance to hang out with some fellow Yelpers at Cartel. I fell in love with this place the moment I walked in. 

The decor is awesome. They have a ton of random stuff popping about, and the wide-open industrial looking space is surprisingly comfortable. 

They fresh brew every cup, so you have THE best possible cup of coffee you can get. Normally I opt for something fancy schmancy like a non-fat, 5 pump gingerbread latte when I hit up coffee joints, but something told me a good ol black Guatemalan cup would serve me well.. and I was correct! 

I am an AVID coffee drinker. I mean AVID. The Guatemalan coffee, straight-up, with no sugar, syrup, cream, etc... was THE, and I mean THE, best cup of coffee I have EVER had. Hands Down. 

I have since been back twice and the coffee is consistently good. In the future I hope I can try something else, but why mess with perfection????"}
{"text":"I'm almost never downtown during the day, so I'm missing out on the nation's most underrated coffee scene. 

Cartel is one more shining example of Phoenix baristas doing things RIGHT. I had a cold brew to-go from their walk-up window. It was fruity and aromatic, not all bitter and burnt like certain *other* walk up coffee shops. Prices here are reasonable and they're pretty quick. I'd recommend it in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Cartel is exceptional! Notwithstanding diminished expectations because of its location by the gate in an airport. 

The instrument of choice for espresso consumers is, naturally, La Marzocco, the Sophia Loren of espresso machines. CCL's version is a 3-port \"Strada.\" Sleek, tight, stunning, lovely. The espresso is complex and bold, and served on a wooden board with a cup of water and a spoon. I liked the accessories but the espresso alone is Whoohoo.  Provided you don't get it in a paper cup. Not allowed."}
{"text":"Best coffee I had in Phoenix (despite having to drive 35 minutes from my hotel to get there).  Would have gone every morning had it been closer.  Good service.  Cool decor.  

Went in asking for a dark roast, not pour over.  And their drip was everything I could have asked for.  Tons of flavor without that burnt Starbucks taste. It was what I needed at 7 am."}
{"text":"Coffee is good. Very good In fact 
But I give this here low score why because the two cappuccinos we got was barely served low warm. 
U.N. excusable for a store specialist in coffee services 

Hugs."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Everything from the ambiance and the coffee to the ipad credit card signing app makes you feel good about being here. They have an ice-coffee item not on the menu that's already cold coffee, i like to get that. I think its called a totty. Ask for it! Also, the cookies and muffins are great too, definitely not a disappointment."}
{"text":"I love this place. The first time I came in here, I had never had a latte, except at crappy (Starbucks) or mediocre (Xtreme Bean) shops. When I took the first sip, I knew this was a whole different drink. A grin spread across my face as I got first a touch of light airy foam, then rich milk, and finally the smooth taste of the espresso. I thought I would get used to this, but I've been going there for nearly a year, at times almost every morning, and no matter what I get from there, it puts a grin on my face (except the agave latte, I can't believe people drink that). Even the non-coffee-snobby drinks like the vanilla latte, the chai or the mocha are brilliant. I don't go in as often as I used to now, because I buy their beans and make my coffee at home, mimicking their setup as best as I can.

As far as the service, yes it's true, there is some times a bit of attitude, but quite honestly, you're paying a little more to get a skilled person to make you a delicious drink of the caliber you can only get at a select few places in the valley. If you want a fake-smiling robot who doesn't know how to pull a shot, go to Starbucks. If you want a real human barista who will learn your name and your drink, and yes, maybe mock you a little bit for being a phillistine (and we all are sometimes), then Cartel is the place for you.

The only reason I only give it 4 stars is that they don't serve food. I think they said it's because they don't have a food license at this location or some such (and it might be kind of small for a cafe anyway), but it really would be nice to be able get something to eat here too."}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite place for some quality beans and drinks. Also, our favorite Cartel location. We love this location because of the staff is incredible nice and the vibe all around is completely chill. The hubby enjoys an espresso while I sip on a latte or drip coffee. They also have an amazing chai! 
I really enjoy taking home a bag of El Limonar beans. Whenever we have these beans at home I become smeagol and cherish my beans. However, I end up brewing cup after cup. From start to finish, the taste and smell is exquisite and I want it all."}
{"text":"The coffee is smooth and delicious, not to mention delicately brewed and roasted on site. The staff is always friendly eager to help you to make an informed decision about your drink, and I have yet to get a smug look from any of them when I feign ignorance about any drinks. That little test tells me an awful lot about an establishment, and it goes without saying that, while Cartel is a coffee connoisseur's delight, it works just as well for those who might not have a handle on the finer details of this art. 

If there's anything to complain about this fine establishment, it's that there's always a crowd, lending it to being a less than ideal setting to sit and relax, due to a dearth in seating. But if you can find a spot to plop down, you're in perhaps the finest coffee establishment in all of Arizona. That's not an exaggeration."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service! Sean and Raquelle are so nice! We had the Blondie and cowgirl cookies, pear muffin, mocha and chai drinks. All delish. Cute modern look and fun to sit down and talk in after a movie."}
{"text":"Seriously great drinks!  The Vanilla Latte hooked us, but we went back for more right away. The staff is awesome, too!  DEFINITELY give this place a try."}
{"text":"Yo I COME HERE EVERYDAY.... Wish they had a stamp card tho  {cough cough} great coffee and scones. They should make more banana bread. Also discount their baked goods later in the day. Other than that, this is the spot."}
{"text":"What's best to support a local company?   No need Starbuks or coffee bean, when you can have great non burnt coffee.   The decor is fun n hip, I love seeing the different customers there too.   Everyone is nice n down to earth.... They also have wifi and great music, while u sip your hot or iced mojo...."}
{"text":"The service was impeccable and the atmosphere just what we were looking for as we strolled through the Waterfront with our puppy."}
{"text":"Do you want coffee?  Or, do you want coffeeeeeee?  If it's the former, walk over to the local mermaid and get your fix.  But if it's the latter....you just might want to try out the Cartel Coffee Lab.  They have coffee and they make it right.

The service was friendly and efficient and the bar talk was coffee nerd just how I like it.  They also have the class to have glass and ceramic so you can have your coffee the way it was intended.  I like a good Gibraltar and they made me a good Gibraltar.

Any time I am in this Airport, I will be stopping here for the best coffee."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that I'd find such a great airport salad at a place called the Cartel coffee lab. Since I'm a millennial I chose the kale, quinoa, broccoli and sweet potato salad. The portion was underwhelming and priced as you would expect for a hipster airport salad, but I must say it was light years above what I've had in the past. The kale was crisp, the dressing tart, although the oil separated because it was cold, but I saw that as a good thing because it meant that it lacked emulsifiers. 

If you're looking for a salad on the go, this is a good place to start."}
{"text":"Where I learned about Toddy Coffee and where hipster meets Arizona!
love the portions, love that people are all on their laptops, love that it's part of Old Town...also love that they serve alcohol ;)"}
{"text":"A cool coffee shop with beer, what could be better? Well how about serving beer past 10:00 on a Saturday?  Totally stupid operating hours for the bar. Reminds me of of more like a dorm room than a place to go hang out in."}
{"text":"What's to say about Cartel?? If you've tried the coffee just once (no cream, no sugar. JUST THE COFFEE. And slurp it!) then you know that it's hands down the best coffee in the valley. Also, it's hipster and crap blah blah."}

{"text":"I hesitate to give this place 1 Star. From the moment we walked in...there was no acknowledgement from the wait staff that we were there. We just stood there for 10 minutes or so. We wanted to get growlers filled and were totally ignored. I would never step foot into this place again."}
{"text":"I did not have time before using to the AP to find a decent coffee shop and by decent I don't mean Starbucks.  Luckily, next to my gate was the infamous Cartel Coffee Lab.  It's the growing trend of coffee, super slow, expensive prices, delicious bean roasted within a few days, free trade, artisanal organic local milk...and unlike other places like this they had sizes above 10oz, however that is for the large size.  I did not like how the small was about 8oz and the next size up was too large...there needs something in between.  I know, that is being nitpicky.  All in all, I was happy with my experience there, but be aware it does take longer.  

The cashier told me about the mocha which comes mixed with local organic chocolate, no whip though. 

I'd like to give this place another go around and try the latte next time."}
{"text":"I found it. The one and only coffee shop to go to in Tempe. Everything about it is really cool; the space, the coffee roaster, the cold brews, and most of all the honest baristas. You can even get organic milk with your latte!
This coffee shop could easily be found in New York or Berlin. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Super clean and great friendly staff. The store was very unique and modern. Wasn't a typical coffee store.

Would highly recommend the Iced Latte. It was very good. 

The staff at the register talked me through their options and why they do what they do. Because of that I landed a great drink!"}
{"text":"This is place is amazing to say the least. My friend introduced me to this coffee shop when we were out one early afternoon and needs a pick me up. Their hot chai was exceptional along with the service. The atmosphere is very welcoming and laid back. Has a salon dryer chair as a seat which adds even more character to the coffee shop. I will e stoping by this shop whenever I am in the area without a doubt."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place, so I was excited to try it.  I know that the airport is expensive for everything, so the $4 and $5 options for a cafe americano didn't really bother me.  What did bother me, was the actual size cup.  A small was almost like a kids size cup and the larger one wasn't much bigger.  

Ordering was quick and it's easy to get a receipt and leave a tip on the iPad machines.  I then waited what seemed like 10 mins to receive my drink.  When I ordered, they didn't ask me if I wanted room for cream, which most places do and I always say no.  In the tiny little cup, they gave me about an inch for room which left hardly any coffee in the cup. I like my drinks piping hot and my drink was just a bit hotter than a warm temperature.  I was able to guzzle it down within minutes of receiving it, I didn't even like the taste.

I'm not one to be negative and as I said, the prices didn't bother me but the size of the cups did.  I didn't try any of the food or other drinks but maybe next time I need to get a different drink, the larger sized cup and/or ask for no room for cream."}
{"text":"Went here to study more than for the coffee. Good amount of plugs and spaces to get work done. Their workers were nice. The cold brew did seem to be watered down and had an odd taste. The espresso wasn't anything that stood out, but wasn't bad. It did keep me up late into the night so that's always a plus. Definitely a college vibe here."}
{"text":"Regular drip coffee had no taste. More water less coffee and nowhere close to fresh. This is the 3rd time in a row. Would rather grab something from a chain than drink this burnt water. More coffee powder and serve fresh, its that simple."}
{"text":"Nice place in downtown. Parking is no problem as there are 2 public lits close. Tge espresso was very good, nice blossom."}
{"text":"This location is preferred to their Tempe and DTPHX locations! I love how it's located in Old Town, where you are walking distance to a variety of shops and restaurants.

I always get the lattes here (iced or hot) and found them to be pulled well. Though I did have a hot latte once served in a beer glass and that was not so nice ... for my unassuming hand. Hot coffee and glass = bad idea. However, I got over that with a little sleeve and having my coffee cooled down a bit. Good coffee here and love the buzz even from their latte.

The interior is very industrial with tons of metal, wood and raw looking. I found the sound to be quite minimal even with such a small space encasing a few number of people. There's seating out front, on their covered porch area (which can be quite warm) and have a quieter back room near the bathrooms that's separated by a door. Music is played at a low volume which isn't too distracting, but enough to break the silence.

Great place to have a chat over good coffee or to work on your computer."}
{"text":"If I lived closer I would definitely come to this location, though I do not ...

If you're looking to be seen ... but not seen,
have this pent up anger built up inside of you or come across that way,
enjoy coffee,
like dwelling in dark places,
wear all black or only wear some type of shade of it (like me),
or have some form of manbun x beard x obscure band tea x clarks combination look

This is your home, away from home ...

In all honesty, with all the previously listed aside Cartel makes damn-good coffee and their corn cookie gives Momofuku Milk Bar a run for their money. 

This location also has a bar and a ton of seating for what looks pretty small on the outside. It's great for socializing and kicking back with friends or on your laptop.

This cartel loving, latte drinking and a corn cookie eating makes this gal hipst-I mean happy. Move over Lux, Cartel has just surpassed you by a long shot."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much when I was looking at the front of the store, but when I walked inside I was blown away.  The coffee was great and fresh, sitting on top of a great atmosphere to blog, do HW, etc.  Definitely should try it if you have a chance!"}
{"text":"Ice chai latte is to die for! Got two large ice drinks for 7 bucks."}
{"text":"I'll preface this review by stating that I'm not a coffee drinker. I depend on coffeeshops to provide me a chill place to relax and read a book while sipping a hot cocoa or the like.

With that in mind, I'm okay with Cartel, but not enamoured with it.  The drink choices for folks like me who don't drink coffee are fairly limited and more expensive that I'd prefer, but tasty enough to not raise my ire.  I'm okay with the layout of the place, but feel like the couches are in an area that's too busy to allow someone to relax.  I'm also not wild about the music selections, but I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to my grooves, so I won't hold that against them.

If I was making the calls, I'd move or just add more couches/chill area to the back and spend some quality time researching acid jazz for the sound system to create a place with real soul."}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about this place!  The latte was INCREDIBLE!  Pastries are great & locally made.

We loved it....GO!!"}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious scones I have ever tasted. And coffee but I'm no authority on that. But wow the scones. And once I got a breakfast burrito. Really tasty. 

Last summer I was an intern in Phoenix. It was a strange experience but when I needed a pick me up (scone), Cartel was worth the walk."}
{"text":"The tea and chai are excellent in this easily missed coffee shop. The atmosphere was great and the barista was super friendly. I also tried a bite of a lemon scone, and it was quite tasty. My hope is that this place can grow and be open on the weekends. It would be a perfect coffee shop to walk to and enjoy morning. Also I think they need a little more sign-age. I almost completely missed  the door. Its a hidden gem."}
{"text":"The barista warned me as I ordered that I was about to start an addiction. Two lattes and a hot green tea later, I am realizing the gravity of his premonition.

Cartel Coffee Lab has to be one of the coolest spots in Tempe. It is appropriately named as a place that would foster an addiction, and addicted I now am. It has the definite feel of an old warehouse. It is dimly lit, has high, exposed rafters and cooling vents, a concrete floor, and a usable garage door at the back. The layout is great, with a bar, several couches, and a good number of tables fully wired with plugs for the mac or pc-wielding crowd. It's a funky place, very urban; the main room is separated by an art installation made of bike tire rims. Cartel seems to attract a hugely eclectic group of patrons, from unbathed hipsters to ASU students to very cool coffee snobs. I sat next to the most interesting man, definitely a regular, and learned that he owns the old flour mill on Mill Ave! He also shared the most delicious almond cookie with me, baked by his father. Very cool. 

Yes, the coffee. The coffee and espresso are fantastic. People complain that the service is slow, but calmatevi amici, they are making the valley's best coffee, to order, and that takes time! Their beans are direct trade, roasted in house. Try the espresso - it's perfect. Regular coffee fan? They use the Clover, a single serve machine that makes every cup special, just for you. They will alternatively use this awesome manual system with paper filters to drip your coffee nice and slow. I like that they make you commit - large or small - and they keep their menu very simple, so you'll need to get your vanilla lattes elsewhere.  Their default milk is whole (so good), from a local organic farm - and so remember to ask for skim if you are watching that waistline. The baristas are super cool and friendly, and gave me a great welcome. 

Cartel is my new favorite caffeine haven. Thank you friend of a friend for the recommendation - I am a convert, and have definitely found my Tempe fix for a great, independent coffee house. I may have a hard time going anywhere else! (Don't worry Lux, you're still my first love, I promise.)"}
{"text":"Always Time For a Coffee Stop!

SITREP

I was in a rush.  Not a RUSH rush.  But a RuSH to get situated at my gate since boarding was to start happening in 10 minutes.  

THE SETUP

I like to give myself some buffer time when standing in line at an eatery/coffee shop because you never know really how long they will take to get your order done - I certainly didn't need a repeat of my Nathan's burger situation at McCarran airport in Las Vegas where my \"5 minutes\" (as clearly annunciated by them in the King's English) turned into 25 mins w/ a large side of attitude from the 2 staff there.

In addition, when given the chance, I like to try a different coffee branding (other than my go-to \"Starbucks\") that I may not have tried before, and that also looks inviting.

SPEEDY

Luckily, Cartel was smooth sailing with getting my large mocha-to-go for my Southwest flight back to Sacramento.  AND they did my Mocha as a sugar-free option, which I appreciate.

ON PRINCIPLE

However, whether here, or Starbucks, or Peets, or a fast food place, etc., I get really torqued for any shop that charges nearly $5 for a mocha that I should - and do - get for between $3-$4 at a non-airport location. 

Please note:  just because you (inset business name) are at an airport location 
doesn't justify nor support the business metrics for overcharging customers.  

This is along the GOUGING you see at the Coachella Music Festival charging $6 for a tiny bottle of water or a Movie Theater charging $6 for a medium soda.  Somehow the notion came along that \"Trapped Audience = Demographic to Abuse\".  I'll never accept that.

therefore, this is a minus one-star whomever the over-charging business is, just to be clear.

THE LOWDOWN

A great coffee stop in Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport!"}
{"text":"On the same day we went to Matt's I found myself back downtown in the early afternoon.  It was Cartel's grand opening or so I had heard on Twitter.  I pulled right up and walked in.  The guys behind the counter were friendly and helpful.  One of them made me the creamiest mocha I have ever had.  It was delish!!  I would have licked the bottom of the cup but my manners wouldn't let me.  They has snacks out too.  I had a delicious scone with my mocha.  And then, I found out that they were giving free 15 minute massages.  I was there!
Chris, the massage therapist, was great.  He was so professional and answered some of my questions.  So I walked out of Cartel feeling refreshed and ready to go to my next stop.  Thanks Cartel!"}
{"text":"Tips:

Homemade strawberry poptart, recommend getting. ~$3-$4

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The atmosphere here is pretty cool with different types of tables and chairs around the area. Parking is a little hard because the outside parking is limited to 1 or 2 hours only for about $1.50 an hour. This place also closes pretty early at 4pm. Considering these things I wouldn't say it's the best place to come and stay for too long.

The strawberry poptart is amazing and I would recommend getting it. The iced latte was delicious as well! Very strong of coffee for those who favor that kind of latte."}
{"text":"The best coffee I've ever tasted. I wish they'd open a location in North Scottsdale. I usually get a latte made with almond milk and agave. I love the atmosphere and all the choices in seating areas."}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee Lab is awesome. They have good, freshly roasted coffee, they can pull a proper shot of espresso, have cold brew, and also brew their own beer. All of which are good. It is my go to spot from now on whenever I am in Tempe for Arizona. Don't pass Cartel Coffee Lab up, I regularly visit the many specialty coffee shops in Southern California, and this place is definitely worth making a destination."}
{"text":"Finally. A place that serves a cortado right. Been searching all over downtown/Central Phoenix that serves you a cortado with seltzer/sparkling water."}
{"text":"This place is beyond your typical airport food, I was so happy to find this spot near my gate! Super fresh and delicious kale, goat cheese, beet, pomegranate, pecan salad with an herbal camomile lavender iced tea! I wish I lived here and could come back."}
{"text":"Was thrilled to see this place at Sky Harbor, an airport that has consistently disappointed me over the years with its generic chain offerings. I bought their Ethiopian light roast. While I didn't find it as amazing as the light Ethiopians from Stumptown and Heart, it was still delicious. I also really appreciate that they give you a free small coffee when you buy a bag of beans. I'm looking forward to trying more of their roasts in the near future."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some of the best coffee on campus...really chill and casual and trendy spot to get some work done with their free WiFi...their vanilla latte is excellent-not too sweet like some places but enough flavor to taste good!! It's a touch loud so bring your headphones if you want to read or else it's a fun spot to hang out at!! The iced tea is pretty refreshing as well!!"}
{"text":"REALLY LONG wait (not cause they were busy at 7am on a Sunday morning ... just SLOW to make the damn coffee!).  After all that ... WORST cup of coffee EVER! Never will return."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is exactly how I'd characterize this place. Their iced-coffee doesn't taste good.  I don't really like the ambiance there. The seats are uncomfortable. I came here twice and I won't be returning, sorry."}
{"text":"A rough architectural contribution to the neighborhood in the way that only kids building a fort could do but delivering excellent coffee, art and ambiance. Their new wave of coffee quality in Phoenix is remarkable particularly with the Costa Rican beans offering a rich moment to be remembered.

I couldn't help but notice as I was waiting, the Cartel upgraded to a La Marzocco Strada. The 2012 Espresso 'Wet Dream Machine.' Still it's an unpretentious place to bring homework, a laptop and just relax in the laid back atmosphere. 

Today I brought a gal with me, way better than a gadget. I ordered up a cappuccino in a large cup and saucer and she a cup of tea. Shot a little man art photography and enjoyed conversation. 

It was the first stop on a fun Earth Day."}
{"text":"The Cartel has beer yep, good beer. 

Stopped in for a cup and loved the house immediately. Walking over to the guys. I order a cappuccino. The i pad and app to pay up is very in genius and gives me a smile. As I am waiting for my drink I began to speak to the landlord in charge of beer. I'm told a few exciting things about the new, one day old beer garden and sample two favorites of mine. 

I sat at a long table next to a chess set. Sure would be fun to play a game right now. I'm facing the street and kinda relaxing from walking. I think I just made about a two or three mile walk. My coffee is hella good. What a great day today was. People walking by the cartel are happy and looking good. 

Boy you know the Lab will be hopped up tonight."}
{"text":"Really cool coffeehouse in Phoenix! I travel here for work and am always trying to take advantage of the local businesses in the area. I had a latte, but will be coming back to try all the different coffee flavors and may buy some coffee beans to bring back home!"}
{"text":"Just go here yes it is good. I drive past 25 coffee shops to go here. Great Staff Great Food and hey The best Coffee. So what are you waiting for get up and GO!"}
{"text":"This is Arizona's best coffee shop. From the perfect pour to the great employees working there just a great vibe.
Don't forget the tasty treats. 
Hunter Pence favorite place to stop"}
{"text":"This place gives off a nice lax vibe. Located a bit from ASU campus which makes it seem like a cozy nook but at the same time always with a sizeable crowd. Makes sense since their coffee is great. I also like their dirty chai. Nice place to study and relax."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to get a few hours of computer time, some tasty coffee and a few muffins.

The awesome:

1. The staff are great, I mean over the top great. I asked if they had any extra stickers and this sweet lady spent a long time searching for them. She didn't find any, but I give her a fat A for credit.
2. They have loads of cool stickers everywhere.
3. Their coffee is toasted just right and wicked tasty.
4. Wifi is fast.
5. Loads of seats to work, hang out, etc.

The not so great:

1. Their muffins were just meh"}
{"text":"I got the daily drip and it was so good.  Having been used to too much of Starbucks, Cartel's slightly sweet light bodied coffee was a good change of taste. The place has a hippy ambience which reminded me of cafes in Austin, TX. It was amazing to see all the in-house roasting machinery. Good ambience, good coffee. Will definitely visit next time, armored with my computer to get some work done."}
{"text":"This is my favorite cold brew iced coffee around. I'm not a coffee expert but based on the Cold Brew that I have had around Scottsdale, this wins. I get my 64 oz jug filled up every Sunday and it lasts me the week. Staff is nice as well."}
{"text":"Don't go if your not hipster and love to listen to the weirdest mix of music ever. I don't get how people go there to study when the music of like chains slapping together is on repeat followed by like jay-z lol. Coffee is good so I give them that. But get your coffee and run."}
{"text":"Hmm... I love the valley's other cartel locations and I'm not going to let this experience stop me from visiting, but I wasn't impressed. Staff were quick at taking orders - took a bit to get my drink, but there was hardly a line. 

I got a small dirty chai. I guess I had never had their dirty chai - I was surprised when I was told it was $5.50. What is this? Over priced crappy Starbucks?? I was even more surprised when I got the cup. It was smaller than the standard small cup. Lastly, if I'm gonna pay $5.50 + tip... I want my coffee to be damn good. The brew tasted burnt and that overpowered the chai. I should have just gotten a regular coffee or a latte. I am definitely disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a coffee snob so my first order of business was to find a good coffee shop on our trip. This was by far one of the best coffee shops I've been to. It rivals Old Soul Coffee in Sacramento, CA. 

The staff was very friendly, helpful and knowledgable with the coffee they roast themselves. 

The coffee was awesome; definitely spend the extra $$ for the Clover Machine coffee. We also had the omlette for breakfast and tuna salad for lunch. Both of which were spectacular. 

We enjoyed the atmosphere as well. The space had a lot of character with their metal/industrial feel without being too corporate (SB) or trashy (like a lot od local coffee shops can be). There was plenty of seating as well."}
{"text":"Wow.
After stumbling across the below rebuttal to a review for their Tempe location, I will NEVER patronize Cartel again. You know what, Jason? If you don't like someone's bad review of your business, either offer to correct the problem or ignore it - don't insult them further. This is truly a disgusting attitude to have. 

\"Wow  Dave! You are hilarious! If only you actually understood coffee, you might have been able to actually promote better coffee in AZ! You shouldn't be commenting about coffee since you drink it with caramel anyway. You should probably rethink that life decision! As for your bad customer service experience, i deeply apologize for that! They no longer work for us. I would be happy to send you a bag of our coffee in the mail, so you dont have to come in. You just have to promise me you will taste before you add! Email me - jason@cartelcoffeelab
(BTW - could you please clean up the profanity?)\""}
{"text":"No, no, no. After reading the below rebuttal to Dave B.'s review, I will never be patronizing Cartel again. If you don't like the review you got for your business, either offer to fix the problem without sarcastic comments, or ignore it, don't respond just to be a jerk and insult the person further.
I had a bad experience at the Scottsdale location and decided to only go to Tempe and only for the chai (which they can't be pretentious about), but that's been shot down as well. Jason can kiss my $20/mo in Cartel purchases goodbye.

{"text":"Drinks were all made with top craftsmanship. Atmosphere was welcoming to all walks of life. Muffins were not greasy and tasty."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's close to campus and has free WiFi. 

It's the ONLY place I go for a chai tea latte. No one makes it better than Cartel. (Trust me, I've been to wayyy too many coffee shops trying their chai lattes) 

The only downside is that the coffee lab is small, and sometimes it's hard to find a table."}
{"text":"Chicago transplant who has spent way too many hours (and dollars) over the years at Intelligentsia on Broadway. Cartel, you take the cake. Started with an americano and left with two bags of beans to make at home. The cashier was super friendly and gave me an iced coffee to go. Highly caffeinated and super happy... I'll be back."}
{"text":"We glance over and see specialty coffee in the airport and had to stop in. Not only do they offer quite a few single origin options but they take the same time and care to make the beverages perfect regardless of the rush. No compromise, worth the price. Vegan pastry options too! Thanks for a great Ethiopia Chemex, Cartel!"}
{"text":"Sad to say after I ordered my coffee, I threw it away. But very friendly bunch of girls work there."}
{"text":"Super awesome hip coffee bar in an airport... that's really cool... plus their coffee was good and the concept for payment etc... is nifty... AND it's NOT overpriced!"}
{"text":"WOW! I'm SO impressed! I had heard so much hype over this place in Tempe from a previous roommate. I figured it was mostly hot air, so I went half expecting it to be nothing better than a regular Starbucks.

Everyone was so friendly, coffee was DELICIOUS, and the salad was so full of flavor and filled me up...all of this for only $8 in an airport!

I had a regular iced coffee and some sort of Thai/Asian salad (peanuts, red & yellow peppers, cilantro, delicious dressing, and other fixings). Get it or at the very least go here!"}
{"text":"When you walk in, be prepared to wade through a sea of Macbooks to the \"MacRegister\".   Pretty sure the term \"hipster\" originated as a password for PC users to get through the door here.   Atmosphere is half of the experience for the coffee shop lounger and though this place has zero personality, it's definitely neck-deep in \"trying too hard\".  
 
As far as the coffee goes, it was nothing exceptional.  However, I will give them credit for not burning the hell out of the espresso, which seems to be a popular trend these days.  The staff was also friendly which brings a 1 star rating up to a 2 because friendliness is just as important as quality when I'm giving my money to an establishment.

Peeking through the reviews, I saw, \"free range, organic only, vodka marinated, all natural (american spirits only, thank you) smoked people to eat\" so if someone could cue me in on that, I might reconsider this place (yeah cannibalism) since there was nothing else spectacular enough to make me willing open that door again."}
{"text":"What wonderful cappuccinos, coffee and mochas. It's always tasty. And the service is friendly and quick. I haven't been here since it's modification and enjoy the open window to the sidewalk. It's wild that it even opens (as the severe Phoenician heat tends to wane). 
The building's lobby now can accommodate Cartel's business. It is a cool and clean use of space where patrons can sit and enjoy their beverages rather than simply walk through for the lifts. 
I'm thankful for their downtown presence and anticipate having their coffee every time I visit the southwest."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great staff, awesome atmosphere. This was my first time in Scottsdale and I loved this area. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This jem is hidden in the back of a shopping center. Inside you will find yourself in an awesome coffee shop with a unique vibe. I love independent coffee shops, so I already knew I loved this place. The menu doesn't look that plentiful, but I heard people ordering things that were not on there. You can tell them to make anything your heart desires. The coffee is a little over priced, but worth it because it is an independent coffee shop and it tastes great. This is a great study spot. It gets packed though so you may have a hard time finding a chair or table. This place is a haven for hipsters and students. All are welcome though!"}
{"text":"Just like Amy B, I found out this place opened because someone came by my nearby office building with 2-for-1 flyers. I've probably been back three times since and have definitely been impressed with the drinks I've had - Americano and a pineapple mango iced tea. I also had a delicious handmade scone one of the visits. 

Definitely don't come if you're in a rush, as the cashier/barista can be a bit slow. (Quality takes time, and he's playing two roles). Another drawback is that while the spaces are optimized for working on laptops (I love the four-person table by the door), there are no plugs available and the wireless info (the fact that they had it or the login info) wasn't front and center. I had to walk up and ask, which was a bit weird. 

Regardless, I definitely like this place for a good handcrafted beverage and I'm sure I'll return many times as long as I'm working or living close by."}
{"text":"Guatemalan Coffee.
Awesome food.
Great Atmosphere....

If you are a coffee connoisseur.. like i claim to be.. then this place is definitely for you. The coffee is brewed to perfection and the ambiance is great. I've been here several times, just to stop by for coffee or to sit and talk with some friends. If you find a nice table it is also a great study spot!"}
{"text":"Organic meets Urban meets Ikea Coffee Shop.

From the outside, I would never have expected that the inside would look the way it does! I parked outside and expected to be a tiny run down coffee shop since the \"Open\" neon sign was flickering. Boy was I wrong! It's got black walls, decent lighting, bike wheels as a wall room divider. Its one of the ultimate college study crash spots. Tall ceilings only adds to the effect. I'd say the music is a bit on the loud side and seems like a place to catch up with a friend, grab a to-go drink, and do some medium-difficult work. Now onto the cappuccino, its more on the bitter side, and I like things sweet. 

Pros: Heart shaped cappuccinos! Close proximity to ASU. 
Cons: Loud music. 
Work Level: Medium"}
{"text":"pretty standard coffee place, very helpful staff. it seems like it'd be a really nice place to sit down and do some work, but I got a take away coffee, and it was p delicious."}
{"text":"Not sure about the hype. Overpriced and funky half n half. Cave like atmosphere although service was great"}
{"text":"Just three things to help you get an idea. 

Sucky customer service. Good iced chai lattes. Pricey. Def not your everyday coffee."}
{"text":"Terffic little hip coffee place with super cold brew right in the heart of Old Scottsdale. Super cute place with long communal tables. Great snacks,  too."}
{"text":"their coffee is amazing, and i do love their savory pastry offers!  the savory galette of the day was an unassuming looking pastry with sweet potato, goat cheese, and bacon?  i got one to take on the plane with me, and it was soooo good!  sorry to the folks sitting next to me, it smelled so good!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of local coffee shops with free wifi. I am also a huge fan of iced lattes. I know, how trendy of me, don't judge, I have some weird phobia about drinking hot lattes...I can't explain it...getting off track...anyway! Cartel!

I really like getting my work done here. This is a short walk away from J's place so whenever I'm in town and need to get work done, I head here.
I like the decor, I like the music they play (I don't even need to tune out with my headphones and spotify like I normally do when at coffee shops), and the coffee is pretty good. The ambience is chill and very oddly conducive to me getting things done. The staff here is really nice and friendly too.

Note: They also always have tempting pastries that one day I am sure I will break down and try. I'm nearly positive they'll be delicious.

Like the 4 stars say...

Yay! I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing coffee! Unique roasts and super nice staff. Definitely worth a walk if you have a few minutes in between flights at PHX!!"}
{"text":"Best coffee I've ever had! I go for the large iced Mocha. Four espresso shots makes for luscious caffeination."}
{"text":"First impression of this place is very urban. The location is absolutely amazing, right in downtown Phoenix with a view of Talking Stick Resort Arena and the light rail running right by us. I ordered a Hot Agave Latte that took forever to get to me. I must say though, my latte was worth the wait!!! So smooth and rich in texture. I would recommend this place again."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Tempe. Super strong. Espresso excelentes and awesome if you want a sweet treat."}
{"text":"Anyone who offers Aeropress coffee is a winner in my book. This place is for anyone who enjoys the art of the brewing process, as it offers the choice of single varietal beans with the brewing method of your choice (Aeropress, V60, Clever, and Chemex). 

I was in town for a conference, and since this was a block away from the convention center, it got busy pretty quickly. At the time, there was only 2 baristas--one on espresso duty, and the other cashier/pourover duty. It was slow-ish, but that's understandable, given the nature of these brewing methods. These baristas take good care of the coffee they're brewing--they do it one cup at a time.

The next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll have to try their espresso drinks."}
{"text":"I love Cartel. The coffee is awesome and the employees are almost always friendly. Do they have their bad days? Sure, but so does everyone.

I've noticed that most of the people complaining or leaving negative (or less positive) reviews are doing so because of the clientele. How immature. Let's stick to reviewing the venue and the product, not whether you like the patrons. If some patron doesn't like a frappuccino and says so to the barista, who really gives two flying pigs? Everyone is entitled to their opinion. My recommendation is to try to be a little less insecure and consider the impact your review will have on the actual business and the people that put their blood, sweat and tears into it, before you start taking away points because a certain part of society seeks out novelty and enjoys well made things. 

Just my two cents."}
{"text":"I have been to cartel in Tempe many many times, so when I had jury duty I had to try out the downtown shop! I gotta say, the espresso is a little smoother at this location. The barista was friendly and the sandwich was good too! I have been back two other times since an the results were the same."}
{"text":"Cartel coffee has some really legit quality coffee that a lot of people look for now these days. Cartel coffee is a very highly of modern hipstered coffee shop in the central of downtown. I visit this place once with my girlfriend and I must say the quality within the coffee is rich and strong. I highly recommend this coffeeshop over any coffee chains out there. You will not get this quality in any coffee from Starbucks or any other chains out there. This place is one-of-a-kind and you are guaranteed top-of-the-line customer service.  I hope you enjoy this review and hope it helps you make a decision and what coffeeshop to visit in the downtown Phoenix area. As I continue my journey's in finding the best coffee shops in downtown Phoenix I will be keeping everybody updated please add me to keep in touch.  Thank you"}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews, but the other reviews of this place have been nothing like my experience. Been to this location a couple times, and each time I've left disappointed. The coffee and tea are good enough, but the wifi and service have failed to impress. I've come here a couple times to get work done before a dinner plan in old town, and I've had to just quit and sit because I can't keep a steady internet connection. The staff are knowledgeable, but my interactions have consisted of lacking eye contact and as few words as possible. Lastly, the price is not competitive with similar offerings elsewhere- but as this is the only coffee shop in old town, I guess they can do what they want."}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the top Espresso stops in all of Phoenix. Tucked away off the main drag, Cartel serves some serious brew and my espresso shots are always like beautiful works of multi-crema art.

The atmosphere is also mellow and open, and a bit less pretentious compared with my other fave LUX on Central.

Take a bag of beans home - The owners tour the world to hand select their beans and then roast them in-house, and the delicious result can be tasted in every sip."}
{"text":"I hate my morning flights out of Sky Harbor, but there is one place there that makes the check in and security line a little more tolerable. Cartel Coffee Lab on the C Concourse. I will make a quick run down there to get my latte before the flight out of AZ. As good as any of the other Cartels in town, this place has great service and awesome coffee goodness that will get you thru that flight with the crying kid and odd smell that is coming from seat 8C."}
{"text":"Great coffee, they take their time making it right. And its not a long wait at all. Was there with my folks over the holidays and they enjoyed it very much. Also ran into Downtown Dan always a welcome sight."}
{"text":"Excellent Coffee!! My Latte was incredibly smooth and the ambiance was very relaxing."}
{"text":"Great pour over.  Chocolate goodness notes.   Super hip music.  This is the art that millennials bring to America.  Chia pudding was fantastic."}
{"text":"Coffee, beer, and food.....everything a girl could ask for!  The lattes are very tasty and is perfectly paired with the Big Ben sandwich.  This breakfast sandwich is a whopper with the right amount of chiplote aioli.  There's plenty of seats in this hip little coffee shop.  Whether you're stopping in for some coffee or there to borrow the wifi, this is a great local place!  I will definitely have to stop in for their daily Happy Hour and check out their drink selections."}
{"text":"Yes! This is totally the Tempe Hipster Capital.
Many friends and acquaintances have gushed about how amazing Cartel Coffee is. Since I love a good iced coffee, I was open to try theirs and compare to my beloved Dutch Bros. 

The signage isn't too loud, so I almost passed by it. There's a parking lot, otherwise if you are getting to-go, park in Casey Moore's (like I did!). I love the open factory space and bags of beans all around. During my visit every seat was taken by someone with a laptop and earbuds. 

I confessed to the nice cashier that it was my first time and I wanted an iced coffee with vanilla and almondmilk. She walked me thru the menu and the shop layout. They pour the coffee, and then we can add whatever we want to it. The mini table is in the corner and a little crowded, but it has all the normal fixins expected. Totally loved the iced coffee, it was probably one of the best ones I've ever drank! And... not expensive like Starbucks. Similar cost to Dutch Bros. 

Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for Coffee in the Valley!

My go-to coffee house near my office, Cartel serves up single origin coffee in different pour over sizes. I love the hipster quality to the space and the people, even though I am almost always the only person in a suit. Given its close proximity to ASU, I imagine many of the denizens are students of some capacity.

Every once in awhile I encounter a long line, but mostly the staff moves drinks very quickly.

While it is very loud in the front, If you need to study or have a meeting, head to the back space behind the coffee bar, and its dramatically more quiet."}
{"text":"Really good coffee in an airport! What a great concept. People working behind the counter were really nice too. 

If you're near the area, come here! At the very least, it's a lot different than the Peet's/Starbucks of airport terminals everywhere"}
{"text":"I defy you to find me better coffee in an airport - anywhere.  Sticking with PHX Sky Harbor's goal of promoting local businesses the Cartel team is churning out the same great beans here as at their shops around town and the prices are no different.  Coffee here, pastry from LGO - if I had to be stuck in an airport on a long layover I can think of far worse places."}
{"text":"Having already mentioned Cartel, my second visit to the small shop on 5th would be much longer than my first as I spent nearly two hours reading, listening to Who/Hendrix/Stones/Zeppelin/Floyd, and drinking an excellent Toddy of 50/50 Black Market Espresso and Viota.  Having obviously grown their fan base and selections (now including breakfast/lunch/dinner/pastries) since my first visit nearly one year prior when I came out for my job interview/recruitment I still love Cartel and stand by my original assessment that both the shop and the beans compare favorably to spots in New York, Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco - I'll have to come back some time to check out the pastries and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Bigger than the one in Scottsdale but with a far less excellent soundtrack and far more hipsters, teens, and college kids trying far too hard to be far too sophisticated I still have to say Cartel's coffee still continues to impress; this time a bold and smooth chocolate toned cup of Guatemalan Finca El Limonar followed by an iced Toddy made with a 50/50 blend of Black Market and Viota.  A local gem to be sure."}
{"text":"Best airport coffee in the country for sure! Love their cold brew and think their dedication to flavor in their coffee and pastries makes this a premiere spot to stop. Unfortunately the c gate is the only location at the airport, but it is worth swinging by if you have the extra time."}
{"text":"Coffee is very good as are the baked goods.  The atmosphere is good for working.  Wifi is intermittent and you can bet the attitude behind the counter will be supercilious.  The culture of superiority is nauseatingly normal."}
{"text":"Riddle me this one, Batman: why are airports such bland, expensive haunts, and who determined it justifiable to rip-off the general public - nationwide - with sub-par dining and drink options? The other day I paid eight and a half bucks for a beer at the Albuquerque Sunport. One friggin' beer, the price of a craft six pack. Want a bowl of stew with that? Expect to drop a twenty. Packing us in like travelin' sardines of the sky, the average airport experience is bound to be colorless, uncomfortable and a pain in the wallet. As a whole, options in Phoenix perfectly match this description for me. Being here is like sitting through a Chuck Norris movie.

Cartel Coffee, by shocking contrast, is like a special guest appearance by Bill Murray: completely unexpected, instantly memorable, and almost familial, this coffee shop has all of the basic ingredients that make this small local chain invariably cool. The barista was, like, my neighbor, with a t-shirt that said something along the lines of \"I Like Cows\". Likewise with the other guy. And the music was really good. And they had cold brewed, my favorite. And so I got my cup and turned around and set myself down on a chair and if only for a moment, just one blink in time and space, I imagined myself upon a little urban cloud of delight.

And then... \"Thank you for flying Southwest Airlines, this is a boarding announcement for Gate 33, scheduled for Seattle...\""}
{"text":"The staff at Cartel knows their stuff.  Their Cold Brew coffee is ahh-mazing, not bitter at all!  Sad that they stopped their hot foods because I loved their breakfast burritos.  But glad their White Chocolate Cranberry Oatmeal cookie is still around!"}
{"text":"I came in 4/28 at 10AM and I am disgusted by how incredibly rude the staff was. The girl in the front taking my order was horrendous. I literally was so turned off of the service that after I got my beverage, which by the way the girl in the front never wrote to use almond milk (I have a dairy allergy), thank goodness I caught that before consuming it, I got the right one but just tossed it when I walked out. The vibe, the energy, the horrible customer service and rude girl in the front killed this coffee shop for me. I will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and friendly service!   Both their airport and downtown locations offer up espresso drinks done right.   I especially like the cortado."}
{"text":"The coffee, atmosphere, and the pastries are some highlights of this location. The one thing that really lacks and keeps me from giving this place a higher rating is the service, or lack of. All in all I do enjoy coming here, grabbing a cup of joe and catching up with friends."}
{"text":"The coffee is like a silence there! I always get the mocha which is to die for! I got a pop tart for the 1st time today it was flakey, not too sweet, strawberry yumminess! It almost reminded me of a toaster strudel."}
{"text":"Great, quality coffee at great prices (even for an airport location). You can sense that the crew is experienced and fairly passionate about their craft. I recommend the One-and-Done which is a side-by-side serving espresso and macchiato for less than $5. Delicious tasting beans that serve up a nice, quick jolt before that plane ride."}
{"text":"After ten years in San Francisco, I can be a bit of a coffee snob.  There's just something artistic about creating a great cup latte, espresso or coffee.  When done right, it's absolutely a wonderful taste experience.  

These guys have figured it out.  More so than any other place I've tried in the Valley.  Went for the first time and ordered a 2% latte...nailed it!  Tons of flavor but very smooth at the same time.

The place is well done but; just like it's predecessor, it's the not the most comfortable place.  I wouldn't recommend for extended hours of work."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, helpful. Can tell they're busy. Excellent cold brew, and wonderful environment."}
{"text":"Even though it is an airport location, this place still has great, fresh-brewed coffee. Don't expect it to be quick unless you get the cold brew or daily coffee. They have been doing cold brew since before it was cool, and they've got it down, but...

For a real Cartel experience, you need to get a cappuccino (\"for here\" only!) or wait 5 minutes for them to brew you a fresh cup.

The pastries are nice, too."}
{"text":"Excellent. A sign reads, \"Complain all you want, that cappuccino is for here.\". There's a reason that has to do with how the foam sits in the cup. Bottom line is that these people care about their coffee and care that your experience is the best it can be. Give it a shot and I don't think you'll be disappointed.

When I ordered a cup of coffee, I watched as the beans were ground and brewed in front of me. Nice!

The cookies are amazing. I especially like the molasses and ginger one: a little bit of Christmas in the middle of August."}
{"text":"Probably the best cup of coffee I've ever had. Definitely the best I've found in downtown Phoenix.  I'm definitely going back for some more coffee and to sample the breakfast menu.  

Excellent service from very helpful staff who talk about coffee the way some people talk about wine. Get a coffee from the Clover machine and drink it black, even if that's not how you normally drink it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Toddy is fantasimoso, atmosphere is way too cool for me, staff is friendly and remember you. For something different try a Dirty Iced Chai Tea, which is also amazirocking. +1 for free wifi, parking can be difficult, if you are cool ride your bike.

Update: I've fallen in love with black coffee because of this place. Thanks Cartel for my new obsession."}
{"text":"Nice hip coffee shop with some dope tunes playing in the background. Dim lighting makes any place cool. I recommend this place over Starbucks or Dutch Bros."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee and place to hang out! Coffee is great every time. Decor is really cool too."}
{"text":"Some mornings I go in there and everyone looks like they're too cool to be in my presence (including customers) and that can be a little off putting; but don't let that come between you and a good cup of coffee. 
It can get pricey fast if you're seeking a latte or a specialty drink...but hey it's worth it. Get a home made pop tart and an agave latte."}
{"text":"By far the best coffee in Arizona!

We traveled Europe a few years back and enjoyed the finest coffees.   

Upon return to the USA, we searched long and far for similar coffee and we found it here at the Cartel Coffee Lab. 

No need to go to Starbucks, when the best is right here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best coffee in the Valley, let alone Tempe.

They roast their own beans on site (roasting days are heaven). At any given moment they'll have a dozen different beans available, and they'll offer you advice on which you might like based on your tastes. They'll tell you about the plantation each bean comes from (they buy limited batches directly from small producers). Then they grind YOUR beans in front of you and use a manual drip filter to brew your coffee while you watch. Cool artsy/hipster/gay/collegey menagerie of folks always there. And great music plus free Internet (though it took forever to get some kinks worked out last summer...)."}
{"text":"The cold brew Guatemalan bean is so smooth and taste with no bad after taste. It's not acidic. Incredible. Must try for cold brew lovers."}
{"text":"Best coffee I've ever had in any location...been to three of their locations in Phoenix area. Found them by chance at Sky Harbor airport location. Roasted locally. I also buy a couple of pounds of whole beans  to take home. Awesome coffee and local business."}
{"text":"Tyler provide excellent service, a great latte and even information about an interesting jazz venue called the Nash at first and Roosevelt."}
{"text":"I don't get the high reviews. I ordered a normal latte and it was so terrible I just gave it back and told them to throw it away. It's the second time I've tried Cartel and the second regret. They burn their beans or brew it wrong. Don't be surprised when you can barely choke it down."}
{"text":"Cartel's the quintessential coffee place for getting what you expect from a popular coffee joint: good coffee drinks, friendly customer service, and a chill vibe. I personally think they get most of their business from good branding and a killer location in Downtown Phoenix. I give them 3 stars because they fit every coffee shop formula to a tee, but seems to me they don't have an edge in being anything but. If you're simply looking for a quick good coffee that is non-Starbucks in the Downtown area, stop by Cartel. If you're looking for something more, I'd recommend trying other coffee shops in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Wowwowwowowowie! This is coffee at its finest! I wish Cartel was closer to home for me in KC since it is on par with the best stuff I've had at home. 

Location, location, location is key for Cartel. Old Town is Scottsdale is über-hip, chic, and the perfect place for this hipster paradise to call home. My apples to apples comparison for my coffee cravings is black drip coffee. Cartel's offerings didn't disappoint and represented the black coffee game with style. My wife's vanilla latte was equally delicious in addition to the homemade pop tart. 

There was also a great mix of patrons walking in early on a Friday morning. Professionals, touristy types (us), students, and others all came in picking up varying drinks from lattes, to cold brews, to growlers. 

Will definitely scout a stop here in the future. Really enjoyed everything about my visit and will continue to patronize small coffee shops."}
{"text":"I just found my new favorite thing about Phoenix!  -Cartel Coffee Lab-
The coffee is stellar, the Barista is friendly and loves to share his art with us! I have notched this place permanently into my best experiences in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazing cappuccino.  Truly awesome.  Free wifi and a place in the back to work.  All good.  Prices as unreasonable as any other coffee shop.

The bad:

Sloooow service.  We were made to feel like an inconvenience.  This is Old Town, not Beverly Hills.

Weird vibe.  Surreal and silent.  Kind of a cold feeling place with no one smiling or laughing.  I felt like we crashed a funeral.  

I will go back for a coffee to go."}
{"text":"Coffee isn't hot enough. Nice little place, funky vibe"}
{"text":"So happy to find this place! Amazing coffee, super friendly and knowledgeable staff. If you like coffee and are in Phoenix, you NEED to go here. Aeropress, Hario v60, and Clever brews!"}
{"text":"We are huge fans of Cartel Coffee Lab. 

The Mrs. is a coffee nut so we drive all over in search of the best cup and the best beans. It is one of our two very favorite places.

First of all, their coffee beans...  We are firm believers in getting beans that are locally roasted. We've subscribed to the belief that flavor is lost  as you get too far out from the roasting. Cartel roasts their own and does a ridiculous job. They do a great decaf and a number of interesting and excellent regular varietals. If you don't already buy locally roasted beans, do yourself a favor and give Cartel's a shot.

As far as their in-house coffee drinks, the Cartel folk are pretty much obsessive in their pursuit of excellence. You won't find the million varieties of crazy drinks they now do in many coffeehouses but  you will find excellent drinks done by people who are serious about what they are doing. I for one, am happy to roll with their recommendations when I am there and enjoy my whole milk, leaded latte with agave syrup. 

They also have a Clover machine (which many say does the best brewed coffee) which does 1 cup at a time. You will also see the beans individually packaged for the clover right nearby. One of the philosophies the folks there have expressed is that you want to get the beans brewing as soon after grind as possible. They've even minimized the number of steps you have to take to do this.

Cartel Coffee Lab is also a very, very cool place. It's kind of tucked away in a strip mall off University back behind Eastside Records. They've taken this industrial space and kept some of that which adds to the charm and also have put very cool local art throughout. Some of it changes which is also nice. They've also fabricated some things like the bar and space dividers which give it a neat look. Their roaster also sits out in full view. In addition to all this, they always have great music playing. Something about sitting down on one of those couches with their background music instantly relaxes me.

And the last bonus for me is that with them being so obsessive about coffee, they also sell some great equipment in the front. We bought our burr grinder from them and couldn't be happier.

About the only thing about Cartel that is disappointing to us is that they have recently stopped pulling decaf espresso shots. From what I understand, this happened because they switched their grinder system out for a better one. I hope at some point, they decide to grab one of their own burr grinders for sale and reverse this change.

If you haven't tried Cartel Coffee Lab yet, it's a must."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good coffee place in Downtown Phoenix. This place opens early morning which I liked. I had their Chai Latte which was pretty good. But.. this place is like the hallway of the building. So a lot of people walk in and out of the building. There is like an elevator that leads to other places located next to the tables. This place gets pretty loud with music and people walking in and out... so I wouldn't recommend this place for study."}
{"text":"The experience at Cartel is exactly what you'd expect at an independent coffee shop. The locale is artsy, the interior is sparsely decorated with geometrically abnormal tables at weird heights, wood and steel stuff and an exposed wood ceiling. If you're into wood and steel, Cartel has it. They were bumping dubstepLite from the overhead speakers, which was an unexpected change from the guitar + hi high and bass drum + croaking off-key vocals that hipsters seem to love. The dudes at the counter were wearing a sufficient quantity of second-hand clothing to make me certain that they weren't employees of a corporate chain, but that they were actually fulfilling their destinies as bearded Ferrymen helping the uninitiated cross the Single Origin river into the Alterlife. Among other customers there was a distinct lack of true artistic souls, which is disappointing, but really out of the control of Cartel. No one had a typewriter, or was knitting, and only one guy had the messy dreadlocks of someone who hasn't sold out. SOMEthing needs to be done before Cartel gets a reputation of being a scene for sellouts and generics.

Enough about the scene, on to the coffee. I had a black single-origin Chemex from somewhere in the global South, and the wife had the coldbrew. The Chemex is 20 oz., which is cool, but $8~. I guess if you think of it as two coffees it makes sense, but $8~? That's almost 50 cents/ounce. \"Well, you were dumb enough to buy it,\" you might argue. Don't use your laissez-faire logic on me, I expect my independent coffee to be fair trade, not free trade. Still, the flavor was mild and spicy, and the mouthfeel...whatever, it tasted like good coffee. The wife's coldbrew was good, but also a little overpriced. Cream is kept under the tight control of the bearded Ferrymen, probably to keep it fresh, and is served infused with non-verbal judgement over your poor choice of diluting the integrity of your carefully crafted beans. This bit of judgementalism restored my faith a little in Cartel. Maybe they have what it takes to be an elite hipster joint after all. Then on our way out the door I overheard one of the Ferrymen describing to Dreadlocks how one of the blends as \"totally cleanses your system,\" and reassurance washed over me. Cartel isn't just selling coffee after all. It's curing people of their ailments and helping them towards a healthier, less skeptical lifestyle.

Great for: people who enjoy the free market
Not great for: people who believe in evidence based medicine"}
{"text":"Finally a good coffee place. I've been looking all morning cee the valley for something that is what I'd consider coffee (not the sour, bitter mess you get most places). This one is it! the people there know what they're doing and it shows. 
And I'm saying that as someone who is very picky when it comes to coffee. I'd rather not drink one than pay for something I wouldn't enjoy"}
{"text":"I'm really loving this modern looking, hip coffee shop! This is a great place to stop in if you are cruising around downtown Pheonix. Plenty of seating inside too, it is kind of connected to another building but open and airy so you can totally bring your laptop or whatever and do some work. The coffee is strong and delicious and they offer some different types of sweet treats and eats to go with your brew. It was honestly just what I was looking for when I spotted it on Yelp - something different and not your regular schmegular chain. Good music too!!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place on YELP. And I can't wait to give it a try next time I'm in the area! A refreshing change from Starbucks. And the Coconut scone and Green Tea looks YUMMY!"}
{"text":"This is a great vibe up front, once you pass the bar, it gets a little weird.  They are trying to keep 1/2 the location 21 years and older for a BAR/Alcohol scene.  Both areas are sweet.  Just, c'mon - this is Cartel \"COFFEE\" Lab man.  Why do you have to make me uncomfortable when space is limited???  Otherwise they have some sweet local derivatives of foreign lands coffee they assemble in their lab.  I suggest you READ the flavor before ordering.  And give it a bit of time, they have professional CHEMISTS on board who extract your brew.  LOL. Cool vibe, rare tunes, weird MF peeps, but hey man we are all weird in our own way, just not so much on the outside always.  CCL is an B+ for me."}
{"text":"We stopped by here when changing planes. I saw the chia seed pudding and I'm so sad I only grabbed one!! This is probably the best chia pudding I've ever had. I wish they could ship me some to my house."}
{"text":"Best airport coffee place ever! Great people, it's like a real coffee house. They really care about the coffee and the experience. I think they should charge more. Most places would charge double for much less."}
{"text":"I usually go to Starbucks for coffee before i travel but all they had was cartel and paradise bakery in my terminal.  I chose cartel because I am not a fan of any coffee/espresso from paradise... I ordered a small vanilla latte which I thought would be 12 oz... The cup was 8 oz so I was a little disappointed.   Took my first sip and it was pure delicious!  Well worth the 4.25 spent!  They take a longer time to make the coffee but it is soooo worth it because it is soooooo smooth... It is located in terminal 4 gate C11-19... worth the walk if you are in terminal D..."}
{"text":"That iced coffee is all the rage, refreshing, tasty, and cheap. It was almost like drinking a soda or an iced tea, but you knew you'd get your coffee buzz on later!

Besides the coffee, they brew their own beer. I got the beer flight and loved every draft I sampled. Even the IPA was good and I'm not an IPA guy. I especially enjoyed the dark coffee stout. None of the beers were \"harsh\", thus they were extremely drinkable. I definitely recommend Cartel."}
{"text":"Seriously my new favorite coffee spot. Got a growler of the Toddy and I almost drank it all in one day. Very affordable and the atmosphere is amazing."}
{"text":"First visit here, so  I won't be too harsh! :-)

Cute space, lots of folks with laptops and such dong research or perhaps writing the next best seller ? Friendly baristas, efficient service. Didn't see a whole lot of munchies for sale but looks like the friendly folks make scones, muffins, cookies and sandwiches too. They also sell their very own coffee! Coool!! Yippy!

I just had a large latte and it was served in a large tall glass and I thought it was pretty tasty...maybe a little more expensive than the average latte, but it was good so no complaints. I love that area of town and wish them much success.

Yep, I'm a fan because I love independent coffee houses and the folks usually work very hard to make delicious beverages and do everything they can to make the customer happy."}
{"text":"Super hipster and trendy, but the coffee lives up to the hype.

Their cold brew was smooth and strong, as well their latte. Their banana bread tasted fresh, and was moist and just a little sweet (also was topped with a slice of baked banana, which was a nice touch). You will pay hipster trendy prices, but the quality is far superior to any Starbucks, and the baristas were friendly and willing to give suggestions. Service was also fast despite a reasonably impressive line early in the morning.

Definitely will be my go to for coffee the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Cartel is the bomb! One of my favorite spots in downtown! Amazing coffee, amazing service, and did I mention amazing coffee? I'll be back for sure! :-)"}
{"text":"Was stoked to see this little coffee shop while wandering PHX during a long layover.  The menu boards in the back showed Aeropress, Hario V60, Clever, and Chemex at MKT price, which was a definite surprise to see in an airport.

I ordered an Aeropress.  I was way too travel logged to really care about looking over their roasts, so went with the barista recommended Providencia.  Nice to see them doing an inverted brew on a gram scale, pre-moistening the paper filter, weighing out the water, and timing.  I didn't see them pre-warm the Aeropress, nor did they bloom the coffee.  Still, the coffee was solid, with a great nose (though maybe any coffee would have done the trick at that point in my travels), and worth the $3.25 market price.

I'm a little surprised to see most of those brewing techniques in a high-traffic, speed oriented, environment like an airport.  My coffee definitely took a while (as expected), but I can't imagine what this place must be like when slammed (I was the only customer at 7 PM on a Sunday evening).

Rad to have this option in an airport environment, and it's a shame I didn't have the time/energy to explore their roasts.  

Definitely worth the jaunt to Terminal 4 if you've got a layover in PHX . ."}
{"text":"This is a proper coffee shop and major ASU hangout. There's plenty of seating of all style: tables and chair, bar stools and some comfy chairs. In fact this is possibly one of the most spacious coffee places I've been to. As such you'll find a large number of people reading, working and studying here. 

The coffee is the main attraction: proper baristas, handmade, no attitude. Also easy parking. 

I wish they had more food items thigh, especially pastries in the morning."}
{"text":"Very expensive for what you get, the ambiance is weird and overly millennial focused. The barista was rude and very slow to make one cup of coffee. Will not return. One vanilla latte was $6! They only have vanilla and agave flavours to add to the coffee."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best coffee and pastries in Phx look no further. The honey latte here is by far my favorite as well as any cookie, or the salted caramel bar. The staff here really know their coffee, not to mention they are all really cool people as well. If you are in downtown make it a point to stop in !!!!"}
{"text":"Love this location! Perfect place to study. There's ample parking right in front and a free public parking garage nearby. There's also plenty of room to study inside. There's actually a back room with three tables (able to seat two people each) and two three seater couches). And then, there are tables in the little in between with another couch. So, you can't go wrong when it comes to space.

It's relatively quiet - patrons are either quietly chatting or doing their own work on their laptops."}
{"text":"I read about the 1 hr parking thing from other yelpers, and the dude who checks if you actually leave after an hr exists. I went into the parking lot in the back of Cartel Coffee Lab, and the guy (who's in a white shirt with \"parking security\" or whtever) was walking around with this pen and notebook in hand.

The inside of the coffee lab is pretty big. lots of tables to chill at. I had the cold brew, which was $2.50. It was pretty good. I would need to try other drinks they offer to better review them, but from what I experienced today, I wouldn't mind going again."}
{"text":"Definitely a very \"hipster\" atmosphere at this coffee shop located right by ASU Tempe campus. Music is playing at a pretty high volume, so I wouldn't recommend anyone who appreciates silence when studying. Lots of tables and outlets available for individual and group studies. I ordered an Iced Green Tea, priced at $3.75 (average coffee and tea shop pricing.) The employees are pretty relaxed. Totally would recommend anyone to stop by and check it out at least once!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I only came here because the other restaurants had long lines but this place didn't. There wasn't much of a selection of food to choose from, but the turkey sandwich I bought was really good. Service was A+, too"}
{"text":"One of the greatest cappuccinos I've ever had. Perfectly foamy, balanced coffee and milk flavors, & served at a temperature that allows you to enjoy it immediately without burning off your taste buds.

It's got trendy hipster vibe to it, I just wish they had later hours and a proper patio setting. 

I'll definitely be back to try out more of their menu as well as their beer."}
{"text":"This place is simple, secret, and sexy. Yeah Sexy. And the coffee is perfect. I get the hot mocha, and i love it! Also they have art for sale, and just an all over cool feel to the place. I only found it because i was getting pierced next door at HTC. Do yourself a favor and go get a piercing and some coffee :) You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I always enjoy grabbing an iced or hot vanilla latte at Cartel. Definitely one of the best places for baked goods, their banana bread is to die for! The staff is much friendlier here than the Tempe location. It's a wonderful atmosphere and when the weather is nice it's great to sit out on the patio."}
{"text":"after tommy v's happy hour, decided to walk to cartel for a little caffeine fix.  I ordered the chai tea latte with soy and i don't remember what Aileen ordered. the drinks come out with coffee art foam, nice touch.
i also had a sugar cookie and it was moist and yummy.  i might return if i was in the area but sorry i really enjoy starbucks espresso and i drink it at home in my machine all the time and starbuck's is close to home. overall a cute coffee spot to hang out."}
{"text":"Amazing. The only good thing about Phoenix airport.  But they be closing early..."}
{"text":"With a name like that, they ought to serve great coffee, and, they do. Despite not being a big fan of the hipster vibe, you will see me there every other week. The coffee, certainly, is a big draw.

We also buy coffee beans here to brew it fresh at home, and, the aroma lasts longer than they claim. 

While you are there, also try their coffee cake. Goes well with their cappuccino which (thankfully) they refuse to serve to go. Love their little snobby quirks!"}
{"text":"Cute place. Very laid back, great view anywhere you sit.  Im obsessed with the red chandelier :)))

The spicy chai latte was excellent. And the herbal tea was superb!!!"}
{"text":"Pour-over masters down to the last detail. During my entire stay in Phoenix, I couldn't wait to get back to the airport to get a cup."}
{"text":"This is a chill and fun coffeehouse that has some great drinks and snacks.  I tried the cowgirl cookie.  It has cranberries,  shaved coconut and white chocolate. I also tried the banana bread.  I like it because it has a natural taste and is not real sweet.  This is a great place to grab a coffee drink or a quick afternoon snack.   Plus,  there is a natural juice bar named Kaleidoscope in the same space for those who might not drink coffee."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite coffee shop in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Right in the middle of old Scottsdale. It has a cool vibe and is always busy--but not too. Excellent coffee and pastries. Comfortable seating inside and on an outdoor but covered patio. Great place to hang"}
{"text":"My ice latte ( light ice ) is delicious ! I wish I could capture this moment ! I had this similar ice latte in Brescia, Italy.  Be ware.  It's so hard to find this run down, old warehouse/ garage cafe. Once you're inside , it's uber cool spot to relax So glad that they didn't jack up the air conditioner !"}
{"text":"Hands down they have one of the best iced-chai that I've had! I strongly recommend it!
Everything is excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is great. 

It first caught my attention with the interesting name (maybe an homage to Columbian coffee?), followed by the unique modern/minimalist decor and bright green color scheme. 

I wanted a hot tea as I usually do, and figured this place would deliver Starbucks style - in a teabag - I was wrong, but let me get to that in a second.

The two guys manning this location were pretty hip looking for baristas - one of em took my order with an iPad mounted on this cool vertical swinging metal arm mount (which I later was told was made by the owner himself), swiped my card using a \"square\", and then flipped it over the iPad over to me to select my tip amount, sign with my finger, and choose where to send the receipt (email or print). I loved how seamless everything was, and that there were no clunky cash registers.

The barista told me it would take a few minutes for the tea to steep. He then proceeded to make my tea using loose leaf tea in this awesome single serve quick steeping device, which dispensed right into my cup, letting absolutely no tea leaves through. 

He then pointed me towards the condiments, and they had pure cane sugar syrup in a squirt dispenser so I didn't have to mess with trying to get the right amount of granular sugar and making a mess while doing it. 

The tea tasted great (I just had a standard English breakfast tea), and was strong - just the way I like it. 

For $3 at an airport, and at this level of quality, I was blown away by the value. I'll be stopping by here anytime I'm in PHX Terminal 4 in the C gates."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic coffee roaster down by C19.  Am I really at an airport?!  Who knew!  Cartel reminds me of Intelligentsia down on Abbott Kinney Blvd in Marina del Ray.  What a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Best Coffee Place in the city, if you care about brew temperature, precise grind, perfect foam, the exacting science behind why different coffee tastes differently and why details matter, this is your place

Be warned, it will ruin every other coffee place in the city for you, if you have been to Blue Bottle in San Fran you know what I am talking about"}
{"text":"After living in NYC for 5 years I got spoiled on great coffee and vibey coffee shops. Cartel hits the spot - the best in Scottsdale! If you haven't tried a cortado, stop what you are doing and go get one. I like to sweeten it with a pump of the simple syrup so I'm not a purist but it's hard to beat Cartel's cortados."}
{"text":"My favorite for a good latte! Pop tarts are delicious as well as the scones.  The staff is great not overly hyper just normal people delivering great service."}
{"text":"This is terminal 4 C wing.   To be honest, I wasn't expecting much and this place surprised me.   Legit coffee lab with different selection of beans.   I went with a cold coffee of the day since it was pretty darn hot in PHX and I wanted a low investment.   Pleasantly surprised.   Very similar you'd get in a trendy coffee bar.

Famous for: trendy coffee bar after the security line."}
{"text":"Drinking coffee from Cartel makes me want to get my own San Franciscan SF-25B Coffee Roaster, in much the same way I wanted my own pottery wheel after seeing the movie Ghost.

It's. That. Good."}
{"text":"I always feel like the oldest hipster when I'm there but it is a very nice place close to ASU.   I usually just get a cold brew with lots of room for cream and sugar. Coffee purists probably think that's terrible, but I like my drinks sweet. 

Came here with a friend who is in college and she thought it was pretty nice. There's plenty of room to sit and do homework if that's why you're there, or just hang out on one of the benches and chat.

The caffeine content in that cold brew however must've been pretty high because boy did I feel it afterwards!  I have been thinking of getting another one because it was so delicious and I'm glad I didn't. I would have been up all night. Either way the coffee is wonderful, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hi, I'd like a decaf iced Americano with a side of sorry I don't have tribal tattoos, gauges, and a pseudo-lumberjack beard.

In all seriousness, though, Cartel is a pretty cool place to hang out and get school work done, despite the fact that it may be too cool for school. The environment is open, spacious, and definitely the kind of place where I feel like I'm paying three bucks to park myself somewhere conducive to productivity for a few hours, rather than for the actual coffee. 

You might as well say \"make me a drink that's stronger than me,\" because that's essentially anything at Cartel. I'm sure it hurts so good if you're looking for a caffeine rush, but if you drink decaf, the high-intensity, bitter brew is basically like drinking an O'Doul's - neither effective, nor genuinely enjoyable. However, for the general college population, Cartel provides all the resources necessary to help you pound out that essay/assignment/tumblr post/article as seamlessly as possible."}
{"text":"Cartel, oh Cartel. Why must you reach so deeply into my pocket when all I want is a simple cup of coffee? I recognize that you're the King of the local coffee community, but why can't you consider the peasants? 

This was my first time in this location since they moved out of the space next door. I just wanted to spend a little time indoors reading my book, so I ordered a small Americano. 

Coffee: The coffee was good. It wasn't acidic like other drinks I'd ordered from different Cartel locations. My only complaint that it was a little on the cool side. The Americano came to $3.50. Not the most expensive cup of coffee I've ever had, but definitely on the pricier side, especially considering the simplicity of the drink. 

Service: The baristas were friendly and appreciative of the business. 

Ambiance: Why are the doors open in the Summer? It seems like such a waste of electricity. The building was a little warm because of this as well. Mind-boggling decision. 
Other than that, it was an open space, and could be described as industrial. There's cubicle-like seating, but it's not enclosed. It's just the right mix of privacy and openness. There are outlets at each spot. 

There's also a conference room which I'm going to assume you can book since there's a time-slot sign-in sheet attached to the door. 

It's not the cosiest coffee shop I've been in, but it's a place that I'll come to when I need to study."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars because I have hope. Since \"The Daily Grind\" closed I have been looking for a replacement for my occasional coffee/chai stop. I'm not one to resort to one of the BIG name shops. I prefer supporting the more local ventures. So I stopped in on my walk in to work the other morning. It was empty but I was eagerly greeted as I made my way to the counter. I ordered the large Americano, and waited. As I waited I enjoyed the simplicity of the shop. I didn't see any sweets or treats to go with my java, and then I look down to notice that the espresso machine had a part being held up by a plastic cup that had crushed under the weight of this part and water was dripping on the counter. And I continued to wait. No one was before me and no one right after... 
I finally got my coffee and went on my way. Served very hot, as far as the flavor, ehh the jury is still out. 
Several of my coworkers have also tried to give these guys a chance but they have commented on how long it takes to just get a regular cup o'joe. A few of my coworkers have also complained about the sizes offered (the small is pretty small and the large is only medium at the other places). They then are willing to wait in the long line at one of the BIG names. 
Again I have hope! I will give them at least 3 if not 4 tries...and we shall see...I would like to see them succeed."}
{"text":"I came to leave a raving review, but I'm now seeing that they have a happy hour?! This is something that I wasn't aware of (how embarrassing). I've been hitting up Cartel for the past few years, and I can honestly say I have not, and do not plan on buying beans from anywhere else. Their coffee is just solid amazing quality. I don't live in Old Town anymore, and if I ever wander down there, it's either to see friends or to buy more coffee beans from Cartel. I have tried a few of their pastries in the past as well, but I always get an iced latte and a bacon pretzel when I come. Bits of bacon jammed into a pretzel...what could be better?!

I've always found the service to be fast and extremely friendly, but parking can be a little tricky. There's lots of street parking, and a garage nearby, but in Old Town, that doesn't really mean much since it's always packed. Love this place though!"}
{"text":"It's allllllll about the brew baby. This place takes craaaazy amounts of thought and detail into the quality of your coffee. I truly can;t compare the taste and quality to anywhere, ever. Need one in north Scuzzydale. bring it on folks."}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop chain! I've never experienced a coffee bar like this before as their are so many creative things you can try. I had an iced agave latte and it was delicious! The staff was friendly and very communicative. The atmosphere is pleasant but the chairs are super uncomfortable which is why I gave four stars, but everything else about Cartel is great! Will be back!"}
{"text":"this place has the most amazing chai tea around.  they can be addicting so beware."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe, tasty coffee. My favorite place to sit and study or even a great spot for coffee dates. Hip atmosphere and friendly staff"}
{"text":"We were at a swim meet hosted at ASU.  I was distressed by the quality of the cafes near the aquatics center.  I needed to find better places.  Checking Yelp, I landed on Cartel.  It's great!

It's tucked away in a nondescript, not-so-grand strip mall.  I was hesitant to go in. But, the inside is hip and and has a great feel.

Most of the patrons seemed to be regulars, and the flow of road cyclists affirmed the local support.

They have choices on method:  Aeropress, Chemex, Hario and perhaps others.  Plus, they had about 6 bean choices.  About $4 for the Hario, and the coffee was excellent.  

Two thumbs up for Cartel.  This will be my go-to place in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"The staff was great but not so sure I could say the second about the drink I ordered. Perhaps it was too strong but the iced americano I ordered was extremely bitter that I threw it out after a couple of sips. I would like to give this place a second try but I'm debating it."}
{"text":"Go there a couple times a week now, and the place is fantastic.  My favorite drink by far to get there is now a Dirty Chai (Chai with a shot of espresso).  Sometimes if I am in the mood for something less sweet I will get just a Latte, or a little less heavy I will get a regular chai.  Everything I have gotten has been great though.

The environment is laid back, and definitely somewhere I would lazily sip my drink over a game of chess if it was closer to home.  It is close to work though, so it is always an in and out run to pickup a pick-me-up."}
{"text":"Love this  place. I am big supporter of local coffee spots amd have been to each location. Every time at each location I get great coffee and good service."}
{"text":"It was already scorching hot here in AZ and I wanted to stop at the Coffee shop for an ice cold drink.  I just got into town and my friend was driving into Scottsdale area.  
I looked up the coffee places on Yelp on my phone and luckily found several Coffee shops on 5th Ave.  
I'm glad I walked into this place out of many Coffee shops in the neighborhood after having their tasty **cookies(Chocolate/Peanut/Bacon & White Chocolate/ Macadamia) and a delicious **Chai iced latte w/soy milk :P. Their Chai iced latte was one of the best I've ever tried before!!

It's a \"trendy\" coffee shop type of place. When I walked in, there were several people  sit around either working on their laptops or reading books.  I really like their very modern style of mismatched colorful furniture.  I enjoy the chalkboard menus on the wall as well.  It seems like they serve quiet a few selection of beers and foods:)  To my surprise and amazement, they had an alcohol beverage and keep in mind, this is a coffee shop. Most notable Wow, I would never thought this place might sell beer... 

A place to come and do some work on your laptop sipping coffee and then transition to beers later in the day-sounds awesome!!  Maybe some people might think it doesn't look exactly a beer destination place, but I can see myself having a glass of cold beer on a hot summer night :P.  Definitely, it's a relaxing spot to enjoy a pint, or less in my case.

Don't forget., thumbs up for the Chai Latte!"}
{"text":"Baristas were super helpful at explaining the menu and the differences in options, and I LOVED the espresso. It's a super cool place with different rooms connected by the ordering area where they prepare the coffee and food. Great for studying or just hanging out with friends. They also have beer on tap which is super unique! Would definitely come back here again and try some more great coffee"}
{"text":"It was like I walked into a episode of Portlandia - from the in-depth narrative of how they make their clover coffee to the description of the special bakery where they get their muffins.  That being said, the staff were very nice, the atmosphere was great and the (clover) coffee was fantastic."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the worst latte I've ever had. It was very sour and inedible."}
{"text":"Any place that periodically offers Bacon Chocolate Chip Cookies gets 5 stars in my book! While doing some heavy studying I decided I needed a coffee place to go to besides Starbucks because I was getting so sick of it. So, I was in Tempe one day and searched for coffee places and decided to give Coffee Cartel a try. Let's just say....I'm now addicted! I want it everyday! They have the best mochas ever, hands down. And their cookies are to die for. mmmm...

I was a bit intimidated before I walked in because I had no idea what to expect. The building is in the back of the parking lot, no windows really and is just very inconspicuous. I walked in and the place was pretty packed. There are tables for people to sit at in groups of 4, some random chairs, even a hair dryer chair you see at the salon, and then two long tables with lots of outlets for computers. I love outlets!!!! The decor is very urban, concrete floors, open ceiling, garage door in the back. I loved it. Music is definitely not 'coffee-shop' music, but contemporary and up beat. Loved it as well!  

In the days  I spent there studying I got mochas, a few cookies and their dirty chai. I had no complaints about any of them. The mochas were actually pretty amazing and so were the cookies. 

If you haven't been here, give it a try. It just has an awesome atmosphere and equally awesome coffee and snacks."}
{"text":"Walking by and the culture of this little coffee place caught my eye. The name is super catchy !!! Can't wait to try there coffee!!!!! I wish they had one of these in the Inland Empire !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cartel has really good coffee and tea, super loud music, lots of thigh tattoos, and a slow, overpopulated wifi network. In-your-face progressive, with bicycle wheels and local art. I find it charming & welcoming. Plenty of places to sit, not all of them are comfortable. I recommend it as a gateway to west Tempe."}
{"text":"Passionate, knowledgable, and excellent! BUT... It probably isn't for everyone. If you are looking for the best craft coffee in AZ, the. Cartel is the probably the place to go. The issue is that they tend to stay away from dark roasts. So if you are someone who just loves a classic cup of bold, nutty coffee. This place isn't for you. Also they don't do a zillion flavored drinks. The only flavored stuff that have is mocha's and vanilla latte's. So if you are someone who loves Carmel Frappacino's, this place isn't for you. But If you love perfectly crafted espresso or black coffee, then it's the best in town!"}
{"text":"Seriously. 
It just doesn't get any better. No matter the time of day, the quality of product here is beyond anything you could find outside of an airport even though it's inside the airport....
Cartel- don't sell out to the big boys, instead just franchise in airports. Pretty please. You are setting the new standards!"}
{"text":"I loved this place and the double-soy-cappuccino was one of the best I have ever tasted.  The Cap was made perfectly... awesome thick foam, tasty coffee, great cup (haha, srsly, the cup is great).  The inside is filled with art and has a cool vibe.  $2.50 for a double-soy-cap, not bad.  I just wish this place was closer to me, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"It was just kinda meh. The coffee wasn't the best that I've ever had. The service wasn't anything special. I tried to come here to do some class work and couldn't get wifi in some parts of the store."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best coffee shop in Arizona. I have been coming to the 5th Ave location for 3 years now. The baristas are like family and they treat their family right! It took all of the baristas no more than 3 trips from me before they knew what I wanted and had it ready by the time it was my turn to pay. As I always state, attention to detail is what sets a business apart and Cartel is fully focused on the details.

They boast a strong pastry section with the chocolate chip cookie, my favorite, leading the way. They will accommodate any order and always have fun facts about the great coffee you're about to enjoy. They have all the best methods of brewing including the Chemex.

The one thing that sets them above all other coffee shops, besides the coffee and pastries, is the music. They are always playing the coolest playlists and they don't discriminate. I have heard everything from 2Pac to The xx to 80s jams. 

After studying for 3 Bar Exams here, I can truly say there is no better place to get your coffee fix while enjoying great music and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am a tea drinker. They offer a nice and unusual selection of tea...I had the qimen. It was good but not great.

Issue..they brewed in a  tea sac and it was not enough tea for the cup size. Result was  tea not strong enough amd was messy. For this price it should be pot brewed and then poured or at least provide as an option. Especially with so much science for coffee this was a poor excuse for a real cup of brewed tea. They can do better I know and hope they will.

Also the bar stools were cute since they mimicked those found in Chem class but they are terribly uncpmfortable with too small seats. 

Otherwise very helpful barrista and a fun concept plavce."}
{"text":"Nice, quaint location here at the Sky Harbor Airport in the Southwest terminal. Got a small cold brew. Nice flavor and just strong enough for an evening drink before heading home on a delayed flight. Paired it with a peanut butter cookie I got in Downtown Phoenix at the open air market on Saturday. This combination was a good pairing.

Liked that they had simple syrup out. I'm not a big fan of packaged sweetener anymore. Maybe I'm lazy, maybe it's the unnecessary packaging, or that I hate that sugar doesn't melt well in a cold beverage. It still is a plus for me. Thank you Cartel for my little beverage that brought a smile with my cookie."}
{"text":"Great coffee for the coffee snobs out there! Nice atmosphere, and great quality of products. It isn't wonderfully signed though, but once you find it, you're set! I always order a dirty iced chai...yum! Great for coffee shop working too, they have free wi fi and lots of places to sit down and get some work done."}
{"text":"Super cute coffee shop! My iced vanilla latte was great, and they had almond milk which was perfect too.  They also have good looking pastries too if you need a quick bite! Very reasonable prices, friendly staff, and PLENTY of seating! Indoors, outdoors, I'd be surprised if you came here and couldn't find seat! They have a side patio and a back room behind the ordering counter. 
Haven't had any of the beer or wine, but I love the idea of mixing coffee shop and bar lounge, creates a sweet atmosphere for whatever youre feeling!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I have been to Cartel many more times and discovered something a little strange. Their hot lattes are almost always very good.... BUT their iced lattes are really bad. I don't know how this is possible, but I do not like their iced lattes at all. Sad day for them. I still like that it's bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside and the vibe of the place is nice, but I am disappointed in this finding. They do have decent toddy and they have good chocolate croissants...mmmm. I will still come here, but maybe more often in the winter."}
{"text":"I met a friend at Cartel in Scottsdale yesterday. It is smaller than the other two locations, but comfortable. The coffee is the same, good, not my favorite in town, but good. The girl who was working yesterday was awesome, very friendly and we had a nice conversation. The decor has a similar vibe to the downtown location, modern....not as 'cool' as the Tempe location, but nice with a lot of community style tables. I would definitely recommend this shop over some of the other Scottsdale options!"}
{"text":"Since my first visit, Cartel has significantly expanded this location without compromise.  The Tempe location, conveniently close to the campus, offers a great environment to study/hang out. I really enjoy the cold brew, hot teas, and the chai tea. It's always a good time!"}
{"text":"I was passing through Phoenix airport and felt like having some green tea so decided to try Cartel Coffee Lab instead of grabbing a bottle of Snapple or PureLeaf from the freezer.

I asked for the Iced green tea ($3.75) and requested it with milk and sugar. I was told there was milk and a bottle of syrup on the counter which I could help myself with. This was a \"tell\" that I choose to ignore so paid the price. The barista simply poured out a measure of pre-brewed green tea from a jug into a cup and was done. I added some milk and sugar to complete my masterpiece. As expected it turned out to me bad. I was better off getting a bottle of Snapple iced tea rather than be subjected to this.

Next time will head to a Starbucks where the baristas actually know measures and proportions to make a decent green tea instead of coming to Cartel Coffee Lab."}
{"text":"Cartel has exceptional coffee, no doubt about it. I came in today looking forward to a  latte and a breakfast burrito... Only to discover they've stopped serving all of their breakfast and lunch menus. The devastation! 

There's nothing worse than when you've chosen to treat yourself and you're looking forward to something (while being \"hangry\" already) only to learn that it's no longer available. I opted to a get my usual drink and decided to try a blueberry muffin. The muffin was dry and hard. There wasn't any music on in the entire place, and the gal behind the counter may have needed to drink some coffee herself. Service was incredibly slow and she barely even smiled. Overall, a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"This is my regular coffee joint so be prepared for a totally biased review. 

I was drowning in a sea of Starbucks before Cartel came and saved my life. Now, instead of drinking Daniel Plainview-approved office sludge I can skip three blocks and belly up at Cartel's friendly bar, continue working using their reliable Wi-Fi, and chat up friendly staff and regulars while enjoying to-die-for drips. And now that Adam Reeder's kitchen is cranking out Digby plates and Downtown's best tuna sandwich (for best results, place the potato chips ON the sandwich) Cartel is able to meet your needs for breakfast and lunch. Check out their afternoon pastry happy hour and get tasty cookies (made daily by Adam's sister) for half-price.

Hopefully one day in Downtown's near future we can support a place like Cartel enough that they can stay open for dinner and on weekends. 

Dare to dream."}
{"text":"Totally hippie atmosphere. Like hippie atmosphere on crack. Obsessed with the iced horchata latte,Amazing!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent craft coffee roaster in Tempe, located very close to the ASU campus. Would highly recommend it, and I will definitely return if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Just had some coffee that I didn't like at all. I'll stick with their teas. Not sure if all their coffee is this way, or just the one ai had."}
{"text":"Not open in the evening or on Friday and Saturday night. Nothing like a good coffee after the theater or the symphony. But not in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Arizona's best coffee shop.... Love the chill vibes.  Delicious pastries, Country Girls Cookie is my favorite..."}
{"text":"Cartel is in my top 3 third wave coffee shops in the country (I've visited well over 100 in over 25 states). The shop is awesome, decorated very hip, and there's tons of room. They roast their own beans and their roasters know what they're doing. 

The best part is, I've been here over 10 times and my drinks are perfect each time. I drink their cortado, americano, cold brew and drip. I don't ruin the coffee with cream or sugar, so I expect full, delicious flavors  naturally extracted from the beans. Cartel never fails to provide the perfect coffee. 

Im shocked that they are at 4 stars. This is a 5 star coffee shop through and through."}
{"text":"One Note- A busy, best coffee, college students popularity tucked in the corner of the strip. 

On  the Yelp app, it says breakfast/sandwiches, but it was more of a few baked goods and coffee. We went on a Saturday morning around 10:00 a.m. and ordered two mochas and a fresh blueberry muffin. The blueberry muffin was great- a perfect homemade tasting morning snack. Wait time was forever- but as we left, we noticed the line to be huge. We waited 20 minutes (or so it seemed) for our coffee's. 

There is some talent to the barista's, as they take their time- which I appreciated by the taste of coffee and kind service. They also brew their own coffee and mix it with liquor? Not sure of the concept- but it's cool- so I'm glad my husband and I checked it out. Many college students were gathered in a comfy corner- some with books and partly studied, some to chit chat. 

Don't come if you're not going to be patient and want your coffee fast or if you want a place to sit immediately. Otherwise, definately check it out if you're in town."}
{"text":"Found the coffee to be bitter and burnt tasting and the staff on the unfriendly hipster and arrogant side. Bought a poptart that was cold and not very tasty and was refused a warm over."}
{"text":"Coffee Cartel is more of an artsy coffee place where they take the quality and appearance of their drinks very seriously.  It will take a bit to get your coffee because they use a slower process.  Their coffees are very strong and dark and rich with flavor.  If you're looking for a quick and convenient cup of coffee, this isn't it."}
{"text":"This place caught my eye because they have an outdoor walk up window to order a coffee to go. I decided to check out the inside and everything has such a nice and clean feel. I love the way they show the different types of espresso drinks with symbols to represent how much milk is included in each one. The barista was very friendly and welcoming. He recommended the mocha as it has a nice dark chocolate. I ordered an iced mocha and it was delicious."}
{"text":"AMAZING COFFEE! I love the location and the atmosphere. Great meeting spot or quick stop to grab coffee."}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying I love coffee and I always try to find somewhere besides Starbucks to spend my dollars. I got a mocha to go and it was finished expediently. The ambiance is nice here as the building is quite open. The barista and the girl at the register were friendly. The mocha was strong and tasty. I would definitely recommend stopping here for your morning cup of joe."}
{"text":"Always awesome. Quiet areas to sit and have conversations. They also serve liqueur so if that's your thing.. well have at it! It is a cool vibe that matches Tempe's cool jive. I just wish they had more cartel coffees in the East Valley.."}
{"text":"The chai I had was too sweet and gross, and way too expensive. I've had drinks from other Cartels before that were coffees that I swear were better. We got our drinks to-go, so this is the experience I have to go off of. My boyfriend's mocha was pretty good from the sip I had of it."}
{"text":"Must try the homemade pop tart.

Arizona needs to get on the Hemp milk craze! Seattle knows about it, Los Angeles is getting there, now Phoenix needs to learn."}
{"text":"I waited until I had a few visits to review Cartel.

Firs and foremost, great coffee. I have ordered lattes, chai, dirty chai, and the cold brew (toddy). All have been delicious. The ratio with the chai/milk is pretty spot on and the cold brew is fantastic. They also have a decent pour over menu that changes every few months. 

The staff have always been very nice and helpful. Prices seem to be a tinsy bit high but the coffee is tasty so I keep going back. 

Give it a shot, you'll love the drinks."}
{"text":"Can we talk about how amazing Cartel's coffee is but how horrible their customer service is? Probably will never go to this location again. Wish they had online ordering so I wouldn't have to talk to their employees."}
{"text":"Told me outright that what I wanted (one shot latte) would be 'disgusting' and that I should just get the double shot. I asked politely if they could just pour half the double shot and she responded with 'I guess'. Also, the chia parfait was not delicious, I could barely eat any. I can eat my fair shake of airport food, but never again will I go to this place."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom.  Great lattes. I like the vibe of the phx location--very chill."}
{"text":"Great local grinds! Nice, unique shop with an amazing product. Awesome brew and they offer growlers to go as well. The Pop Tarts are a must try as well."}
{"text":"As stated in previous reviews, their no bullshit menu is awesome. They seem to have hired the friendly hipsters that are not snobs(also one of their baristas is a mountain biker, which is nice to see in the sea of tempe fixsters). The coffee is delicious (easily rivals Lux or Orange Table). The to-go cups are environmentally friendly which makes me eager to spend my money there.

Bonus: Superchuck was playing on the stereo last time I was there."}
{"text":"Love the cold brew (toddy). The service, and the coffee, is always solid."}
{"text":"I was shocked and delighted to stumble upon this wonderful coffee stand on my way home from Phoenix - I had already enjoyed coffee at the main Cartel Coffee location in Scottsdale (http://www.yelp.com/biz/cartel-coffee-lab-scottsdale) several times and was so happy I had one more chance to snag a cup of well made coffee before leaving. And at an airport, no less! The only other airports I've been to that offered palatable espresso options were in Australia (seriously, every coffee in Australia is 'good' coffee). 

If you find yourself flying through Terminal 4 in Phoenix, definitely pop over to gate C19 to enjoy a delicious and expertly pulled espresso drink before leaving the airport."}
{"text":"Absolutely killer place. Excellent cortado during our last visit to town. Followed by a nice macchiato today. Great music and atmosphere. Well worth the visit for the rest of the out of towners wondering where their best opportunity for exceptional espresso and espresso based drinks can be found. Small but awesome beer selection on tap and limited wines too. Glad they stop there though. No one can be the jack of all."}
{"text":"Had to try to squeeze in one last fix before leaving town. And to see if the airport version could compare to the in town. Not a bit of disappointment here. Excellent macchiato. Staff is super friendly. Nice to see a REAL barista in the airport. One with skills... And cares about what she is doing. Great job again Cartel!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely where you should get your coffee when flying Southwest in Phoenix!  Skip the Starbucks at security and head over to this place right closest to gate C12, you'll be glad you did.  I haven't tried many things here but the latte with almond milk is strong and smooth, a rare combination.  I actually put half has much splenda in one of these as I normally would in a Starbucks of similar size to get the right sweetness.  Course the almond milk adds some sweetness over soy milk at other places.  Even if you normally order your coffee with dairy milk, give the almond a try, its really good.

As other reviews have said, they take their time, so I'd there's a line, don't expect to be out of there in 2 minutes, but it's really worth it.  If its not overly busy, then it is no problem though.  Great start to a flying day, thanks Cartel!"}
{"text":"I was in downtown Phoenix headed for jury duty and missing my breakfast when my eye caught Cartel Coffee Lab.  I stopped in and tried a scone with asiago cheese and zuccini, which was fabulous.  Their coffee is excellent, too.  However, the service was the best.  The barista was very friendly and when he found out that I was doing jury duty and not 100% sure I knew where the courthouse was, he looked it up on a maps app and gave me great directions.  I didn't get much of a chance to stay, but the clean lines of their decor still gave off a warm, homey vibe and I REALLY appreciated the fact that music was not blaring like at SOME coffee store franchises and their A/C was not designed to freeze people out."}
{"text":"I had a coffee and met with a friend. I parked in the parking lot next to the shop at 7. It said 1 hour parking. There was not any clear signs where to park if I thought I may park longer than an hour. I came out to a warning on my car informing me that my information had been recorded and that if it happened again, my car could be towed or a boot applied. I went in and asked a staff member to relay my concern to management/ownership that I didn't appreciate the security people pouncing on my car the minute I parked over despite the fact that there were plenty of open spots. The staff member was rude and condescending and told me that there was nothing he could do. I reiterated that I did not expect him to do anything other than relay the concerns of a customer that the business's parking lot security had made the whole visit very unejoyable. The staff member flatly refused and and directed me to complain to the security company. I tried to explain that the business has more weight with the lessor and its security company than me, as is evidenced by the growth of the business's leased property over the years. But he refused. I walked away, frustrated that the treatment of the staff member had been more rude and condescending than the actual security guy who wrote the warning. As I walked out, the staff member said loudly and also in a condescending sarcastic  voice, \"have a good evening\".  Perhaps ownership of this company seeks rude arrogant staff to continue its image as hipster hell.  If you like being talked down to and laughed at by staff, consider this place."}
{"text":"I had herbal tea which was brewed fresh and was wonderful also an americano which was very smooth and not bitter
Cute local spot to check out"}
{"text":"Very quick in this more hip chilled environment. I was quickly asked to take my order only to reply \"its my 1st time here im not sure\". The staff quickly filled me on the beans, where they are roasted, blends etc. It was actually quite informative for an airport coffee service, much better then any commercial coffee service I frequent. The barista asked me a few questions as my java was brewed up making the experience much more enjoyable. 
Bottom line, I'm sad this business is not in my home town but will certainly be a regular stop anytime I'm in Phx Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"First time here. I work from home so I try to venture out. These guys were on my list today. I'm not a true coffee drinker, so my pallet is pretty narrow. They have all light roasts and they suggested I get a regular latte. I needed to sweeten it because it was pretty bitter. I'm guessing I may be a dark roast girl? I also had a cow girl cookie. It was pretty good, but I wouldn't order it again. The atmosphere is lively. Lots of people talking. The music is a little loud, but it may just seem loud as indie rock really isn't my genre. There is a lot of table space for working. You don't feel like you're sitting on top of the person next to you. There is a row of padded benches, but no other comfy chairs. All in all, I'm glad I tried it, but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Cartel is a fun little place to go when you have one of the following:

crazy caffeine craving
writing on your to do list (you must own headphones)
hipster withdrawals
a need for a place that serves coffee and beer
you want a snarky letter for abusing the one hour parking (Sorry, Cartel)

All told, I really enjoy this spot. I will definitely be back--but I will park down the street..."}
{"text":"After having been to some other locations, this one lived up to the consistency I expected. The staff was friendly, qualify of drinks great, and I LOVE how much space is available. Great for grabbing a quick drink, having a meeting, or hanging out with friends.

Longer-term parking (more than 1 hour) is a bit unclear, but that typically goes for the whole of Tempe."}
{"text":"Yum. Do yourself a favor and skip the normal Starbucks garbage and come here.  Cartel crafts wonderful drinks in which you can really taste the espresso and the roasting itself. Im enjoying a mocha latte currently and it. Is. Bangin. If youre connecting through phx sky harbor and you are flying southwest, you should stop."}
{"text":"Cool theme for a coffee shop but nothing to write home about. The house cold press coffee I had was mediocre. They advertise four different ways to brew your coffee, however dont really provide a variety of different coffee blends to customize your brew. Overall, cool theme, ok coffee."}
{"text":"This coffee shop was just okay. I enjoyed the vibe, with all the metal and bicycle decorations, but finding seating was scarce.

My best friend and I took up two whole couches next to each other when we had the chance since we had a few others joining.

I like that they serve coffee and beer. Best friend had an Espresso Excelente, which was tasty. It had horchata, espresso, and cinnamon in it. I just had a soy latte which was nothing to write home about.

I could not for the life of me find sweetener anywhere. No sugar, no simple syrup. Nothin'. And my latte sorely needed it.

Customer service was good, though. Clientele seems mostly college-aged kiddos doing homework."}
{"text":"I love this place! It reminds me of a really good local coffee house you would find in the PNW. This is how good coffee should taste. Not like the crappy sugar-laden faux-dessert McCoffee at Starbucks. These hipster dufuses (dufii?) at Cartel take their coffee seriously! I find myself routing my travel via PHX these days for my coffee fix. Tip: try the mocha. You won't regret it. Tell them I sent you. That and $5.25 will get you a large mocha. Best. Mocha. Ever."}
{"text":"Outstanding coffee.  Very yummy cookies available.   Great coffeehouse atmosphere. 
It's a bit hard to find - no big obvious sign... this isn't Starbucks."}
{"text":"Overall I'd say Cartel is good not great. It's very trendy and I'm convinced that some of my friends on social media only go there so they can post a cool picture showing they're studying in a coffee shop. The coffee is good; however, if you really want study or get some work done it is pretty loud and there aren't many comfortable places to sit. If you're in the vicinity I recommend trying it because they do have solid drinks."}
{"text":"I feel weird reviewing this place because I don't like coffee and well, it's a coffee shop.  However, I did try the green tea.  The tea was good but came out nearly boiling hot.  I thought it was cool that they used fresh tea leaves (they didn't look dried... but I could be wrong).  I had to wait quite a while before it was a temperature where I could safely drink it.  It was a cold rainy day when we went and they had left all the doors open for some reason so it was so chilly inside.  The furniture and decor is all industrial, with plywood walls and benches and metal stools, not very comfy in my opinion.  I love to support local businesses, but I doubt I would be back unless someone else wanted to go here."}
{"text":"Hipster hole in the wall....so THIS is where the unemployed miscreants of Phoenix hide out and pretend they're somebody. 

Found this place via Yelp, looking for that hard to find Starbucks alternative in Phoenix. We came in through the back door, which was what....a dirty college dorm where some guys were working on their home brew? Co-Op shared space? Soapbox derby car manufacturing??? What?

Oh...Coffee is served in the OTHER side. Beer dudes made a snarky motion to the counter on the other side of the sea of dirty R.E.M tshirts. Ok. My coworker and I were in work uniform, which by the looks from some of the patrons, both confused them and bothered them. Doth my white collar employment offend you? 

Ordered a dried out, tasteless scone and a cappuccino and was told it could not be served in a \"to go\" paper cup. No reason or explanation. This was NOT a place I wanted to stay and drink my coffee. I needed daylight & fresh air, not some wannabe hippie's feet propped up next to my table while he played Mahjong. 

Sat in misery and quickly drank my cappuccino so I could get the F on outta there. I will add this to the long list of places not to come back to. Also to the list of places that try too hard. Yuck."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee.... they brew each cup fresh. Cute little spot in the heart of oldtown. The Las Vegas coffee was amazing. Nice and strong! The Baristas are super friendly. Good vibe."}
{"text":"When looking for a 3rd wave coffee shop, read Yelp reviews. If the reviews include phrases like:

- the coffee wasn't hot enough
- the employee staff were rude and insulting
- they refused to make me a large cappuccino, or a cappuccino to go...
- they over-charge for their coffee
- There is no carmel macchiato

GET IN THERE, because the coffee is going to be excellent!

I was visiting from the SF Bay Area and Lux in Central Phoenix was a little too far this time.  Cartel's Tempe location was more convenient so I thought I'd give it a try.  

Great coffee, regardless of the incessant employee smuggery.   Come on people, it is what it is.  It's the price you pay for good coffee.  Think \"Soup Nazi - Seinfeld\" get in line, be patient, and enjoy what you can.

Please don't compare this kind of coffee experience to Starbucks or other commercial establishments because it is going to be different.  You aren't going to have it your way, you're going to have it the correct way :)"}
{"text":"I might be very demanding about this, but I still cannot find a good cappuccino in town. I tried it here but it was just disappointing, (not disgusting) but just not good enough to be called cappuccino. 
I give three stars to the service, which is, excellent and attentive. I might just get a regular coffee next time..."}
{"text":"i'm a socialphobe so the fact that you couldn't get the cappuccino to go was a little disheartening but also slightly humorous. especially after reading the sign on the wall about it. anyway, my gf got the capp and i got the chai latte. holy sh*t! i have never had a chai like that before. that milk was insanely creamy. hands down, best i have ever had. the capp was good but i don't know if it is worth torturing myself over. if we can get the latte to go ( which i think you can), than that will work perfect. for sure, blows away any coffee chain. and for me, the best i have ever had. the staff was super friendly. and the side bar where you can watch from was pretty neat."}
{"text":"Use is the best review; I am in Cartel around 5 times per week.

The coffee can't be beat. They roast their own beans in house (that's what the giant locomotive-looking thing in the corner is) and grind the beans immediately before preparing each hot coffee or espresso. They use the Clover coffee brewing machine, which brews each cup of coffee individually and automatically. Their iced coffee is a concoction called Toddy, which I like to call \"crack\" because of its high caffeine content and extremely economical price. This is cold-brewed for 24 hours and is also delicious. So short of starting their own coffee plantation in their backyard, Cartel has the entire process - roasting to grinding to brewing - in-house, while most other coffeeshops only handle the grinding and brewing aspects. There is something to be said for freshly roast coffee, I just can't say it because my fingers are flying across the keyboard too fast.

Their selection of coffees is amazing. At S------s, I could never tell the difference between their coffee varieties, and was skeptical that any difference could actually exist in that kind of corporate environment. Cartel puts them to shame with the multiplicity of flavors found in one cup of Huehuetenango (Guatemalan), much less their Brazilian, Salvadorian, and (new) Ethiopian varieties. Best of all many are direct-trade and organic, meaning they come from a farmer that the owners of Cartel have personally met and made a deal with.

The atmosphere is fantastic as long as you can drop out of the speedy American mindset - and if you don't mind the more generic side of indie/pop rock. Come here for a date, a long computing session (free wifi), or to relive your European café experience - the coffee might even be better."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Had a vanilla latte and split one of their amazing homemade poptarts. Didn't take too long for us to get our drinks like some of the other reviews said. Keep in mind we came here on a Sunday morning at that. The people who worked there also seemed really nice. Nice ambiance inside with lots of seating split between two rooms. Definitely a nice place too come and chat with friends over good coffee."}
{"text":"I've visited several times - the coffee and pastries are fine.  My issue is with the staff.  I normally pay in cash - but twice now I've had to request my change back.  I usually tip - but the decision to tip is mine - not the staff's'.  I shouldn't have to request my change back."}
{"text":"First of all, let me state that I completely love Cartel. There's only two reasons that keep me from giving them 5 stars: the difficult to find location and the crappy wifi. Honestly, if the wifi rocked, that would probably be enough for me.

I call Cartel the \"accidental coffeehouse\". It started off as a roasting operation with a small espresso/retail component. Thanks to the ridiculously high quality of their coffee, they grew into a full-fledged coffeehouse.

The coffee Cartel roasts and brews is consistently some of the best in the valley. I am in love with their Black Market Espresso, which is a favorite of mine both at the shop and in the office when I brew my own.

Cartel provides all of the standard espresso beverages as well as iced toddy. However, they don't do any of the foofy blended drinks. Not only do I appreciate their commitment to classic coffee drinks, I also enjoy the freedom from hearing an insanely loud blender when I'm attempting to have a conversation.

There's also a couple of less common brewing methods available at Cartel. They have pour-over brewers which brew single cups. This enables them to offer any of their beans as fresh brewed coffee. Also, they have a Clover machine, which brews single cups on demand.

I do wish that Cartel served some pastries or other food, but Cartel is unabashedly committed to coffee, so I can't fault them for this.

The vibe at Cartel is a great mix of bohemian eclectic, which fits their proximity to ASU's main campus. The largely windowless interior makes it a great place to take refuge from the often brutal Arizona sun and enjoy a drink or two while hanging out with friends or getting work done.

Overall, Cartel is an excellent addition to the Phoenix coffee scene."}
{"text":"Their espresso is absolutely the best. Every single barista that's made my latte has foamed the soy perfectly. Small, thick, creamy bubbles. I used to slang coffee, and I know. Small, thick, creamy soy bubbles. Most places don't steam it correctly, but Cartel? They're consistent and quite friendly. 

Usually they've got a pretty decent selection of tunes going, and I'm happy they're not afraid to play it loud."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this location for a while, having wanted to explore more coffee options than just Starbucks and I had heard this place mentioned more than a few times. Stepping in the atmosphere is entirely different and welcoming. With a nice modern industrial design and a clean lobby. The coffee and espresso drinks are top notch and where before I could only take coffee with plenty of sugar and cream now with them I don't need any of that. They've opened my tastebuds up to how good coffee can actually be. So if you're reading this and want to expand your tastes away from quick cheap coffee give Cartel a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cool coffee shop in downtown Phoenix. I like Cartel Coffee but it's not my favorite. A good spot to do meetings, but I feel the hot coffee is overpriced and can be as bitter as Starbucks. A lot of people like their hot coffee, but I don't find it that great. They do have good Iced coffee and the snacks are good but also kind of overpriced."}
{"text":"Refused to give me a cappuccino to go. Don't be snotty. I'm a coffee snob myself. If I want a cappuccino in a to go cup, make it. Thanks for making me wait in line for nothing."}
{"text":"Aw, Cartel. You've won yourself a spot in my cold, dead heart: Better hours, better setup, better everything. You have achieved (near) perfection. 

Plus, now that it's fall and the weather's cooled down, I can ride my bike right up to the big garage-style warehouse door in the back. Like the cool kids.

And even though I'm not actually cool, the baristas here are really nice. Hipster style without the hipster pretension. I like it. 

Perhaps most of all, I just plain started feeling guilty about giving three stars to a place I frequent at least twice a week. And as I have said before, guilt's a bitch. 

Now that I'm absolved of my sins, I think it's time for some coffee."}
{"text":"This is a good spot to get good coffee, the smell of the fresh coffee is right on. There is a lot of room in this place so it's good for meetings and the sound isn't overbearing that you can't study."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time on Monday, as a place to work and get out of the house. Immediately when I walked in, I was afraid I wasn't cool enough to be there. I confirmed this when I shot the liquid sugar across my latte and all over the counter. 
The redeeming quality of Cartel is the barista working responded with, \"I shot myself in the face with that, last week.\" Making yourself more embarrassing than your clients? Point Cartel.
The latte was really good, pretty strong, and tasted really good. The free wifi didn't hurt, and although I know I wasn't really cool enough to be there (I'm pretty sure I was one of 3 people that wasn't wearing clothes they made), it was just what I was looking for. Quiet, but not dull, and good coffee. 
Oh, and when I was leaving, the barista said \"Sweet bag!\" (Mine, that I design and sell). Yep okay. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally find a place that served quality iced Toddy coffee in Arizona. This place has a great vibe, and great coffee products. It's a smaller location than the original in Tempe, but still a great place to meet, get some work done, or just hangout.

Iced coffee is a must in the hot Arizona heat, so if you haven't had iced Toddy coffee before then you MUST go here and get some."}
{"text":"Finally found great Toddy coffee in AZ! I moved away from AZ to Austin for 6 months, and I love all the local businesses out there including their coffee shops. I discovered iced toddy coffee out there, and I have been searching for the same thing since I've been back in AZ for months. Well, I found it here at Cartel Coffee Lab, and it's some of the best I've ever tasted!

Additionally, I think I'm part of the majority of people that is sick of Starbucks, but the convenience of them being on every corner is hard to avoid. \"Ugh I don't want Sturbucks, but I'm going there anyway....\" How many people have done that?!? Cartel Coffee Lab is worth the extra 10 minute drive, or planning your day/route to work it in. All the different coffees I've tried are excellent, the staff is great, and they have a great relaxed but still energetic atmosphere.

It's a great place to just grab a coffee, meet a friend, have a one-on-one business meeting or get locked in by yourself for a while."}
{"text":"Cartel is my favorite coffee shop to visit when doing homework before I head into work.  It is close to my place of work, the giant State Farm buildings off of Rio Salado, and they always have a great selection of food and beverages.  I frequently order the Rotating Cold Brew because I like trying the variety of beans they get in.  Since I go pretty early in the morning, roughly between 7am and 8am, I don't run into any issues with parking or business.  Their wifi is terrific and I have yet to run into an issue with connectivity.  Lastly, my favorite aspect of this coffee shop is their inclusiveness.  If you enter the door that faces East on Ash Ave, you'll be welcomed by a sign showing their acceptance of all people letting everyone know they are welcomed.  Thanks for being an amazing shop Cartel!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice to hang out, especially in the winter with their patio. They're known for good coffee but have a small selection of beer on tap. Friendly baristas too."}
{"text":"Best Americano ever had
They somehow managed to steam the milk perfectly to the point where you could taste the milk and not have the americano overpower.
I didn't order with sugar or flavors and if I could have this everyday served like this"}
{"text":"Great coffee great people, not for the Starbucks crowd, there is no frapuccinos or sugary drinks here just great coffee. Place is a little hard to find on a side street on ash and university"}
{"text":"Walk over to Cartel at least 3 times a week from work and love it. My office sits right in between a Starbucks and Cartel. I don't even hesitate to move towards Cartel. The coffee is extremely superior. The atmosphere is perfect to bring a laptop and get some work done as well."}
{"text":"Staying at the Hyatt downtown, walked over and was delivered some yummy coffee with a smile."}
{"text":"Small portion sizes for the price.  Inefficient, slow, especially for an airport location.  When I ordered two items, somehow the 2nd drink was never made and I'm standing there, on and on, watching other people who arrived after me receive their little lattes.  There was absolutely nothing special or deviant about my order.  After finally asking what's up, there was no acknowledgment that a mistake was made, nor an apology.  I don't care how local you are and how trendy you are, order accuracy, efficiency, and customer service still matter."}
{"text":"Top notch coffee and espresso here with polite staff, and my goodness I sincerely hope this is the new norm of having draft beers at a coffee shop.  Amazing.  High marks for the aforementioned reasons.  However I just don't care for much of the customer base here, especially the younger kids who seem to occupy the limited table space for lengthy periods of time.  Rather have the mid career to older demographic at many restaurants in this area.  Parking can be challenging at times as well, but that's not surprising for the area."}
{"text":"Tucked away just off University at Ash in an L-shaped area that is part commercial and part apartment complex.  The door and entry look like the entrance to a college classroom.  This is a seedy area with sketchy folks loitering and/or walking around, so don't take the nice car if you have one.

Inside it's a mix of hippie and yuppie atmosphere with high quality coffee equipment and young clientele with more tattoos and black clothing than you'll normally see in a week.  Espresso was one of the better ones in the Phoenix area, though I didn't care so much for the custom made drip coffee.  Espresso is the highlight of visiting here."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite coffee shops. Great atmosphere, delicious coffee and aesthetically pleasing decor. The only thing I would say is that I wish their hours were longer. I get off of work at 5 and would like a nice coffee but they're always closed when I can go. 

:/"}
{"text":"Service is stale and unwelcoming (tried this place twice). 

They didn't have half & half or creamer available, only milk. That was a surprise! The small, or tiny sized, cup was full of ice and barely any coffee. 

The only sweetener sitting out was Splenda, no stevia. After stepping away, I did overhear they have simple syrup (which was not sitting out).

A/C must be rationed by the owners because it was extremely warm inside. Not a pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Palmoar and found this hidden gem.  Coffee was so delicious and I really enjoyed my breakfast.  I came here each morning during my stay.

The staff is friendly and they offer military discount.  I love the general vibe, but was disappointed when I discovered it is a chain.  I must say I scout for \"traditional\" coffee spots, one of a kind type of establishments; however, the coffee is good, and the ambience is cool, so if you are in the area and looking for a good place to have a cup of coffee, don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"it was dead when i walked in... there was no line. i walked up to the coffee bar and looked at the menu behind the counter for about 30 seconds, not one \"hi how can i help you?\" or even slight acknowledgment of my existence from the Barista. i just turned around and walked out. no thanks."}
{"text":"Maybe the worst cap ever. First of all they only serve capp's for in house. Not to go. Then they only serve them in a proper coffee cup, 6 oz. I can drink that in one gulp. They agreed to put it in a big cup for me but I told them I did NOT want a Latte, which is what they wanted to sell me. If you can serve a latte in a to go cup, why not a cap? 
The cap was, in fact, like a latte and it was awful. The coffee tasted stale and there was no froth on the milk
Get your fix at the Starbucks before you head down to gate C"}
{"text":"I love having this cafe across the street from my apartment. Definitely becoming a regular here for the dirty iced chai."}
{"text":"Great Espresso and everything a coffee house should be. I only tried the espresso for a quick fuel up. It was perfect and kept me going all day ."}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee looks like an underground hipster coffee shop.  If you enter from the back side like I did, it looks like it is closed.  I like the coffee selection because it is very simple without too many choices to confuse you.  I got the freshly brewed cold coffee.  I am not a person who has a palate for coffee, but I can feel freshly induced flavors in the coffee.  The ambiance makes me feel like I am in the 1920s."}
{"text":"finally, a real coffee shop inside an airport.  The barista was very knowledgeable and will chop up coffee with you if you have the time.  Hipsters and coffee lovers will love stopping by here.  The best coffee I've had at an airport.  I highly recommend the pour over if you want a hot cup and cold brew for a cold drink.  Talk to the barista for recommendations on what kind of beans you want for your cup of coffee.

Goods:
+They roast their own coffee
+ Pour over coffee available
+ Cold brew coffee available

So So:
- More on the expensive side but it's an airport afterall.

I'd definitely make my way over here if I had a layover and some time for a fresh cup of pour over."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the experience had here. Iced almond milk latte tasted off and baristas seemed disinterested in customers."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place. In our short 3 day trip to Phoenix, we stopped by twice...and we didn't get much free time, so that's pretty big. 

The space is large and open, I'm surprised there aren't more students here studying. There is plenty of seating, and the coffee is delish. The chai is unbelievably delicious.

The food here seems to be just so so for me. I got the big ben, and it's like eating a giant omelet stacked inside of an english muffin. The sauce to egg ratio was definitely off, and when we asked for more sauce, we didn't get any, even though they promised to bring it out. 

The onion jam on the other BLT sandwich is AMAZING. I wanted to spread it over everything.

They got a knock down because their service is not the best, and the food was a bit underwhelming, especially compared to the drinks. The chai is thick and syrupy, almost a little too much, but it's great both hot and cold, but I prefer it iced."}
{"text":"Excellent espresso, nice ambience, friendly staff.

I am extremely picky when it comes to my coffee. When an espresso shot is not pulled properly, I can taste it. If I feel the need to mask the flavor my drink with sugar, it means that the drink was not made properly. What do I really know about coffee? Honestly, not a lot, but I just have naturally very selective taste. 

The baristas here are friendly and put care into their work. My barista very meticulously even made nice foam art in my latte even though I ultimately covered it with a cap. Cartel Coffee Lab also roasts their own beans, which does not mean it's automatically going to taste better because I've been to coffee houses that roast their own beans, but their espresso is mediocre to disgusting (Coffee Rush in Chandler anyone??)--whether it's the baristas, the machine, or bad quality beans. 

I didn't try their baked goods, but they looked reasonably fresh. Thank you, Cartel Coffee Lab, for making my wait at the airport infinitely more pleasant!"}
{"text":"Nice little place to get some coffee other than the typical Starbucks.  Great environment with very polite staff, grabbed a mocha here and it was pretty good.  Definitely will come back to try other things here."}
{"text":"Once again, Cartel deserves a five. My only complaint is that they don't open at five, so I could go there again in the morning, since I have an early flight out.

Best. Coffee. Ever. 

The very good news, however, is that they've opened a branch in the airport. I'll let you know if the service and coffee there is as good as it is on University Avenue."}
{"text":"This is the best place to come for a nice latte...if you want the ultra hipster patrons to stare you down while you listen to the baristas pretentiously make jokes about how lame Starbucks and its fans are. The coffee is definitely good, but it's not good enough for me to put up with some dude walking up to the counter, pretending to order a frappuccino and then laughing like an asshole with the cashier. Guess what I did right after I heard that? I left Cartel, drove over to Starbucks and had myself a frappuccino. And it was great."}
{"text":"Cartel is one of Arizona standards as far as specialty coffee goes! One of my favorite parts about cartel is the fact that every location has a different vibe.

This one is definitely the most chill of all of the cartels. This is where I come alone to do homework or I come with one other person to have great conversation. 

The staff is solid and all of the baristas know what they are talking about.

I come here pretty often because I know cartel is consistent across the board. 

BB's Rating: THANK YA JESUS FOR CAFFEINE"}
{"text":"Coffee that will seduce you into a false sense of security and then elope with your taste buds. From specialty brews to the standard drip, good coffee all around. If you're into great coffee I'd recommend forking a buck for a specialty brew."}
{"text":"Place is huge, from the outside you would have never guessed. Neat setting, atmosphere a bit dim. Zombie like service, all friendly. Coffee is like fireworks going off in my mouth. So good."}
{"text":"A great little hidden gem near the ASU campus. Most of the clientele were students and possibly professors from ASU... locals I am sure. Great vibe, good coffee and tea for sure. I will come back and visit if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"OMG, I love this little coffee shop!  I went there three times over the course of a couple of days while visiting Scottsdale. Unique coffees - I had a latte with agave in it. You don't get stuff like that at Starbucks!  wish we had one of these in Chicago burbs."}
{"text":"Came in for a cup of coffee and was greeted immediately by the baristas. Not knowing what I was in the mood for, other than caffeine, they made a recommendation and I ended up with a hot Chai Tea. They also offered a few tastings of their brews. I def will be back to try more coffee and touch down for a few hours. The place has a good vibe and lots of seating for reading or working."}
{"text":"Was in line at Paradise (Panera) next door where I know I love their coffee, but the line was shorter at Cartel and they had a less commercial, more modern look. Ordering and paying was a breeze using their iPad kiosks. Unfortunately, service dragged on a bit long. I waited 10 minutes for a small latte and watched the line next door dwindle in the mean time. The drink was pretty but nothing special. The barista did craft a pretty little steamed milk heart.

Overall I was unimpressed by the service. They weren't overtly rude, in fact, they were polite enough, but a coffee shouldn't take that long, especially with only a handful of patrons in line."}
{"text":"This place is beautifully decorated, super clean, and has friendly employees. 

My, how airport food service has changed.

Got a great iced coffee and spent some time here on a long layover.  Enjoyable, and if you're stuck in PHX airport, this is a great place to be!"}
{"text":"Cartel Coffee Lab is amazing. That should be capital A, Amazing!

I fell in love with this Phoenix coffee roaster and brewer years ago when visiting Tempe. But one of the things that made me fall in love with Cartel was its unflinching stance on the cappuccino. At their Tempe location, there was a sign that indicated no cappuccino could be ordered \"to go\".

And that stance makes total sense. 

A cappuccino is a small drink. And it's all about texture. And it's all about immediacy. It wilts. It fades. You shouldn't wait to drink a cappuccino. And if you've crafted a mighty fine version of this drink, you don't want it to sit around for a moment before it's enjoyed, lest all that textured milk deflate, the volatile aromatics dissipate, and the sum of your efforts fall apart as time takes its inevitable toll.

Of course, it makes total sense that at an airport especially, people might be in a hurry and want to take their drinks in a paper cup to drink on the way to their gate. 

I can't blame Cartel for not holding the line. 
But I can ding them a star. 

With love. Nothing but love.

For I feel it's an indictment against humanity that this Amazing coffee shop wasn't half as busy as Starbucks when we were passing through the Phoenix airport. It was nothing short of a gift from heaven that Cartel opened up an outpost in the airport, and I'm eternally grateful that I had another chance to have a drink from this great establishment.

Now I need to be on the lookout for flights with layovers in Phoenix. Because if I'm there again, I may just drop off a new sign demanding that no cappuccino will be made \"to go\"."}
{"text":"This place is strange in all the right ways.

It's strange how it's located on the ground floor of what looks like a Motel 6.
It's strange that you can get an incredible and beautiful cappuccino in the middle of the desert.
It's strange that they don't make flavored coffee and don't have an ounce of caramel on hand.
It's strange they source all of their own green beans, roast them in house, and never in the French style.
It's strange how the seem to actually have a lab a few doors down in the \"motel\".
It's strange that even though I've only been once, I love this place and everything about it.

I am so happy that I made this one of my first stops during my visit to Tempe.  Now I can go every morning and try the rest of their offerings.

And that is strange.  Because in one visit they have won me over to the point where I am not even interested in trying the other coffee places in town.  If that doesn't deserve 5* I don't know what does."}
{"text":"What a great coffee shop! My husband and I are really picky when it comes to quality of coffee... and we were impressed by this one. 

Location is downtown Scottsdale with a ton of cute shops around, the the coffee shop itself is very spacious with 2 different indoor seating areas (one secluded for those who need quiet) and an outdoor seating area. 

I wasn't at all impressed by their lemon bread and won't be ordering that again. However their chocolate chip cookies were good. Also, their cappuccinos, cold brew, and iced latte was legit"}
{"text":"Dropped by tonight for an Americano....not good!  I had high expectations, but this was the worst Americano I've ever tried.  Don't waste your time on this place.  I would rather spend the time driving over to Lux for some quality espresso."}
{"text":"Cartel serves the best coffee in the valley. Period. Which makes it one of my two favorite coffee shops. Seriously, everything I have ever tried of theirs has been spot on perfection.

Specifically I obsess over their brewed coffee which is made by an advanced coffee brewer (Clover) with a roast that you pick to be brewed. Obviously this is the only method for producing a supremely great cup of coffee (ie: freshly ground beans [roasted recently on-site] placed immediately into an instant coffee maker that produces one cup at a time). I have never had coffee made for me in such a caring way anywhere else. Even in other (read: better) cities I have never visited a cafe that roasts, grinds and produces the coffee in front of me. It's top notch.

If you don't want a brewed coffee (you should try it, come on!) then there are some good alternatives. The Excelente Latte is a wonderfully ingenious creation that is expressively Phoenician (or I guess more appropriately Tempeian). It's more or less a latte with horchata added. Served only over ice, it's great in the summer time.

Their coffee beans are all organically grown, and I assume the owner must work very hard to source the beans personally because everyone that touches them is very knowledgeable about where they came from, when they were roasted etc. That alone is impressive.

Cartel as a cafe is fairly unique... Cartel's atmosphere is just okay.. I wouldn't want to spend more time here than I had to. I just can't spend that much time in a decaying strip mall which happens to be the hub of Tempe's hipster scene... it's not that I don't love hipsters, but hordes of them get old.. I tend to prefer a more diverse set of patrons.

The quality coffee that Cartel offers more than makes up for anything I could fault them for.

So, in summery, I recommend the brewed coffees. Once you've tried their brew then I suppose you could go for a different drink next time, which I promise will also be wonderful."}
{"text":"Coffee was great! Service and wait, not so much. Cool hipster spot but I wasn't impressed with the cashier's short, snide attitude or the lengthy wait. Wish the service had been better - because of it, I don't feel the need to return."}
{"text":"Friendly, fun, and chill.

This place is just great. As a recent transplant to Tempe I was afraid that it was all strip-Malls and beige. I couldn't bring myself to submit to drinking the slop the Seattle based place serves, then a friend told me about Cartel.

I have a particular coffee drink need that is usually only met in New Zealand or Australia (a flat white). Seth makes a flat white to rival anything at home. The beans are delicious, and being there when they are roasting is amazing!

My only disappointment is that I can't walk there easily!"}
{"text":"Coffee was really good.  The place is very hipster it's a good atmosphere but if you trying to make friends there it might not be the best place because guess what ?? This is a place full of people using their phones or laptops.  I mean they have a free wifi so they have to take advantage of that for the expensive coffee right ? 

The coffee is worth the price thought.  Oh and let's not forget about the herbal tea.  It was really hot that I burned my tongue but it was so delicious ... 

Oh and you know what? They have beer !!! I haven't tried it yet but I'm sure is good.  Let me know if you try it please !"}
{"text":"Said I was going to try their coffee or expresso. Gave them a try this morning. Ordered two shots of expresso with an inch of foam. They made jokes about the amount of foam which I found very tasteless, arrogant and rude. The drink I order came and it was not what I had ordered. Again time to listen to a very rude person. Two shots of expresso and an inch of foam should be about two inches in the cup they use. There was less than in inch. I questioned them about it and received some mumbo jumbo about the foam being in the expresso. I believe what he was trying to say was I know more about expresso than you and I know how not you what you want. Really turned me off. I do not profess to be an expert on expresso. I have been drinking it for the past 30 years all way from Italy, Greece, and across America. I am not an expert but I do know what I want. And it is not someone rude arrogant person. The taste of their expresso was just slightly better than one of the well known chains. Customer service I would rate at a D-.  At a D- you don't get a return visit."}
{"text":"Cool place! We stopped in to check out a very talented friend's artwork on the walls at Cartel for the month. The coffee drinks are great as are the beers."}
{"text":"Cartel is such a quaint little shop with such a great vibe from the very talented baristas. I've just moved in with a new place down the street & I've been in cartel a handful of times now & they already recognize me & know my order. How sweet! The coffee is delicious. I get a latte & its just so smooth and inviting! & for later in the day they feature beer on tap!? How cool!! Love love love! Keep up the great work guys!


Also, i dont know if they make them homemade, but the blueberry muffins they sell are to DIE for!"}
{"text":"Been here off and on but never for this long. I've been working here today for 5 hours so far because I was nearby when they opened. I had a drip coffee and loved it. So tasty and made cup by cup. Then a black mango tea that was the perfect aroma and need nothing. Later in the morning a friend came in and purchased a cappuccino. OMG it was the prettiest thing I've seen so I had to buy one. I have NEVER had a better one in my life. I am serious. Come here. Drink here. I love their iPad cash register & art. Late Sunday mornings the wifi gets a little clogged from the number of people but it's a cool joint. 

PS. I know Jeff M. had issues with their customer service but the two ladies working today rock."}
{"text":"Horrible cup of coffee. Has a very bitter after taste. Very expensive as well. Wish I would have walked to Mc Donalds or the Panera Bread. Service was good."}
{"text":"3 Things!

1. Thank you Megan McCaughan for the recommendation.  You rule planets. 
2. Why couldn't this place have been there when I lived on Ash Avenue?  
3. I walked in wearing dress clothes.  I think the college kids shuddered at the thought that I could be one of their dad's friends on a business meeting.  Ew. 


What a surprise this place was.  From the outside of this mediocre (at best) building you would never suspect the world of gritty indie rock art that awaits inside.  From the massive old-school coffee bean grinder to the concert marquee letters plastered on the walls to the menu boarded up on wood panels for all to view....it all just makes silly sense.  Good vision. 

They say lines mean two things: either the establishment's prices are too low or the product is really good.  They were right.  Good stuff I tell ya!  In AZ, having a line is impressive.  This place had one and was well worth the wait.  Sure, I just got a Chai tea (as usual; my only drink) but it was amazing.   If I had to complain, I would say the portion size was quite small.  Let's face it, I am a beast and need a \"future fat boy's cup.\"  

Cartel, you have joined my very short list of favorite coffee/tea places in this wonderful state of AZ.  (Lola's on 3rd Ave, Hill Spot Café, and Inside the Bungalow rounding out my other favorites.)"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Cartel and what they have done in other locations, but the Old Town location just doesn't do the same for me.  It's so cold and stoic...no personality...and just blah.  

Old Town surprisingly doesn't have a lot of \"cool\" coffee shops like Downtown or even Tempe, so this will have to do when in the area....but it could be so much better."}
{"text":"Very hipster location. Major college vibe (of course, ASU is right there.....so duh) But, very comfortable....there's always plenty of seating, even tho it's always busy. Some cool artwork too, I like the bike wheel partition wall and the hair drying chair....quirky.

As for the coffee....VERY GOOD..... it has excellent flavor with a smooth....texture?? I guess, does that make sense??? Anyways, it's not as strong as Starbucks, but their iced coffee is WAY better......and they let you add your own milk. I like that. But then again, maybe i'm a little controlling of a person.......

I wish they had more pastries, especially vegan ones. And, it's hard to find this place. You kind of just have to know where it is......(just look behind buffalo exchange) It looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, but quite surpirsing once you enter :)"}
{"text":"Smooth, Rich, Perfect.....THAT is Cartel Coffee......why get coffee that's manufactured for the masses with mythological mermaids when you could be supporting your local Cartel? wait...that sounds a little weird, but, I think you get it....

Yeah, the coffee is good (maybe I would like it a touch stronger...), I didn't get any pastries (well, there were none I could try, hence the docking of one star, i.e. vegan or dairy-free), so I can't really comment on those.....But, I will definitly be stopping in here more often, especially as my hairstylist is right around the corner (go see Emily at Revolover, she's the BEST) We actually were strolling around Old Town when the intoxicating aroma of coffee just sucked us in......mmmmmm.....it was a perfect late afternoon pick-me-up!

It's really cool inside...there are a lot of lounge style couches everywhere (in fact, my mother-in-law felt so at ease, she plopped herself on one of them and took a 10 minute power nap while we sipped our coffee, lol) Would love to come back and get a drink at the bar (best of both beverage worlds here! chose your poison, alcohol or caffeine) and would also like to give their brunch special a go......stay tuned, perhaps I'll be giving that extra star soon!"}
{"text":"I avoid Old Town like the plague, but when someone suggested a meeting location here at Cartel, I had no choice.  2 minutes after arriving, I was waiting for the other half of my party, and all I could do was snap photos of the interior of Cartel - the decor is amazing.  The coffee was good too."}
{"text":"I have generally loved Cartel since I've been in Phoenix, but was saddened this time after not going for over a year. I took some guests there, thinking I'd treat them to my favorite coffee place in the Phoenix area. The coffees were lukewarm and didn't have much flavor, and in smaller cups than I remember (paper cups, even if you're staying in- except the cappuccino of course, also lukewarm).

I remember HOT coffee and coffee so strong and delicious that it gave me a buzz.

What happened??"}
{"text":"Nice little artsy coffee place with friendly staff that take the time to make really delicious coffee (and i'm not even a big coffee drinker)"}
