{"text":"This little hidden gem was a wonderful find! The staff was friendly, the food was fresh and quick, and the prices were just right!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stop in here often. Warm atmosphere and the food is top notch. Every meal we've been served has been presented as though we were in a 5 Star hotel and the attention to detail is evident. The menu is varied and filled with delicious entrees, sandwiches, soups and breakfast selections. I have posted pics of most of my favorites. The French fries are reminiscent of Kennywood fries. Always a friendly wait staff and very clean.  Do yourself a favor and give this place a try. You and your taste buds will be delighted for sure."}
{"text":"Late lunch with a friend today. We got there at 1 and unfortunately saw they close at 2 on Mondays...however, everyone was super nice to us and each of the staff (including from the kitchen) came over and spoke with us about our meals. I ordered their French Onion Soup which had a great beefy flavor and was loaded with onions, toasted bread and gruyere cheese. Not salty and a slight sherry sweetness to it. Also tried their Sea Salt Roasted Beets, Spiced Pecans, Spinach and Goat Cheese side salad...I could eat that every day! Beautiful golden and red beets, crunchy pecans, tangy goat cheese, and spinach sliced into ribbons that made it so easy to eat! My friend sampled the California Chicken Panini on toasted Sourdough Bread, with French Brie, Marinated Tomato, Avocado, Baby Spinach and Grilled Chicken. Is your mouth watering yet? She really liked that sandwich. We will be back to explore the rest of their menu. The place is pretty tiny and very casual. Not much memorable about the decor, but the food is terrific. They offer catering too which I have heard a lot of good things about. They open at 8 everyday (except Sunday) and serve breakfast, which is hard to find in the South Hills. Their hours are Monday 8 to 2; Tuesday and Wednesday 8 to 6 Thursday, Friday, Saturday 8 to 8. Definitely stop in for breakfast, lunch and/or dinner!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and I had the French Onion Soup which was delicious, maybe even the best I've ever had! My mom had the Gourmet Grilled Cheese with tomato soup and my sister had the Turkey Wrap with Beef Vegetable soup and they were both very pleased. We already plan on going back! They also have a lengthy catering menu worth looking at.

The staff is also very friendly which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"My wife heard about Au \"Grottens\" where she gets her nails done, so we decided to try it last week. Wow! What a great place! It's has a quaint and personable atmosphere. My wife ordered the Pot Roast and I ordered the \"Fresh Ground Burger\". The burger...was everything I expected. A HUGE burger, almost too big to bite, that was thick, juicy and tasty, with fresh cut fries. Definitely not a frozen patty. The roast was savory and delicious. The chef came out of the kitchen to check on the meals, and when he stopped by our table, we talked a bit. They offer a breakfast item using the same roast, compiled with potatoes, eggs and gravy...dinner for breakfast. I can't wait to try THAT. So, if you are looking for good, fresh food, with a homemade touch, you won't go wrong at Au \"Grottens\"."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Had it several times and enjoyed them all. Also catered my son's first birthday party and the food was delicious. This is our new go-to if we don't feel like coming and not sure what we want to eat."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast having no clue what I was going to find. There were many \"normal\", tasty sounding breakfast entrees like omelets & Belgian waffles. But I like different, & interesting so I ordered the Pot Roast Hash with shredded pot roast, potatoes, eggs, & toast. It was the tastiest, most interesting, different breakfast I've had since I can't remember when. Plus it was big enough to take for a tasty lunch later today. 
The atmosphere was also very warm & inviting with an interesting owner/chef (Steve). The building is a little hard to find tho being behind another building, so set your gps/phone & look for their sign."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Steve and his wife are very nice. A quiet family setting makes for an enjoyable meal, stop by and experience it for yourself..."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Really glad this spot came into the area. Brisket sandwich was delicious."}
{"text":"Places like these are my favorite--so intimate and so quality.  Wonderful attention from the waitress who's been with them from the very beginning and owner/chef coming to our table to ensure food was top.

Will take my father back here every time I'm in Pittsburgh visiting him.

Gem."}
{"text":"I stopped in today for my first time, and had an excellent breakfast of Pot Roast Hash.  It was delectable . . . good down to the last drop of gravy.  Service was good, and the chef was friendly.  I would like to come back again to try lunch or an early dinner (they close at 6:00pm).  There are some gluten-free options available too, so I can bring my wheat-sensitive spouse."}
{"text":"A must try. Have driven past this place at least twice a week for months but never stopped. After looking for breakfast joints on Yelp today, we decided to stop after seeing the reviews and pictures. Breakfast and service were great, highly recommend for anyone in the area. 

We will be hitting Au Grottens a lot more in the future."}
{"text":"My sister, mom & I came here for breakfast.  It was our first time here & we loved it!  It's a very cute, small place.  Everyone is so nice & the staff takes the time to talk to you to make sure you are having a great dining experience.   We all had the make your own omelet.  It was plenty along with potatoes & toast!  The omelet was filled to the max, which was great!  We will definitely be back to try lunch as the lunch specials sounded really good!  We all highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff and chef.  Stopped by with a friend to AuG because we had heard the food was good.  You enter an old restaurant that use to be Chinese, I think, with dated walls and tables.  The sign says to order at the counter and the food will be delivered to your table but the waitress said to sit anywhere and she would serve us.  The chalk board has specials and a BYOB sign.  After reviewing the menu, ordered the house smoked BBQ Beef Brisket that has a tangy BBQ sauce, homemade onion straws on a hard roll and a pickle.  The brisket was delicious with some smoky BBQ flavor and a nice tangy sauce.  The onion straws were perfect for the sandwich.  
The Chef did come out and introduce himself and talk with us.  All in all a good meal and friendly service.  
Hours are 7am to 6pm so more of a breakfast and lunch restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast one morning. It is very easy to miss the turn for the restaurant as it is kind of hidden. They were not that busy and there was plenty of seating. It is very casual as could be seen by the paper towel as napkins. I had the veggie omelet. They really did not give a lot of home fries. The omelet was good but lacking flavor and seasoning. It could have used some salt. My friends french toast did look very good. The prices are reasonable."}
