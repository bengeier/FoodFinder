{"text":"We stayed right down the street at Ruby Foo's and pretty much had breakfast here for most of our stay. Menu is varied with lots to choose from, food (at least breakfast wise) was delicious and generously sized. Service was consistently great and we were always seated promptly with our party of 6."}
{"text":"We went there for a dinner, we stopped at the Tiffany's because the traffic was too heavy  ;)  And we were surprised by the choice of food. It was really good and the staff was friendly. We highly recommend this address."}
{"text":"This is an older place and a bit worn around the edges but the food is good, portions are generous, staff attentive and accommodating and the price is fair.  I tried them for dinner and will return to try breakfast tomorrow.
.
Breakfast was great.  Specials include a glass of fresh squeezed OJ and coffee or tea.  Huge portion.  Lots of fresh fruit."}
{"text":"Went there today and was really disappointed. My wife ordered a omelet which was nothing special and I ordered a burger which was dry as hell. The waitress was kind of clueless. She didn't know what the soup of the day was and didn't offer my wife the dessert that was included with her meal. Many better options out there!"}
{"text":"Tiffany's has been a go to place for business lunches when meeting with someone form the north west part of town. They are located at the north end of Decarie and have a parking lot so it is easy to get to. The food has been reliable and they serve breakfast all day long. 

I usually order the salad Nicoise which is more than meal size and comes with a generous portion of seared tuna. When I was most recently there I ordered the Nicoise and the waitress said 'the tuna salad, right?' to which I agreed. Well, it seems that they have updated their menu and instead of a salad Nicoise I ended up with an Asian inspired salad with sesame crusted tuna that was way over cooked. Hopefully the Nicoise will be returned to the menu soon and order restored to the universe, until then perhaps the egg white omelette."}
{"text":"Haven't been there for supper yet, but breakfast and lunch menu is great. Amazing staff and always clean."}
{"text":"Went out for a late lunch after between meetings at the nearby Ruby Foo's, the place was empty but it gave me a chance to try something else other than the much busier Marathons's or Baton Rouge.

This place does a bit of everything well but not amazing. I got a rib-eye steak that did not really test Restaurant Quality, the flavor was exactly what I would expect from a Supermarket. 
Nothing compared to a Marven's or Tripoli rib-eye. It came with boiled veggies, mushrooms and only a few potatoes. The rest of the group got ribs and pizza, nothing remarkable from their end.

I also got a bellini drink which was not frozen or even puréed, just served in a small champagne glass.

The service was ok, they let us stay as long as we need, but we noticed the place started to get busier with a much older crowd after 5PM , most likely locals from the nearby Town of Mount-Royal

I would go back to try their breakfast, they seem to be popular for this option around these parts, there's also a terrace out back facing the highway but still nice for the sunlight in the summer."}
{"text":"Breakfast at Tiffany's..well what can I say? It's a trendy place, very clean but always packed during the weekend especially on sunday. The food is not bad and it's not great. Kind of pricy for breakfast but you get a big portion. I normally get the early morning dream which consist of 2 eggs, one choice of meat and a choice of pancakes or waffles..or the hearty meat eaters when I'm really in the mood for meat. Their coconut and pineapple smoothie are to die for!! Try tiffany's out for breakfast but I wouldn't go for supper!"}
{"text":"Big portions, pricey. I tried both the breakfast and table d'hôte rib steak. Good seasoning. Egg benedict and steak tasted what they are supposed to taste with nothing out of the ordinary. However I feel like the quality of the ingredients was lacking a little. The berries served on the breakfast plate were bad and the rib steak was incredibly fatty. The freshly squeezed orange juice is very good. The dessert that came with my table d'hôte, a chocolate mousse cake tasted like it came directly of the grocery store bakery section.

Very nice ambiance and service to match the price point but personally I prefer better quality food and less service."}
{"text":"Have tried this location a handful of times but will base my review on my last visit, which was yesterday. 

The restaurant itself is clean, well maintained and spacious. The private parking lot is always a plus. 

Now for the food. I ordered off of their breakfast menu and got the standard eggs with toast, potatoes, and coffee as well as a side of chocolate chip pancakes. The food was in one word fine, everything was edible, nothing was bad, but at the end of the day it was forgettable, nothing to write home about or get me to want to come back. 

The service was lacking, the waiter had to be flagged down for a coffee refill (a big no no for me), especially since the restaurant wasn't even half full and we saw the other waiters come and go several times with the coffee pot while we waited for ours. Maybe it was just an off day for our waiter but the experience as a whole has made it my last visit to this restaurant, there are a lot of other better options in the area."}
{"text":"So delicious I wept!!!
All three of us got different variations on the French toast breakfast, and all three variants were divine.  They make the most delicious scrambled eggs here that are exquisitely light and fluffy. 
Coffee, potatoes, bagels, everything was so good I couldn't stop myself. I don't know from English cream, so I figured I'd be getting whipped cream. But no, instead I got a tiny carafe of heaven. Sweet creamy bliss. And everything was elevated by the lovely diner decor and the fantastic staff who helped me pull off my plot to grab the heck from my dear friend who is notorious for grabbing the bill at lightning speed. I couldn't imagine a more lovely breakfast and I'm sure to return!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Went on the recommendation of other lovely Yelpers. It's not usually my part of town, so had no idea where to go with my dining mate, who leans toward less ethnic-based food. The menu here is huge, pastas, burgers, steaks, other main dishes, etc. I can't vouch for the more involved dishes, since I only ordered a sandwich. However, the grilled chicken was flavorful and grilled well. The aioli and the tomato confit was also tasty. Had several side dish choices. I chose shoestring fries and the lentil salad. Both were very tasty. My latte bowl at the end was so-so. All in all, a pretty solid bet if one is in the area and needs a place with a wide variety of food. Service was also very good and quick. I won't hesitate to come back for a quick, basic meal."}
{"text":"I'm at this very popular breakfast place on Decarie Boulevard in July. The city has closed the boulevard making it impossible to drive by. The Terrace has been abandoned because of the noise and dust from the digging of the sewer system directly next to the terrace.   I am one of only two tables of customers.
My server was lovely. We chatted briefly about the construction and the lack of customers. He smiled and said he's just hoping for the tide to turn. Construction will last for several more weeks so the servers here don't have very much to do.
I ordered the classic benedict and it was in front of me in less than four minutes.  It was very tasty, nice fresh fruit and a small order fried potatoes came with it. My bill came to about $17.50 which a bit high for breakfast in an average place but  you're in an attractive  restaurant where everything has been carefully thought out. The music is perfect, the staff is terrific, my breakfast was lovely. I hope you are able to pick your way through the construction and come for breakfast while it is quiet and support the staff as well as have a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. Good service. Go in for an Happy Beer :-)
Oh yeah, did I mentioned they have the best carrot cake"}
{"text":"I am getting the impression that the good reviews placed here were made by management, because never have I witnessed such terrible service. Even when speaking to the manager, we were treated with total indifference and callousness. Our table of 4 walked out. 
I guess most people know this as the restaurant was virtually empty on a Saturday night. 
The food is mediocre at best, but the service is just atrocious. The manager should consider a career where he doesn't have to deal with people. 
There are many restaurants that serve this fare, anyone of them would be a better bet."}
{"text":"Just excellent.  Mike was attentive to everyone's needs.  Made fore a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"We come to Montreal 2-3 times a year and we always end up here for breakfast: the portions are very generous, the staff friendly, the food tasty. I've never eaten dinner here but I can tell you the place is always bustling, day or night."}
{"text":"In from Pittsburgh, for 10 days this was my second visit first for dinner now for breakfast  both excellent meals!  Great smoked salmon Eggs Benedict.  The manager is excellent (Costa) Sp? What a great find!"}
{"text":"Great overall experience!! Had a nice supper. Well priced and service was good. Burger was good and they have breakfast which is nice too. Great decor and ambiance people are friendly."}
{"text":"I had breakfast with some friends from the other side of town and it looks like this resto is the well-known \"halfway\" point for a lot of folks as a compromising location to go to. Kindly note my review is for their breakfast so their lunch/dinner can be a complete different experience.

Firstly, having breakfast at \"Breakfast at Tiffany's? ...  Amusing. :)

We were there nice and early on a Saturday morning (8 AM!) and found ourselves amongst the less than a dozen patrons during our stay and when we left around 10 AM, the place had nearly 2 dozen patrons... so it's pretty quiet. Which is unusual for a Saturday morning.... at least for me. So if you like hearing those at your table talk normally, this is the place to go.

They have a significant menu with lots of options. I went with their Decarie Special which consisted of a pair of eggs with corned beef hash, potato latkas and sour cream. Served with choice of breads and fresh fruit garnish. I went with the rye bread since I've never had that for breakfast before. The food came in 20 minutes. Everything was decent but nothing stood out for me. I was disappointed at the hash and the rye bread but they were good enough to be eaten without complaint. 

The service was polite and friendly and on top of it all, very quick. Refills weren't a problem. Obviously, with so many little clients, I'd expect as much.

The price-tag is a little high for what its worth but nothing to complain about. All in all, decent enough... if I'll come back, I'll definitely try something else on the menu. Once again, a lot of options are available.

One last note, they should clean up their private parking lot, it's pretty dirty and I wasn't overly impressed to see a time-worn used condom on the floor near the closer parking spots to the resto."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for breakfast and brunches on the weekend. They have a big variety of items, the portions are good to start the day. I like the eggs benedictine and they do them well. They also have pancakes, fruit plates, lox bagel and more. Tiffanny is also popular for lunch,  you also have a big assortment of meals from salads to burgers. I came many times and was never unhappy. The service is fast and courteous. And you always leave full !"}
{"text":"I've been to Tiffany's many times before. It is local, convenient, and they have a large menu with pretty good food. 

I was there this morning and we were a group of 8 who haven't seen each other in quite some time. After just a bit over an hour, we were asked to stop our conversations and leave the table as they needed it for other guests. Never before have I ever been asked to get up and leave even if we already finished eating. 

So - if you want a very quick meal, this is the place to go, if you are looking to enjoy yourself, then I would choose somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's my first time at Tiffany s, my friends had special Decarie & I had the crepe aux fruits with English cream. Both dishes were average. I was disappointed with the crepe which was pretty chewy & lacked freshness. However the English cream was very good."}
{"text":"I had Breakfast at Tiffany's before heading the airport. This is not a place for gourmet but they had exactly what I wanted and the portion were huge. I wanted potatoes, pancakes and eggs and I got everything I wanted with the \"Tiffanys Brunch\". It is not located in a area where I would hang out but it is nice to share a meal with the fam.."}
{"text":"Where else can you go to have brunch with 6 friends, a baby and 3 children and be seated immediately and served quickly? I ordered corned beef hash, poached eggs and hash browns (which look like little chicken mcnuggets). Service was excellent coffee was strong and good and I enjoyed all my food."}
{"text":"So I went here with a few of my friends and it was great. We went here for breakfast to get a kick out of the \"breakfast at tiffanys\" phrase and it was good. the morning menu was good and I had chocolate chip pancakes last with fresh fruit topping, they also serve bread and the mimosa we had was delicious. Our server was a tad bit dazed and confused our orders with even other tables a number of times. So that was the only uncomfortable point I had throughout my experience here. Overall a decent place to go to with friends :)"}
{"text":"One block. I've been working one block away from this place for over a year and I'm just finding out about it now?! Well, fortunately, I catch up quickly. 

Tiffany's is a gem of a restaurant, right at the eastern side of Decarie and Ferrier. With a cool vintage vibe and exceptional service, it's where I'd imagine Don Draper would come for lunch if he worked in TMR. Big booths and full bar, it's a great temporary escape from the daily grind. 

Atmosphere aside, the food is also a treat. To eat, we asked for the ribs which they were unfortunately out of (warning: ask first or you might be sad like we were), but the Cajun Salmon Sandwich that I ordered was a pretty stellar substitute. Oh, and did I mention their sides? Fries and coleslaw of course if that's what you're into, but I'd highly recommend opting for the Lentil and Walnut Salad and Black Beans with Chorizo. So damn tasty!

Any who, if you're looking for a great place for a business lunch, or just somewhere to lay low for an hour or so, I'd highly recommend checking out Tiffany's."}
{"text":"My cousin took me here. I loved it! The name reminds me of Breakfast at Tiffany's and was so good. The food is plentiful and great to start the morning off right."}
{"text":"This review is based only on dinner, and based on that, it's OK. My food was decent, nothing to write home about. Service started off fine but went downhill toward the end, when I had to sit and wait and wait and wait for my check. The place wasn't very busy for dinner on a week night.

The inside is pretty nice, and the New York City theme (no idea why, it seemed random) made me feel at home.

Price wise, it seems to suffer from the same affliction as other sit down restaurants in the area: it's a little high."}
{"text":"As far as hearty, honest brunch food goes, Tiffany's hit the spot for me. I went with a friend who's been a regular in the last few years and I was impressed. First, the place was nice bordering on fancy, except for the fact that it's right by the highway. The decor definitely explains the restaurant name. We arrived around noon and didn't have to line up for a table though it was starting to be packed. The brunch options are well rounded and straightforward. Don't expect to see anything hipster sounding here. None of their smoothies got kale in them. I picked the Monte Cristo breakfast platter which consisted of challah French toast, bacon, scrambled eggs, potatoes mash and fruits. It was darn good. I had major envy with my friend's platter though, which came with latkas nuggets that tasted amazing! Yes, lucky for me, he gave me  a taste. Service was fast and friendly, and very importantly, the washrooms clean and really nice. I'm really tired with these new brunch places that try to be more creative than they need to be, so I'm so glad to have found this place!"}
{"text":"The food is terrible and over priced. The service is also very slow. I don't plan on going back there."}
{"text":"Tiffany's is always hit or miss - I've been here for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. I have friends who refuse to come and friends who love joining me, which gets pretty frustrating and typically prevents me from suggesting it as a place to go.

I love their breakfast, mainly because I'm a huge breakfast person and have no ability to determine what my taste buds are craving, thus resorting to their massive ensemble of pancakes, eggs, meat, toast and other deliciousness. It can be pretty expensive and the service is typically pretty slow. I usually get some modifications and substitutions, which they invariably mess up, causing frustration and aggravation... is it really that hard to get an order right? 

The worst part is definitely the wait which can be a bizarre form of torture. 

This is definitely a place where you're bound to hear gossip or run into everyone you know from the Westmount-Cote St. Luc-Hampstead area. 

For lunch, I'm a big fan of their burger and fries - very good and nice-size portions for the price. I've also had a couple of their salads which are generally very tasty - when they're completely fresh, which is not always. 

They have a liquor license but I can't recall ever trying their drinks... I've also never tried their desserts - their portions simply do not allow it!"}
{"text":"Super expérience! Service aux petits oignons. Les recommandations du serveur ont guidés ce que nous avons commandé et nous ne sommes pas déçus. Le pain doré est exquis, fait à partir de pain challah, moelleux, léger et gouteux. Les gaufres étaient parfaites tout simplement, légère, croquantes et moelleuses, portion généreuse, belles et délicieuses. Le seul point faible du repas est le sirop servi avec le petit déjeuner, du sirop de table. Sinon, le repas est dans mon top 5 de resto pour bruncher, j'y retourne assurément!"}
