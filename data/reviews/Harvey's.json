{"text":"Harvey's makes my hamburgers a beautiful thing. Or in this case, my veggies burgers. I'm not veg but I would gladly convert if it meant that I could eat Harvey's veggie burgers endlessly.   Their poutine is also fantastic and other than being slightly slower service than normal fast foods outlets Harvey's is top notch."}
{"text":"It's Harvey's, like any other Harvey's.... Except it randomly closes early sometimes.  No idea why."}
{"text":"I had good experiences and bad experiences here. The wings are great, fun time always a big crowd here. My last time there I ordered Mac n Cheese, it was good BUT had pieces of plastic all through it (like if you microwave frozen stouffers, that plastic on top) and I ordered a fish sandwich which was really dry and overcooked. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Ah, I have to admit, when I am in Toronto or Montreal this is one of my guilty pleasures.  The quality of the food is actually top-notch for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Disappointed with our meal today. Worker was in such a hurry he was so sloppy and skimpy putting on the toppings. The burgers seem smaller. Is this new Ownership here ? It used to be pretty solid.  My son had a Oreo milkshake and he said it tasted like vanilla. The restaurant itself was quite dirty. Food on the ground and tables not cleaned off.  Looks like we spend the extra $15 and go to Jacks and Fatburger. What I really miss is LICK'S."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 #5 burgers with toppings one with onions and one  without  and got 2 #5 burgers with nothing.  The lady lied to her boss saying i ordered plain burgers.   You need better employees. Ones that do the job right.  Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Second week in a row with the kids for lunch Saturday. Just before we hit Art music up the street. Had a hot dog today, not the lavish production it might have been but I liked it."}
{"text":"Have frequented this business often; from 2000-2010 while living in nearby Renfrew, and more recently since gaining employment nearby in Whitehorn. Circa 2005 I was struck by the attentiveness of the staff, so much so that I wrote to the manager to compliment them. Those employees are all gone now and it appears management has probably changed. The store has also undergone renovations. However the location does appear to operate as smoothly. The store appears clean and the menu still offers what appears to be fresh-cooked food. You can watch as it is prepared and as is normal for Harvey's, you have the option of which condiments and toppings. The variety is not as diverse as other placesand choices are likely not as \"healthy\" but the flame-cooked items appeal - the hot dogs are probably the best of any 'fast food' places, bar none. For what is is - a no-frills, made to order hamburger stand - Harvey's offers good value, and this location in particular has always been a joy to frequent, with efficient staff and a clean environment."}
{"text":"I have been to this Harvey's a dozen times and usually the experience is good. However, this past time was terrible!!  The drive through line was shorter than the inside line so we chose that. The line moved incredibly slow, we were asked to park and our order would be brought out. After 20 minutes waiting I went inside. I saw similar orders to ours processed and handed out. All in all, we waited 50 minutes, received poor service, no apology and the wrong order.  I'll drive up the road next time to the queen location"}
{"text":"I can't understand how this location is still open. We have ordered several times, and each time we received old dried fries. Yesterday we even got old hard bread, we called to complain and they think that by offering perogies free of charge they can just shut you up. The location itself is dirty.  Ps: when you think you order Swizz chalet fries, watch it!, you might get old Harvey's fries. Just Disappointing,"}
{"text":"best fast food grill bugers than any other fast food chains. look for online coupon before you order. no nned to print. usually you can just show them the e-coupon on your phone"}
{"text":"It's a downtown Harvey's so if you are hoping for a quiet meal ... Well it's just not happening. You will be bombarded by the homeless / under privileged asking for spare change but they don't  pester! Don't be alarmed or offended, they are just asking for change not your left kidney!!! Staff is very helpful and the burgers never disappoint."}
{"text":"This location has cockroaches. My first and last time visiting this location. I should have taken a picture but I was frozen with disgust when I saw it crawling around."}
{"text":"Harvey's is my go-to burger spot. Their char flame grilled angus is incomparable to any other burger I've had. They also take incredible care to ensure you have it your way, well when you're dealing with someone somewhat experienced. I've been coming to this particular location forever and I wouldn't change it, I've tried others and just not as impressed."}
{"text":"Better than most harveys, way better than any McDonalds and a tad better than Burger king."}
{"text":"I love Harvey's; it's an original Canadian Hamburger joint... Harvey has his haters, though. My girlfriend refuses to patronize the establishment because they put too many toppings on her burger that all blend together and drip in one contained fluid of pickle, lettuce and mayonaise juice that will stain the pants.... Although she doesn't get it; the burgers are good. The only problem I have with this particular location is the one day I caught a kitchen girl trying to dump already cooked (and presumably old) onion rings into my fresh order. She was hiding in the back and I saw her pull out a few suspicious looking rings from a plastic tub and add them to the rings that we're going down in the deep fryer. Why? I don't know. It was weird and I didn't eat them. I also let Harvey himself know, wherever he is. I didn't hear anything back though, so I assume he must be protecting this girl. So I try to go elsewhere to order a burger. But now that I think about it, it kind of pisses me off that they didn't even send me an email back apologizing for trying to recycle old onion rings on me.... I'm taking a star or two off for that now and I suggest they get this store in shape. But their burgers are good at any other location...."}
{"text":"I ordered a fish burger, saw the server took out from fryer without even draining the oil, put on bun right away, when I bite into it, it's so oily and fish was so soggy and falling apart, I returned it back to the server, he just rolled his eye on me and then manager said to me if I want another one, I said no, then she said the fish supposed to be oily as it was deep fry, she didn't even know why it was SO oily as the server didn't drain the fish before he put on bun"}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to review chain restaurants, but I'll make an exception for Harvey's. Through incessant coupon mail outs in 2015, Harvey's lured me in to the store by appealing to my parsimonious side. The main attraction here is the burger topping station, where you can ask for extra this, none of that, etc.. For the price of a regular burger at other fast food joints, you get a flame-broiled patty that you can top with one or more of 8 sauces like chipotle or caesar, your standard toppings like lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, plus fun stuff like corn & beans, cucumber, tzatziki, and banana peppers. I don't get cheese or bacon because there is no point with a giant mound of all this other tasty stuff drowning it out. I also like that you can sub onion rings for fries at extra cost in combos*, and an upgrade from a pop to a shake is only 99 cents. Harvey's is what I imagine Subway and Wendy's love child would be, and I like it.  *Pro tip: stick a few of your rings in the burger for extra deliciousness."}
{"text":"Had been awhile since we had Harvey's so we stopped into this location. Chicken was dry and upon further inspection was old looking. Cashier was impatient with my son while he took one extra second to decide and made faces at the customer behind me. To top it all off, a fight broke out! In the middle of the day! Between adults! Will not be returning to this location. For the same price you can go up the street to Magoo's (dundas and royal york) for a handmade burger and handcut fries."}
{"text":"Only recently realized that they have actually have a vegetarian menu! So amazing! It obviously is one of the main reasons why I liked this place. But the thing that keeps taking me back is their absolutely amazing milkshake that they offer. I'm not even a fan of chocolate flavour, but definitely not when it comes to those milkshakes they sell. The staff is a little bit on the slower side, but I don't have a different location to compare it to. All I would say is, make sure you add a few more mins to your usual expected time."}
{"text":"Visiting from Regina where we don't have a Harvey's anymore. Harvey's is one of my favourite burger joints and this one didn't disappoint. It's in the food court on level L3 of the 10 Dundas East mall, easily accessible from the subway station there."}
{"text":"The only reason my friends and I come here is for Cody. Cody always makes an effort to make us feel like we're his favourite customers. It doesn't feel like a fast food chain. He makes this Harvey's what it is!"}
{"text":"This is a great Harvey's. Quick service. Toppings were fresh. No hassles about coupons. Tasty burgers."}
{"text":"I love harveys I wish we had then in new york. Burger was decent but the experience was amazing, I still talk about this place a year after going."}
{"text":"Moi aussi! Came here as a little one until I was an adult & the sad day I left for the west.  Tasty burgers and staff were always friendly."}
{"text":"It is not too often I eat and review fast food. That said, we enjoy eating at this Harvey's. The staff at this location always seem friendly.  I love knowing my food is sourced from Canadian Farmer's, whether it is the vegetables, meat, or dairy.  I also love to choose toppings which you really don't do anywhere else.   As mentioned in a previous review, it is nice to have the veggie burger option.  For a quick and somewhat healthy bite, I'll stop in at Harvey's!"}
{"text":"I had never been to a Harvey's before, so my boyfriend and I decided to check it out  this afternoon upon discovering that I had a coupon (9.99 for two burgers, fries and drinks) which expired today! Good timing!  I was beyond impressed with my food and experience; this is definitely up there with the best fast food I have ever had. I really loved how the burgers were prepared. The patties themselves were cooked in the kitchen in lightning quick time, and then handed over to the server, who dressed the burger with salads and sauces according to my personal preferences. Really loved the combination of the preparation time of a traditional fast food restaurant, with  the emphasis on personal customer preference that is usually reserved for somewhere more upmarket.  Any fears that the food would be compromised as a result of the speedy service disappeared as soon as I took a bite into my burger. Piping hot, and just delicious - all my toppings stood out, and everything just tasted RIGHT. (Anyone who's familiar with fast food burgers will be familiar with that sinking feeling you get when you bite into a burger and realise something you can't quite put your finger on is just...wrong!)  Loved the fries too - thicker than the skinny McDs ones, but skinnier and less poofy than those gross overly-potatoey ones you get at Hero's. Washed down with some Pepsi, the whole meal was just yummy.  I couldn't believe we got two burgers, two sides and two 20oz drinks for 10 dollars +HST. You'd easily pay twice the price for FAR inferior burgers at a 'proper' restaurant chain or pub.  I will definitely be back, even without the money-saving coupon, this is worth a return visit. I just wish they had more locations!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Harvey's location in Mississauga. Friendly staff who always give me an HST discount (and I'm not even friendly or very regular). Good fresh food. Much better than other nearby locations. Big, clean place with plenty of places to sit. Definitely on the better end of fast food burgers."}
{"text":"Line long food smaller portion than MCD. Washroom is filthy. CSR took wrong orders and mgr argued but eventually except his mistake. Won't ever go to all Harvey's again"}
{"text":"Great Canadian on a regular bun. Lettuce, tomatoes and pickles.  Fries, gravy on the side with black pepper."}
{"text":"We have been visiting few burger places in search of the best veggie burger. After Hero and Acme, it was time to Harvey's. I was excited and it was worthy, as the burger end up to be really delicious. We enjoyed it with fries and ice tea. For a Friday winter night it was pretty quiet, as it was occupied mostly with singles and few couples. I know why they were all quiet, as the burger was too good to have a conversation. Ha!  The other time when we were there my excitement was cooled down when we got to putting the burger together. Older Chinese man was serving us and he was so fast and so unclear to me that when he asked something I took a moment to reply and he already replied himself and poured something on my burger which I didn't want. It was a turnoff and one of us took that up to the manager and we were served another burger. All was good at the end, but totally unnecessary in my opinion.  I am not sure if the veggie burger at Harvey's is the best, but we will find ourselves going back there as the food was really good, though the place itself and service not so much."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always clean, always fast, always good.  If you ask for pickles on the side, they'll give you lots and wrap them up nicely. All of the cashiers seem to be hard working and competent - which is kind of rare at fast food (and Seattle-based coffee shop) franchises in Liberty Village."}
{"text":"Good location.  Staff is friendly and courteous.  Food is good and toppings are fresh.  Always has parking available.    Sometime the place could use a bit better clean-up.  Seems to be on par with other Harvey's locations this way.  Main reason I wanted to write this review is to express my concern over the new touch-screen Pepsi fountain drink dispenser.  It is slow, confuses old people and often takes multiple hits to make it work proper or get what you want out of it.  Very unsanitary and you are forced to touch it with your bare hands!     When you think about it... people are touching this screen with their dirty hands that have been touching doors, going to the bathroom (let's face it... we see people that leave without washing their hands) and near their mouths (especially when they going for a re-fill).      People are all about touch screens and tablets... the old way worked fine.  The normal way is cleaner... you can touch it with the side of your cup (hands-free) and low maintenance."}
{"text":"This spot might have been good before but now it just surves reheated paddies on old toasted bread. Come AYOR"}
{"text":"I love Harvey's, but this one has serious communication issues.  The person who adds the burger toppings was definitely not comfortable speaking English and could not understand me. She also mixed up another customer's order while I was there.  I think I will stick to the Aurora Harvey's where this is never an issue."}
{"text":"it's okay. but $4.50 for a plain, skinny, dry hot dog was a bit much. the poutine is a bit too big of a portion for a side. burgers are good. wish they used a different, crunchier lettuce. it's shredded and very limp. would prefer wendy's or a&w."}
{"text":"It's a fast food restaurant so really my expecations weren't high. But this met them quite well! I ordered the fish sandwich combo for $5.99 (with coupon) which came out to be $6.77 with tax and it was all worth it! The fish was just a regular fish fillet like you find at other fast food places but the bun was big and they let me go all out with the toppings so it ended up huge by the end...a HUGE bonus compared to other places which just have tarter sauce and cheese if you're lucky.  The fillet was cooked fresh so it did take a few mins which was fine with me. The fries were thick, not too salty, and perfectly crispy and soft on the inside. I eat a lot but this meal filled me up.  The employees all looked a little lost and I think there are too many in the small space behind the counter but they were all nice and pleasant to deal with.  The sitting area was clean but I didn't eat there. The crowd had a mix of different people, including some homeless but i live in the city so it wasn't unnerving to me like it might be to others.  I will be trying their veggie burger next time but overall this is a great place for an affordable, filling meal."}
{"text":"This is a review for the malton location on Derry, couldn't find it on yelp. It's always fresh and consistent however drive thru can be slow at times."}
{"text":"If I didn't have to choose a star I would have picked none that is how bad this place is.  They are not professionals.  The manager talks and doesn't do her job and I have to wait for my food while she talks.  Watered down pop and she doesn't care talked to CEO of the company to no avail.  Left messages and the manager is rude.  I wouldn't go back.  The veggies are rotted and they have to dig at the bottom to get fresh veggies would I go to any Harvey's in Canada my answer to that is no."}
{"text":"Really disappointed by what I saw here. The staff that make your burgers up with toppings wear gloves but not the staff who cook them.   The person cooking the burgers coughed on the back of their hand and then grabbed a patty put it on a bun and then put it up ready to be served. I was disgusted.  All Harvey's are like this.  If this is going to go on close the kitchen off so we can't see it.  Next time you go into a Harvey's watch the cooks ( very easy to see your burgers being cooked) they never wear gloves.  And cough and sneeze on the back of their hand. ( guess that makes it ok.)  Harvey's you are disgusting."}
{"text":"This location also serves Swiss Chalet so I decided to combine two crowd pleasers: the classic poutine with Swiss Chalet sauce and it was so yummy!"}
{"text":"Oh No what happened .... Went there today .  The lady on cash seemed not to take my order  .  With a blink of a eye my food was ready BURGERS  and fries  .  I picked my topping and I was off got in the car and drove 900 m to home  Sat down to eat my meal and  was cold .  They just have everything cooked for hours a d put it together when you order . If  wasn't  so sick i would  go back and cause a seen . $ 23.00 that I don't have down the drain . Should of cooked my own . Thought They still did it the old way cook it fresh on the grill for you . Nope I got cold food . Even the bun was not toasted  fresh ."}
{"text":"Ma visite a commencé par les toilettes. 1 urinoir bouché voir défectueux, l'autre était dans le même état que la toilette: nettoyé il y a 2 jours d'après la feuille d'inspection sur le mur. Ça commençait mal.  Le personnel au comptoir fait son possible tandis que le \"cuisinier\" parle sans arrêt. Ménage de la salle à manger et caisse super. L'autre nettoie la vitre du comptoir de condiment SANS protection sur les aliments! On fait des erreurs sur la seule commande à l'auto qu'il y a à ce moment là. J'étais le seul client à l'intérieur et ça a pris 10 minutes avant de recevoir ma commande. Le \"cuisinier\" parlait encore pendant tout ce temps là et ses collègues n'était vraiment plus capable. Je jure que je n'invente rien. Finalement, la nourriture, burger de poulet croustillant inintéressant avec mayonnaise qui goûtait sure. Le seul point positif, les rondelles d'oignons qu'on ne trouve pas ailleurs."}
{"text":"Price not bad for what you get, customer service rather decent, food quality always quite good.  I've been to this location many times, and have yet to be disappointed. The price is the same as any Harvey's, so a tad pricier than your average fast food venue, but I feel you get what you pay for, as they quality of their burgers is of much higher quality than say McDonald's or Burger King next door.  The staff is always friendly, and for the most part rather efficient.  All-in-all, I'd definitely return to this location again."}
{"text":"You're eating at a Harvey's, so don't come expecting gourmet dining. Still, the staff is friendly, service quick, and they're open late. Definitely a decent place to eat if you're wanting a quick meal in the Village."}
{"text":"I've seen better for cheaper; the meat here is tasteless. I asked for hot sauce on my takeout burger and when I opened it up at home, there were literally 3 drops of hot sauce on the burger. That's just pathetic."}
{"text":"The last 3 times I went here, they had no honey mustard. They finally told me they don't carry honey mustard anymore. Just this location. Who the f*** intentionally stops carrying honey mustard?? You can't have fries or funion rings without HONEY MUSTARD *insert angry face* Never coming to this location again. Burger was great though and it's funny to watch the old man with white hair work."}
{"text":"I went there for their chocolate milkshake and it was so gross.  tons of sugar in it and no chocolate taste.  Harvey's has cheapened up their menu a lot.  I used to love their chocolate milk shake 3 years ago and now it's just garbage.  I bought one for myself and 1 for my husband. Both me and my husband took one sip and threw it out.  And the fact that my husband is not a picky eater and threw it out says a lot.  If he doesn't like it, it means it's really bad.    What a turn off.  Never again."}
{"text":"Come here all the time.  The staff that work here are extremely efficient and friendly.  Couple that with the harveys offers coupons that are circulating throughout the neighbourhood harveys is a great choice for a quick bite in liberty village.  Plus they do have free parking for 20mins in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the slushie with nerds! It was amazing. Fries are gluten free. Veggie burger is also great. Clean and lots of staff. Great place to sit and relax to eat."}
{"text":"Providing a veg burger for vegetarian is great, but how would you cook in in the same griller of the meat!!!  Please consider to make it fully vegetarian!   Also the fish how you frie it with the chicken, dont you think some ppl has allergy from fish!!"}
{"text":"The website has online coupons -  just flash on your phone.  Went on a Thursday at 6:30 PM. There was a  small crowd but no wait to take my order -- they did seem to have a problem with providing onion ring orders, as every order seemed to be cooked individually.  They ha run out of Hotdog buns,  and put my daughters hotdog on a hamburger bun (cut the dog in half and laid across the bun).  They did ask before doing this -- but as soon as she picked up the burger/dog the meat fell out -- oh well.  Harvey's cooks food to order, so it is always fresh -- but when they get busy the back up can be long  --  with a family of four in front of our family of three, we waited 12 minutes for 1 Burger, 1 Hotdog, 1 Chicken Sandwich, 2 Fries and 2 Onion Rings.  The toppings were  fresh and crisp. The dining room was clean, and -- hey its Harvery's a Canadian Institution."}
{"text":"My favourite cheaper burger chain. Love that you can pick your own toppings and sauces as your burger is being made.   Don't get much other than double Angus with cheese and its very good.  I think I prefer Harveys over more expensive places like Hero.  All locations tend to be on point. Good job Harveys."}
{"text":"I didn't really appreciate the waiting time for my burgers, it literally took them over 15 minutes to complete my orders, that's because they grill the beef patties on-demand instead of making a whole batch and use them. In retrospect I think it was a nice thing to do as freshly grilled patties tasted generally better, however that kind of defied the purpose of \"fast food\".  That being said, the burgers tasted wonderful with the different choices of condiments, and the fries were well seasoned with salt & pepper. However the fries were a little bit cold and I wish they can adjust their fountain machine such that it gives less syrup and more carbonated water (the Pepsi was \"diabetically\" too sweet).  It was my first experience in a Harvey's restaurant, and I was not too disappointed."}
{"text":"Harvey's certainly has good food. It's usually very delicious and service has been quick.  But my question is: When did Harvey's get so damn expensive?"}
{"text":"Food overall is decent and at par with other locations. However how can you screw up an order and then make a body language to say its such a cumbersome task to make it right.   A friend of mine ordered the Fresh Bowl and wanted only veggies. But as the food was being prepared the manager puts in chunks of veggie patties in the bowl. My friend noticed and pointed it out to the staff. The manager had the nerve to make a hand gestures in front of us like we weren't there. This is a perfect example of very bad customer. Fix it or we won't be back.   April 5, 2018 update: the parent company has responded back for follow up. Thank you for your care. It is much appreciated and shows you care about the customers. I love Harvey's (more than the other one with that yellow sign)."}
{"text":"Worst Harvey's I've been to yet! Harvey's has good products and is service focused but unfortunately at this location the garnish was messy, the associates were rude. When asked for a fresh patty I was given one from the warmer then lied to about it. Harvey's proud themselves to be a quick serve restaurant, but this one is no different than a typical quick and dirty fast food."}
{"text":"It's shared with the Swiss Chalet and I think that's great...depending on what you feel like. Because the Swiss Chalet side had no chicken and the average waiting time was 30 minutes, I opted to get the Harvey's Grilled Chicken Burger. Stingy with the tomatos and I don't even know what the proper amount to give is. My boyfriend got two, I got one.  Seating is ample and they have booths! If you don't feel like spending big bucks at Burger Priest, then this Harvey's is across the street (and is the better alternative to KFC!)"}
{"text":"Poutine is DELICIOUS. Absolutely delicious. There's a classic version as well as a bacon version.  I wouldn't recommend the milkshakes - get a soft drink instead. Refills are free & they have a diverse variety of selections :)   Overall a solid place for a quick, cheap meal."}
{"text":"Harveys is one of my favorite burger chains in toronto next to five guys but this location kind of ruined my experience. The bun on my cheeseburger was way too doughy, the bacon was overcooked and the fries were also very undercooked. The burger itself had been on the grill for way too long and was almost completely charred, and the soda never mixes right with the corn syrup in the fountain. It's obvious that they, like kfc want you to buy the bottled pop which costs twice as much with your order. Do yourself a favor and pick another location if you're craving for Harveys burgers"}
{"text":"I love this Harvey's! I have come to this location about 3 to 4 times since it has opened and it has been consistently good. Service is quick and friendly and food is cooked well. Restaurant and bathrooms have always been clean. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain , but I went there today ordered a crispy chicken sandwich when it came time to tell my toppings I saw a BBQ chicken. I told the server  tried to prusuade me into taking the bbq chicken I let her know I don't like BBQ sauce, that's when she developed a attitude when I got my order I asked for a little bit of siracha sauce , she poured out alot of siracha sauce. I like my food spicy but not that spicy When I went to my car go eat the burger the chicken patty was beyond dry and tasted like it was freezer burnt. I couldn't eat the burger it was inedible and the meat patty was not only dry but hard."}
{"text":"Sometimes a girl just wants a burger 'n fries. I know what you're thinking: \"EXCUSE ME! AREN\"T YOU A VEGETARIAN?!?!?\" And yes I am, so lucky for me, I live in the 21st Century where they will just as happily fry up a soy burger, as they will a quarter pounder :)  I had had a REALLY bad experience at a Harveys 10 years ago and hadn't been back since. But I know for a fact that they custom-make burgers, so I wanted to give them another shot.  This particular location couldn't be more convenient (located outside Brentwood Mall), and the staff was more than gracious. They listened to exactly what I wanted and served a MEAN (veggie)burger.  Oh my god, it was DELISH. Like to the point where it's been 6 days and it's still all I can think about.  I was lucky enough to time things right so when I went, it wasn't busy at all. I paid around ~$7 for a burger and fries and like I said, I was satisfied to the core."}
{"text":"My favourite fast food burger joint in the world! If Americans had Harvey's then In-N-Out and Shake Shack would no longer be the most beloved fast food burger joints. Unfortunately, Cara Foods believes that there's still ample growth opportunities in Canada so it's unlikely that we'll see any Harvey's south of the border any time soon. The patties at Harvey's are inexplicably satisfying, and the fries aren't bad! The only drawback is the long wait times stemming from the length customization process of their burgers whereby customers choose their own toppings."}
{"text":"Super slow to make food! I guess the skip the dishes orders are more important than the customers in the store."}
{"text":"Harvey's used to make a hamburger a beautiful thing, but not anymore!  They have changed the toppings!  For the first time since 1959, HARVEY's has changed the great time tested toppings!  They didn't add MORE toppings.  They replaced their regular toppings!!!  Harvey's no longer offer chopped onions for a hamburger!  They now ONLY offer thinly sliced RED onions!  Red onions???  Nobody puts stringy sliced RED onions on a burger!  Maybe in a fancy salad, but never on a burger!  Red onions are too strong and overpowering!  And they no longer offer fresh and crispy chopped lettuce!!!!  They only offer wimpy leaf lettuce!  Harvey's has lost a customer!"}
{"text":"Took 15 min to get one burger combo in a line that only consisted of me and the person ahead of me. Not happy."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good location, I've eaten there a few times and never been disappointed. Other than the speed bumps in the parking lot, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"I love a good Harvey's burger. I think it's better than all the new higher end burger places. This is a new location. Fast and polite service."}
{"text":"The best Harvey's in terms of food quality, service and cleanliness. The owner/manager is on the Ball here."}
{"text":"ThIs Harvey's will forever and always have a special Place in my heart because my mom and I would go when I was a little girl , my earliest memory is being 3 Getting a hot dog or a burger with onion rings and grape juice, till this day it's the only place I can get onion rings because everywhere else infer veggies it fries or salad or a baked potato! Call me sentimental but this place means so much to me , I have not been in it in two decades and some Change but I hope if and when I get a chance to go back that they still kept it clean and everything in it's place! Looking forward to the grape juice and hearing someone stating my order on the microphone hahaha"}
{"text":"Harvey's is comfort food! This location is great for those grabbing a bite in between shopping or getting off the 39 bus stop. Cleanliness is not the forte at this location but service is quick. There are always deals available through mailed coupons or using their online app. There is plenty of parking as well. A plus that they actually have separate bins for recycling divided by paper/plastics/trash. Free wifi- so you can stream a show while you enjoy your meal :)"}
{"text":"This hit the spot in terms of junk food. Burger was was pretty good. Onion rings were crispy. The hot dog was good, but the girl put too much ketchup, mustard and relish."}
{"text":"While I'm on a franchise-binge lately, I suppose I'll review my go-to Harvey's.  In terms of fast food, I think Harvey's serves one of the best burgers out there. I don't think I've ever been served one that wasn't totally plump and juicy, and they're definitely generous with the toppings. I'm also a pretty big fan of their onion rings. Deliciousness all around.  The staff is also very friendly, and there are plenty of tables to accomodate crowds."}
{"text":"It was hell it was such a mess old food all over the place pick up on the ceiling no one cared staff was rude tripped and fell asked to leave I threw my burger the manager and walked out"}
{"text":"This Harvey's is awesome!!!! That's all I won't to say! :D it's the best Harvey's I've been to! Service is great and everything's great!"}
{"text":"The pleasure of eating at Harvey's is unlike any other.  Their menu is really limited but completes any craving all at once.  The Angus really hits the spot for me. A couple of regular burgers are enough fuel for a day. Not the biggest fan of their fries,  but it can be changed for a salad. They changed their soft drink mixture or machines and went from terrible to amazing.  Their pickles are unique (ask for extra) and their pulled pork is heavenly.   They recently renovated so it's less grimy and more family friendly than before.  The place is right by the service road to get on the highway and the parking is very small. Those (and lack of a drive-thru) are minor gripes for a chain that seems to be closing stores left and right here."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Harvey's for well over 10 years and I am always impressed with their polite and responsible service. I never have any issues."}
{"text":"Great place for fast food. Burgers are cooked with flame grill and you choose your toppings, subway style. Fresh cut fries complete the meal. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru at the Harvey's in Airdrie on Saturday October 04. After placing my order, I pulled up to the drive-thru window to pay. A lady took my money & when she was giving me my change back, she gave me a $5 bill, & when she went to give me the rest of my change, she missed my hand with some of the coins. She leaned out the window & looked where she had dropped some of the coins in the snow. After doing that, she looked at me, closed the drive-thru window & walked away. She never offered to replace the coins that she dropped in the snow, when she missed my hand. When I was given my order, I asked the guy, who the lady was that just took my money to pay for my order. He said that she was the boss. The other people in my truck, couldn't believe the actions they witnessed by someone who is supposed to be the boss. I used to go to Harvey's quite a bit, but after the actions of the lady in charge, I don't think I'll be going back there."}
{"text":"The most reliable location. Never once had an issue, super friendly staff, well-run and clean. Harvey's has always been a step above the competition, and now they seem to be aware of the greater presence of deluxe burger joints. They've added a few items to the menu, and also have added 'premium' toppings such as roasted corn, tzaziki, various sauces - at no added cost. I hope their corporate office recognizes this place as this location is really the standard for quality control and customer service."}
{"text":"Slowest services ever. There clearly has been a change of management and definitely not for the better."}
{"text":"We came back here last weekend for some emergency burgers (I hadn't eaten in hours, which puts me and everyone around me squarely in the Danger Zone.) The service was really quick and polite. I was truly able to get my breaded chicken burger my way and it tasted pretty good. I think. I didn't so much eat it as swallow it whole.   I'm generally not a huge fan of Harvey's but the fact that we were able to go from super hungry to fed in the span of 8 minutes was a huge bonus.  Also, this is THE Harvey's of my childhood. Most of my memories of my grandpa involve walking here from my family's house nearby and getting burgers. Good times."}
{"text":"Went in and had a delicious poutine (one of the best fast food poutine around) and a burger. We got in at the perfect time as business started picking up right after we ordered. Food was quick and service was decent. An enjoyable experience all around."}
{"text":"Harvey's was the first hamburger joint I ever visited when I arrived in Canada from the UK and I was enthralled. Nowadays, I can safely say their burgers are a reliable option if you're in need of a quick refuelling.   This location is much like the rest of them: clean[ish], prompt and functional. Their fries are still in the top 10% of take-out versions. Being allowed to pick your toppings, right then and there, has always put them one notch above the other chains. I'm a \"mustard, onion, tomato and double pickle\" guy, personally."}
{"text":"Écrire sur une chaîne de restos de bouffe rapide meh...ça m'm'intéresse plus ou moins.... Par contre, quand le service est incroyablement extrêmement mauvais....il faut l'écrire....Sur Yelp  .   Alors, après une visite à la vente l'Oréal en famille, nous avions faim. Il était environs 3h30 4h00 On voulait manger quelque chose de rapide et cochon alors pourquoi pas le Harey's sur crémazie on était tout proche. En rentrant, il y a une fille qui passe la moppe... le caissier et le cuisinier. Je dis au caissier....J'ai oublié les coupons Harvey's chez moi....tsé dans d'autres chaînes de restos ils te disent ok et te font le spécial...mais PAS LÀ :(. Bref, on a commandé 2 hamburgers angus trio et 2 hamburgers fromage suisse et champignons.   Par la suite arrive une autre cliente arrive. Le caissier prend sa commande. Et ensuite un autre...Je vois nos burgers prêt mais le caissier ne peux pas les faire car il sert du monde à la caisse. La fille passe encore la moppe et un autre client arrive...la fille le connais alors ils jasent. Ça fait 10 minutes qu'on attend. On a au moins nos boissons. Le caissier met les gants pour nous faire nos burgers...mais doit les enlever...un autre client. F*ck... Le cuisinier regarde la file...il est comme WTF...dis au caissier...euh la fille parle ..Lui ses trucs sont sous contrôle. Il y a full de burgers, frites, fridelles, rondelles..etc etc dans le réchaud.  La personne qui attendait dans l'auto de la cliente après nous rentre dans le resto et cri : \" WHY IT'S SO FCKING LONG TO HAVE FCKING 3 POUTINES\" je ne suis pas trop bonne en anglais mais ça ressemblait à cela...on a largement dépassé le 15 minutes. Un autre client...ayoye. On est enfin servi...mais tsé faire un hamburger au caissier...ça lui prend du temps...et on en a 4. Finalement après 20-25 minutes, on a enfin eu nos hamburgers froid biensûre ainsi que les rondelles et fridelles. On allait pas se mettre à chialer et les changers on ne voulait quand même pas dormir au Harvey's. Je me suis dit que j'allais faire le sondage de service à la clientèle sur la facture...mais ils en avaient pas. Et malheureusement arrivant chez moi, l'encre de la facture qui donne le courriel ou écrire pour les commentaires du restos était à moitié effacé. Anyways, Yelp est là pour cela.   Bref, désolé pas de photos, j'ai manqué de batterie :(."}
{"text":"when you are on the go and just want to grab something to eat and keep on going then Harveys is always a good choice.  The toppings are fresh, and their quality is good.  I grew up eating this stuff, as a matter of fact when i was a teenager, i worked here flipping burgers and shaking fries.  Just about anything you try here will be decent value for the money but i miss the old days when they had steak sandwiches.  But that bacon double cheeseburger i had last night was a good one for sure, and i always get the pickles on the side.   That is one place these guys shine, when they say top it any way you like and you actually can, and they do it right in front of you so there is no way you wont get enough of a good thing."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I ordered the pulled pork on a classic burger. It sure didnt look like the picture. There was barely any pulled pork on the sandwich, it was like the ghost of pulled pork stepped on my burger and left some kind of barbecue sauce ectoplasm just to insult me. I should have complained.  Next time i will tell them make it look like the one in the picture.  I paid extra for the pulled pork but probably could have got a similar result with just asking for barbecue sauce which is free.  Big time fail, big time let down."}
{"text":"ordered 2 cheeseburgers, was served something without cheese that wasn't a burger. Told them repeatedly (3x) this order was wrong, but was ignored.  Its forgiveable to get an order wrong, its not forgiveable to insist the wrong order was right, while holding a receipt as evidence. Received two disgusting, inedible loose meat sandwiches for $27, instead of cheeseburgers. Had to throw out the order, it was revolting.  I contacted Harvey's customer service, and they did not respond. I wrote them an angry email complaining they didn't respond, and then they did send a desultory, useless reply. At that point, I was no longer interested in getting any kind of resolution.  I don't eat at Harvey's anymore, and I hope this location specifically closes and the location repurposed to better use. I think this was an outrageous ripoff and 100% their fault."}
{"text":"As a Ryerson student, I've frequented this location several times and I gotta say, I've consistently been disappointed by the horrible service that I've gotten here. It's perhaps been the worst I've ever gotten from any fast food chain! The food is borderline acceptable but the service is just terrible.   Every staff member here is rude, has attitude, and gives off what is commonly known as \"the bitch face\". From every interaction, whether it be with the employees or even (presumably) the boss, I get a very strong feeling that they don't want to be there and that they hate their jobs. I came here because of their new launch of the \"build your own bowl\" concept and when I asked the cashier questions about \"what rice do you use, brown or white?\", she replied \"what do you mean? i don't know\"... and then along the production line, I asked the girl who was assembling my bowl \"what is that topping?\" and she also apathetically replied \"uhhh.. I don't really know\". Great.   The girl assembling my bowl also was very conservative with the toppings, giving only tiny scoops (unless I specifically asked for more). She almost looked like she was frowning the entire time, did not give me a fork to eat with, put my bowl on the counter next to my tray and then passive aggressively looked at me to insinuate I should take the tray..??   Yea, overall, a terrible experience. The bowl itself was extremely underwhelming. I got the rice base with angus beef (which is basically just the burger patty cut up in to chunks) and an assortment of toppings. The ONLY perk of this entire experience was the free guac but asides from that, the bowl was pretty disappointing. Cold, small portions, and just overall lackluster. I don't see this staying on the menu for too long and I would NOT recommend getting it, you're better off at Chipotle downstairs."}
{"text":"Frankly quite unimpressed, and this is coming from an American with regular exposure to McDonald's. I don't typically review chain fast food places, but I have never previously tried a Harvey's and figured that such a review may help out any American who finds themselves in Mississauga.   First impressions: nice layout, good parking availability at this one, easy to find on the corner of Dundas & Winston Churchill. For any American, this will seem kind of like a hybrid of a fast food burger place and a sandwich / sub place. You order on one end and then they'll move you down the line to customize whatever you're getting.   Service: nothing really noteworthy one way or another; I mean people aren't usually super stoked to work at a fast food joint. Typical service by all accounts. Somehow even though I clearly said that I wanted a burger and poutine, that got lost in translation even though the cashier was clearly looking at me and heard me. I had just run 4 km, so I wasn't really in the mood to get back in line to get it. This is Canada, poutine is everywhere.   Price: normal prices for Canada. Americans may balk at the raw price, but remember that it would be cheaper in USD.   Food: okay, here's where all the stars start going downhill. As a disclaimer, I am not a picky eater. I prefer value to fancy ingredients, but there's a limit to everything. I got the mushroom Swiss melt (original, not Angus). I don't typically put anything on these types of burgers, which is my favorite combination by the way. But I like to get the product as marketed on the fancy images, so I got it with pickle, onion, and tomato (the lettuce just didn't seem too palatable at the moment). Coincidentally, those three things were probably the best parts of the burger. Cheese was weak and virtually nonexistent. Patty was highly processed, more so than an average American fast food joint and accordingly had that very perturbing rubbery texture. Mushrooms were also incredibly rubbery and had clearly been sitting in some kind of preserving sauce kind of thing that overpowered their normal flavor. Bun was fine, did its best to hold the fort down. I am a big poutine person and not picky about it at that, so had I actually gotten that as originally requested, this probably would have been a 3-star review. Unfortunate that I don't really have any intentions of returning."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.  There was one customer in front of me and one staff member serving him. Aside from him there were no fewer than six employees all trying to look busy. My food was ready within a minute of my order, and they put it under the heat lamp. Ten minutes later it was still there. One woman cleaned everything in sight rather than serve customers... and everything was already clean!!!"}
{"text":"Harvey's chumps any charbroiled fast food place in Cali. Key word I said fast-food because NOTHING beats a charbroiled burger from Barneys. BUT HARVEY'S IS SO GOOD!! Charbroiled and fresh. I like how you order and then you stand there and tell them exactly what condiments you want on your burger. We had the bacon cheeseburgers and fries. A fat kids DREAM!! My only problem with was my fries were over done and NOBODY AND I REPEAT NOBODY in Toronto puts enough ice in my drinks. I'm serious about this...those Canadians have an issue when it comes to giving me enough ice. Other then that everything was good. We went twice while I was in town..the 2nd time by my request...Great for a quick, hot and fresh bite!"}
{"text":"harvey's classique. Le meilleur hamburger des grandes chaînes de fastfood à mon avis."}
{"text":"Had to do \"THE STOP\" to grab a quick bite and meet up with a friend, it was this or Tim Hortons as they are connected.  Went through the drive thru got a simple burger with bacon and cheese frie and drink. The burger was okay not that delicious juicy patty it used to once be. The oil needed to be changed for the fries it tasted super funky.  Pros the guy gave me a 100 napkins which is now in my glove box lol."}
{"text":"Being from Indiana, this is only the second time that I have ever been to a Harvey's, and the first time that I ordered something other than poutine (although I did order poutine). The burgers were actually pretty great--they tasted more like something you would get at a back yard cookout and less like the fake stuff that you would get at your neighbourhood McDonald's.   Though the outside looks pretty dated, the inside is fairly modern. They have a Pepsi machine that is reminiscent of the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine (the touchscreen fountain dispenser that can customize drinks with cherry/vanilla/etc. syrups).   The employees that were there when we came in were friendly and quick and attentive to their jobs.  Overall, for the value, this was a pretty good place to get a good, quick meal for a fair price. We'll definitely be back the next time that we're in Mississauga."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Harvey's that I've been to.  The service is always efficient and the burgers are consistently well-made."}
{"text":"Ordered a fish sandwich. There were many fruit flies flying around the lettuce and tomato containers behind the counter. I didn't want to be a spoiled elitist because so many people go hungry every day. So I took the sandwich home, removed the tomatoes and lettuce and ate it. The sandwich itself tasted fine but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"My wife is big on Harvey's while myself I'm sort of indifferent to it.  This location at on Dixon where Cityview meets has been here for quite some time.  The drive through is sort of a strange deal because it goes around a business which is at the end of a strip mall type structure while the inside is irregularly shaped  (pie?).  The place can be extremely busy especially if there's something going on at the Toronto Congress center which is basically just down the street.  This area in general has a lot of airport and convention traffic so the restaurant itself is or can be as busy as the area is at any given time.  Harvey's has flame grilled burgers and being a Cara company the standards are pretty much the same across the board.  Burgers, fries, onion rings etc are all good and I like the fact that their bottles of water are almost 600ml as opposed to just 500ml.  Tell them what you want on your burger as far as toppings, sauces etc since it's all made to order.  The angus burgers are larger than just your \"original\" and the texture just seems less processed than the original burgers.  Frings which are fries and rings combo are an extra cost?  They've added different drinks and even fried mini doughnuts kind of like what Swiss Chalet has just not on a plate with drizzle and whipped cream.  Watch your step as you leave the restaurant as to not get run over... the drive through is around the entrances."}
{"text":"I'm a whole foods person - I don't eat fast food, junk food, processed food or anything artificial. That said.....every once in a while you just want a junk burger.     Went and got some (plus onion rings).     I hate myself a little now, but I loved it while it was going down.   LOL People are always quite nice that work there, which is an unexpected little bonus.     Stuff is made per order so nothing is sitting around - another little bonus."}
{"text":"Were hamburgers at Harvey's always this juicy?  I haven't stepped into a Harvey's in a while and even though Harvey's is technically a fast food restaurant (which I don't usually post about), I think this juicy hamburger warrants a post from me.  We ordered the Original Harvey's burger combo and an extra Original Burger for me.  I remember advertisements in the past where Harvey's boasted the fact that they have all their burgers customizable and you can add whatever toppings you want on top of the burger.  I added pickles, tomatoes, lettuce, relish, mustard to my cheeseburger and it was so juicy.  The beef patty was so tender!  I was impressed."}
{"text":"It's a Harvey,  it fairly big.... food is good, fairly clean. Service is quick. I see no major flaws.   They have more options to dress your burger which is pretty good."}
{"text":"Best Harvey's location! Super clean and fresh ingredients! I go out of my way to go to this location. Staff are friendly as well."}
{"text":"Ok food. But had to repeat my self several times while ordering. Still got the wrong food. Didn't have time to talk to the manager. Worst Harvey's in my experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed dining at this Harvey's location. I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich and of course they were out of crispy chicken at like 7pm (go figure!). I had to wait a little (approximately 15 minutes) to get my sandwich. The guy who took my order however was a real nice and kept on apologizing for pain of having to wait to devour extreme DELICIOUSNESS! And DELICIOUS it was! Well worth the wait!   Besides service, the food they crank out here is always delicious, fresh and never that greasy feel of most burgers. You can always make your Hamburger a Beautiful Thing by adding any condiment of your choice! Winning! :)"}
{"text":"The drive thru is open an hour longer than the 'dine in' hour so I tend to make use of it after late night classes. They changed their menu and now its extra charge for cheese,sauteed mushroom,etc instead of having cheeseburgers on the actual menu..which is the same thing I guess. The gravy used for poutine can be burnt sometimes but their cheese curds are always satisfactory.Ask for frings with your combo if you can't decide between fries and onion rings."}
{"text":"Cheap,cheap,cheap. Had to ask to get a second slice of tomato, second pickle, and more than two pieces of cucumber for my salad bowl. Next time driving up airport road to get to the bovaird and airport road location."}
{"text":"I ordered their veggie burger and it was fresh and tasty. Harvey's is one of the few fast food joints that serves vegan burgers and they taste great. Their fries and onion rings are vegan too! The store itself is clean and the service is friendly. Not sure why all the negative reviews."}
{"text":"I think I've lost my love for Harvey's after trying all these new \"gourmet\" burger joints. I had the double angus beef burger with cheese and the combo was close to $10+tax.  It tasted alright.  I wasn't like \"oh wow, this is amazing\".  Maybe these new gourmet burger joints have spoiled me.    However, I think to give them props for quick service. There was a lady in front of me who ordered like $100 worth of burgers and fries for like $60 since she had coupons.  Immediately, they called someone else to help so I wouldn't have to wait.  This shows great management.    Verdict: It's a fast food and better than McD's and BK, but not even close to the same league as the new gourmet burger joints"}
{"text":"On the outside it looks OK but once you go in, all you see is q low lite store, very dark, it doesn't look clean or tidy. Counters are not well organised and to be honest, people working there had a very non professional appearance.  The place really looked dirty. Milkshakes and Slushyshakes don't look anything like the ad and the taste was bad. Too much sugar and colorants. I won't go there anymore"}
{"text":"Service was long salad was small and expensive there a new bowl combo not worth it to staffs disorganized"}
{"text":"I discovered today that Harvey's not only makes your hamburger a beautiful thing but the fish sandwich was also beautiful.  It is possible to order fairly healthy food here with toppings like lettuce, tomato and cucumber on a multigrain bun and a salad side order.  Okay, full disclosure: I chose the onion rings instead of the salad because they are so good!  The cashier and person who prepared my sandwich with my chosen toppings were both friendly.  The meal deal coupons that come in the mail every few months allow me to get the meal for only $5.99 including a side order and drink.  So I love this place - fresh, tasty, reasonably priced fast food.   Too bad they don't offer Coke Zero instead of Pepsi products."}
{"text":"This looks like a newer location of the Harvey's Swiss Chalet brand.  Harvey's shtick is that you order your sandwich and then the counter people assemble the condiments to order in front of you at one of 3 condiment stations.  I know it is a lot of pressure, but please be ready with your condiment order BEFORE you step to the station.  I like coming to Harvey's because they are one of the few places to offer relish as a condiment.  Their house special sauce is also pretty good."}
{"text":"Typical fast food burger joint - wish the fries were still fresh cut. Bonus is that one can customize the sandwich toppings."}
{"text":"Have been to this location many a times and every time the food and service does not disappoint. I always use the CAA coupon special for 4 burgers, fries and drinks for under $22 + taxes. We sometimes replace the fries with a poutine. We also have veggie burgers all the time.   The staff is courteous and the people who put the burgers together with toppings are nice and don't cringe in the toppings. If the tomato slice is smaller, they will add more and so on.   The burgers are done perfectly and fries are fresh and hot. The tables are clean. This time we replaces the fries with onion rings. They go well as a topping in the burgers!! The make your own Pepsi is a good to have but useless to us as the kids and Mrs take the milk and I take only the soda water.   Value for money and a quality that far surpasses the quality of any of the competitors."}
{"text":"I saw their 2 for $6 burger deal sign so I walked in. I ordered their veggie burger. As most people already know, Harveys cook their burger as you order them, and you get to top it your way. Veggie burgers were fresh and delicious.  Their veggie burgers are vegan (just watch out for the sauces). Their fries and onion rings are vegan too! Check out their allergy guide online for more info.  Place itself is clean & cozy. Service is friendly. Overall an amazing alternative to McD and BK."}
{"text":"What's not to like for two burgers fries or onion rings and two drinks for $11+ taxes for CAA members?  They will give us Veggie Burgers on a whole grain bun and all the toppings we like including guacamole and tzatziki. We top with onion rings and sometimes even with fries!  The burgers delicious, perfectly cooked fries and onion rings and we sometimes upgrade the fries to a Poutine of which the gravy is vegetarian as well.   The location was clean, staff cheerful and the manager on duty who had to help out the cashier was even better!"}
{"text":"The best hamburger chain in all of Canada. Surpasses the quality of international chains such as McDonald's and Burger King due to their use of fresh ingredients and the process of preparing your meal is done in front of your eyes.  Although I do not consume red meat, their chicken sandwiches are amazingly good and I love the fact that the workers listen to what you want on your sandwich instead of following a construction diagram on the wall.  This location is located next to the Ramada Hotel on Jarvis, a block south of Alan Gardens.  Place is kept clean and service is good."}
{"text":"This review is for their breakfast.  I ordered an \"egg and cheese breakfast burger\" and the sign said $4.99.    As I watch the cashier punch it in, she puts in \"breakfast burger\" and then adds \"egg and cheese\" which adds $0.50 and it was slightly under $7.00 This made no sense to me as it said \"Egg and Cheese burger\" for $4.99.  It didn't say egg and cheese is extra $0.50. If they said \"this only comes with egg and cheese and beef is extra\" and saw them punch in a button called \"meat\" for additional charges, I would totally understand. But this wasn't the case.   The employees there were coming up with all these weird reasons as for why it was so much and why they punched in \"egg and cheese\".  I actually pointed out the button/charges that shouldn't be there.  I didn't tell them right away as I don't like to be invasive, but after 3-4 minutes, I finally chimed in as to what the problem was.   I pointed to the sign numerous time and none of the staff could answer my question - they all had conflicting answers.    To the staff's credit, they did finally charge me the right amount ($4.99 + tax).  And the burger itself was actually very good for a breakfast burger.  I quite enjoyed it.  Slim beef patty, egg and cheese on a slightly sweet bun.    My problem and the reason for the two stars is: a) Head office for Harvey's either did not put proper signage ; or b) The owner/manager of this store did not give proper training to his staff; or c) Head office for Harvey's did not give proper/clear instructions to this location for it's breakfast pricing; or  d) The owner/manager knows this but is just punching in \"egg and cheese\" to get an extra 0.50 (for some reason I was the first person to point this out - note to others $5.00 + plus tax should not be over $6!!!); or; e)Any combination of the above.    I am hoping they have this rectified and I will go visit again and update the review accordingly."}
{"text":"Nice quiet, clean Harvey's location located two blocks north of the intersection of Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue.  Same, typical fare offered as other locations in the chain.  Next door to a series of fast food restaurants such as Tim Horton's and Pizza Pizza, this location serves the community well location-wise as there is not another Harvey's for at least another 2 kilometers.Compared to McDonalds and Burger King, Harvey's sandwiches are superior due to the freshness of their ingredients and the fact that they are prepared to your liking in front of your eyes. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Decent food and decent prices. The crowd can often be very scumbaggish though."}
{"text":"The place has a icky vibe about it, which one could ignore if the service was great. However, it's not. They denied that another franchise carried a particular item, even claiming that one of the employees worked there which is how they knew we were wrong. A complaint that went to their head office resulted in an disingenuous \"I'm sorry\" message left on voicemail, which also insinuated that they simply made a mistake. I guarantee I will never even step inside this location because if you don't have the decency to be honest, I'm not giving you my money."}
{"text":"Quick fast and reliable. Its a Harveys burger. Good clean and fresh.  Always find the customer service and wait time a little slow at this location.  Reliable joint for a quick burger."}
{"text":"I stopped in for the Great Canadian Bacon Burger, but the cashier was busy at the drive through window, so I talked myself down to a regular Great Canadian Burger.  I was impressed that unlike other Harvey's the burger was not ready in 2 seconds (a big vat of precooked burgers is very common)  But the staff ignored me (more servicing the drive through window) until my burger was cooked. I can't remember the name of it, but Harvey's used to make a Great Canadian burger with fried onions on it, it was fantastic, it actually tasted like it came from a restaurant. Unfortunately the regular Great Canadian tasted nothing like it. I tried to spice it up (I think that Harvey's used to charge extra for the mesquite sauce, but I got it free with hot sauce) For a $6.00 burger I was expecting way more, they were cheap with the toppings, I was glad I didn't bother getting any sides.  Anyways, this location is alright I suppose if you are going to the drive through and you like small burgers with minimal toppings."}
{"text":"I like to have something in my stomach before getting on the road to go home. Being nearby to some gas stations this is a good place to go for that quick meal. Their burgers are ok, nothing too impressive. I enjoy how you get to make your own/add your own toppings of your choice on the fly. A lot of places around here want you to make up your mind when you order, however my mind changes to frequently I may not want those grilled onions in 2 minutes, who knows?? This location seems to be kept in pretty good order and a worker came out every so often to check tables and sweep the floor which shows they care at least  a little on the surface.  Good little burger joint, but by no means above the rim in terms of excellent cooked dead cow between yeast and flour."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Harvey's I've ever been to. The staff are extremely nice and helpful. The food is always fresh and awesome! I would rather pick this Harvey's over McDonalds or any of those overpriced hamburger joint. Try the Buffalo Chicken, it is amazing."}
{"text":"Terrible experience! From the unprofessional order taking, one girl asks me what I want to order, as I began speaking she walks away and another one shows up.... Weird!!! Then, to finding out after our food was bagged,  that the kids meals do NOT come with a TOY!?! It says so on the menu, it's EVEN high lighted on the menu! And we paid over $5 per combo! For what? The toy is typically calculated into the cost... AND EVERY KIDS MEAL, at EVERY FAST FOOD JOINT COMES WITH TOY! I should have had those cheap ass' explain it to my 3 and 7 year old! We paid full price. I expect  to get my money's worth.   We also did not appreciate, while sitting in, waiting for our children to eat, a verbal broke out between a customer and the Asian cashier, that she over charged her, that went on and on, and once the customer got her food and left the employees would not stop discussing it, not only was that completely unacceptable  and unprofessional! And annoying for us and our young children to listen to!  But whether she was charged 1 cent or 1$ more, the customer had every right to be upset and bring it up. It's the customers money!   This place needs a face lift. And a good cleaning. Would literally never return.   GROSS!"}
{"text":"The burgers are great here, my go to place especially when they release coupons or in-store specials! Wide assortment of toppings such as lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, pickles, cucumbers, black olives, jalapenos, hot peppers and tons of sauces to choose from. I usually get everything on mine, get your money's worth.   Huge improvement from the disgusting lettuce and mayo filled burgers at McDonald's and Burger King."}
{"text":"I try to avoid fast food chains in general but once in a while I make an exception for Harvey's and the reason is: Chili peppers!  Yes, one of my universal rule in life is \"Everything is better with hot peppers\" and this certainly applies to fast food chain's burgers!  What I like at Harvey's is that they have their customization station where you can tell what you want and don't want in it. I always insist on \"lots of peppers\" and ask them to put more if there is not enough. Chili peppers do wonder in masking the cheap meat taste!  This location is small but convenient for a quick stop along the A-40! It was clean and quick when we visited."}
{"text":"Harvey's is not my favourite fast food burger but when I get a burger at Harvey's it never disappoints."}
{"text":"The service was a little slow! We waited about 15 minutes to get our check! Absolutely ridiculous. But overall a good little local bar. Good food and Music ."}
{"text":"I agree with Karl R. 100%   Expat Torontonian (is that correct ?) here..who remembers Harvey's from when he was a kid, and gets Harveys every change he gets on a trip to Toronto.   You either like them or you don't. The texture of the beef patty beef isn't like any other burger joint. I think they mix in some veggie soybean stuff in there..but whatever they do the taste to me is excellent ! I have found some like it and some don't. But if you do, you really like it, which is me.   The stores are like BK as they are no frills tables, and seating.   I currently live in Florida, and we won't have anything like Harvey's in the States. So enjoy you Canucks, your lucky to have Harvey's up there.   Can't wait to introduce my family to a Harvey's burger. I'll let you know what they say."}
{"text":"Finally found a convenient-to-transit Harvey's. I ordered lunch and it took like one minute to get the burger. I thought \"oh great, it's been sitting around waiting for me\" but it was actually fresh. Good timing I guess. Quite a bit of seating in the food court. Added to the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"This location has the most confused staff I have ever seen. There are two employees who can never ring in my order (and I'm ordering stuff on the menu, not any crazy secret crap that shouldn't be programmed into the register). They always need to get someone else to ring it in but they never ever go and get help. They stand there and stare blankly at the register until another employee eventually notices they don't know what they are doing. There's a lady who works the grill that I've witness verbally abusing staff members on two occasions. I don't know what her issue is but she seems like a proper b*tch. She does, however, produce an amazing fresh, juicy burger. I keep going back because the food at this location is always fresh and delicious. It's a good lunch option but budget yourself an extra five minutes for staff issues, just in case."}
{"text":"J'adore Harvey's! J'aime bcp leurs hamburgers !! Service à la clientèle très ordinaire des jeunes qui y travail! Service très lent!"}
{"text":"Came with my colleague for a Harvey's burger. Ordered the Original Bacon and Cheese Burger with Fries and Drink. Although I get to choose what toppings I wanted, I feel like they don't put enough. My colleague got his Chicken Burger on a whole wheat bun. Apparently, you have to ask for whole wheat, which I didn't even know it existed. Burger was good, the meat definitely taste grilled compare to other restaurants. Drinks are self-serve so you can refill as much as you want. If you have Scene card, you can get points. If you are on Scenes newsletter, you get coupons for more points. You can also go on their website to print out coupons."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Harvey's in ages, since their soggy fries day, so a visit to this childhood fave was long overdue. Avenue road is a good walk, full of great little stores and restaurants, so I'm sure to some degree Harvey's (and the Swiss Chalet attached) gets ignored. The store is fairly small.   Upon entering you are greeted with the menu and cashier. Standard Harvey's fare. I tried the veggie burger (actually really good, better than I previously thought - though Lick's veg burgs are better), fries (crispy and good, I still miss the soggy ones), and salad (meh, standard). And best of all, you get free refills on soda pop! I'm always afraid to ask, but I did this time and was rewarded! The pop served us well on our 5km walk to our destination..."}
{"text":"Very clean location.  Service is usually good and fast! The buffalo chicken sandwich on a multigrain bun is my jam. I appreciate that they don't question my desire for five pickle slices.  Sole complaint: Drive-thru staff is often inaccurate."}
{"text":"Best Fast Food Store!  This location deserves a shout out. Walking into this location causes my senses to overload.   The staff at this location are friendly, attentive and always striving to keep this restaurant very clean. The quality of the food is consistent, fresh tasting and ALWAYS hot.  I have been here several times and have even driven past other Harvey's to purchase food at this location.  This could be the greatest fast food store in Ontario. My hat is off to all the staff that work at this location. You are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh burgers and fries. The quality of the burgers makes me upset there isn't one in the states lol. An ideal option for a quick-ish bite to eat and won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"Awesome, if you live in oakridges. Best place to go because of its service and quick preparation."}
{"text":"Man, I wanted to give you 5 stars but you guys tricked me.  The service was good and the food was as well but while my companion and I were eating, a staff member approached and asked us if we could fill out a survey then she gave us apple pie vouchers.  OBVIOUSLY I gave them a good survey; i mean FREE apple pie?!  But then when I went to submit the survey and get the apple pie, homegirl was like, \"Nuh uh, u can use this on your NEXT visit.\"  I was like, \"oh come on! dont gimme that corporate store policy schtick! we both know ur gonna toss 17 apple pies at the end of the night. Your burgers are far superior to any franchise burger, but don't get it twisted and think that your apple pies are worth a damn. Keep your pie."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger joints because the burgers are real meat and made to order on the fire grill and the employees put the toppings you want on the burger right in front of you. Really enjoy eating here whenever I want a burger and freshly cut fries."}
{"text":"Went to this location and was quite disappointed.   Employees were generally clueless and not trained well. They did not even know their own menu. In addition, two of them barely spoke english which was a bit frustrating. Also, they initially got our order wrong. I ordered the original burger and it was average like many other Harvey's restaurants.   My fiancé ordered one of their chicken burgers. When we got home and she took her burger apart to add ketchup, we found that the side of the chicken was completely cold and raw because it had flipped over and the cook did not bother to spread it properly in order to ensure that all of the meat gets cooked.   I would not recommend this location whatsoever."}
{"text":"The people were not friendly at all All garbage cans were filled and no where to put trash I ordered a smoothie.  It was just crushed ice and flavored sugar water. I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"I'm giving my husband driving lessons and we stopped here to grab something to eat during a break on 07 November 2017 at around 14:20.  We have been here before, the staff is quite friendly and the place is respectably clean.  We ordered 2 kid burgers (husband), 1 hot dog (me) and 1 Frings (Onion rings and French fries) to share.  As usual, the staff was friendly, and we received our meal in an orderly fashion.  While my husband was letting the server know what he wants on his burgers, I noticed my order was sitting under the 'hot lamps'.  Then it was my turn to let the server know what I wanted on the hot dog.  Then she went to get the Frings,  put onion rings in one half and French fries in the other half......by the time we sat at the table, my hot dog was cold!   Oh, by the way, my husband passed his drivers test today on 09 November 2017!"}
{"text":"Great tasting burgers and/or delectable edibles your heart (or stomach) desires. The music they play is the most varied I've ever heard for any fast food place which is odd from new pop to old unusual songs or ambience type music.   The prices are as expected these days but I love using he coupons"}
{"text":"Let me say I love Harveys their chains in Toronto seems to be all closing up theres only 3 locations in downtown core left. This location left me with a bad taste. The oil was bad awful so anything fried like fries, onion rings, apple pie tasted not so good. The food here was not up to par from what I used to have. The customer service here is excellent to change ur oil often is good to keep customers coming back."}
{"text":"This is our day to day hangout for a \"quick fix\" of shareable Poutine and a burger. Make sure you come out with your combo coupons for a deal as opposed to paying full value. Also, you will be able to collect an additional few scene points ( literally, a few) at the cash and you'll get a print out with your cumulative points to date.   It is always interesting to see a staff of 5 behind the counter with barely anyone there at the time we came in today. This may either show a commitment to good service levels or the scheduler needs to improve the software  to avoid hemorrhaging costs."}
{"text":"When you walk in the establishment it reeks of urine   Please change the mop head and clean the facilities   I walked right out"}
{"text":"I keep hoping things will improve at this location.  After a \"renovation\" from what seems to be the lowest bidder, I thought the quality and cleanliness would improve. Well, not the case. The staff are kind but the food is bland (a Corporate issue) and the floor is disgusting. Officially, this was my last visit. Major thumbs down. Also.. and this is odd. But on several occasions,  when you first walk in, it smells like a bathroom. That spectacular aroma of cleaner mixed with human waste. Just what you want while eating a meal.   Please. Give this place a thorough hosing."}
{"text":"Fast and accurate service. They have WiFi available. There is plenty of seating available. The negative was that the seating is retro and desperate needs of an upgrade. Also the time that we arrived, some of the tables were not cleaned. They take AMEX and Apple Pay."}
{"text":"Good deals all the time at Harvey's. Burgers taste great, fries are usually fresh. This location has some sketchy characters, but nonetheless its still a good place to eat. They offer free wifi, pretty fast and reliable. Upgrading to poutine is never worth it, they make the poutines small now. The location is small, but seating is usually available, and fairly clean. Noise level fluctuates, but usually normal for a fast-food restaurant.  Tip: type Harvey's coupon offers into your iPhone search in Safari and you will receive many offers. Check the expiry dates, and use a relevant coupon for your order; just dhow your iPhone screen with the coupon. Saved me tons.  Oh yes! This location is infamously known as Hooker Harvey's, because historically it was frequented by street workers; although, nowadays street workers have moved their enterprises to digital mediums; thus, the nickname Hooker Harvey's no longer carries the same weight, making it a misnomer."}
{"text":"Visiting family here in Brampton from out of country, somebody mentioned Harvey's so we went there. Hands down one of the worst fast food experiences I've ever had to deal with. The tall lanky brown kid (who might've been the manager) had the worst demeanor and body language I've ever seen from any employee. Just yelling at employees and overall sh*t attitude. Each one of the employees looks like they hate their job, especially that brown kid. Food was below average, didn't finish it. Definitely won't ever go back."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????join???????????SUBWXY+M?????????????????????????????????????????????M???????d la."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch. This place is just A-OK. To start, I'm not a fan at all of harveys beef burgers so I decided to get the grilled chicken sandwich combo instead - my total ended up being $9.89. I am a picky eater so having to tell people I only want lettuce and tomato on my sandwich seems to be very strange for them and I always feel judged! Ugh  Anyways..the gentleman who took my order was very friendly and quick..I can see why they would keep him at cash during the lunch rush. Once my order was passed on I watched the girl in front of me get her toppings on her burger. Half way through she asked her friend if they were staying to eat or getting take out and they decided to stay in so she politely asked the lady helping her if she could get her order for take out instead. The lady had no expression and asked the gentleman taking the orders for a tray instead..he smiled and said to the lady \"i asked her if she wanted take out or not\" to which the lady responded back to him something that made him laugh. I found that very very rude in front of customers and I could tell the girl in front of me felt she was being of inconvenience to them - NO CUSTOMER SHOULD FEEL THIS WAY.  Moving on..I got my order taken at 11:44 and waited until 11:54 to get my grilled chicken sandwich and fries. I don't think I should have to wait 10 whole minutes during lunch to get my burger. I do understand that these are \"freshly\" made but harveys needs to find a way to pre-cook halfway their chicken and then finish it off in the girl so that everyone can get there orders done in a timely manner.   This place would have gotten higher stars if their customer service was better and if I had gotten my order in a timely fashion and not have to had watch 8 other customers get their orders before me."}
{"text":"Far beyond the best Harvey's location in Mississauga. Good customer service, amazing staff, friendly, affordable, great food! Def highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was not happy with the girls in the front of the cash.  There's a Indian girl whom was making fun of my moms akcent with the rest of the staff.  I wouldn't come here if it was the last restaurant in the world!!!!!!!!!!  Shame on those whom are racist."}
{"text":"I love Harvey's but today's experience left me disappointed. I ordered a veggie burger with no cheese on a multigrain bun. Take a look at the photo... it's on a white bread with cheese. I ordered it to-go and didn't realize that until I got home. Also, I looked at my receipt and was charged $0.80 for cheese when I didn't want it!! I would say, if you're going to order, make sure you say it LOUDLY because this Harvey is at a food court location. I am giving them a 2 star, despite the mistake, my food still tasted decent."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Harvey's locations that I've been to. The service is quick, the staff polite, and the food always fresh. Plenty of parking in front and conveniently located. As for some of the recent changes the chain itself made, I prefer the shredded lettuce to the whole leaves, and I think the staff do too judging by how they fumble with trying to separate the leaves (just a small thing, but a thing)."}
{"text":"This Harvey's location meets with the quality and consistency you'd expect from an outlet in the chain. Service is good and reasonably fast. Food is good and fresh."}
{"text":"I agree with the review from Jill. I can't believe how this restaurant has gone down hill. They recently renovated the seating area, so we at least don't have to sit on broken seats any more. They probably should have done some renovations to their kitchen. Everything looks pretty nasty behind the counter.  I was there a few days ago. The lettuce is welted, onions soggy and tomatoes were like mush. Toppings were all mixed together and the girl was just slapping toppings on our burgers and making a big old mess. Against our better judgment We ate our meals and ended up sick from it.   Don't know what's going on Harvey's, but you better step up your game.   I won't be returning to this location. There is another location at Kennedy and Lawrence. Their toppings look much fresher and even their burgers taste better.  UPDATED February 24, 2018 I decided to go back to this location because it is closest to my home. I can't believe I had another issue. My chicken fingers were burnt. The staff should be ashamed of themselves. If I were able to, I would have brought them right back."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had Harvey's due to some changes (leaf lettuce) and terrible service at another location but this visit has brought me back. Fast, very friendly and thoughtful service. And this location even has Swiss Chalet chicken.   Oh, and the shredded lettuce is back!"}
{"text":"A  very good, long-established Harvey's location. Service is good, food is fresh and consistent with what you'd expect from any Harvey's location. I prefer the old chopped lettuce to the new lettuce leaves they use. For that matter, they introduced sub toppings... for burgers... I don't think so."}
{"text":"This Harvey's location has been here for a long, long time and on every visit seems to deliver good, fast, and fresh food without so much as a snag."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! I am by no means the princess 5 star dining type, but even by fast food chain standards this place was terrible!   We should have gone with our gut instinct and left just as soon as we got there. However, we decided to brave the bin juice that had leaked all over the floor (I wish I was exaggerating, but sadly I am not!) and the tables filled with rubbish for our first experience at Harvey's.   Sadly, the service and food was no better than the filthy environment it was served in. We waited 15mins for cold fries and chargrilled, overcooked hot dogs. Please note that it was by no means busy, the staff were just moving at the same pace as ancient snails.  We won't be heading back to that Harvey's location, or any other location for that matter."}
{"text":"Swiss chalet here sucks.  NOT the Swiss Chalet Fries, drinks are double the price and are fountain drinks with no carbonation.  Avoid if you want a decent chalet supper."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Harveys on and off for about 19 years. I used to live in clarkson and would frequent it a lot in my teen years.  The layout is quite large and I would say is probably one of the larger Harveys in Mississauga with a ton of seating. Also is a standalone and not connected to a Swiss Chalet like most newer Harveys. Also has a drive thru.  The food is always fresh and tasty, I can't recall any really bad service over the years (altho my husband says that they always give him the ends of the pickles instead of the good ones lol)  What keeps me coming over other burger joints is the coupons and the scene points. kudos harveys  4/5"}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for years. It is slowly declining in service. The last time I was there for dinner, I was horrified to see the staff that cooks the food pick it up with their hands (without gloves or utensils) and I watched this happen over and over again. So we left! Completely unhygienic and gross. Not to mention the quality of the food is not up to the standards it used to be. Lettuce is wilted and not fresh and so are the other ingredients.  I will avoid this location from now on."}
{"text":"This is the closest location to my work, so naturally, most of the times I need to go out for lunch I go to this Harvey's. It doesn't feel as spacious as other locations, but I think this is typical of most places in Toronto.  It can get pretty busy inside, especially during the lunch hours.   Previously, I have never had any kinds of issues with this place.  But the last time I went, my order was completed wrong. I went through the drive thru and ordered 2 burgers. Lettuce, ketchup, onions, hot peppers, my usual.  There was no one in front of me and no one behind me when I ordered.  Even waiting at the window, no other car came up behind me.  But when I got back and opened my burgers, the topping was the complete opposite.  It wouldn't be a big deal, if an item was missed or something.  But  you didn't give me the toppings I asked for, instead it had mustard and pickles. I hate pickles. I thought maybe they messed up one, but nope, this was on both burgers.  This was a huge disappointment and nothing I could do about it afterwards. I contacted the head office and provided my info just asking if someone can explain what possibly could have happened here.  It seems like a very silly mistake given that I was the only one there at the time.  HO just advises that someone from location will contact you, but they never contacted me. And this is after following up with them 2 times.  Harveys is my fav burger place, but I will not be going to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Typical Harvey's never disappointed  Love the onion rings and poutine  Service is here is good drive through is quick as well good job guys !"}
{"text":"If you want ambience this isn't the place. But despite many of them being run down, Harveys has great burgers and they dress them the way you want them. Highly recommend their fried pickles and their Poutine!"}
{"text":"The first and last time I will be there. The bar maid looked past me like I was invisible. Then she went and asked patrons that was already serviced did they need anything else. Finally, she approach me and telepathically asked, \"can I help you?\" I stated, I was there for business. They owner HARVEY told my boss if he needed any quarters come up and get some if the banks where closed. She said, I don't believe it and walk away only to call Harvey. They conversed and she came back and said she has no extra quarters to exchanged. I went back and told my boss how rude this person was towards me. I found out later she told her boss Harvey that I was rude and that was the reason the transaction didn't take place. She lied for what reason?  I'm not from Duquesne. I don't live in Duquesne. I never visit that establishment. We don't know each other!!! If your not a token... Beware! Racism is still alive and thriving!"}
{"text":"About a 1-1.5: Harvey's is a Canadian fast food chain that is found in every province.  Their menu offers burgers, hot dogs, fries, onion rings, poutine, as well as frappes.  The hubs and I was in the area, and we saw a big lit-up burger sign, and we had to check  it out!  We got a combo with an Original Burger with cheese and bacon, upgraded the french fries to a bacon poutine, and a Pepsi-based beverage.  The burger itself, while piled high and 'dressed' (with all the fixings) to the max, was quite underwhelming.  The 'beef' patty had a weird texture, as it was soft (think of the McRib).  The poutine couldn't be finished, as the gravy was extremely watered down and basically ruined the taste of the fries.  The only thing I did enjoy was the crisp bacon strips, which were all cooked perfectly.  The soda fountain also had an issue with the carbonation, so the drinks all tasted like seltzer water.  Plenty of seating (a downstairs and an upstairs), with a lot for your car.  +off textured burger patty +watered down gravy for the poutine T___T"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday during lunch time rush hour. There was quite a line already, 2 cashiers taking orders and 2 employees serving to dress the burgers. They work at a quick speed so even though the line was long but the wait time wasn't too bad. I was in and got my food out in roughly 10mins.  The food tasted what it should as of other Harvey's franchaise locations."}
{"text":"This is the first result that comes up for Harvey's so I'll just use it as a general overview of the chain itself. As the first poster notes, there seems to have been a pull out of the chain in certain areas of downtown.  There's one in the bowels of the Eaton Centre's food court (the southern wing) although it's tucked around a corner and you have to get by the stank of the Sbarro to find it. Even if'in' you find the Harvey's there well good luck finding seating in the foodcourt area. Your better Harvey's play is kitty corner at the AMC Dundas 24 building on the foodcourt level (which appears to double as Ryerson's east wing cafeteria).  There is also one in one of the food courts in the financial district underground but I think it's only open Monday - Friday 11:45 am - 1:45 pm so forget about it.  Right. What is Harvey's? Well, it's one of the few burger chains that manage to match your mom 'n' pop stand alones that engender local loyalty (i.e., Etobicoke's Apache Burger). It's a bit like the American West coast's In 'n' Out burger or Seattle's Dicks.  Harvey's offers a flame broiled \"meat\" patty (not 100% beef as far as I can tell) made to order. You get to load the sucker up Subway sandwich style. They seem to have a policy to cater to \"extra\" and \"on the side\" requests with little complaint. Pickles on the side is usually a favorite request of some. I personally always ask for four scoops of onions and have never been turned down. (I do allay the food prep's fears about the societal consequences of eating so many onions by pointing out I'm single and won't be tormenting anyone with onion breath. I also have a theory that the extra onions contain sufficient cancer fighting enzymes that counter balance the carcinogens in the meat. But don't construe that as Kevin Trudeau style \"health\" advice.)  Harvey's sometimes follows the \"if it's not broken, we're going to try and fix it\" school of driving a good brand name into the toilet. Harvey's, for years, had some of the best fries around: a fresh cut potato fry with just the right amount of potato skin and crispiness. In the late 1990s/early 2000s they changed to this coated \"seasoned\" fries which were just awful. Awful. So awful I think I actually wrote my MP and the Queen a letter asking them if they could do something. A truly \"New Coke\" move. They seem to have brought something like the old fries back but not quite.  Harvey's should not be confused with Hardee's. The similarity in names actually prevented the Hardee's chain from expanding into Canada. So if you dream about tasting a Monster Thick Burger, you'll have to keep on dreaming.   All 'n' all, Harvey's has made some changes over the years in the \"not for the better\" category but it's still miles (errr kilometers) ahead of McDonald's and BK."}
{"text":"Harvey's is Harvey's. A good burger, loaded up the way you want it, and decent enough fries. Efficiently run. I don't think I've ever experienced any retard moments here. And since it's part of the Dundas/Yonge food court, huge variety in seating. Nice to grab a window seat and check out the Yonge street activity. And the food court has free wireless."}
{"text":"Very old school Harvey's. The place could use a reno. Classic orange decor designed by 1970s industrial psychologists, meant to get on your nerves shortly after you've consumed your meal and force you out. Love it.  That said. It's a Harvey's. Lots of parking. Easy traffic light access to get out."}
{"text":"They tried to give me old dry meat be careful make sure that you askfor fresh meats or they will give you the standby meats."}
{"text":"Just an ordinary hamburger franchise joint. Food is served fast, the place is clean, there's nothing remarkably good or bad. Which is good enough for me!"}
{"text":"Asked a simple question - the rude drive thru women slammed the sliding glass window in my face... Oh yeah? I'll take my money to McDonald's, no problem :)"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Prime reason I will not go to this place again. The drive thru and inside was full. Slowest service I have ever experienced. It took me 1 full hour (just ordered 2 veggie burgers) to leave and I went inside because the drive thru seemed long. They kept taking orders but people were waiting for the food. Some people who ordered after me got their food before me for some reason. Some people ahead of me were irritated because of that and asked for the managers contact information. The people assembling the burgers couldn't even put the toppings on right. I said no ice for the Pepsi I ordered yet I received one with ice so I told them. The guy then just dumped the ice and didn't put the lid on right which caused it to spill there.   Bottom line: service is the worst, go to a different location instead."}
{"text":"I have always like Harvey's as far as fast food goes. This location is clean and the staff is friendly. Prefer their burgers to other burger places"}
{"text":"I often order in from this Harvey's location, as I'm sure they can attest, there have been many burgers ordered and delivered.  First, Harvey's has AMAZING milkshakes. I mean really, a milkshake, none can really be bad. But these are great.  They would have gotten a full 5 star rating, just that unfortunately at times, the sizes are wrong, small instead of large drinks, small instead of large fries etc. It is just important to have the information read and directions followed. Occasionally incorrect toppings etc. But all in all, I'm happy with the food, so long as the burgers aren't overcooked almost being burnt which has happened.  The last few orders have been great, and very tasty is as usual with Harvey's, so no complaints there.   Nothing really bad to say here, they are about 95% accurate, which compared to other fast food chains, is pretty good in my opinion."}
{"text":"Il faut aimer le gout du hamburger de Harveys et c' est mon cas. Une fois par année je me gâte avec des rondelles d' oignons. Le restaurant a été rénové mais les mêmes vieux meubles semblent avoir été conservés. Les garnitures etaient tres fraiches. la caissiere n' était pas sympatique mais l' employés qui a monté mon burger etait amical et aimait son boulot."}
{"text":"Restaurent propre, repas chaud, employers aimables !! Bonne place pour savourer un buger!"}
{"text":"The only thing great about this plaza! Harvey's locations gets pretty rare and this one is nestled in a nice neighbourhood. Used the two can dine coupons at this place and it's so worth it. The people they hire at any Cara establishment are usually friendly. Haven't you all noticed this? I'll leave this at 5 stars for its staff and hot piping burger."}
{"text":"Great burger and just about the best poutine.  Service can be quicker.  I love the Angus with bacon.  They have a mint shake for christmas"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of burgers, but who isn't really. This spot has some pretty good options for fast food. You would think that Harvey's wouldn't be too popular when it is right next to a McDonald's, but this one is extremely popular. Personally, I love the options here. You can really customize your meal and get only the things that you like. Surprisingly, this place serves up some really tasty burgers."}
{"text":"This is where you should go if you don't like beef! I don't know what's in their burgers but it doesn't taste like beef at all. And for a fast food joint the service is awfully slow!"}
{"text":"How has nobody written about this Harvey's.   As a former Ry-high student, this place was (and still is) my go- to at lunch time. The lines are never too long (even at the 12-1 rush) and the veggie burgers are DELICIOUS.   Even my carnivore friends agree, Harvey's veggie burgers are the shit! IF you are feeling naughty, upgrade your side for 2 bucks and get a poutine. Veggie burger and poutine, sounds so wrong but feels so right.   So if you work/go to school/shop in the Yonge/Dundas area, don't forget about dear old Harveys in the AMC building foodcourt. For under 10 bucks, you will be stuffed full of delicious, customizable fast food. YUM!"}
{"text":"Not the best location, not the worst.  Staff aren't always the best at making small talk while waiting for Burgers so there's a lot of awkward silences.  Food has never disappointed and there's a small area for sitting. Parking is limited and most of the spots are next to the garbage bin but there is paid, street parking and a big No Frills lot just behind.  However, only Harvey's in the area so I'll take the silences and stinky parking as long as the food remains delicious."}
{"text":"May 31, 2018 - I go here once in a while for my lunch break. The food is good, I like the poutine. Also the employees are nice and friendly.   Always remember to use your Scene card!  There are a few employees who always ask if you have your scene card and some who don't. I forget to use it every time I go!    -_-"}
{"text":"Absolute gross food.  I got food poisoning.   Burger doesn't even taste like real meat makes me sick.  Also portions are small.   Fries soggy and old.   This is the worst place to get burgers.  I don't not recommended.  Dirty place with depressed staff.    Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite when walking by after work. The place looks pretty new and is in great shape and is clean.  The staff were quick, though the cashier didn't quite understand what I meant when I said \"I'd like to try the spicy onion bacon burger\". He thought I wanted a sample or something before I bought the burger. Definite language barrier.  Anyhow, the burger was good, but like all fast food burgers that claim to be spicy, this one was not."}
{"text":"Hooker Harveys. If you want to have some dirty fun, this may be the place to hang out after 10pm. But if you are craving a good yummy burger, stray away. My burger tasted like cardboard in a sock. Sigh. Maybe I am exaggerating. But I could have made that burger myself:   1. Buy a No-Name brand burger pattie from No Frills. 2. Keep it in the freezer for 5 months. 3. Take it out, thaw under hot water for 5 minutes. 4. Slap it between some burger buns with whatever.   That's how bad it was. Fries were unsalted ... and heavy. And unenjoyable. $7 wasted. \"Never\" coming back. Sorry Justin."}
{"text":"This place has a very nice design and is clean and new. The staff is friendly and courteous. I came in at the later part of lunch and it wasn't too busy which is nice. The food is on the the better end of fast food. You are able to choose the toppings you want which look good and taste fresh. It is more expensive than McDonald's but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I used to come here regularly when I worked in the area as I preferred the burgers here as opposed to at the other fast food places near this Harvey's restaurant (Burger King, Wendy's, and McDonald's). I'm not crazy about the Harvey's fries so will normally either have a salad or their onion rings.  On the day of my visit, I was actually going to the Belle Province next door for an Italian Poutine and a drink but they were closed or being renovated because of a change in ownership so I wound up coming here.  As mentioned, I prefer the burgers at Harvey's over the burgers at the other 3 fast food places near this place (less than a 5 minute walk) that I mentioned since the burgers at Harvey's didn't seem to be \"microwaved\". I can't comment on the burgers at La Belle Province next door or the Orange Julipe less than a 5 minute walk away since when I've gone to those places, I generally don't go there for a burger. Yes, I know that Wendy's doesn't microwave their burger patties but I prefer the charbroiled taste of a Harvey's burger over the other burgers at the fast food places that I've mentioned. Also, the toppings on the Harvey's burger (lettuce, tomatoes, mustard, relish, hot peppers, mayo, ketchup, & pickles) are more to my liking and it is easier to get a custom topped burger at Harvey's than at McDonald's & Burger King since Harvey's tops the burger in front of you.  Even the Harvey's veggieburger tastes good. I can hardly tell the difference between their veggieburger and their regular original burger (at least with the toppings that I pick for my burgers).  They accept credit cards, have a self serve soda machine which you can refill your drink before leaving, and they have free WiFi. You can also borrow a newspaper with a deposit which is returned to you when you return the newspaper. Parking lot is average size and it is less than a 1 minute walk from the Namur metro.  As fast food places go, I don't have anything negative to say except that Harvey's doesn't have as many promotions/coupons as their competition (McDonald's & Burger King) or at least I don't see that many coupons/promotions in the Publisac flyers that are delivered to my place. They also don't have the touchscreen ordering terminals that a lot of McDonald's has but this doesn't really bother me as long as service is relatively fast."}
{"text":"Great Poutine.  Easy in/out in small shopping center in Brossard."}
{"text":"Even the customers are nice! Gentleman before us in line offered his coupons for our meal. Staff were super nice despite encountering a problem with the register. Definitely one of the best burgers around. My boyfriends burger was taking long and then I saw the size of both patties and understood why! Very tasty and great quality considering the small jump in price compared to a trio at McDonald's or Burger King. Will deeefinitely be back. Especially with my coupons :)))"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers fries and onion rings. Quick and polite service. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Harvey's in a while but sometimes you just can't stop that burger craving. Harvey's has always been my favorite fast food burger joint and it still is. Always fresh ingredients and always a juicy burger.  I think they changed up their onion rings. The batter had a breaded crumble crust before but now its just a plain battered onion ring. I liked it the way it was before. Plus I didn't get any sauce like I did before for my onion rings."}
{"text":"Now this is a Harvey's that I like coming too.   I find this location's burgers are really fresh, it's always a joy when I come here to get my original burger, a poutine and a shake. Even though I gotta work out for 4 hours straight to work it off after:/ lol"}
{"text":"Came here craving an original Harvey's burger combo along with poutine and a Dr. Pepper. My fond memories of going to a Harvey's, was their fresh and tasty burgers.   When came here the other day, my burger was blah, poutine was blah as well. It just doesn't taste the same anymore, I remember their burgers being better.   Or maybe I came to the wrong Harvey's?  I don't know. Hopefully my next Harvey's burger will Be  better."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon and was craving for a good ole' Canadian Harvey's Cheeseburger.  This location was actually my Harvey's Restaurant when I was a tiny tot living in Mississauga.  A lot of good memories of my childhood were here.  We order a hamburger combo with onion rings and iced tea with cheeseburger on the side.  When ordering the cashier's attention was on other customers who already ordered, maybe looking at the line.  So when we were talking to her, she had to ask twice what we were saying.  We noticed that the shredded lettuce and diced onion toppings changed!  Now the lettuce is a full, green leaf and the onions are red, cut circular onions instead.  What was Cara Foods thinking?  They wanted to look more like a restaurant burger than fast food?  We want the shredded lettuce and the diced onions that look like they're from a hot dog stand!  Got to our seats and unfortunately, the buger was more than charbroiled, it was kinda burnt.  Regardless if it was still juicy, it was not a tremendous Harvey's burger.  Hopefully another location does it better."}
{"text":"The cashier was nice but the service was slow. There was only one lady ahead of us, we waited like  10 minutes to get served. After we ordered, it took 15 minutes to make us 2 bowls. SUPER STINGY ON THE LETTUCE, BACON, AND CHEESE (i paid extra for). The counter was kinda messy and lacking fresh ingredients. The girl put little ripped pieces of cucumbers instead of getting some new ones. Ordered a large oreo shake, and was given a small. Honestly too frustrated to complain so I didnt bother. Never coming back to this location again, the HWY27 & Finch location is who you guys should be mirroring."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and I received my meal in a timely manner. I've never been to this particular location. Appears to be recently renovated. It is clean and bright with ample seating. It was another poutine day for me!! It's not the best poutine I've had but since it's been a while l, I thought I'd check it out again. It was ok! Happy lunch yelpers (:"}
{"text":"Have you ever met employees from a fast food place who enjoy their jobs? Go to this Harvey's and you will see what I'm talking about.  EMPLOYEES Smiles, laughs, and genuine suggestions...that's what you get when you go to this Harvey's.  These guys are so sweet that I would go back just to see them.  FOOD The fries are so much better than than 10 years ago. They are a bit crunchy with a soft inside. Yum!  My burger was ok.   PARKING Free! but it's very small and it's very difficult to get out the lot during rush hour b/c it faces gerrard.  MENU Harvey's seems to have streamlined their menu. There are a signficantly less number of options and I think that was a fantastic idea. Simple is good.  LIGHTING It seems to be brighter inside. Before they had those ugly dark menus on the wall. Now, they've changed them to some simple, light coloured menus.  It makes the place a lot friendlier."}
{"text":"I've been in this place twice since it opened. While the burger itself is good, service has not both times I've been there.  The first time they left out part of my order, even though I was the only customer there and paid for it already. Thankfully I live close to the place and was able to drive there immediately upon finding out.   The second time they took a long time to finish my order, and from looking at the kitchen it appeared he burned my burger the first time. While I appreciate the honesty (hence why I didn't give it 2 stars), it was still an inconvenience for me as I waited about 10 minutes for the full order to come out (again being the only person there).  I love Harvey's and their burgers, but in terms of this place I generally don't visit unless I happen to be nearby (which unfortunately is quite often)."}
{"text":"One of the better Harvey's in the area, they're reasonable fast and make pretty good burgers. Never a hassle with their frequent coupons that I get from the mail. Also has Swiss Chalet chicken if you're craving that."}
{"text":"Me and my brother had their special combo for 4.99 each. The girl who took our orders were very friendly and with big smiles on her face. A combo for only 4.99 each is hard to find nowadays.  excellent deal..."}
{"text":"Never seen a waiter named Tom, great meals prices won't break you. Girls that work there are the best. Best Rubens in town, burgers are fantastic. Cold beer good food what else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Pretty good Harvey's location.  Just used the drive thru and service was fast and friendly.  Order was correct too."}
{"text":"Average Harvey's with consistently good service.  Drive through is a pretty bad design because of the layout of the plaza."}
{"text":"This place is SO much better than the McDonald's down the street.  Just saying... it doesn't look like as much fun from the outside but the interior has been renovated more recently.  They're serving Swiss Chalet as well which is always an extra gold star in my book.  This place is great for kids - they don't have much you can feed a 1 year old, but their chicken salad had just the right number of pieces to keep even the littlest hungry monster happy.  More fun facts? They have a drive through.  I've used it.  Their staff is unbelievable.  I drove off without one of my bags.  A lady ran out the entrance and chased my car before I could get very far without it.  This IS service.  The staff are wonderful and friendly - cheerful.  That also says something when it's a fast food chain.    p.s. Harveys, you need more places to tie up the dog.  We walked here and I had to tie her to the Bell phone booth outside.  Amazed to find a bell phone booth... :)"}
{"text":"My aunt just recently gave me a coupon book for Xmas with complimentary coupons and two for one specials.  I took advantage of it today and decided to eat at Harvey's.    Now I don't usually eat at fast food joints but I thought what the heck, I should at least try it out.  The place was very clean and the staff had the line up well orchestrated.  There is an option of Argus beef but I went with a basic original burger.  What I liked the most about Harvey's is that you have the option of what you want to put on your burger, tomatoes, lettuce, relish, mustard, mayo, chilli or pickles.  Everything is well prepared and all ingredients are very fresh.     The burger for a fast food burger was actually pretty good.  It was large and I think and with the condiments made for a great lunch.    Staff at this location is very friendly and extremely organised.  It was a nice change for me and prices are typically under 5 dollars."}
{"text":"This is a cramped location that hustles you through.  Personally I like to take my time a little, but that's just not the way it's done here.  The problem is, it's really a hurry up and wait situation.  Because their cash line has such a quick throughput, but the grill still takes time to cook your food, you're rushed only to stand around and wait for ages as your food is made.  Slowing everything down a little could ease out the entire experience."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best quick serve burgers in Canada. A tradition that goes back since 1959.  A Canadian classic.   Location is clean and service is good.  Made fresh  And the way I want it every time.  No compromises.   Happy to see the Original is on sale this week.  2 for $6."}
{"text":"I love Harvey's. Simply on of the best fast food burgers on the market.  Always done right and we'll priced.  I came by to try the Guacamole now offered at no extra charge.  What a great offering. No other fast food franchise offers free guacamole.  This place is very clean the service is awesome and my lunch got to be quick and hot. Thanks Harvey's"}
{"text":"Food here is on par with most Harvey's locations. However,  staff is not that well-trained.  I wasn't explained the new rewards program with Scene Cineplex & then I was refused to collect the points after the purchase."}
{"text":"Harvey's in general is pretty average.   Their burgers are okkk, but they are very generous with their toppings   They are one of the few places that offer hotdogs alongside their typical burgers."}
{"text":"So accommodating and helpful. Love the staff and food options available. I will definitely be going back. I'm 100%vegan and have weird suggestions and orders and they never let me down here!"}
{"text":"Alright so I went here once, there were just making a fresh batch of fries as my burger was ready so they served the burger and said they'd let me know when the fries were ready. As I sat there and ate my burger one of the employees came around and actually brought me my fries.  This is the first time in my life that something like that has happened for me at a fast food joint, so i felt they deserved a good review for the service."}
{"text":"I typically visit Harvey's often because they have a great veggie burger.  Today I went to get the Family meal deal which comes with 2 adult meals and 2 kids meals.  Since there is no kids vegetarian burger to accommodate my vegetarian kids, I made what I thought was a very reasonable request to give each child half an adult veggie burger in their kids meals.  They would not accommodate this request.  I won't be returning to Harvey's until they can accommodate my vegetarian kids."}
{"text":"This Harvey's is located in Markville Mall food court. Every time I have been here the staff are friendly and helpful. I also did not have to wait too long for the food. Since it is in a mall food court it can be busy during lunch or dinner time especially weekends. Another inconvenience is the fact they follow mall hours."}
{"text":"I am afraid they lost money on me (lol).  I do not eat burgers often, but dropped in for a veggie burger with my friend who was craving a burger. Everyone knows Harvey's is famous for the custom toppings, but it seems they have (recently?) added corn and guacamole to their options. Gone is the alfalfa.  I had a burger and it was soft and tasty. It had a good texture to it and I asked for double pickles and extra tomatoes and they were completely fine with it. The burger became hefty and extra tasty. Nice job, guys. The premises were clean and all the toppings were on display and available. This plaza is not bad parking-wise either.  One note if you want to go: do not go on a Wednesday night. The small restaurant was packed with schoolchildren. I asked the cashier and it is apparently a group from a religious school that drops in every Wednesday night. As with any group of teens and pre-teens they are not well-behaved and also there is nowhere to sit. Enjoy the Harvey's Burger at home or drop in some other time."}
{"text":"A-OK for sure. They have the most delicious chain burgers and with their perpetual on line coupons the price is also right. Theya dvertise some astronomical number of garnishes, which sounds crazy but regardless their famous toppings are always a hit. Double hot peppers yes please. Hint: if two burgers is too much try a burger and a junior burger for the perfect portion. This location also sells Swiss Chalet"}
{"text":"Tip:  You can replace fries with onion rings for FREE in a combo!  Came here 'cause I had coupons and didn't feel like cooking on a sweltering Summer's night.  It must have been about a decade since my last visit as nothing really draws me to fast food joints unless it's an a) insatiable craving (period monster) or b)  COUPONS!  Anyway, I thought it was great that you could get onion rings instead of fries at no extra cost.  Place was clean, staff were pretty efficient - not as fast as McD's, AC was working, and all drinks at fountain machine worked.  Pretty standard stuff all 'round.  I adjust my expectations for the price point.  One thing that was lacking is that there is no spout for H20!  I thought this a bit odd.  Like I know I'm eating burger+fries, but I would like to balance that out with some ice water, thanks!    Food tasted fine for price.  Not overly salted which was nice.  Burger is topped to your liking with an array of sauces and the standards like chopped onions, lettuce, tomatoes, & pickles.  BONUS:  Place also had free Wifi.  :)"}
{"text":"My grandmother lives in St. Catherine's and when I reminisce to visits with her I always remember this place. Such an amazing burger with fries and gravy! It is like Fuddruckers in the states if I had to compare it with more of a subway feel. The condiments for the burger were fresh and the burger was chargrilled. I wish they had a Harvey's were I live!"}
{"text":"I love this Harvey's. I've been going here for years. The staff (though they've changed over the years) are polite. I love their regular burgers and their veggie burgers. I love all their burgers here actually. You can trade fries for onion rings for free (and why wouldn't you).  I really love that you can get pickles on the side, whole wheat buns, barbeque sauce, hot sauce, spicy mayo, etc. and completely customize your burger. So delicious. I could eat here every day. Nommmmmmmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Decently flavored burgers, have a nice smokey flavor. If you are in the mood for some plain legit poutine, this is the place!"}
{"text":"This Harvey's is really efficient, and clean. Or at least it has been on all the times that I have been there. The Harveys establishment pretty much caters to, the OCD. (WHICH I LOVE) and granted it is takeout food for the most part, so you know what you are expecting...  There is no Swiss Chalet attached, for anyone visiting from out of town, that might expect these two to be combined.   A few things: if you order the Poutine, then ask for \"extra gravy\" if you are a fan of gravy...because they do tend to be a little light on the gravy.   Also, ask for extra pickels on the side if you are a fan! they wrap them separately and they make a great snack later."}
{"text":"I've been to the new Harvey's in Liberty Village a few times and it's pretty good!   The food is solid - Harvey's burgers tend to be a slight step above McDonald's/Burger King. The fresh topping make the burgers stand out and the frings are a must.  More importantly, the new location looks nice, is clean and has a very friendly and attentive staff. Compared to the thinly-veiled contempt or general nincompoopery found in most local fast food staff, the people at this Harvey's are great!.  It's no Five Guys and not a gourmet burger shop by any means, but for chain-based fast food in this neighbourhood Harvey's is hard to beat."}
{"text":"Very friendly and funny service. Burgers tasted amazing. Random customer took my friends drink. Not that employees fault for what a customer did"}
{"text":"Had burgers, fries and onion rings with the family! Great fast food burgers on a budget! Stuffed cheeseburger is back!  Anthony at till gave exceptional service.  Double checked to make sure he heard my daughters order right. Made suggestions on what shake flavour to have, and asked if we wanted pies for 2.00! Very polite and friendly! Better than the last guy who served us a month ago"}
{"text":"I don't know what to say.  I don't know how to compare.  Most of all, I don't know what I ate.  I hardly review a fast food chain but here goes..  I don't know what Canadian angus beef would taste like to be qualified to make criticism but I'm pretty sure it's nothing close to what I had. So I hear Harvey's is the \"Burger King\" of Canada, even though there's a bunch of BKs lying around. And of course, I couldn't spend my last night in Toronto without trying some Canadian fast food.   Harvey's is actually like the Subway of burgers--you get to build your burger as much as you'd like with toppings. I got the Canadian Angus and topped it with lettuce, tomatoes, pickle and mayo and ketchup. I was disappointed that the bun wasn't toasted but the toppings were all good and the burger wasn't bad. The meat tasted and looked like plastic but that's fast food, right?   Probably won't order that burger again the next time I visit a Harvey's but I'm open to try different ones. Staff was kind!"}
{"text":"Not bad - anything they lack in food quality is compensated with very positive staff and above average customer service!"}
{"text":"#1 Hookers hang out on the corner. One girl had a breast hanging out of her dress, such a funny sight!  #2 My burger wasn't fit for dog food. It looked like a bunch of gray worms packed together, gross!"}
{"text":"Harvey's is a favorite among the locals in the West Mifflin, Duquesne and Dravosburg community.  It's a spacious bar/restaurant that serves up good quality food for a bargain price, strong drinks and it usually has one or two craft beers on tap. Weekends the place gets packed with a DJ on Friday nights and bands on Saturday nights.   I've been coming to Harvey's for years now and I've never had a bad meal, bad service or a bad time. There's always a few dinner specials' on the board and tonight I got the spaghetti and meat sauce with garlic bread and a side salad.  It was delicious; but the portion was enough for two and I just couldn't finish it.   If you're in the area and looking for a bite and beer that won't bust your budget, you could do a lot worse than Harvey's. Just a word of caution though, smoking is permitted so if that's an issue, you might want to pass."}
{"text":"Harvey's is a decent place to get something to eat.  I went here for dinner on my first night in Toronto.  I was looking for something quick.  I got a chicken sandwhich with fries and it hit the spot.  It is like your typical fast food joint.   Service is friendly and helpful.  I had gotten a nice warning that my food might be really hot so to give it a minute before eating."}
{"text":"This location is good. It was clean, friendly staff with good food. Much better than my last expericenc at the Dixion Road location"}
{"text":"I am disappointed with this Harvey's location. Been here three times. They staff are friendly. I find the quality of the food not to be as good as other locations. My big \"beef\" is the cleanliness of this place. every time we have been here almost all the empty tables were dirty and garbage was all over the floor. Will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Average Harveys food. Pretty big restaurant. Apparently this is where they shoot Harveys commercials. Tried the new Mesquite sauce. Nice bite but much too barbecue saucy for me."}
{"text":"Very fast and efficient service.  My food was ready before I filled up my drink.  The food is better than the rest of the fast food burger chain restaurants we have in Canada.  The options in terms of the stuff you can put on your sandwich are nice (as is the option of a multigrain bun). I really like this location.  This is a well-run company and I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at a Harvey's."}
{"text":"I've experienced such great service at this Harvey's, that it makes me a little surprised, to be honest. Usually fast food employees seem like they'd rather be anywhere else, and while I can get that - you also aren't supposed to show it. I've always had smiling and helpful people taking my order and it's refreshing. Anyway, they have a good crew, amazing little donuts that I didn't know even existed and are SO good, and frequent coupon deals that make Harvey's a great option in an area surrounded by McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Pizza, etc. in the immediate vicinity. Other than that, it's your basic Harvey's. Great burgers, and they also have onion rings! :)"}
{"text":"I love Harvey's burgers.  This franchise precooks them, keeps them in a warmer drawer and then serves them up.  I'm expecting them to put one on the grill when I order and expect to wait for it. How long was your burger in the drawer? I asked for a fresh  burger and they said they were. I saw the grill person pull mine out a drawer just below the bun toaster while blocking the view from the front.  I insisted on a fresh one and they eventually did make a fresh burger for me.   You can see the grill from the counter and I saw them cook batches and store them for future usage.   There was no one in the lineup and he had 10-15 burgers on the grill which went to the side after they were done. How fresh or safe is that? When I got my burger it was fresh and tasted great.   Is this the new Harvey's standard or just a rogue franchisee?"}
{"text":"In sum Harvey's is a Canadian hotdog and burger fast food chain, that allows you to dress your order as you wish (from the toppings behind the glass counter). The main reason I am writing this review is to tell you about the unique decor at this particular location. They have really made it look and feel different that the others, with sports memorabilia and even has a faux brick wall from my recollection. They have a very tasty veggie burger and I always ask for extra pickles on everything I get there (they have great sliced pickles). I also noticed they now have a bunch of new sauces in squirt bottles a la Subway. It was a stormy night, but was worth it for their always tasty onion rings. The staff is also of note at this location, there seem to be a lot of them...young and spirited. Especially, worth a trip when its coupon time. Solo meals for 4.99 and great family deals offer fair savings. Darn, it's dinner time, now I'm hankering for some."}
{"text":"I walked in here with my husband and the first thing I asked the cashier lady if she has gluten free buns or lettuce wraps and she said only multigrain or white. She looked like she didn't understand me and my husband asked her the same question and she gave him an attitude. Another thing I noticed was that the girl at the grill was using her BARE HANDS to move the burgers aside and NO GLOVES. In addition to, the guy who was serving us was was flirting with the grill girl and was really SLOW with our order. Also, why were our onion rings so thin? Does it kill a person to add thicker onions. The cleanliness of this place was filthy, no one cleans this place. Also the trash bins were overflowing! Honestly not worth the time and money to go here for a date."}
{"text":"Food great at Harvey's restaurants in general. But This particular one i don't go to after seeing this.  Its probably a huge health hazard.   The bread gets delivered  stacked to the back very early in the mornings and sits there until someone opens store and brings it in   One summer I watched as birds landed and poked through the plastic eating the bread.  I'm sure this is a health hazard for sure. Maybe not.  Just saying. I called and told them but have seen it happen since every time the bread stacked in the back   Good luck !"}
{"text":"I hadnt had harveys in a long time. Like maybe a decade. I got some coupons in the mail and then remembered why I hadnt come to Harveys in so long.   Starting with the owner that never smiles and looks like he hates his life... and ending with the Burger that just wasnt very good... I'll pass on Harveys."}
{"text":"I am rating this Harvey's 3.5 stars.  I have been to this Harvey's a handful of times. It is on the northeast corner of Highway 27 and Finch. This location is on my way home from work.  This restaurant has a drive-thru. When it comes to Harvey's, I prefer going into the restaurant to place my order. I like selecting what toppings and condiments I want on my food. Doing this task at the drive-thru doesn't cut it.  This Harvey's is in a plaza. There is ample parking. I typically am here to visit Starbucks. Last week, I was doing just that and parked my car to fetch an item from my car's trunk. I noticed that I had free wifi from Harvey's. I actually connected to its guest wifi fine.  I looked at what offers were available at Harvey's on my phone. I was excited when I saw key lime mini donuts. OMG! I normally don't jump for joy over donuts (I worked rotating shifts years ago and that's all we ate). However, I love anything with lime. These donuts are available for a limited time.  I went through the drive-thru. You have the option of ordering four or eight mini donuts. I went with four, just in case I didn't like them. The woman handling my order was friendly and cheerful. Four donuts are just over $2 after taxes.  The donuts are hot and have key lime icing. So good! The tartness is perfect. I am glad that I ordered four. I would have completely lost my mind eating eight yummy mini donuts.  In the past, I have ordered an angus burger (yum) and the fish (disgustingly heavy with oil) at this location. I like that you can order onion rings or a small salad instead of fresh fries. The onion rings are done right here.  I like this place. It's clean inside with lots of windows.  (108)"}
{"text":"I stopped at this Harvey's for lunch. I was on my way to see a friend in Mississauga and cut through Brampton.   This restaurant is pretty new. It has a cheerful feel to it when you walk in.   The cashier seemed new. I ordered a pizza burger. I didn't realize that she just gave me a regular burger combo. That's okay. It is typically my regular order!    The burger was good. I like relish and there was a decent amount. I had hoped to get guacamole, but the store had run out.   The restaurant is clean. There is plenty of parking. I'd drop by here again if I'm in the vicinity.   (216)"}
{"text":"Best Harvey's in GTA!  This location has been the best one of all GTA, they are consistent in delivering quality every visit whether they're slammed or just a short wait.   I always get the same thing, veggie burger on multi grain bun, original budget combo and chicken tenders for my little guy. Chicken tenders is hard to get right, under cooked or over cooked but this place nails it every time and my kid will eat all his dinner.   Burgers are layered evenly, which is key to building a topping tower here. They know how to place tomato and pickles which is not a training mastered at some other locations which confuses me to no end.  The lines up on Friday nights seem to confirm how good this place is leaving the McD right next door sparse. Staff all seem well trained and very friendly, no teenage drama here.  If you're craving a Harvey's experience, they do it right here!"}
{"text":"Came here to get a delicious Oreo milkshake, only to be told that the milkshake machine was closed. I now sit here milkshake-less and broken hearted. Why would any self respecting establishment close their milkshake machine over an hour before they even close?  I am disgusted and hangry. Unacceptable. I will be going elsewhere for my milkshakes from now on."}
{"text":"The burger is by far fresher and more real tasting than any other fast food restaurant. Quite delicious in fact, I wish I had got 2 burgers instead of fries.   My concern was in wait time as it seemed to take way too long to get burgers. Though, this isn't McDonald's,  so I'm willing to wait.   But why not gloves for cooks? I just prefer food handlers to be wearing gloves  I don't think that's unfair."}
{"text":"Let me be clear: if you told me I had to have a Harvey's burger every single day for lunch, that would be OK by me, I love them that much. I wouldn't have to have bacon on it although that's always nice, I wouldn't have to have fries although I like Harvey's fries, and I wouldn't have to have gravy to dip the fries into, though that's always nice too! My daughter prefers Harvey's poutine, but I particularly like the crispiness of Harvey's french fries and I don't want that excellent taste drowned.   I have seen some comments from Harvey's customers that they wish Harvey's had kept their lettuce the old way as opposed to shredded but personally I think it tastes better shredded. What else do I like? I love the variety of toppings and sauces offered, better I would argue than most fast food chains. It's such a variety that I do change up how I top that sizzling unmistakable perfectly charbroiled Harvey's burger. 3 dill pickles (and they must be dill, dammit, I despise sweet pickles and relish on a burger or hot dog), plus some red onions is always on my cheeseburger or cheese bacon burger.   I usually have at least 4 crunchy fresh cucumber slices, and when I have those, I really don't need any lettuce. Then I may add black olives with or without jalapeño peppers or pickled hot peppers. If they had mushrooms, I'd have those too (for your suggestion box, Cara Operations?), but I'm quite happy with the toppings offered.   My daughter was over the moon with joy when she saw guacamole had been added to the toppings choices recently, so on this occasion I tried it, and it was pretty good. As my daughter pointed out, the avocado in guacamole is a healthy choice for us both. (Small halo magically materializes over my head at this point. A hedonistic gourmand like me needs all the halos she can get LOL!)   The sauces are all the usual ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise and relish, plus Dijon mustard, which I like, hot sauce, which I also like, tzaziki which I love, and the Louisiana moderately spicy sauce which I also love. It's really an embarrassment of riches.    I was as thrilled when Harvey's introduced warm lime spiced mini doughnuts to the dessert menu as my daughter had been about the new guacamole topping. The trouble is, it is SO hard to share them; they are TOO good. I also like it that Harvey's offers slushies in different flavours as an alternative to soft drinks or shakes. I can't resist a slushie, especially in hot weather.  This Queensway Harvey's isn't my usual Harvey's location, my nearest one is on the airport strip on Dixon Road, which has excellent staff, as does the Queensway location, but the Queensway has nicer scenery from the windows onto Queensway and for some reason, a more relaxed ambience with more young families and elderly patrons enjoying the food. The airport strip location tends to attract workmen taking a quick lunch break. It's a different atmosphere. I have been here twice and would happily drop by this Harvey's again."}
{"text":"IMHO the best charbroiled burger chain in Canada, bar none, is Harvey's. None of the big U.S. burger chains can match it. Here you can REALLY have it your way with fresh quality toppings, including cheddar & bacon. TIP: Like the Harvey's Facebook Page & they'll email you coupons! You don't have to print em, just show them on your smartphone to the cashier. This location is right on the Airport strip, handy to Pearson Airport. The staff are pleasant friendly efficient and serve you quickly. Regardless of the lineup, you'll never wait long to be served!"}
{"text":"I 100% agree with the previous reviewer about the vibe. It isn't the most \"classy\" Harvey's location. I have eaten there a few times but will only be taking out in the future due to this.   On the other hand, I've had a pretty good experience with the staff. I found them to be pretty friendly and helpful. Of all the veggie burgers that I've tried at other fast food restaurants, I have to say, Harvey's is the best. Quite honestly, I recently had a veggie burger at the restaurant \"LOV\" (which cost 4 times the price) and found the Harvey's burger to be better. The onion rings are always hot and crispy. The ingredients for the burgers always look fresh and they are generous with the portion. You can't expect an upscale-dining experience but I think Harvey's is superior to other fast-food places in the area.  Big upside for Harvey's in general, they have an excellent discount for CAA members. Ask an employee about it next time you go."}
{"text":"This Harvey's is a standalone franchise whereas it is not attached to a Swiss Chalet. It would be nice if it had a drive-thru so I wouldn't have to bring in my screaming child.  The staff at this location are very nice and quick. I ended up ordering the pulled pork burger which was surprisingly good.  The location gets a little busy around the lunch hour as it appears some of the local workers come here for a quick bite.  The Peaks Frean outlet is just around the corner which may make for an inexpensive dessert if you're still hungry."}
{"text":"Love coming here always a good buy on any combo will continue coming here till the place close down."}
{"text":"Got the angus burger combo with a Nutella smoothie. Haven't been to Harvey's in years but their food is always of higher quality. I just noticed the size of fries has become much smaller than I remember. The Nutella smoothie was thick but very good."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff.  They make your hamburger a beautiful thing! Fast and friendly.  Bathroom was tidy."}
{"text":"Big fan of Harvey's. Usually order an Angus with cheese. You pick your own toppings so if it doesn't go right it's your own fault. I usually have lettuce, tomato, cucumber, pickle, guac, and Harvey sauce. Great every time."}
{"text":"Oh Harveys your food is good,   love the coupons,  meal deal $4.99 :),   the 10 minutes wait to be served when there is no line up was odd, with only one person behind the counter knows how to use the cash register and they cannot be found.  once cashed out,  service was fast,  food was fresh, fries were hot and pickles on the side,  yum yum, and free fountain drink refills as always quench your thirst"}
{"text":"Never have I seen a fast food place who takes their time to ensure that their customers are satisfied. The staff is very nice and their food is outstatnding. Parking is good. Their washrooms are clean. Overall 4 5/5"}
{"text":"Samedi 29 juin 2013  Quelle catastrophe !!! Le rêve était trop beau pour être vrai. Harvey's du Dix30 n'est même pas capable de gérer une période importante d'activité. 100 % et oui, la totalité des commandes est erronée avec des manques à différents niveaux, des clients insatisfaits et fâchés de ne pas recevoir leur commande du premier coup. Surprenant pour un restaurant fastfood bien connu et supposé être bien organisé. On ne vous demande pas si la garniture est correcte. Les préposés doivent sans cesse rembourser ou échanger les commandes. Quel gâchis !!!  Saturday june 29th 2013  What a catastrophe !!! The dream was too good to be true. Harvey's at Dix30 isn't able to manage an increase in orders. 100 % YES !!! 100 % of all the orders are mostly wrong or incomplete on many levels. Unsatisfied and mad clients cannot receive their rightful orders. It's surprising to see how weak is organized the well known fastfood joint. They don't ask you how is your garnish or if it's satisfayingly fulfilled. All the staff is on emergency mode to try to recover the correct order and the correct parts of the order. What a loss of good time !!!"}
{"text":"Je viens chez Harvey's depuis que je suis petit. Spécialement celui au coin de Lapinière et Taschereau à Brossard. C'est le premier de l'endroit, historiquement. On ne se trompe jamais ! Essayez tout sur le menu !"}
{"text":"Bahaha I can't believe I am writing a fast food joint review since I don't go fast food often. I was so hungry today from outing all day an forgot to eat like literally forgot to . As we drove thru liberty I had craving n my bf literally turned car around as I last min yelled out Harvey's before he turning to King street . It was worth the effort . I had the best fast food at all time!  They have this NEW DELICIOUS fish burger/sandwich that is on test menu/promo for $4.99! Omg it was the MOST delicious fish burger ever! I wasn't sure about it n asked the staff if she had tried. Her response was like \"omg it's so yum\" with(the word it's amazing written on her face)so that decided for me. They made fresh fish sandwich for me n omg the fish was NOT as small as I expected like u get from McDonals! The corners of square fish was sticking out of the actual bun, that's how big they were. it's literally huge piece of thick fish that is lightly breaded fried golden outside , juicy and soft and flaky inside. It's white fish not fishy all. Something u will have to pay $17 for a quality fish sandwich at restaurant . Simple tarta sauce, lattes tomato and onion. It was soooo soo soo yum. The combo came with option of half onion ring n half fries(awesome ) ! Onion ring were fluffy n so delicious! I ordered the apple pie! 2 for $2. Omg it was soo delicious! The pasty was flaky n fresh the inside Apple was not sour like McDonalds.   I am writing this n feeling mouth watering! I ate everything . Surprisingly I normally have small appetite n I feel full very fast, but it was much better than any fast food I have had last while! I did however need to have 2tb spoon of Pepto Bismo as soon as i got home due to binging.  I don't usually eat fast or oily food so I have difficulty digesting it but I got so excited anyway .  My bf was trying tempt me to eat n offered to buy more food like poutine n more pies . I was Able to stop tho so I prevented myself from going over the board! They have $5.99 chicken poutine! $5.79 chilly poutine! .... So many yummy treats! And it's not expansive ! I can't wait to try next!   The staff are very friendly the place is very clean and inviting.  I will be planning next visit soon. :):)"}
{"text":"On my two recent visits here I have had the opportunity to try both the Harvey's and Swiss Chalet sides of the restaurant. Things were good and pretty much on par for what you would expect. The food was prepared quickly and was delicious. The dining area was clean and I like the fact that they provide different receptacles for your trash so that things can be recycled instead of just tossed in the garbage."}
{"text":"I was in the area here and wanted a quick lunch that was different than the usual fast food options. The line in the drive-thru wasn't too long so I stopped in here. They were pushing their new pulled pork sandwiches, but I spotted a poster for a stuffed burger which looked tasty.  I like that Harvey's promotes having a burger made your way, but if you're not familiar with the toppings they offer, the drive-thru may not be the best option.  The burger was good, though the cheese they put into the middle just seemed like a folded up cheese slice or two. There wasn't anything overly special about the burger though I did like that it was a 6oz patty."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 stars only because of the supreme lack of cleanliness. I've been coming to this location for 20+ years and the retro feel of this location is very nice in addition to the food, which is good. However, it has gotten to a point where the restaurant is very dirty from inside on most days. The floors are never clean, neither are the tables. The washrooms are unspeakably dirty. I really wish they would maintain the cleanliness of this location. Everything else is great."}
{"text":"This location made Harvey's my favourite fast food burger chain. Why this place in particular? Staff here are friendly and the burgers here are always made to perfection. Being close to the highway as well as city centre, this location is not surprisingly busy all day.  Like many other Harvey's, burgers are made to order with fresh ingredients and the patties are grilled. What you get is a pretty large, juicy burger that's well seasoned. Fries and onion rings here are crispy as they're always being freshly made. In my opinion, the amount and quality of food for the price you pay exceeds what you would get from other chains (i.e. A&W, Wendy's, Five Guys).   They've recently renovated the dining area which gives this location a typical look that resembles a casual or bar-type burger restaurant."}
{"text":"Aside from having sushi attack, I have a lot of 'Harvey's\" attack lately!  I know this is NO gourmet but Harvey's burger really hit the spot... fast, reasonable priced and never disappointed!  Service here is fast and friendly.  You will see me hop by and stuff my face often..."}
{"text":"When it is cold and snowy outside and the BBQ season is over, I always have this Harvey's Burger Attack.  Their burgers are one of my favourite comfort food.   I used to go to the location at McCowan and Hwy 7 but with Congee Queen and several other restaurants opened up at that plaza, parking is just a nightmare.....  Thankful, this location opened up in my neighbourhood and now is my Go To location.   The service always good and polite. And I just that fresh off the grill taste..  This location used to be a CIBC, but I am glad that now is a Harvey's!!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this Harvey's location since the staff here is all so friendly and nice but I think it was a bad move for corporate to make this location with a Drive Thru.  The restaurant already is smaller than the one I used to go to. There is only 1 cook with a small grilling area. She had to manage everything including the grill and the fryer. When the place is busy, the quality of the food does suffer. My onion ring was not cooked through, still doughy. My  toasted bun was burnt (black on one side). I waited forever for the food.....  And add to that, there are Drive Thru customers....  I went to the front and shown her my burnt bun and it was replaced. But this is really the first time I had that issue for all these years I had been eating at Harvey's.  I don't think I would be coming back for my burger at this location."}
{"text":"Yes, I realize I'm reviewing a Harvey's, but it is in a very busy part of the city so I feel it is justified.  This location of Harvey's, a Canadian burger joint, is probably one of the busiest ones in the country. Basically Union Station is Canada's equivalent of New York's Grand Central, with a million different commuter and traveller vehicles and trains coming in and out every hour of every day.  So you'd think this Harvey's would have mastered the art of speed. I mean, they are already a fast food place, and they are busy ALLLLL the time. Plus they are one of the few choices in the Union Station food area with seating. This is key.  All the people who order their burgers and fries, no problems for you. Things will move along quite quickly and you can be in and out in minutes, happily eating your angus burger and onion rings.  But, if you have children with you on said trip, and they have very specific demands, like chicken strips and poutine...well, you're outta luck. You will have to wait in the crowded line for 10 minutes. FOR FAST FOOD.  Harvey's is decent for fast food, and it's especially good if you're on the go travelling or commuting, but stick to burgers at this location if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Went here instead of some close by joints because it had seating.  No air-conditioning , and the temperature on the thermostat read 28 degrees!"}
{"text":"Oh Harvey's how do I love thee, let me count the ways..... This Harvey's location is pretty much never busy and the service is always fast and friendly. It is clean and roomy, I don't think I've ever been in their washrooms though."}
{"text":"Service is slow making the food but to try to make up for it, person at cash register interups you to finish your order and misses details. Then I was told by person garnishing that I did not tell them the order correctly. Definately not the best Harveys in town. I will go down further South on Yonge near 16th to the Harveys they are much better."}
{"text":"This Harvey's also offers Swiss Chalet items and it is pretty standard, they serve burgers that are good, and the place is generally pretty clean  Food: The food is standard Harvey's food that you'll find anywhere. Nothing too special - however, I found that they were much more generous with their toppings than other Harvey's I've been to, and as long as you ask nicely, they're willing to give you a little extra. The fries were a bit cold when I got them, and not super crispy, but the onion rings they had were good. Food gets a standard 7.5/10.  Atmosphere: It is a nice clean Harvey's, there were quite a few families when I went in on a cold Tuesday evening. The place, when I first walked in was fairly clean, but by the time I left, it was kind of a mess, it looked like no one was washing down the tables or cleaning up the floors. They have nice booth seats for people to sit in, so it is a nice alternative to the Burger's Priest across from the street.  Service: The employee behind the cash was nice enough, didn't give any exempliary service, but was patient with some of the other customers who were a bit slower or still deciding. The person giving out burger toppings didn't seem very amused and didn't seem like they wanted to talk much, but gave what I asked."}
{"text":"Burger was too salty and the fries were burned, yet soggy. This location sucks... didnt even give me napkins when I went in drive though as well as in store, both times, no napkins. Better off getting a box of burgers for same price and making them yourself, otherwise there is a burgerK close by and they are great!"}
{"text":"Dreadful male cashier. Stopped in yesterday for lunch. A male cashier came from the back to open another cash register to assist a female cashier already working. Unfortunately, I got him.  He took my order, no issues. He then asked if I wanted ice in my drink, to which I responded \"yes\".  i guess he had already decided for me as my drink came with no ice (which wasn't discovered until after I had seated myself). He then he asked me if it was \"for here or to go\", then placed a \"to go\" bag on the counter although I said it was \"for here\". When I asked a female cashier for a tray (there was a large stack of them near her), she politely got me one. I get everyone has a bad day and mistakes happen, but when you ask a customer a question regarding their order, you should be able to ensure you get it right..if not..what's the point of asking. Food was what to be expected.  Dining area was spotless, as was the restroom."}
{"text":"This place has the best veggie burger topped with all my vegan options I can ask for, I so wish they had this in the states and the staff was professional and the facility was clean. Can't complain"}
{"text":"Customer service is by far the biggest issue here. Last time I went, they didn't have any tray liners, were rationing napkins, and I had to ask for a fork for my bowl (am I supposed to eat it with my hands?!) and they placed it on the bare tray so I asked for another which pissed off the person I assume was the manager.  They aren't fast either."}
{"text":"Harvey's is that old place your parents took you for that \"Flame Broiled\" burger instead of fried, today, choices have definitely improved when tossing that round puck on the grill.   Overall, I have no idea why I go back here, must be nostalgia....this time it was the coupons I found on Flipp that lured me in for a cheap meal. The taste of the burgers don't taste like beef, honestly, I have no idea what's in them, but, I get onion powder with pepper and cardboard. Although, I like the fries and onion rings and I always eat them with a small serving of mayo to dip them into.  I usually order the double burger and today was no exception. What I do like about this location is that it is clean and they don't over cook the burger until its the consistency of a hockey puck. I do find Harvey's locations in general overcook their patties and dry everything out. Kudo's to these guys in Bolton for knowing how to cook the beef (I think that might be an ingredient, but, I could be wrong?). The Rings were good as expected and had a fountain Dr. Pepper, dunno why, just wanted to try something different, not even going to comment on a fountain pop.  Overall, if you like Harvey's burgers, you'll find this location does a good job at cooking it up...as far as the burgers go, pretty standard across the board, same flavors no matter where you go."}
{"text":"Terribly disorganized and poorly trained staff. Huge posters advertising their 3 cheese bacon angus burger, but it took 3 times to get it right, and only half a piece of bacon hiding under the patty, pathetic! They've lost my business, too bad because this location was a go to for me!"}
{"text":"This review is for Harvey's in general, not this particular location. I LOVE Harvey's veggie burger - it's absolutely delicious! It's got a solid and convincing \"meaty\" taste and it's so substantial that you can barely finish the portion. Highly recommended if you're vegetarian and find yourself in fast food land with nothing to eat!"}
{"text":"Harvey's was never my favourite burger spot but they have improved over the past decade.  This location is bright and updated, great service and the food was good.  The poutine was yummy and the customizable burgers is a great touch."}
{"text":"County our change! The woman at the counter has a hard time taking the order. Then has an even harder time counting change back. Come on the machine tells you how much to give back. Count it back. Should not be that hard.  Food was on the expensive side for fast food but was hoping the service would make up for it. The service didn't deserve one start. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favourite places to chill in Union Station. The GO concourse downstairs may be hoppin', but the seating area here could be just about dead. The seating area itself is deceptive - it doesn't look huge from the station proper, until you turn the corner. Then... yikes.  The TV is usually tuned to the Jays or Leafs game, which is nice - otherwise, pretty much whatever the staff wants to watch. Getting to watch Mortal Kombat while waiting for the train was very welcome.  Food is, as per Harveys usual, a lot better than the McDonald's downstairs. Having said that, the speed is a good deal slower, and the price a bit higher. Also, Pepsi rather than Coke - not my favourite.  All in all, I can't say I've ever had a problem here. If time allows, it's a nice upgrade from what's available on the GO concourse - and, as I mentioned before, often a lot quieter."}
{"text":"This has become a favourite for lunch at the office - at least, when McDonald's Monopoly isn't on. It's a recently renovated location, so the fixtures are all new and the place is very clean. I've found the weekday crew to be very good - fast, efficient and gets the orders right. Exactly what you're hoping for with fast food. The quality is what you'd expect from Harveys - better than McDonald's, not as good as Licks.  When I've gone in on the weekend, though, it's a slightly different story - longer wait times despite less of a crowd, and having to repeat myself a few times while ordering. The wait times may well be due to less order volume - that I get - but the repeating myself just means to me that you aren't paying attention. I don't come in often on weekends though, so not a huge issue for me.  One other gripe: there only seems to be one Interac machine for customers at the counter. When the crew from our office comes in, we all pay by debit, so this is an annoying bottleneck that should be easy to fix. Get on it, Harveys!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, service is fast, and the food is fresh. Wish they had more outlets but the wifi is decent at least.  Update: They have power outlets on the north side, but they are turned off. Lost a star for stinginess."}
{"text":"The old lady that works here is always grumpy. She never smiles!  Wifi is kinda slow, and no power outlets."}
{"text":"You caught me! After shopping at Staples right behind Harvey's I suddenly remembered Harvey's from the last time I was there at the age of 19 and suddenly I had a craving for a custom made hot dog.   From what I remember of the last time I ate there in 1994 it was really good. I once called Harvey's the Cadillac of Fast Food due to the customized features and experience.   Truthfully, it was kind of satisfying for a quick snack.   I am a gourmet hot dog aficionado and normally I visit certain gourmet vendors who specialize in that - yet the custom options were still pretty good and it tasted vastly better than any other fast food I can recall. It's been a few years since my last onion ring but these onion rings were ridiculously addictive... Yummy-tastic even.   The restaurant was spotless, the service was quick, and the staff were really friendly. And there was no blaring beepy high volume machines driving you insane like other fast food places. It was kind of peaceful and I took that time to make a long journal entry.   Well, what can I say... If I ever need a quick fix while rolling down 36th street I may have to stop in. Only a distant 'Maybe' though - as I am used to some pretty amazing home cooked food.  Thanks Harvey's  Sincerely, Shane"}
{"text":"Unprofessional unhygienic teens. Food is Alright. Wouldn't come back cause the teens turn me off. Management and owner should be embarrassed. Train your staff or have someone monitor and discipline. Kitchen staff off shift reaching over the counter from the customer side getting pickle slices with bare hands and shoving it into their mouth repeatedly, blocking customers and talking loudly. Really? No on site manager?"}
{"text":"Sigh. The food here is DELICIOUS!! Its usually always fresh... Occasionally the bun is stale but for the most part, it's great. The only problem at this place really is the NASTY washrooms!! If you are having a washroom emergency....go in the grass or anywhere else but here. It's always disgusting. It smells, rarely toilet paper, and always always filthy, plus the cracks between the stalls are huge. Very uncomfortable"}
{"text":"The service is amazing I've been there a couple of times. It's clean and I love the food!"}
{"text":"This is my to go place if I am running late and didn't manage to make a midnight snack for work. It's open on most days until 10:30 which is perfect. Most staff are teenagers which never look to thrilled to be there ( understandably ), but they are mostly friendly and professional.  As for the Burger I think it's the closest you would get to the home made burger taste. I personally find the Burgers a bit on the small side and usually need two to fill me up but at least they don't taste like sodium. The poutine is also really good at this place and again no overbearing sodium taste.  They also have a drive-thru at this location."}
{"text":"This location has been open since at least 1985 (when I came to the country). It hasn't changed and I'm not sure it's a good thing. Whenever my mom is visiting from Florida, she HAS to have some Harvey's. It's tradition. It's been awhile since i've been to this one and it will be awhile before I come back. There are cleaner one with better service out there!"}
{"text":"I've gotten burgers here several times out of convenience and it's clear to me that this place is pretty meh. The same lady who is responsible for cooking the patties the times I come does a mediocre job. It's always overcooked. I'm sorry for being harsh but the patty is like the soul of the burger. If it's bad, the whole burger is bad.   One time I told another girl I wanted relish as one of my toppings. She gave me so much, I had to tell her to take some off and even after, it was dripping all over the wrapping. They need to train their staff better. They also cheap out on giving you toppings especially tomatoes.   My recommendation? Go to another Harvey's."}
{"text":"Harvey's got breakfast!  Holy, I don't remember the last time I took a breakie break at Canada's grill house.  Must be two decades!  This place is probably the newest addition to the Orange and Black purveyor of marginal grilled meats.  The establishment is clean and well laid out.  Clean chairs, booths, pop machines, tables, and floors - nice to be brand spanking new eh?  I was on my way for a late morning meeting and I needed some sustenance.  Yeah...I know...I basically skipped the most important meal of the day.  I was going to make it up to myself with a local greasy spoon breakfast.  As I was zipping by, I saw the new Harvey's building.  I'm not a major Harvey's fan but I had to stop as a huge banner indicated Breakfast.  I felt nostalgic as Harvey's breakfast was one of the few meals I had with my Dad.  Had the Homestyle Breakfast.  Couple of Eggs, Sausage or Bacon, toast, home fries, and coffee.  $7 including taxes.  Feeling sorry for the nearby breakfast spots as this is undercutting their fare.  They also have a bunch of breakfast sandwiches where you can add toppings.  Nice!  The breakfast was well prepared.  Slices of tomato, cucumbers, and other veggies were offered with a couple of packets of jam.  I could have made the same at home but I got lazy today and I for one was happy to find the place.  3.5 Stars.  Cheers."}
{"text":"This location's service is just a tad ahead of the curve above every other Harvs location. You get your typical Harvey's experience here, except they write your name on the receipt and call your name to ask what you want on your burger. I then took a seat, and THANK GOODNESS this location had seats and tables next to an outlet. I've been to other locations ehere they are not. If you want more customers dining in, then it would be a wise choice to have a seat next to an outlet like this location? Anyway, while I was sitting I noticed an elderly couple walk in. The cashier let them sit down first and walked their orders to them! That's above and beyond service. The food was on par with every other Harvs location."}
{"text":"pretty standard place to come and get a burger for a good price, the restaurant is due for a bit of an upgrade, but holds a bit of a nostalgic feel to it. the staff are super friendly with faster then normal service. the parking lot has lots of spaces, but is a little bit odd at times with how the drive thru is configured.  otherwise I would put this location at a bit better then some of the other burger joints in the area.  the new fish burger is fantastic, I recommend it."}
