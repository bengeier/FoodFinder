{"text":"The four of us stopped here on our way back from Pittsburgh. I would agree with the commenter who said the eggs were delicious. The bacon was the best I've had in a very long while. That said, it took an inordinately long time for the waitress to come over. One of our orders was messed up and the Bloody Mary was so spicy, it was undrinkable. Those two problems were corrected immediately. A heads up that this is a few miles from the interstate. A good alternative to fast food, but it seems locals are treated more warmly than outsiders here."}
{"text":"We came for lunch out with our kids, and we really enjoyed ourselves. We tried the chili, stuffed pepper soup, grilled chicken sandwiches, the Rachael, and a grilled cheese. All of the sandwiches came with fresh cut fries, and the boys were super excited and gobbled them up! Our plates all went back to the kitchen empty, a very good sign for this family. For dessert, we tried the peanut butter pie and the strawberry pie. Both were delicious too. Our family wants to come back and try breakfast here next."}
{"text":"This was a disgusting two meals that should not  have been served... The chicken stir fry was a none descript mess with the chicken and veggies were  all a bland brown color and had no flavor... The wife couldn't finish it... My open face roast beef and mashed potatoes was served with gravy that was so thick it had the consistency of pudding and the mashed potatoes were hard and had been sitting for hours and reheated... We left the restaurant with out finishing the meals... A real disappointment for a local eatery..."}
{"text":"Average at best. Waitress and bar staff were super nice and the menu has a lot of variety.  My kids had chicken fingers fries and apple sauce and they were all very pleased. My wife and I split a chicken sandwich and a patty melt.  The food took a long time in general and both the chicken and burger in the patty melt were overcooked aka well done and not in a good way.  I'm thinking maybe they didn't have enough kitchen staff although the place was not very busy at the time.  After a few bites of the chicken sandwich I was waiting for the waitress to come back and check on us as I was going to ask for some barbecue sauce but she never came until we were pretty much finished eating."}
{"text":"This is a great, small town diner.  I can not speak for lunch, but Breakfast is great.  Portions are large, the menu is simple and the price is very good.  The folks inside are very friendly.  There were three of us for breakfast and got out for less then a twenty.

One of the items that I had was the 'Army Breakfast.'  I believe that was the name.  Anyway, have served several years in the Army, a little curios.  Eggs, sausage, hash browns, gravy and toast.  I was trying to recall why this would be special.  Then it was delivered.  So id you were never in the military and never was fed out of a Mermite container out in the field, this would not make sense to you.  But if you did, BANG, all of the memories will come flooding back.  There it was, scrabbled eggs (flop), potatoes (flop) smothered in gravy so you can choke it down.  But in this case, they were not green/gray eggs, they were perfect fluffy eggs.  The hash browns were not floating in grease, they were cooked perfectly and the gravy was homemade.  Just like you prayed for it to be when it was 40 degrees and raining on you back in the day.  Perfect."}
{"text":"Great Food at a great price.
We have eaten here 3 times and the food is pretty good.
The place is clean & expanding."}
{"text":"I come here over and over for the breakfast which you can taste the free range in the eggs.  The bacon is above par as well.

I never pass up the fish sandwich.  But they have much more and daily specials.  Homemade soups.

Watch for more to come."}
{"text":"All of us arrived as planned, we had a reservation, we were not a surprise group.   Throughout the progression of ordering to bringing food to the table for 17 people, it required an hour of our time.  Half of us had our salads who ordered them as part of their meal.   The others had to wait while someone found a place opened to buy more produce .  Those salads were, in some  cases, delivered to the customer after their main meal.   The old lady waitress (owner??) blamed the younger waitress for the lack of efficiency in the kitchen(???) , she also mentioned something unkind about the kitchen helpers/cook.

The food was NOT as advertised.   I had entered this eatery believing it was Spaghetti night; it was stated as such on their the Web site. But it was not.

Food on a scale of 1-10 was about a 4.  Poor links between reality and Web site, as well as obvious poor planning and preparation on management's part, 2 people working the whole place, don't know how many in the kitchen were available.  Nothing offered to stay the wait like a free appetizer or a reduced bill, either.  Bread served as two pieces per meal,  if your meal included bread.   Why not just a basket?   Butter was distributed at about 17 people, 17 pats. 

I would NOT recommend this restaraunt for those reasons stated above.   Nobody took responsibility or expressed kindness except for Ashley.   She was most diligent and kind.   I do believe 17 people learned where not to eat, last night, unless they bring a lawyer and a basket of pre-configured questions to help with preparation, inefficiency, and delivery of services. Sign a contract and hope for the best.  

Come to think of it,  McDonald's was across the street, we should have gone there, maybe. The 25$ for two of us may have been better spent. 

Truly one of the poorest dining-out experiences I have had in several years.  Expensive, clean, but poorly managed at the customers expense, literally."}
{"text":"The Chili was so delicious!  The side salad was so tasty. Olives, croutons, beets, several lettuces. Very clean!! Coconut cream pie was delicious too. Service rocked!"}
{"text":"We went there Friday evening for the all you can eat fish fry. They were out of Yuengling draft (boo), and the only other draft beer was Bud Lite (I'm not a fan), so oh well. But the cole slaw was excellent (creamy dressing with a nice blend of sweet and sout), the fish was good and served piping hot, and the fries appeared to be fresh cut. The triple berry pie I chose for dessert was very good; reminded me of a blackberry cobbler. Service was fast and friendly. We'll definitely go to Jake's again!"}
{"text":"Definitely that quintessential Small Town America \"hole-in-the-wall\" diner with pretty decent eats and lots of local warmth.

We visited on a Saturday which was obviously family night - all the booths occupied and the long tables, too.  It was Karaoke night with pretty much all of the town howling.  One kid was pretty good with her rendition of a One Republic song but the adults mostly took turns backing a car over the same cat all night.

Quesadilla appetizer with chicken was tasty if not small - just a tortilla folded over and cut into 3 pieces.  Recipe was different than ordinary quesadillas in that it had a sweet and smokey flavor.

The seared ahi tuna with wasabi, ginger, and Asian-inspired spaghetti on the side was bizzare for a place like this yet listed as one of their top specialties.  So I said l, what the heck, I'll give it a go!  I mean, what's the worst that could happen eating raw fish in a hick town they pronounce /MAN-ah-way/ right?

It was surprisingly OK - not something I'd completely not order next time.  It think they could refine the recipe by warming up the tuna or slicing it up to get a warm glaze on each slice.  Just because it's raw doesn't mean the inside should be cold.  I think that'd make it perfect and a definite reorder in my book!

A little slow tonight because of the Saturday night cat fest on mic.  All-in-all a decent experience that we'd try again... maybe when the Karaoke is off. ;)"}
{"text":"We were passing through on the way to Michigan and felt we needed breakfast and cocktails. Hey, don't judge, we are on vacation! It was definitely out of the way from the interstate, but the food and the drinks make up for it! Bloody Mary and steak and eggs for myself, and Bloody Mary and vegetable omelette for my girlfriend. The food was delicious, the drinks were strong, and the tab was cheap. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great small town diner. I live out on the West coast and am used to more corporate diners. My in-laws live in Mantua (Frost Glass) and we decided to walk down the street for breakfast here. We were a party of 10 and they seated us quickly. 

I'm a HUGE biscuits and gravy 'connoisseur' (don't quote me on that) and I figured it has to be great in a small town. Millers did not disappoint. As a matter of fact, it was the best I'd ever had. I left the restaurant when all was said and done nearly dancing with joy.

At the end of the day, the service was personable and quick, and the food was awesome. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Heading home on the Ohio Turnpike we missed the rest stop and ended up in Mantua. Millers was a great find, good bar food at reasonable prices. The Dublin Wrap was tasty and the Mac Salad outstanding. Well worth the detour!"}
{"text":"Not a bad bang for your buck if you're on a budget. The service is always friendly & the restaurant is always clean. It takes a little too long for the food to arrive but when it does I am never dissatisfied. It is a cute , slightly old- fashioned mom & pop kinda place that serves your typical American menu. But their peignoirs are homemade by a local resident of Mantua & their cheddar potato soup is delicious!"}
{"text":"Been there twice since I moved to the area. Great comfort place to grab breakfast and lunch. Friendly staff and good food! I'll be sure to be back!"}
