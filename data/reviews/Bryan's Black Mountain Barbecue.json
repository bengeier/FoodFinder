{"text":"frog legs were greasy and tasteless, not done.  absolutely the worst we have ever had, and we eat them often in the midwest."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite places till the pulled pork sandwich got smaller and the price got higher. As if this place wasn't already expensive enough."}
{"text":"We are from the south and know great barbecue. This barely passes."}
{"text":"Wow!

I had been planning on hitting Bryans up for quite awhile.  I'd heard great things and was always bummed out when I was in CC on a Sunday and \"remembered\" that they were closed.  But not today...my phone says it Saturday so I am all good.

Wonderful.  The brisket and pulled pork were awesome.  Yes....that's the way I roll.  Tried both and they were out of this world.  Both came with a side, and the fries were a huge order and tasted great.  They have warm BBQ sauce to use and the buns were buttery and fresh.

I cannot imagine a better tasting BBQ than this.  I just can't.  

Its a small place.  Really a lunch place (to me) more than anything else.  Maybe a weeknight dinner but not a Saturday night kinda joint.  

But once you go you'll be back.  I know I will.

YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Alligator sandwich with chow chow-AMAZING. When travelling into Cave Creek, skip the chain restaurant and eat where the locals go. You will not be disappointed with the menu."}
{"text":"Ok, here is the review after going there 2 times, the first time was 5 stars, the ribs were hot and tender the brisket was great, and the fries were the best I have ever had, service was fast and the people we very nice and the place was very clean.
 Then why 2 star rating you ask,  because when I went back a second time it was a 1 star, the ribs were over cooked and tough, it was like they had them from lunch and were serving them for dinner or they had them from the day before, the fries went from the best I have ever had to really really bad. People were still nice place is still clean but in the end it is about the food and they are not consistant at all, normally I would try a thrid time but not in this case."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! We have used them for catering a few of our parties and we always get rave reviews about how good the meat is, even from people who say they are not big BBQ fans. Their brisket is out of this world and is always the most popular item at our parties. I really like the pork too. If you are in the mood for good BBQ, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This was a really cute little place. We had brisket, cornbread, beans and coleslaw. The brisket was very good. The BBQ sauce had a vinegary flavor which was different but good. The cornbread was amazing. I did not care for the coleslaw but my hubby liked it. We need to discuss the beans. They went straight into the trash, they were sort of spicy and not what we were expecting. I had to take a star off because they just were not good. I suppose though, no bbq joints we've been to in AZ have good beans but we got excited as I make \"cowboy beans\" that are so different and delicious. I think we were expecting them to be like those. That being said, we still plan to return to try the other dishes because what we liked was very good."}
{"text":"We just drove for over an hour to come here and the place is closed. Their website says they are open. Sunday's and even the sign on their front door right now says so. It's Sunday at 1:30pm"}
{"text":"Really good food. And I usually have good service (take out). Order was slightly wrong today which was fine, but the sarcastic comment from the kid cashier sorta soured me on ordering again. I'm sorry, I do not tip on take out orders. If you delivered I would tip 20%. I've never gotten a chitty comment when I pick up a pizza or Pei Wei."}
{"text":"After trying several BBQ places in the Cave Creek area, this is our new go-to spot! Nice atmosphere indoors and outdoors. We really enjoyed sitting outside on nice evening. I got the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw (yummy!) and my boyfriend got the two meat combo 1/2lb of beef brisket and pulled pork with baked potato salad and the brisket chili. Both meats were delicious and I loved the potato salad the best and he loved the chili. The service was fast too. 
You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"BBQ here is amazing. Always a good hearty meal to get after a bike ride. I recommend getting the burnt ends sandwich with fries and a cold one."}
{"text":"First time visitor today and it was awesome.  The pulled pork sandwich was the best by far.  Had previously read some reviews from people who didnt like the sauce but I thought the spicy BBQ sauce was really good.  Way better than that awful sweet stuff you get at a chain. I highly recommend Bryan's....definitely worth the drive from anywhere in the valley."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich is lean and tasty. Fries came out fresh and cooked just right, soft on the inside crispy on the outside. Beans good but I have had better. Very nice space, comfortable and friendly."}
{"text":"Overpriced dry chicken and ribs   Very weird flavor to sauce.  The only thing nice is the atmosphere. Not worth the time"}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork sandwich which was excellent. The service and appearance of the place is great as well. 1 star lowered due to not having Mac n cheese on the menu. What BBQ is complete without Mac n cheese?"}
{"text":"Great BBQ. I have tried everything on then menu and love it all.  The brisket is my favorite. The staff is friendly and courteous.  Bryan is always there to oversee the food prep.  The restaurant is small so you may have a little wait if you want to dine inside.  There are tables on the patio which allow for outdoor dining.  Either way its worth the ride and wait to check it out."}
{"text":"Tried last night .. Clean family atmosphere Portions great slot of meat on ribs found sauce a little salty.  Wife has BBQ chicken said some of the best ever"}
{"text":"It's hard to find good BBQ in the valley. I cook competitive BBQ so that makes my judgement even worse but I have to say, this is one of my favorite places that I've been to in Arizona. Oh yeah, they have a great beer list and It's in Cave Creek so it's a nice little escape."}
{"text":"Long time visitor..first timer at Bryans
 The reviews are spot on. A few of
Us shared the ribs and brisket sandwich . They don't smother the meat with sauce  which helps one appreciate the cook on the meat. Just enough fat to keep it moist. An excellent valance and value.
The olive coleslaw is fine but could use more olives to really differentiate from the norm. The potato salad was perfect."}
{"text":"OK, so we went a bit overboard and ordered way too much food!  But, the good news was that we had leftovers to enjoy at home.  We chose BBMB because of its good ratings on Yelp and in Phoenix Magazine and for its dog-friendly patio area, and really enjoyed ourselves.  

I ordered the pork ribs which were smoke-a-licious and mouth wateringly tangy with the homemade bbq sauce as Phoenix Magazine promised, but I was disappointed that they were more chewy than reported.  I prefer falling-off-the-bones BBQ ribs because they are so messy to eat anyway, and I had to work pretty hard chewing on the ribs here to get every tasty morsel.  Don't know that I'd order a whole rack again.  

But the BBQ chicken was a completely different story..... We took a whole one home, and MAN, was it moist and delicious!  Succulent and flavorful smokiness that did not overpower the chicken itself.  We couldn't understand why BBMB didn't score the #1 BBQ chicken in Phoenix Magazine [they were #2].  

My husband took home the brisket and had a pulled pork sandwich for lunch which he thoroughly enjoyed along with the potato salad.  He said the potato salad deserved its \"Best\" mention\" in Phoenix Magazine's issue on BBQ restaurants in the Valley.  

Next time we're up in Cave Creek, we'll be stopping in BBMB again."}
{"text":"I heard of this place from the radio and wanted to try it out. I love a good BBQ for dinner, but was let down by this place. I've been to just about all the BBQ places in the valley and this is by far the worst of them all. The family and I had pork ribs that had to be cut apart with a knife. We also had brisket that was okay but the BBQ sauce tasted like ketchup. We also had fries, coleslaw, chile and beans. The olive coleslaw was horrible, the olives left a bitter taste that didn't compliment the coleslaw at all. The chile was terrible, didn't even taste like it had any seasonings in it at all. The beans and fries were okay. I can't believe this place has best of Phoenix rewards posted all over the walls. This is the worst in Phoenix. That's just my families opinion that has tried dozens of BBQ places"}
{"text":"Wow! Years later and not only is this place still in business( this is rare in the town of Cave Creek) but they still are consistently great! They have sped up the check out process as well! My favorite Cave Creek restaurant!"}
{"text":"I went to Bryan's yesterday with the family ....What a treat, the staff friendly and the food was off the chart. You can tell when the food was made with love, this was !"}
{"text":"Disappointed, I heard good things and the brisket and ribs were defiantly below par, even the gent that recommended this BBQ was saddened in the quality we had that day... So we came back a week later, the brisket was better, great smoke tender and juicy- the ribs were worse, dry and very tough to tear from the bone, the corn bread ( brisket oil fried) was so dry, I think Arizona water table went down an inch as we were trying to wash it down.

Over all it seems to be inconsistent at best, the sauce was very ketchup tasting, thick and bland the second time compared to the week before, the ribs were undercooked with very little smoke to them, the brisket was night and day from one week to the other, coleslaw was basic... The pickled jalapeño was great, would do those again. 

I sure don't want to be over critical, obviously as my friend is a BBQ hound he has had very good here and I am beyond picky as I do go out of the way for the best, to the point of waiting in two hour long lines... So if you catch them on a good day, this can be a go to place, maybe just growing pains... But to be world class as some of the signage would portray, consistency may get them there."}
{"text":"Bryan's is probably the best barbecue I've ever tasted. The brisket is moist and tasty. The pulled pork is as good as anything you'll find in Carolina. The ribs are as good as the Rib Crib in North Philly without the pictures of Malcolm X on the wall! I've traveled through Texas, salt lick, county line and this ranks up there with the best"}
{"text":"Still my favorite place in the area for my BBQ fix."}
{"text":"Pet friendly patio was a huge plus! The food was delicious and the fries portions are huge! We had the brisket and the pulled pork- both had great flavor and the seasoning on the fries was perfect!"}
{"text":"We are frequent diners at Bryan's and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves true smoked bbq food. Ribs, chicken, pulled pork or brisquet it is all declicious! Sides are awesome (you gotta try the baked potatoe salad) and the new brisquet and black eyed pea chili is fabulous. Overall if you are in the North Valley, it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Texas...think I know a little bit about BBQ, just a bit. Best around!  My husband loves the sauce so much he makes bloody Mary's with it! The pulled pork is amazing and although I'm more traditional about my cole slaw, grandma makes the best, it is very good.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had the smoked lamb special. It  was great!  My daughter had the pulled pork sandwich...amazing!! My wife had pulled chicken and beef  brisket and also loved it! 50 different beers to select by the bottle. I love the casual and fun environment of this restaurant! I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I never cared for pulled chicken, till I came here. It actually melted in my mouth, it was that tender and tasty. This was my husbands dish along with his brisket that was smoky goodness!
I ordered the pulled pork and ribs. The pork was good. But nothing compared to the chicken. The ribs were carmelized and very good. However, I was expecting something more tender.
I got the beans which were pretty darn good, with chunks of meat in them. And the baked potato salad. Which I would order again.
My husband had the olive slaw, a bit salty for me, but I liked the change from regular slaw. And beans. Both meals were served with toast.
I wish they were open later on the weekends."}
{"text":"Not bad BBQ. I'm from Texas. Hate that if you want, but like Tex-Mex, I have a Texas slant on BBQ that folks from Memphis, Chicago, Atlanta, etc, do not have. Meat shoudl stand on his own merit and not need sauce or cole slaw to make it work. That said, I've been unable to find good Texas BBQ since coming to AZ. I checked out all the places in Tucson and slowly been working through greater PHX. Bryan's is the closest place to me, but the open hours never seem to jive when I'm in Cave Creek. 

Upon entering I was beside myself to see several varieties of Shiner beer. I thought, \"This guy is from Texas.\" Nope, but his wife is. The brisket was lean, smoky and perfectly done. The smoke ring was evident but not as thick as you might see with longer pit time. The ribs were great. Very, very good. Sauce was tasty and sides, potato salad and beans, up to par. 

Overall, very good good. The only downside I saw was the lack of a sausage choice. But, he said he was looking at including it at a later date."}
{"text":"Bryan's is another new favorite.  I have now tried the chili and the chicken and found both to be excellent.  (Make sure to get the full order of chili, which comes with some incredibly delicious toast that is worth the extra time on the stair master.)  Their chili is a unique, black eyed pea and brisket chili and I absolutely loved the flavor.  It's got a bit of heat but nothing that most of us \"youngsters\" can't handle.  (My husband and I have found that we are some of the youngest people around our area of Carefree and not only does it not bother us, we're loving it, feeling like 40 year old \"spring chickens,\" haha.

Next time you are in the area, make sure to stop by Bryan's.  Great, quick service, atmosphere and food make it a good choice when you're in the mood for BBQ."}
{"text":"This is a great place for excellent brisket! The sauce is just spicy enough! This is the only place our family eats BBQ!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  By far the best BBQ in the North Valley.  The only downside is the lack of seating.  Great sauces, baby back ribs are delicious,  corn bread is spectacular and all of the sides are great.  The staff  are always friendly.  Give it a try next time you go to Cave Creek, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Every week we get a hankering for this place, and we never regret giving in to it! 

It's a very, very casual place and we've never had a problem getting our food fast. It's an order and seat yourself kinda place but we've often had staff come to our table to see if we needed anything.

 I know some people complain that the prices are a little high, but the uniqueness of the sides definitely makes up for it. The coleslaw is not your typical mayonnaise-laden mess, but instead is fresh and has a unique twist that includes green olives. The potato salad is also top-notch. I'm a bit of a fries addict and these are really great steak-cut fries. Be careful how much you eat though because you'll get very full from these. Of course I don't follow my own advice...

The meats of course are what seal the deal. We have had almost every item on the menu and have never been disappointed. The sauce is also excellent and you are able to serve yourself as much as you'd like, warm at that. 

We make sure to buy a bottle of the bbq sauce every other week. For those who claim the sauce is watery...it's because it doesn't contain a bunch of corn starch which is a binder and thus would thicken it. Instead, Bryan uses fresh ingredients and you can definitely tell. 

It's also great to see Bryan at his place actually cooking every single time we've been there. They do have a great beer selection and even carry some wines if, like me, that's what you prefer. 

I've had bbq at almost every other place in the valley and this is definitely the best. Thankfully we only live ten minutes away but I'm sure we'd make the drive even if we lived further away. Cave Creek is a great town so I think Brian's is an appropriate location. Do yourself a favor and give Bryan's a try!"}
{"text":"THE best bbq in Arizona! The food is amazing here. The chili is to die for and the ribs are delicious! 

Great environment and located in the small town of cave creek/care free. 

One of my favorites when im in town."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is the epitome of BBQ. Having some of the best BBQ in the Midwest and Texas, this place is a serious competitor. When my friend and his wife told me they were taking me to eat BBQ while visiting them in PHX, I was reluctant and not expecting too much. I was pleasantly surprised and very pleased with their menu and the quality of the food, dry ribs, BBQ sauce, and hot sauces. Everything is perfect and I am so glad I had the chance to eat here. Leaving to PHX in 4 days and will for sure be there at least once. 

As a side note - - I wish I could find a place like this in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I feel that I am BBQ snob. I've had BBQ in NC, SC, TN, GA, MO, TX and almost every other corner of the US. Restaurants, competitions, tastings, etc. 

I've been to be very few BBQ places that I would return to as I would rather fire up my 250 lb smoker and spend a day making my own. 

I finally tried Bryan's about a month ago and I've already returned....from me, that is a huge compliment. 

There is limited parking in front and I had to go up a hill and park in a dirt lot both times but hey, it's Cave Creek and experience is part of it. 

I like the ribs but loved the brisket!  The sliced brisket is just awesome. Great texture, great flavor, perfect smoke ring, good bite and juicy. 

It's very easy to under (chewy) or over cook (dry) brisket but these guys get it right. I'm not a big fan of lots of sauce on my BBQ but tried it.  They have two sauce's; a spicy and a regular. I wasn't a fan, but to me, the sauce isn't important anyway since I usually pass on it.  It was thin like many vinegar sauces but really seemed more watery than anything else. Not very sweet, not sticky. 

The side were ok. The olives in the slaw didn't really work for me and the potato salad had a bit too much mayo for my likes.

Regardless, I didn't go there for the sides and they sure wont prevent me from returning. I will gladly drive there every time I have an urge for brisket an don't feel like cooking it myself  (it's better than mine anyway)"}
{"text":"Fan-flipping-tastic! The staff is so friendly, the place is clean, and the bbq is like none other. I've gone here a few times, and they do not disappoint. The pulled chicken is to die for, but everything has been great! The bread and butter jalepenos are the icing on the cake, nice and spicy! It's affordable, kid-friendly, and located in adorable downtown Cave Creek. Check this place out and you will not have a regret! It's the best bbq I've had in Phoenix aside from Fritzi's in Avondale."}
{"text":"Got there right before the dinner crowd formed. There is no wait staff, so you enter the place and get in line and place your order, expect a wait! You take your drinks and head to a table and wait to be called for your order. We ordered the pulled pork sandwiches with fries and their olive coleslaw. When you go to get your order you have to get through all the people at the soda station to get your food. It's a just a odd layout but the rest of the place is decorated well. Well the barbecue is everything the customers rave about. Smoky and seasoned just right with a great sauce and is served on a toasted bun. The french fries are crisp and cooked perfectly. The olive coleslaw was not a winner with the wife and was just ok with me. We both had a wheat beer that is brewed for Bryan's and was really good. But if you want a second be prepared to go back through the long line or just order 2 when you place your first order. There is no menus just sign boards up above the ordering station, so you might want to go online and check out the menu before going. Go have a good time and see you in line!"}
{"text":"Clean & well decorated but a little hidden so look closely for it in the corner of the building. Had the sliced Brisket which was well smoked with great flavor. About as tender as you can make it. I am guessing it isn't smoked low and slow due to the shallow smoke ring however I don't think that hampered the taste at all. It was just a touch on the dry side but otherwise very good.

Sauce wasn't the best I have had but that is all personal preference. I will return to try the pork ribs!"}
{"text":"I would easily give this place 5 stars if the hours didn't suck so bad.  I cannot believe it closes at 8PM and it's closed on Sundays  ??  They miss out on a lot of business because of this.  Besides that,  its the best bbq in Arizona that I know of. Service is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Bryan has a winning combination in Cave Creek!  It is worth a drive to taste some of the best BBQ in Phoenix.  The place is cute with old silent movies playing and really lends to the Cave Creek backdrop.  Do not expect an eye popper when you walk in, but expect some great food when you eat.  My wife and I cannot seem to stay away....
if we lunch, we order a brisket and a pulled pork sandwich if dinner, we split a slab of ribs and two sides. Our favorite sides are beans and slaw... both unique and great tasting.   

I just ate an sandwich for lunch (she may be upset) and can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Greatest BBQ around!!! My only fear is that I'm eating there too often.  Pulled pork and chicken with the beans and coleslaw.   Gluten free!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing ribs and pulled pork! Sauce not overpowering. Potato salad has sour cream and dill in dressing, which I love. Fries were seasoned. The best I've had had in this area. Plenty of bottled beer to choose from."}
{"text":"Best SOUTHWESTERN BBQ in Cave Creek!
Best and only Dogfish Craft selection in Cave Creek !"}
{"text":"Brisket and pulled pork very good, fries also. Nice dog friendly patio. Would go back for sure"}
{"text":"Loved the pulled pork and the baked beans.  Nothing fancy, but great barbecue!"}
{"text":"Possibly one of the best barbecue places I've ever been to.  The pulled pork is absolutely amazing! The pork is perfectly Smokey and the bun is amazing! I never get tired of their sides like the cowboy beans and chili. Bryan never ceases to amaze."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good BBQ, look no further!  I ordered the ribs and they practically fell of the bone.  You could tell they really cared about the food they were serving.  I am new to yelp but wanted to share my experience, cause it was just that good!"}
{"text":"Super Tasty food- Fave is the chicken!
 Ribs are not as great as you would think, but the fries are amazing too!
Staff are always friendly and Bryan always seems to be working there!
 They have plenty of choices for food and good sized portions!

 You need to eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"I can not believe i have been here 5 years and today was my first time.  It was great. I have nothing else. Must stop in Cave Creek"}
{"text":"I had the combo plate. The ribs were dry and tough. The brisket was average. Great potato salad. My wife had the half chicken. She said the chicken wasn't very good. The cole slaw and beans were very good."}
{"text":"The best barbecue I've had in Arizona, time and time again. This place never disappoints. Great patio seating perfect for cooler AZ temps and really cool industrial interior design of the restaurant with versatile seating from two people to a really large group. Great options for the non-pork or vegetarian eaters, too!"}
{"text":"Sooo I'm a Texas boy, so BBQ is in my blood. I;ll keep this short and sweet. The BBQ is REALLY good. But no sausage???? Seriously??? es were a little high. ( Or a lot high!) Otherwise, very cool atmosphere, great BBQ, and HEY you are in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"Nothing is worse than going to a restaurant everyone raves about then experiencing the worst, most deplorable behavior by the owner.

I was excited to try Bryan's BBQ.  My husband and I went with 2 other couples.  What we witnessed  was inexcusable behavior by the owner because a customer told him the service and food weren't up to par.

The owner viciously yelled at the customer and then yelled into the restaurant that she wanted a free meal. 

His response, no matter how the customer presented their issues, is unacceptable. He should be embarrassed.

His behavior alone has now cost him customers.    It appears  the positive reviews have gone to his head.  A little humility gets a person farther in life."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing! Not really sure what else to say. I had the beef brisket sammie and literally moaned after every bite!

I'm from the Chicago area, and over the years I have been lucky enough to have some of the most amazing BBQ, as my ex was on somewhat of a quest to find the best joints in the city. His family owned a BBQ joint south of Chicago and he learned to smoke some of the best BBQ I've ever put into my mouth. Bryan's is right up there, without a doubt. 

The only reason I gave it 4 stars as a opposed to 5 had nothing to do with the food...long lines (obviously, because it's phenomenal food!) and slow service. The tables that were empty still hadn't been cleaned off. We ended up outside at the large circular bar, though it was difficult for my 8 year old son to eat his food because his chin was pretty much even with the top of the bar. 

We will be back during our next trip...and likely more than once this time!"}
{"text":"WOW! I am not joking, I just ordered the Tomato sandwich, which they only have for the summer, and it is hands down, the best thing I have ever eaten in my life.

Juicy Tomatoes, fresh bread, I have died and gone to heaven.

This is a problem since I work across the street, I will be back many times for just this sandwich!

Great job guys! Also great location, and love the decor inside. Makes me a proud Creeker when I eat things this delicious. 

THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Love the BBQ , little too pricey but it worth it , the things is i told my friends about it and we drove 33miles on a Sunday and it was closed , OMG i was pissed , I checked the website and yelp it says we are open 
If you are a popular restaurant and value your customers update your website ,yelp and etc."}
{"text":"We really enjoy Bryan's. It has a great atmosphere, is incredibly clean, has really friendly staff and I think it's amazing that Bryan is always there working front and center. 

The BBQ is great (we've had the ribs, brisket, pulled pork and chicken) and the sides are pretty good too, I just wish they would expand their variety a bit (hence why I docked a star). I'm missing something like cheesy potatoes or mac and cheese! You can get fries, dill potato salad, green olive coleslaw or cowboy beans. I'm not the biggest fan of the beans, but I like everything else. All meals come with a house-made pickled jalapeno too, if that's something you're interested in! 

The meat is served with sauce, but it's pretty stingy so make sure to visit the counter along the wall to get either spicy of original sauce. I love that they keep it heated so you can pour warm sauce all over your dinner! Also, if you buy Bryan's cookbook (which is great - all his restaurant recipes are in there!) he will sign it for you. We just made the dill potato salad this weekend and it tasted just like it does in the restaurant. 

A couple notes: 

It gets REALLY busy on the weekends and closes at 8 so make sure to get there early if you don't want to wait in a long line and stand around lurking for a table

Be careful if you order the chocolate chip ice cream cookie sandwich (not worth the calories if you ask me!) It comes out frozen solid and I almost broke a tooth on the darn thing!"}
{"text":"Still perfect after all these years.... Gotta love the INCREDIBLE tender, flavorful brisket with Bryan's spicy sauce. The potato salad recipe is worth buying his book for, and the fries are the best I've had anywhere. Cornbread made with brisket grease is worth the drive from Tucson!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! Staff is always  friendly!! But please do something to move that line faster!!  One register with chatty customers means a lot of time on our feet in line. The line has a tendency to go out the door scaring customers away. I have watched families walk away on several visits."}
{"text":"I LOVE Bryan's. Yes ... it's just a little more $ than a place like Honey Bears, but Bryan is a foodie and he is very serious about his BBQ. He is usually standing behind the counter preparing the food so you can easily talk to him. He's friendly and very approachable. There is always something interesting and definitely unusual on the menu that you can try if you are adventurous. I enjoy the pulled pork sandwiches, but my favorite is the summer tomato sandwich with a fried egg on top -- it's even better when the tomatoes are room temperature rather than just out of the walk in."}
{"text":"Five of us went to Bryan's for dinner.  The table agreed the brisket was by far the best thing any of us had.  It wasn't dry as one of the other reviewers mentioned, but it was incredibly tender.  The brisket is the only reason we gave it three stars.  

I know barbecue can be pretty personal on preference but none of us liked the pulled pork at all.  We ended up throwing it away!  The beans were a bit spicy (which I liked others did not).  The coleslaw was average as was the chili.  I am told the ribs were also fine but not great, so really other than the brisket there wasn't much to rave about."}
{"text":"Bryan Dooley is the most creative and 'chef' oriented barbecue soul we have ever had the pleasure to meet and certainly Bryan's BarBQ right off Cave Creek rd is absolutely not to be missed! Bar b q brisket perfectly smoked and  and tender and juicy! I literally drank both sauces! Both vinegar- based! One a lil 'hotter' but both so incredible! Chicken outstanding! We are back for our second summer only tomato sandwich! Best  sandwich I have ever had! Red and yellow, lil watercress, lil onion and some kind of whallopin' good Dijon sauce! Yoeza! Bread butter toasted on grill! Mouth currently watering! Do but some sauce and brya/ rub to go! Aaaaand! Buy his cookbook! Incredible recipes from his gourmet BarBQ place!"}
{"text":"Think you can't get a delicious vegetarian meal in a backwards hick town like Cave Creek?  WRONG!  

Bryan's Black Mountain Barbecue looks like your average barbecue joint.  They have a wagon wheel chandelier and some rustic decor.  But they also have a barbecue \"pulled squash\" sandwich that blows my mind!  It approximates the texture of pulled pork, and is covered in delicious barbecue sauce on a toasty bun. When I found out about this sandwich, I finally had an excuse to take my vegetarian, sandwich-loving boyfriend to visit my lame hometown that I'm always complaining about.

The side dishes, like fries and cole slaw, are also really tasty.  I can't speak about their other entrees, because I'm a vegetarian and the squash one is my only option.  But it's so delicious I'm not going to complain.  My only complaint is that I get nervous that they're going to take it off the menu because not enough Republican retirees are ordering it, and I will have made the 40 minute drive from Phoenix for nothing.

Definitely worth the trip for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Try one of the combination plates.  This time I had the barbeque beef brisket and pulled pork, with chili, French fries, and olive coleslaw.  A tasty, filling combination that reminds me to the Texas barbeque plates that I enjoyed in Houston and Dallas."}
{"text":"This is a really great, casual, BBQ place. We are there at least once a week and I am so happy I got a signed copy of Bryan's CookBook for my Birthday. I already made the Baked Potato Salad! I'll leave the Pulled Pork and Brisket to Bryan - he has it down to an art. Good Food and Fun!"}
{"text":"The best! Worth the drive and the wait.  Pulled chicken sandwich was tender and fresh. The French fries are great as well."}
{"text":"Just tried Bryan's Black Mountain Barbecue for the first time.  Loved it.  I was adventurous and ordered the Ostrich Sloppy Joe.  Excellent!  This southern girl had to try the cornbread...delicious.  Hats off to the Chef."}
{"text":"Been here every time I roll into town. Never disappoints with the excellent food and the very friendly staff. Reasonable prices no wonder it's usually packed."}
{"text":"I've been to Brian's barbecue many times. The sauces are pretty good the meet is pretty good. The only downside is I feel like they continue to raise the price over that time quite a bit. The lady that was taking order did not seem to be the happiest kind a rude but not directly route if that makes sense LOL. We might be back again but not feeling like we're missing out if we don't!! I love the support local businesses. I like to see you smile's and friendly people as well."}
{"text":"The bad~
Not sure what all the hype is.  I live in Cave Creek and think there are better places to dine.  First of all, the BBQ is not Southern Style.  No sweetness or spice to the sauce, nor is it thick.  The side selection is terrible & very, very limited.  Potato salad with a ton of sour cream & dill, & more sour cream.  I'm from the South & BBQ is usually at least served with corn on the cob.  And who has heard of putting olives in Cole slaw? 
Don't expect to get a cup of coffee or even dessert. 

The good~
The brisket was tender.  All sandwiches served on a plain but buttered white roll.  It is very clean, but always very crowded."}
{"text":"Just past the DQ on the right.   Hard to believe you can get great southern bbq, in AZ.  Bryan is perfect.  Priced cheap too.  Super clean.  I agree teh movies need to go, maybe put on some SEC football!!!

The ice cream sandwhich was a perfect finish.  

I had brisket and ribs.  

They close promptly ay 9PM"}
{"text":"The very best BBQ we have ever had and we've had the best that the Southeast has to offer.  Bryan and his wife run one of the best restaurants I have ever been too.  It says something when the owner is running the expo line every time you go in.  We love their steamed shrimp in the summer and ribs year round.  The process by which Bryan smokes these ribs infuses a flavor into the meat that is out of this world.  Order the \"Big Pig\" for an awesome pile of fries, chili, meat, sour cream, and peppers.  Dang it, I'm hungry now!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but however decent the food may be, I just can't frequent a barbecue restaurant that misspells the word 'barbecue' in its name.  \"Barbeque\" would be pronounced \"barbeck.\"

Yes, I know that this misspelling has become so common that many dictionaries now allow it as an \"alternate\" spelling.  But it's still WRONG.  There is no word in ANY language in which the suffix \"que\" is pronounced \"cue.\"  

The next time you want to say 'what' to a Spanish speaker (que?), say \"cue?\" and see if he or she knows what you're talking about.  ;)"}
{"text":"I was so pumped to try this place and I think the anticipation killed it for me after having  my first rib. Everyone has their own cup of tea as far as flavors but the bbq sauce tasted like marinara. Most people love this place but the next time I'm in Cave Creek I'll be trying some place else."}
{"text":"Wife and I rode our bikes up to Cave Creek this past Sunday.  We usually eat at one of the popular biker bars but today we thought we would try something a little different, and that's where Bryan's entered the picture.  
Located in a secluded small \"arts\" strip mall, I had my doubts.  Entered the restaurant and immediately the smell of BBQ permeated my nostrils.  The place had a real nice vibe, the interior was rustic yet had a finished look.  But enough of that, the food was why we were here.  You get in line and order at the register.  The wife ordered her standby of a beef brisket sandwich with one side.  She ordered the Irish coleslaw.  I ordered pulled pork with fries.
We elected to sit outside on the patio and waited for our name to be called.  The patio is pet friendly.
But back to the food, both sandwiches were served on a toasted bun.  My pulled pork was stacked high with a homemade BBQ sauce.  This is not only a big sandwich, but a really tasted one, a true meal on a bun.  Reminded me of Pork and Fork several years ago, not the skimpy sandwich they serve now.  The bun alone was a major difference as well as the portion.  Combine that with their crunchy, hot and plentiful.  And the final touch, the pickled pepper was the best.  Plus I got to eat my wife's pepper, double my pleasure.  Almost forgot, the wife's brisket, served on the same toasted bun, topped with Bryan's BBQ sauce.  Again it was huge, moist and definitely a meal on a bun.  Her side was the Irish coleslaw, nothing exceptional here but still enjoyable, a 3 at best.  
Bottom line, we will be back and plan to share our newest find with friends.  Oh can't forget, they serve Frog Legs on Fridays!!!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is YUM!!!! A friend recommended this place and after reading the reviews I had to try it. And I'm glad I did!! Got the pulled pork, and their sauces are amazing add ons!"}
{"text":"Bryan's perfectly seasoned, impeccably cooked, impressively meaty ribs make for a succulent feast.   I only pity the next rib joint that pushes a rack my way expecting to measure up.   I cavalierly requested a full slab of Bryan's beauties before being talked down by a wise friend who pointed out that the half usually goes far enough for two.  And it sure could have in my case.

A stellar smokiness permeates every bite of Bryan's ribs.  The barbecue sauce is more complex and flavorful than most.  All in all, a memorable, indulgent meal."}
{"text":"This will not be the last time I eat here. I enjoyed a pulled pork sandwich on a toasted bun, olive cole slaw, and brisket chilli. The pork was tender,  juicy, and a just-right smokey flavor. Super clean cooking area and dining room.  Outdoor seating is available. I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"This place has had great reviews, but don't get overly excited.  This is good BBQ, but nothing exceptional.  Nothing unusual here."}
{"text":"This the best BBQ place I have been to in Phoenix. It may not look high-end, but the service and food is excellent. My only complaint is the time it takes to complete the order, however, that is understandable because of the taste and freshness."}
{"text":"What can I say, Bryan's is the BEST.  I have been going there literally since the day it opened.  I have never had anything I didn't like.  The BBQ chicken is most, the brisket is tender.  You must try the caramel corn-on-the-cob when it is in season!"}
{"text":"You will not find a better BBQ place in the valley.  From the Pulled pork to the Ribs, everything is excellent. 

The only change I would make is to the sides.  I think they got a little to creative.  The potato salad is still good though.

Another feature I enjoy is their seasonal specials, like the watermelon and jalapeño dish."}
{"text":"It's about as close to perfect as perfect can get...

Everything is hot, fresh, and delicious every time without exception.

Bryan and his entire crew take quality very seriously and as BBQ places go, you will be hard pressed to find a more carefully managed establishment.

Everything about Bryan's is excellent; the food, the service, and even the cleanliness (which is something many BBQ places don't consider important).

We've been patronizing Bryan's since they opened, and we're glad to know our first impression was correct: This place is one for the ages. 

A legacy, that will define Cave Creek barbecue for decades to come.

CNN, USA Today, Chanel 3 and Chanel 5 agree... as do all Creekers and most people in the north part of the valley.

By the way, the tomato sandwich (seasonal) is to die for."}
{"text":"Had a lunch at Bryan's Black Mountain Barbecue and I will tell you I was disappointed.  First the positives: this restaurant is very nice inside and out! A cool dig to hang out for a beer or two with friends.  The Brisket good the French Fries excellently! The sauce just ok.  Now the negatives, since I was a first timer to this restaurant, and I had my family with me, I decided to order the pull pork, the ribs, and the brisket. I did not try the chicken because there is no way to mess up a rotisserie chicken right? (Maybe). But any how the Brisket was the best of the meats as it was juicy and lightly smoked. The pork ribs and pulled pork tasted three days old! The ribs even had a left on the bone too long smell.  The rib meat was hard like jerky! The pull pork was left in fridge and you could taste it!  My wife leaned over to Me and my boys, so no other patron could hear, and she said \"if I want to have left overs I would have stayed home\". I think her words pretty much sum up this restaurant experience. Pretty pricey for left overs!"}
{"text":"I can see that Phoenix Magazine is doing its job, as I am not the only person to go try Bryan's after reading the article.  However, it also looks like people who have written reviews here have very picky tastes and particular thoughts about exactly what their BBQ should be like.  That's what makes BBQ so great!  The debate rages on...

For what it's worth, I side with the Bryan's lovers here.  This place is worth the drive out the Cave Creek.  From the second you park your car and get out, you can smell the delicious-ness.  Your mouth will be watering before you get in the door.

The menu is the standard BBQ fare you would except for one twist - the pulled squash sandwich.  ***Vegetarians unite***  No longer does the BBQ community cast you aside for there is a fantastic sandwich waiting for you.  For the sandwich, they used spaghetti squash, heat it up, and finish it on the grill with BBQ sauce & a toasted bun.  It was fan-freaking-tastic.  I liked the squash so much I got it as a side when I went back with the family in tow.

I also had the brisket & chicken.  My partners in crime volunteer to round out our menu orderings and got the ribs and pulled pork.  The brisket was super tender, and the chicken was moist.  It's easy to dry chicken out, and I give much props for a delicious bird.  The best were the ribs though.  Not only did they look perfect, outer crunch of caramelized sauce and a subtle smoke ring, but tasted damn near perfect too.

As for the sauces, I will say they aren't nearly as bad as some people here claim.  They aren't as thick and over-flavored like grocery store versions, but they are good.  They are thinner and have a nice acidic vinegar pop.  They were a perfect touch to the pork & chicken.

I think the thing that helped set this a part from other places was the killer craft beer selection.  if one more person offers me a bud or coors light with BBQ, I might cry.  Good food deserves good brew, and this place has an ample supply of great flavors that would pair well with anything.  Bryan, who is usually there working, knows his stuff.

Other great stuff - look for the specials.  The night the fam went, we split an order of fresh watermelon drizzled with Jalapeno-Cardamom Honey & topped with diced Jalapenos.  It was incredible.

Make the drive & try for yourself."}
{"text":"I have been to this place two times now and both times impressed. I am a sauce guy so I focus on the barbecue sauce. I have to say that on a stand alone basis their sauce is not to my taste, that is to say I would not been spooning it out of the container as I have been known to do with others. However, when you combine the sauce on the actual dishes such as ribs, pulled pork, chicken, etc.... the combination is absolutely delicious. I have eaten several items on the menu and always satisfied. By the way, the brisket chili as a side is just plain awesome. Overall I have to say that they cook / smoke their meats perfectly, everything is super tasty, and I will be happy to go back for more, regardless of the 20 minute drive to get there. I have been living in AZ now for almost a year, and to date this is by far the best BBQ I have had, and I have tried a lot including all of the popular ones.  Go here, eat hearty, and enjoy the full belly feeling you will have when you drive home!!!"}
{"text":"Bryan's BBQ is tucked away in the cute little town of Cave Creek, luckily up the block from my daughter's new school. It is so hard NOT to stop in for dinner everytime I pick her up. Lately it has been a frequent go-to spot for the family when we are too tired to make dinner, or when we want to indulge in the best BBQ we've ever had. The week wouldn't be complete without eating at Bryan's at least once. AT LEAST.

I always get the pulled pork sandwich which has just the right amount of spice and flavor. I always add a little spicy BBQ sauce for that extra kick. The bun is slightly toasted and the edges have that little crunch, while the middle of the bun is soft from the moisture of the pulled pork.  Their fries are addicting, and served as a side in generous heaps with the perfect amount of salt. Their cole slaw has sliced olives- both black and green- which give it a very pleasant and interesting twist. I have yet to try their ribs, because when I find something I like, I stick to it. But after reading some reviews on here I see that it's a must. 

Oh, and you get a free soft drink if you wear a funny hat on Fridays. Not that the place needs to offer this for me to keep coming back. The BBQ is treat enough."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ!! One of my favorite places to go. The food is awesome and the staff is so nice"}
{"text":"Excellent!! The best pulled pork and brisket ever!! We just returned from a trip to Austin & Nashville, we found the brisket and pulled pork to be comparable if not better!!"}
{"text":"Honestly this BBQ is the best! To top it off the atmosphere is perfect and the owners and staff are so nice!!"}
{"text":"Great food, not fast food, not cheap food, but it is good BBQ, nice setting on the patio at night.  My kids liked their ribs, so it all worked out."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I had never been a fan of BBQ until trying Bryans. It is by far my favorite place to eat in Cave Creek and the best BBQ I have ever had! Also their cornbread and corn on the cob is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great barbeque and fast service! I'll stop by anytime I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to this restaurant and we were glad we gave it another shot because we weren't too crazy about our first visit.  

We had ribs the first time and we found them too smoky.  This time we tried the pulled pork sandwiches and they were really good.  The only problem was that the bottom bun was totally and completely soggy but the top wasn't too bad.  The pork itself was really good and I must mention the fries - oh baby!  They were so good!  Sometimes fries don't really taste like much of anything but these fries tasted like they just dug them out of the garden - they had that much potato flavor.  What a treat!  

I agree that there are better barbecue restaurants around but this restaurant is definitely worth stopping at if you're in the neighborhood and have a craving for a pulled pork sandwich (with fries, of course)."}
{"text":"I'm now an Austin BBQ snob so there's no way I can give this place 5 stars but it is a solid place to get food in Cave Creek. 

The ribs and brisket are tender and tasty and the spicy barbecue sauce is among the best BBQ sauces I've had. The coleslaw was watery and the beans were nothing special. I got a special dehydrated cod in rutabaga mash wrapped in phylo (a Nordic dish I think) and it was surprisingly good. 

The place is a cool setup and it's nice to sit outside. Order upfront and pick up your food when it's ready."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Over priced. My half chicken meal was dry with a smear of sauce on it. My son had the brisket and it was also dry. Possibly this a BQ style I just don't care for. Sorry but I won't be returning. For a restaurant with this high of a Yelp rating I must be missing something."}
{"text":"Excellent .. pulled pork sandwich was delicious . BBQ sauce one of the best I've had !!!"}
{"text":"The smell alone is enough to lure you inside.  The pulled pork sandwich was great.  Bryan's offers a regular and a spicy BBQ sauce.  The brisket chili is delicious and the cowboy beans are tasty.  Both of my friends said their half slabs of ribs were good but not they best they've ever had.  The bummer?  NO MACARONI AND CHEESE ON THE MENU!  You gotta be outta your mind to develop a BBQ menu without macaroni and cheese on it."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the meats...they are all delicious and tasty and the spicy sauce kicks me in my mouth in the best way possible.  I have been there 3 times in the last 6 weeks and it will continue to be in my favorite rotation.  The sides are different and don't blow my hair-back but I say keep it simple because the fries are on point and nothing goes better with great bbq than fries.  Keep it simple and keppin on point.  I will see you with my bib tied on tight soon."}
{"text":"Yelp should seriously institute some sort of rating system where the worst reviews can be withheld due to stupidity. Some highlights from the lowest reviews:

Denise R.:

\"It thrown on a paper plate and served in a sloppy fast food style.\"

It's a barbeque joint. These places typically do not come with the white glove treatment. And to top it off, her Yelp quote says \"It is always the simple that produces the marvelous.\" Live by your own mottos Denise.

Dura K.:

\"to be specific if u like the whitest white meat chicken with a smear of nonengaging BBQ sauce, this is for u.\"

What does the \"whitest white meat chicken\" even mean? I doubt many people who go to Bryan's go there for the chicken...

Donna B.:

\"The worse thing was the smokey aftertaste\"

Donna calls herself a foodie and then proceeds to complain about the smoky aftertaste AT A BARBEQUE RESTAURANT! This is seriously one of the dumbest things I've ever read on Yelp. She then tries to shore up her ignorance by stating that her friends are Texans. 

Another common theme with the lower star ratings seems to be with the sauce. Some people tend to feel the sauce was too \"watery.\" I'm really not a fan of the KC style sauce but I understand if that is your thing. I guess I'm just not a fan of covering a pile of slow cooked pork with a ton of super sweet and thick sauce. Instead I chose to review Bryan's for what they do extremely well, and that's prepare a phenomenal pulled pork sandwich. Plenty of smoky flavor (sorry Donna), tender, delicious bits of smoky bark, not over sauced, juicy, and on a nice soft bun that doesn't get in the way of the meat. They also feature a nice selection of premium craft beers. I'm a happy man when I come here.

Look people, it is obviously your right to say whatever you want on here (god bless America.) It's also obvious that the owner of this place did his homework and it shows in his product. When you look past the ridiculous comments about silverware and the like you will find IMHO the best BBQ I've had to date."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the best place in town if you want some authentic BBQ. I think their brisket sandwich is perfect."}
{"text":"Went to Bryan's Black Mountain BBQ in Cave Creek, AZ, party of three.  We ordered pulled pork sandwich, french fries, potatoe salad and cole slaw.  My son had pulled pork with egg on top and cowboy beans.  Bryans has two types of BBQ sauce regular and spicy . Both BBQ sauces were good and the food was excellent.  The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The location is nice, nice new building, clean, had the makings of a nice BBQ joint but a 30 minute wait for a pulled pork sandwich? Really? 

A bun that was burnt around the edges and soggy in the middle. The sandwich was pretty tasteless even with their watery sauces added. The meat tasted like it had been boiled and was extremely watery as well. Fries are nothing special either. Makes me wonder, did Bryan's just do an extra good job at promotions and public relations to get these magazine reviews and plaques on walls? Now, I haven't tried their other selections, which are supposed to be very tasty but I am not sure I will give it another shot if they can't pull off a simple pulled pork sandwhich.

I miss Tony Romas!

P.S. I'm not a jerk, just straight shootin' ;)

P.S.S. I just upgraded it from a 1 star to 2 star for their large portions. I was stuffed."}
{"text":"Great barbeque.  Table of 4 enjoyed lunch of pulled pork sandwiches, and brisket sandwich with sides of fries, beans, coleslaw.  All of it very good.  Clean, and comfortable.  Prompt service.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"Very clean and new inside. Employees were very friendly. That's the good news. The bad news is that the food sucks like no other. It is. In my opinion, the worst food in cave creek.

The say, \"mouth watering bbq\". If they mean when your mouth waters right before you vomit, then yes it is mouth watering.

I love a good cole slaw and potato salad. They have an olive slaw. Olives and slaw don't go together in anyway...unless maybe you are drunk or stoned...you know...like when you don't care and anything will taste ok.

The potato salad was bad as well. All I could taste was mayo and dill. They should change the name from \"baked potato salad\" to \"sh*t salad\"

I felt like I ate a plate of lard after only 3 bites. The pulled pork sucked and so did the brisket.

I've had better food at several truck stops along I10.

My dogs loved it though! But then again they lick their asses all day."}
{"text":"There is absolutely NOTHING bad to say about Bryan's Black Mountain Barbeque!
You will NEVER find another that even comes close to what they offer at Bryan's.
The Pulled pork is AMAZING! The side dishes are FABULOUS!!!
The service is pristine and Bryan and \"the family\" are as good as it gets!
You MUST drive to Cave Creek to enjoy the best tasting food around!

LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and dangerous now that they have to go window. Lots of unique things on menu that are updated regularly making it an adventure, besides the spicy Bbq sauce."}
{"text":"I might be generous giving this a 2 star! The brisket we ordered was ok, the cornbread was dry & tasteless & the side options were very small. We were very excited to find BBQ after moving from Savannah but we were sorely disappointed :("}
{"text":"Well... I am a tough critic when it comes to BBQ. I grew up with BBQ and this was not the same. My wife and I decided to take a Saturday drive and we ended up in CaveCreek. Naturally, we decided to hit up Yelp to see what spots were hopping! We saw this place had a bunch of good reviews and we were excited to see what it had to offer. For starters, keep a close eye when looking for it as you could easily drive by it. (we did twice.) We started to get excited when we parked the car and our senses were taken over by an aroma of BBQ. The entrance was well put together next to some southwestern stores. They had a cool patio and the place had awards hanging all over inside the restaurant. We walked up to begin the order and the staff was very friendly and welcoming to all the questions we had. I was bummed they did not offer baby back ribs :(. I stepped away for a second to use the restroom and I would like to add that it was extremely clean. Upon my return, my wife had ordered pork ribs, chicken, corn, some type of hearts of Romaine concoction, fries, and beans. The fries were very tasty, the salad thing was tangy and almost had a bitter taste. The beans were good. The pork ribs were okay at best. I prefer BBQ when meat is falling off the bones and bbq sauce is everywhere. In this case, I found the ribs to be a little chewy and it almost seemed the the ribs were made the day before. The chicken was pretty good, tender, hot, and the sauce mixed well. The sauce had good flavor and you can taste the quality of the sauce. We thought the prices were pretty steep for what we received in return. $50 bucks for two drinks and the food mentioned above."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Great brisket. Fun place to eat. Good service. We will get back."}
{"text":"The best barbecue I have ever had!!!! I get the BBQ chicken sandwich about once a week at least. If you like to eat light try the romain ribs. It's basically romain wedges with their own lemon dressing."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwiches made by angels from BBQ heaven. Or one ridiculously talented chef, whatever. Well-deserved awards from Best of Phoenix and others lining the walls, along with a guitar that says \"Play Me\" just waiting for anyone to pick up the old acoustic Epiphone and bust a tune or two. 5 stars just for having that in a restaurant! But please, if you are going to make the drive (we came from Gilbert and we would do it again!) they have two seasonal items right now...watermelon slices with jalapeno, honey, and dash of cardamom, and an heirloom tomato sandwich. These two items are only served while they are in season, and I can personally speak for the watermelon that you have never, and will never have it like this. The flavors compliment the watermelon so well; it is so refreshing, sweet, barely spicy, crisp, and just really not what you'd expect. A friend had the tomato sandwhich and was blown away."}
{"text":"Delicious savory barbecue in a variety of sizes and meats; what's not to like. The olive Cole slaw is wonderful and the casual family style dining is a big plus. Not super cheap but great food in a western themed environment. Ordering and pick up is straight forward and there were plenty of tables on a Saturday. In high season it's probably very busy and one taste you'll know why."}
{"text":"As for service it is a 6 star, they were amazing,but we were not a fan of the bbq sauce - it was too vinagery for out tasting, the brisket was ve y nicely cooked"}
{"text":"Growing up in East Texas good BBQ is hard to find in AZ. I've been here several times and it is always great. The brisket just melts in your mouth. One of my AZ favorites is the full rack of Pork Spare Ribs with his Prickly Pear Cactus BBQ sauce on it sitting with a giant pile of crisp french fries with a pickled jalapeno they make in house. It use to be a special and may not be on the menu any more and you may have to ask for it but it is truly yummy. Last time I just ask for it and the owner said sure .. coming right up. We have used them for catering small and large events and the food comes ready to go. Just wish he had some Texas Sausage on the menu. A bit of a drive but well worth it."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure your BBQ isn't that good if the best part of the meal is the French Fries. I got the brisket plate with chili and French Fries. I know the brisket is smoked, but can the meat be over smoked? I feel like I just got done eating a tray of ashes. I taste more of the smoke than I do the meat. The lean brisket was ehhh and the fatty portion was disappointing. The chili was very bland. I only ate two or three scopes before I noticed there wasn't a distinct flavor. As I mentioned, the fries were the best! They were fresh, hot and very crispy. They are the best fries I've had in a long time. So overall, I would never go out of my way to come back. However, I would be interested in trying the lamb. Good Luck! Hopefully your experience is better."}
{"text":"Seriously? BBQ sauce is not like gasoline, it's like ketchup salt pepper mustard etc. Prices are high for mediocre BBQ anyway and you want to charge extra for sauce? Brisket was dry and DEFINITELY needed more of the only fair sauce. Corn bread dry, weird potato salad. Lots of great food in this area and this isn't it."}
{"text":"Loved the BBQ sauces...  super smoky and not much sweet.  I'm not a BBQ person but I rather enjoyed my beef sandwich.  Fries were super tasty and the homemade ice cream sandwich is a winner."}
{"text":"Was in cave creek for bike week and was craving bbq. Stop by and was not disappointed! Excellent food, lamb was amazing. Highly recommended this place, staff provided excellent service. Can't wait for next year!"}
{"text":"Yesterday we had the opportunity to try Bryan's Black Mountain Barbeque - Cave Creek, AZ  and we REALLY enjoyed it!  Good flavor, variety, some surprised and really good food!  We had the dogs with us and that worked well on their patio out front.  LOVED the seating area around the saguaro, very unique.  We collectively had the brisket, pork, chicken sandwiches and a tomato sandwich as well.  They also had this funky watermelon treat that was really unique and really had depth of flavors.

We'll be back for sure and look forward to another meal at Bryan's Black Mountain Barbeque, maybe this time it will be in the evening enjoying more of the patio....   :)

{"text":"Fried egg on pulled pork sandwich unreal.  Summer dessert : watermelon wedge drizzled with spicy honey"}
{"text":"We've been coming here almost since they opened, and seriously love this place.  Food is awesome and some of the best BBQ I've had anywhere.  It's consistent each and every time.  The pulled chicken sandwich topped with Cole slaw is amazing, the beans are fabulous, pulled pork, brisket, etc...all delicious.  However. I was really disappointed when I saw this sign in there recently.  I actually found it insulting.  A simple sign over the BBQ sauce dispenser saying \"please do you best to take only what you will use\" would be much more appropriate.  Unfortunately, as in any business, there are many costs associated with just doing business.  I consider this one of those costs.  It's like saying \"here's a napkin, but you can only have one, that should be appropriate, because it's not cost effective to give you any more.\"  Perhaps an extreme example, but the point is the same.  All that said, I will still go there, because seriously the food is great.  I just think the sign was insulting and bordering on rude."}
{"text":"Have been dying to try this place out.  Came for lunch.  I got the brisket sandwich and it was dry even with the sauce.   I find the prices to be pretty steep also.   Not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"In our 5 months of living in Scottsdale, we have not yet found a truly exceptional barbecue joint.  That is until today.  After hearing about Bryan's Black Mountain Barbecue on Check Please! Arizona (hosted by former Roaring Fork owner Robert McGrath), we decided to venture out to Cave Creek and give it a shot.  My bride ordered a pulled pork sandwich and I ordered a two item platter (pulled pork and more pulled pork, please!)  My side items were potato salad and baked beans, while my wife got potato salad only.  

Our consensus was the pulled pork was truly exceptional--as good as you would find in one of the nationally famous barbecue joints in a place like Kansas City, MO, Austin, TX or Lexington, NC.  There was no fat on the pulled pork, just tender meat that included the blackened part of the pork (burnt ends, in barbecue lingo).  Every bit was delicious.  They offer two sauces to add to the cue, one spicy and one regular, and both are heated so as to not cool down the meat.  The potato salad was similarly tasty, with a great dressing to accompany the freshly diced potatoes.  Only the barbecue beans were, alas, just average.  Unfortunately, we were too stuffed to try either of the dessert items that were available.  The restaurant also offers a variety of beers, some of which are brewed under the Bryan's label.  We both signed a sacred pact that next time we would sample the brisket and the ribs in order to confirm our suspicions that this is a place that belongs in the barbecue Hall of Fame.  By coming in mid-July, we also missed the long lines that many of the other reviewers have commented on.

For those reviewers who gave this place one or two stars, I have two bits of advice:  1.  Go to a Vegan restaurant next time.  2.  Next time you are tempted to write a Yelp review, go in the kitchen with Sydney, Clayton, Mohammed and Jugdish and ponder whether you should find a new hobby."}
{"text":"Finally - a bbq place that is good for the meat eater and a vegetarian! Plus nice indoor and outdoor seating and cute decor. Bryan's has multiple vegetarian options, which is pretty amazing. Things I've had:

- Fried artichoke po'boy: Really good! The artichoke hearts were nicely and lightly fried, the sandwich had an amazing creamy garlic and mustard sauce piled plentifully, the bread was buttered and toasted to a very nice crispiness, and there were fresh tomatoes and real romaine lettuce.
- Pulled Squash: So unique and soooo incredibly good. The bun is buttered to high heaven and combined with the hot squash covered in an amazing BBQ, every bite is just marvelous. Sweet, savory, buttery, smooth, firm, yummmo. I prefer this to the fried artichoke po'boy.
- Baked potato salad: Yummy take on traditional potato salad but I think the french fries are the best side they have (and worth the extra quarter).
- Olive Coleslaw: Not a huge fan of coleslaw, but this seemed better to me than most. Balanced sweetness and the coolness goes really well with the hot Pulled Squash sandwich.
- French fries: Perfect - dark, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside without being mealy, and seasoned nicely. M
- Brisket sandwich: My husband gets this,  and while he said wasn't as good as others he has had, it must still be yummy because he orders it everytime. 

We both really liked the spicy bbq sauce - it's not as sweet as the light color would suggest and it has a really pleasant smokiness to it. Keep in mind that you will be ordering from a counter, getting your own food when called, and busing your own table. I felt a little silly after leaving a 20+% tip the first few times. In any case, I highly recommend Bryan's BBQ for the vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  My go-to BBQ place.  Get the Babyback ribs and brisket.  Load up on the BBQ sauce.  You will not regret this."}
{"text":"LOOOOOVEEEEEEE the ribs here.
Just don't wear white!

We have been here a few times and the ribs are great, the brisket is good. I think I usually stick with the ribs though.
Tasty, smokey, you got it.

There can sometimes be a little wait, but it's ok. Your order of ribs is coming right up!"}
{"text":"The BEST!!!!!! We visited from Sacramento CA!!! We were blown away at how yummers!!! Matter of fact....we came home with 4 bottles of sauce to share with family here!!! Looking forward to returning in a few months!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a busy Saturday afternoon. There was outdoor and indoor seating including booths, tables and a bar outside. Flavored coca cola machine where you could pick your own flavored fountain drink or juice. Got a half rack of pork ribs, potato salad and olive cole slaw. Ribs were huge and half came back with me. Potato salad was amazing with lots if dill. Olive cole slaw had no flavor. Over all pretty good!"}
{"text":"I don't need to say much here.  Read the other 4 and 5-star reviews and look at the pictures.  This place took me right back to Lockhart, TX.  Excellent BBQ!  We had the pulled pork sandwich a la carte, and then the 2 meat dinner with ribs, brisket, beans, and fries.  Everything was perfect.  Too bad it's 60 miles each way or we'd be there a couple times a month at least."}
{"text":"still amazing. i suggest getting a fried egg on whatever sandwich you get... i dont remember what i said in my last review as far as sides, but you need to get the beans. if you are really hungry you could probably deal with a second side, in which case i usually go with fries, but i'll leave that decision up to you. just promise me you will get the beans. they are after all the magical fruit. i love this place. every time i am in town i never leave without going here."}
{"text":"Umm Sunday breakfast at Bryans! Brisket hash, eggs, cornbread. Rustic, family friendly, great food, refreshing menu. Dog friendly patio, my dogs prefer the brisket. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, and really nice people too!  One of the best BBQ places in town and not a dump like some of the other good places too!"}
{"text":"Bryan's is a Very Nice Place !! It is in Cave Creek / Carefree and beautiful in the western town where it is located. The food is yummy and the prices are great !! If you have sometime to try this place I highlty recommend it !! :)"}
{"text":"A friend of mine had seen my glowing review of Little Miss BBQ in Phoenix and was begging me not to declare a state barbecue champion until I had tried her favorite joint in Cave Creek.  I love good barbecue so I agreed to at least come in with an open mind.  Long story short, Little Miss BBQ is still the best by far.  That said, there's plenty to like about Bryan's place and you'd probably come away pretty happy after making the drive to Cave Creek to try this place.

As with so much of Cave Creek, the ambiance and feel of the area is old western all the way.  A large prominently placed cactus greets you as you enter this old row of wooden buildings leading to the front entrance to Bryan's.  Inside the feel is very much that of a barbecue joint, though perhaps cleaner and more orderly with a hint of modern flare.  No waiter service here.  You order your food at the register, take a seat, and wait about 5-10 minutes for your named to be called to pick up your food at the counter.  The menu is prominently displayed as you wait in line as well as a daily special for those feeling more adventurous (the special dish today was smoked veal).  My friend raved about their pulled pork and I wanted to compare the brisket to Little Miss BBQ.  Solution:  The two meat plate.  Pulled pork, brisket, and a choice of two sides (I went with their beans and coleslaw).  To drink, I just got a water, but they actually have a very respectable selection of local and regional craft beers to choose from.  FYI, another reason my friend loves this place is because they have vegetarian barbecue items.  She LOVES their pulled squash sandwich, honey jalapeño watermelon, and their romaine lettuce with house made rub.

Total price for the food and a drink was just under $20.  One complaint about the food right off the bat is they serve their barbecue with the sauce already applied to the meats.  I'm someone who believes the best barbecue doesn't need sauce.  That said, Bryan's is very clear that they don't accept adaptations to their dishes.  So fine, I'll eat the meat with the sauce already applied.  The pulled pork was very good and plenty moist.  Brisket was smoky, though the meat was a tad dry for me.  The sauce was of the mild variety so it was a relatively subtle accompaniment to the meat, but there's was plenty on the meat to let you know it was there.  I was very impressed with the beans and the coleslaw.  Admittedly I love olives so the addition of olives into the coleslaw was a nice surprise.  The portions were such that I was satisfied, full, but not uncomfortably full.

Bottomline, its not Little Miss BBQ.  Not even close.  But if you're a fan of Phoenix barbecue institutions like Bobby Q or Pork on a Fork, this is pretty on par with those spots and possibly better on some dishes.  Very family friendly place too as there were plenty of parents with kids and the place was pretty busy overall.  If I were to come here again next time I'd probably go for one of their specials and see what smoked veal or whatever they're cooking up that day would taste like.  As for the traditional barbecue staples, good, though I've had better.  And Bryan if you're reading this, please hold the sauce next time."}
{"text":"This is by far the best BBQ I've had in the region. Everything they serve is fabulous. The portions are plenty. There is always something interesting for the daily special. The soda machine is even exemplary. I haven't tried the beer but the selection looks very interesting. The pulled squash is amazing as well as their special cole slaw. The food is great and the establishment is always clean. Bryans is my favorite spot for BBQ."}
{"text":"I think there is a lot of love going on behind that counter! This is the real deal, a great group of people who got together and decided that love should TASTE like BBQ! 
We found a BOGO coupon in the PHX Entertainment book and decided to give it a try since we're visiting here and we're already spending way more on dining out than we usually do at home. The line out the door to order was a tell-tale sign of what was to come....yum was to come!
There are rarely vegetarian options at a BBQ shack, but I did notice a \"pulled squash sandwich\" on the menu and that would have been a nice surprise if I was on one of my squeaky-clean-herbivore-days.....HOWEVER, I ordered the half slab that apparently came from a boar, from the size of those bones! But tender, oh so tender, and I added the sauce with a kick which was the perfect flavour for me. The hearty beans were awesome, too, as was the \"olive cole slaw\". My son wolfed down what he could of the ribs and pulled pork combo....he wasn't overly thrilled with the french fries, but everything else had great character. We each took just less than half home with us = great portions all around. 

** We visited Bryan's on 1/28/11"}
{"text":"We tried several things for lunch (brisket, pulled pork, chicken, chili, beans, mashed potato salad) because we were hoping to find our new go-to eating place. I liked the brisket but that's where the praise ends. Food tasted overly smokey and lacked seasoning. It was also a bit pricey but the portions were large. It's a cute place with lots of charm, everyone was friendly and we really wanted to like it. We might give it another chance in the future - just in case they were having an off day."}
{"text":"I've bookmarked this place quite a while ago, however hadn't made the time to go try their BBQ... Until this past weekend! And OMGoodness I've definitely been missing out!!! This little hidden away spot in Cave Creek is absolutely outstanding! 

The layout is a bit unorthodox, as I was truly expecting a sit-down, get waited on, kind of a BBQ place... but who cares?! The service is wonderful and the food is mouthwateringly amazing. When you pull up to the place, your stomach already starts growling since you can smell the BBQ as soon as you start walking up. Then you go on inside and up to the counter where the pleasant, and friendly employees take your order (and even help you decide/order if you've never been there before... like me). The melt-in-your-mouth meats and brisket selections are extensive, whether you like beef, pork, or chicken. And depending on how hungry you are, or if you get a platter, you get to pick two finger-licking good sides. Once you order, you wait (impatiently) for your food to come out, and wait for your name to be called. 

Being that it was my first time there, I went straight for the brisket... couldn't decide which meat I wanted -- beef or chicken -- so I figured why even chose? Why not have both?! So that's exactly what I did; and boy oh boy I was not disappointed. I also ordered some corn bread that was fresh and still warm, with melted butter... yum! It was so amazing because not only do I love warm yummy corn bread, but it also had a hint of smokey flavor to it, just like it would have been cooked over an open flame around a camp fire. 

After what felt like an eternity (but this was only because I was so hungry my stomach was beginning to digest itself and I was counting the seconds...), I finally heard my name being called! I jumped for joy and ran up to the counter to grab my brisket, potato salad, corn bread, baked beans, and coleslaw. (Umm yes, I WAS hungry!) I savored this amazing brisket (I prefer beef over the chicken), and all the sides were just wow -- so flavorful! Of course my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach, so I brought the rest home... and you know what that meant?! Yup! Amazing Bryan's BBQ at home the next day... woot woot!"}
{"text":"We were out hiking in Spur Cross today, and as we were heading out we noticed this new barbecue place.  

I read through quite a few of these reviews, and I think many are over critical.

Granted, this isn't barbecue that is going to win any world records, but we found it quite delightful.  Furthermore, the western setting was quite charming, and a nice addition to Cave Creek.

I wouldn't recommend that you drive across town for this fare, but if you happen to be in area, I do recommend you stop by.

We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I had the beef brisket sandwich and it was huge and kept me full for most of the day. The beans are great and had a spicy kick to them. There was so much brisket in the sandwich, they don't hold anything back. Good food for your buck. I would return."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty spare ribs that were very strongly smoked yet nearly falling off the bone. The pulled chicken was very moist and tender and basically had no seasoning other than the smoke flavor.

The roasted spaghetti squash, which is not listed on the wall menu but you can order it, was tender but really way too greasy and it lacked seasoning. 

The coleslaw was standard - average stuff and nothing to write home about even though it did have olives and others have waxed poetic about it. 

The baked beans were not sweet as we are used to but they did have a significant amount of flavor. The potato salad had grilled or smoky notes, can't remember exactly since it was not mine, but it was a cut above normal potato salads. 

The sleeper item of the night which I would go back and buy on their own were the sweet, pickled jalapeno peppers. You can cut those up into small pieces and add them to the lackluster squash or even to the coleslaw to jazz it up. They have the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. They give you one with your order and they were so good we went back and got a small side dish of them - six large peppers for $2.50 or so.

The place is fast casual, so you come in, order at the counter and then you wait for them to call your name. Did not see anyone else mention that in the reviews and with all of the four stars and five stars I was really expecting a sitdown place. Not having tableservice was a bit of a let down.

They also serve the food in those silly plastic boats that you see used at hotdog stands. Really? We are paying almost $20 for ribs and pulled meats and it's sitting on a thin sheet of waxed paper in a plastic hotdog tray? The juices from the sauce and the peppers make the paper fall apart and pretty soon your food is on that gross plastic directly. Not too cool. 

All in all it was good but having had eaten in other states with much better barbecue (and better packaging/plates on which it is served) I can only give it three stars for now."}
{"text":"I've been here three times.  To me it's the perfect lunch spot. The staff has always been friendly. The pulled pork and chicken are my favorite. The briskets has been a hit and miss. If you get here during the peak times, be prepared to wait in line."}
{"text":"I went to Cave Creek in service of some rustic furniture.  Though my shopping trip to did not net the piece of furniture I was looking for...I got that reminder from my stomach \"get something in my belly NoW!  So I resort to my trusty Yelp App - where to eat near me.  Bryan's on the GPS here I come.  The smell of the BBQ when I drove was mesmerizing.  So I walk in and place my order.  I opt for the Brisket sandwich w/ olive salad.  AMAZING and I loved my brisket sandwich. . The olive salad was interesting, I liked it but just a different slaw and it was very fresh tasting.  I think I want to try the potato salad & beans next time!  Will there be a next time? Absolutely!!!! This upcoming weekend for sure!

Place was very clean, friendly service and I enjoyed sitting outside watching the pedestrians and cars pass along.  One thing I am curious about is the Friday Frog Legs poster I read.  This sounds very interesting & my husband loves Frog Legs!  I haven't wrapped my mind around trying one until now....it's one of those things that if I didn't know what I was trying & then liked it...now tell me what I ate.  I just may try one for the time here.  Was trying to find pics of it here & none were on Yelp.... We will see if I ever meet up with Kermit....

If you are in Cave Creek - go to Bryan's!!!!! Enjoy & be awesome today!"}
{"text":"Spending the day in Cave Creek.  Come hungry for some bbq.  They have good portions and you'll leave satisfied. Lots of customers of all sorts. Love the Coca-Cola freestyle as well."}
{"text":"I was raised in Cave Creek and let me tell you this is the best food in town! Be sure to try the specials!!! There's always something fun and unique to try."}
{"text":"Great Barbeque and great service - they remember your name and move the usually busy line along. Try the lamb drumstick with the ginger beer barbeque sauce..Its seasonal but worth the wait every year."}
{"text":"We just ate at Bryan's. have to say it was the best BBQ we have had yet. We ordered the rib and meat combo. The ribs were smoked to perfection and very tender almost fall off the bone. The beef brisket was to die for so moist and tender and perfect smoke flavor. My Wife loved the coleslaw and I loved the fries. I would add a little sweetness to the beans but they were very good besides that. And they have the new soda machine with 100 plus combinations awesome. Worth the travel to try. If Bryan reads this would love if you added a smoked sausage to the menu and toasted the bread. Will definitely be back many times."}
{"text":"Good food in a very casual and comfortable environment. Really enjoyed the pulled pork and cowboy beans. Nothing fancy. Nothing prentenious about this place. You order at the counter and find a seat. The employees were helpful and friendly. Just wish the prices were a bit more reasonable and that they had more side options, such as a side salad. Overall, worth trying if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The chopped brisket sandwich is pretty good and I go every 2 weeks to get one and that corn bread OMG YUM, however my friends and I only get fries because the sides are not tasty at all, way too much mayonnaise in the potatoes salad and although I love olives they add them and it's not a good combo and the macaroni salad taste as if it came from a carton and pre made.  The beans are just ok.....Bryon I know you've heard this before from many patrons, change out your side dish recipes to have an excellent BBQ restaurant.  Don't be so stubborn by doubling down on cheap sides, their soooo unappealing."}
{"text":"Easily the best BBQ I've had here in Arizona. Fantastic smokey pulled pork! I will be back, no doubt about it."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Cave Creek and we were excited to find a BBQ joint.  Unfortunately, we were not impressed nor will we go back.  The pulled pork was in sauce that was way too sweet, the slaw was sweet and the potato salad was loaded with mayo.  The pork was not greasy or fatty, but you could not taste due to the sweet sweet flavor.  :-("}
{"text":"Bryan's is now my favorite place to eat in Cave Creek and has ignited a passion for bbq that I didn't know I had. 

I work relatively close so I've been going in about once or twice a week for the last 3 months or so. The owner and staff are awesome and the service is great. I'm absolutely in love with the beef brisket, the sauce is amazing, the meat moist, tender and the bun is lightly toasted which just tops everything off perfectly. The beans are my side of choice, they have this wonderful smokey, whiskey like flavor to them, the coleslaw is also pretty tasty. The pulled pork and ribs are also very good, with the chicken just slightly below both of them. 

Bryan is also a nice little selection of craft beer to go along with your bbq, such as Dogfish head and Deschutes brews, plus the standard fare of domestic beers."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ. I always get the pulled pork with hot sauce. Its a little pricey but that's the town of Cave Creek as a whole. And the reality is most of the Cave Creek places only do good business during the season. Think 6 -7 months of it being really slow. And places like Bryan's are really good. So its worth the extra cost."}
{"text":"We came by for dinner while we were staying at the Boulders.  The reviews were great, so we decided to check it out.  I enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich with baked potato salad on the side.  Relaxed, laid back vibe and friendly staff at the counter."}
{"text":"Bryan's was a disappointment last evening. In our previous (unreviewed) visit, the BBQ was excellent, so much we looked forward to a repeat experience this time.  Unfortunately, the food did not live up to our expectations.  We had brisket, chicken, and ribs, with beans, fries, and potato salad between the two of us. We also had a side of cornbread. The ribs were the best of the lot: tasty,  although not fall off the bones.  The chicken,  brisket and cornbread were dry and without character.  Both the beans and the potato salad were very good.  Overall, it was not a memorable meal.  We hope it was just an off night, or perhaps going latish on Sunday evening, the last day of their work week  (Bryan's is closed on Monday) should be avoided."}
{"text":"I can't believe I hadn't been to Bryan's until now, living in Cave Creek for so long! I'm not one of those people from KC or Texas that go seek out the best BBQ places around - so take my review with a grain of salt that I'm no BBQ expert with opinions on different sauces, etc.

Came here for lunch with two kids and everyone thought the food was really good. I had a plate with chicken and brisket because I'm not a big sandwich person. Everyone at our table loved the chicken the best I think - which is crazy! I tend to frequently get vegan meals, so I'm super excited to try the squash BBQ sandwich... since I love squash and it sounds fantastic from the other reviews.

Kids had pulled pork sandwich and ribs in the children's meals. Daughter didn't care for the ribs - but she's 9 and doesn't like blackened / charred food like every other kid. Other daughter had pulled pork sandwich and was in heaven! I really enjoyed the potato salad - rich with a strong fresh dill flavor. Cowboy beans weren't my favorite, and I love beans, but something about the flavor of cowboy beans doesn't do it for me. Contrary to the other reviews, I thought the fries were fantastic! They weren't soggy at all and very fresh - hard not to eat a lot of them. 

Genius are the Wiki Stick packs that they give to kids with children's menus! Never seen them before, and the kids had a good ol' time trying to form cowboys from the wiki sticks (instructions included). Wiki sticks are awesome, not messy, and different from the usual crayons and coloring paper thing - it shows that they actually put some thought into their smaller guests.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere, we'd visit again just for that.  However, the reviewers commenting on the lack of true bbq flavor are on the right side of this argument.  Thankfully they have good sauce to add on, because the inherent flavor of the pulled pork and brisket are nothing to write home about. 

The beans were delicious, while the chili was ok/good."}
{"text":"The pulled pork is phenomenal, and the Brisket is tasty as well. To top it all off, the staff is happy and friendly."}
{"text":"Great place! Hubby had the pulled pork sandwich with beans, I had the brisket with coleslaw, and daughter had the kid's sandwich with perfectly seasoned fries. Really good food. The pickled jalapeno they serve in the basket was delish. Next time we'll try the ribs. My only complaint is that they aren't open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Good food--I have always had the pulled pork sandwich--friends tried the brisket and liked it. Definitely one of the best places to eat in Cave Creek"}
{"text":"I suppose for uber touristy Cave Creek this place is very good.  By broader BBQ standards it's probably not up to world class snuff but the food isn't bad at all.  The briskit ribs and chicken were all good.  It's rather expensive but BBQ always is unless you're in some TX HITW.  The sauce is vinegary, which I think some confuse for ketchupy, but this is a style of sauce or wash that's more regional and more common to places back east in TN NC GA etc.  It's best to come off hrs to avoid crowds..  Ribs are pork but not back, they are spare.  I found them good and flavorful and the smoke flavor suspiciously acute.  By that I mean, I am wondering if they are helping it along with an additive because the flavor is that strong.  The sides are good, the potato salad being better than the beans or the slaw.  They are gracious hosts and do it right in that the all the acoutrement is readily available - sauces, wet wipes, refills etc.  Plus they serve BBQ on a sice of white bread while earns them an extra star in itself."}
{"text":"wow, what a great experience. Friendly staff, great ambience, and the best BBQ I've had in AZ. Caramel corn on the cob and pulled squash sandwich made our night."}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich was tender, smokey and served hot and fresh. Didn't need extra sauce but added some anyway. Fries were hot and tastey.. Employee at counter was super friendly . Can't wait to go back and try the other meats."}
{"text":"Just Finished eating this probably the best food in Cave Creek  the he food is excellent the quality is outstanding. But make sure you try the potato salad I usually don't like potato salad this is one of the best I have ever had. Tipping??? I tipped them but had no contact with anyone after I ordered I got my own food cleaned my table filled my drink not a big deal just odd. Price is in relation to the quality and flavor if you want cheap go to Taco Bell if you want to be amazed come here"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, atmosphere very casual..take out seemed a better idea..beef brisquet tender  great even without sauce, very well smoked"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Good BBQ. Loved the ribs, beans, Cole slaw & baked potato salad. Good sides. Very casual with some nice outdoor tables."}
{"text":"Good bye Bobby Q , So long Joe Johnston... I have found a new love...his name is Bryan.. and I love him.

A few months back Alexander told me to check this place out .. and I thought oh sure it's probably good. Boy was I wrong it's not good , it's fantastic!   

First, most BBQ joints that are any good are rinky dinky dives  that you try not to touch too many surfaces in ( you know its true!) 

But Bryan my new amore , is different his joint is well decorated, cute even , maybe whimsical. It has clean well lit, well thought out decorating,a large screen with old time westerns showing , nice touch,the place is clean  and in a tasteful strip mall. 

The food is ordered at the counter , we opted for ribs, shredded pork and brisket. The brisket was well cooked / smoked with meat falling apart as you cut into it.The sauce was tasty  but not over powering. No fake smoke taste or over top sugar taste here.  The ribs had a gorgeous pink smoke ring , lovely! Husband proclaimed the   shredded pork better than the ribs but he is wrong and not writing this review.  So there.   

Now here is the extra special touch .. the sides were really delish  no empty fillers here .. the beans are obviously slow cooked with care and dare I say ...love?   I even tasted a hint of beer which I  love in beans , they also had a rich taste that made them crave-able. 
The coleslaw was  a surprise as well , not only a great balance of taste not too sweet not too vinegary  but low and behold olives were hidden in there as well like little treasures just waiting to be uncovered.  Will I  be back ...oh yes ..Bryan and I plan to see each other at least a couple times a month . I think it's time for him to meet my folks.... I am looking forward to our kinda like a date night .   Can't wait to try him out again!  I mean try the food again .. Whatever I love Bryan."}
{"text":"Best brisket and ribs ever. Very generous portions. Great coleslaw and romaine salad. Good for Atkins diet just ask for sauce on side"}
{"text":"Bryan's Black Mountain Barbeque is definitely at the top of the Barbeque Mountain in the Phoenix metro area. They have plenty of seating both inside and outside the restaurant.

This place is busy and for good reason. You line up and give your order and pay. They also have many different types of sodas, tea and lemonade housed in a giant dispenser where you program what you want via touch screen. They call out your name when your order is ready. 

I really like the brisket and have enjoyed the ribs as well. They have a station where the heated BBQ Sauce is dispensed from a dispenser similar to how you get your ketchup. They season their fries with a lot of salt/spices so ask for plain fries if you're not into the salty/spicy fries. Their beans are also mighty tasty if you decide to go in that direction.

I just wish this place was a lot closer to my house because I love climbing that BBQ Mountain."}
{"text":"Solid place. Food is always good. Service is fast. Can't remember if patio is dog friendly or not; but it it should be. Great place for lunch. Good beer selection. Brisket always on point!"}
{"text":"Nice to have a local BBQ place in downtown Cave Creek. The food has a good smokey flavor....the cornbread was awesome."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, choice of sauces (smokey) and especially good potatoe salad - I think they roast the potatoes!"}
{"text":"The ribs and brisket we're all right nothing to brag about.. we did not care for the barbecue sauce and they put it on the ribs. I would've like to have put my own if any. Beans were horrible... let's just say, one bite was more than enough! Cole slaw was all right tasted fresh.. flavor was ok... had to do a little doctoring up. It is a nice clean atmosphere with friendly staff....
A huge no-no all wood tables inside are sticky yak"}
{"text":"Good brisket. Like the ribs and chili a lot. Pulled pork was dry (even with added sauce) and kind of tasteless. 

Cool atmosphere . Friendly vibe."}
{"text":"Ehhh it's ok bbq not the greatest worth trying if you like a dry rib . Nice place though good service"}
{"text":"Love Btyans. When my two sons come out from California they always want to go there. I eat their at least twice a month."}
{"text":"This place is bomb dot com I'm lucky enough to work and live close but don't let proximity deter you it's friggin worth it! Come check out some great food in quaint settings... don't miss out"}
{"text":"I have been sooo looking forward to Bryan's. (And he's really there, but he sure could work the guests - he needs to talk to the customers when he's not busy).  Today went for linner (3:30pm).  

Jo had the beef brisket plate - $14.95 with lots of beef and two sides.  The brisket, as in so many places, was dry.  WHY don't kitchens put their briskets in broth to keep them moist?  Cole slaw was ehh.  I had the Rib and pulled pork plate.  $14.95 with two sides.  5 nice, meaty ribs and a big pile of pulled pork.  But again, the pulled pork was very dry. And the chili was poor.  I used to cook chili in completion - made it to the final table in the CA State.  This chili....sorry, Bryan.  I would never order it again.

Tried both sauces.  The regular and the spicy.  Neither was to my taste, but no dings, because I know that BBQ sauce is really a personal taste thing.

So my final results....3 to 3.5.  Would I go back?  Maybe, but I'm going to try another place first."}
{"text":"We came out to Cave Creek looking for a place that was considered pet friendly and well reviewed. We stopped into Bryan's Black Mountain BBQ for a bite. It seems to be a pretty popular place so expect to wait a bit if you're here on Saturday. I got the 2 meat platter with the potato salad and cole slaw.

The good: the pulled pork was delicious. Tender, juicy, and smoky. The cole slaw was stand out too and has olives in it which added a little salty savory to it. If you don't like olives, your mileage may vary. 

The okay: the brisket was tender, but a bit dry and a little bland. The potato salad was pretty much supermarket tub quality. Edible, but not very interesting. 

Also sampled my wife's ribs and fries and those were very good. 

Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area, but there are plenty of other BBQ places in the valley at least this good."}
{"text":"We went to Bryan's today for lunch at noon. Hardly anyone there at that time concerned me but I ordered a half slab of pork ribs and my wife had the pulled pork sandwich. Both of us thought the BBQ sauce was very bland and tasted more like plain catsup. Fries were ok but not that special. My pork ribs did not look like they were cooked long enough and were very fatty. Wife's pulled pork was just ok but again not much taste in the BBQ sauce.
The restaurant is more of a cafeteria style eatery where you get in line and order and then pick it up after they call your name. Why not hire a couple of waitresses and make it a real restaurant?
The indoor seating was bland but I gave it one star because they did have an outdoor patio for eating.
I don't expect this place to be in business much longer."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ. Fair portions, but don't expect anything Texas huge. Orders are made and served at the counter. Not crazy about the side dishes. Nice setting in Cave Creek. Limited parking. Check for their closed days before you drive out to Bryan's."}
{"text":"The best bbq I have ever had, but oddly enough it was the olive coleslaw that stoled the show.  Bryan's is the best and Bryan was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Consistently great BBQ. Bryan's never disappoints us. Brisket, Pulled Pork and Ribs are our favorites. But don't miss out on Coleslaw and Beans. The Beans are killer!"}
{"text":"Close your eyes for a moment and imagine a wide rolling plain with tall grass and a gentle breeze. In the distance you hear the sound of  building thunder. There isn't a cloud in the sky but the thunder grows louder & the ground begins to tremble. The tranquil landscape around you is transformed as a massive herd of Bison rushes past in a terrifying blur of horns & hide. Now open your eyes and don't be afraid, BBQ has arrived in Cave Creek, Arizona!

Now I've had Bison several times before, though never the ribs, and have always found it to be a bit tough, chewy and somewhat gamey.  Having had the pleasure of several of Bryan's signature menu items previously, I jumped at the opportunity for a first taste.

On my arrival, I was greeted by Chef Dooley (generally behind the counter ready to carve to order), who came out and spoke to me about what his ideas of BBQ in general and this dish in particular are all about.  \"Simple, BOLD flavor,' is the Chef's mantra and the basis for everything they do.  Bringing the natural beefy flavor of  Bison to Bryan's BBQ just fits in with what they are doing in this well \"seasoned\" building where the theme is a modern interpretation of classic BBQ flavors.

Six piping hot ribs were set before me and I immediately noticed the deep pink ring imparted by smoking over Pecan wood.  A taste of the sweet Persimmon Glaze let me know what I was in for as I picked up a rib.  Upon taking my first bite, I immediately noticed how tender, lean and flavorful these ribs were, giving just the right amount of pull from the bone but not coming clean off. (Contrary to popular misconception, properly cooked ribs will not fall off the bone! The only ribs that fall off the bone are those that have been boiled and steamed. This process usually robs the ribs of flavor because water is a solvent. Steamed and boiled ribs usually have a mushy texture. Properly cooked ribs will pull cleanly off the bone with your teeth, but will still have some resilience and chew.)

Persimmons are a fruit that I have not had much experience eating/cooking with but the sweet, slightly tangy flavor worked quite well when rubbed with Bryan's mix of sage, juniper berries and a hint of black pepper.  The things that struck me most about this dish were how well balanced the flavors were and the natural \"beefiness\" of the meat.  My mind wandered back to that open, grassy plain and with each bite I could literally envision the massive heards of wild Bison that once roamed freely.

As a self professed BBQ fanatic and creator of a line of BBQ sauces and Dry spice rub, I tend to be much less forgiving in my opinion of what \"good BBQ' is.  Without reservation, I can tell you that Bryan's get's it right, Chef Bryan Dooley is passionate about BBQ! I happen to know that his hands touch every piece of meat that crosses the counter into a guest's waiting hands. Judging from the quality of this and the other menu items I've had personally, I can say that Chef Dooley's motto of \"simple, BOLD flavors\" has been superbly executed.

As a side note, since this item was not  available for purchase when I dined, Chef Dooley generously allowed me to try it free of charge.  This consideration in no way contributed to my opinion of this or any other dish served at Bryan's Black Mountain BBQ."}
{"text":"Probably more of 3.5 stars, but I am giving them the benefit of the doubt.

I had the pulled chicken sandwich, wife had squash.  My son had applesauce, ha!

The spicy sauce was better than the original, however both tasted like ketchup.  Maybe its just being in Chicago and having several really good BBQ joints so close that has spoiled me.  

Cowboy beans were good and flavorful, baked potato salad was ok and the fries need to lose the salt.

Beer offering is legit.

If we ever make it back to Cave Creek/Carefree we would stop in for lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great BBQ! Yes, you basically get your own food and clean your own table, but sitting outside enjoying the food and cold beer was really nice and relaxing. I must find the recipe for the amazing potato salad! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love Bryan's! 
Excellent food, atmosphere and great people. 
I'd say one of the CLEANEST restaurants around. There is always someone cleaning the dining area so you never have the chance of sitting at a dirty table. 
They are authentic and don't try to be something they're not. 
Counter service; order at the window and pick up your food when it's ready. 
Also, BEER"}
{"text":"Buttery, BBQ goodness! This is by far some of the best BBQ I've ever had and definitely in the top tier of best BBQ I've ever had in Arizona. It's been on my list to visit Bryan's, especially after reading so many Yelper's glowing reviews! Recently, I finally had the chance to try this divey BBQ shop and my mouth hasn't since stopped watering for a second, third and fourth visit! 

This is a no-frills BBQ restaurant filled with charm and aromas that excite any taste buds. It's exactly how a BBQ restaurant should be! We stood in line and watched (who I believe was) Bryan himself along with his co-chefs whip up delicious BBQ made-to-order. I decided to order the pulled pork BBQ sandwich while my husband went with the beef brisket topped with a fried egg (yes a fried egg! It's an add-on). The sandwich came with a side so I went for the fries. After we ordered and paid, we went to find a seat inside. They also have seating outside and plenty of cute shops to browse while you wait. 

Now on to the food! First of all, they have my favorite Coca Cola machine with about 50 different coke product options! I decided to sip on my favorite, the Diet Cherry Vanilla Coke that I can only find in these coke machines. We then filled plastic containers with piping hot BBQ sauce and dug in. The pulled pork is tender, juicy and full of flavor. Now I know what BBQ should taste like! The bun was buttery goodness and I didn't care one bit about the calories I was consuming with each butter-filled bite. The BBQ sauce was tangy and the perfect bit of sweet flavor to top the tender BBQ. I tried both the spicy and regular BBQ sauce and couldn't taste a different but loved the flavor of the sauce. I was also pleasantly surprised by the flavoring of the french fries and noticed a salty flavorful seasoning. I gobbled up every bite and happily entered a food coma. I will be coming back often and also plan on picking some up for takeout. They would be a great place to get a party catered as well!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue! We had the pulled pork that was tender and tasty. Our friend went for half rack of pork ribs and he said they were perfect. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I wish there was a rating between 2 and 3 stars.  We're originally from Kansas City, so it's very difficult to be fair when reviewing BBQ restaurants anywhere else. (KC is well known for their extraordinarily delicious BBQ.) We had Brisket sandwiches, fries and the beans.  Must say, Brisket was moist and well smoked - although a bit \"fatty\" for our taste.  Flavor of the meat was good.  Fries were fine.  Beans....well....they were terrible.  Our kids had the ribs - 10 yr old daughter liked them, 15 year old son........mmmmm.....not so much.  The 2 sauces (mild or spicy) were barely more \"BBQ-y\"  than ketchup - YUCK!  Restaurant was very clean and pretty busy for a Friday evening.  We won't be going back.  (I guess we'll continue our search - in vain - to find a more KC style BBQ restaurant here in the Phoenix area.)"}
{"text":"Over the river and through the woods.. lalalala, la, la.. Cave Creek, AZ is kind of a drive but I suppose no worse than driving to Gilbert from Scottsdale. Though this journey includes cactus, multi-million dollar mansions and the occasional coyote rather than tract homes and freeway. Once you get out there the entire area is sort of like old cowboy rustic charm. So doesn't it makes sense to open a BBQ joint way out in the middle of somewhere? The owners of Bryan's sure did!

Only being open just over a month, Bryan's was hopping busy and there is a reason why.. the smell. You can just about taste the pecan smoke as you pass by or pull up. Its an enticing fragrance that grips, strokes and pulls you in to see what's about that hopefully delicious smokey goodness. 

Once inside you'll easily tell where you need to go.. it's all about counter service here. The menu is easy to navigate as its short and sweet. Its a greatest hits of BBQ and you'll be hard pressed just to order one thing. Go ahead, order as much as you like, loosen your pants and stay a while. 

Ordering for us was pretty easy though we did cross section the menu, pork ribs, pulled pork sandwich, beef brisket, olive cole slaw, baked potato salad and cowboy beans. Get your drinks then grab a seat in the modern, cowboy space. They do serve beer as well as Coke products though I noticed something strange, most people were drinking water. Is that how they are dealing with the economy? Spend a little on food and cut a couple of bucks on the beverages? Good idea I suppose, coke is coke is coke, right? Water cleanses the palette and pairs with anything, sure Ill go with it! 

Okay, they called the Mr.'s name, my mouth is watering, my sauces are ready, good to go! First bite, the brisket, smokey, juicy and perfectly tender, the white bread under the brisket soaks up the meat juices, good idea, why didn't I think of that?! Next, ribs, oh no.. I can suck the meat right off the bone? Its not like I can suck a golf ball through a garden hose (well, Ive never tried)  it's just that the ribs are that tender! Dip in a bit of the spicy sauce, hellish good (I don't think they serve BBQ in heaven right? Smoke and flame thing, eh?)! Pulled pork sandwich, is melt on your tongue tender, I can see why so many older folks were ordering these sammies, no teeth required. 

Oddly the sides are in need of some tweaking. The baked potato salad was on the dry side but I have yet to have a baked potato salad that I like. Something about cold baked potatoes that don't do it for me. The cowboy beans had no real character and were only one flavor, a smokey sweetness that was good on the first bite but lacked depth. The olive cole slaw was different and while the Mr loved it, I'm just not a fan. However each plate was served with a bread and butter jalapeno, not only clever but addictivly delicious. 

Oh the desserts, simple and satisfying. Homemade Ice Cream Sandwich and a Sarsaparilla Float. We got the ice cream sammie which was 2 huge chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream. Nice crunch factor on the cookie with the cold smoothness of the ice cream, talk about a happy ending. 

On the way out the sun was setting the moon was rising and all seemed right in the world. Perhaps for the first time in ages, a calm swept over me and all I could smell was pecan smoke begging me to come back some time soon.  

Oh yeah, me and my O-face!"}
{"text":"What a treat to find this place.  Wife and I were hungry after finishing a round of golf and found this great place.  Brisket was moist and flavorful with just the right smokey taste.  Also tried the pulled pork, pork ribs and chicken....delicious!!  Being from Texas I didn't think you could find bbq this good outside the Great State.......I was wrong!"}
{"text":"Hubby ordered the two item plate ($14.95) of pulled pork and chicken. The plate includes two sides; he chose brisket chili and olive coleslaw. The pork and chicken were moist and lightly sauced. 

I ordered a rack of pork ribs (hubby always ends up eating half) ($24) with baked potato salad and olive coleslaw. The ribs were prepared far better than many I have had since Martin's in Nashville TN (Guy Fiera's restaurant in Las Vegas should take note of Bryan's).

The potato salad is tasty and olive coleslaw has a unique flavor. The olive taste is there but not overdone. The chili made from the barbecue is a different take on traditional chili. Do not confuse Bryan's barbecue with southern barbecue - there is a definite difference but it tastes good.

The barbecue sauce comes in regular and spicy. In addition to the sauce served on the meat are heated pump dispensers by the utensil station.

We have eaten lunch in many restaurants in Cave Creek. For us it is a pleasant drive on the weekend. Bryan's is the first restaurant that we will return to."}
{"text":"In spite of the numerous quality food options in the greater Phoenix area, unfortunately, Bar-B-Que is not one of them. However, Bryan's starts to change the game by offering quality bar-b-que. They do not offer table service, so you line up to place your order. I went with the brisket sandwich. The neat was tender and the sauce was a little sweet but not too much. Try the best bar-b-que west of Texas."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a really good lunch here- brisket sandwich and pork ribs were moist and flavorful. The staff was extremely friendly and took our picture by the touristy pig near the front door as we were leaving. The sides are made in house and I would really recommend the beans and potato salad."}
{"text":"I am only giving this place two stars instead of one because the music was good and the brisket was tender. Other than that this place is totally overrated.
They use lines instead of servers and on a Friday night we had to wait almost an hour to order. It took almost another hour to get our food. They have a side section that only will serve you soft drinks and beer. That side section would've been great to handle overflow but the lady at the counter said that wasn't allowed.

Corn Bread was dry and the barbecue lacked  any distinguishable flavor. It was a overpriced but I guess that's par for the course for Cavecreek. They lost a ton of business from people that just walked out because they were tired of waiting.

If you are going to try this place, don't do it on a Friday night.

~Jim"}
{"text":"Yum...Yum...Yum...  My boyfriend and I have been searching for good BBQ for a while here in Arizona and he found this place and took me last night and it did not disappoint!  Good pulled pork, the baked potato salad was great and prices are very reasonable!  Cool vibe, small place, very Cave Creek inspired."}
{"text":"The. most. wonderful. brisket! Smoky and tender -- it's my favorite thing on their menu. Normally, I'm more of a pulled pork BBQ kinda girl but this brisket has converted me. The potato salad is rich and packed with dill and the coleslaw is refreshing with big pieces of olive (so beware, if you don't like them). Interesting bottled beer selection at fair prices. 

Destination-worthy BBQ!"}
{"text":"I haven't made the drive up in a while, but have had some good friends shuttle me provisions from here. 

This stuff is really good, even reheated after refrigeration!
Pulled pork still my fave, but I won't say no to anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"THE BEST Tomato Sandwich on planet earth! We get that to share and then each get an entree! I love the Pulled Pork Salad and my husband and daughters always get the Brisket Sandwich! This is an amazing dining experience! Be sure to try ALL of the sides! They are all fantastic."}
{"text":"Bryans barbecue has a very good pulled
Pork and a very tasty brisket, but I'd
Stay away from the ribs. They definitely weren't fall-off-the-bone type ribs. If you like spice, the spicy BBQ sauce was a kick in the ribs. 
The sides were not The best I've ever had, with the potato salad lacking flavor and the slaw being vinegar-based.the cornbread was ok, but it isn't considered a side, so it costs extra.
All In all, a decent meal, but in my opinion, not on the top of the barbecue list. I'd rather drive a half an hour to BobbyQ for an out-of-this-world BBQ experience."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.

My wife and I love BBQ and we can always find something on the menu here.  My only warning is that it's very easy to over-consume.

They have both a sweet and spicy BBQ sauce.  I love the sweet and my wife love's the spicy.

I don't care for olives so I skip the slaw side and almost always go with the beans.  They tend to be just a tiny bit spicy with nice chunks of meat mixed in.

The pulled-pork is probably my favorite but I often get the pulled-chicken sandwich as well.  My only complaint about the chicken is easily remedied by adding BBQ sauce.  I think the chicken would be a little better if it came with a little more sauce on it or was a little juicer.

The pricing is a little higher than I would expect for a run-of-the-mill BBQ joint but, then again, it's not just a run-of-the-mill joint.

My wife and I try to get in there about once a week."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here once a month when the budget permits us.  Having grown up in a BBQ Restaurant in Alabama I must say this is the best BBQ West of the Mississippi!  I personally enjoy the 1/3 rack of ribs with Brisket and 2 sides. I have never been a fan of potato salad, that being said Bryan's has the most amazing potato salad I have ever had!!  The BBQ beans are also very good and a little spicy.  The best side choice for me is the Slaw!!  Ribs are always smoked to perfection here.  When we place our order we make sure to place a TOGO as well (usually always chopped brisket, 1lb.)  The prices for food are well worth it! The drive is definitely worth it! Knowing that I'll be back for more... Worth it every time!!"}
{"text":"...described as St. Louis BBQ meets Kansas City BBQ. I don't know but I do know this stuff is TASTY!!! Maybe the best BBQ in the Phoenix area. I had the beef brisket sandwich with their Jalapeno BBQ sauce and potato salad and the mouth watering smoked Jalapeno 'muy caliente'!

They are closed on Sunday and Monday so you will have to wait until Tuesday to try it for yourself and agree this is THE BEST BBQ in town.

Oh but wait...they have a great beer selection too. I happened to have a Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA. Highly recommended with the Beef Brisket sammy!"}
{"text":"Bryans... I have heard good things about you. 

What I liked.. 
Seating: Take yer pick in or out. 
Decor: Loved it
Service: They were attentive
Bun: Toasted

What I didn't think worked...
Price: 13 for a pulled pork and a side of brisket chili
Brisket Chili: tasted of chili spice no real flavor here.
The sauce: thin watery limited choices with nothing real spicy. 
Pork: sauced before you get the sandwich.

With that being said.. the first few bites of the sandwich were disappointing but as I endured the flavor of the pork and the subtle taste of sauce played well together and I found myself wishing I had more with each bite. I really liked the toasted bun as it gave a slight burnt flavor on the outside edges. 

I doubt I would go back just for lunch/dinner,  with so many other choices near me but if I were in the area I would be sure to stop in."}
{"text":"I'm a Texas Transplant.  For the last year I've been looking for BBQ that would be as good as back home.  That's a tall order considering that Texas is the Cradle of Civilization where BBQ is concerned.  I'm religious about my smoke and have eaten at some of the finest BBQ places around.  But Phoenix disappointed me.  It seemed as though nothing here was worth the brown paper it was wrapped in - UNTIL I WENT TO BRYAN'S!

The food here is fresh, tender, tasty, and prepared with care.  The sauce is very nice and well balanced.  The chopped beef was gristle free. the brisket had a nice smoke ring in it. The sides were unique and different.  The food can't be beat.  It easily competes with the Top 10 joints back in Texas.

Service and hospitality?  YEP! They have that covered too! Just like back home they were very nice and happy to have you.  We felt like family.

I'll mention decor and atmosphere even though it isn't high on my list.  It is a nice little hidden place right on the main drag in Cave Creek.  I love sitting out on the patio and drinking beer.  It is a fun place to slow down and watch the world go by.

I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try Bryan's BM BBQ since we've heard so much about it and have had poor luck in finding good eats in Cave Creek.  

It was an awesome day so we sat out side on their patio, which is what I would recommend.  You have to wait inline at a counter to order your food, which I'm OK with providing the line moves quickly.  Unfortunately we were behind some \"lookie loos\" that have never eaten BBQ before and had to have everything explained to them in detail...  IT'S BBQ, nothing fancy so order and move it! 

I had ribs with baked beans and coleslaw.  Ribs were very good but had a bit too much sauce on them.  The beans were delicious and the coleslaw was terrible due to the olives and it was too dry.  I love olives but not in coleslaw!

My bride and son had pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad and fries.  The pulled pork was very good as were the fries however their potato salad had way too much dill. It was more of a \"dill salad\" with a little bit of potato. 

We finished with fried apples with cinnamon, pepper corns and a dusting of sugar.  Sounded great but found it too greasy to eat.

Their ribs and pulled pork were good enough to leave you wanting more.  

We are looking forward to our next visit to Bryan's so we can try their brisket, chicken and veggie style pulled squash! I recommend Bryan's to my friends, so stop by next time your in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"FYI. Got the craving for their delicious heirloom tomato sandwich but decided to call ahead. Glad I did summer hours say not open today, Sunday even though yelp says they are...postpone tomato sandwich till Tuesday."}
{"text":"Just love this place although we find the menu somewhat limited. The best pretzels and beer cheese dip in town! Great atmosphere with good service and hands on owners. Everything served fresh and piping hot. Burgers are great and fried shrimp addictive. Well worth a visit to sip a cocktail with friendly bar tenders."}
{"text":"Amaaaazing BBQ! Best pulled pork I've ever had in my life . Fast service, polite staff, great sides."}
{"text":"I am a certified KCBS judge. I have eaten all kinds of BBQ all over the world. I can assure you this place is the best and most consistent I have found. No matter where you live it's worth the drive. Bryan over sees each order and it must meet his ok before being served. Brisket it better than competition 
Cooking. Ribs are great pulled pork also. Always some specials like lamb.chicken etc, sauces are great an warmed. I'm hungery"}
{"text":"Ever since El Paso closed down I have been looking for ribs I like as well.  I found them!  

I was surprised the place was as quiet as it was early on a Saturday evening.  I was informed by my date that Cave Creek businesses suffer in the summer as many folks willing to drive that far out of Phoenix will drive the extra hour to Prescott and the cooler temps.

I had the ribs and my date had the brisket and we both chose beans and cole slaw.  She really liked the brisket but I thought it was a bit dry and we both needed to use sauce on it.  We really loved the ribs and beans! The cole slaw seemed a bit flat in taste but I think it would have been hard to stand up against the bold flavors of the rest of the dinner, in any case it was certainly fresh and had no off flavors.

Be careful of the iced tea machine.  The 3 labels are: unsweetened black, Sweet tea and Green tea.  We both made the assumption the green tea would be unsweetened only to find out it was very sweet.

The counter service was pleasant.  The place was clean.  The only restrooms were in an outside walkway and served the entire building.  I was surprised they close at 8 on the weekends.  I would like to go back in cooler weather and set out on the patio."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, had the brisket sandwich with slaw. All tasted very good, but I will have the slaw on the side next time only because the slaw juices made their way to the bottom bun. Good BBQ flavor and extremely friendly service. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the fantastic restaurants in Cave Creek. Bryan put together a menu that is simple & delicious, with just a touch of unique, from cole slaw with olives to a sweet & spicy sauce. And the smoked meat? Well, THAT's why you need to eat here. It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"A friend brought us up here to Bryan's because he thinks its the best bbq in the valley.   We had a hard time finding parking.  When you go in, you stand in line and walk up to the counter to order and return when your food is ready.  There is minimal inside seating, but lots of outdoor seating. 

I had the brisket and M had the pulled pork (his fave at any bbq place).  We also shared some fries.  Everything tasted pretty good.  M didn't really care for the coleslaw.  The bbq sauce was tasty with just the right balance of smokey/sweet/spice.  

The staff was friendly enough.  They did keep the place clean.  They also have a nice selection of fountain drinks and bottled beer.  We would come up here again if we were near the area."}
{"text":"We came from the Central Coast of CA in 2007 where they have real oak pit BBQ.   Santa Maria style BBQ.  On the streets, in shopping centers, fundraisers for sports, etc you get the best food.  Arizona has nothing like it, so we have been searching for the best bbq in AZ.  We have eaten many places and felt ripped off both by tase and money wise.

Bryan's is the closest we could find to perfect.  We couldn't find bbq chicken here in AZ, still on the bone, not shredded.  Bryan's came through for us. It is so tender and juicy, you will just woof down the whole 1/2 chicken in no time! The sliced brisket is tender and juicy, the ribs tender and juicy, the 1/2 chicken on the bone is soooo juicy.  The fries are absolutely to die for, but the other sides are too, especially the sour cream potato salad and rib salad.
  
The ribs... (it is a salad-- not rib meat) is the perfect salad to share, romaine spears with a great dressing easy to pick up and eat with your meal, but we needed a smaller size option, as we were pigs and ate all of our meal, too.  

If you are looking for a certain soft drink, their coke machine must have at least 500 choices, sugared, no sugar and no caffeine varieties abound--and I have a hard time finding something besides water with no sugar and no caffeine at many places.

All in all, we tell everyone about Bryan's, we drive from Prescott Valley to have BBQ as often as we can. My birthday is coming up soon and I am having Mario take me here for fantastic food.   BIG FOOD, you will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Excellent bar b que at good prices. Nice western atmosphere and friendly staff. It's our go to place for bar b que every time especially with out if town visitors. I love the pulled chicken and my husband loves the brisket or ribs and also the chilli and cornbread."}
{"text":"This is a good three star barbecue restaurant. It is a self-service restaurant. You order at the counter and they call out your order when it is ready. You pick up your order and carry it to your table. I ordered the two meat plate with two sides. The brisket was nice and moist but so moist that it tasted washed out. Shredded chicken was well prepared, not dry, and tasted much better when dipped in spicy barbecue sauce. Potato salad was rich, flavorful and the potatoes were cooked just right. Chili was nicely spicy and full of meat. The cornbread was the best. I should have ordered a plate of cornbread and chili. I think I will give Bryan's Black Mountain Barbecue another try next time I am in Cave Creek, AZ."}
{"text":"Hands down Bryan's has the best BBQ in Arizona and maybe even Texas.  The brisket was smoked perfectly and very moist and tender.  The Baked Potato Salad and Olive Coleslaw are wonderful and I love the Bread and Butter Jalapeno's.  I recommend Bryan's to the customers I meet at the Antique Emporium.  Today I heard from two customers how wonderful his Tomato Sandwiches are.  I cannot wait to try one!  Bryan you rock!"}
{"text":"I had a terrific pulled chicken sandwich and sliced up the jalapenos provided with every dish and it was sensational. The frenchfries and cowboy beans are my go-to sides. Delicious."}
{"text":"Quick serve, delicious bbq. Lamb shank bbq'd? Yes, it was awesome. Potato salad was very different and delicious. Try this joint, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Bryan's BBQ is a staple in cave creek! Honestly the best bbq you will probably find in az. I love the pulled pork and my family always gets the beef brisket. They also have chicken and spaghetti squash for vegetarians. Everything has a perfect smoky flavor with a vinegar based bbq sauce. Sides are great as well! I really love the coleslaw with green olives and baked potato salad with fresh dill and sour cream!"}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's memorial for which Bryan's BBQ graciously provided the food.  We had a few choices of different kinds of BBQ along with the sides.  The meal was good and the BBQ was SO delicious!!  The service was great as well.  It was the perfect place for a memorial send off.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best barbecue in the valley! I have been here many times and usually order the pulled pork sandwich. The meat is so flavorful, tender, and delicious; Bryan's has the best barbecue I've ever had. My boyfriend always gets their ribs which are just as amazing. This is our favorite place to go and worth the drive! Portions are big and prices aren't too bad, it's what you would expect in the Cave Creek/North Scottsdale area. The only downsides are the hours (closes at 8 and is closed all day on Monday and Sunday!) and that this is the only location. I wish another Bryan's could open up somewhere further south!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue.   Really great!  And sides are good. Order two beers up front. Share the ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"Bryans is a dependable barbecue destination in Cave Creek.  The brisket is delicious and the corn bread is addictive.  Some interesting specials.  We especially like the coleslaw.  Both indoor and outdoor seating.  Lots of parking, which is nice during the season."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place after a trail ride at Cave Creek. Great outside sitting areas. Food was also very good. The brisket was the best item we tried. The beans were also top notch"}
{"text":"Solid BBQ joint in quaint Cave Creek! Clean, small, fun atmosphere with live music. Food was really good and did not disappoint. We had ribs, brisket, chicken, fries, potato salad, beans and watermelon. Potato salad is the bomb, YUM if you like dill!!Chicken was incredibly moist, brisket was juicy, and the pulled pork was delicious! Beans and coleslaw were okay, but a little on the bland side. Great craft beer selection too! We will be back for BBQ!"}
{"text":"I can't withhold stars any longer. The meats are all delicious. Food and service VERY consistently top-notch. They even changed the fries so they're perfectly crisp. Favorite restaurant in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding. It smells like a campfire and tastes amazing. Even their fries are something awesome.

The only reason I can't give Bryan's 5 stars is because their prices are a bit higher than they really should be. I mean, really, they are quite high.

Another personal complaint is that they really have a bad location, I love going to Bryan's but I don't love the 40 minute drive. I would really like to see another location opened somewhere nearer to Phoenix proper.

But if you're into good BBQ and on a quest for the best. this is just one of those places you need to try. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"We went to Bryan's over the weekend and were very happy we made that choice.  The place was hopping; very busy with customers.  The line moved fast.  We ordered the pulled chicken and pulled pork sandwich.  We both decided on the coleslaw as our side.  Very tasty and succulent.  The BBQ sauce is mild and does not overwhelm the meats.  The olive coleslaw was good and not too heavy on the olives.  I would have liked a stronger taste.  We sat outside and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"YUM! Heard about this BBQ from Twitter (@bryansbbq) via @desertsmokebbq. Took the lovely drive up to Cave Creek to check it out. I had never been to Cave Creek before, so I was hoping the 40 mile drive for dinner would be worth it. I was definitely pleased! We ordered The Big Pig as an appetizer (fries smothered in pulled pork, beans, chilies, and sour cream) as well as the habanero chicken for my boyfriend and the pulled pork sandwich for me. We never touched our entrees as The Big Pig was HUGE and so tasty. I had the pork sandwich the next day for lunch and loved the smokey flavor. I plan to eat there again in the future! Thanks to Bryan and his staff for a great couple of meals!"}
{"text":"My parents have been coming here weekly for 7 years. We often had family events here in large groups. After the passing of my father last weekend, we knew there was no place else to celebrate his life. Bryan, and the sweet women working that day, made our celebration absolutely perfect. Thank you so much, Bryan's BBQ."}
{"text":"I've dinned here many times since they opened and it never disappoints. The ribs are amazing, the sides are delicious, and the western decor is unique."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good.  Had the BBQ Brisket and Chicken combo.  Great atmosphere too.  We've also ordered off the catering menu for a party and it tasted great and easy to serve.  Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time after an Oregano's debacle only to see there was a long line. We stuck it out since everybody was raving about the place.

We waited in line 30mins and got our food 15mins after we ordered. It was SO worth it!! Wow!! 

Not only were the ribs and brisket good, the coke slaw is mixed with kalamata olives that gives it a good and different taste.

The customer service by the lady that took out order was very pleasant to see on a busy night . 

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Aaaand I have a new favorite pulled pork sandwich!  So amazingly good! 
Great music, great location, great space & phenomenal BBQ.  

Definitely get an ice cream sandwich!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I have been to a few bbq joints in Texas and will say this place has them all beat love it."}
{"text":"It's not summer until you have the tomato sandwich. Something so simple yet so delicious. My favorite side is the potato salad. Always great service and very comfortable atmosphere. Have to put on calendar now before tomato sandwich is gone (although BBQ is also very good)"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ! My wife and I come here almost every week. Have had almost everything on the menu. Everything is on point! I'm trying something new this time : frog legs (only available on Friday) I'll let you know how it was. :)"}
{"text":"The secret is out... 
Everyone knows that this is the best BBQ in cave creek - maybe Arizona - possible the U.S...  We have seen this place grow since the day that they open and I think is because they are consistent with the quality of their product. Its good and it's good every time.."}
{"text":"Our first trip to Cave Creek we decided on Bryans since a local business owner recommended them.  It was great!  As you walk in you can certainly tell this is a REAL BBQ place.  The aroma of the smoky BBQ envelops your senses.  It only gets better from there.  We dined in with our pulled pork, coleslaw and a cold Bryans' Wheat beer.  Every bite and sip was perfect. Not only is the meat roasted to perfect tenderness it is seasoned well and complemented by the perfect amount of BBQ sauce.  I am saying perfect too often? Probably, so I will finish with \"too perfect\" and not to be missed."}
{"text":"The food is beyond good here....always fresh, perfectly seasoned and cooked. It's always clean even at the height of the busy time.  Only two draw backs are is that it's slightly pricey and there needs to be more choices of side dishes.  Other than that it's a fabulous little place and worth the drive from anywhere."}
{"text":"Living on past glory. The BBQ sauce is served hot because the meat is served cold. It's barbequed then refrigerated and reheated at the line so who knows how old the meat is. When my wife complained she was reserved chewy meat with that slimy texture you get from a microwave.  My ribs were luke warm and with meat so tough you had to chew on them like a dog to get it off the still cold bone. Even the potato salad had under cooked potatoes. The best and only hot portion of our meals were the baked beans and french fries. We ate all of those and threw well over half the meal away. YES we did go somewhere else afterwards to get decent food."}
{"text":"not sure why all the ranting and raving. this was one of the worst BBQ places I've eaten. looked promising going in, but food was horrible. to be specific if u like the whitest white meat chicken with a smear of nonengaging BBQ sauce, this is for u."}
{"text":"Being from Texas, it's hard to find good and satisfying BBQ. Bryan's BBQ is the real deal - great pulled pork sandwiches and brisket. It's worth the drive to Cave Creek for Bryan's."}
{"text":"We have been hearing about Bryan's for years. A friend who has been there told us it was nothing to write home about, and that she wouldn't go back. We decided to try it  today, but we won't go back. The 1/2 chicken was lukewarm, at best, and the cole slaw with olives needed seasoning.  What should have been the \"star\", the BBQ sauce, was almost non existent, and really had no flavor to speak of. We expected an out of this world experience, but it just didn't deliver. The fries were the best part of the plate. For three, lunch was $53.  We've had better BBQ at Dillon's and when the mood strikes for it, that's where we'll go."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times now and usually order the chicken brisket or ribs, all that are delightful.I was here about a yr. ago and ordered the squash sandwich and was very impressed so, that paired with the fact that I am trying to eat better inspired my menu choices for this evening. They we're the tomato sandwich  Romaine fries & watermelon dressed with honey.It was spectacular ! I had doubts that ordering vegetarian at a barbecue joint could backfire on me But, it did not.If I could give the tomato sandwich 10 stars I would.Strips of romaine lettuce topped with an Italian dressing and lemon-superb.Watermelon was refreshing and sweet.Kuttos Bryan's for adding theses healthier options and making them very tasty too!"}
{"text":"Staff very friendly , split the half chicken dinner which was pretty good Skin could have been a little more crispy , baked potato salad awesome as were the fries and bot BBQ sauce s , will be back to try something different , for visitors you'll have to pay attention while driving it's a little hard to find"}
{"text":"Yes, the only barbecue place within twenty miles is going to be a huge draw, but this is very average food with a barbecue sauce that falls very flat.  The sides are nothing special either, but it is the only game in town. If you want to go into Phoenix, there are many places that are much better than this.  The place is nice, service is good, but the beer could be colder for sure.  I would make the trip into Tempe or Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love Bryan's BBQ. The food is fabulous. If there is anything I'd change its the atmosphere. I'd like it to be a little more quiet. The floors at concrete and the surroundings a little stark. Could be more upscale. Food is the best and the people are better. It's a great place and I go there often."}
{"text":"I would actually rate Bryan's 4.5 stars.  In terms of Phoenix-area BBQ, this is the best we've found, and whenever we take a trip up to Cave Creek to either shop or visit friends, we MUST eat at Bryan's.  I dig the sauce.  The chili is fantastic.  Ribs are top-notch--and, amazingly, even taste phenomenal 1-2 days later after popping them in the microwave.  I could probably live the rest of my life on their pulled pork.  We make sure to arrive when they first open to avoid a long, long line.  Popular for a good reason--the owners (a Texan and a Chicagoan--how can you go wrong with that?) deserve all their great marks and popularity.  Why not 5 stars?  The places I would give 5 stars in AZ and, especially, in KS and TX, usually have a bit of a wider menu selection--including the sausages that have been mentioned in other reviews.  If the owners do expand their menu, I may be driving out here every other week!"}
{"text":"Ok, I've been to a lot of BBQ outside the South and this is by far the Best of the West.  This is a family owned place that looks like they had a decorator spend millions.  Now for the food, WOW.  I highly suggest getting the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw on top and potato salad on the side.  The pulled pork is so tender and juicy it literally melts in your mouth the bun it's served on is the best bun I have ever had now beating out the long time favorite Inn-N-Out.  I can't wait to go back their next weekend to my parents coming from California...what a treat they're in for.  My wife had the pulled pork as well, but had french fries on the side and they were seasoned to perfection.  This is our BBQ place of choice here in Arizona.  Will be trying the babyback ribs next time we come and my wife is super picky about her ribs, so I will have to post a follow-up review."}
{"text":"Great, if not the best BBQ in the Valley.  We've been 20 times, easily.  I can't pick a favorite - pulled pork, ribs etc.  Good beer selection, too.  I love the Potatoe Salad side; I just wish for me dessert choices - maybe a good old-fashioned homemade apple dumpling, or fruit cobbler.  I agree with the other comments, that some seasonal sides might shake up the menu for us regulars.

Good:  Nice friendly atmosphere, casual, nice crowd.

One concern:  Being in tune with the environment, and recycling, I am surprised by the use of styrofoam cups and containers (Containers I more understand, due to heat; and keeping the food temperature consistent.), but there are some really good biodegradable beverage cups made from corn.  Same goes for the \"side dishes\" to be consumed on site."}
{"text":"Tried Bryan's based on reviews I read. Their famous 
Cole slaw tasted sour.  Beans were nothing special. Ribs were over cooked and hard to chew. Bbq sauce was awful and staff friendliness was totally not there.  Forgetaboutit!   Richie rich fountain hills"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. Got the pulled chicken and it wasn't what I was expecting. The chicken was moist and pretty chunky. Hands down the best pulled chicken sandwich I have ever had. Went here based on other Yelp reviews and I am so glad I did."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to visit this place and was very happy that I did.  Not only did the food smell, look, and taste great, but the whole staff actually seemed like they enjoyed their jobs and wanted to be there.   Bryan walked around to chat with people, and seemed very personable.  
There is no table side service,  and the eating area is fairly small, but friendly.   
If you like good barbeque, this should be a must try place.  You will not be disappointed.  Also, as a side note, barbeque is messy and the extra large cleanup wetnaps are a very nice touch.  
Thanks"}
{"text":"Great food and good service at a reasonable price. I thought that the Carmel Corn on The Cob would be gross, but it was amazing. These guys have unique offerings that might seem odd, but really taste awesome. Dine with confidence, this restaurant is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years, and every visit has been spot on!  The service is very friendly and the restaurant is extremely clean.  I am a vegetarian and it is the only BBQ restaurant I have been to that has a vegetarian option.  A \"pulled\" squash sandwich is offered year round; in the winter, they typically have a fried artichoke po'boy that is killer.  My friends love the BBQ meat."}
{"text":"The BBQ is above average. However, after waiting about 45 minutes, I learned that they had given my order to someone else. No one came out to apologize, which is what I would have expected."}
{"text":"Really happy with this place. So glad they can serve great quality meat and not just douse it with BBQ sauce. 

Came here with the inlaws and we all loved it. No fat on any of our meat yet tasted perfectly moist."}
{"text":"Good bbq. Nice vinegar hit to the sauce. Nice in and an outside patio. Prices are decent for Cave Creek.

It got a four only because there are two places closer to me in Phoenix that have 5 Star bbq."}
{"text":"Not impressed. 

We drove quite a ways to see if this place was worthy of all the praise it had shown here on Yelp. Aaaaand it wasn't. I'm not a BBQ person but I would much rather have stayed closer to home and had something that I know is good like Honey Bears. Funny thing is, my fiance , who lived in Austin, TX for 12 years has been wanting to find a good place to go, I trust his judgement and this place was not it. Don't get me wrong, it was a cute establishment, very clean and the best part was the Coke machine that would spit out 50 different flavors of soda... but I can get that at Pei Wei. The first thing I bought was a peppermint rice crispy treat... awful and stale and also 3 dollars. The sandwich was not a great size, had some mild BBQ flavor but really nothing spectacular. The side potato salad was a bit bland, BUT the fries were pretty good., so  all was not lost. 
I liked the drive down there, it was pretty and me and my fiance had some quality time talking. the little town of Cave Creek is charming but never again will I venture up that way for this place. I am not even sure if I can trust the reviews on this establishment or any other in the area. It seems to me that people often confuse the price of their dinner with the quality. 

This is definitely not somewhere we will recommend nor visit again."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  The staff is alway friendly and attentive.  Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Rib and Meat Combo (Pulled Pork) with Chili & Slaw - that is all u need to know...oh and some pickled jalapeño"}
{"text":"Yum-ola!  Tried the brisket for the first time...usually, I'm a chicken sandwich fan.  Brisket was excellent.  As always, the ambiance at Bryan's is neighborhood-friendly and plain-but-simple-cozy.  My go-to for an easy-peasy, \"I-dont'-feel-like-cooking\" plan. Yay!"}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ joint. Cave Creek is a great little town near Phoenix. Bryan cooks up great traditional BBQ but he's a true chef! He makes a monthly special exotic dish and has seasonal specials. Pro Tips: try the brisket grease cornbread, stop for Sunday brunch for brisket hash, and ask about the secret menu!"}
{"text":"After my buddy Matt F. Raved about this place I had to give it a try. I got the two meat combo with the ribs and the pulled pork. The ribs were chewy and kind of fatty. The pulled pork was good.  The side of potato salad was a sour cream drenched version of a normal potato salad.  The fries were good. I wouldn't go out of my way again.  I have to say the best BBQ in Arizona is Bobby Q all day.  The ribs are fall off the bone and the pulled pork is amazing.
5 star Bobby Q
3 star Bryan's
Trust me!!"}
{"text":"Very good bbq.  Parking is tight and ambiance is poor but great food.  Best brisket I have had since Texas."}
{"text":"I had seen this place featured numerous times, magazines, TV, radio ads, but since I lived over an hour away it wasnt on the top of my list to try. When my husband was headed to the Cave Creek area for a short errand I decided here was the opportunity to try it out, and we were glad we did! I got the pulled pork sandwich with cowboy beans and my husband got the ribs with the coleslaw and potato salad. All were delicious! The ribs were my favorite, they had great flavor, they were moist and they practically fell off the bone. The potato salad is creamy but not too creamy, and the beans were fantastic! I would definitely recommend this place. The next time we are in the area we will be making a stop."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised at how good the tomato sandwich was....delicious!  Friendly people in the middle of Cave Creek....a fun place to experience the old West.  Weather is perfect from October to May.....then it heats up.  But still better than the ice and snow.  All kinds of sandwiches with barbecue sauces.  Yummy."}
{"text":"After all the great reviews I thought the food would be great.  It wasn't.  We both ordered the ribs ith different side orders ( fries, beans...etc)  The food is greasy,   It thrown on a paper plate and served in a sloppy fast food style.  We left without eating our plates."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.

World class BBQ (ESPECIALLY THE PULLED PORK), and a fantastic craft beer selection.

I have been going to this place consistently over the past 5 years and the consistency is astounding. I cannot remember a single time when Bryan was not in the kitchen. His dedication is what makes this place truly special."}
{"text":"Absolutely worth the drive from Phoenix!  As someone else said, the tomato sandwich is one of the best things I have ever eaten - cant wait to come back and order it again.  Beef brisket sandwich was also delicious - nice, smoky flavor!  Great job!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for the past few months. Most of the meat sandwiches are incredible with an added egg on top. My addiction; the bbq squash veggie sandwich. Spaghetti squash marinated in bbq sauce on a toasted bun - HEAVEN. I order mine with the bun on the side because it can get pretty saucy = soggy if you aren't a fast eater. I am a cole slaw fiend and can say Bryan's is some of my favorite, the olives are such a tasty addition. Crisp and cold, not soggy and room temp like some places. The potato salad is equally delicious, with an intense but not overpowering dill flavor. I have yet to try the beans, I prefer to have my grandma's famous baked beans and never feel like ordering them in restaurants. This place has great food and decent prices, especially for Cave Creek. I would give 5 stars if they weren't closed two days out of the week. 

edit: added a few pictures I took during dinner tonight"}
{"text":"We are here from NorCal.  Just ate here and the ribs and brisket dinner was outstanding!  This place just smells amazing!!! That smokey -this place is gonna be delicious smell---oh yeah!!!  I tried the lamb shank with ginger beer bbq sauce-if you like lamb you will die in a pile when you eat this!!! It was amazing!  Also had the cornbread made with the drippings from the briskit-oh man-soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Still the best beef brisket in Arizona!  We tried the cornbread, corn on the cob and watermelon slices, in addition to our sides.  Everything was awesome!  We all remarked how much the people working at Brian's seem to like their jobs and how they take pride in serving up great food."}
{"text":"I felt like I owed Bryan's an update.

Most new restaurants a few years in are starting to drop in quality, have increased prices, have hired unfriendly or unprofessional staff, or are venturing off in some very strange culinary directions.

NOT BRYAN'S.

The food is still as amazingly tasty as it was when he first opened.  AND, portion size has not decreased, nor has menu price increased.  That alone speaks volumes about how Bryan totally \"gets it\".  And the staff is just as friendly and hospitable as ever.  Truly - I walk in there and I feel like every member of Bryan's staff is concerned about how happy I am with my dining experience.

Now, he has added some new menu items.  But, keep in mind - this guy is a CIA grad (read:  real Chef, not a \"cook\" or backyard BBQ enthusiast), so I love when he flexes his food muscle.  But, ALL of the original core menu items are still here.  Heck, the menu board is the same as when he opened.  lol

But besides the food being completely yummy with huge portions and terrific value, the restaurant is always totally clean and inviting.  I have never once come in here and not been warmly greeted, and I've always sat at a table that was entirely clean.

Probably my *only* complaint about Bryan's, is that he's closed on SUN and MON.  I know a guy needs some time off, but I hope he feels confident one day to turn over the reigns, so that us junkies can eat every day of the week.  

So, the \"must haves\"  - the ribs are to die for.  Thick, meaty, fall-off-the bone, but not in that \"they're disintegrating because they're mostly fat or overcooked\" kinda way. The spicy BBQ sauce - I want to bathe in it or put a dab behind my ears and on my wrists.  Even the pulled chicken is always moist (do you know how hard this is to pull off with lean meats??).   And the fries.  Oh, the fries.  Absolutely the best anywhere.  Hand cut, made fresh for every order and just the right combo of crisp and meaty.  Potato salad - divine.  Potatoes are the right firmness, a perfect amount of dill and mayo.  Olive cole slaw?  Wish I thought of it, but since I didn't, I come to Bryan to get my slaw on.

Do yourself a favor.  Or, flavor.  Come to Bryan's.  And do yourself another favor and bring home take-out, because you'll want this stuff the next day again.

P.S.  Pick up his new cookbook!"}
{"text":"Wow, I had high hopes. 

1) Positives: It's an amazing ride out to Cave Creek from Scottsdale. You drive about 15 miles through the desert on a Cactus Scenic Drive and the sights are just amazing. Cave Creek -- when I got there -- was having a biker festival so it was crowded and I didn't see a place to stop. Looked like a cute little touristy town though. The restaurant is about a mile beyond and wasn't too crowded. 

When you arrive, there's additional parking around the back and the restaurant has a nice outdoor seating area. It's looks the part of a BBQ spot, but isn't a dive by any means. It looks local, western, a little kitschy, but fun. There's the right amount of neon. Service was friendly and I didn't wait too long after ordering for my food to be ready for pickup. 

2) Opportunities for growth: Once I got the food, I found the issues. I ordered a two-meat combo (ribs and brisket) and a side of cornbread which allegedly is baked in brisket drippings ($3.75!), and a bottle of the house beer.  The beer was okay. I wouldn't purchase anything else there again. Brisket was re-heated and lost any smoke flavor or color in the process. In fact, neither the brisket nor the ribs had ANY discernible flavor profile at all. The sauce didn't do much to help the matter. And the overpriced cornbread was so crumbly it was almost inedible. 

The folks are friendly and the drive is nice, but if you're looking for good BBQ, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Took a long drive for bbq which was pricy and most went in the trash...slaw and beans were good though..."}
{"text":"For the love of PETE MOVE HERE TO MY TOWN!

OMG! the food here was to die for. I have never had brisket like this! I mean really NEVER! I did not expect much and when I got my sandwich I was in SHOCK! I mean really it was like I was in HEAVEN! Service was nice and friendly and the food was just hot and fresh!!

The brisket was way way cool. I want to give this place a 10. This place made the visit all worth it. Thank god I found this place. I will come here every time! BEST FOOD BBQ FOOD EVER!!!!


COME HERE NOW Its that good!

GREAT JOB GUYS AND GALS!"}
{"text":"Recently spent 10 days in the Scottsdale/Cave Creek area and had the good fortune to eat at Bryan's three times - I am from barbeque country (Texas) but nothing we have compares to this place.  There are lots of unique items on the menu, but the standard items I tried are exceptional...brisket, ribs, the barbeque sauce, the cornbread, the potato salad, etc....etc....  All are unique and not like you find anywhere else.  The place has a lot of character (live entertainment, family atmosphere, etc.). This is a family owned business and the owners, Bryan and Donna, have an impressive background and are hands on and very warm and welcoming...You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and have always been thoroughly impressed. We split the two meat combo this time. Both the chicken and brisket  extremely moist and tender as always. The quality of the meat preparation here is just superb,  and their homemade barbecue sauce has a unique tanginess and smokiness that's hard to find in the valley. 
Also love the fresh thick cut fries,  and flavorful brisket grease infused cornbread. The one criticism I have is that although the flavor profile of the potato salad is delightful with a hearty helping of dill, the potatos were a little to dry for my liking...but that won't stop me from getting bona-fide BBQ! 
FYI Bryan's is fast casual so it is service by counter,  but you'll be happily surprised at the vast beer selection with all varietals of Shiner Bock,  Deschutes, and Dogfish Head. 
I also must give a warning.. watch out for the pickled jalapeño, unless you have a steel plated tongue,  it will literally make you feel that your throat has caught fire XXX"}
{"text":"Heading down from Sedona to Scottsdale, we drove through the very cool village of Cave Creek and stopped at Bryan's for some pulled pork barbecue and potato salad.  The pulled pork had a sauce mixed into it, not normally my thing but this worked well.  Solid BBQ in a very cool setting."}
{"text":"Having grown up in the midwest near Kansas City, I know a thing or two about barbecue.  I've tried pretty much all of the barbecue joints in the Phoenix area and Bryan's Barbecue is hands down the best you will find in the area.  

I have yet to try everything on the menu because the ribs are so good, I can't stop eating them!  It's like I go in with the thought of trying the chicken or the brisket, but somehow I just get sucked into buying a rack of ribs.  

So, don't be afraid to drive a little farther north than usual to find the best barbecue in the valley."}
{"text":"The brisket was tender but the BBQ sauce is incredibly bad.  It tastes like plain tomato sauce.  I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"So, my friend and I decided to spend the day hanging out together on this side of town. We both needed to get out of the house, and go for a pretty drive.

While we were driving down the Carefree Hwy, we swung by and hung a left on Cave Creek road because its been a while since we had been to this side of town.  While we were driving, we parked the car in town and found this place.  I spotted it from across the street, and we ran in to get some food.

Place is cute, with a nice patio and plenty of seating inside as well. Mostly tables with some booths. It's a fast casual type place, so you go, place your order, and they call your name when the orders ready.

The food itself was really good. I went with the brisket sandwich with fries and a drink. My friend went with the half chicken, baked potato salad (which had sour cream) and a drink. the potatos were awesome! I wish I had ordered it as my side instead!

Brisket was soft and tasty, and my friend enjoyed his chicken a lot.  It didn't come with a ton of BBQ sauce on it (which is fine by me) and you can always add more from the BBQ sauce station that they have set up in the condiment area.  I really liked the condiment area because not only was it neat and clean, but it was well stocked. I also like that they have a decent selection of food to choose from as well.

Overall, we really enjoyed our time here. If your in the area, or want to try excellent BBQ, please, go eat here. Place is awesome! Patio is a great size as well.  Make the trip, you'll be really happy you did!"}
{"text":"great authentic bbq, open kitchen and can see the chef chopping and plating each order. excellent and huge portions."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim with a group of friends after finding that the Thai place down the road was closed to see if just by chance that had something on the menu that was Vegan or Vegetarian friendly...Although usually a stretch for a BBQ joint and our expectation was only to find french fries, we were pleasantly surprised to find the Vegetarian \"Pulled\" Squash sandwich.  It was tasty and worth a stop if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Finally made it with my friends from Cave Creek, who talked it up a lot! They were right, it is an excellent BBQ spot. I had the two-meat combo with shredded chicken and brisket, both were the appropriate amount of smoke and had excellent flavor. For sides I had the potato salad and coleslaw because those are standards that you have to try. The potato salad was really good, with a dill dressing that is unique and flavorful. The coleslaw will be a love or not kind of situation, and I didn't love it. They use green olives in it which for me gave it a very strange flavor, though it's similar to a Regal Slaw that I make, which is lighter and without tons of mayo. They have sweet pickled jalapeños with the meal that are really good! Can't believe that no one has thought to do that before. I tried my friend's tomato sandwich as well, which was excellent, their fries are well done and the sweetbread jalapeño poppers are something to behold! To top it off, I ordered the watermelon for dessert which comes with a generous portion, topped with honey and cardamom, a unique and delicious way to end a meal! 
They have one of the new choose you mix Coke machines which was cool, the setting was nice and it's modern, aside from the bathrooms being outside the restaurant, though they are easily accessible, both from distance and ADA compliance. I would definitely return here and would probably be a regular if I lived nearby, though you can tell many people are because it does quite a brisk business."}
{"text":"Really top notch barbecue! It is the sauce that really puts it over the top. We tend to like the spicier stuff and they deliver the taste! Plus they have a rather adventurous menu for my husband with seasonal frog legs and ostrich burgers! I stick with the pulled chicken and have never been disappointed.  The outside seating is so nice in the spring and fall and even has live music on some weekends."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with a friend who raved about their BBQ and fries. The place was not too busy when arrive, maybe it's because we came around 30 mins before closing, but many people did come after us too. We got a the BBQ chicken sandwich, ribs, brisket, fries, brisket chili and cornbread. Now I don't know if we just got the end-of-the-day-and-we-are-not-open-tomorrow janky batch or it maybe just a fluke, the food was not even close to the hype. Even my friend who regulars the place for lunch apologized for the quality of the food, especially the fries which she taunted was the best ever. The BBQ was OK-the chicken was moist, the brisket wasn't too dry and the ribs we bleh. I always judge a BBQ place on the sauce and the cornbread (because what's BBQ without cornbread). Sauce was good, not outstanding, I personally prefer a sweeter sauce and this was more hickory/ savory. The cornbread was made with brisket fat I believe, but it was kind of dry and the brisket fat overpowered the cornbread flavor and was too smokey in my opinion. The chili was more watery and not really hitting any chili marks. Might have been a 4 star and up if they were on their game and up to the hype."}
{"text":"Smoked to perfection!  The ribs were excellent (and I'm very picky about ribs)!  Potato salad was cool and and very tasty in between my bites of ribs and the brisket.  We also had this really crazy but good watermelon slices that had honey and jalapeño on them.  Wow!  This place is got it going on!  Congratulations to the owner and awesome team he has assembled!"}
{"text":"Terrific BBQ in the middle of this faraway--to me, at least--town. Great brisket. And the best cornbread this jaded NYer ever had."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in AZ hands down. The potato salad is incredible and the brisket is tender and moist. They even have amazing veggie options like pulled squash and a seasonal tomato sandwich. Great beer selection too. We'll definitely be back, I want to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"After hearing family members talk this place up for some time, I finally had a chance to stop by. I had the two-meat platter--brisket (sliced) and chicken. Both were excellent. The chicken was very moist and the brisket was lean. I tend to be picky about brisket, and was pleased with how it was prepared. The ambience of the place was a plus. It goes with the overall feel laid back feel of Cave Creek."}
{"text":"This is our second time here and we are both very impressed. Tonight we tried the \"loaded fries\". Three pounds of yumminess. Fries, shredded beef, beans, jalapeños, green onions and ranch drizzled all over the top. Freakin' awesome. Enough for 3 people unless one of you can stuff yourselves. The mint chocolate chip ice cream cookie is amazing as well!!!"}
{"text":"I was in one of those situations in Dec where I needed a place to host a party for 30 and didn't know the area where we would all be meeting.  Thanks to Yelp I found Bryan's and called to arrange use of their back room.  I couldn't have been happier.  From start to finish they made things easy and enjoyable.  The food was perfect and the service couldn't have been better.  We have since told all of our friends when they're out that way to stop in.  I always appreciate a place that makes my life a little easier."}
{"text":"Every time when we're going to Bartlet Lake we stop for dinner. The food is great, the place is inviting and cool. Great choice of beer and drinks. 
Surprising specials and good desserts!"}
{"text":"Unless you have had the frog legs don't get them, 12.95 with no sides . BAD , REALLY BAD

OVER PRICED,  

Greedy over priced"}
{"text":"Pulled Pork and Coleslaw sandwich!!! 

I have been driven by this sandwich to drive my butt up to Cave Creek from Phoenix once a month for the past year and a half. Just don't do it on Sundays or Mondays, they are closed. I have made that mistake more than once. 

I should say that there are other stars on the menu, and every now and then I stray to the ribs (2nd fav.), the chicken (3rd fav.), or the brisket (love it but the other items are soo good) but that pulled pork sandwich with the coleslaw and that sweet brined jalapeno is such a treat. 

The bun Bryan's is using is the perfect complement for this sandwich, and they butter and toast it to perfection before Piling on the smokey goodness of the best pulled pork my buds have come across. 

You get the choice of side and although the beans are very good (we usually order as well), the slaw is amazing. Besides the slaw must go on the sandwich.

 Lets face it there are not many combinations that reach the ecstasy of flavor, texture, and temperature that a mound of hot, smokey, tangy, moist  pulled pork topped with a cold, crisp, sweet, tart coleslaw then wrapped in a perfectly toasted, yet chewy bun does. Add that cold, soft, sweet, but spicy jalapeno that is served with all the plates and I'm screaming. Hallelujah! Thank you Bryan!

Wear a short sleeve shirt because the juices will run down your hands,  and your forearms, to your elbows yet you will continue making out with your sandwich.

Don't forget the sides of Bryan's bbq sauces for a little extra kick!

Dang, I'm hungry. Carpool?"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has all of the great reviews!  I've had better BBQ in Chicago and that pretty much sums it up!  BBQ sauce had no flavor!"}
{"text":"As good as BBQ gets!!!!!

Great atmosphere, friendly service, great beer selection and incredible food!  I have lived in Texas and all over the South and I never expected to find the best BBQ in Arizona.  Try it all, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go here immediately, the drive is worth it!  Best BBQ I've had in AZ, and I've had a lot!  The brisket sandwich is next level.  The brisket is juicy and tender, the bun is perfectly toasted.   

I've never liked potato salad but their Dill Potato Salad is incredible...I'M OBSESSED!!!  Great local beers too!"}
{"text":"Place is cool but they are serving up some very lame overpriced brisket, brisket was dry with no flavor but some bland smokiness, would have gave them 2 stars if it wasn't overpriced, if you haven't had amazing brisket then you will think this place is great, sign says trust the chef, guess I should have known there wasn't a pit master onsite"}
{"text":"This is a very cute and nice bar-b-q restaurant. It was delicious as well!  My hubby had the pork sandwich and fries which he loved. The fries are delicious!! 
I had the chicken sandwich with the cowboy beans which are amazing. The cornbread is awesome as well. The staff is very nice. They are extremely clean which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Our go to BBQ place!  We love this place.  Granted I haven't ventured away from my Pulled Pork sandwich with coleslaw on top.. and fries.  But why stray if you've already found perfection.  

Very casual, good for kids.  Place has a great atmosphere, love the staff.  

Just wish they were open a bit later.. but it is Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Prior to last month I had only driven through Cave Creek one other time in my life. There seem to be many cute shops in the area and the temperatures are cooler at night than other areas of the valley because of the surrounding desert. I was very excited when I heard we were going to be eating at Bryan's BBQ because I love BBQ and the reviews are pretty amazing.  

We ate here on Saturday for a family Birthday lunch. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of french fries and a soda. The pulled pork on the sandwich was nice and moist and also dressed well with BBQ sauce. The bun was also toasted around the edges and that made the sandwich soooooo much better! The french fries were hot and really tasty The meal also included a jalapeno which interestingly tasted kind of sweet to me which I enjoyed. 

There were many funny signs around the restaurant and a guitar hanging on the wall that said \"play me.\" What really made me enjoy this establishment was how amazing the food is and also how relaxed the environment is. Very casual and family friendly which I enjoyed. I do plan on returning to Cave Creek and Bryan's BBQ in the near future."}
{"text":"Brought some out-of-town visitors here for authentic AZ BBQ and was not disappointed. 
Pulled pork and potato salad really tasty and loved by all.  Ribs were decent. 
Excellent casual atmosphere with big tables for families. 
Only setback is kitchen fell a bit behind when place got busy and late arrivals in our party waited 40 minutes for dinner.
Overall, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Worth the drive from Phoenix. Great pork ribs. Fantastic dry rub & sauce. Excellent barbecue smell out in front of the restaurant on Cave Creek Rd. A tasty side dish is the 6 pack cowboy beans, as they have brisket bits inside. Best BBQ in the Valley..."}
{"text":"So we moved to Cave Creek and heard about this place.... It lives up to it's reputation as is really good!!  Decent portions...
Little touches like cole slaw made with olive oil DO make a difference. We will be stopping for lunch or dinner in the near future. Spicy BBQ was hot, but not crazy. Also not sure what's in the cowboy beans but it was really good to. Oh ya, but like most places in downtown Cave Creek no need to get dressed up!!"}
{"text":"I am so depressed! I live in the town of Cave Creek and have held Bryan's as my little secret, eating there 2 times a week for the past few months.  Now, the Arizona Republic comes out with a rave review and the place is packed.

Good news - the food is still made to order, hot (temperature) and lovely.  I have grown especially fond of the vegetarian version of a BBQ sandwich.  Even though I eat meat - I have died and gone to heaven every time I have one of Bryan's BBQ'd spaghetti squash sandwiches. Try one and you will see what I mean.  His sauces, especially the spicy one, are devine and the sides are tasty.  I always go with the fries but I love the potato salad too.

I newer addition of the Big Pig is also great if my husband is with me. Imagine a BBQ version of nachos - trading the chips with Byran's delicious fries and then loading the plate with his BBQ meat!

The place is ultra clean - thanks to all of his dedicated employees and you will find Bryan himself either behind the counter cooking or walking the floor making sure all of the diners are happy.  

Only two complaints- Bryan's is closed sunday and the tv in the place is set to old movies.  If I could watch the Cardinal's play and eat a sandwich - that would be true bliss."}
{"text":"Really Good place for a normal mom's and papa's shop. Food was fresh service awesome and prices were right. Two thumbs up and keep on the good thing going BBMB;))))))))))"}
{"text":"From the posters of Arizona in old-time western movies to the unique take on each of the side dishes, Bryan has done good. Welcome to Cave Creek - we needed you. The barbeque is all excellent, particularly the pulled pork and squash. The sauce is tangy and the hot sauce has a memorable edge. All the sides have a fun difference: the cole slaw with olives, the beans with a tasty sausage and the potato salad that provides a good balance with the barbeque. The jalapeno pepper pickle is a fun surprise - sweet and just right. For desert the mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwiches formed with chocolate chip cookies were an excellent finish. Beer and wine is available, and you can eat outside to take in Black Mountain and Cave Creek. Come on up to the high country and enjoy real western barbeque with a twist. It's no Joe's Real BBQ, but it's awfully good and so much more convenient for those of us in the North Valley."}
{"text":"Love this place. Close to my house so that's a plus. My family loves it here as do I do. A downfall to this place is that they're closed on Sundays. Another downside is that you smell like barbecue after leaving this place. The Chicken Sandwhich is the best I've had here."}
{"text":"Had the pulled chicken sandwich which was very very good...very juicy, and tender, fall off the bone kinda thing. Their baked potato salad is absolutely awful....Prices are very high...lunch for four $ 75 bucks...I think Pork on a Fork is a lot better!"}
{"text":"I visited Bryan's for the first time yesterday.  The interior of the restaurant is cute and the staff was friendly.  The food, however, was disappointing.  The pulled pork was stringy and tough.  The pulled chicken was watery and lacked flavor unless sauce was added.  Neither of these items had the texture or flavor of slow-cooked, smoked barbecue.  My friend had the chicken and brisket and echoed my assessment of the chicken.  She did say the brisket was better-about average but nothing to get excited about.  The cole slaw, french fries and baked beans were tasty.  The potato salad was mushy and boring and tasted like it had two ingredients:  potatoes and bottled ranch dressing.

In summary our meal was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"So I wouldn't normally drive all the way to Cave Creek for anything but we had the week off, I had to go to Desert Ridge, and I saw this place in the Phoenix Magazine.  Needless to say, save the gas.

The place is cute on the inside and really had a lot of promise.  The sides all sounded good and I couldn't decide between the pulled pork or the brisket so I got both.  Added a side of potato salad and a side of beans.  

Where to begin?

The pork wasn't bad but it wasn't bbq.  I mean, it didn't taste smokey or sweet.  It tasted boiled...and that's nasty.  It was fatty and generally just lacking flavor.  The bbq sauce they put on the thing was decent but they didn't have any of it out for me to get more.  What they did have were \"regular\" and \"spicy\" bbq sauces.  Both were thin, both were a bit spicy, and neither was up to the task of fixing this pork.

The brisket was really a disaster.  It was cut like ham slices.  Really thick with a big hunk of fat around the outside that I had to remove from each slice.  This whittled my beef down to medallion sized bits.  The taste was fine but the thick texture, lack of bbq sauce, and fatty presentation was all disappointing.

The beans were okay but I expected sweeter.  BBQ baked beans, in my mind, should be sweet and savory.  These, like everything else here, were just bland and dull.  I tried mixing some of the runny bbq sauce available but it really didn't help.

The saving grace was the potato salad.  This was some of the best stuff I've ever had.  I would totally buy a pound of that to bring to a dinner party.  They should package it and sell it in the stores.  Really it was creamy and sweet without overpowering the potato flavor.  Good stuff and well executed.

Will not be going back here.  Too bad too because it had a lot of promise.  Oh well.  There is no shortage of bbq in the valley."}
{"text":"Even getting to Bryan's was fun! The drive in from Scottsdale brings you through darling, western-style Cave Creek. This place has been on my bookmark list for-EVER. We sat on the patio and I had a half slab and some fries. The fries were pretty good, and the ribs were pretty amazing. The reason I only gave this four stars is that I didn't \"love love\" the sauce. I actually like Famous Dave's or Sweet Baby Ray's sauce better - may be just a personal preference thing. My mom got the pulled pork Sandwich and \"love love\"ed it. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed Bryans' Black Mountain BBQ very much. 
We had the Brisket, ribs, and BBQ Chicken sandwich on toasted brioche. The portions were generous and there were plenty of sides to choose from. 
Cave Creek is a cool area to trip around, if you're into antiques & treasures."}
{"text":"All in all, really wonderful food full of flavor and a lot to choose from.  They only offer dry brisket so if you are a moist brisket fan, find something else to order.  Plenty to choose from or dunk the brisket in the sauce to moisten it up."}
{"text":"I don't really give any restaurants a five star rating but considered it here.  This is the best barbecue I've ever had and is definitely worth the 50 minute trip from central phoenix.

My favorite is the pulled pork sandwich topped with a fried egg and the olive coleslaw side dish - but the cowboy beans and brisket are really great as well.  

I used to live in Cave Creek and I miss this place more than anything else up there.  If you're anywhere near the area, do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ that I have had in the area! Always a must try, if they haven't ran out, would be the cornbread, AMAZING!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork with the spicy sauce is amazing! The place is very clean with a cool southwestern atmosphere. Easy to grab something to go, or quick service to sit and enjoy. If your in the area Brian's BBQ is a must!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ, not a waited service, more of a fast food style with great atmosphere and live guitar on Sat night.
Would eat here again"}
{"text":"Insanely awesome. All the meats have a beautiful smoky flavor. Though their sauces are good but not standout, its totally fine because the flavor and juiciness of the meats obviates the need for sauce.  Pulled pork sandwiches are big enough for a standalone meal.  Great bottled beer selections. Great staff. Great location, worth a trip from wherever you are coming from."}
{"text":"Took a drive and ended up in Cave Creek.  Saw that Yelp gave this restaurant 4 1/2 stars so decided to try it.  Great restaurant, super clean and well set up.  People are super nice but...the important thing was the food...we ordered brisket sandwiches with potato salad and fries.  The brisket was delicious, portions were generous, the fries were crispy and the potato salad was lightly seasoned with dill.  It was delicious.  Their bbq sauce was quite delicious.  I would definitely go back here and would happily work my way through their menu.  We sat outside on their patio and enjoyed the fair Phoenix weather."}
{"text":"We tried the pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches. The barbeque sauce is different from most, but we enjoyed it very much.  The meats were tender and juicy, and the sauce was quite tasty.

The potato salad was good, but not great.  The baked beans were something that we would not try again... the flavor was too spicy/smokey and just not to our liking.  The french fries were great, though, so no complaints there.

Overall, we enjoyed our meal and will be back.  We'll just select different sides the next time around.  Three sandwiches, sides and sodas ran just over $32, so not too bad."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Heard about this place and bookmarked it on Yelp about two months ago knowing I'd get there one day because it is about 30 miles from my home. My advice is DO NOT wait as long as I did!  I love BBQ and my favorites are brisket from Rudy's in Austin and ribs from Pappy's in St Louis and this place is just as good and I can get them both here...and only 30 miles away. 
Sides are unique and good, recommend the potato salad, fries are great, coleslaw with olives may not appeal to everyone but if you love olives you'll be pretty happy. Sauce is KC style and served warm, very nice touch.
Best BBQ meat in Arizona without question. These guys are serious and you can taste their passion for what they do in everything they make.
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wanted to really like his place. Great decor and atmosphere. Problem is everything is in BBQ sauce. It all tastes the same. Fries were good but heavily salted. Not a fan"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Frog Leg Friday and even though I'm no connoisseur of frog legs these were absolutely delicious. Very tender and tasty and not at all greasy. You get a dozen for $12  and they are fried in a light batter. We shared the 12 which was a perfect amount but we devoured them in no time. We also had the brisket stew which was tasty but don't be in hurry to taste it. It was so burning hot I burnt the roof of my mouth and I am still suffering the consequences of it 5 days later. The stew comes with brisket grease cornbread, it may not sound good but it was moist and delicious could have easily gone for seconds on that.  This was the first time we have gone to Bryan's and not gotten BBQ but as always it was worth the trip."}
{"text":"One of the best bbq places I've been to! Bryan really knows his stuff! Everything is always fresh and delicious. The service is always  friendly."}
{"text":"OMG. The.Best.BBQ.EVER. I thought I was in heaven when I got the combo meat platter but I tried one of the sandwiches last week and the way they toasted the bun and pulled the meat apart was so delicious!"}
{"text":"I was catching a few episode of Check Please Arizona on PBS and caught this place. So, we tried it. If we are in Cave Creek, we will go here again for sure. I have not been impressed with the other choices we have made in Cave Creek so far. 
They were out of the Chalkboard Pig for the day, which was rabbit, so I won't comment. We had decent brisket with a couple pieces of burnt ends that had some flavor. Very good. These guys have spent some time in Texas with brisket prep. The pulled pork was decent too. This day, it wasn't as flavorful as some have described, but still decent and best so far in Phoenix.  Texans don't make good ribs, so we channeled KC and Memphis to gauge these. They were decent. Had a smoke ring and pretty good flavor. Could have been more tender, but the flavor was there, so A-OK goes the star rating. A solid 3 stars. The famous olive cole slaw was a FAIL in our opinions, but it definitely wasn't the normal slaw. Count us in the DO NOT column. The beans were disappointing too because the brisket was good, so I thought they would take some Texas bean pointers too, but nope. Maybe if you had a six-pack before eating the Six Pack beans, they would taste better! Har har. The potato salad was decent, but a little heavy on the mayo. The fries were fresh and not soggy. My husband liked the beer selection. I doubt we will try to fight the crowd for the Frog Leg Friday, but maybe. The homemade ice cream sandwich looked tasty too. Another reason for the 3 star rating instead of 4 was because the service was lacking. We were never asked how the food was after it was lacklusterly dropped on the table and our drinks were never full. We had to ask for beer twice. I would say there were about 10 tables total at the time. Not satisfactory in my opinion."}
{"text":"Amazing food !!! Great atmosphere along with fast and friendly service! Worth the 70 mile drive!"}
{"text":"75+ visits...never been disappointed. I've actually been to Bryan's over 75 times since they opened in '09. I've also brought 20-30 others into Bryan's and no one, including myself, has ever been less than delighted with every aspect of this establishment and their food. 

In response to a couple negative reviews -

Fries - Indeed the fries will be soggy if you let them sit for 30 minutes, take them home, and eat them later. However, they are perfectly crispy if you eat them during your visit. They are some of the best fries in the valley actually. 

Buns - The buns are grilled perfectly to achieve a golden layer of deliciousness which prevents the bun from absorbing moisture. Again, if you don't eat any BBQ right away, it gets weird later on. Eat it immediately and grab two napkins - one to clean your mouth and one to dry your tears...it's THAT good.

Coleslaw - This is the best coleslaw I've ever had. Bryan includes the perfect amount of high-quality olives in the slaw which sets it apart from the pretenders out there serving store-bought coleslaw. 
Ribs - Real BBQ ribs are NOT supposed to fall off the bone. That's reserved for crockpot and boiled ribs, which are not barbecued. These ribs are amazing. 

Sauce - Sauce is the one area of BBQ that's extremely subjective. It's similar to salad dressing, and other condiments, in that regard. Personally, it's the best BBQ sauce I've ever had and I have a cupboard full of it at home. However, some like their sauce sweet, some like it with mustard, some like vinegar, some like spice, some like ketchup, etc. I make a lot of sauce at home, and I've never made sauce this good. If you want a great selection of really sweet sauce, try Famous Dave's. For a unique, amazing, perfect sauce (in my opinion at least) go to Bryan's immediately. 

Beer - The beer selection is one of the best in the valley. Bryan has hand-selected every bottle and his choices are impressive. Mostly local, craft, microbrew selections. Good prices too - that can be said for everything on the menu. 

If you had a bad experience at Bryan's, which is almost impossible for me to believe because I'm 75 for 75 here, please consider trying it again. Not for the sake of the business, but for your own sake. It's so amazing, I feel obligated to tell everyone about it and make them go. Heck, I'll meet you there and buy your meal if it's not incredible. Or, the owners will probably buy you another meal if you were disappointed the first time. They are very nice and are very proud of their food.

{"text":"Pretty good BBQ for Arizona.  The restaurant has a great Mississippi Delta vibe and the food is great.  If you don't feel like driving to Cave Creek they deliver through Delivery.com."}
{"text":"If I were grumpy today, I would give this place just one star.  During our fall break, the husband and I were knocking out quite a few of the best new restaurants in Phoenix Magazine, and this happened to be one of them.  I was pretty excited because I really like barbecue and it's fun to compare different places.  Unfortunately, this place didn't compare to any other BBQ place.  I honestly thought it was terrible, almost to the point of being inedible.

The restaurant itself is pretty cute.  I love the old western movies playing, the decor is rustic and cute, and its very clean inside.  Unfortunately, it must have been a really really REALLY off day for them, especially considering the raves from Deb (and I trust her reviews.)  I ordered the beef brisket with a side of the Cowboy Olive Cole Slaw.  It sounded fascinating.  Before our meal arrived I got some extra BBQ sauce, and that was the first indicator that this would be no good for me.

Honestly, the sauce tasted like hot sauce with a little bit of ketchup in it.  It was really watery, and I like really thick sauces.  I just really hated the flavor.  My brisket was terribly dry and overcooked.  There was no falling apart as I cut it, mostly just sawing motions to get through the nearly 1/2 inch slab.  I think brisket should be cut much thinner than that.  Fortunately, there was a decent smokey flavor that was present, and that made my meat palatable.  I figured the cole slaw would be better.  It wasn't.  It really just tasted like someone emptied a can of olive juice into a generic batch of cole slaw.

The only thing worth eating here was the baked potato salad, but it wasn't my side dish to eat.  This place was a big ol let down for me.  Like I said, this must have been a really bad day for them, because I don't think you win one of the best new restaurant spots for nothing."}
