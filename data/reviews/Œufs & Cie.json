{"text":"Typical breakfast restaurant, nothing special. The service was long but they are really busy on weekends. There was no special flavor in the plate. The Price/Quality wasn't that good. ( Western crepes & meatlover plates with a smoothie mango framboise). The Service girl was kind and funny."}
{"text":"Disgusting chicken benedict, bad bread, bad hollandaise sauce, cheese slice was half melted, half solid. Chicken has been sitting in fridge for too long, tasted awful and it was cold, there was a slice of tomato in there which it was also fridge cold and hard as rock!. I will not return to this place even if they pay me to eat here! avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat. Will come again. The service were good?Un bel endroit pour manger. Reviendra. Le service était bon."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast restaurants in the entire Montreal area.

The food is fresh and always delicious. It's so easy to find parking at Ths Quartier Dix 30 which is where it is located.

This place is way better than Cora's and Tutti Frutti and the servers are always so upbeat and pleasant.

I go here atleast once a week."}
{"text":"I went for the first time yesterday with my mom. I got a rather pricey breakfast with 2 English muffins with eggs, ham, tomato and mayo, along with potatoes and a Greek yogurt with granola and blueberry jam thing on it. It was on the Breakfast of the Day menu so the coffee came with it for free.

My mom got a very less expensive eggs, sausage, beans, fruits and toast.

The English muffin was good, nothing too special. The Greek yogurt was... Greek yogurt shaped as a scoop of ice cream. (I'm personally not a fan of Greek yogurt). It wasn't sweet, only sweetened by the blueberry jam thing (such scientific terms!).

The eggs were eggs, sausage was ok. The potatoes however, they were great. They were seasoned with some herbs (which is better than some other places).

The service was a little slow, but from what I saw, there was only 1 person cooking in the back. Waitress was bilingual and good. When my mom accidentally dropped her knife, they came by and asked if she was ok and gave her a new one.

Overall I would go back again, but will choose something less filling. We ended up taking most of the potatoes home for lunch. Good potatoes"}
{"text":"Just another breakfast place. Nothing particular to say, other than the fact that their side of fruits that comes with the eggs benedict is actually huge. It's a separate plate! Standard smoked salmon eggs benedict, potatoes were good but not remarkable, service was average. There was a big line up though, and the entrance is really not made to accomodate long line ups, so an overall lack of organization, maybe that's something to fix."}
{"text":"Service is incredibly slow. The food is average and for the portion, compare to other similar brunch places, is small for the price"}
{"text":"Located within the mega center on Montreal's south shore that simply doesn't stop growing of the \"Quartier 10-30\", Oeufs & Cie is available for your breakfast needs. There was no-lineup at 11 AM on a Saturday which was impressive. The placed was packed with just one table available. It was fate.

I don't remember much of the meal to be honest but I took the standard thing (eggs, sausage, potatoes, toasts, etc) and I was perfectly fine with it. Nothing in particular stood out beyond the service being very good and attentive. The price-tag was good too."}
{"text":"How do you mess up breakfast...when you're a BREAKFAST PLACE?!?!?!?!?! 

Hands down the most disgusting expensive for what it was breakfast I have ever had the dissatisfaction of cramming down my throat ever! No lie. 

Where to start....

K the coffee...typical shitty breakfast place coffee. Fine willing to let it slide. 

A billion options on the menu but somehow I always order good ol' bacon n eggs... The bacon is that fake paper thin shit u microwave for 10 seconds and obviously tastes fake and horrible (bonus:  4 whole slices to make up for the cheap quality? I duno, maybe.) The eggs are f&*$ing HORRENDOUS....and they're just sposed to be easy over...how did u f*ck that one up seriously?!?! The breakfast potatoes...WTF did u do to those potatoes?? Au pire just don't do anything at all to them guys, just cook them properly for crissake. The toast: you know the bread doesn't hafta contain more margarine than grain, right? Did u know that??

Boyfriend isn't much into breakfast, can't eat eggs and not much of an appetite for the first meal of the day so he orders one of their smoothies (Cherry Blossom) and a side of sausage. The smoothie is 5.25 for barely a child's amount of unripe and frozen fruits grinded to an oblivion of sour tasteless terribleness. The sausages look different than most breakfast sausages: intriguing at first but a total disgusting let down. 

The wifi password...supposedly Meatlove or MeatLove or MeetLove or meatlove or some version I couldn't figure out for the life of me. Goodluck connecting if you're trying. 

The ONLY decent thing about this place was the amazingly QUICK service: and i mean lightning fast! Unfortunately that quick service resulted in her answering her own question stating yes when she asked if everything was to our liking... Um no. No it wasn't...but at least u made that awful experience go by fast.

We will not be back. This place should close it's so terrible."}
{"text":"La place est bien et contrairement à quelques-uns des restaurants du quoi, on n'attend pas très longtemps pour une table!

Il y a beaucoup de choix dans le menu, parfait pour ceux qui aiment les déjeuners traditionnels et tout aussi adéquat pour ceux qui préfèrent manger autre chose que deux oeufs bacon.

Le service est correct. Disons que nous sommes tombés sur une serveuse un peu bête, mais les assiettes sont arrivées chaudes et nous avons eu en masse de refill de café!"}
{"text":"In the super competitive world of breakfast restaurants, there really is no shortage of choice in the Montreal area.
Oeufs & Cie offers a mix of everything and does nothing special.

Since the other breakfast joint in dix 30 \"Allo Mon Coco\" is always full on weekends, we opted for this place and were seated very quickly. Although it is not an old restaurant, the sign and interior decor/colors looks drab. There is vomit green paint on the walls that I really do not find appealing and half the restaurant is in a closed off, dark area with no windows. Unfortunately that is where we were seated and it didn't help the experience. The walls are not only of an ugly color but they are tons of scuff marks and scratches.

As for the food, I ordered a basic breakfast of eggs, ham, bacon, toast and potatoes and my partner had a breakfast casserole. The portion is average however the cut of ham and bacon are paper thin as another reviewer commented on.
I was expecting a thicker breakfast style ham but was served 1 slice of black forrest thin deli meat. The bacon also looked liked the microwavable type.

Service was slow, our server came only once after half an hour to refill coffee and really there was nothing oustanding about the food. It wasn't awful nor great, just OK.

I wouldn't come back mostly because I find the place so depressing. You do not want to start your day here."}

Journée de repos après une grande journée d'animation à l'ETS.

Bel endroit, bien éclairé, on m'accueil à l'entrée mais je choisi ma place moi-même, tel que c'est écrit à l'entrée. La charmante Catherine, la serveuse, me demande avec quoi je commence. Un bon smootie aux bananes-bleuets. Je choisi les oeufs bénédictine avec épinard et jambon car c'est une excellente manière de tester un resto déjeuner. La sauce Hollandaise, est un peu blanche et fade mais pas si mal. Le service est rapide et efficace. On en resort heureux et bien rempli. L'assiette était copieuse :-)

A day-off avec a big animation day at ETS.

Nice place, well lit, you are greated as you enter, but you simply choose your place as it is asked on the plate when you come in. The charming Catherine, the waitress, asks for a choice of startup beverage. I choose the daily smootie : banana-blueberries. I pick eggs benedict with spinach and ham because it's a good way to test a breakfast place. The Hollandaise sauce a little bite on the white side and a little light on taste, but not too bad. The service is very fast and efficient. You come out of there happy and full. The meal was copious :-)"}
