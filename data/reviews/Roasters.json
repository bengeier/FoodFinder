{"text":"Un très grand espace plutôt vide et un service horrible. La qualité des aliments était correct mais sans plus. Je n'y retournerai pas. Nous avons attendu plus de 25 minutes pour un déjeuner et une pizza. Nous n'étions pas les seuls a attendre, des gens attendaient depuis 20 minutes pour avoir le droit de payer leurs factures. Bref, un service horrible et sans âme."}
{"text":"Nice coffee selection, nicely presented, nice atmosphere, nice staff. Cannot comment on restaurant as just been a few times for coffee."}
{"text":"C'était la première fois que je visitais un Restaurant de cette chaîne et je n'ai pas été déçu. La nourriture était bonne, les assiettes très garnies même un peu trop surtout les Nachos mais c'était très bon. 
Le service était amical et les serveuses gentilles. Service rapide et pas trop dispendieux. J'y retournerai certainement."}
{"text":"I visited this coffee shop under the illusion that they roasted their own coffee onsite - due to the name, the detailed website and the pictures of the roaster and farms. 
However, this is not true!! I was quite disappointed to find they simply purchased beans from a supplier (albeit a reputable one). On the day I went too, I am afraid I saw none of the superb barista skills, rather a was served a scorched latte and house coffee from a broken cafetiere (which, incidently, was over dosed making it rather sludgy). 
A bit more attention to detail wouldnt go amiss, especially to the decor and the cleaning rota. 
Sorry guys, sure we just got you on a bad day service wise, but you cant get away from the fact that there is very little to make this place stand out."}
{"text":"They serve an immense amount of food on the plate. Nothing spectacular, we aren't talking haute cuisine. The service was excellent. The food... well, it's rotisserie chicken and ribs, folks. Not worth driving out of the way,but if you are looking for something informal and you are in the neighbourhood, it's a good choice."}
{"text":"I am so sorry to be writing this. For daytime coffee and light snacks this place is perfectly functional. However in the last 2 weeks it has expanded into a restaurant opening until 10pm where the Portuguese chef Antonio does a selection of tapas and Mexican dishes.
There is no serving alcohol licence and there is a corkage of £2 which is reasonable. the menu on offer looks ok and comes at roughly £4 a Tapas with deals of 3 for £8, 5 for £15, 8 for £17.50 and 10 for £25.
We went about 8pm and were the only customers. The service was obviously very attentive. The food however, in one word, and I am sorry to say it, was simply awful. I have never been served such rubbish. We had beef so dry I could have gone mountain climbing on its' cracks and fissures, another so slimy I thought there had been a slug salting play off on my plate. The sauces on the chicken thighs and ribs were just awful. All I heard during the prep of my meal was the ping of the microwave. I never heard the frying pan, the sizzle of the grill, nothing. This was pure rubbish served by a man trying to be a chef who at best is a third class cook. Do not let this detract from the fact that Antonio is a very nice guy who wants to please you. The service, did I say, was good. The dessert of some sort of rice pudding, in contrast to the rest , was good but in reflection, on its own, was pretty bad. I was so upset to be writing this. I wanted so much to be writing better. This cook has the passion without a doubt, unfortunately he has not got the palate or talent to back it up"}
{"text":"The chicken was OK. Nothing to be crazy about. The slaw was basically cabbage and mayo. The Mac and cheese were actually not too bad. But the pricing are definitely not reflecting the quality of the food. For 1 meal I paid 25$ and it was not even satisfying. Not recommending this place. Unless you are lost and starving to death."}
{"text":"A nice place, good food, good service and family friendly. It has an underground free parking just underneath the Brick. If you happen to be in the area shopping then you can have a nice break there. It also has a bar area with TVs."}
{"text":"It's a bit strange, as the place is correctly pinned on the map the address actually not a fit
However the name matches and I hope I'm writing for the right place
I've been here frequently
I've tried the steak with fries, Caesar salad, turkey, pizzas and hamburgers 
The steak is my favorite thu!
At times they have on promotion this Rum ginger ale drink which is a wise choice ( im so rummy!!!)
The overall quality is ok and it matches the price they charge
The staff are always friendly and polite
To me it is a nearby weekend eat out and I'll try it more for sure!"}
{"text":"I dropped by this place with low expectations(slow service, bad food). I left this place wanting more!! The serve was not only quick but always with a smile. The hostess was like a family member making you feel right at home. My girlfriend and I ordered burgers which where delightful!! The portions where just right and the cooking on my pattie was on point(grilled well on the outside and pink on the inside!!). Later we had desert and once again it was great! Amazing even! Everything was served with a smile and served quickly! I was so happy I left a 30% tip! I highly recommend this place after or before watching a movie at Marche Central!!"}
{"text":"I'd give it four stars especially for the number of times I  went there over the years and the friendly staff but for my sister's b day which also happens to be mine! The waiter sucked! Charged us a 1$ fee each without our knowledge, wasn't friendly, nor attentive, we felt embarrassed in front of our guests and also the food that day was subpar and usually it isn't!"}
{"text":"I went to Roasters for a paint nite. Service was pretty bad- it seems like the staff have no idea what is going on amongst themselves. We walked over to the bar, nobody was there to serve us, a few waiters even walked by without saying anything.

The quality of food was good- we ordered a full rack of ribs and a side of macaroni and cheese (their signature side). House wines are half off for happy hour ($4.50 for 6 oz and $7.50 for 9 oz).

I would not come to this venue, unless I really had to kill some post shopping/ movie date hunger. Hold the check- drive to town."}
{"text":"I went there to have diner with my husband and, although the food was good, the service was pretty bad. My husband has a bit of a speech problem and when he ordered his food (in English) the waitress said to him in French that she didn't understand him after which she continued to speak to us in French and being kind of rude, while she spoke English with the couple sitting at the next table."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Chicken is OK, prices are in the midrange. Service is slow, so if you're in a rush for lunch let them know. We came as a big group for a birthday lunch and we were in and out in 2 hours which is unacceptable. It wasn't even busy either. 
The roast beef sandwich au jus was delicious however.  Crispy fried onions and melted cheese over beef will win me over every time."}
{"text":"Dropped by this place to have a quick bite before heading off to Guzzo next door for a movie. I was famished and I went with a no thrill selection of a half-chicken with some fries and some Rickard's White because why not, this is a Rotisserie after all right? The chicken must be good...

AND IT WAS! YEY!!!

Within 15 minutes, my chicken arrived and literally hopped into my mouth in the most hospitable fashion. I already had my Rickard's White at hands mere minutes after I ordered to help me wash this great chicken down.

Moist and tender this chicken was as a ravaged through my meals under the eyes of friends. The fries were done just right and came with an amazing bun (you know, not those cheap ones you get from St-Hubert) and sauce.

Minutes later, I left satisfied and enjoyed the rest of the evening.

The price tag is solid and the service was as well though I'd state some of the skirts were a bit too short for the conservative types but hey, I won't complain.

I'm not conservative in the least."}
{"text":"Chicken was dry and plain. I wouldn't be calling this restaurant one of my favourites. But the price wasn't very expensive! Poutine and french fries were good! 
Best part of these restaurants is not the food, but the bar! They have a very nice bar. It's better to enjoy this place more for a drink then a meal !!!!
It is good place to eat at night"}
{"text":"En lisant les autres commentaires, je ne sais pas si je me suis trompée de lieu ou si le monde aime vraiment ce genre de bouffe, parce qu'on ne peut certainement pas appeler ça de la nourriture! C'est une offence à la cuisine!
Sur 3 burgers commandés, les 3 étaient trop cuits, les steaks étaient épais, presque noirs et partaient en boulettes. Je cherche encore les champignons de mon burger aux champignons, la sauce n'avait pas de goût, la salade verte et tomate sans goût, sans sel ni poivre... Quelle arnaque! De la mal bouffe véritable, j'ai eu mal au ventre pendant tout le film au cinéma d'à côté et ai dû quitter la salle. Beurk!"}
{"text":"The seating area for this restaurant and the service was pretty good. The food though, at least from what I got was just ok. I ordered the chicken tenders poutine and it ended up being disappointing. Kind of on the small side portion wise, especially if you're really hungry and the chicken was a bit dry. Probably should've got one of the burgers or the ribs as it was apparently better. I don't know about the bar but overall this place is just ok."}
{"text":"Waitress and host were very nice. However the burger was terrible. I couldn't finish it. Over priced and disgusting. 17$ wasted."}
