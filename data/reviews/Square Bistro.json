{"text":"Very nice place, the service was great Evan was very attentive and helpful. The tour of Italy was excellent and the braised short ribs over squash ravioli was tasty but not satisfying, only because the person next to me had ordered sushi. Then I wanted to change my order. The only item that was disappointing was the black bean egg rolls, they were lacking filling. Two at $9.00. Over all very good, will be back."}
{"text":"We've been here several times. Absolutely love it!!! Seating up and down. They have a bar. What's not to love about this little gourmet type restaurant. Do yourself a favor and check it out. You will not be disappointed at all!!!!!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians Beware

They do a poor job editing menu items for Vegetarians.
I have twice received food with meat in it after requesting the dish be prepared without.

If you're not a Vegetarian this shouldn't be a problem I guess.
I'm not one of those obnoxious Vegetarian types and I understand that people make mistakes. This place has made mistakes two of the three times I have ordered meals there.

Drinks are a little over-priced in my opinion.
Bar service isn't that great.

The atmosphere seems confused.
Is it trying to be an up-scale cocktail lounge?
A family restaurant?
A sports bar?
It's not quite and somehow all of these things simultaneously."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch after visiting Holden Arboretum. This is a cute restaurant on the Square. The food we ordered was fresh and well prepared. The menu has many healthy choices as well as a nice selection of beer and wine. Also, a very nice wait staff."}
{"text":"First time here, definitely won't be the last. Decided to check it out after looking up their menu online and walked in on this Tuesday night to find out it is lobster night! 2 courses for 20 bucks? Yes please! I had the bisque and the lobster tail and I have to say it was the best tail I've had in a long time! Perfectly cooked! Broccolini was the veg and it was seasoned perfectly! My husband enjoyed his surf and turf, cleaning his plate! Dana, our server, was awesome and the General Manager Bryce is super cool! Great meal, great deal! Happy to know this is only a few miles from my house. Delish!"}
{"text":"I had read mixed review about Square Bistro, but decided to give it a try. So glad we did because my husband and I absolutely loved it! The restaurant is pretty small and when we first walked in the host told us it would be a half hour wait. However, within just a few minutes he came back and told us he reconfigured some seats and ended up seating us right away. I ordered a great martini from the menu, but can't remember the name (had grapefruit). Then, my husband had the Asian beef vegetable soup of the day and it was really good. Not much of an Asian flavor to it, but still good. I ordered the mussels in a coconut curry broth and the watermelon salad. Both were ridiculously delicious. The watermelon was perfectly ripe and the pistachios added a nice texture. The coconut curry broth was amazing and I wish I had more bread to dunk!  Also, the portion of mussels was huge, much bigger than most restaurants. My husband had the calamari pasta which he really enjoyed. We will be back, hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"The food was ok,  but not as good as the first time. The service was terrible.
If this had been our first visit,  we would never even consider going back. 
We had to ask to order drinks,  never got refills. She was slow and not friendly. Oh,  and even when I explicitly told her I wanted my tuna raw, it came out cooked. 
We may try again,  but not for a while."}
{"text":"Ate at square bistro for the first time Saturday. Happened upon the place even though I live in the Chardon area. Outstanding ahi tuna...fresh multigrain bread and herb butter....clam chowder and onion soups were perfect. The wine was an ample pour...the Pinot Grigio a decent selection. Our server was very good...attentive. The close proximity of the tables takes away from the ambience....however...I frequently travel to DC and Chicago...and oftentimes I am physically touching the next tables occupants...but an idea is to reconfigure. I definitely will be back for more! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and service was good.  We got sat by the door, ever time the door opened we froze and it seems no one knows how to use a shovel out front.  The stairs were full of snow and the sidewalk in front was full of snow. I had to go next door the next day and it was still full of snow so be careful"}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks, but they told me my to go order would be ready in 10 minutes and it actually took 30. :( Also love the date night option."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with my husband. We loved the food. I ordered the special which was swordfish. It was prepared perfectly. My husband ordered a burger, rare, which he loved (he's picky about his burgers!!)  Our server Dillan was very friendly and attentive. It's hard to find restaurants where you can find great food AND service. We look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, food has been great every time I order with a wide variety. Location is awesome right on the Chardon Square. Service is always great at the bar. Price is where it should be."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious and perfect portions!  I highly recommend the ahi sushi tacos! Didn't know what to expect and was in town for business.  I'm happy I found this little gem in Chardon.  Great atmosphere and great service!!"}
{"text":"Wow- as others have stated this is true gourmet food! Amazing chef and menu!!

I wish I could give it a 5 but the only thing preventing that was the extremely rude waitress!
Eye rolling when we asked questions, snotty and even dropped the food- didn't apologize and didn't replace it.  The most shocking behavior I've ever seen from a wait staff in all my years between LA and Miami! If you want to avoid her she was working an afternoon on a Wednesday if memory serves."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour. The truffle fries are amazing. Might be the best deal in Geauga County!"}
{"text":"Always a great meal here.  If you haven't been here in awhile, they opened another dining area on the lower level so it is easier to get in for dinner on the weekend. Menu changes seasonally.  Traditional american cuisine plus sushi.  Definitely call in advance for a reservation."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and service attentive. However, do not sit any place but on the main floor. The small upstairs room is crowded and noisy from the kitchen fans."}
{"text":"Phenomenal place, especially for lobster, and it really captures the quaint historic feel of downtown Chardon.  Make reservations if you're going because it's usually packed because of the great food. I've never had a bad meal here, definitely worth the trip to Chardon to walk around the square and then, well, go to Square!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out, and finally did this evening with my boyfriend. The bar was the first thing I noticed, because it was lit from within. Very cool. The atmosphere felt upscale, especially as compared with other restaurants in the area. 

I had a pomegranate bellini, which was a delicious before-dinner drink, and my bf had a Left Hand 400 Pound Monkey (IPA) which he liked. 

For dinner, he had a \"Square\" burger. It had bacon jam, a fried egg, L&T, and cheese on a pretzel bun and came with rosemary and sea salt fries. 8/10.

I had a pirogi meal which was covered in braised beef, onion and peppers. Since I'd checked the menu online before, and decided that's what I'd get a full 5 hours before, I had big expectations. The dish did not disappoint! 9/10 and I really have no reason not to give it 10/10 besides the fact that I feel like I shouldn't give a perfect score for food unless it makes me cry tears of joy or amazement. 

Our server Dillan was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"The menu is all over the place. I expected a bistro menu and that is not what I got. Mostly an Asian inspired menu. I ordered the Ramen Bowl and didn't like the flavors or texture. The waitress allowed me to order the stir fry. It was hard to find the veggies in this dish. And the flavors were just ok. My daughter liked her gyro and French onion soup. The service was definitely lacking. Not a place I will rush back to for lunch."}
{"text":"Nice and quaint little restaurant. After three visits, I would say that the food is very inconsistent at times and the wait staff is not usually app to address the issue themselves. It's ok for Chardon's poor selection, but would rate it lower on the pack compared to others. 

I had the street tacos there last time and they were mostly fat and not tasty, I was informed they can't control the cut of meat. That's a problem if the chef can't control what they cook. 

We have not been back since, but if you're looking for something new, it might not kill you. Prices are high, drinks were their only highlight. Seating is tight, get there early."}
{"text":"All I can say is this place is awesome. We live on the opposite side of Geauga County and heard about this place from a friend. I travel extensively around the Midwest on business and this restaurant is as good as anywhere I've been.  Literally each course of food was perfect, and they had an excellent craft beer selection. I would say their wines by the glass are average at best but that was the one and only weak area, however the nine dollar glass of Cabernet my wife had was acceptable for the money. 

We started off with the French onion soup and a yellowtail sushi roll  both of which were excellent. I had the prime rib sandwich and she had the fried fish sandwich both which were very tasty. Crazy enough the highlight was the french fries, while I am not a french fry guy, these are the best french fries I ever ever had anywhere.  We finished it up with a gluten-free chocolate cake, with maple ice cream on top berries and whip cream which was very delicious. 

The staff was very very nice, and they were ready for our reservation even though we were five minutes early. We will be back, Greenlight go for sure!"}
{"text":"We were in town for the Maple Festival that was held on the square. 

Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. Given the unique menu, I do wish she would have walked us through it.  The restaurant has a Japanese menu as well as a Bistro menu. 

We started with the chicken skin app. I have never felt as gluttonous but it was so delicious. Chicken skins dredged and fried. Crispy yummy perfect. 

We both had the special which was a surf and turf.  A 6oz filet with your choice of surf, which we both picked the butter poached lobster. Everything about it was executed perfectly. The lobster was perfectly cook...its hard to get a tail that isn't overdone. The filet was cooked to our desired temp of medium rare, it had a great char. Sides were chefs pick and tonight it was garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli. 

The atmosphere was extremely loud and we could barely hear each other, this really killed the ambiance of our date night. Maybe on a less crowded night it would be better?"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here with another couple for dinner on a Monday night. We thought the food was pretty hit or miss. My wife's salmon burger was very good. It was seasoned well and not dry which is common with salmon burgers. 
    The banh mi sandwich was not very good. The generic \"Asian\" flavor on the pork tasted mostly like soy sauce and teriyaki and the roll felt like a \"brown and serve\" roll that wasn't browned but only par baked. The roll was cut all the way through which even minimum wage subway sandwich artists know not to do. This made the small pieces of pork and pickled veggies fall out as you try to eat it. I ended up eating it with a fork. 
   I can over look this as relatively minor but all of the sides we ordered were so bland it seemed impossible that there was a chef in the kitchen. I ordered the French onion soup which is one of their daily soups. It was so unbelievably bad that I can't imagine how they can serve it. They clearly just buy canned beef broth and try to dress it up with some dried herbs to make you think it is homemade (which would be strained if you actually made it from scratch). When you bite into the dried herbs you get a very nasty pop of bitterness that is hard to bear. The thing that really killed the soup though was the COMPLETE lack of salt. I am very sensitive to salt and I really do not like overly salted foods but this soup was so bland it was crazy. It literally had no flavor which is simply not possible if you make your broth from scratch with any level of skill. 
    Our \"fingerling potato salad\" was along the same lines, NO SALT. How can you serve potatoes with no salt?? It's impossible that anyone in the kitchen is tasting anything that goes out of the kitchen. 
     I don't think we will return anytime soon. This is a shame because they have a great spot, an awesome bar, beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! The chef is awesome and puts a nice twist on some classics (bacon wrapped meatloaf) and has created some originals that will soon become classics! The atmosphere is great for date night with the significant other but probably not a great place for kids. Staff had always be friendly."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Accommodating to my vegetarian diet. I ordered the square burger, minus the burger and add extra cheese. The waitress took off $3 and it was very good! Best truffle fries I've had in awhile. Very peaceful patio on the square. I would give five stars if they had a vegetarian burger patty. Also, the menu font and print was hard to read for two of my older friends."}
{"text":"Heard so many good things about Square Bistro we went for lunch yesterday, February 19th. My wife and I walked on, went up to hostess station, a young lady walked up, no smile, no greeting, asked how many, just two words, started walking to a table, didn't say follow me . We walked to table , she set down menu's and walked away without so word. We should bs do walked out at that point. Waitress came over, got our drink order, then we ordered. I ordered the barbecue pork sandwich, my wife the soup and salad. The pork on my sandwich was dried out, little sauce on it. I had to ask for extra sauce. My wife said she didn't taste much salad dressing on her salad. To say we were unhappy is an understatement. By the way the uninterested hostess sat at the bar the  whole time we were at lunch doing some kind of paper work. We won't be back and I am sure they could care less."}
{"text":"What a great new place in Chardon. Great atmosphere, great beer and priced right!  12 micro beers on tap and new ones coming in all the time. Food looks great but haven't eaten here yet. Courtney is awesome at the bar! Finally a late night place in Chardon other than the Bev (nothing wrong with Bev!)  Stop in, great place!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Square Bistro a half dozen times in the last six months.   Each time I enjoy the food and atmosphere.  I will depart from the normal for a moment and tell you to get the \"death by peanut butter\" dessert.   Truly magnificent.    The spicy crab salad & nachos are wonderful .     They have tasty sushi, salmon, and burgers.   Do yourself a favor and try this out.   They have different flavored butter and whole grain bread with each dinner."}
{"text":"First time here. Great ambiance from the tin ceiling to the wood bar. There's also a small patio facing Chardon square. I had the fish tacos and french onion soup. Both were amazing. They have a pretty good sushi selection too, so I can't wait to try it. Don't get me wrong, they are not a seafood restaurant.  They have appetizers, tacos, sandwiches, steaks, seafood, ravioli, jambalaya and more. And I'm very picky about my coffee.  Not only was their coffee good, they serve it with real cream. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really good spot, gone a couple times, always good, great beer list. I've liked everything I've tried."}
{"text":"As many others have commented, the atmosphere is loud.  We were there on a Tuesday in March night and every time the door opened, a giant fan blew cold air into the restaurant.  The restaurant was not crowded, service was prompt, however entrees arrived when we were still working on appetizers.  I had crab cake benedict - very good, and tuna - which had no flavor.  My wife had lobster bisque - excellent and lobster mac and cheese - OK.  Very nice selection of beers.  Overall, not worth the price."}
{"text":"We have dined here 3 times now and absolutely love it. The restaurant is small and a bit noisy but the service, food and pricing is fantastic. 

Square Bistro has weekly specials that are really worth the trip and the food is well prepared and so much better than you would experience at a chain restaurant. 

Chardon FINALLY has a gourmet restaurant that won't hurt your wallet. A must try!!!"}
{"text":"First time we came here the food was excellent but on our next visit the menu had changed and the food was not very good.  My friend has acid reflux and could not find anything to eat.  Everything was spicy.  The decor is very nice but due to the ceiling it was loud in there."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here as we just moved to Chardon.  

We went on a Monday night and it is taco night but we decided tonight was sushi night as we missed our normal sushi place.  

Everything was phenomenal!!  

Without a doubt it was the best sushi we have ever had!  

I ordered the Baconator, Chardon Roll and my go to Philly roll.  The Smoke Salmon was out of this world!  By far the most flavorful and fresh salmon in a Philly roll I have ever had!  This is the first time I didn't have to drown my sushi in wasabi, soy sauce and ginger!  My husband was shocked that I was eating them without anything.  

The ginger was amazing!  It actually tasted like ginger and not vinegar soaked mush!  The wasabi is very strong and not for the weak!  The guy at the table next to us also ordered the Baconator but the Thai Chili was too much for him and his buddies picked on him that he had just been outdone by a girl!  

My husband ordered the maple old fashioned!  WOW!  It was also amazing!  I found my long island to be a little weak for the price but it was still very good in flavor!  

We will definitely be going back for more!  

I booked our reservation on their website 45 minutes prior to ensure we would get a table.  The website is nicely done and very easy to navigate.  

If you are in the area this is a must go to place!"}
{"text":"We have just moved into the area and heard about the Square Bistro. We finally tried it for lunch and were quite impressed with the decor, food and staff. The craft beer tap selection was good and very nice to see a rotating tap list. The burger was juicy and flavorful and the wraps and salads were fresh and uniquely seasoned. Menu looked inviting. We will be back soon and hope to hit dinner soon.  Well worth the visit you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I made reservation for 7 at Square bistro through their website and did not have a problem making that reservation. Had I known they were going to put it upstairs I might have requested a different table. We had one server for the upstairs and that girl was running ragged. It's about 15 minutes to get my first beer but that wasn't only problem. As we were upstairs they installed one of those Hotel Style HVAC units in the wall to accommodate 4 the right ventilation on a second level. As you could see out over the first level a lot of the heat and humidity came upstairs. Problem is that when they turn that unit on it was almost too good for the area because it froze my ass out of there. And then when you ask them to turn it off it turns back into a sauna so the only solution is to move to another table where you're not sitting right in front of the jet blast of cold air and therefore you cannot enjoy your meal. That coupled with we were set Nest to away another rather large party who wore knuckle deep into their drinks and it was exceptionally loud. Like deafening. We are unable to have any sort of conversation. I am not a sushi person but they do have sushi style rolls with filet in them one of them is a tempura roll and the other one is some sort of sirloin roll either way it was delicious but the whole meal experience is kind of ruined X slow service and sitting in the refrigerator."}
{"text":"My first time here and wanted a light dinner. The onion soup was awesome along with the kale salad. Can't wait to come back hungry and try the pecan crusted salmon"}
{"text":"Good on every level, come in early though to get a table, beer selection is above par and food quality is real good!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience, food was very good, service was excellent, bartender(Courtney) was outstanding. Will definitely do a return trip"}
{"text":"5 stars for the amazing deal they call \"date night\" on Wednesday.

For $45 you gets 2 starters, 2 entree, and 2 desserts. Aka Date Night.

There are a few choices for each course to choose from.

It's not the best meal I've ever had, but for $45 it was the best bargain. 

I left very happy and full"}
{"text":"This was our first visit. The shrimp and grits were very tasty. I ordered the tour of Italy, I found that the cooked veggies were over cooked and soggy causing them to be very slimy feeling. The bread was soggy and mushy because of this. My husband got the porky pig. The first couple of bites were good, then the Cole slaw over took everything and we could taste nothing but the sweet slaw. All in all, it wasn't a very memorable experience. I don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"As a longtime Chardon-area resident, I am used to driving to Willoughby, Cleveland, Woodmere and other 20-50 minute drives for this sort of atmosphere and quality.

Square Bistro has a hip and urban feel with it's lighted bar, decor and impressive wine and tap list.  It has delicious food and a great happy hour with good deals on \"tapas\" style small plates.  The pork tacos, chicken wings and asiago fries were all fantastic and I was salivating over some of the entrees I saw.

I've been twice in the short time it's been open and plan on many more visits. This area has sorely lacked a place like this and I hope the community will support it.  Thankfully it has looked relatively busy on both of my visits."}
{"text":"Update: returned for a full dinner on a Friday night. Was a hot day, but sat downstairs this time and it was very warm and very loud. Huge difference between up/downstairs in re: to noise. You sit very close to other tables, so difficult to hear conversion, but in their defense - it was a full house. Just don't expect a quiet evening. 

Ordered sushi and the new spicy tuna nachos. Nachos were good, but not what you'd expect. It's  a spicy tuna \"purée\" (I know that's not the right name, but it's the best way I can describe it) with chips on the side. I've had this at other restaurants, but the waitress always clarifies that it's not \"nachos\" like you'd expect. May be something for the staff to let patrons know? 

I had the filet and it was amazing. Husband had the ahi tuna and he said it was fantastic. Took over an hour to get our dinner, but thankfully we had two apps to help. We would return again ..."}
{"text":"WOW! We had SUCH an amazing dinner here. It was a special occasion so we went all out. We started with the sushi appetizer special of the day, which was thai peanut shrimp - incredible. INCREDIBLE! Fresh, delicious, and the flavors were perfectly balanced. We also had the pierogis, which were so delicious, and the dough was done just right, not too chewy or too soft. For my entree I got the surf and turf: filet mignon and lobster tail. Holy smokes was this good. The filet was cooked perfectly, medium rare all the way through, and the perfect level of char on top.And who doesn't love lobster? The potatoes and asparagus that it came with were lovely. We were way too full from dinner to have dessert, this time.. Next time we're coming for the dessert list! One note: The manhattan could be stronger."}
{"text":"This place is an A- for its locale, but a C+ for the upscale Cleveland market generally. Crowd is kind of County Fair-ish, disappointing immature staff, and decidedly spotty food. Grossly overcooked tasteless calamari, bland lobster bisque loaded with butter and lobster meat but no dry sherry in the house ! Excellent fish entrees and dessert of forgettable sorbet. Seems like the cook has big ideas but support is just unprofessional and a little unprepared. I don't need to drive out from Pepper Pike with better options closer."}
{"text":"This was a great spot to take my dad for a belated Father's Day celebration. Rather than cash out the big bucks on the day of, we opted to wait until Thursday night to go to Square Bistro. By the way, if you weren't aware on Thursdays at Square Bistro they have Prime Rib Night!!! Out of the 5 person reservation, 4 ordered it and devoured it - but not in one sitting. The leftovers were just as great. I was the silly one who ordered something other than the prime rib deal. However, my meal was just as tasty of a deal. I had the duck, and it was a nice change of pace. I'm so used to only eating Asian style duck that this was a good switch up. It didn't scare me away quite like how duck l'orange did back in the day!

Overall, the experience was truly gourmet. Which is shocking considering how far off into the boonies this place is. If you're looking for a more location friendly place, Square Bistro is a sister to the Lure Bistro in Willoughby (which I have also been and you can read a review of)."}
{"text":"Listened to complaints and followed diligently, great to see this establishment improve itself, encourage everyone in Geauga County to try out this amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice little Bistro for lunch.  The food was excellent.  I was there with a friend for lunch and it was quiet and cozy.  We each had a salad and then split a flourless chocolate cake that was Delicious!  We'll go again. ."}
{"text":"This is a great find.   I was in the mood for something that was out of the ordinary on my one day trip to Chardon and Square did not disappoint.  Have the ramen noodle bowl."}
{"text":"The menu reminded me of J Alexander's from Columbus. It had an Asian flare with the same font on the menu. It was a quaint, village style restaurant and we had to wait about 20 minutes. My husband and daughter had a noodle soup - hers with chicken and his with shrimp. My daughter had vegetarian tacos. Her friend had salmon tacos. I had their burger with a house salad. My husband said the broth had a lot of flavor. He devoured it quickly. My daughter took some soup home. The tacos went fast. My burger was okay. Way too much sauce and I missed it had bacon in it. I don't do meat on meat. It was fine but I wished I did the soup. Would Definitely have done the soup instead. For dessert I did the expresso pot de crepe which alone was worth the visit. My husband and daughter and my older daughter and her friend each shared a peanut butter dessert that was rich and delicious."}
{"text":"Another good meal, food is always great. This time we sat by the windows. A bit more quiet and much less server traffic, I was pleased with that."}
{"text":"I have been to square bistro three times and was impressed and happy with my experience when i went for lunch. The french onion soup was delicious as well as the caesar salad. However I recently ordered take out sushi because they recently started serving sushi and I thought I'd give it a try since I've heard good things about it. I would say that I wasn't blown away and that it wasn't worth the price of their sushi.. My takeout was also sitting on the bar upon arrival and I guess it wasn't sitting there long but I wish they would have kept it refrigerated because what if I got stuck in traffic? The presentation was also off but that may be because I ordered take out :/"}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant for a nice dinner in Chardon.  The food is always good and creative with a regularly changing menu and the wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive.  Their happy hour is fantastic but you'd better get there early as the happy hour specials are only good at the bar and it tends to fill up early."}
{"text":"Been there twice. The food is great. I am looking forward to dining there again. The locally sourced food is great. I love a place that uses local and cooks it well."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and always enjoyed it. Tonight I got the 20 dollar special with the fish tacos which were great but then I got the shrimp stir fry which had sticky rice no vegetables  and 4 shrimp and a horrible overly sweet sauce. It was terrible"}
{"text":"We heard about this place and decided to try it out. The happy hour prices on food are reasonable, so we were able to try a number of items. Everything was just okay. Nothing impressive."}
{"text":"My first time
visit won't be my last. Our waiter, Shon, was
pleasant, professional and very attentive. The manager checked on our experience and everything was perfect! Great atmosphere! Good food! we WILL be back!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times. The sushi is really good and the portions are huge.  The atmosphere is small-town friendly. There are three floors. I'd recommend trying if you haven't already."}
