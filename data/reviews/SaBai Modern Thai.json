{"text":"I've only been here once, got the Jalepano curry. I've had curry from a couple other Thai places in the valley - this tasted very different, really salty and watery without the curry flavor I was expecting. The meat and veggies didn't look or taste fresh either. I ended up tossing it after a few bites. I also got an iced Thai Coffee, which was pretty much the same as every other Thai restaurant I've been to, maybe a little on the sweeter side."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch one afternoon and found they had some great lunch special. Everything on the menu sounded so good I had trouble deciding what to get. I haven't eaten a lot of Thai dishes, but I found every thing to be easy to understand and delicious sounding. I ended up getting a garlic chicken dish and it was on point. All the ingredients looked and tasted fresh. The vegetables weren't overcooked and still had a crispness to them. The egg roll I got on the side was great. The portion size is large. I would have taken a box to go for the rest of my food, but I was in walking distance to home and didn't want to carry it with me. My server was super busy and she held it all together magnificently.  I will definitely be back to try something else. Their lunch specials are great price, so it is a good time to check them out. They were also super busy the day I was in. People were waiting at the bar for tables to open up. The place is small, but has a modern comfy feel to it. I like it here."}
{"text":"Found it okay okay. The menu items were more or less what you expect from a Thai place."}
{"text":"The food is less then ok, the Soup I got was gross! The service is ok but slow.  The food made me sick almost instantly! I will not come here again ever!!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout, since I was staying in a nearby hotel. The Pad Thai, Thai Rolls, and Spicy Fried Rice were all too spicy to eat. Obviously, since I ordered a dish with Spicy in the name, I was expecting some heat, but ordering a medium-level spice made for inedible food. Behind the spice, there were odd flavors of sweet and sour, certainly not traditional Thai flavors. With delivery fee and tip, I'm out $40 when only about 10 total bites could be taken."}
{"text":"This is my second time at SaBai. The first was for dinner; this time was for lunch. I was very impressed both times by the ambiance, the service, and most importantly, the food. This restaurant was started by a young local couple and they really seem to know what they are doing. They obviously put their heart into their business and care about the customers.

For dinner, I had the Prik King with chicken. It was incredibly flavorful  and the portion size required me to take some to go. The spice level was exactly where I requested.

For the lunch, I had the Jalapeño curry. This has all the warm comfort of an excellent curry, but it has a fantastic accent of jalapeño with it. The flavors are robust, balanced, and they intrigue throughout the entire meal. Some Thai food is great for the first few bites, but then you want a new flavor because it only has one bold flavor that tends to overwhelm. The  dishes at SaBai are all complex enough to keep your taste buds engaged in the eating process for the entire meal. That is a really strange way of putting it, but it is the best I can do! By the way, my friend had the spicy noodles for her lunch and she loved them.

I will be back and I will try another new dish!"}
{"text":"Food was good and they don't hold back on the spice like other places. I had the eggplant/broccoli; a minor detail is that the dish is stuffed with carrots and onions too (more than eggplant or broccoli). The flavor was good tough. The only service issue was the 50 minute wait for 3 dishes, which is not acceptable. It seemed like everyone around us was just waiting."}
{"text":"They took over the old Wendy's-turned-taco-joint in force!  Tasty, fresh thai. Favorites are the coconut martini and massaman curry with beef short ribs. They have a great neighborhood vibe."}
{"text":"highly disappointed....not by the quality of the food, but by the accuracy. i ordered spicy fried rice w/ chicken to go. how one would mistaken \"noodles\" for \"fried rice\" i have no idea, but for the price, i'd at least expect my order to be accurate. strike 1. fyi, i never give places a chance for strike 3. hope the next time they get my order right."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, good ambiance. Pricey a little bit but food is amazing. I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Had dinner and some appetizers here last night.  The flavors in our entrees were spot on and so fresh and refreshing. We tried the spring rolls as appetizers ( they tasted frozen) and that was the only complaint I had. The pot of clams in white whine broth, home run! There is a ginger Martini on the menu I recommend!!"}
{"text":"I hate to review based on one experience but I will not be returning. Maybe if I lived closer, I would give another try. This was not a pleasant chill experience.  We started with the crab won-tons and frankly did not like them, the flavor was as if the cream cheese was left out too long and I hated the addition (even though it was a drop) of sriracha sauce on top. Then the soup, a Thai staple, Tom Yum, the broth tasted like sugar was copiously mixed into it. Too sweet for my palate. For entrées we had the basil classic and the sai bai fried rice, both were just very bland nothing to remember . And last but not least I like to rock out with best of them and I admit the music that was playing was aces but way too loud. The service was OK but almost awkward, definitely was missing that certain appeal that can make or break a restaurant.  It seemed like the bar patrons were front center and the restaurant took a back seat but I usually don't go to Thai places to get my drink on. Wished it was better."}
{"text":"Rip Off on Delivery.  Ordered $18 of food was told $20 was minimum for delivery. Changed order to $20.  Order arrives its plus $5 for delivery which wasn't communicated on phone or menu.  .  So original $18 order is now at $26-27 with tax.   never again and haven't tried food.  WAIT just tried to eat food.  consistency of rubber. There was ONE piece of shrimp in the chicken and shrimp Pad Thai. TOTAL RIP OFF FOR REALLY BAD FOOD

{"text":"Just a quick review to get the ball rolling. Popped in here on opening night, and was pleasantly surprised. Hubby and I split the Mussaman, a hearty portion of curried veggies and short-ribs, and the Garlic Veggies with tofu. The Mussaman was by far the star, and given it's $16 entree price it needed to be. I see a lot of promise here, though I do find the prices to be rather high for this neighborhood. I should hope once they get their liquor license (expected sometime in January according to the waitress) that the food prices will come down. I'm not holding my breath on this one, however, since the moniker \"Modern Thai\" has become euphemism for \"Expensive Thai.\" I look forward to trying SaBai again after they've had some time to coalesce."}
{"text":"Reviews have the stereotype that only those who have incredible or absolutely horrible experiences will leave a review. I guess I'm in the middle of the road leaving a review having had numerous good experiences at SaBai but one bad one that will likely keep me from returning.

I live relatively close and we've ordered takeout from here quite a few times. We were initially impressed with the generous portions (I could make one dish serve as two meals and that says a lot) and the great flavor. They're very quick too! Pad Thai is my go-to dish.  The Mussaman is great too. 

Over the last 6-12 months, I've become less inclined to frequent SaBai. This is due to dwindling portions (which I was okay with to a point) and some poorly prepped meals: shrimp still cold, irregular levels of spice (I go medium), and had one that seemed like they accidentally dumped some sweet fish sauce in my pad Thai. 

Well, it came to a head when I picked up dinner earlier this week. I get home and the container for my pad Thai is relatively empty. I'd say it was about 60% of a normal portion. I called SaBai to ask if this portion sounded right (they had been reducing the portions after all) and they agreed it did not. The individual I talked to said he put my name on \"the list\" and my next Pad Thai would be free. Great! It didn't satiate my hunger for that evening but I definitely felt better about the experience. 

Fast forward to this evening. My wife decides to pick up dinner coming back from work.  She arrives and explains the situation only to be told by the manager that she was there when I called to question the portion size. (So, she was there when the guy told me that I'd be getting a free meal.) But, that doesn't matter. She said that she packed it and it was a normal portion. (I guess I'm lying then.)  She then suggested that,\"Maybe it was a different container (it wasn't) and I just thought it was a smaller portion.\" My wife rebutted with the fact that the manager just said she packed it herself (supposedly) so shouldn't she know if it was a different container. The manager then goes on to say that the person I spoke to was a delivery boy and had no authority to give me a free meal. (I guess that's my fault.). My wife was tired from her 12-hour shift so she just paid and left. 

The pad Thai tonight was one of the better ones I've had from there in a while. It just adds to the frustration because I don't see myself going back there."}
{"text":"I went there today with a friend and it was overall terrible. Our server had no clue what was on the menu or any recomendations. I had some sushi and the tuna was warm and tasted old. Not to mention the sushi took over twenty five minutes to get. I had a bloody mary and our server said she had no idea how to make one. I think she left out the vodka. I had a shrimp stir fry and it was cold when it came out. The server said it came with noodles, turned out it didnt so i asked for some and was charged for something she said was in it to begin with. Overall it sucked and hope they hire a new server and a quick lunch wouldnt be over an hour long."}
{"text":"I really like the flavor and variety that this restaurant had to offer. I really enjoy coming here for the food and some Thai flare. I recommend it. The only thing I would recommend is serving the curry dishes in different styled bowls. I love knowing I can dip my spoon in a deep bowl of curry and spoon out the goodness onto my plate. Good stuff and great work!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Thai restaurant for years and the only complaint I ever had was depending on who was cooking, would determine your spice level as I always did a level 3 but the spice level would fluctuate...no biggie...
It's been over a year since eating here but Today I grabbed take out. When I got to my destination, I realized that my pad Thai was missing all the toppings (bean sprouts, green onions, crushed peanuts, crispy wontons), had barely any sauce and no spice.
I am so disappointed and have no desire to go back. I recommend double checking your order if it's take out or delivery."}
{"text":"Ordered:

 the SaBai fried rice;

Nothing special.  You could do much better at so many other places with fried rice.  This applies to everything we ate, the seasoning was way off,  lacked salt and flavor.  



The satay
Again nothing special with this dish.  It was okay, the peanut sauce was the best part of the dish 

And the mussalman curry
This was just bad,, off, not good.  I had it with beef, would not order this again.  The only way to describe the problem with the flavor was it was unsalted and somewhat watery.  

Taking this place off my restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"I stopped by tonight based on the other reviews posted here.

The restaurant is nicely decorated with contemporary furniture and decorations. There are some bar height tables as well as some standard height tables. The music was a little loud and the lights were dim.  The bathrooms were nicely appointed and clean but VERY dark. (dear owner - if you are reading this please turn up the lights in the bathroom!)

Now, on to the food.... It is not your typical Thai restaurant menu. (ie red/yellow/green curry with choice of protein, etc...)  I started out with an order of the Crispy Thai Rolls. The rolls were crispy, were served with some sweet sauce and some salad garnish with a light dressing. They had a nice flavor but left my fingers somewhat oily.

I continued with an order of the Spicy Fried Noodle with Chicken, and did not specify how hot. It was very well seasoned  and an at appropriate level of spice. It had some zing, but not too much. I enjoyed the dish very much and look forward to eating the leftovers tomorrow.

Overall I enjoyed the food and look forward to going again to try something new. It is a cut above your typical Thai restaurant and the price reflected that, $16 for my two items."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food and reasonably priced as well. The service is friendly, and the atmosphere is very laid back and casual. Make sure to go in for happy hour. They have some great specials!"}
{"text":"Just about the best Thai food I have had in a long time. Friendly folks, great transformation of a former Wendy's into a graceful restaurant,excellent Thai beer (Chang,) several types of curry dishes but my fave is the green curry seafood....not to be missed....."}
{"text":"We love Sa Bai and have been coming here since they opened, we are very lucky to have such a great place in our neighborhood.

Our server always remembers us, our drinks and what we usually order to eat.  The food is fresh-fresh-fresh.  Everything we have tried is excellent and they are very accomodating to special requests.

We heart Sa Bai and hope they thrive in our neighborhood for many years to come!  We are so happy to support an excellent, independent local restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing! Try the lemongrass eggplant dish. Everything I've had here has been exquisite."}
{"text":"I have never yelped...but this restaurant actually made me pick up my tablet and get an account.  I felt that I needed to protect and warn other thai food lovers in the valley. The New Times gave this restaurant the Best Thai food award last year. Apparently the Phoenix New Times reviwer was either a)paid off  b)on extasy c)held at gunpoint when evaluating the cuisine at this establishment.
     I don't know where to begin, but first lets start with the objective facts that I am full Thai and also brought along 2 Americans who are very familiar with both Thai food and dining out in general.  Now let the story begin......
     The servers were very pleasant and prompt and the establishment  clean and presentable.  When inquiring on what to order our server( also full thai) told me that the special was avocado green curry.  Also she stated that the curry dishes were most definitely \"authentic Thai\", And not some watered down American version.  I was immediately skeptical because there is No such dish made with avocados in thailand.   I opted for the standard chicken green curry.  We also ordered chicken satay and pad prik king with beef.  All are very standard Thai fare and easily available in any Thai restaurant.
     The chicken in both the satay and curry tasted (I kid u not) like flavorless cardboard.  Almost like processed frozen chicken planks that had been boiled in water too long and then put in their respective plates.  It was terrible.  The prik king had a total of 5 small beef morsels and the rest of the dish was filled with vegetable filler!  It wasn't nitpicky..... It was blatant!  Both the curry and the prik king were very spicy...but with Jalapeños!!!  At this point it was laughable and downright insulting to any customer that came to eat Thai food.  Thai chiles are readily available anywhere in the valley and are an essential cornerstone of any Thai restaurants armament of ingredients.
     I just failed to comprehend how this could happen in a supposed \"reputable\" Thai restaurant.  The Thai owner should be ashamed for such an unabashed slap in the face to her Thai culture.
     The ultimate kicker was this however.... When exiting we passed by the kitchen only to see that it was Mexican cooks at the helm!!!!!  wow.. Now it all made sense.... The avocados, the jalapeños, and the Mexican subculture in the kitchen in charge.  maybe this restaurant is going after a whole new cuisine... Thai-Mex fusion!"}
{"text":"Sa Bai - bye bye!!

Very optimistically I tried convincing myself for THREE times that I may have found a good thai place(coz I LOVE thai food) near work, but hey! I give up on this one 

It upsets me that they lack attention to detail, with so so quality food and poor value for my money 

First time - food was delivered to our office but without our beverage although that was charged.  
No sorry no apologies!! I conveniently thought it could be a genuine mistake, so let go!

Second time a take-out order for spicy noodle and all I had was some really hard cooked/caked noodle without any gravy it was so awkward to even eat that. So I requested for some sauce and they charge me for it. OK I thought maybe next time they will be better

Third time it was at the lunch special time. We ordered one chicken dish, one veg dish with soup and salad. I won't complain on this as I was really hungry and ate up everything, somewhere I feel the food tasted good :)
But wait! I asked for a Pad Thai noodle to go and requested to substitute veggies instead of eggs and tofu

When I went home I found the same hard noodles with one ring of zucchini one snap peas and that's all as vegetables, and I paid 8 bucks for this. 
At that moment I knew I'm not going back here!!!!! Ever!!!! Again!!!!!

SaBai - bye bye!!
:( ruled out from my list!! So much for the love for thai food!"}
{"text":"Last week I dropped in with a friend for lunch. The green avocado curry special was so amazing! I had to take it home because the portion was huge. I ordered mild spice, which still had quite the kick. I was happy with that.  I will go back again just for that plate. yummo."}
{"text":"I've never really had a problem with this restaurant until today. 

I often order take out from here.  Always the same thing.

Chicken coconut curry soup, rice and a Thai iced coffee. 
My order is usually correct.  Today however,  what I ordered was not what I received. 
What I received was tom yum soup. Which has tomatoes and no coconut milk. 
I tried correcting the server.  He just kept saying he got it.
Whatever.   I got to work with my lunch and wallah.. it's wrong. .just like I knew it would be.

So I'm stuck with food I don't particularly care for because a server thought he knew best. Yeah right.

So anyone know a good Thai place close to this one? Doesn't matter if they speak English or not since I speak Thai."}
{"text":"Started with a wonderful sweet and sour, a glass of blushing rose, and refreshing cucumber water. I was lucky enough to come during Happy Hour but would have paid full price for everything even if I hadn't.

Comfortable decor, nice atmosphere, and my server (Mariah) was a pleasure. Good food, large portions, and reasonable pricing. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this little restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the real deal, Thai owned and cooked.  Food is amazing and Aroi, and the staff is friendly and authentic as it gets. Only Thai restaurant we visit these days. Better try before there's. Waiting list !"}
{"text":"Went there for  2nd time but this time the old thai screw, ordered a seafood dish and got baby shrimp and small clams or mussles you can buy in a large amount for cheap, new name i have for them, say buy!! 
Wont return, and the server had an attituide, !!"}
{"text":"Bottom line: there's room for improvement but this new little place is off to a great start.

My wife and I finally tried Sa Bai after a good review from a friend. We weren't disappointed. We had two appetizers, two entrees, and dessert. The appetizers were good but not great - the crab wontons were tasty but a little too saucy for me; the crispy thai rolls were a bit generic - a little oily, lacking some in flavor.

However, the main dishes more than made up for this. We had the pad prik king, and pad see-iew. Wow! Both were flavorful and perfectly spiced - not overwhelming, just enough to enhance the flavors and give a little kick. We both really, really liked these dishes. 

Deserts were again good but not overwhelmingly awesome. The prices are reasonable, moreso if you get the happy hour pricing on drinks and appetizers. Service was excellent, btw. Friendly and timely.

We will definitely be coming back to SaBai, and look forward to working our way through more of the menu."}
{"text":"Felt ill after eating here and my friend said maybe the food or cleanliness (or lack thereof)  made me ill, so I looked them up on the Maricopa County Restaurant site to see how they do on inspections.  PRETTY awful.  In fact, their last inspection said it was the 3rd CONSECUTIVE time inspectors found them keeping food at the wrong temperatures and that can make people sick.  Oh, and they also don't keep their sanitizer at proper levels so when they wipe surfaces, they just spread germs around.   YUK!  Look them up for yourself.  
https://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/business_search.aspx?as_page_title=Food%20Establishments%20Search&as_type=Food     I won't be back."}
{"text":"So I am a thai food enthusiast, especially when i travel. At least one meal out of my trip is saved for thai food specifically. However, with no access to a car this time, delivery was of the utmost important to me, especially when i'm sick like today.

i was exceptionally happy when i found this restaurant on yelp, & punched in my address & voila! They do delivery. Because i have dietary restrictions, I called in my order to avoid the confusion of being over/undercharged for my substitutions.  The girl I spoke to was very polite & friendly, which is the only reason this restaurant got a second star. She took my order, got my form of payment, and said the delivery will arrive in about 15-20 minutes.

A few minutes later a different number with a different area code calls me, so I answer:
me: hello?
guy: hi... uhhh... you *mumbles* sabaimodernthai?
me: im sorry?
guy: you just ORDERED from sabai modern thai yeahhh?
me: yes i did
guy: uhhh... can i get your address again?
(at this point i should've hung up.. because thats sketchy move #1)
me: i told the girl who i ordered through, *address*
guy: uhh... whattt? i dont even... i dunno where that is. i mean... yeahhhh i dont go there.
me: excuse me? im sorry, the girl i just ordered through got my address the first time around, and said it would be delivered in about 20 minutes. why is this a problem now? can I please speak to her again?
guy: *yelling at the cooks* CANCEL THAT! CANCEL THAT ORDER!... no that one's ok... no CANCEL THAT ONE... uhmm... yeah i don't drive that far... sooo I can't do that.
me: *frustrated* can you PLEASE put the girl I spoke to earlier back on the phone
*guys shouting at the girl & the girl comes on*
girl: hi im so sorry but I placed your order not realizing that its out of our area, so we actually cant take it that far. you could come pick it up, but we cant deliver it to your address.
me: ok thank you please refund my card
girl: we're in the process of doing that right now
me: great thank you

Im not sure if she was afraid of apologizing for her mistake in the beginning, but putting that mumbling, rude, incoherent guy on in place of her was a bigger mistake than if she had just come on herself to rectify the situation. In that conversation he tarnished the reputation of the restaurant in my eyes, and even if i did have a hankering for thai food next time around & im able to go to the restaurant directly, I'd definitely choose a different option."}
{"text":"A friend and I met here for dinner and boy am I glad we did! Sorry Malee's but this is hands down the best Thai food in Phoenix. The owner and his wife greeted us when we arrived, seated us quickly and provided great personal service.

We started with a steaming pot of Tom yum soup, which was a perfect blend of lime, lemongrass and Thai chili spice with a healthy portion of shrimp.  The hot pot was large enough to serve four for an appetizer.

I ordered the Sabai sweet curry with chicken which was absolutely delicious. The chicken was a little dry but no matter, just dunking it in the delicious and plentiful amount of curry sauce made it perfect.  I took the leftover sauce to go thinking I could make some rice and chicken at home and use the sauce again. My friend ordered the lemongrass pork and eggplant. The bite she would actually share with me was amazing. 

The food was a little slow coming out of the kitchen but was well worth the wait. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Eric, 

I dont care about the delivery charge. Your food is overpriced, and the lady who took the order was horrible to me. So I will never come back and dine in your restaurant. No, thank you."}
{"text":"Quite disappointing.  We started our lunch with a bowl of Tom Yum soup.  The usual hot and sour became hot and sweet.  It tasted like it was cooked with tomato paste.  The pad thai was way too sweet.  Spicy fried rice was bland with big pieces of carrots, broccoli,  and jalapeños.  

Also, way overpriced."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday to have a kind of early dinner with my cousin's gf. This is the first restaurant that I've been to since moving here and it did not disappoint. The decor was really nice, modern and simple. We were greeted by who I think was the manager and a waiter.  we were seated and served water really fast. I thought it was so cute how the water had a slice of  cucumber in it. Anyway we took a look at the menu and we both already knew we wanted the pad thai.  I've had pad thai from plenty of places in California and thought I've had the best, but wow the pad thai at this place was just perfect to me. It had the right amount of spice, sweetness and the noodles were perfect. Not to mention they didn't skimp out on the meat at all. chunks of chicken and 3 big pieces of shrimp. oh man it was good! As for appetizers, I didn't really want anything, but since it was happy hour I believe it was $2 off (don't quote me on that lol) I was sad to see they didn't have fresh shrimp spring rolls on the menu. (shrimp, noodles, cilantro, mint wrapped in rice paper served with peanut sauce) The waiter recommended the vegetable spring roll though. It reminded me of the fried eggrolls you get at chinese food places. pretty good, although nothing spectacular. All in all I loved the pad thai, service and decor. wish they had fresh spring rolls though. would def recommend the place and will go there again and try other stuff from the menu."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place.

Thai rolls - way to bread-ey.  Not enough vegetables.
Basil classic - tasted like burnt oil.
Pad see iew - this had hardly any sauce/flavor. Very little chicken in the dish."}
{"text":"I have dined here about 10 times.  Always good.  Nice staff.  Nice bar area.  Friendly.  Dishes are overall very good.  I have worked my way through most of the menu.  Fried rice is exceptional.  Owners are present, visible and very friendly.  Nice, clean, good Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"The pluses: Service was friendly & prompt, Food quality was good/fresh, Atmosphere is a good remodel of a former Wendy's
The minuses: Music (Sirius' Coffeeshop Radio with commercials) was too loud/depressing/crappy (bad unplugged female crooning vocalists), Food flavor was not as tantalizing as expected
The result: I will be back to try another dish because it's in my neighborhood.  Will probably go with take-out so as to avoid the music."}
{"text":"Was here for dinner late Saturday night.   The service was prompt.  They were courteous.  I had the Beef Salad.  Was really good.  My goofing buddy the Fried Vegetable Rice.  He liked it too.  I think if I am back in Phoenix, which I plan to be, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised for delivery! The lettuce wraps, coco soup and spicy flat noodles...all were excellent! Great flavor, freshness and heat! Medium spicy flat noodles were really quite hot. So happy to find great Thai food that delivers! Will definitely order again or dine in soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing curry. My friend and i came during lunch and the service was exceptional. You have to have thw chicken curry and the thai sliders. The edemame is fresh and flavorful. Definitely a must try of you like affordable thai food."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the gruff is about the prices! The portions are large enough for me! And the prices are dead on! It use to be an old Wendy's but is very modern and cool, the transformation is amazing! A great place to take a date! I've had several dishes and they have all been  excellent!  If you order spicy,  Be warned... It can be spicy!!!! The crab wontons are AMAZING! By far the best I've ever had! And the thai iced tea is so addicting!!!  I've been back and will keep coming back! Thanks SaBai!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I went here today for lunch and was pleasantly surprised! Great service and great food!  I ordered the pad thai with a salad.  The pad thai was awesome and the salad dressing was one of the best dressings I've EVER had!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great new spot! Took my wife there for a date night and we were both very impressed. The portions were large and delicious. We started with the coco soup and it was wonderful!  We can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Every dish I have tried has been fantastic.
The service can be hit and miss for lunch, but dinner is better.
They have a full bar too.
My favorite lunch is the jalapeno curry and the Thai Lemonade. Their tofu is really flavorful too! Crispy and yummy"}
{"text":"Food is always great.  Love that you can order take out and it has a drive thru!  Always nice not having to get out of the car in this AZ heat"}
{"text":"great food-thai food as good as any I have tasted, I travel and have eaten Thai all around the southwest. excellent customer service. staff was very friendly-it showed in the way customers were greeted and responses from customers as they left. I just went in for food to go. got my food back to the hotel, tasted it, couldn't stop eating, well, except I had to take a breather and had to type this. if you want an appetizer get the the chicken lettuce wraps, shrimp and garlic-great, spicy noodles w/chicken-unreal. get some extra peanut sauce-am beside myself with the mixing of these dishes."}
{"text":"Living in San Francisco, I'm spoiled by plenty of good Thai restaurants from which to choose. SaBai lived up to the standard, with very flavorful pad prik king and their unusually delicious avocado curry. 

Don't be fooled by the fact that they have a drive-up window for phone order pickups (maybe that just shows how popular they are, and it's a plus that people are not constantly coming and going through the door for takeaway). The atmosphere is nice inside, the staff extremely friendly and efficient, plus it's smart that they offer diners a full bar. I can't wait to go back on my next visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little find with a husband and wife owner and the friendliest staff around.  I had a nice Petite Petit wine and my g/f had the bartender make her a custom hot toddy.  We started with a pot of the Tom Yum Soup and then had the flavorful Seafood Green Curry and the Beef & Broccoli.  Everything was good but the beef and broccoli was exceptional.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"New Thai restaurant discovery. Satay, Curry and Pad Thai were Fab!  Thai Tea was perfect.  Funny that it used to be a Wendy's."}
{"text":"My wife brought me home the Thai Lettuce Wraps. I've been on a strict diet lately due to having brain surgery recently and these were not only excellent in taste but a perfect balance of carbs protein and fat!! Also very filling to be just an appetizer but perfect!! My wife had the Kang Dang Curry and though a little spicy for me still delicious also!!"}
{"text":"Omg! The avocado curry was amazing! Worth the Uber to try it! Yummy! The fried bananas were tasty and light! Casual place with pleasant and responsive staff. Not very busy but food was great quality."}
{"text":"Tried SaBai for lunch one day and Eric, the owner, was a gracious, wonderful host.  The food was exceptional, service was great and the atmosphere is interesting.  I will definitely return for dinner!"}
{"text":"Have been enjoying Sa Bai delivered to my apartment for the last year! Always delicious and always super speedy in 20 mins or less!  Am vegetarian and they are always able to accommodate my orders. We love Drake, always friendly and efficient on the phone and when delivering at our door! Sa Bai is our go to delivery service! Def give it a try! :)"}
{"text":"Very nice.
Searched this place on business and was pleasantly pleased.
Started with the satay chicken, 4 skewers with plenty of sauce, tasty $8.
Followed with the Choo Chee Seafood entree $14, washed down with ice tea $2.
Staff were freindly, place was clean.
I would go again and recommend it.
Total bill inc tax $25.99"}
{"text":"who is rating these reviews? this is not thai food. we ordered three dishes and they all came stir fried withe the same veggies and same sauce. the lemongrass was so hard that it cut the roof of my mouth.  the only thing that was different from each dish was the meat and it ended up costing us $48.  not only was i disappointed, i was furious after opening my take out order and tasting it and it all ended up in the trash."}
{"text":"The wife loves this place. Service was excellent. Drinks were great. Very classy joint."}
{"text":"Quite delicious! Quick service, great drink, just right medium spice level, regular water fill ups! We had the crispy Thai rolls, chicken mint salad, classic Chicken Curry...yum."}
{"text":"This place wasn't awful but it wasn't great. I paid $18 for the avocado green curry with tofu expecting some really incredible dish. I was very disappointed when it arrived. Very minimal veggies, and an okay tasting but no where near the best green curry sauce. I've paid half the price of this dish for more substantial, more delicious, and better presentation. I ended up switching dishes with my boyfriend for his sweet & sour tofu. He liked the curry, but he wasn't the one paying. 

The music and atmosphere was not too great either. Sad indie music played the entire time. 

I did love the water with cucumber. I would go back for the water and maybe try the desserts next time. However will not be ordering curry here again."}
{"text":"I have to give 5 stars... not because it is the best food that I ever tasted...

But it is the best \"Asian\" take-out that I have ever tasted.  Other places are usually greasy, and mildly unappetizing, even.

SaBai is definitely the best Asian take-out I have ever had delivered!!
And fast, accurate delivery with no problems :)

I had the Mahi Mahi (sauce made it less dry); Pad Thai (I'm a fan) and appetizer fried shrimp (yummy).  Finished my plate and it tasted great!"}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place enough.

The decor gives the restaurant a very upscale feel despite the dumpy Arcadia location, the service is phenomenal and you're promptly given a water with cucumber after arriving, and the food is incredible.

For something different, try the Thai Lemonade. It's delicious. Pad Thai and red curry are on point, spice levels are spot on, and there are plenty of options.  Pricing is a little higher than some others, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Thai restaurants around Phoenix and SMT is one of the best in town. I like the papaya salad and chicken satay to start. I have try the pad thai and it is very well prepare (but I usually add some more lime juice, sugar and thai dry hot pepper just for my taste). With Thai food, you suppose to add these things (ask for them) and additional spice yourself. It is a tradition. Anyway for curry, I like the mussaman. They only have the beef mussaman. I wish they have chicken mussaman too - like in Thailand. Another dish you should try is shrimp basil classic. It is sooo good. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Really slammed. Waited but mgr comped meal. Really nice . Better luck next time!"}
{"text":"Service - 4/5 
We were the only ones dining on a Saturday night at 6:30 p.m. At about 7 p.m. there were approximately 6 other parties. One server. He was very nice and apologetic about his service. We ordered dessert ant it did not come out until about 12 minutes. We canceled the order and they comped it out. 

Food - 4/5
Papaya salad was fresh, but the fish sauce was a little too strong
Fried rice was good with pineapple bits 
Pad see ew was good, not too oily 
They ran out of thai iced coffee 0/5
Thai iced tea was great

Cleanliness 5/5

I will be coming back for the great service and food."}
{"text":"For the food quality the price is high. I ordered pad thai which comes with chicken and shrimp. Not only was it way overcooked and chewy there was only 2 pieces of shrimp in the whole meal. For fourteen dollars, i expected much, much better. Not to mention that the overall flavor just wasn't to great and the noodles were soggy not at all like the regular rice pad thai noodles you usually get. We also had a problem with the service. We ordered our food togo, when we first picked up everyone was very nice and kind. Once we got home we realized that our large order of coco soup was extremely spicy when we ordered medium spicy and our small order of coco soup was not spicy at all when we ordered it to be thai spicy. We ordered the large not super spicy so that we could feed it to our kids who like food a little spicy and a special small order of super hot for my mom.  To make that simple they messed our soups up. lol when we called them to let them know about the soup mix up, they were rude and insisted that we were WRONG!!  I was completely shocked. It was a complete waste of fourty five dollars. I will never return to this thai place again which is a shame because it's so close to us."}
{"text":"I love Thai and this is pretty close to my house and had an interesting exterior, so as I was perusing deliveries in the area I went out on a limb. After not being able to order online as it told me my house was out of their location, I called in. They said I was in their area, I ordered, and they quoted me 35 minutes. An hour later I called to check on my order and the same woman answered saying it was just leaving and they had a lot of orders..no apologies, no quote of time. I sat and waited 30 more minutes until it finally came to my door. $40 later, I had large servings of cold and soggy spring rolls and two entrees. Definitely disappointed in the lack of customer service and apologies. I have gotten much better Thai delivery for cheaper and will most likely take my business there instead. I understand having lots of orders which is why restaurants usually quote you double the time...I gave my phone number and it is very easy to call and let me know they are running late or are overbooked etc."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery through Grub hub.  Delivery was fast and the food was excellent.  I got the SaBai fried rice.  Seasoned with curry, had pineapple and dried cranberries.  Really really tasty and different.  My daughter got the curry.  Very good but wish we would have ordered it a little spicier.  You never know how much heat you are going to get with a Thai place so we always start with mild.  Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Driven by this restaurant and figured I had to give it a try...and was absolutely disappointed. The owners have done a great job of decorating the interior, and the touches are modern (cucumber slices in the water, service bar, etc)...but for good authentic Thai food, this is not the place. The service staff was two Asian ladies that were very friendly...but with the open kitchen in the back, I could clearly see that the cooks were two Mexican guys. Mexican guys making \"authentic\" Thai food? Hoping for the best, I ordered the Basil Chicken with vegetables (along with Pad Thai, this is probably the most basic, common Thai dish). However, this was disappointing, as the food lacked Thai flavor, the chicken was overcooked, and instead of having good Asian flavor...was simply spicy. Very disappointed. The Pad See-iew was ok, but acceptable at best. 
Prices are generally $12-18 for dinner menu, so not the cheapest of Thai restaurants. Lunch specials were $8 or so.
Looking at the menu, definitely an interesting menu of salads and soups that sounds good...so if you're someone that thinks Pei Wei is authentic Asian food, this is your spot. Good service, cute decor, great spot for a work lunch. But if you're about the authenticity and quality of the food, try the nearby Thai Lahna or La's Thai."}
{"text":"Wanted something spicy and ordered Spicy noodle! Yep that's spicy! Love it! Also ordered broccoli beef with fried rice and Thai tea for the boyfriend and it was delicious! Fast delivery with grub hub! Will come again!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! very helpful and courteous staff. Very friendly. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We are happy to have tried this place and will be back. I was impressed by the balance of flavors; it seemed possible to taste everything without any one flavor dominating.  All our dishes were this way--we had the clam hot pot, papaya salad, salmon green curry and stir fried noodles with tofu.  All seemed so fresh and light.  We also had the mango mousse cake, mousse with spongecake 'crust' , doused with a thin sieved berry sauce--not too sweet.  

The service was attentive and friendly.  My manfriend can tolerate chili but is not addicted to it as I am-he hesitated to order our food 'thai hot', but afterward thought that 'hot' was not hot enough.  If you can tolerate even a slight burn, get your food  'thai hot'.  

We look foward to trying more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Great new place!   Went there yesterday for dinner.  Quite an impressive job with the decor - turned what was a former fastfood restaurant into a classy and relaxing place to dine.  Someone mentioned the TV, but I don't mind it.  You can sit in the dining area and ignore it, or really not even see it.  But it's nice if you are alone or want to watch a game, and sit at the bar.  The owner's enthusiasm was awesome.  Really nice person.  And the food was great.  I had lemon grass eggplant, and the eggplant was done perfectly - not too oily, mushy, or undercooked.  This is a fete few Thai restauarants master.  The dish was wonderfully infused with basil. My husband had the spicy noodles, which was also excellent (although he ordered it hot, which was a bit much for me).  We got to try the Thai lemonade (really different, mixed with tea and ginger), Thai iced tea (tasty), and the awesome Thai mocha (dessert in a glass).  People should stop complaining about the price - this is really nicely done food with great ingredients (plenty of vegetables, lots of fish dishes, good meats).  And it's well executed.  Nor are the dishes small.  The prices here are not by any means out of line.  More than sloppy low mein, but you get what you pay for.  And here the food is well worth the cost.  I wish SaBai well, and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I just ate here today for lunch. I had the green curry with veggies and tofu lunch special. It was $8 and came with either soup or salad. I choose salad, the peanut dressing was yummy!   My curry was ah-mazing!  It had sliced and cooked jalapenos, eggplant, snap peas, green beans, zucchini, broccoli, and yummy fried tofu. The curry itself was very rich, and the perfect (for me) spice, I ordered it hot, not Thai hot. I have at least one more meal here as leftovers...great find, I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't the best by far. I got a Coco soup which was flavorful, almost too flavorful but nice pieces of white meat chicken. Also got the Garlic Shrimp and I was expecting the typical Garlic Shrimp with a thick sauce. This came drenched in liquid and the shrimp were very chewy. I ate two bites and could not eat anymore. If I ever come back to Phoenix, I will not order delivery from here again. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious cuisine and friendly atmosphere. The pad Thai was right on spot with flavor. I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We are thai food snobs and this place is awesome. They have great choices for veggie and meat heads like us and excellent hospitable service. Presentation of dishes is beautiful and artful."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was quite good and with a brownie sundae with spiced chocolate to finish I left in a good coma!  Service was very good and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken Pad Thai and tastes like syrup. Too much sugar and my brother commented it tastes like ketchup. We told the waitress and instead of offering something on the house she said that we will still be charged so they can only replace the dish. So we are sitting here waiting on the 2nd dish and they didn't put us on top priority...30 mins later and counting. Also the waitress wasn't empathetic and didn't give us honesty she says every dish is good which is false... or something is wrong with the restaurant's staff members' taste buds. Disappointing when a local restaurant can't compete because of wanting that extra $12. In exchange they're losing customers because we will not be returning. So we attempted at asking for a refund and again it was a no. So now we are taking a crappy dish home. Just terrible. So we are scared they did something to the dish so we are throwing it away because who knows what they did.  #terrible #dontcomehere #NotWorthIt"}
{"text":"At first glance I had high hopes. Candles on all tables. Attentive wait staff. Live music(!)...but in the end all this just didn't add up.

The crab wontons were fine. Strong taste of crab and the sauce was very flavorful.
The entrees were far too soupy. Either serve the ingredients with plenty of sauce...or drown the dish in muck and call it a SOUP or a STEW. 

I ordered the Mussaman (braised beef) which was quite flavorful, but the dish was a mess. It was just pieces of onion, scalloped carrots and tender beef lost in a bowl full of broth. I thought I ordered a beef dish...not a soup? And why scallop a carrot? Leave the vegetable alone. Round carrots are fine. 

Choo Chee Seafood was also ordered, with the same result: lost in a soupy mixture with no substance.

It took FOR-EV-ER to get our check. I almost got up to beg the waitress for our tab. It wasn't even busy, so it's not like she was behind.

With all the attention to the decor and overall look of the restaurant, I'm a little saddened that the food has been overlooked. A pretty high price was paid for a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty bad... The best thing we ate was the lettuce wrap appetizers, everything went downhill afterwards. The pad see ew was not as bad as the pad Thai. The pad Thai sauce was unrecognizable (I eat Thai food frequently) and there was way too much of it on the noodles. I would not recommend coming here for Thai food. If you're okay with Americanized Thai food drenched in sauce, go ahead and try it."}
{"text":"I visited this place on a client's recommendation with my fiance.  When we arrived we were greeted and seated promptly.  We ran into two of our friends who were there for lunch as well!  The lunch specials are great.  They were very accommodating to special orders and substitutions.  It makes me happy when I can have brown rice rather than white, and tofu rather than meat.  I enjoyed the pumpkin in the spring rolls and the cucumber slice in the water...might I also mention my love for the bendy straws.  I will be back for lunch again."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, ambiance & service was really great.  Crab Wontons were fabulous and Pad Thai rocked.  Will definitely come back and recommend to my friends!  Great job!"}
{"text":"Upon arriving I liked the ambience of low lighting, candles, and contemporary decor. I was surprised to see live music, although I am not a fan. If I wanted a show, I would go to a show, as I prefer conversation over eating and listening to someone else.

FOOD: the crab wontons were very good, but at a $1/per small wonton, they are a bit pricey. The Choo Chee seafood was a bit disappointing. For $14 I would have expected more, but all I got were literally 2 small scallops and 2 shrimp, a few \"O\" rings of calamari (no tentacles, my favorite) and several clams. Since this was previously a Wendy's restaurant, I keep thinking: \"where's the seafood?!\" The sauce was also very thin and soupy and lacked the multitude of flavors and spices I usually expect in Thai food, not to mention that I didn't see any Kaffir lime leaf garnish. And why were there Jalapenos in this dish? Is this some sort of Mexican influence coming from the kitchen staff?

SERVICE: very friendly and attentive at first but had to wait a very long time (over 20 minutes) just to receive the check.

Conclusion: overpriced for what you can get comparable or better elsewhere (Wild Thaiger, Tom Yum), especially where the chefs are actually Thai."}
{"text":"Great modern fresh Thai food. They have done an awesome job remodeling and decorating the restaurant. I love the Sa Bai fried rice, but everything is good! :) Highly recommended by me."}
{"text":"Ive been here several times, and will say, I prefer to take out or have it delivered.  The inside atmosphere is cute, but every time I am in there its a bit weird.  The experience is a bit awkward, and I can't quite put my finger on it.....

Other than the atmosphere, the food is really good.  They have a lot of menu options and are always willing to substitute different items within the menu.  I usually call ahead for take out, and they have my order ready on time.  I always order my food 'thai hot' and my little to-go box has a little smiley face on it. 

Good food, reasonable price, and a unique local business :)"}
{"text":"America, I think we are to blame for this funky spot only getting three stars. We're weak, America. Weak and fearful of properly spiced food. But we're also fat, so the restaurateurs of the world have settled for feeding us bland crap. 

You can't really just throw some extra pepper sauce or chili powder into a dish after it's cooked and expect good results. Pretty sure that's what happened here when I told them I wanted my food spiced \"authentically\". 

So, sure, it was hot. But it lacked the depth of flavor that develops from really cooking with spice so the end result was a strange combo of hot but bland. 

Admittedly, given the choice between bland Thai and no Thai, I'll still take Thai, and everything was fresh and nicely prepared otherwise. So if you are not like me and don't enjoy setting fires on your tongue, you'll probably love the place."}
{"text":"5 stars for the very friendly and attentive service
5 stars for the oh so delicious Thai Papaya Salad...we killed the 1st order real quick and had to make another order since it was soooo good!"}
{"text":"I wasn't really a big fan of the pad thai here at first; however, couple visits ago, I went here, I guess my taste buds and the pad thai created a little bond. 

First off, the food:

Pad Thai (chicken) -- it is a bit too saucy and sour, in my opinion. It is not bad though. The lunch portion is just right. It also comes with a side soup or salad. I had the salad and it was a basic one. It comes with a peanut sauce.

Summer Roll (all veggie wrap) -- two big veggie rolls 2 types of sauces: a sweet and sour, and a peanut one. I love the peanut sauce. I always get two of those one per roll. :) I also tried the summer roll with chicken; that was really good, too. I ordered this one by itself and I am already stuffed. So if you want to have the summer rolls, make sure you share with someone else or else you won't be able to eat anything else. 

Last time I checked in, I had the thai iced tea (I know it is bad; but it is so GOOD!) along with two glasses of the water that is infused with a cucumber slice (makes it extra refreshing) and the Summer Roll with Chicken. Let me tell ya, I didn't wanna move and wanted to go home. 

One of last times I was here (I guess I am here a lot), I had the house fried rice. It has chicken and shrimp in it, which is a big YUM! It also has cashews in it. I thought it was weird but it gave the soft rice an extra something. Not bad at all. 

Secondly, the service:

Dee and May (hehe, she has the same name as me) are super nice and I've been sitting at the bar more often. Dee told me this is a family owned restaurant and her niece works there. They all speak Thai and it seems like a really cool language. 

Food: 4.7
Service wise, my rate is a 5!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  We ordered the Tom Yum soup, crab won tons and for the main entrees the Garlic shrimp and Mussaman house specialties. Soup was almost warm, garlic shrimp was OK, and crab won tons were cold. The house special meat was so chewy, I could not even finish one bite. After we sent it back, it only took 30 minutes to tell us we it will be 5-10 more minutes."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We walked out after the waitress told us to grab a seat and then she'd be there. We grabbed a seat. Then 3 other parties came in and she sat them, giving them menus and waters. Seemed like she forgot about us. Sorry but I don't have time to wait around for a woman to remember to do her job at lunch time. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai food !! I've been searching for an amazing Thai restaurant, and I have found the one. You won't be disappointed, friendly staff, amazing food and they deliver."}
{"text":"I think this is a gem in a sea of mediocre restaurants. Lunch on Friday was very flavorful fried rice with chicken, tasty shrimp and vegetables. They use fresh herbs; It came with a nice little salad for a total $8.00, generous portions for such a small price. 
My last visit was a Thursday night for pad Thai, also very good but I ordered it mild. Order medium heat (flavor) it's not overwhelming hot. 
 The music is contemporary coffee house blend not the whinny Asian music you get at most Asian restaurants. A very comfortable atmosphere for an intimate conversation, relaxed, clean and friendly. They make a good mojito too."}
{"text":"I had dinner there tonight.  I had the ribs which were absolutely awesome.  It comes dry and the sauce is a ginger base sauce on the side.  The ribs were falling off the bone and very moist.  The fried rice was awesome.  The waitress recommended a petite wine which was perfect.  But I have to comment on the service.  Five stars for service. They are really friendly and seem to enjoy being their and helping all of their guests.  Tonight they had a guy singing and playing a guitar.  Very good and suited the restaurant very well."}
{"text":"As far as Thai food goes, this place is just alright. Nothing here has blown me away and I find the prices to be a little high and the service a little slow for my liking."}
{"text":"Driving up Thomas I almost swerved to the side when I saw a Thai restaurant in this part of town! Signs of the old Wendy's or Mexican restaurant that lasted for a month or 2 were nowhere to be seen, instead you had a very modern and inviting sign that even tells you how to pronounce the name of the restaurant. I was hooked, I could not wait to go and check it out. Upon walking in you are greeted by a very modern decor and it screams intimate dinners can be had here. The wood is dark, the tables are black and the lighting is mostly candlelit. The music was soft and contemporary, the only thing that seemed at odd was the flat-screen TV with sports on it. When the waitress handed me the menu, I was SHOCKED at the prices. I was also shocked that there was NO CURRY (besides massaman beef). The food smelled delicious, so I decided it was probably worth it to stay and give them the chance to woo me. After a few awkward moments of looking at the waitress and her trying to figure out if she should come over and take our order or give us more time she finally came over. We decided on 2 Thai iced coffees, crab won-tons as an appetizer and we would share the pad si ew. 

If you've had Thai iced coffee, you can't wait to get the sweet milky goodness all mixed up to drink. This unfortunately was like drinking Folgers with some cream and sugar added, i was beyond disappointed to say the least. I should have had a clue though when I saw it being dispensed from one of those juice machines that you see in the the Mexican places with \"agua frescas\". 

Anyhow, the won-tons come out, and they are possibly the prettiest things I have ever seen on a plate, they tasted amazing, but the filling was cold. 

The pad si ew was nothing to write home about, for the price we did expect the portion to be larger. 


Overall they did an amazing job in creating an inviting intimate atmosphere, it would definitely be better sans TV. 

Service was ok. 

Prices should definitely reflect location and the demographics of the area, I could just drive to Tempe and get a better meal that is cheaper. 


Hope they adjust accordingly."}
{"text":"I guess modern Thai means dry drunken noodles, ( they don't call them that..I think they call them Spicy noodles) with almost as dry chicken and tasteless egg rolls. I will not be going back. Service was great, but the product fell way short. 
My friend ordered the yellow curry and I tasted it....well maybe not..it HAD NO taste. How can you do that with curry? And she ordered it as a 3 heat level! Pass on this one. Too bad. Very cute ambiance, excellent service and very friendly staff...just terrible Thai food."}
{"text":"We are from northern Indiana, in Scottsdale for a conference. We read some good reviews for Sa Bai online. We decided to try it out, what a great choice! Great attentive sevice and the food and tea is fabulous! The peanut sauce could be a dessert by itself! Well worth the drive."}
{"text":"I've had A LOT of Thai food in my day and this was my least favorite; ever. I found something that was suppose to be \"similar\" to a drunken noodle but I would probably only eat it drunk.

I think the dish was pad suiw so? The fat rice noodles were dry and hard, not fresh. There was so much sauce it made everything way too salty. The reason I love Thai for so much is because the veggies are always so lightly cooked, fresh, and crunchy but these carrots and broccoli were soggy. I was also confused as to why they feel a need to throw a scrambled egg into nearly every dish?!

I only did a take out order and the service didn't seem to bad. Although, the other server was stanging in the middle of the kitchen, eating soup, I didn't see her was her hands after. I know this because there is a mirror that you can view the kitchen, so maybe eat where people can't see?"}
{"text":"Good service, AMAZING chicken wings, pretty good thai food overall.They push the Avo curry but it's not so good. The owner is a bit smarmy, but overall it is a solid Thai place in the area."}
{"text":"I loved the service!  the food was good except for just ONE thing.  I ordered  Cashew chicken, and the chicken, to me, was over cooked and it tasted like it came out of the microwave.

My husband got the Classic Curry with chicken, and it tasted the same way.  

The lettuce wraps were friggin YUMMIELICIOUS!  And they are 1/2 price on happy hour.  I just wish the chicken the main dishes didn't taste like it came out of a microwave:(  it was very disappointing.  

The Decor was good and peaceful.  Quite surprising considering I remember going in there years ago when it was a wendy's.   The service was pretty amazing.  But when I was leaving I noticed the female owner (recognized her from the website) parked in the handicapped spot.  As my mother was handicapped this really bothered me ALOT.  

The thai iced tea was good.  I LOVE the fact that they put cucumber in the water, I am now such a fan that I do this at home as well.  

If you are in the area, its worth a shot.  Do not order any chicken entree's.  Eat the appetizers instead.  I am very disappointed in the owner parking in the handicap spot (yes she drived a black SUV).  

If you are in the area, check it out!  It's worth that for sure!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Food is always good here. Love the thai basil with shrimp, all of the curry dishes, and the lettuce wraps. definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant! Nice modern interior, coupled with great food and service. We had the pad thai entree and the cashew chicken. Nice portions at reasonable prices. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Just a quick review for this unique Thai restaurant in Arcadia. Last week I was craving the exotic lemongrass, curry and exotic spices that come in many different dishes here. I couldn't sl decide which one to order for pickup, but I finally managed to settle on the Sabai Fried Rice. The ordering process was simple and efficient from my laptop and they even had the estimated pickup time in the email confirmation. I drove there a few minutes beforehand, it's only 5 minutes from my massage studio, and it was ready for me at the pickup window.  The succulent aromas began wafting through the Explorer and I couldn't wait to dig in. 

I opened the styrofoam takeout container and was shocked, there were at least 3 orders stuffed inside!  I dove in and enjoyed as much as I could before my next client arrived. After work, I took the leftovers and had a sumptuous dinner at home. I will definitely order takeout or come in for dinner again soon!"}
{"text":"The only good item we ordered was the papaya salad. Their spicy noodles r not spicy and tasteless. Me and my friend we Both ordered spicy noodles in two different levels of hot. His was medium. Mine was mild. But mine ended up become spicier than his which is weird. The shrimp lemongrass soup is too fishy for me."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a friend the other day and I can't believe I didn't check this place out sooner.  I remember when this location used to be a Wendy's while it still has some Wendy's-esque features, they gave it a very nice look:)  I ordered the Thai Lemonade (Thai iced tea with lemonade) and gulped it down in five seconds, it was super delicious.  For food I ordered the CoCo Soup (coconut milk soup) with no meat sub extra veggies and a side of rice.  It was so flavorful, and the soup was just was I was looking for!  My friend was equally pleased with his garlic shrimp dish and side salad.  I can't wait to hit this joint up again when I'm in the mood of tasty Thai cuisine!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Great tasting food. Spicy fried noodles with chicken is fantastic! Try the cucumber ginger martini."}
{"text":"I'll be disappointed if the Pad Thai is made in tradition way. The flavor of sauce is so strong that it covers the others. The shrimp is nice, while the rest is not so delicate. Also the amount of food is beyond necessary for lunch. The service is welcoming though."}
{"text":"The food was great but when they ask how spicy you want it spicy can mean almost uneatable. The service was alright, we had to ask for more water multiple times. The portion side was good. We will be back again to give it another try."}
{"text":"I love this place I have been going here for 4 years now. You can't beat the lunch special if you are around it's only 8 dollars for some of the best Thai food you will have and you can take it to go as well. I love my Jalapeno Curry with white rice and the fried wonton."}
{"text":"This place is decent...have gotten their panang curry and the pad thai and it was ok...i just wish that it all had more flavor and authenticity...i will go back because its quick and if I am in the mood for thai quickly...they have a good deal for lunch...i would suggest it for a quick bite but not for dinner...tbe restaurant inside is pretty and completely different from the outside...it used to be a wendys I think so the outside.still reflects fast food...but its quite ornate inside...the staff was nice...i woukd recommend it.for lunch..."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai joint in the Phoenix area. 
Always fresh, always super friendly, and of course always consistently delicious. I love the ease and convenience of their drive thru window for pickups. Try the Coco Soup (chicken, fresh mushrooms, and a tangy coconut broth) and the spicy noodle! They also have an incredible Pad Thai (I order mine with tofu and chicken--if ordering to go, ask for crispy wontons). I've never tried a dish from here I didn't like but probably need to branch out more--I just can't get past how delicious my go-to's are! 
Spice levels are traditionally Thai (meaning they don't mess around with spice)! 

It's on the more expensive side for local Thai joints BUT you get what you pay for and you can just tell how fresh the ingredients are. 

We love you SaiBai!"}
{"text":"I love Pad Thai but wanted to try something different. I ordered the Pad See-iew, with extra veggies. It was very good, the ladies at work tried some and made me promise I'd tell her when I went again. I ordered pick up for lunch, the bldg used to be a Wendys or something. The interior was casual and fresh."}
{"text":"Great food good service. I was pleasantly surprised with the pad Thai. Venture off the menu here and you will happy."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch today. Very nice atmosphere, I was seated promptly and placed my order. lunch special, I ordered mixed vegetable, and my mate ordered pad thai. You have a choice of soup or salad....... I asked the waitress what the soup was and she told me it was vegetable soup, that sounded good to me. I aksed her what she thought was better the soup or salad and she suggested the soup and she was rite the soup was very good. it was basically broth with some chopped carrots, and celery. my mixed veggies and rice was very good. flavourful and cooked just rite, not over cooked. They offer brown rice which is a big plus in my book. my friends meal pad thai he really enjoyed it.  We will be back, they only complaint or negative I could log here would be the portion size. for 8 or 9 dollars for the lunch special. the portion was small. I never understand why most places serve small portions. especially since I only ordered vegetables. Its not like it would be a great expense to fill your plate with vegetables. my mates pad thai portion was on the plate but it did not cover the plate I mean it was such a small portion that you could see a lot of the porceilin plate. 
So that's my only negative. Food was very tastey. just don't come very hungry. for lunch specials at least not sure how their dinner portions are."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I eat here occasionally and the food is consistently good. The chicken Satay is tender and the Papaya salad tastes fresh.  The servings are large and filling.  We typically order our meals carryout and we can usually pick up the order in 15-20 minutes. The interior looks clean and modern and you can see the kitchen if you look, which is always nice.

If your in the mood for some Thai, you won't find anything better nearby."}
{"text":"This has to be the cleanest restaurant in Phoenix! Delicious food, big portions, and good drink selection! The price for 2 entrees, 1 glass of wine and a soda was $34. The classic chicken curry was the best I've had in Phoenix and my husband had the king beef stir fry plate. Both were served with a bowl of rice. I love how they serve there water with cucumbers so refreshing. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Got to say I am Impressed that although I've been eating the same meal most every visit that the consistency it outstanding.  I have yet to eat a
 Meal that didn't have great flavour that wasn't too comlex and overpowering.  Unless I ask for Thai hot.... The flavours meld together well in all the meals I've eaten here so far.  I know that the city is teaming with Thai food places everywhere you look, but Sa Bai is unassuming yet powerful.  Decent wines and bar with some the for the sports fans and such.   So far no issues with servers or anything... Glass always seems filled without me even seeing them fill it.   I go at different hours and different times and have yet to have questionable service.   I can only use my judgement being a foodie and in the culinary feild for years that's it's worth the visit. Yu make even make it your watering hole.   Try the coco soup it good flavourful filling and inexpensive.   And of course the avacado green curry dish is great... Don't forget the THAI TEA. YUM"}
{"text":"I was in Arcadia today and saw this place so I had to try it out. The menu has some variation from the normal Thai restaurant as well as some classics. I decided to try the jalapeno curry. I was surprised it was not as spicy as I expected but the flavor was excellent. Service in this place could not have been better, everyone was very friendly and attentive. Lunch prices were very good for the quality of the food and was an excellent value in my opinion. I'll definitely be back to try some more new things."}
{"text":"I can't speak for service or the atmosphere because I have only gotten to go here. I always order through grub hub and this place is as good lunch in the office gets! They are fast and my food always arrives hot and not soggy! I hate getting soggy to go food! Pad se ew with tofu and medium spice is amazing. The spice kicks you in the butt. Good for cold days"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place! The food is fresh and always delicious. We have had several different things and are always happy with what we get. My husband's go-to is the Pad See-Yew with beef, and I get the Avocado Curry with tofu. Both are wonderful! We have also tried the Crab Rangoon, Crispy Spring rolls, Pad Thai and Garlic Shrimp, and loved them all. The spiciness is always just what we expect and the flavor of the dishes keep us coming back. We also enjoy their specialty cocktails when waiting for our food. Their staff is friendly and the establishment is clean and decorated nicely. They also have live music on most nights which adds to the overall ambiance of this place. We highly recommend Sa Bai!"}
{"text":"Had dinner on Friday.  It was happy hour which meant that it was $2 off the appetizers.  We had the chicken lettuce wraps. They came with peanut sauce and sweet sauce on the side.  Very tasty and crunchy with cashew and noodles. Main dishes were Beef with Broccoli in Oyster Sauce.  The server asks you how spicy you want it and I said very spicy (to her this meant Thai Spicy)  The second dish was Chicken in Sweet and Sour sauce.  The Beef dish was spectacular in flavor and I ate all the broccoli (which I usually do not eat at all) because it was al dente (broccoli was not soggy or overcooked).  I really, really enjoyed it.  My companion liked the sweet and sour sauce but felt the chicken was overcooked.  I checked it out and agreed.  But the sauce was very good.  Our server Netty? came by often to check on how we were doing and how we liked our food.  She made sure our water glasses were kept full.  The water had cucumber slices in it which made it taste super refreshing.  We had a $10 coupon from the card deck that is sold in participating restaurants so we saved a few bucks.
The bottom line is that we finally found a Thai restaurant that we like and is open 7 days a week.  OOPS, forgot to tell you that there is a nice guy playing the guitar and trying to sing classic melodies.  It was a nice touch. Can't blame a guy for trying."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch here for a take-out order.  That was a big mistake.  If you are getting take-out then call ahead.  I waited almost an hour for my food.  Usually take-out at most places seems to go through a different queue.  Not this day unfortunately.  The restaurant is pretty nice for being a converted Wendy's.  My Pad See Ewe was also pretty good it had a different kind of noodle than I am used too, but that could have been from me being hungry. They also will make anything vegetarian if you ask which is always great. The staff were very nice just a bit frazzled. 

I'll give them another visit.

TIP: Call in Take-out Orders"}
{"text":"Order Tom Yum soup and shrimp wraps. The soup was fantastic, however, I was disappointed that I had ordered the large soup though it appeared to be in the regular size soup container. The shrimp wraps were also great, but would be nice to have an option other than the standard peanut sauce for dipping."}
{"text":"I do like the cucumber slice in my water, nice touch!

This was my third experience at Sa Bai, and I will be returning.  I am a huge fan of the chicken mint salad and it seems healthy to boot.  (Note-must dine in on this item, does not \"take out\" well.

Also had the spring roll appetizer -mediocre (will stick with the lettuce wraps from my prior trip) and pad thai noodles with chicken and shrimp and crispy won tons - yum.

With a little more atmosphere, this place could be elevated to a higher ground."}
{"text":"1st time here and had their special: Avocado Curry with chicken.. medium hot. They should really add this to their regular menu..Everything was fresh, I could really taste the coconut in the curry. I'm very picky but this place is the best I've found in the valley! Me n my friends ordered different dishes to try out as much as we could and we weren't disappointed. *Try their thai ribs, the meat falls off the bone :D"}
{"text":"Got the lunch special. Came with a mini veggie soup or a salad with peanut vinaigrette (this stuff is soooo good). I chose the soup but my mom didn't want her salad so I had both. Very good and the portions were perfect. They didn't just have iceberg lettuce in the salad like most Thai places, they also had some spinach and other greens thrown in. For the entree I got the veggie delight. Lots of bamboo shoots, broccoli, carrots and fried tofu. They also can sub tofu for the other dishes like pad thai or fried rice and can take out the egg to make those dishes vegan. They had yellow curry on their lunch menu but didn't ask if they made it with fish sauce or pure coconut milk/cream. Loved the food and we came here on a chilly, rainy day so a hearty Thai meal really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Damn. I like this place.
It's a great Thai place. Decor is very nice, food is amazing, server is sweetheart !
What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"1 star for the friendly waitress, 1 star to the cleanness of the restaurant.  

I am disappointed the food at this place, can't really taste the Thai flavor from their food.  Hot, sour, spicy, saltiness...are not there.  I believe the food is fresh made cause it is so hot when it serve on the table but the taste got very disappointed.  The soup is vegetables soup with a lot of grounded pepper (which made it spicy).  The green curry beef, only got 6-7 slices of beef and mix veggies, the curry had very light curry taste to it, barely tastes few drop of coconut milk.  Where are the lemongrass, basil, limes, Thai chili, coconut milk...I can't taste any of that from the food and soup here.  The portion of food is like a kid meal, if you are hungry and looking for Thai food, i won't suggest to go there .  By the way, I like the glass of water with couple of cucumber slices in it, it tastes a bit freshness."}
{"text":"This place is so nice and cozy. I have taken my mom and my husband here. Their portions are excellent and the curries are to die for. The staff is super nice plus they also do take out now. I will keep coming back. WARNING:Thai hot is absolutely extremely hot, duh i guess lol."}
{"text":"We've driven by this restaurant a countless number of times and finally decided to stop by. The ambiance is casual and intimate enough that it would be a good place to go as a couple or small group (keep in mind that the Saturday evening we went, it was around 6:30pm or so and not busy at all).

When we sat down, we were given water with cucumber in it, which we thought was a nice touch & we ordered the Thai iced tea, which was really good (maybe a tad expensive, however, considering the glass was small & it cost $3).

After browsing the menu (and looking at some photos on Yelp) we settled on the SaiBai Fried Rice & the Pad Thai for our meals. The fried rice was really unique; it was seasoned with a curry powder which is definitely different  ... I personally haven't had anything like it at a Thai restaurant. There was an abundance of chicken, cashews, & cranberries in it along with a few pieces of shrimp (three to be exact), broccoli (again, three pieces), pineapple and some carrots. The pad thai was decent/good - I'm not a fan of pad thai to begin with so I only had a couple of bites. The noodles & meat were tossed in a sweet & sour type sauce. I guess I don't have much more to say about it but my date finished the whole plate so I guess he liked it!

We had ordered both of the dishes mild but in hindsight, I should've probably gotten the rice at a mild-medium or medium. Overall, because we liked the food & service, we'll probably go back."}
{"text":"I used to love SaBai. The last time few times my hubby and I have ordered food it's been off. The absolute last straw was the final time we went. The service was terrible, our waitress never came by unless we flagged her down. On top of that my food had melted pieces of plastic in it. I stopped eating it immediately when I found the first piece and started picking through the food and found more. They ended up removing my meal from the bill but my husband and I will never go back. I'm still confused as to how a restaurant gets that much plastic in a dish. It was an awful experience."}
{"text":"My return trip to SaBai was excellent.

I stopped in due to an irresistable craving for something with shrimp.  I was in a take out sort of mood, so as I sat at the bar the friendly owner gave me a glass of water with a cucumber slice in it.  I was pretty floored at how refreshing something so simple could be!

I quickly got my order of Garlic Shrimp (extra spicy) and headed home.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked.  So perfect that I can't think of any other shrimp to compare it to.

I was happy to see a decent crowd in the restaurant.  I know I'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"I asked for Spicy Noodle w Chicken; I thought it was a good dish to evaulate the establishment.  I am not impressed.  It tastes like they had \"noodles + chicken\" and they just targeted 85% heat...no unique flavor, nothing interesting, not bad...not good either. Friendly staff..but that only goes so far."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love, going to SaBai for lunches. The services is great when you need to eat a quick lunch on an hour time span from work. The food and service is fantastic! I did order for delivery once and I was bummed about my food that arrived. I typically order Pad Thai and it usually has great flavor with a lot of chicken and shrimp. When I had ordered for delivery it was very dry, low on sauce and the chicken seemed like it had a different texture due to the dryness. Another favorite is the lettuce wraps! The peanut sauce and the flavor is AMAZING! 
I did try to order the Thai hot once as I thought I could handle it and I was completely wrong. They do warn you that it is very hot, and even the waitress says she can't handle it, but they did offer to give me a new plate for free which I thought was great. Since it was my wrong doing I declined the offer, but it shows what great customer service they offer."}
{"text":"The service is quite good. The fact that it's a former Wendy's doesn't bother me.  The food is pleasant, but unfortunately it's not Thai food. Some of the dishes have been sweetened so that it will appeal to non-Thai's, and much of the subtle combination of spices and flavors that make true Thai cooking so special is missing. So if you're looking for real Thai food, keep looking."}
{"text":"I am still searching for the perfect Thai meal so met up with a buddy for lunch at this place.  The place is neutrally decorated and was fairly empty as it was Labor Day.  We both ordered our favorites: pad thai and yellow curry.  This place runs a lunch special with rice, salad, and won tons.The food was OK, nothing exciting but definitely Americanized.  I wish them well and think they have the potential to do a brisk lunch business due to their location and pricing.  As for me, I'm continuing my search."}
{"text":"ordered food for pick up in upon arrival realized that they misunderstood a piece of the order. I asked for a very small change the staff were unbelievably rude and aggressive. There is now no longer any confusion as to why the restaurant was empty on Friday night at 8:30. I asked for a manager or an owner, no one around. Stay away from this place I can't strongly recommend that enough."}
{"text":"I've only had delivery from here but several times.. They're always very prompt, very friendly, and the food is delicious. I recommend the spicy fried rice and/or the spicy fried noodles."}
{"text":"We ordered from the Scottsdale location, and it was not great. I'm giving it 4 stars because I don't want to hurt their business, but I thought they'd want to know what they can do better. I ordered the pad Thai, and it was extremely sweet. My boyfriend did not like his food either - lacking flavor. The spring rolls were excellent, and I really appreciate that you can order your menu item vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free."}
{"text":"The coco soup was excellent, the yellow curry was average, and the choo chee seafood was terrible. Thai iced tea was good. Overall we were disappointed with the food, especially based on the reviews here. We wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"Simply amazing place. If this wasn't far from home I'd order from here all the time. Some friends at work made a run for this place and included me in the lunch group. I ordered the Pad Prik King with beef, spicy level 5. AMAZING. The beef was perfect, just the right amount of sauce, a very well-balanced dish. There was a total of 8 of us who ordered and we all had different picks. Everyone liked what they ordered. This will be a work lunch go-to from now on."}
{"text":"I had the Pad Thai and the lady had the spicy noodle bowl w/ beef.  We both enjoyed our entrees, and the crab wontons were excellent as well.  I'd say it was probably the best Pad Thai I've ever had.  I will definitely be going back in the future."}
{"text":"I had my first meal at this fine establishment today and was thoroughly impressed! The food was fantastic, prices were reasonable and the service was stellar. If you like Thai food or are looking to try it - give this place a shot - you won't be sorry.

A solid 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Ambiance, Excellent Service, and Scrumptious Food

Choo Cheee...Choo Cheee

Every time and Anytime...

This place Rocks!"}
{"text":"I ordered three things - Thai tea, crab wontons, and the classic yellow chicken curry. I had them delivered.
The tea I'm saving for tomorrow morning. The crab wontons were acceptable, if a bit over fried. And the classic curry was unpleasant. The texture of the sauce was gluey. The flavor was just all right, and there wasn't enough food in the curry to support so much sauce."}
{"text":"My party of 3 visited SaBai on a last-minute whim on Sunday night at about 8:15 PM. We ended up being the only ones in the place, as two other parties were leaving as we arrived.  We were greeted and seated quickly, and staff were friendly and efficient throughout our meal (they had nobody else to take care of).  

Atmosphere is pleasant, upscale for the neighborhood, dimly lit, slightly romantic. Cloth napkins and wood floors. Not Asian-themed, but nice. 

Food was quick to arrive and tasty.  Their \"medium\" spice level is pretty mild, as Thai food goes, so if you're looking for spicy, I assume you need to ask for \"hot.\"  It's a little pricey for the area and quality, at $12-16 per item. 

We had the Coco Soup, which was really excellent.  The Curry was good, though again, not as spicy as one would expect.  Pad Thai was OK, but it had some weird kind of crispy won tons on top, which I've never seen on Pad Thai before. I didn't detect any peanuts in it, and other reviewers are correct that there were no bean sprouts or lime.  Chicken and shrimp were present, but not plentiful in this dish. I'm all for adding The Chef's own style to dishes, but with a staple like Pad Thai, I think you need to stick to tradition and what customers are expecting.

There also happened to be a guy playing guitar and singing in there. He had some skill and musical talent, although didn't seem to be able to finish a song. Just noodling around, changing tunes constantly, and it seemed like he was practicing licks or something. This didn't really detract from our meal. It was just weird, especially for a Thai restaurant.

Overall, a decent experience, and there's better, cheaper Thai food nearby, so based mostly on price, I probably won't be rushing in there again except for special occasions."}
{"text":"Not the worst I have ever had but definitely not the best. It is located in a old Wendy's building and they have a drive through pick up window which is nice but with that said as you look in the drive-through window you can see uncovered broccoli laid out next to the employees lunches. Food was not worth the price for what you can get at places like PF Changs or Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Over priced for disgusting food. I ordered pad Thai with chicken and it ended up including shrimp as well. I don't like cooked shrimp. I took 1 bite and tosses it. Pei Wei pad Thai is better and cheaper. That's how bad it was."}
{"text":"I crave this place at least once a week. It is really good!! I made the mistake of ordering the Thai Hot my first time, and even though it was extremely spicy, I couldn't help but eat it anyway - it was THAT good! I really enjoy curry and my fiance enjoys pad thai. We haven't tried anything else from here, yet, but those two are for sure delicious! I have recommended this place to multiple people."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food. Everything is spiced just right, and the selection is perfect. I'm glad they opened another location in Tempe so I can eat here all the time! Great repurpose for the old Wendy's."}
{"text":"The food here is great and the customer service is even better!  I'm a big fan of the staple dish Pad Thai and it did not disappoint.  My husband likes his food with a little kick to it and ordered his dish spicy which it certainly was!  The atmosphere is laid back and friendly, wasn't overly busy (even on a Friday night), and the service was quick.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Took my girl here for Valentines and had a genuinely excellent time here. There was live  music and the place was pretty bumpin but it didn't slow down the service or make me feel overly anxious to order. 

I had the spicy noddles with chicken.. Medium was hot as hell to me but the flavor was bomb! My lady had the honey chicken with rice and we ordered spring rolls and crab wontons for appetizers, everything was hot and cooked perfectly.

The prices are good for what you get and ha drinks were both 6.99 which made my heart smile even more.  I def will be back to get a drink or order a quick lunch and will recommend it to others! 

5 stars"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday with my husband for dinner. We sat down and enjoyed the live music, they had a decent singer playing guitar. We checked our their specials and decided to stray away from our traditional pad thai (I usually regret this). We ordered the chicken curry chow mein dish and the grilled salad. The chow mein was full of vegetables with a rich coconut curry sauce, the flavor was really good and portion size was generous. The salad came with grilled steak, fresh vegetables, and lots of mint, cilantro, and basil. This salad was also very good, lots of fresh flavor and healthy. I did not regret straying away from my traditional order of pad thai. My only complaint is that the chow mein was $18, which I consider a little pricey for Thai food. I would still definitely return."}
{"text":"So happy to discover this wonderful restaurant. We ate lunch today and both enjoyed a terrific Pad Thai and the Jalepeno Curry. The perfect amount of heat. The lunch special came with soup or salad so we tried one of each and they were both attention getters - I would have been content to eat just the soup - it was that good! The service was spot on too - very friendly and they even opened the door for us. We will be back and I encourage you to give it a try."}
{"text":"I called in an order of their Coco soup to eat for a cozy Sunday dinner. It was good, but not the best that i've ever had. It did cure my craving, and was jam packed with chicken which was a major plus. I completely recommend ordering a side of rice to put in the soup, it makes it a meal! It took a while for a call in order (About 25 mins) and the restaurant wasn't very busy but I do have to give props to the lady that took my order, she was VERY friendly! Since my favorite Thai restaurant is closed on Sundays, I would come back here as a replacement since it is in the hood! :)"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the sweet curry! My boyfriend and I always order this takeout because it's much faster. This is definitely our favorite Thai in the area. The portions are large and always filling. I have tried basically every Thai place in Phoenix and this is my new favorite!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I come to town I gotta come here at least once. I have had their specialties and love them. it is a great small, calm atmosphere."}
{"text":"The problem with this place is the customer service. It's so easy to just fix a problem and provide good customer service. When the opposite is provided, the flavor is ruined forever. Others has warned and I didn't listen. Now, I've been burned, too. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place! Coming home from San Francisco, this it's the only delicious thai food that comes close. The green curry special with avocados and chicken is to die for but it was a tad sweeter than I had expected, so if recommend medium spiciness.

Their portions are medium to large for the price and quality.

The bar tender/server we had was older but she was as excited as if she were 21 again and she let us take advantage of happy hour by buying drinks right away but not getting then served to us until later.

Overall, great people, great service, delicious food!"}
{"text":"Above average Thai food for Phoenix takeout.  Good size portions.  Expensive for this kind of food, though.  Difficult to order the correct \"hot\" level - medium is weak and they scare you off of thai hot.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable.  It feels like (and is) a refurbished Wendy's, which I think is funky cool.

Frustrating service.  The first time I called ahead, showed up on time, and wound up waiting an extra 25 minutes for them to finish making my dinner for two.  The next time I called ahead and was assisted by someone who was untrained on the register.  He told me my dinner for four came to $78.  Impossible.  I had to walk him through the entire order a second time as he hunted-and-pecked his way across the register... again."}
{"text":"Honestly, for the price, I expected a lot more.  I made a delivery order via grubhub, and the turn around was good.  It actually came almost 20 minutes ahead of the estimate.

Lettuce Wraps - 3/5 - The lettuce wraps were actually pretty passable.  My only suggestions would be to add a little starch to the stuffing so that it doesn't water down so much in transport, to make sure the lettuce is dried sufficiently, and to bag the lettuce separately from the hot items for transport.

CoCo Soup - 2/5 - I didn't actually care for it, for me the acidity was a bit much, and the taste of lemongrass was overpowering.  That said, I know a lot of people that would like this.

Sa Bai Fried Rice (chicken and pork) - 1/5 - it was just kind of gross.  Very heavy, very one note, and the meat didn't have a pleasant texture at all.

Pad Thai (chicken & shrimp) - 2/5 - The shrimp was overcooked, and the chicken had the same textural issues that the fried rice had.  Overall, it was flavorful and seasoned well, it just wasn't quite right, this was the only dish that imho was well seasoned despite other flaws..

In general, the pricing is a bit high for the quality... if I'd got portions half the size for half the price I'd be happier.  For that matter, if I got half the portion for 3/4 the price and the food itself was good, I'd be very happy.

In general, it seems like they're trying to make up for lower quality with larger portions.  The pricing itself is a bit high compared to similar restaurants in the area.  The chicken/pork seams like it was braized or steamed instead of grilled or otherwise cooked with a higher heat to create a sear and better flavor.  The texture is bad and is reminiscent of what you'd expect from a catering company, not a higher than average priced thai restaurant.

Most of the dishes had a very one-note flavor and weren't well developed.  These problems could be an issue by not having their best staff on a Thursday night, but it's pretty unforgivable.

As it stands, with tax, delivery fee and tip, the order was well over $60, and I have a lot of leftovers that frankly, I'm not going to eat...  I'd ordered a lot of items as the delivery fee and per-item pricing pushed it up a lot, and I wanted to have leftovers for over the weekend.  Given the poor taste, and high priced, I spent a lot for food that's mostly going into the trash bin."}
{"text":"I don't really understand the bad reviews. I really liked this place. I got a pickup window order: pad Thai, crab puffs, summer rolls (not on menu), and chicken lettuce wraps. I liked it all and the service was good."}
{"text":"I'm new to tie food and I'm so glad that I started with this restaurant. My ex is from Hawaii and he was crazy about Thai food, so I decided to give it a try. Glad I did! We have been to this restaurant probably 7-8 times since. I strongly recommend the spicy fried rice. Which you can make not spicy if you're not a fan. (which I'm not.) Overall the first Thai experience was super dope."}
{"text":"First impressions was it was going to be a wonderful experience. The restaurant and bathroom was exceptionally clean. Food was just ok. The owner sat around talking to her friend and her kids while the waitress tried to keep up with the orders.  The owner was completely inattentive to our needs or others waiting to be seated. First and last time for us. I hate to have to box my own food to take it home.  They don't go out of their way to make it a great experience.  Looks great taste is just mediocre. 
Sorry we stopped here for dinner."}
{"text":"Thumbs up! Great delivery choice. Crab wontons are the ticket! Best broccoli beef I have ever had. Happy and stuffed."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Decor rather gloomy. Server was nice but the food was rather slow getting to the table. Price was Mid-range. $8.00 for Papaya salad. Papaya salad had carrots with it and broiled shrimp. As I remembered Papaya salad were only Papaya and dried shrimps. Definetly too much garlics was used on that Papaya salad. This place have potential to be a good restraunt. Need to do something with the decoration and keep the ingrediants ethenic and quit putting carrots in everything!!!"}
{"text":"Started with the YumTom soup on Cristmas eve, totally YUM.  Specials for the evening were Bankok Ribs, very ample delicious ribs, fried rice and well sauced veggies, very good.  Other special was Crispy Fish with steamed veggies veggies very good, fish was moderately good."}
{"text":"I am writing this review because I am having a killer Sai Bai craving at this time and since the restaurant is closed, this is my only coping mechanism. 

I will start off by saying I am a Thai food enthusiast/junkie. I grew up around a lot of AUTHENTIC Thai establishments and will detest any Thai food deemed mediocre. 

Sai Bai is simply AMAZING. So amazing that I am craving it almost every other day.  The taste, the quality meats, the precise cooking technique... Oh my. This place has earned a place in my brain (and stomach). 

The restaurant is clean, beautifully decorated, and the staff is amazing. If you love Thai, try Sai Bai! If you never had Thai, this is a wonderful place for a first timer!"}
{"text":"My husband decided to surprise me and take me here a few months back. I wasn't surprised because I bought  a restaurant.com coupon a few hrs earlier without him noticing. I was puissed because we diddnt have it on us. Anyway we walked in and sat at the bar. Very cute modern rest. friendly bartender and I believe I saw the owner as well. We orderd springrolls. chix pad thai dish, pork dish. All exceptionally good. A must try if you live in the hood.Total price came to $36 for 2 people including tip and 1 beer. It's kinda like a PF changs style but thai. I was enticed by this place and bought 2 more gift certificates which will make my meal 12 bux next visit."}
{"text":"I actually want to leave a one star review, but my bf is insisting his food wasn't \"that bad\". He ordered one of the curry dishes and it was just okay, but my pad Thai was straight up disgusting. It literally shouldn't be called pad Thai, I don't even know what it was. The grizzle part of chicken meat, super oily mushy wide noodles, frozen carrots and broccoli...nasty. Never again."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised with how good my Pad Thai was. Flavor was good, a little sweet a little spicy. Noodles were cooked perfectly and I got a really good amount for the money. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Ok, maybe their chef changed or something because the pad thai was a lot better this time around (although I did ask for medium and my friend could barely eat it.  I'd say it was more of a 7/10 than 5/10).  The crab wontons are kind of expensive, but they have more crab in it than any other place around here.  The papaya salad was decent but not mind blowing.

I think I would prefer cilantro and peanuts in my pad thai but this place is pretty good.  They did overcook the noodles a tiny bit."}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly staff! I'm only giving 4 stars though because the 5 times I have ordered delivery they have only given me everything on my Pad Thai once. The delivery is fast though, they usually say it'll be an hour + but usually arrives in 30-45 mins. Like I said the staff is friendly and the food is awesome, just make sure you are getting everything you pay for."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!
We ordered a business dinner for delivery for 5 people, $88. 
They lost 2 of the dinners.  Lied to us and said it was delivery's fault.  We found out they forgot to pack it. 

WORSE - we said ok, not happy but please bring the two missing dinners.  They had charged us.  

Fast forward 90 minutes later, and 3 follow up calls asking how much longer and they finally said they can't find a driver.   

They are liars!  Crappy customer care. No offer for anything to make up for their incompetence.  No indication they care.  My first negative review on Yelp, but be forewarned.  Shame on you Sa Bai LIES!"}
{"text":"Perfect marriage of Mouth-Watering deliciousness that I crave for! 

Food always taste better when made with love!!! 

Service always great. They are very personable & funny. Also, my to go & delivery orders usually have cute little messages written on the boxes showing their love for me; especially when I broke my leg & couldn't travel to them. 

Owners and cooks always preparing my food perfectly hot & spicy!  My tongue is dancing from the fresh Thai Chili Peppers they use!!

Garlic Shrimp (requested it to be prepared traditional extra Thai hot) is my absolute favorite here. Yum!!  Other faves: Pad Prik King beef, SaBai fried rice, fresh summer rolls (not on menu but if have ingredients will make) & so much more. Also, seasonal pumpkin curry is richly decadent!

Thai coffee is fab; and even the glass of water is refreshing with a slice of cucumber."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! Super fresh! Clean! Nice space! Great music selection! Well stocked little Bar! The best part, aside from the really delicious food, was Pia, our server. Here 1 month from Thailand.. Excellent service!!! She only works Fri, Sat Sun. My daughter fell in love with her and the food!! Great new place to add to our weekly line-up! I used a lot of exclamations because it made us feel happy! And we could all use a little more happy in our lives! Thanks SaBai! See you soon!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a takeout a little over a week ago as we were craving Thai food and a good storm was about to push through...plus this place came highly recommended by a friend!  We were pleasantly surprised by the nice atmosphere, the friendly staff and the tasty food.  We shared four dishes and each was as good as the last: Pad see ew with pork, Pad thai, Beef with broccoli and Cashew chicken."}
{"text":"They are awesome. I had my birthday party here and they didn't freak out when I said there were fifteen of us. Don't be afraid to customize the menu."}
{"text":"One star for ambiance. Food is bad. Very generic and not spicy. Tom yum was terrible and terrible service. My boyfriend and I left livid. Would recommend not going there."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour with a friend recenty had two beers, their version of egg rolls (or spring rolls or whatever you want to call them) chicken wings, and \"soi\" sliders (ground pork with awesome buns) between the two of us. The bill was $25 total, awesome value and everything tasted great."}
{"text":"I hate to begin this way, service sucked! I came here a long while back when they 1st open and the food flavor was so so. 
Today I order sweet& sour chicken, asked for extra crispy- nope soggy! The only thing good was the vegetable soup. Waited & waited for a water refill! Ask for soy sauce & extra napkin! Waited & waited! Never Never again will I go!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place use to be a Wendy's for years since I lived down the street. Still, they made it look nice on the inside (they have a drive thru!) and they even had a man playing his versions of classic rock songs on guitar which was nice. The Hostess was also our server and she was super nice (Go Erin!). 
When a girlfriend of mine and I walked in we saw the specials for the day and when I saw avocado curry I was sold since I'm addicted to avocados. We got the lettce wraps which was good (wish it didn't come with iceburg though) and got it simply because it came with I believe their sweet and sour sauce AND the peanut sauce. LOVE peanut sauce.
From what I saw, they had a full bar. Beer selection was good, nothing on tap though which makes me a sad panda. I had to order the thai tea which was very good and tried the thai coffee, also good.
Avocoda curry was amazing! Though when I got the bill I was sad to see that it cost $18... I understand that when they say it's the special, it means that they don't serve it on their everyday menu.
I'll most def be back, very good place!
P.S. Came on a Monday night."}
{"text":"Food was \"meh\" to be honest. I had spicy noodles (Pad Kee Mao), and they were pretty average and not spicy at all despite me asking for spicy. Coco Soup wasn't that good, I ended up not even eating it because the broth was a little overwhelming.

Also, you can only get Shrimp as an extra and not your main protein, even for additional cost. Not a huge deal, just weird I had to get a combo of meats and technically order extra (additional cost) in order to get shrimp. Hopefully this is a just a glitch in their online ordering system.

I eat and cook a lot of Thai food at home, so maybe I'm being a little critical, but I doubt I'd order from here again. Food wasn't horrible or anything, but for over $30 delivered I expected better."}
{"text":"Walked in to this place on a Monday night and were promptly greeted by our server.  She was very nice and enthusiastic and described all the specials in great detail. We ordered the satay, lettuce wraps, egg rolls and coco soup to start. We were the only guests in the restaurant so our appetizers and drinks arrived promptly.  Things quickly went down hill from there. 

Our food arrived long after we had finished our appetizers and soup.  We had the pad thai and bbq rib special.  Neither were spectacular.  As the dinner crowd began to arrive the staff seemed frantic.  There were only 4 tables besides us and 2 waitresses.  A competent waitstaff should have no problem handling a dining room this size.  The food was ok, nothing special and definitely not authentic thai.  The service was unacceptable.  We sat patiently for 30 minutes waiting for out bill and boxes.  If we hadn't flagged our server down we'd probationary still be there.  Unfortunately, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is set in an old Wendy's establishment. You almost forget it was a Wendy's until you see the iconic windows. This place is nothing to rave about, but they do serve decent food for a decent price. I normally like ordering their pineapple fried rice. Its pretty flavorful. They also have a good amount of cashews in it which I like!"}
{"text":"So far not impressed... pineapple in red curry?!?!
When I asked about it I was told \"it's supposed to have pineapple in it!\" Uh no it is not. I lived in Thailand for 30 years and I never had pineapple in red curry. So no I do not recommend this Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I have only been here a couple of times for lunch and haven't tried much on their menu but my experiences so far have been ok.  Nothing was bad but nothing was really memorable either.

It's a little place that feels like a converted wendy's or other fast food restaurant without much character.  On both occasions, we stuck to the 'lunch specials' but i think i'd be happier ordering from the regular menu.   SaBai serves standard traditional Thai/Fusion fare with typical offerings of stir-fry, curries, and the like."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to check this place out for a long time but I just never got around to it until the other day.  The decor is classy and sophisticated.  Its perfect for a date.  The menu is reasonably priced and the food is spectacular.  

We ate there earlier in the week and had the coconut soup and the SaBai fried rice, both were amazing.  Then, we went again last night.  It was Friday night and they had a guitar player playing.  We had the crab wontons, lettuce wraps, and the SaBai fried rice again.  Everything was amazing."}
{"text":"I must say this place has my vote! I love the fact they use fresh vegetables and their meat testy and fresh!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went in here, once a week for 2 years and dropped $80 at a time or more, we liked the food and the ambiance, then one night we just wanted wanton soup, the soup came tasting like sweet water, so I sent it back, the same dish of soup came back with added black pepper, lol, complained, we just got weak sorry from the server, while the owner sat at the bar and glared at us we didnt drink it, still presented with a $5 bill we, paid it and left and havnt been back in over a year, my friends and I have boycotted this place, even after 2 years the owner never once stopped by our table with a thank you or how is everything,pom
pous a*&"}
{"text":"Love this little Thai restaurant, it's clean good service and great food! Avocado green curry is one of our favorites !"}
{"text":"Great little Thai place just south of the Arcadia area. Very friendly waitstaff. Kept very clean and neat. Excellent pad thai and curries, however any dishes with garlic in them are a bit too overpowering on the garlic."}
{"text":"So SaBai was introduced to us by some friends and oh my! We Love it! It is so good, and service we had by Miriam was outstanding! She treated us really good and our kids as well! Never a bad day at SaBai. We Love this place its our new favorite spot :)"}
{"text":"I like this place. I think it is consistent. It is very clean and the staff is friendly. The only thing is that they should bring their prices down just a little. I recommend their Pad see wee ( I think that's how you spell it). Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Just wonderful!  I came here for a girl's lunch and we had a great time.

We ordered a bunch of different things, but the most exceptional was the classic curry.  Perfectly seasoned, not too hot but plenty flavorful.  Shrimp was good, hot pot was fun.  We ate everything!

If I'm looking for Thai, I'll be happy to return!"}
{"text":"Neat little quiet place with very friendly service.  The cocktail was a bit disappointing, but the food was very nice.  I had a salad with thinly sliced steak and the dressing was a wonderful balance of sweet and hot.  We will be back, for sure, to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"Yuck! Used to eat there a lot but no more..visited the place Friday night and first of all service was awful, took forever for the server to take our order. Then guess what?!? While we were enjoying our pad Thai and such there is a freaking ROACH crawling on the damn table from the sauce plate!!! So of course manager apologize saying well every restaurant has reaches!! Really?!? Enough said...never again. Gross!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean, the ambiance is nice and they have good customer service. The food chicken satay was good, but I didn't like the garlic shrimp or the rice."}
{"text":"Truly the most amazing pad thai in the valley. Truly the most amazing Thai food in the valley served with a whole lot of lovin!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for dinner after work. I had high hopes for this place but I knew when I walked through that door that I shouldn't expect the food to taste like true authentic Thai food. I wanted to give it a try anyways because one of my co-worker loves this place and recommend that I come here. Right away you can tell it used to be a Wendy's fast food joint and the drive through window is still there. The place was nice and clean inside and the low lighting with the candles on the tables make it feel more intimate and romantic if you were on a date. They give you cucumber water which I absolutely enjoyed since that is how I drink my water sometimes at home. I wanted to try their Mango Mojito but they couldn't make it so I ordered the Holly Pop. Let's just say that I didn't like it whatsoever. It was too sweet and tasted weird to me so I barely touched it. 

On to the food! I started with the Coco Soup and the Pad See-iew as an entree both with medium spice level. What can I say? The Coco soup was sour, salty, and creamy from the coconut milk but it was missing something. You can tell it didn't taste authentic. The Pad See-iew was a little bit too sweet and I couldn't taste any spice so I added more chili sauce. I also tried my friends food. One ordered the Avocado Curry, the other ordered Sweet Curry, and the last one ordered the Pad Thai. The Avocado Curry was actually quite tasty and flavorful. The Sweet Curry was bland and lack flavor. The Pad Thai was way too sweet and soggy. It was drowned in sauce or oil as you can see in my pic. Not appetizing at all. We ordered the fried bananas and ice cream to share for dessert. The bananas were wrapped like egg rolls and smothered with chocolate syrup. The outside was soggy and didn't taste like it was freshly made. 

Overall I don't think I will be coming back to this restaurant unless my friends drag me here by my hair. I'm used to home cooked authentic Thai food with robust flavor and spices so if that's what you're looking for then I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Bumping this up to 3 stars because the manager refunded the amount of the meal back to me. However, I had to call back and check, and wasn't invited to try the restaurant again... in fact, he was not very happy about refunding it to me. However, it was done. The food was okay."}
{"text":"...The best Pad Thai I've ever tasted!!!  Crab Wontons melt in your mouth!!! Excellent service... GO !!!"}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Mint salad and it was a wonderful balance of flavors, spice and heat, highlighted by mint.  Refreshing and tasty, hot and bright.  A touch of spice producing some heat, but well balanced and flavorful. The salad was a full meal but it was a hot day in the 90's so I also had the standard Iced Tea which was flavored with peach.  Service was prompt and my tea never went empty...all four times.
$8 for the salad, $2 for the tea.  I'd return and try other dishes, very nice."}
{"text":"Great little thai spot!

Old Wendy's restaurant that has beeen converted into a quaint, nicely decorated, dimly lit little spot.  I have tried 5 dishes from here and they have all been FABULOUS!  Full of flavor and spice.  I've tried the Pad Thai, Cashew Chicken, Shrimp Basil, Thai Green Curry and Choo Chee Seafood (oh and the Crispy Thai Rolls) and they have all been great.  

Hard to come by good Thai in Phoenix, but I hope this place sticks around!  Excellent service as well. My only complaint would be that the music they were playing could have been a little more upbeat for a Friday night  :-)  Will be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Definitely won't be back. Prices are ridiculous for the quality. Not to mention the service ( I'm in the industry). The pumpkin curry entree was $18 and mediocre at best."}
{"text":"While not much to look at on the outside, the food more than makes up for it!  The lunch specials are a great deal -- for $8 you can choose from about ten options, each of which comes with soup of the day or their house salad.  We had the salad, which arrived on a pretty little square plate and had a delicious, limey peanut-sesame dressing.  Usually the side salads at Asian restaurants are kind of throwaways, but we would order this one again.   The Tom Yum soup is also delicious.  We will be back for lunch and probably for dinner too once they get their liquor license."}
{"text":"I recommend the pad thai and curry! The food is delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp pad Thai. It was ok. The noodles were a bit mushy. The shrimp were cooked well.  It really about the noodles with pad Thai.  For $16 they could've done much better.  It was a 2.5 star meal. What got me though is after the charge cleared my account it ended up costing me over $32.  So I call them and I asked them why am I being charged double for this meal? She asked me if I gave a $16 tip. I asked her, \"Why would I give a $16 tip?\" So she looks back at the receipt and she said that someone wrote in a $16 tip for the meal. I had to drive back down there to give my card to have it refunded.  I don't remember an apology.  It was almost like they thought maybe I had \"tippers remorse\", and regretted giving a $16 tip on there amazing take out meal after the fact.  They refunded me the $16, but that really needs to be looked into... Check your bank statement."}
{"text":"Since I ordered delivery, this review is based entirely on the food and it's swiftness. : )

To start off I tried the VERY Spicy Rice with Chicken and Jasmine Rice(all from the comfort of my sofa)---- and for once I am not yearning for more spice factor! Finally a very spicy label that delivers! : )

I then had a \"Hot Pot\" of the Wonton Soup which is also delicious. The broth is wonderfully flavorful, without being too salty and there is a really decent amount of veggies in the soup along with the wontons. I will definitely be ordering SaBai Modern Thai again soon! 

**I had to save 1/2 of each item for tomorrow as they are ample portions. And I eat A LOT.
Yay for leftover Thai meow!"}
{"text":"You enter and you are a little disoriented.  There are no customary photos of the Thai royal family and you pause to ask yourself if anything good come out of a building that once housed a Wendy's. But the service is efficient, the ambiance surprisingly charming, and the food on par with the better Thai spots in the area."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this new Thai place and decided to on my way home last night.  I was greeted by the owner and his wife (the operations and chef) and sat at the bar for a quick to-go.  I wish I could have enjoyed a cold beer while waiting but they were still a couple weeks out on the liquor license...please hurry up!  

      I ordered the Pad Thai as it's an easy choice to gauge a new place.  I ordered it Thai hot and that is what I got!  The dish was super hot (as I wanted) yet still very flavorful with big shrimp and chicken.  I ordered without looking at the menu and was a little surprised by the $13 price tag but the food was really good so I'm not upset.  I will return once they have the liquor license and eat in to get the full feel of the place.  I think it is a little funny that they choose a old Wendy's to renovate but they made it work well enough.  Wendy's are tough to do much with once they close down so I am glad that it was taken up.  I care less of a place's location as the food that comes out of it.

     Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Worst ever! I ordered multiple items with chicken for delivery. They ran out of chicken and substituted tofu without asking. I hate tofu. It's in every dish I ordered now. My entire dinner is ruined. I'll never eat hear again. Why would I want tofu if I ordered meat?"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch.  I had the Jalapeno curry with Tofu, the Hubby had Fried Rice.  Both were awesome.  Everything has a modern twist on it.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"They have a drive thru, the staff is super nice (I ordered to-go and they sat me down to wait, gave me a water and called me 'sweetie' ), and the food is DELICIOUS. I had their spicy fried rice and not only do they give you a ton of food, it all has so much flavor!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out tonight. The ambiance inside was real nice. Dim lighting and tea light candles on the tables set the mood. The host/ our server was nice and friendly. For it a slow night prompter service could've been given. Anyways we tried the crab wontons I've heard such great reviews for, and I'd have to say they met my expectations. Delicious! Although $6 for small six pieces of wontons seemed over priced. Then to our meals. I ordered the Curry Chicken ($12) and my boyfriend had the Cashew Chicken ($12). Our orders didn't take too long to come out. My chicken curry was quite watery and wasn't as flavorful. It seemed like it had the potential to be a great meal but was added an extra unneccesary cup of water. The cashew chicken though was pretty good, but nothing too special. 

I'd say that I'd visit this restaurant again, however maybe only during lunch to get the meals for their lunch prices. It just a bit overpriced for having nothing real special to offer."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Friday night.  The dishes we ordered were: Coco Soup & Cashew Chicken washed down with a Mango Mojito, and ended with fried banana spring rolls with coconut ice cream.  The service was friendly and good; but the food was fair to average.  The cream cheese filler in the fried banana spring rolls was an unfortunate distraction to the taste."}
{"text":"THis was the best THAI I have had in Phoenix and I have been to quite a few places.  The food is so fresh, the Pad Thai delicious, the Kapow chicken prepared perfectly and the panang chicken was awesome.  Thee portions were ginormous and we could hardly finish our meals with a few appetizers.  The staff was very very pleasant and took excellent care of us.  I will absolutely return for more of this great food."}
{"text":"All vegan everything!! Thank you SaBai for existing. This place I always on point. Never fail to have a 5 star experience here. Keep it up."}
{"text":"This place just keeps going downhill. First they got rid of the best thing on their menu, the mango mousse cheesecake. They also seem to have changed the wrappers for their crispy veggie rolls so those aren't as good as they used to be. Besides the food the customer service is awful. I ordered online yesterday and today. Both times my special instructions were ignored. If you're not going to read it then why even give the option? Today they forgot my shrimp so I asked her to just put it on the side. She handed me a container with 2 shrimp. Literally TWO and was so rude to me about it. I'm so done with eating here. My office is close but I'll just find another place to eat."}
{"text":"Our first time and very happy!  The Coco soup in the hot pot was some of the best we have had!  Also house rice and green papaya salad.  All delicious !  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I typically order through GrubHub, but have been to the restaurant twice. Always a good experience - there seemed to be a few months when the spice level / flavor of the pad thai changed slightly, but it's been back to 'SaBai normal' now. My favorite pad thai in Central Phoenix and a go-to for us when neither one wants to cook dinner!"}
{"text":"A cool little place with freaking spectacular food.

The tom ka is excellent.  And ask for the avocado yellow curry (it might not be on the menu).  You will be delighted!"}
{"text":"I'd had the beef in basil sauce. Not exactly what I was thinking when I got the dish. The beef was more like Mongolian beef style. They did have some basil. Flavor overall was okay, but I would have liked more of a mince chopped beef style type of dish. It felt like the dish was more of a fusion of Mongolian beef / almost your usual  pad gra prow,, wish I was craving more for. But they don't have that on the menu. 

Number 3 spicy, is not spicy at all. So if you want spicy maybe put more emphasis on telling them to be Thai spicy.

The waitress or waiter was super attentive and pretty quick with service. Friendly overall. No issues there. Inside was pretty clean even though outside looks different or not as fancy. Parking is not an issue. Pricing is Usual thai price around $14. 

Would recommend checking other thai places."}
{"text":"Amazinggggg! My go to lunch spot! I've gotten sweet and sour chicken, pad Thai, garlic chicken, won ton soup on all separate occasions and extremely satisfied! Always hot, quick, and friendly service! I'll have to check out their new Tempe location! Signed an extremely picky eater lol"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch specials!  Only deducting a star bc the spicy level is not consistent- some days medium is more like hot, some days is mild and some days it's a medium! You never know!  Luckily I can handle hot!"}
{"text":"Sa Bai!  Have a drink!  I don't know if I used it in proper context, but hey I'm telling the story!  Well during my visit to the auto mechanic, had to wait for my car so I decided to take a stroll.  Lone and behold I ran into this delightful place.  They even explain what Sa Bai means right on their sign.  I decided from there I needed to eat lunch plus I love Thai food.  Came in and I was greeted with a smile and I knew -- oh yeah...this is gonna be good.  I sat at the bar, but it was tad bit early for a drink (plus I had too much last night) I always order the fried rice noodles at Thai restaurants -- I believe this makes or breaks a Thai joint -- Stir Fried Rice noodles w/ Chicken.  It came out so quick I thought I was at McThai-Food!  Though I know it was freshly made since it was steaming and the veggies were so colorful.  Result = smile on my face and a happy belly -- Burp!  Sa Bai indeed!  As for the ambience (Sa Bai dude!) -- it was definitely a fast food restaurant before, but they did well with their decors - lots of sunlight with a Bombay look.  Let's just say I walked back to the auto mechanic forgetting about why I was there in the first place. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good spot. I've been here only once and grabbed takeout. The pad thai and pad see ew were good. Nothing special, but good enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"I started with the lettuce wraps, had the Pad Thai and Pad See-iew, and finished with the fried bananas. 

First off the Pad thai was different from what i expected i'm used to flat thick noodles in my pad thai and it was instead 'invisible\" noodles which i like 10x better anyway! The Pad See-iew did have the flat thick noodles but had a taste that was unique so i have to give them a 5 as well. 

The highlight of my meal was the FRIED BANANAS!! THey were bomb! I've never had them before and it was kind of like a cheesecake banana fried thing and was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Had a hankering for Thai food.. this place is right down the street from my house and apparently had been there for a few years but I had never stopped in for a bite.

I went here for dinner on a Monday night.. although we were the only people in the restaurant, the girl working was friendly and helpful, our food came out quicky and was pretty delicious. 


The only thing that seemed odd is that who appeared to either be the owner or manager was there chatting it up with a couple who came in a little after us now making the population in the place a total of 4 customers. He never once stopped to say hi and see how our food was, make an effort to say anything to us. 

Having worked in the restaurant industry in various positions including management, this really rubs me the wrong way. Making relationships with your customers is important and very easy when your business is slow.. that makes people come back and have a memorable experience."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food in east Phoenix!  Every time I eat there I always get the lettuce wraps and mild pad thai!  The staff is friendly and they remember you!  Oh, the peanut sauce!  It's so good!"}
{"text":"Great food and service nas always.

I think it is one of the better Thai places around"}
{"text":"Not the best Thai. The curry had no other flavor profile other than the coconut milk (which if you've had real Thai curry you know it's more than just coconut milk). The pad see ew was missing basil. Tom Yum soup was very bland and missing a lot of flavor. Food made my roommate and I have a stomach ache. Spicy fried rice was not spicy and missing flavor to it as well. Overall, not the best Thai. Definitely would not eat here again unless I was drunk and desperate. A for effort though."}
{"text":"I'm gonna say no.
Tried twice. Service is good. Prompt, friendly, efficient. No qualms there.
Location's good.

BUT, this is NOT Thai food. Chinese, with some red curry & Thai basil. Lots of cornstarch & soy sauce. Mmmm.

Thanks but no. Not ever again."}
{"text":"Fantastic pasta, trendy atmosphere. Love the food every time and the service is always great. The prices are a little higher, but worth the quality of the food. This is now a favorite, and that says a lot for the abundance of food in Hollywood."}
{"text":"ordered food via DoorDash. Soup was missing all veggies as described in the menu. The main dish, hard potatoes, hard beef, and burned rice (the kind you get at the bottom of the rice cooker). Horrible experience, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Meh...  The food was OK, not great and not terrible.  It was a bit heavy on both salt and oil.  Service was very friendly, but pretty slow.  Took 20+ minutes to get one basic dish out.  I wouldn't necessarily avoid this place, but there are better options for good Thai."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout and thought that the staff was very pleasant. The price tag was a little on the high side, but I was in the mood for Thai and have been wanting to try this place for a long time. I ordered the crispy thai rolls, spicy seafood soup hot pot, cashew chicken and the lemongrass & eggplant chicken. 

The thai rolls were a little too sweet (I like to leave that task to the sweet chili paste, but because it was already so sweet, I couldn't even add that to it).

The spicy seafood soup was EXCELLENT! We really enjoyed the flavor of the broth and the wide variety of morsels in it. I would go back for this one.

The cashew chicken was ok, but didn't really have much flavor to it and the sauce tasted quite a bit like the sauce for the lemongrass & eggplant chicken.

I LOVE eggplant. It's one of my favorites, especially in thai food. However, the lemongrass & eggplant chicken wasn't very impressive. The eggplant was undercooked, which pretty much just had me pushing it, what is usually my favorite part, off to the side. 

Wild Thaiger and Thai Hut will remain my go-to places for the time being."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. 
5 stars for the food and service

They have trees in the back and actually grow the things they use. I've found, by talking to staff, that they have a farm and most of their food used is grown here in the valley. And you can tell in the taste of the various dishes. 

I've been to over 15 other Thai restaurants and this is by far the best I've been to."}
{"text":"I got take out tonight and it was amazing. I got the avacado curry and it was to die for. After that I dove into the pad Thai. Everything was perfect. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from amazon prime. Pad Thai and wonton soup. Here's the pics. Overall pretty damn fast and yummy."}
{"text":"Ordered thru grub hub and my order was incorrect after waiting over an hour for delivery! I asked the driver to wait while I checked my food and he did not so of course it was incorrect. The flavors were bland, the food was not spicy. It was cold and the items inside the order were all wrong. I asked for extra sauce and veggies and received 2 broccoli stalks and some dry noodles on the side. I contacted grub hub to see if the would send me out my missing items and to fix my dry pad Thai and they said the restaurant has refused to do anything about it. No refunds. I will never order from here ever again and I advise you to do the same!"}
{"text":"I travel extensively and have eaten Thai food in restaurants all over the planet so I know how good or bad thai food can be. 

Having said that, I don't agree with some of the mediocre reviews on the site, the food here is excellent. The dishes are always delicately prepared and the produce is always crispy fresh and extremely flavorful. 

The staff is excellent and very accommodating towards special requests and the atmosphere is unique in the sense that its progressive with live contemporary music (not your stereotypical Thai \"atmosphere\" tapes playing)

To put it in perspective I eat here at least once or twice a week and there are many other Thai restaurants to choose from. 

If you're teetering, give it a shot I think you'll find it to be excellent."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was able to try their Pad Thai. It comes with Shrimp and Chicken as well as your choice of soup or salad. We got it with Medium Spice and it was not too spicy. The lemonade was good also but no free refills. I would suggest this if your in Arcadia and looking for great priced Thai Food."}
{"text":"Was my first time here..looks like a redone fast food joint but they did a great job with the space..very modern and open. 

We started with the hot pot of coco soup..came out steaming hot and delicious. 

Had the Pad Thai and it was a huge serving packed with chicken and shrimp.. I was pleasantly suprised.  Was a great dish. 

Great modern Thai at very reasonable prices..I'll be sure to put check this place out."}
{"text":"Service is really good. Food is even better. Hidden gem. Pad thai is amazzzzing. Daily specials and great happy hour"}
{"text":"Service is really fast, their lunch specials prices are great. Love their Kang Dang and Jalapeno curry lunch specials. Only downside, I've gotten to go through their drive thru and they always forget a fork and napkin :( If you dine in, their cucumber water is to die for... Been for dinner but the prices are outrageously high, especially for the avocado green curry... I'm talking shockingly high and not worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. The curry is anything but bland, which tends to happen at commercial or chain Thai places. That's not the case here, you can really taste all the different flavors and spices in the curry. It's so good that I could have it with just rice. I have gotten the red, green, and yellow. Out of the three the green has been my favorite, but it's not for the faint at heart. I love the heat so I always order it hot. If you can't handle spicey the yellow is the way to go. The restaurant is very comfortable and cool on the inside, it's a nice place to go for lunch to beat the heat. They always play good music too, which is nice when you just want to chill out. The staff is also very friendly, and the service is super fast, I've never waited long than 10 minutes for anything, and that's even a stretch for time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and even better service. My mom will drive from peoria just to eat here with me. All their dishes are customizable."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the curries here. Food is always fresh, lots of veggies and sauces made with fresh, ginger, garlic and herbs. The food is rather pricey, but the prices on the lunch menu are just right."}
{"text":"Really good Thai delivery food.  It's always fresh tasting and fast delivery.  I've had many things on the menu and the only things I haven't liked are the curry dishes which I love at other Thai restaurants.  Every dish you are able to choose the spice level which is nice because I like it hot!  Thai tea is really good here too and helps with the spice."}
{"text":"Pretty good. We ordered chicken Pad Thai and my daugther ordered a coco soup and a side of rice. Food prices are reasonable and portions are huge. You'll definitely having a to go boxes"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and service, super cute! My entire family loves this place!"}
{"text":"SaBai offers your standard Thai fare in a former-Wendy's-made-hip atmosphere. I got the classic curry lunch special with tofu, crab wontons and Thai tea. Total: $18.

I asked for the curry medium, but it was a bit spicy for me. Yummy, lots of potatoes and carrots (unlike Thai Lahna). The crab wontons were fabulous, and the Thai tea was probably the best I've had.

When I told the waiter I liked the Thai tea, he recommended that next time I order it with lemonade instead of milk. He said it's like a Thai Arnold Palmer; they call it the Tiger Woods."}
{"text":"This was based on a take out order and for two of the three dishes. 

A few of us ordered Pad Thai - Two of us with shrimp (no chicken) and one regular with the chicken. The chicken pad thai tasted like normal pad thai - sweet with the spice not to much sauce.  The other two with shrimp were like drenched in a sweet and sour sauce - had no bean sprouts (when we asked for extra) and had completely different flavor.  It's the same dish just different protein. They should not taste like completely different dishes.  We both had a few bites and it was so sweet and covered in sauce we ended up tossing our lunches.  Bummed and won't be ordering from here again.  $$ Wasted."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and I just passed by when I was looking for something to eat.  I'm really glad I did.  Its clean, the decor is pretty simple.  I ordered the Spicy Flat noodle(?) And it was really good.  Sometimes I go to restaurants and they ask what level of spicy I want and I always say the hottest/Asian spicy and they it's usually pretty mild. Well this time I actually got real spicy.  I'm Korean and I was happy with the level of spiciness. ^_^ It wasn't so spicy that it took away from the flavor, bit it still made me sweat a bit!  I'm not too familiar with Thai food, so I'm not sure what to compare it to . The waitress was really nice and she came often to give me more water! I wish I remembered her name but she was young.  I am going to remember this place next time I'm in town.  She also kept mentioning the avacado curry to people so I'll have to try that next time!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since it has lots of reviews and 4 stars. I figured it must be good!  It is a rarity that I find Yelp to be inaccurate based on the ratings of others.  I was extremely disappointed! 

The lady who seated us and waited on us was blatantly rude.  I have never had such terrible service, anywhere, ever!  She seemed angry at us just for coming into the establishment.  I figured at least the food would be good, based on the reviews of my fellow Yelpers, however, it was NOT!  

The Pad Thai noodles were overcooked, and the dish was bland.  There were no sprouts to help offset the sogginess.  The dish was not served with lime.  It was easily the worst Pad Thai I've ever had, and Pad Thai happens to be my favorite food, so I eat it all the time, and from lots of different Thai restaurants.  I didn't care for their lettuce wraps either, but something like Pad Thai should be a staple at a Thai restaurant, and should certainly not disappoint as theirs did.   

The atmosphere was nice enough.  It looks like the location used to be a Wendy's or something, and they've fixed it up nicely.  It lacks a lot of Asian flare, but that is the least of their worries based on having experienced their food and service.  

What a shame - they even have a drive-thru!  I certainly would have been back, had it not been such a negative experience.  

Recommended Thai Restaurant alternatives: Wild Thaiger, Malee's, and Soi 4 Bangkok Eatery to name a few of my faves.  Wild Thaiger has my favorite Pad Thai and is also in the Phoenix area as opposed to Scottsdale like Malee's and Soi 4."}
{"text":"It started great.  The coco soup and lettuce wrap started were impeccable.  We ordered an entree to share trying to save room for dessert. The Pad Thai arrived and looked beautiful.  I have had this dish before here and really enjoyed it.  

My son put a spoonful on my plate and one on his.  He tasted a shrimp and immediately said something was off. He decided to just avoid the shrimp and continue with the meal.  I took a bite of chicken and that had a sour taste.  We took a couple of bites of noodles.  No problem there.  

The waitress came and I told her that the shrimp and chicken tasted odd.  She mentioned the chef put fish seasoning on them and that could be it.  She also wanted to know if I had tasted their Pad Thai before. Yes, and it was quite tasty a month ago.  

The waitress took the platter and two plates away.  She came back and said because we ate half of the dish, the restaurant would only charge 50% of the $12 price.  Hummmmm, half of the platter was gone because it was on our two plates uneaten!

The waitress also said I should have told her immediately.   The first time you checked, wasn't soon enough?

Sad and disappointing.  

Ultimately I did not have to pay for the dish but the restaurant acted like they were doing me a favor and I was a cheat."}
{"text":"Avocado Curry is super delicious! The Pad Thai is also still good. The last two times we've been, the noodles have been too greasy though so we often choose a healthier, closer Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time eating here, both times were for take out.  The setup is a little strange when you walk in but it's to be expected I supposed when they converted an old Wendy's drive through (pretty sure it was Wendy's). Anyways, this trip I ordered the tom yum soup and papaya salad.  The soup was eh, mediocre at best.  Tom yum should be a clear hot and sour soup, should be spicy but this was very thick with chili, hard to describe but I only ate half of the small or bowl size serving because it wasn't very good.  The green papaya salad is definitely NOT authentic in flavor but I found it strangely addictive. It almost had a parmesan cheesey flavor to the dressing, I really hope there wasn't any cheese in there but it's the best way I can describe it. I would only order this again if I wasn't wanting a normal salad, but it tasted nothing like an authentic green papaya salad should."}
{"text":"This place is great!  As someone mentioned, its a refurbished Wendy's.  It brings an old school feel to it, they have done great work on the interior.  You can use the drive thru window to pick up to-go orders.  Awesome.

Every time I have ordered here the food has been fantastic.  I always find myself going back to the Pad Thai!   The best thai in the area and quite possibly the best thai I have had in Phoenix.  Also a locally owned restaurant, support this place!"}
{"text":"I have always ordered take out and been very happy with the food and service.  Basics like the pad thai and other dishes, such as the seafood green curry, crab wontons, thai rolls, vegatable delight and salmon in green curry have all been winners.  

I have recommended SaBai to a few people and hope it stays around!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's not super authentic Thai, but they do some interesting and creative dishes. The Avocado curry is one of my favorites, haven't seen that anywhere else. Moderately priced and they have live entertainment occasionally."}
{"text":"Thai is one of our top three ethnic cuisines. For the most part, all Thai chefs seems to know their stuff (we've only eaten in a few that were subpar). The restaurant delivers wonderful, fresh, flavorful, delicious cuisine.  It's become one of our favorite eateries in the valley.  Going there now.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"I know Thai food and eat it quite frequently all over the valley.  This place had good reviews, so I gave it a try.  I was not impressed by the coco soup or the massaman curry I got.  (I have had much better elsewhere.)  The thai lettuce wraps I got were very good.  They did have wonderful customer service and the place had a nice ambiance for sure.  The portions were small though and the price was on the high end for Thai food in the valley.,  Not worth it.  And you have to fight and pay extra for an extra bite of rice! Its such cheap stuff and where you are paying $16 for an entree and $13 for a soup, it should come with rice!"}
{"text":"Sa Bai is good Thai fusion.  I like more tradition \"home style\" Thai but I had ordered the Chicken Basil spicy and the Thai spicy noodles made with Chow Fun noodles. 
That was great and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The food was decent. Out of the 4 plates that we all got I only liked one which was the avocado curry chicken. The shrimp had a fishy taste which was a lil strange and we asked for medium spice and they all came out extremely spicy( and I love spicy food). The pad Thai was alright, the pad see ew was mediocre, and the tofu and vegetables were pretty good actually."}
{"text":"Green curry was pretty good. I'll be back to try other items on the menu. Was surprised that they didn't have the standard chili sauce on the tables. The good news is, the curry was spicy enough without adding chili sauce."}
{"text":"I certainly had a 5 star food experience at this new, close to home establishment.

We arrived at around 8:30PM, and started off with the Crispy Thai Rolls and the Crab Wontons.

The Thai rolls were great, but who isn't a sucker for Crab Wontons that actually have a noticeable amount of crab and cream cheese in them? Not to mention, a small dot of Sriracha Chili Sauce on the top of the Wonton to give it a small bit of fire when you bite into it? They were a real hit, and the best that I am aware of around town.

Next was a Hot Pot of the CoCo Soup. It came out with the full effect of the flame shooting out the top of the Hot Pot, spiced between Hot and Thai Hot per our request. I must say that I was impressed with both, the soup itself, along with the tender cuts of white meat chicken, fresh mushrooms, and whatever galangal shoots are. I guess that those were more for texture. It was rich, but I swear that I could have eaten the entire hot pot if I were there by myself.

Next came the Seafood Green Curry. It was very flavorful, not a huge dish, but came with Calamari Rings, Shrimp, and fresh Clams with the Shell for effect. The dish was ordered Thai Hot, and was topped with a plentiful amount of fresh sliced uncooked Jalapeno rings. The Flavor of the Green Curry and the Jalapenos blended together very well. The dish was of course served with a side of white rice to spoon the goods over before eating to make it a bit more filling.

The service was great. We were served by the manager and met the Owners wife. She had just picked up their liquor license earlier that day, so we got to have a couple of glasses of white wine with our meal.

I wasn't overwhelmed by the prices, considering the quality of what we were served. Our tab was just under $54 for two people, and that included the wine.

I hope to continue to be impressed with this place, it was much better than I ever would have expected. I can't tell you how many times I have walked into a Thai place in the area and been royally disappointed in the flavor and quality of the cheap food. It takes a lot to make me this happy with a place. I wish them the best, and my first impression was love at first sight. Let's see how long this infatuation lasts.

Give them a shot, and then a deserving review to keep them on top of their game.

Cheers! :)"}
{"text":"Been coming her eon and off for a while but never really thought of leaving anything here...but I feel that its worth it to try.

I notice that although it looks from the outside it doesn't look very big but once you get inside It does look very nice.. has nice servers that always kept my glass filled and this was a busy lunch yet I felt that I mattered.

The owner (Eric?) was thoughtful enough to make  the rounds and asked me how things were. he even asked if I had thai tea I told him yes and he comp'ed me a thai tea that was really nice and unexpected  as I said it was very busy lunch,  The phones was very active as I was sitting at the bar eating my Pad Thai. 

 I must say its very good and they use authentic Thai spices and Curry.. ( not India) .  I found out that his wife is thai and that explains why the food doesn't taste like Cardboard American thai food..but real thai,. ( yes I was married to a thai and I should know LOL)   

I didn't have any issues to discuss but will be writing more reviews as time goes by to see if there is change.   

I think that maybe the music was a bit loud but its a cycle at most restaurants that the music is up the crown gets loud and that's maybe it.

Food -good
Drinks -good (I had non alcoholic...but it was always refreshed)(
ambiance - its lunch so a little loud
temp..-its HOT outside but great inside
Bathroom- (don't know about the female restroom)  clean and nice and stocked
kitchen busy busy but foods coming out Plated nicely not messy and everything looks so appetizing I want to buy more dinner but im already full

I am not sure but even busy the servers were catering all the tables and I did not recognize anyone having issue that afternoon"}
{"text":"Value for money ! Tasty with lots of flavor. Try the Sai bai fried rice hot if you like a mix of flavors and textures . Delicious"}
{"text":"We order take-out from here occasionally, about once a month. The food is good, but there aren't a lot of healthy or veggie options on the menu and making substitutions is risky when you call in an order or order online (when they confirm no chicken or oyster stock, etc., you still wonder). So we get the exact same thing every time (curry vegetables or curry tofu vegetables). Sometimes it's really spicy when we order mild, and the tofu may be fried when we order steamed. I wouldn't order online unless you like surprises. Also, they charge $2 extra per dish for brown rice, making it $34 for two _veggie_ dishes, before tip.

I'd recommend dining in if you are a picky eater (vegan). They have a full bar and there was nice acoustic guitar when we've dined there and the food is good."}
{"text":"Order take out here on a pretty constant basis. Great pAd Thai and Thai teas. Great prices too."}
{"text":"Went there with a group for a lunch meeting and everyone was overwhelmed by how good there meal was. Great lunch specials, good service and my personal favorite the Pad Thai with Shrimp and Chicken spicy level 4 of 5 was outstanding."}
{"text":"I was looking for a Thai restaurant by my new place and found this spot... I entered to an empty restaurant and was seated right away and handed a menu... I looked over the menu and went with the Spicy Noodles with beef and an order of the Bangkok Wings... I rate the Experience as followed.

Spicy Noodles with Beef - B+  
Bangkok Wings - B+
Staff - A +

I had a really great meal the wings were the best I have had at a Thai restaurant and would order them again for sure... I look forward to my next visit to this spot."}
{"text":"There are few things that make me giddy, and having thai food delivery is one of them.  Thankfully, I have SaBai Modern Thai to keep that love tank full. ;) 

I live in the Arcadia area, and luckily I am in the delivery zone for their Phoenix location.  Some of our favorite dishes to have delivered are the green papaya salad (topped with 2 pieces of shrimp), pad thai (oh so saucy with chicken and shrimp), and the pad prik king (spicy dish with green beans, we order it with beef).  

Thank you SaiBai for keeping my stomach full, my mouth spicy, and my Netflix churning with your tasty food and fast delivery service!!"}
{"text":"This place is solid. The crazy thing is you forget when you walk in that it used to be a Wendy's. I work nearby and often stop in for a lunch special to-go. The staff is always friendly, have you sit at the bar while you wait and offer the cucumber water while they prepare your food. I am a creature of habit and almost always get the classic (yellow) curry with tofu, but occasionally I'll live dangerously (haha) and get the sweet & sour Thai style (sooo good, the sauce is so tasty and I love that it has cucumbers in it) or the spicy noodle. They get your food out quickly and, more importantly, it always tastes awesome. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Spicey fried rice was so good! Fresh quality ingredients. I ordered mild, however there was no spice at all. I say go spicer then you normally would."}
{"text":"Good Thai food.  Menu selection is a little limited though.  Was looking for some rice and curry but did not find any.  Food came out fast.  The crab wonton was good.  I had ordered the rice with sweet n sour chicken along with cucumbers and pineapple (gotta have my pineapples).  I enjoyed it.  The fried banana was already warm when served.  I prefer them Arizona hot along with the ice cream though. The place actually served liquor!  Too bad I couldn't order any.  Just graduated from AA. Jk. Overall I'd eat here again.  Oh yea the waitress was very friendly and super cute!"}
{"text":"I am not a usual review writer but I have rarely been this dissatisfied with customer service especially from the \"owner\" of a restaurant. 

I ordered food food at 6:06pm and was given a delivery window of 7:06 - 7:16 ... that seemed pretty long but I ordered anyway. At 7:30 my food had not arrived so I called the restaurant and spoke to the \"owner\" Eric who proceeded to tell me to \"stay calm\" and the food would still be hot when it arrived ... told me that is was only 15 minutes past the OUTSIDE delivery window and to \"relax\" and wait for it to arrive ... even when I told him that the phone call was making me more irritated, not less irritated he tried to tell me what the drive time from his restaurant to my home was and that an hour and a half wait was not unreasonable ... since I drive by Sai Bai every single day I am well versed with the real travel time I knew that there was no reasoning with this guy. He certainly did not care about my business... when I told him that his attempt at customer service was definitely falling short and that I would be writing a review he made some snide comment and then he proceeded to HANG UP ON ME. I can assure you that was a first for me. I will do my very best to spread the word about this experience. The manager could of made me very happy with a sincere apology ... instead he was full of excuses, platitudes and sarcasm. Rest assured I will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Great Thai food, clean place, reasonable prices.  Don't let the old Wendy's building scare you.  All of our friends love it too."}
{"text":"The pad thai is amazing! I imagine the rest of the menu is as good but I don't know if I can bring myself to order anything different. The medium is probably as hot as I can go - definitely hotter than other places just so you know before you order. The flavor is amazing! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"It was bad food.  Not crowded, no surprise after that experience, really bad service where the servers didn't give a sh$t.  Never ever going back.  I ordered soup and they asked if I wanted dessert.  Little did I know the crappy soup would be the highlight.  Oh my God, the noodle entree was massively awful. 

Don't go.  It's bad."}
{"text":"So, yes, this lower Arcadia Thai restaurant is still working out a few glitches but I am confident that they can pull it off with a bit of finesse.
First off, the food. It's really good. Fresh, modern and delicious.
The last time we went we had lettuce wraps ( the best I've had anywhere) and Thai Beef with Thai Basil/ They split it beautifully for us-enough for 2.
I haven't had a bad dish yet.
The converted Wendy's is a bit off from the outside but don't let that stop you. It's really cute inside-warm and modern.
Problem is they either have the air on too cold, the music too loud and/or the lights turned way too low. All fixable things.
The servers are still figuring things out, considering the 3 times we've been there it has been pretty dead.
If you like modern Thai food and your tired of Thai Lana...please check this place out-you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"On my last visit to Phoenix we hungry ( yet lazy) so we decided to order delivery from SaBai Modern Thai.  We found the website very easy to use.  The menu items are sorted by type of food: appetizers, soups and salads, house specialties, stir fried entrees, etc.  When you select any item, a window appears asking you to designate a spice level for that particular dish on a scale of no spice, medium, Thai hot, mild, or hot.  You can also designate special instructions such as no onions.  I ordered my dish Thai hot, but my fellow diners stuck to the mild level.  I chose the Mussaman which consists of braised boneless beef short ribs in classic mussaman curry with potatoes, carrots, onions, whole peanut and cinnamon essence.

Our food was delivered quickly; everything was still hot, and the food was packaged securely enough that none of it spilled.  Things started out very well.  They ended well, too.  The dishes were generously portioned and quite delicious.  I couldn't finish all of my rice and curry, so I had enough left over for breakfast the next morning.  I didn't try any of my brother's dishes, so I can't comment on those, but mine was delicious.

The convenience of having food delivered right to the apartment was quite a treat.  I'd definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to eat here for a while and finally decided to get delivery. The delivery was under 45 minutes and the food was great.

We got the fresh spring rolls with shrimp and they were fantastic and crunchy and everything they were supposed to be. Boyfriend had the spicy noodles with chicken which were delicious and filling with a ton of chicken and veggies. He got medium heat and that was nearly too much for me since if you crunched down on some pepper it really gave you a zinger, but they were really good. I got the beef and broccoli with oyster sauce and it didn't disappoint. The veggies were fresh and crunchy and the beef was tender and the sauce was perfect. I got medium heat as well and had the same complaint - over all the heat wasn't bad until you got a big bite of pepper. 

We will definitely be ordering from here again and would like to even go to the restaurant some time as well since its down the street."}
{"text":"After a day of shopping for fortune plants, I had a golden opportunity to take my lovely mom to Sabai. 
We were exhausted and we were famished, so I suggested to have lunch here since we were in the area. 
The restaurant itself is rather roomy and clean. Pink flowers adorn every table which I thought was special. 
Buddha sculptures and fortune plants are also on display. 
They were running a lunch special entree for $8  which includes a soup or salad.
I ordered the veggie delight and a Thai lemonade and mom dearest got the Pad Thai and Thai tea. 
The service here was super quick and the dishes were delicious.
The chef definitely made the dishes pretty and our waitress was super nice. 
The only thing that bothered me was the music. It was a tad loud and distracting, so it was hard to enjoy a good meal.
That said, I'm giving them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a girlfriend and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Pad Thai. In my personal opinion, you can always tell the quality of a Thai restaurant by the Pad Thai. 

That said, I was honestly pretty un-enthused by the place. The music was your typical radio music. The servings were pretty small. And the waitresses were not that great. It took close to ten minutes for the waitress to come along and refill my friend's water. 

In recap: pretty good food, but the rest was not something that I was overly impressed with."}
{"text":"I have been a regular for several months now. Last night my room mate dined there and brought my usual home.  To my surprise it was VERY spicy with I NEVER order.  I took it back and to my surprise I received NO apology, and I the replacement order was a significantly smaller portion than the original order. VERY disappointed will NOT be coming back."}
{"text":"So, I had been wanting to try Sa Bai, a fairly new Thai restaurant near me, and I was hoping for the best.... Well, I thought that the food was okay, but over-priced. The service was fair, to slow, and there aren't enough choices on the menu.  In other words, you can't choose a dish (say green curry) and then also choose your meat (hmm, say chicken). (boo!) The only option they have at the bottom is that any dish can be ordered vegan or vegetarian.

We ordered the crab puffs for an appetizer. These arrived with a teeny little side of salad and were over-browned on top, but nicely presented. I was, however,  pleasantly surprised to see that they actually had crab inside (instead of most Asian restaurants that seem to just wave a piece of crab over them and call them crab puffs). 

We also ordered three entrees; yellow curry vegan style, seafood green curry (which I requested have no calamari or clams in it) and the standard Pad Thai noodle dish (my favorite). 

The yellow curry was flavorful, but didn't have enough heat to it and was a bit too sweet. The seafood green curry had some nice flavor and heat, but arrived barely warm and I found two pieces of calamari in it, so apparently they just picked out the clams and calamari before serving it to me and failed to add any extra shrimp or scallops. Seriously? What if I had been allergic to either clams or calamari?  They also used jalapenos which I feel is rather mundane when there are so many other hot peppers they could have used. The Pad Thai was the best thing we had, not too greasy, but only two shrimp in it (stingy).  

I had a restaurant.com $25 certificate, so the server decided to automatically add a 18% tip on to the bill. That really rubbed me the wrong way - did she think I wouldn't be able to calculate her tip on the WHOLE amount, or that I might reduce her tip because of the kitchen screw up? The server did comp our drinks because of the calamari incident, but we only ordered tea and one soda so big whoop. You can hit most other Thai restaurants and get MUCH more variety at a better price. 

Final notes: The server never asked us how mild or spicy we wanted our dishes and there doesn't seem to be any actual Thai people working in the restaurant. You can TOTALLY tell it's an old Wendy's - it lacks any atmosphere or ambiance. It's seems to be trying to be hipster and trendy but it's WAY too bright and too loud and it's at 44th and Thomas, so... I will NOT be returning as there are MUCH better Thai restaurants more reasonable priced near me.  Finally...There are no kids' choices and I HATE cucumber in my water!!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this wonderful \"NEW\" Thai spot. Well after 4 years lol. We sat at the bar and had great friendly service and food is AMAZING. We will be making this a new weekly stop"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It is by far the best Thai restaurant I've been to in Phoenix. I highly recommend the Sa Bai Fried Rice. Also, they can make any dish vegetarian."}
{"text":"WARNING: Do NOT order delivery. Ordered $50 worth of food through EatStreet, only to get a call 30 minutes after that they would not be delivering our food because there was a mistake and it was \"out of their radius\" for delivery. I entered in my exact address and this restaurant showed in the search results for places willing and able to deliver to my location. I checked my banking account only to find out I had still been charged. I called SeBai back and was told it was an issue they needed to work out with EatStreet because (and I quote) \"You live in Old Town Scottsdale and it's too hard to delivery on the weekends.\" If this is a miscommunication between SeBai and EatStreet, how is it the customer's problem???? It's terrible customer service to refuse service AFTER it's been paid for...especially 30 minutes after the fact. My girlfriend orders from SeBai at least once a week but after this experience, we will find a new local Thai restaurant, and this time we will use Yelp."}
{"text":"Visited SaBai for the first time tonight after searching for a Thai restaurant while in Phoenix on a business trip. Couldn't have been happier with the decision! Portions were huge (we could have skipped the delicious Satay starter, but I'm glad we didn't) and we ended up with enough left for lunch tomorrow. The short ribs I chose were amazing, so tender they fell apart at the touch of the fork, and the avocado chicken curry my wife selected was even better. Hope to make it back before we leave town!"}
{"text":"Tried this place the other day. Meh. 
Service was ok but the kitchen got way behind with only about 1/4 of the restaurant full. The waitress had to apologize several times. She also had to apologize because her manager kept asking her to come back to our table and try to get us to buy some more drinks...which we didn't want. 
Prices are high for Thai food around here. $16 for curry? Better be the best curry in town... Except it so isn't. 
Which brings me to the food. Wife had some sort of seafood soup that was wayyyyy too sweet. She dumped about a half gallon of soy sauce into it trying to balance it out; never got there because it was becoming salty. 
I ordered the sweet curry, which was indeed sweet...but way too thin. Like water thin. Had it been reduced by 50% it would have had a lot more flavor and would have actually adhered to the veggies and chicken. 
Spice level, when ordered \"Thai hot\" was reasonably spicy, not outrageous and not wimpy like a lot of places. 
No chance we'd return, there is just nothing about this place that stands out."}
{"text":"The food is not good. I prefer a more traditional Thai restaurant with more authentic Thai food cooked by a Thai chef instead of a Hispanic Thai chef. If you are not used to authentic Thai food then you may be ok eating here. The yellow curry had no flavor and the poritons were really small and overpriced. The only reason I went to SaBai was becasue my usual authentic delicous Thai restaurant is closed on Sundays. This was not worth the $$$$$.
Would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"SaBai Dii!!  

Located in a Wendy's building and it was a nice set up inside!  They had a huge bar table (some type of brown stone)  in place of where the register area would be.  As usual, I have to try their steak salad.  The owners were there and greeting and serving.  I got to try their \"house\" soup which was in some kind of chicken broth with soy sauce, lot's of white pepper and chunks of veggies.  Decent.  I had asked for the steak salad not to be so runny because it can be made really wet and/or too spicy and I just don't like it!  And probably because my mom makes some of the BEST Thai steak salad ever and every Thai restaurant I test to see how theirs match up to hers!  It was good not the best, but I would get it again for sure.  It's more Americanized than some other Thai places however, it was good.  I hope it stays around!"}
{"text":"Wow. I can't believe this place has such good reviews. Either that or I just had the unfortunate luck of my first and only experience tonight with a horrible server  . I have worked in the service industry for ten years and went here with a former employee/ now manager of a restaurant. It is the first time we have ever left a zero dollar tip. Our female server rushed us over to a table, threw down menus, never even greeted us, and then hounded us to order (we got there at 9 on a tues, when they close at 10). So after rushing our order someone else brought our food out and we literally never saw our server again. I had ordered a drink, and wanted more but never had the opportunity to order one. We then watched as our server was spotted playing on her iPad at the bar. We had to yell out to her to please come over and bring us our check. It's a shame because the food was good, but I will never be back."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday evening it was quiet. Had good customer service and the food was great. Depending on appetite; able to take home leftovers for a second small meal. I will be back again. Smaller menu but as a vegan was able to still find options."}
{"text":"Yummmm! I am so glad we decided to come here on our brief visit to Phoenix! My husband and I both LOVE Thai food and since there seemed to be so many places in the area, we went with the one closest to our hotel with the best rating. What a find! The food was excellent, wonderful service and a decent price! I especially loved that they had sake on the menu...an extra treat! I got the pad thai which was delicious and my husband had the Chee Choo seafood which was outstanding. We both wanted to lick our plates at the end of the meal. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the area and hungry for some delicious Thai food full of mouth-watering flavors! If I lived close by I would go weekly for sure."}
{"text":"Always great food especially the classic chicken curry and the Spicy noodles. For apps try the wings they are awesome"}
{"text":"Attentive staff and yummy food. The prices aren't too bad and the portions are always American size. You have to try the coconut curry chicken hot pot. There was some throwback Rihanna and J-Lo mix music that went really well with my spicy noodles."}
{"text":"Good food! I always order out though... because the service is a little slow and don't always have it together. They always say \"we just opened for business recently and are still working things out as we go\" They have been open for about 2years now I think. Kinda funny!"}
{"text":"I don't live in Phoenix, so I don't really know what the general standard is for Thai food here, but this place wasn't very good.  I ordered the spicy beef salad and the tom yum soup, and ordered both medium spicy.  Neither dish was spicy at all, the beef was overcooked and underseasoned, and the tom yum soup was too salty and lacked substance.  It was basically shrimp broth with some sliced mushrooms.  Service was good, but everything was definitely overpriced, especially for the quality of the dishes served.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I've had in Arizona. I had the Basil Chicken level 4 spicyness which was delish but not spicy enough. Next time I'll try level 5 Thai hot. The chicken satay appetizer was a little dry, but the sauce was great. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"SaBai Thai has become my new go-to place. I absolutely love the dishes, the service, the ambiance, and the overall experience!

This Wendy's converted building is quite deceiving. The inside is beautifully modernized and offers a nice, clean, upscale, and accommodating atmosphere. At night, when the lights go down and the candles are lit, SaBai Thai is a perfect spot to take a date. 

They have an EXCELLENT happy hour, but their normal drink prices are incredibly reasonable as well. I can't tear myself away from the $4 bottle of Sake ($1 off beers/spirits and $5 glasses of wine on HH). I generally sit up at the bar to shoot the shit, but happy hour is good throughout the restaurant. 

As far as food is concerned, I am absolutely addicted to the lettuce wraps (tofu easily substituted) and the classic yellow curry, but the SaBai Fried Rice and the eggplant dish are delicious as well. 

The staff is incredibly friendly, especially Chris and the owner Eric who you can see bopping around from table-to-table making sure the guests are taken care of. His wife, Holly, mans the back of the kitchen and together they have created the perfect Modern Thai environment.

In additional to the great atmosphere, delicious high-quality food, great drink prices, outstanding happy hour, warm and attentive service, they also have GREAT hours, especially for an Asian restaurant. Most Thai places close from 3-5 and don't do Sunday lunch service. SaBai Thai's modern take grants us Thai lovers action all day long, 7 days a week!

I think even Mr. Sheen would agree, SaBai Thai is a WINNER!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had been on the road since Saturday afternoon and we finally had settled in to our hotel room and Yelped where we wanted to have our first dinner during our stay.
Yelp reviews rated this little place as high as the one we had eaten at last time and I was craving me some yellow curry.  We called ahead because its Easter. So with fingers crossed (but understanding if it was closed) we'd hoped they were open. 
Oh my! Not only were they open, but the employees were happy. They seated us right away, went over the special, and took the time to answer and inquire of the questions we asked. 
We started out with Satay (4 with sauce and a slaw type salad and the cucumbers were delicious) and crab wontons (6 of those don't seem like that many but they are plenty). 
Now my husband and I are pretty healthy eaters and I have to say that my eyes were way bigger than my stomach. Unless you are going to share appetizers or make the appetizers your meal, I recommend only getting ONE. We chose the two and continued with the Mussaman for him and for me.... The classic curry... Each with some steamed rice. His must have been pretty tasty as he was able to finish ... Mine ... Fantastic ... But I was so full from the appetizers, I could barely get half done. We boxed it up and I had a yummy snack at the hotel.
We hadn't ordered drinks (the water was very refreshing and adding the cucumber slices was amazing) but we did notice they had a nice selection of alcohol.
The place only served about 6 tables but I am pretty sure it was because of the holiday. We noticed they also had a drive through. I don't see any reason why this is not a packed house on most nights. The prices very reasonable our ticket was only 45 bucks. Everything was nice and clean and the waitress was very good at letting us know where our order stood. 
There is no second chance at the parking lot. If you miss it the first time just simply drive around the block. The entrance is right before the building. The road after is the exit road.
Thank you for our Easter Dinner!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on a whim after hearing about them from the car wash next door. The place was incredibly quiet...one person at the bar, no one in the dining room. We were promptly seated, and looked over the menu, settling on satay and littleneck clams to start with, then the mussaman and curry for entrees. The littleneck clams were very tasty, and the broth lively and sweet. The chicken for the satay was moist and tender, perfectly seasoned with a peanut sauce with a surprisingly light texture. I ordered my mussamon hot, but not Thai hot, and the spice gave me a workout. We finished it off with a mango mousse cake that had my wife and I fighting for the last bite. Nettie's service was friendly and warm, and definitely gave us a good reason to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food! Must try the Avocado green curry and the pad see ew! You can choose the level of spiciness for each dish so we enjoyed the mild spiciness of both dishes. The avocado green curry was creamy filled with vegetables and chicken. As for the pad see ew, my husband ordered that for himself but I kept finding myself picking off his plate. Hahaha. I'll probably be getting my own order next time we go back."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! Everything I've had there is delicious. A word of warning, sometimes medium spice is on the spicy side. Otherwise great!"}
{"text":"The food was overpriced for something you get so little of and the food tasted like it was frozen not fresh. Service wasn't great but there was only one guy doing everything. Of course everyone has their own opinion. This is mine"}
{"text":"My good friend introduced me to this spot when I first moved to Arcadia. I love all their food there and order at least once a month from them. If you're ever in the mood for soup, I highly recommend their wonton soup. :) Their Pad Thai is awesome and so are their noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Nice, quiet location (at least while I was there), dim and romantic.  We had an avocado chicken dish over rice - sorry I can't remember the name of it but it was so good.  I also had a thai iced tea which was so refreshing! I had never had one and was instantly a fan!"}
{"text":"Hate to say it, but average thai food. Ive eaten a lot of thai food all over the country, so maybe a little biased here. I like thai food, I feel like its one level up from chinese, but one level up down from korean. I assume asian food has different levels you have to graduate to.

Ordered to go, no silverware. You read that right, no silverware. Got silverware from the hotel. Was a little annoyed that they didnt supply the necessary tools. Lessons learned, will pack silverware when I travel. So Im given an extra star for that inadvertent travel tip."}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood curry and it looked delicious but tasted very bland, we had to add sugar and fish sauce to make it edible. The pleasant waitress reccomended the spicy chicken as a special whch turned out to be the same sauce and style of Pandas Orange chicken and at $18.00 for orange chicken? Perhaps we came in at a bad day or did not order the right dishes? This place may be over rated. Service was spectacular! Food not!"}
{"text":"Really bad. One star is generous for the food, which is the grossest and worst \"Thai\" food I've ever had. Our waitress disappeared and we didn't want to attempt to explain to the busser who barely spoke English that Thai curry shouldn't have the consistency of grandma's gravy. It was thickened, I guess with corn starch, and the curry sauce jiggled like jello. So, so gross. Do yourself a favor and don't go here."}
{"text":"More like Chinese than Thai, sugary and  bland.   None of the bright, clean spicy flavors one expects from Thai Food.

In the Spicy Fried Noodles  I could not detect the advertised Thai basil, or other flavors, and there were huge chunks of jalapeno complete with seeds instead of the promised poblanos.   The noodles were soggy and had very little in the way of vegetables or protein, just a big huge serving of flabby noodles with no flavor.  I don't think they used any fish sauce, which is a foundation for authentic Thai food.

The lettuce wraps are bland, the chili sauce that comes with them is just sugar sauce, and the peanut sauce is watery. 

 And way too pricey.

I can make better Thai food at home.  It's really not that difficult if you have the right ingredients and care, even just a little bit."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.... but the Google reviews are way off.... that pad Thai was delicious.... keep up the great work... best in Phoenix award.... 2016..."}
{"text":"The ladies in my department and I ordered here through Grub Hub.  I can't speak to their experiences with their order but I ended up getting Pad Thai and their crispy Thai rolls.

The Pad Thai was OK.  I found it to be on the slightly sweeter side but it was good enough to satisfy my Thai cravings.  The crispy rolls were pretty unique to me as I've never tasted anything like that before.  The filling was an unusual blend of veggies but I still liked it enough to finish the order.

I would not order from here by myself but if the group decides to get Thai again, I will probably join them.  There are other Thai places I would choose first over this."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place could be a 4 1/2 or 3 1/2 depending on how you see what happened.  I'll put it this way though, its not the foods fault!  It was delicious, but I learned a valuable lesson.  When ordering food, be clear while on the phone.  Make sure they repeat the order for you and you'll be fine.  MINOR ISSUE.

Actually, she got everything right except for adding chicken to my spicy fried rice with vegetables, thats it(even got how spicy I wanted it off a 1-5 scale).  I'd give it a 4 1/2 cause its a lil pricey at $10 -12 a plate, but they're filling portions cooked exceptionally well."}
{"text":"I have been ordering food from Sa Bai since the first week they opened on Thomas Rd, a long time. Over the past year, changes have frustrated me and I've told them, but the feedback doesn't seem to matter. We like the Pad Thai, and at $13 for mostly noodles, it's expensive. So when they decided to drop the 3 shrimp that came with whatever meat you ordered on it, I thought that was pretty cheap. 
The last 3 times I've ordered this, I've picked it up, got home to find no peanuts. Tonight, I called, I ordered, and specifically asked if we had to ask for peanuts or if they stopped pouring them on. She said they do or them on. I explained they haven't the last 3 times and to make sure they made it in my order. She said she'd make sure the order had peanuts. We got home, no peanuts. I called, they put me on hold forever, so I gave up. Now I'm leaving a negative report, rather than a positive one, all because they either didn't listen to me, or didn't care enough to make my order the way I asked."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and tasty 
We ordered on line and pick up time 
was as promised
We will return!"}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple times, but everyone is friendly and the food is fantastic. Seriously, the lettuce wraps are totally addictive!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch with my husband at Sa Bai on a Friday.  Lunch specials are priced from $8-$10, which is $1-$2 per plate more than most other Thai places around town, so I was expecting some really decent food.  Alas I was sadly disappointed. I ordered the green curry beef jalapeno and my spouse ordered the spicy noodles with chicken. My green curry dish was simply not very good.  There was little beef or jalapeno in my curry, which consisted mostly of a gooey green curry base artificially thickened with cornstarch. My husband's noodle dish was much better, but unremarkable considering the price and small portion size. Both the dining room and bathroom were very clean and well kept, so Sa Bai impressed me as a nice place to maybe go on a first date, but I certainly won't be back for the food anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sai Bai never disappoints. 

I wish the size of the thai tea was larger, or they were cheaper.. because I accidently drink the entire thing beforw my food even comes. No self control! But please order this

As for food, I always go here for Lunch and their Lunch menu is reasonably priced and you get a big portion as well, so get ready for leftovers.
I love the classic pad thai, and any of their curries are amazing."}
{"text":"I love Thai, but this I consider unique Thai. Good stuff if you are in the area. Thai Basil!!"}
{"text":"Pricey, but excellent! And I usually get two meals out of an entree. The green curry is awesome and the shrimp with peanut sauce is addicting. Shrimp was not overcooked and they had brown rice to substitute for white. Great modern atmosphere, small intimate feel. Good drink specials. Service was just ok, but I think it was just our server... Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food around! Pad see ew is my go to and is delicious every time! Cashew chicken is really good too! Not only do they deliver but they have a drive up window for pickup!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review based on my last 2 orders.

Food all of a sudden is BLAND. No spicy or flavor at all. I had the Spicy Noodle (which is my favorite) and there was NO spice or flavor...AT ALL. My co-workers and I ordered from this place twice in the last moths, and we got the same experience, bland boring food. Nothing compared to the first times I went here. I don't know if they changed cooks, but, I am definitely not getting food from here again, until I hear there has been improvements. 




After living in Phoenix for 3 years, and seeing this little Thai Place so many times, I finally decided to stop by.

The place is medium sized, good ambiance, modern, and the service is quick and friendly.

I ordered from the lunch menu: Chicken Pad Thai, and the Spicy Noodle. To be honest, the pad thai was lacking flavor and color, it was bland. However, the Spicy Noodle was delicious! Garlicky and spicy, with veggies, egg and chicken with thick rice noodles...it was so good. I haven't tried anything else, but those 2 dishes; if you want a safe and savory plate, go for the Spicy Noodle."}
{"text":"my go to Thai food in PHX!! one of the Best in town as far as taste n servings. I make a point of stopping by at least once a week. their fried rice is exceptional. well worth the price n the wait, which is not terribly long."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!  I usually order out from here once a week, and love it!  Pad thai is incredible, so are the spicy noodles!  And of course, you have to try the crispy thai rolls!  Definitely a favorite!  I keep meaning to dine in some night as this place has super cool live bands, but haven't yet done it..  They also have fun Thai trinkets you can buy!"}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review and say this place is still a top notch Thai place in Phoenix.  

For starters I had the Crab Wonton's which are a must.  They come with an amazing dipping sauce and have a generous amount of crab not Krab in them which is what makes the difference from a lot of these cheap places in town.  

For the entree I had the Seafood Hot Pot which is full of Shrimp, scallops, clams and calamari with tomatoes and sliced fresh mushrooms in a hot and sour lemon grass broth. I ordered it Thai hot which was great to open up my sinuses and keep my tummy warm : ).  

Everything from the food to the service at this place is top notch.  Don't miss out on this one."}
{"text":"On a solo evening with homework waiting for me I decided to try Saa Ba thai takeout.    One bite and I thought \"Why, oh why, have I waited so long to try this place!  Yum!!!!\"  I got pad Thai and they perfectly accommodated my no chicken/no onion/non spicy request.  And their sticky rice with mango was delish.  I no longer feel the need to drive way down to Wild Thaiger on Central (although I still like them also).    But I am so excited to have this neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The service was fast. I went mid day on a saturday and it was pretty empty hence the fast service. The atmosphere may be a lot livelier at night so if I'm ever in the mood for Thai on a week night I may stop by again."}
{"text":"Mid-sized restaurant built in what used to be a Wendy's fast food restaurant.. The setting is mildly romantic with dim lighting and candle lit tables and the service is a bit short-handed, but that's alright because they're pretty small in size.. I came here because I had a $25 certificate that could be used with a minimum dining bill of $35 from restaurants.com.. People magazine sent me an offer to get a free $25 voucher to any restaurant participating in the program so I figured it was worth trying.. Dishes run in the $12 range and our appetizer was $8.. I ordered the chicken/pork fried rice and it had eggs, toasted cashews, pineapple, onion, and other things.. My friend ordered the cashew chicken with white rice and we shared a satay chicken appetizer.. One of the things that I really enjoyed was the pickled cucumber that came with our appetizer.. It was so good that I asked for more! It was only meant to be a small side dish to compliment the appetizer but I loved it.. Both of our entrees were delicious and it was so good I didn't even save room for dessert.. I have never tried cashews before but thanks to Sa Bai Modern Thai I am now a fan! If I'm ever in the area again I would definitely return here.."}
{"text":"I've been back many times since my last review.

The place is never too busy. It's clean. The staff are welcoming and friendly. The kitchen does an amazing job. The dishes are all prepared to order and the spice levels are accurate. The plating is elegant. The pricing if very fair.

It looks like any other typical fast- or fast casual from the outside. Once inside, it's more like a really good place to enjoy well-prepared Thai at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Okay I must admit I now have tried SaBai about 4 times and it actually seems like it has gotten better.  I haven't tried anything beside the crab wontons and Pad Thai.  The food has become consistent which I think is the hardest thing for a restaurant to do. 

 I still stand buy that it is overpriced though.  But given the other choices and not wanting to drive to Tempe it will suffice.  I am willing to move from a 1 star to 3."}
{"text":"Brought the grandparents here in hopes of impressing them with some quality Thai food... too bad the service almost gave them an aneurysm. The awkwardly loud, clubbish music playing before sunset didn't help either. I was embarrassed when they complained to our waitress about it, but the fact that no one turned it down didn't help the situation.

When asked why our food was taking half an hour, the waitress blamed it on the fact that one of our dishes required grilled salmon. The restaurant was almost completely empty, and anyone who's ever grilled anything knows that that excuse is bullshittery. Redemption arrived in the form of green curry and pad thai, but not before my grandpa threatened to walk out (too bad DQ was his only other option).

Overall, the food was above average in its category (particularly the sauces), and I enjoyed the setting, but the lesson's been learned. This is probably not a family spot. I'd go back if I was with some friends in the area, but if the kitchen makes a habit out of taking their sweet time, I'm out."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the ice coffee, coconut ice cream and the dark seafood soup with all the perfectlu cooked mushrooms."}
{"text":"Crazy busy street to walk on to get here.  You can tell this used to be a fast food joint.  On the outside, it is not so inviting.  GO INSIDE.  GO.  Lunch time was groovy.  The seafood soup is a coat of warmth.  I only did the broth.  The even leave the shells in it. LEGIT.  I am a carb loving fool.  Anyone that is happy in life knows that carbs are what makes the world go round.   RICE ME.  Yep.  I took that plate down like they were taking me to the electric chair.  Balls to the walls awesome.  I even ate it with chicken.  It is something I am trying, chicken.  Whatever.  It was super tender.  Veggie Heaven.  The best part, you ready.  I do this at home on my dishes.  FRESH BASIL.....on hot anything, breaks it down.  On the bite you devour, pops all in your head and just makes dining that much more enjoyable.  Service was groovy.  Huge lot for free parking, hard to come by in the PHX.  Valet here and there.  Give me a break.   I hate touristy crap.  So I was happy I found this spot.  Thanks Yelp.  Great Vacayyyy...Hey."}
{"text":"We started with fried crab wonton and ordered eggplant and fried rice as entree . The food was completely amazing but the service was not good compared to the quality of food."}
{"text":"Thanks to all the helpful yelp reviewers, my husband and I decided to try this place out before our flight from the Phoenix airport - and boy are we happy we did! The food was great, atmosphere was intimate without being sleepy, and the service was right on! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been here on ten different occasions and the food is always good. Service is great and everything tastes really fresh. They take the extra step to work with food allergies."}
{"text":"Just moved to this neighboorhood and trying to navigate through the many asian takeout options and find one I'll be loyal to going forward. This isnt going to be the one for me. 

I ordered take out online and the food was ready on time which was great. When i got home, I noticed that my yellow curry was looking kinda bland. the veggies included were undercooked and the rice on the side was actually completely crunchy and uncooked. Gross. I had an order of fried rice as well, so I ended up eating that and mixing in the chicken from the curry dish to make a big mixed dish. That was ok, so I never ended up complaining about the food to SaBai, but I must say that being able to cook rice should probably be something the restaurant has mastered by now - very disappointing. I think I'll try someplace else from now on."}
{"text":"Coming from LA where i see thai joints on every block, i decided to try this one out on my date. The food was really good! crab wontons were amazing!. I ordered the spicy noodle and the waitress asked me \"do  you want american hot or thai hot?\" and i chose american hot just to play it safe. I totally should have went for thai hot, seeing as i asked for some sriracha on the side and dumped it all over my food :)

The place was very cute, modern, and was not loud so i was actually able to hold a great conversation on my date. 

Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Quick service, friendly staff! Tried the spicy noodles with tofu today and it was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I shared the Sa Bai sweet curry and pad Thai, both were very delicious!! The staff was very friendly and attentive, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Okay, I have visited SaBai a couple of more times since my first visit, so I feel comfortable updating my review, and upgrading to 4 stars!  Woot woot! LOL.  On this last visit I had the spicy noodles with chicken and veggies, and it was very tasty!  Not too spicy (and I like spice) and definitely not bland.  The veggie soup was very tasty as well!  I don't go to this place as often as I should, especially with their bomb $8 lunch specials!  I promise to do better."}
{"text":"Really delicious tai food. Haven't had tai food in a while so I thought I check this place out. The food here is really good I got the spicy SaBai fried rice which has pineapple and cranberries to add a sweetness effect to it. The springs rolls I really enjoyed with their peanut sauce, I think the peanut sauce was nice and warm which complimented the spring rolls perfectly. I had glass of the Tai coffee and being the coffee enthusiast I am I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant i've ever been to. I normally would order over the phone for a pick up. They are very friendly and they appreciate their customers dearly. I remember the first time I ordered their Sabai Fried Rice and I wanted to have yellow curry on the side but unfortunately they didn't serve it that way, so I didn't ask again. One day I order, which probably was a month later, I asked for the same order including the yellow curry on the side and they server said sure. She said, \"I remember you asking before and I realized that would be a great idea because most customers want a side of curry.\" It was an extra $4 but it was worth it. 

I love this place and always recommend it to my friends who lives close to the area."}
{"text":"Again I went back to this AMAZING place where the food continues to be unbelievable.  They have excellent service, tasty starters and delicious mango mojitos.    If you want a very reasonably priced place to eat out, this is your spot.  So worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious! I was always apprehensive about trying Thai food but it was delicious! I had the spicy noodles with vegetables medium heat. It was perfect. I wasn't expecting that balance of flavor! Can't wait to take my fiancé!! Service was efficient and polite.  Must have again!!"}
{"text":"We went in on a Wednesday evening.  

It is a very casual place, but don't let that fool you.  

The food was wonderful and if you are worried about the food being too spicy, or not spicy enough- they make everything to order.  

We had terrific Tom Yum Soup, the lettuce wraps, Salmon Curry, Drunken Noodles and a chicken and avocado curry.  I would recommend any of these dishes. 

They have a full bar.

Best yet for all the food and drinks our bill was under $100.  Pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Sabai is new Thai restaurant located near the car wash that I visit in the Valley of the Sun.  I decided I would give it a try.  The inside definitely has a modern look with contemporary furniture and design.  The food is above average.  We ordered Larb Chicken Salad and Pad Thai.  The Larb Chicken Salad had a great tangy flavor, but the Pad Thai was okay.  I think the food was a bit overpriced because I am used to paying half the price for very authentic Thai food.  I guess you could say we paid for the decor and setting.  I might try this place again in the future when the menu expands to more items."}
{"text":"I have to review again... I am officially done with Sabai.  After a year boycott based on bad experiences, I gave them another try (only Thai delivery in area) and had 2 pretty good experiences.  Delivery has never come in less than an hour.  Today they said 45 minutes and took 90 minutes - which is totally unacceptable when they charge $5 for delivery.  Food was subpar - flavor was off and barely any veggies in fried noodles and the Thai rolls were literally 90% wrapper and 10% filling.  Too bad, we desperately need a good thai place in Arcadia"}
{"text":"I have had 2 or 3 previous experiences that I really enjoyed taking out from here (obviously why I kept returning). My last time was very disappointing. Not only was my order not spicy at all (I ordered it hot) but I couldn't even eat it and ended up throwing $20 of food away. Major bummer. Really want to give it one more shot because of my previous great experiences with the same dish, but also nervous about the inconsistency."}
{"text":"This was quick choice I picked to go eat at with my family, but we were impressed. We ordered the spicy seafood soup(med spice) non spicy fried noodles and 3 Thai iced tea. 

The seafood soup was really good it was delicious. The spiciness was not overpowering it was perfect for us. We ate this with a side of rice. 
The fried noodles were to die for.The flavor was there and the noddles were cooked perfectly. We also enjoyed the Thai Iced tea, it was cold which I appreciated because some places give little ice with it. 

I would recommend this place, it is very pretty inside with plants growing on top of a window. Pictures inserted. Also to end this the food in my opinion was great!"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai place. Love the Massaman curry- perfectly peanuty with some cinnamon essence, just as described. Any of the curries are enough for two meals. This is a gem of a place."}
{"text":"This place has the spiciest pad thai I have ever tried! It was full of flavor and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Open on a holiday 
Professional 

Wasn't expecting this type of experience. Hardly ever order take out, so I was just waiting for disappointment. I was taught to expect the opposite from now on. 
If you like the perfect amount of spice, order medium. And if you like eggs like I do, you may have to request extra. 
Whoever took my order, I appreciate you. Not only did you verify my address and make sure you had a gate code, you made sure my order was just like I wanted it. I didn't know the address at my current location and you waited ---patiently. Seriously, some people can just 5star an experience because they are just awesome. 
Even the man tastebuds gave \"this is really good,\" and we all know that doesn't happen often.

Thank you:)"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!!!  My dad and I came here one day just to check it out.  We ordered two dishes, avocado green curry and a cashew tofu dish and shared both.  The food was SO amazing that we literally spent the entire meal discussing how great the food was!!!  Seriously?!  Avocado Green Curry?!  What?!  I've never heard of it before but now I can't imagine life without it!  My partner and I come here often and we love it!  We are both vegan and the staff is very accommodating and nearly everything can be made vegan and it's absolutely wonderful.  We celebrated our anniversary there because we love the food, staff and atmosphere!  Thank you SaBai!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. But at the end of the day, the food is only OK.

They messed my order up the first time. I ordered the lettuce wraps and a chicken curry(around $16), and did not give me any rice for my curry. Thats ok, shit happens... they offered my next meal on the house.

Fast forward 8 months, I decided to give them another try.  Ordered the same thing. The curry is pretty good, but could use some more filler to go with the sauce(add more veggies/chicken) . The lettuce wraps didn't really have much chicken in them, but they were really tasty as well. On the whole, for the value, there are better places in town, but this is a pretty solid spot if you live next door."}
