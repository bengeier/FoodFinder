{"text":"We just moved to the area and found the food was great.  Our favorite was the house special noodles"}
{"text":"I love the mango chicken here. It's the perfect combination of sweet and a bit of spice. I had it the first time that I ate here, and I love it so much that I order it every time! The service here is very good!"}
{"text":"Had take out from here one day. I've tried the other couple places in FH and this is the only place to go for Chinese in fountain hills as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"only two stars tonight, and i'm being generous ... 
service was ok, 
won ton soup, lots of chicken and veggies but none of it fresh, only one won ton and not a very good won ton at that. ...
house rice was ok, not great, served luke warm ...
pot stickers again ok but not great, and served less than luke warm ...
Cashew chicken came out hot, was the best dish of the meal, rated 2 stars ..."}
{"text":"Where's the meat?  Small portions, canned vegetables barely any meat in most dishes.  The last time I ordered the house fried rice I needed a magnifying glass to find any meat. Not sure why so many good reviews. Over priced for what you get mediocre food at best.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Empty place with loud 80s music blaring from kitchen. Didn't fit. And I love me some 80s! 
Lived in The Hills for 4 years, have seen this place change hands numerous times. Nothing special on this trip. Our server was good. Other than that, nothing to draw you in and make you come back. Food is so-so. Everything tasted the same. 
Wish them well, but fairly certain a new owner will be along by 6/14."}
{"text":"Great food. The staff was friendly and quick. Every dish had a distinct taste and we were very pleased."}
{"text":"Wanted so much to like this place. Arrived starving. After 1 hour and 10 minutes, my entree never arrived. 
I sat there watching others eat. 
When I inquired as to why my meal never came, the waiter snapped \" the chef is busy, okay?\"
Paid the bill. Never offered a return comp. 
Just out. Home, starving. These people are awful. 
Companions claim food mediocre at best. 
Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food-more than we could eat!  Good service and pleasant atmosphere. Many things to choose from. I'd recommend adding the egg roll and egg drop soup--both were great"}
{"text":"The best Asian food I have had in Fountain Hills. Really, the only Asian food I have had in FH !
Why five stars?Several reasons. 
First the clean, open appearance was a pleasant departure from the norm. Stars two, three and four? That would be 
the potstickers, the hot and sour  
soup and the moo-shoo pork ( my all time fave growing up in New York).
 Star five goes to the service- we were greeted with a smile and our waiter didn't miss a step all the way through."}
{"text":"Really love the food. Choice of white, brown or fried rice with your meal. Also crispy noodles were thin and very crunchy. They serve coke and pepsi products which is great because me and my friends have different tastes in soda. Food came out hot and stayed very warm til the end. Portion size is perfect. Spring rolls rocked as well as the chicken chow mein we had. Good variety of veggies in sauce and lots of chicken.  We will be going back for sure. Best in Fountain Hills by far and NO MSG."}
{"text":"this is a wonderful place,service is friendly and food is amazing i love the hot sour soup and diamond shrimp,to eat   
here is an awesome deal."}
{"text":"I ordered a lunch special and the rice, chicken, spring roll and soup were perfect!!!!! They were courteous and nice and professional. Also had a smile on there face. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Impressed by the quality of our dinner last nite. We both enjoyed the appetizers and main dish we ordered. The service was very good also. About our third time here. We will continue to return here if all stays the same. Very reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"I get that this place caters to meat eaters, but I would love too see that they also cater to vegetarians and put their vegetarian options on the menu. The restaurant is very nice, food was good once I figured out that they can do tofu. I would feel more welcomed had there been an area for vegetarian dishes, less the one star for that. Where I have lived:Los Angeles and Hawaii, I have always experienced vegetarian options labeled at every Chinese place I've dined. I know that tofu plays a major role in authentic Chinese food, and comes in various forms like bean curd, etc. I feel that many Asian restaurants here in Scottsdale/Fountain Hills area is totally catered to Caucasians and sometimes lacks authenticity."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch this week.  Very nice inside.  Don't let the outside fool you.  I was a little apprehensive when I walked in at 11:40 for lunch and only saw 6 people.  I'll say it again. It's very nice inside.  I picked a lunch combo that included soup, 2 crab puffs, a spring roll, soft drink and Kung Po Chicken.  The spicy soup was fantastic.  Crab puffs and spring roll is obviously made to order and not pre-made.  The entr√©e was good also.  I was definitely full when I left.  Good quality food and pleasant waitstaff.  I'm will definitely return. The lunch combo is a great deal."}
{"text":"I've passed by it a hundred time since I've moved to Fountain Hills and from the outside it always looks empty and frankly not so inviting. After being burned by so many over priced and uninspired Fountain Hills restaurants we were very wary to eat here especially since the reviews weren't so glowing but we were feeling very adventurous so we decided to give it a try.

Right when we walked in we were greeted by a very friendly Chinese lady and seated right away. My hubby and I were pleasantly shocked because the restaurant was decorated nicely inside, very clean and the booths were in good condition.

We just wanted decent Chinese food and didn't want to have to drive to 25-30 minutes into Scottsdale to Phoenix to get it so we figured we'd try one of their lunch specials. We both got the bargain lunch price for the Kung Pao Chicken that was $8.99. This special came with 2 cream cheese puffs, a nice egg roll, hot and sour soup, a drink and the main entree which consisted of the Kung Pao and fried rice.

Everything from the soup to the entree came out hot and quickly and our waitress was very orderly in keeping our food rolling out. As far as the taste of the food, it was good enough for us to come back and try other things on the menu. It wasn't anything extraordinary as much as it satisfied our taste buds. My only thing that I believe that could be improved was the amount of chicken and peanuts actually in the entree. I'm not a big fan of an entree drowning in water chestnuts and bell peppers and having to hunt for the chicken. 

If you're looking for reasonably priced Chinese lunch special, good service and a clean establishment this so far fits the bill."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was awesome!!! The food, the service, just everything. Their shrimp fried rice was soooooooooo good!!!! Must try if you are in the area"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! Looks great and the food tastes great too! All I got the first time I went was egg drop soup and chicken lettuce wraps and I felt like they were both delicious. The lettuce wraps, to me, were better than Pei Wei. Not to dry and full of flavor. Cheap prices. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Fountain Hills and this was our first time ordering from Hao Restaurant.  We ordered on-line and the ordering process went flawlessly. The place was clean and organized and there were lots of people eating when I walked in. Seemed like a relaxed dining atmosphere.  Our food was all wrapped up, hot & ready when I walked in the door. They greeted me when I walked in and had me in and our in about a minute or two.  

We had the King Pao Chicken, Spicy Chinese Fried Rice, Spring Rolls & Hot & Spicy Soup.   Everything was freshly made and was delicious in every way.  The King Pau Chicken is pretty spicy (but not too spicy) so be advised.  The proportions were perfectly sized and priced well.  Included in the dinner was a generous portion of white rice, different sauces as well as cookies.  

My wife commented to me that this might be some of the best Asian food we've had in years. I agreed as I had seconds.  :)  

I definitely recommend Hao Restuarant.  This will be our regular \"go to\" place for good Asian food when in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Food: Good
Service: Good
Ambience: Great
Price: Reasonable"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years, last time was back when it was Ha Ha China. Ordered 2 lunch combos for carry-out...Sesame Chicken and Chicken Lo-Mein. Both came with egg drop soup, a spring roll, soy sauce, hot mustard, and a fortune cookie. Both were decent size portions, good flavor. Very reasonable pricing, restaurant is very clean inside. Like it!"}
{"text":"Hands Down the best Asian food in Fountain Hills. Consistently quick and fresh with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Easy phone order and pick up of shrimp fried rice. This second order tasted better than my first Sunday evening order. Generous portions and fresh! A tad of soy sauce and I was happy. The spring rolls were very good too. Come on you cheapo FH peeps,  support your local restaurants!"}
{"text":"This new restaurant in Fountain Hills is well worth the trip.  The best Chinese food anywhere!  The restaurant offers great atmosphere and a very pleasant, welcoming staff.  Great for groups, lunch or dinner.  The food is out of this world.  Everything is extremely fresh and our favorite place to go.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to get your Asian fusion fix. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable (coupons are available so the value goes up). I once had an issue with them forgetting to add some appetizers to my takeout order. Called them up, and the next time I ordered from them, they added it to my order (had to remind them though). Overall, a good place, definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"My parents wanted to try the new Chinese restaurant in their 'hood.
We had the following:
Wonton soup - decent flavor with pork and shrimp
Mongolian beef - savory brown sauce with veggies 
Hong Kong noodles - nicely cooked crispy noodles 
Chicken satay - marinated chicken with a spicy mustard suace
This is a great addition to the neighborhood, and the best Chinese in Fountain Hills that I've had to date. The server was really friendly and the restaurant was clean and modern."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in fountain hills. 
It's clean and remodeled. Everything on the menu is super inexpensive. The service is great. They are so fast on the takeout orders"}
{"text":"Second time in a month that we have been there, and again, not disappointed. We've tried different dishes each time with different guests and everyone was very happy with their food. Service was friendly, and employees very helpful. We won't wait this long again to go back!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Chinese meals I've ever had. My daughter's pad Thai tasted nothing like it should. My wife's sesame chicken was so thickly breaded that she couldn't slice the large chunks without a knife. My Kung pap chicken was left half eaten. And I was hungry!  The egg drop soup was very good"}
{"text":"Best Chinese/Asian fusion or whatever you want to call it in Fountain Hills. Super friendly, clean and always plenty of food. It can be a little pricey, but up in the hills you sometimes have to take what you can get and this is the best of the bunch."}
{"text":"Our favorite Asian restaurant in Fountain Hills. Very clean, food is fresh and flavorful. Their pork bun appetizers are unique, you fill them yourself, and absolutely delicious. All the appetizers are great! Also offer takeout."}
{"text":"I stopped to get carry out for the family on short notice. We had the sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken and vegetable fried rice. The portions where solid and flavorful. The service was quick and friendly. This was not the best Chinese food I have ever had but far better than any other I have had in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Always one of our favorite places.  Try the shrimp egg foo young."}
{"text":"The place smells like fresh paint, but it's clean. 

The server is attentive. The food was alright. My mom ordered some sort of walnut shrimp. It might have been better if it wasn't doused in the sauce. Her boyfriend ordered Kung Pao chicken, but it wasn't spicy at all - even I could eat it.

The crab puffs were delicious though!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Fountain Hills.. always fresh and very tasty! Staff is so friendly and accommodating. The have the best sizzling rice s"}
{"text":"\"Yelp never steers us wrong\" proclaimed DH when we started looking up Chinese restaurants whens we were driving back to Phoenix.  Well, I guess you can look at our meal at Hao two ways: either Yelp DID steer us wrong or we should have paid better attention to a phrase used in many of the Yelp reviews: \"best Chinese IN FOUNTAIN HILLS\".  Obviously, FH has a dearth of Asian restaurants.

As commented, the inside was MUCH more attractive and contemporary than the unpretentious exterior.  Dining room and bathrooms were VERY clean.  And of course it was empty, as it was 4 pm on a Sunday afternoon.  Oh, and our server was very nice and attentive.  (That's actually why they get 2 stars rather than one) So, I guess that leaves the food, right?

We started off with two appetizers---DS and I shared the crab puff and DH and DS's GF shared the egg rolls.  Actually, both were really good.  Fresh, hot, not greasy, tasty.  (But wait....)

Then we ordered entrees.  (Btw, hardly any entrees were more than 9.99, so I don't know what people were talking about this place being expensive)  I asked for Spicy Eggplant and Pork, DH got General Tso's chicken, DS got Sesame Chicken, and DS's GF got Vegetarian Chow Mein.  DS and I added the soup and eggroll---he got the egg drop and I got the hot and sour. (Additional $3 each)  Soup and eggrolls arrived promptly.  

He said his soup was okay, but \"didn't taste like anything\".  Same for my hot and sour.  The broth was a much paler brown than I am accustomed to with no depth of flavor.  There were a couple of small chunks of mystery meat and then giant peas and square carrots---like the kind you get in a freezer bag.  Not impressed.  However, the eggrolls were really good---no meat, but very fresh and well-cooked---but after a couple of bites, my son said \"Ugh\", and pulled about a 6 inch long hair out of his eggroll.  Yes, I know this kind of stuff happens and DS even made a joke, but basically, we both put our eggrolls down unfinished.  And no, we didn't say anything because DS was like: just forget it, Mom!

So the entrees arrived.  I was like uh-oh as soon as I saw DH's plate.  It literally had an entire can of water chestnuts in it.  He hates water chestnuts.  And maybe six 1 x 1 pieces of red pepper and the chicken.  DS's Sesame Chicken was exactly that: nuggets of fried chicken with a sticky sauce and sesame seeds.  DS GF's Veggie Chow Mein looked----remember that stuff you used to buy in a can with the little container of dry noodles?  I think we found out where all those extra cans went.  

And mine was okay.  Not spicy, not a lot of taste, but it was okay.  But everyone agreed their vegetables (except for DS, who had none) were either way over-cooked or had come out of a bag.  There was absolutely no \"tender-crisp crunch\" to them.  NOBODY cleaned their plate (a rarity among our crew) or asked for a take-away container.  

Consensus when we left: we'd rate our meals on average about 2.5 on a scale of 1 to 10.  DH gave the lowest score at a 1 (he'd wanted to do minus one, but he did enjoy his eggroll) and I gave the highest at 4 (It was food, it was hot, I didn't get sick).

But really---best Chinese food in Fountain Hills?  I'd just go to Senor Taco."}
{"text":"Okay, I'll start off by saying I'm biased. I use a single meal to be the yardstick by which I judge Chinese restaurants: Shrimp with lobster sauce. This restaurant doesn't serve it. They serve the variant I find in many Chinese restaurants in Phoenix: Shrimp in black bean sauce. So, there was no way they could get a 5. However, the Mongolian beef I got was fine. Not bad, but not great. Didn't enjoy the spring roll."}
{"text":"Excellent!  That's all I can say. I had orange chicken. Hot, well seasoned. The vegetarian fried rice that one had was also delicious. Service was quick and price was perfect. I even forgot to use my coupon. I am actually going around town with friends and smoking some of the local fare after we get \"beautified\". It makes for a fun afternoon."}
{"text":"I have gotten take out from here several times. The food is tasty and the staff is helpful and nice. The restaurant is always vey clean and they are quick & efficient."}
{"text":"I wanted chinese food close to fountain hills,but after hearing about some of the other places I was hesitant to try this one... 
When pulling up the menu I was impressed with the lunch choices, I called and placed my order and the woman who answered was polite and told me my order would be ready in ten minutes.. upon arrival I noticed there was only one couple in the restaurant... this made me nervous but the atmosphere was nice and everyone was really polite.
 I have to say I was rushing on the drive home because the food smelled amazing.
I ordered the curry chicken lunch special with hot and sour soup and the spicy pepper beef lunch special with eggdrop soup. (Yea its a lot for one person but I honestly didnt expect to like both so I figured at least one would be good)
I was SO pleasantly surprised when I opened the bag and everything was neatly packed (egg rolls in a seperate package so they dont get soggy) utensils, hot mustard and sweet and sour sauce. 
The food was SO SO SO good,  the chicken was definitely a fusion between thai and chinese, but it worked well and the chicken was moist and tender. The spicy pepper beef was also tender and spicy and quite frankly pretty amazing. The soups were just OK.. kind of bland for my taste but the eggrolls were the perfect balance between crisp and greasy!
I highly reccomend this place!"}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten here since they've open and recommended it to everyone we know. We absolutely love the food and the people here!! I am never not satisfied at Haos."}
{"text":"It tasted like microwaved Chinese food. Not
Impressed. No wonder we were the only table on a Saturday night. I bet locals avoid this place and I would too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick early dinner with very limited time. Friendly greeting, clean bright and comfortable. I let the waitress know I was short on time, she was very accommodating. Kung Pao Chicken was on the table in under 10 minutes. Flavors clean and light, I could have used a little more spice but could have been a function of rushing the dish (which I requested). Will be back."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Fountain Hills.  Very nice staff and great service!  Large menu and everything is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"At first I really liked this place but then they changed their chicken and it's not very good now.. The past 3 times I've been there I had throw my meal away."}
{"text":"Hao is the neighbor to the restaurant I work at, and anytime I'm a little early and forget my lunch I head over. My go to dish is the salt and pepper shrimp and they always give you plenty & the price is always right. It's always quite around the afternoon so maybe head over with a book and grab a booth! Their workers are friendly. A nice addition to fountain hills tiny food scene."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best lunch specials in town. You get a soup appetizer, and then a choice of an entree and rice for $5.99! Not to mention, the food is fantastic! This is a family run business, and I recommend you bring your entire family here too to enjoy this hidden gem. You will not be disappointed! 

Great price point!"}
{"text":"Hands-down, *the* very best Chinese food in all of Fountain Hills, in my humble opinion. I give them a 4.6582333 stars out of 5.

Yes, it's a little pricier than Chen's (downtown) or Ping's (on Shea Blvd), but the quality of food is better than the other two. I'm not quite sure how the service is, as I normally will call ahead and pick-up some take-out, but they're always friendly with me and never muddy up my precious order.

One of my favorites is their Kung Pao Shrimp, even though we live in the desert. I try not to think about this, because I really really miss my beloved shellfish. The seasoning is perfect, but I would like mine a bit spicier. 

Watch out for their main door handle during summer months; the sun beats down on the metal handle and could give you second-degree blisters on your paws!"}
{"text":"It's alright for American Chinese food.  Food tastes good and well presented.  They have vietnamese and thai food on the menu also (pho, pad thai, etc).  Lunch combo is a good deal.

Note the restaurant sits on a hill and just driving into the parking lot can damage the front of your cart.  The front of my rental car is falling off now after I got out to take a look.  So be careful especially if you are driving a nice new car and don't want it damaged.  I should have parked further away across the street.  It was my second time here and both times with two different rental cars the front of my car took a hit."}
{"text":"First time I've been to this restaurant. Looks inviting. My 'ToGo' order, Wor Won Ton Noodle soup was ready for pickup at the time specified. The person behind the counter was friendly and attentive.
When I got home, the soup was still piping hot. The wontons where good, but I've had better. They still tasted good. The broth was flavorful which came with little amount of greens, some carrot slices, 4 shrimp that were fresh and not sure how
Many wontons. The noodles were cooked just right, it reminded me of the noodles in Campbell's chicken/beef noodle soups.
Plan on trying their sit down menu in the near future

{"text":"This place is what I call an Asian Delight, because of the Variety of Asian foods. This is truly a gem in this small town, just off of Saguaro Blvd. The decor is very simple inside and the staff seem to be on it when it comes to drinks and orders. This restaurant has everything you need to be the top Asian Cuisine in Fountain Hills"}
{"text":"Have been back many times since my last review and everything is sparkling clean, food is still very good and my favorite waitress is the best. You won't be sorry you gave this place a try."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to say that I finally found a recommendation-worthy Chinese restaurant in FH; unfortunately, that's NOT the case here.  I started small this first visit &ordered the Lettuce Wraps and Egg Drop Soup. Can't go wrong, right? Wrong!

Lettuce Wraps:  Opened the box to find 3 leaves of lettuce & the \"fixings\". And by \"leaves\" I mean: exceptionally tiny, greenish/white \"leaf-lettes\"from an apparent mini-head of lettuce. Being that Lettuce Wraps are usually eaten by \"wrapping\" the lettuce around the fixings (hence the name), it was a futile experience to attempt to WRAP the baby leaflettes around anything!! 

Egg Drop Soup: I should admit that I often drive to Jade Palace on 92nd & Shea JUST for the Egg Drop Soup; it's THAT good! So while the bar was set high, I still thought it achievable. 

#1. It's Egg Drop Veggie Soup. Which is fine, if you like a really \"meaty\" spoonful of egg-drop soup - which I do not!  Here's what I found i: beans, pea pods, cucumber, green onion, white onion, carrots, and some lovely mushy tofu. It was LOADED.

Here's what was NOT in the Egg Drop Soup: Anything resembling a lovely, rich egg-drop FLAVOR!

In conclusion: Two major mis-fires. Far enough off the mark that I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'm From Chicago and spoiled. When you have China town and the top Restaurants in the country then come to Fountain Hills  and eat at Hao not once but three x's  the service was horrific and Rita the owner is not tentative towards her customers. 

I'm paying good $$ for my food and expect good service and certainly don't want to beg for a refill of water or another cocktail. The food is ok but the prices are expensive. 

I will continue to eat at Jade Garden in Scottsdale on 90th and Shea.  Rita needs to wait on her customers much better and improve on the prices of their food .  John C. Chicago"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. We love it so much that we frequently order (for take out) and its is consistently great. They are very efficient and our order is always correct. The staff is friendly as well. We haven't eaten within the restaurant yet as we've always ordered it out, but plan to soon. The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I liked this place !  I am a fan for sure.  Very Reasonable prices.  My wife's Mu Shu Pork was flavorful and well presented.  The hot and Sour soup is good,  Great lunch menu.  I agree with Krista P.  the lettuce wraps were better then Pei Wei.  They put some money into the decor and the ambiance is nice.  The wait staff is very attentive and friendly.  Their shrimp dishes were good.  No skimping on quantity or quality here.  We have come back for take out twice now."}
{"text":"One word \"AMAZING\" !  We had dinner here for the first time.  Food was fresh and hot.  I ordered the singapore noodles. Incredible flavor!  My husband had kung pow chicken. Not too spicy."}
{"text":"So this restaurant is where Ha Ha China used to be. In walking in, the decor is very nice and everyone was fairly friendly. I was a little disappointed with the menu, however. Pretty much all of the Chinese/Asian Fusion restaurants I have been to have a vegetarian section of their menu. Not so at Hao. They have a section for beef, chicken, seafood, noodles, and rice. 

I was able to order an item off of the beef menu and substitute tofu for the beef, which was nice. 

I ordered spicy tofu with peppers. The sauce had a really nice flavor to it and it came out hot and not over cooked. 

The service was ok. We ordered an appetizer that we never received but other than that, it was pretty good. Three people ate for under $30, which was nice."}
{"text":"When this place opened to replace Ha-Ha China, my family and I really wanted it to be our go-to Asian restaurant. Unfortunately, that won't be the case. We've eaten here twice, and both times received a cold reception from who we assume is the owner, but observed a totally different treatment given to Caucasian customers. The owner seems to be biased against non-Chinese Asian people. That's totally okay since the food is sub-par anyway. Go to Flo's instead where the food and service are so much better."}
{"text":"Food was below average taste-wise. Vietnamese spring rolls had one lonely piece of mint inside to add flavor to vermicelli and lettuce... Mongolian beef was ok. Yu Shiang chicken gelatinous and not very flavorful. Table was sticky... the young man serving us was nice!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh hot and delicious. Service was great! Very clean. We had lettuce cups, sesame chicken lunch special and orange chicken lunch special, it was all really good, crab puffs were the best I have ever eaten. Prices were very good"}
