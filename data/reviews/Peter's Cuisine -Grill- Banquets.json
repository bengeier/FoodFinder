{"text":"Nothing but great, positive things to say about this place. The new owners care so much about creating the best possible dining experience for their guests. My friends and I love the quality and the love behind their food and the staff is nothing short of personable and friendly. They truly make you feel like family. Please stop in and support Peter's."}

{"text":"Really good food - tuna for 1 entree and chicken vodka pasta.  Great location in the former Buster's Restaurant.

The only negative I have is the kids menu - they don't seem to really want kids with $12 kids menu of food, drink and ice cream (though it was good food for the kid, my other child ordered the excellent and plentiful pasta off the lunch menu for $12.)  With that price, I almost wish it was like other restaurants that just did not have a kids menu (at least I would have leftovers).

Hope this place lasts with the good food as I miss Busters and this restaurant is in an unbeatable location."}
{"text":"The ambiance is wonderful, inside and outside seating. 
Menu is a bit small and they were out of the mushroom bisque when I was there for lunch.
The salmon and the house salad were fresh and prepared just right. It seemed a bit pricey, but location and decor are really good. Lovely quiet French music, lake views, lovely.
I looked at the happy hour menu and I'll be back for that!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is a GEM... We didn't come here with any expectations except to have a nice dining experience, but what we ended up having was a VIP experience. We were treated to wonderful food, live music, outdoor patio ambiance, and it was lovely to be right near the water. Two french chefs delighted us with tantalizing entrees from the diverse menu (the rack of lamb was cooked to perfection)! Terry (Owner) and Jake (GM), talked with us about the revitalization of the restaurant from it's previous state and the from what we can see they are headed in the right direction. I don't have any experience running a restaurant, but I know how I like to feel when I go to one. The food, service, and overall hospitality from the moment we walked in to the time we walked out was exceedingly superb. We will be back on a regular basis to Peter's!!"}
{"text":"Came into the Grand reopening of the restaurant. Loved the new paint job looked much better (more alive) than the red that was there before. The food was very good i had the Filet medium rare with mashed potatoes and green peppercorn sauce and it was cooked Beautiful. My girlfriend had the Seabass and Fingerling Potatoes and she loved it. The server was very good (Jake) he new all the special and what wines paired with all the foods on the menu.  Will definitely come back and enjoy more food and drinks."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat tonight, and decided to try Peter's because we love the old Buster's patio. Kind of shocking to walk in on Friday at 5pm and have no one there. It was truly dead. Not even music on in the dining area. We ate out on the patio and luckily hit happy hour. The bruschetta was ok, as were the sliders. The burgers really didn't have much flavor. We had french onion soup, then the poached pear for dessert--which was awesome. While the ambiance is nice (live music started out there, which was very nice), and the servers were friendly, everything took a VERY long time. We had to order the wine and appetizers twice from two different servers, it took forever to get our food, then when we ordered dessert, we asked for decaf coffee which came about 10 minutes after the dessert was gone. Then another 10 minutes later got the check. They just seemed very disorganized (although, like I said, friendly). I'm not sure if I'd go back, except it's such a lovely patio. My guess is they won't last long at this rate."}
{"text":"We have known this space for more than 15 years, and were told that the latest incarnation, after Buster's and Bistro du Lac, was good.  Armed with a Groupon, we dined with friends on a Thursday night in late October and were underwhelmed.  The ambience could only be described as \"dead\" and the wait staff had little charisma.  We dine out in Scottsdale at least twice a week and feel that the prices (example $28 for grilled salmon) are too high in relation to the fittings and ambience.  

The quality of the food is OK, though the mussels in the appetizer were tiny.  The wine prices aren't unreasonable."}
{"text":"First, the patio is one of the most delightful spots in the Phoenix area. Second the staff were friendly, helpful, and professional. Third the quality of anchovies with the Caesar salad were excellent. The food in general was very good except perhaps a bit too much cooking time for my asparagus. The prices are reasonable, too. My only negative is the smell of grease inside. This restaurant - under different names - has been in use for many years, and the odor is becoming problematic. Still, I'll certainly return for another fine lunch by the water."}
