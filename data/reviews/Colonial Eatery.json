{"text":"It had been 9 years since the last time I ate here. All I can say price is great and food of my gosh yummiest in Ohio. A hidden gem that not very touristy which is great. Love the waiting and service provided. I wish they would show California a thing or two on how to make a real Ruben."}
{"text":"The food was ok nothing special. It smelled like a dirty bathroom or porta potty. They should invest in some cleaning products."}
{"text":"Excellent all you can ear fish fry and clam chowder at a reasonable price.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great local diner. The food is good the service is great. Very cheap and great quality I've only came here once or twice but I will definitely be back if your in the area and want to grab breakfast with a buddy this is the place to come to."}
{"text":"Best fish fry in town!  Tasty fish that's not over breaded, crispy fries that have a buttery flavor or get the local church made pirogies, my fav. The meal starts with soup and ends with jello or their tasty rice pudding.  The place is packed so don't be in a hurry but worth the wait! Oh yeah, it's all u can eat fish !"}

{"text":"Food was excellent, cooked in a timely manner. The service was also fantastic. The ladies were friendly and checked on us when needed. We never had an empty cup of coffee. First time dining and I would definitely return soon."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5pm on a Friday for their fish fry based on the previous review. We were seated immediately. I saw a sign for it up front but it was not on the menu that I could fine - luckily the waitress pointed it out (abbreviated as \"A.U.C.E.\"). For $7.95 you get a bowl of soup (chicken noodle or clam chowder) or salad, fries or two pierogies, unlimited fish and jello or rice pudding. The clam chowder was edible. The pierogies were delicious and I wish there were more of those. The fish was tasty, not overly greasy, though had some odd air pockets between breading and meat.  With soda, tax and tip the two of us were out for under $25 and so stuffed we took home two pieces of fish and passed on the included dessert. The waitress was friendly if a bit mechanical, though she seemed to know many of the other patrons. Atmosphere is truly eclectic. Overall we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nothing great, nothing terrible. Very basic breakfast menu items, with nothing that really stands out. At times, that's exactly what I'm looking for, but not usually. If you want a quick and decent breakfast I'd recommend here."}
{"text":"Definitely the place to go for breakfast. The food is good and the price is right. The only problem with this place is that the service is slowwwwww"}
{"text":"in short:  Colonial's makes a good omelete!  i came here on a Saturday for breakfast, and upon walking in, found a bustling diner with a mom-'n-pop feel.  the breakfast menu had a diverse selection of omeletes, and other standard breakfast diner fare.  definitely value priced.  i decided to take the plunge on an Italian omelete, and it was great-- spinach and red peppers, and sized to fill you up past lunch.  and while i personally do not consider myself a big homefry guy (but would still feel cool if someone called me that), i actually liked the homefries here-- they're fresh, and they're the flakes kind, not the cubes kind.  service was acceptable;  didn't feel neglected.  didn't feel neglected by the locals, either.  don't be surprised if you find yourself engaging in conversation with people on the next table over.  me:  [working on my laptop, munching on omelete]  Random Parma Guy 1:  [looks at me]  \"whatcha workin' on-- homework?\"  [hearty chuckle]  me:  \"no sir, just typing up some stuff.\"  (this review, actually)  Random Parma Guy 2:  \"i don't like computers.  they're replacing newspapers.\"  Random Parma Guy 1:  \"they're taking away jobs!!\"  Random Parma Guy 2:  [even more excitedly] \"they're taking away jobs!!!\"  me:  [slinks back in seat, closing laptop]   stop using your computer right now.  you're taking away jobs."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local breakfast places. Skip the chain restaurants and come here. Good selection of food, good prices and fast service. Try the \"Two for the Money\" or \"Western Skillet\""}
{"text":"Ate at the Colonial for the first time on 2/22/14. My sister and I take my kids out every Saturday and we try to hit a different eatery each week to try something new so we have had a lot of good and bad over the years. The place is filthy. We sat in the back room which was pretty bad with light fixtures hanging from open wires in the ceiling. The men's bathroom was flooded. The service was terrible. Our waitress never came back with cream or sugar for our coffee so we had to steal it from another table. We had to ask 3 times for more coffee. My son ordered the Corned Beef Hash which the menu claims is \"homemade\" but it is most certainly Dinty Moore from a can. It looked and tasted like dog food. Our Omelets were were hard and over-cooked, not light and fluffy at all. Mine had canned mushrooms, really gross. The boys wanted cheese on their eggs and got a partially melted processed cheese slice on top. YUCK. Our toast was a joke. The Colonial obviously saves the full slices of bread for the sandwiches and uses the tiny heals of the bread for breakfast toast. My rye toast was barely bigger than a crouton. Prices are comparable to most places we have visited, certainly not any cheaper and for what you get, definitely NOT worth your money. We will never go back. VERY DISPLEASED!!!"}
{"text":"met a buddy for breakfast  here, before a business meeting. it was his pick and i was a bit reluctant about the choice, but glad i was wrong!!!! service is friendly, inside is small, typical neighborhood restaurant setting. i had the \"george's special\". a large potato pancake topped with canadian bacon, eggs and cheese.........that potato pancake was SO freakin' awesome!!! i am still thinking about it............glad that i was introduced to this little local neighborhood gem!!!"}
{"text":"Had the best build your own omelet here. It was very large size and very tasty for a decent price. Clean and friendly place. Would go there again."}
{"text":"I went here once for lunch with my grandpa. He likes a lot of these mom and pop eateries.  At first glance, the menu is of typical mom and pop diners, especially in those in Parma: no or minimal healthy or vegetarian options, a couple types of burgers, a couple types of basic pastas, and some 'Eastern European' influence including kielbasa, pirogies, gyros, and chicken marsala.   But, what was this.... Hummus in Parma ?! Falafels ?! That was the first time I ever seen a middle-eastern dish on a Parma menu.  I couldn't believe it. I was immediately skeptical...  We went during a dead afternoon, so I can't really vouch for service [literally only one other table]. I had the pierogies, filled with American cheese, not doughy, sprinkled with parsley on top. I also had the chicken noodle soup which was salty, typical of these mom and pop placees. The food was all right, especially for the price. 2 dinners with a soup or salad were under a total of $20.   This joint in Parma is pretty useful, especially if you're around the Ridge Park Square area, which is dominated by chains. On the way out, I read a newsarticle highlighting this place, run by a Lebanese family: I should have tried the hummus."}
{"text":"It was Lent and Friday so we were looking for a fish fry in Parma.  I shopped around on yelp and consulted with my wife.  My wife recommended the Colonial because she knows the owner and his family and heard they offer all-you-can-eat fish fry.  So off we went.    It turns out that the Colonial offers an all-you-can-eat fish fry every Friday night.  Awesome!  So we ordered the fish fry.  My daughter ordered the chicken parmesan.  My daughter's dinner was served with a side salad and we received chicken noodle soup.  The soup was light on the noodles, but hearty and warming, nonetheless.  The fish and the breading were tasty.  The fish was well cooked and tasted great.  When we asked for more fish, the waitress said that we didn't order the all-you-can-eat fish fry.  We didn't realize there were two because no one told us and it wasn't on the menu.  Who orders the regular one anyway?  She brought us more fish and said it would be our little secret and didn't charge us for it.  My daughter's chicken parmesan was tasty and well cooked.  It was covered in cheese and the marinara sauce was good.  The side of ravioli was also yummy.  The Colonial is in a state of transformation and when they finish it, it will be a great diner!  They could use a couple more waitresses on Friday nights during Lent."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My family has been coming here for as long as I can remember.  I've come to know the owner on a first name basis and he's just the nicest guy on the planet.  The food is always delicious. This place is ridiculously affordable, with exceptional quality. It's a diner that shines through other diners with a similar motif. If you are in the area, there really isn't any other diner you should even contemplate visiting. This is it. Hands down."}
{"text":"Friendly service at a good price... and they have WiFi!  Unlike many other eateries, they do have a decent selection of foods that aren't fat-laden.  So if you're trying to eat healthy, you will have options to choose from.  Did I mention that they have WiFi? I'll say it again, simply because there aren't many Mom-and-Pop style restaurants that provide this.  This bumps them up to the five-star category, as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast from the airport. It's right off the highway I480 ridge road exit. Ask for Melissa. The breakfast was great."}
