{"text":"We came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast. The food was okay, but the service was slow and unattentive. It also was rather pricey for a just okay breakfast."}
{"text":"The pumpkin pancakes were excellent. They came topped with pecans and carmel sauce. I ordered a side of corned beef and changed it to bacon after seeing it on the next table. The sliced corned beef was very fatty (marble-like).  I'll surely go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"A group of us had a late breakfast here this Sunday. The atmosphere was warm and comfortable, service was excellent, food was good and reasonably priced. I had the corned beef breakfast and the portion was generous. The oatmeal came with lots of sides to add including nuts.. I would come back here for breakfast if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic find, not far from the tollway. Sandwich was perfect melt-in-your-mouth. Definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Yum!  Great sandwiches, adorable place with real characters and terrible coffee.  CBC is the complete package."}
{"text":"Wait staff friendly. Food was terrible. As well as it took forever."}
{"text":"I'm personally not a fan of Corned Beef so i haven't tried any of their sandwitches, but def a stop for their Breakfast/Brunch. You get ALOT of food for cheap!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast in the city!  Corned beef is great too! Our sales team has been going to breakfast on occasion and have been trying different places.  None of them are even close to CBC! I wish it was closer to the office so I could convince everyone to meet there!  I brought in a somewhat famous touring band from L.A. and they raved about how good it was too! They actually know how to cook and don't overcharge."}
{"text":"I go there every Wednesday for the Chicken Dumpling soup. Just terrific. I have had only good sandwiches here and the daily specials are generally worth considering. Heather, our very friendly waitress, is excellent, anticipating our needs at every turn. A nice hometown type of place; not flashy, just good."}
{"text":"I love near the CBC and have been there maybe 4 times over the past two years. Decided today to write my first review on them hoping they monitor Yelp.   Breakfasts are pretty decent. No complaints about eggs, bacon, pancakes and so on. Probably give them a solid 3 stars.  However.   Today I was in the mood for corned beef. Let's see, should I go to Slyman's? Too far to go today and ditto for Corky & Lenny's. Wait! I know, maybe I could find a place nearby that's actually NAMED after it! Well, duh.  The bad news: This was THE worst corned beef I have ever eaten, and that includes CB from restaurants where \"mediocre\" would be a major accomplishment.  Not only did it taste bad, but it smelled (sorry CBC, but we Yelp for truth not BS) like dishwater, and I kid you not.  Certainly not saying the smell was from dishwater, just that that's what it smelled like. Double plus ungood. It was almost bad enough to make me turn around and let them know in person how terrible it was. But, I had to be somewhere at a certain time and couldn't do it.   How bad was it? Had I seen a homeless person I wouldn't have given it to him/her. NOBODY needs to eat that crap.   Look, as mentioned, I don't go there a lot so can't say that this was or wasn't an anomaly. Let's hope so for their sake.  Otherwise, they need to change their name to \"The Any Sandwich But Corned Beef Cafe.\"   Seriously."}
{"text":"My family lives nearby. Every time I visit them we come here for breakfast. They just lost their lease, and there's a rumor that they will re-open under a different name nearby. I heard it may be Flo's, named for the owners grandmother. Nice peoplr, and good food. We will continue to support them when they re-open!!!"}
{"text":"Convenient location near home. Good for a greasy breakfast.  Pay attention to how they cook their eggs on the menu.  Service is friendly and accomodating!"}
{"text":"It might seem odd to mention putrefaction or vile bacterial food corruption in a five star review but I feel I must. You see, if nothing else, the Corned Beef Café is clean. You'll not find a world of filth and degradation here in this lonely place deep in the unsettled bowels of forlorn Broadview Heights.   Harshly hungover and shaking like a character from a Cormac McCarthy novel, I entered this place with low expectations and sat myself near the window. I could see my car outside, caked in mud from the night before. While pondering what my blacked-out mind could no longer retrieve related to the cause of the muddy caved-in driver side door, I paused long enough to order coffee and a corned beef omelet. Rye toast. The waitress, it seemed, saw past my disheveled and foul personal appearance and sought from me a glimpse of my soul. She smiled despite my smell and crusted lapel-front and got me a cup of good strong coffee.   The coffee here is therapeutic and deeply gratifying. Get past that shaky first sip or two and you might just feel up to adding some sugar or artificial cream from a plastic lidded cup. Do it. Your body needs the help that stabilizers and gelling agents can bring to a deeply damaged and foundering brain. Breathe. Focus on the pain and you will master it. The beautiful waitress refills the cup without being asked. The omelet arrives hot and it is better than good. It is clean. Like everything else in this small window-fronted diner, it is a haven of cleanliness in a nasty ugly world.   Outside, the pickup trucks and roadkill and oil-slicked puddles of pooled sour rainwater await you. But here, in this place, at this moment, your past is behind you and your now is clean and focused and improving with every bite and every sip.  The Corned Beef Café is inspiring and deeply connective and I hope, no matter how bad your last night was, you will go there and save your soul."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for a long time. It was great corned beef. Had just a Reuben and water water w lemon.  Staff was friendly. Price was ok for the size of the sandwich. I'd come here again to get my food coma on."}
