{"text":"Honestly the best authentic Peruvian flavour in the city, I have tried almost all the restaurants in Toronto and always left with sadness, thinking that I will never be able to enjoy a real flavour from home until this morning!!!

I had papa rellena, empanadas and tamales, brought home arroz con pollo and I will go back to try the Lurin breakfast.

The best place in Toronto if you want to enjoy AUTHENTIC Peruvian food!!!"}
{"text":"This little nook reminded me of my mom's Peruvian home cooking. Delicious and freshly made on the spot. The ceviche is beautifully served and the chicken tamale was so savory. The owner was such an inviting and friendly host and chatted with us. The service was A+."}
{"text":"Have you ever felt like you wanted to try authentic food and have that heart felt warm welcome to try something new or  from back home in Péru ?. Well, Latin taste is your ticket to an introduction of magnificent flavours and textures of south american cuisine, that go beyond your stereotypical idea of Spanish food. This little nook has $2 freshly oven baked empanadas, That come filled with a selection of either cheese and spinach, pork, chicken, and beef.  I've tried them all and the flakiness of the warm empanadas with its fillings are very tasty indeed, leaving you to crave for more. 
For the avid foodie the ceviché (which is only sold on weekends along with other authentic Péruvian cuisine) is so delicious and mouthwatering you wont go anywhere but Latin taste to try it. (Even if you never had this dish in the first place, it should be here). A definitive recommended hot spot for Torontontian foodies alike."}
{"text":"Great food especially the tamales with the onion salad on the side. The alfajores and empanadas remind me of back home. Great place, great service! I would definitely recommend Latin Taste!"}
{"text":"A few friends recommended this place and I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed.  The food was great and the service was better. Try the empanadas and you will definitely leave happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"Feeling snacky in the market? You've found your spot! 

Latin Taste is a tight little shop on Baldwin Street with some beautiful counters of food. I came in recently, just a little peckish, and I ordered up a chicken and jalapeno empanada. That savoury little pocket of goodness was just what I needed to get through the hard times. Perfect size with the perfect amount of spice. It came simply, in a white paper bag. Again I use the word \"perfect\", but it was a perfect handheld piece of food. 

Thank you."}
{"text":"I have had the churros here while walking around Kensington market and they are great. I think they make everything in house and it always tastes great to me. 

They have an excellent  selection of baked Latin American goods, most of which I don't understand but know are delicious and still warm from when they where baked.  

Service is always an issue as they get supper busy, and have a tiny shop so having even 3 customers at one time can be a bit much."}
{"text":"This is literally home cooking. I was greeted by two sweet Peruanas who took care of me. I watched them prepare specialty items and cooked the food I wanted (aji de gallina) right in front of me. This is mostly a bakery, but they also prepare some entrees depending on the day and availability. It seems best to call ahead and see what is available. My peruvian fiance absolutely loved the food and said it simply couldn't be any better/authentic. 

this is not a sit down restaurant, there are a couple of places to sit but definitely not for actual dining. 

Craving peruvian? this is it! bonus its near chinatown!"}
{"text":"During an afternoon walk in the area, my friend and I saw the food being eaten on the little patio sets in front of the shop.  Everyone said the food was delicious so we had to give it a go!

We ordered the ceviche (only available on weekends) and the soup of the day.  

All I can say is \"WOW\".  

The ceviche was a well portioned plate of fish, sweet potatoes, Peruvian corn, and plantain chips, topped with some pickled veg.  It was fresh and flavourful!  I was surprised by how filling it was.  

The soup.  OMG.  It was a hearty seafood soup with clams, mussels, fish, calamari, and topped off with a shrimp.  The flavour was incredible!  We were so lucky to have ordered it because we received the last portion of the day.  At least 6 people came in asking for soup but they were officially sold out.  

I wonder how often they make this soup because I'm coming back for more!  

Fantastic local business.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Small shop in Kensington. Just dropped in for an empinada and chose the beef and jalapeno. Simple ground beef and mild spicy flavour. At $3.00, t'was quite nice."}
{"text":"We walked by this place and it looked amazing. The next day we made it a point to have lunch here. The empanadas were excellent and their tamale was super! The place is tiny but we snagged one of the tables outside, which made for wonderful people watching and listening to street performers. Definitely a must-try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place to get a cheap snack if you're walking around in Kensington market. 

They have a couple little chairs and tables outside. Not good for a group. 

Friendly service. 

Great and tasty empanadas ."}
{"text":"Best empanadas. Home made. Order the chicken or chicken jalapeño. Chef Ramos super kind."}
{"text":"One small table so no place to really sit.  No line.  Choice of 3 types for savory pies:  beef, chicken or spinach.  $3.

Beef:  delicious and was surprised to taste something like green olives.

Pastry was baked perfectly."}
{"text":"I love this place. There are very few argentine food places in town and their empanadas are just like my mom makes (and at just $2.50, they are the most affordable in kensington!). Home away from home! The Sandwiches de Miga aren't all that great and a bit overpriced but they're good for the occassional indulgence ;)"}
{"text":"Literally a hole in the wall, but this Latin quick service counter is worth the visit to Kensington market. Must try the chicken empanadas and make sure you get dozen to share with your friends, if you don't have any friends, you will, if you share with some strangers. There were other menu items but I did not try anything else, but based on the 2 lovely ladies behind the counter providing a friendly and authentic experience, I will be back to try everything."}
{"text":"We walked by Latin Taste during our trip to Kensington Market and decided to stop for some empanadas. We had a chicken one and it was really good. The skin was flakey and thin - just the way we both like our empanadas. 

They also sell alfajores! I recently learned about these soft, sweet \"cookies\" and fell in love with them."}
{"text":"Walked in to the warm smell of empanadas baking this morning. The lady who server me was quick and super friendly. Tried both the cheese and spinach and chicken. So delicious! Definitely coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Came by here on a cold Friday afternoon and tried their churros! Amazing and very fresh! The ladies who work here are so polite and nice.  They do only have 3 seats though, and the actual shop is tiny, so it's definitely better to walk around and eat at the same time!"}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled upon this small place while exploring Kensington Market. Had a pretty good spinach empanada (quite a few other flavors were available, too) but the ALFAJORES were TO DIE FOR! Yummy goodness! Dough just as crumbly as it should be and dulce de leche just as gooey as I remember from down south. There were two types available - we had the one with coconut (photo uploaded). At just $2 a piece, these alfajores were a fantastic find. I'll definitely stop by here again next time I'm in Toronto.

The place is closed Sundays and Mondays. There is a table and 2 chairs inside, but you can easily eat this stuff on the go, as well. In addition to empanadas and amazing alfajores, the ladies here also sell tamales, tortas / pies, sandwiches, and more."}
{"text":"A (Peruvian) friend (yes, that needed to be called out..as an testament to authenticity!) brought some goodies from here so I can only offer my take on the food. 

Tamales - he brought over a selection and all were good, but the one that stood out was actually the quinoa/veggie tamale. It seemed solely made of quinoa (vs masa), and the flavour was remarkable! I couldn't put my finger on it, but it went beyond the typical cilantro flavoured tamales verdes. A definite \"must-try\"!

Empanadas - the fillings were tasty and flavourful, although I wish there was slightly more.  

My friend said everything there was very authentic tasting - Will be definitely returning for more tamales!"}
{"text":"Had the spinach empanadas.....OMG!  Delish....went back and got more....plus the querros was tasty as well.  Lovely lady who served me.   Food was fresh and warm.  Able to sit outside as well."}
{"text":"Saw this place by chance, and I made a note to visit sometime soon. I was glad that I dropped by this place to escape the cold!

I bought a spinach empanada($2.50) and alfajore for dessert($2). Although the empanada was hot and fresh, the filling was quite small- there was more dough than the filling. I would not have minded if the empanada was smaller. However, alfajore was good! I liked the flaky crust and smooth dulce de leche filling. 

The service was so-so. A lady was on the phone, so she was distracted while serving me. 

By the way, there are no chairs inside, so you need to grab your order and eat them on the go. 

I am not sure I would be back, but you should check it out at least once!"}
{"text":"After running out of patience in the past because I was mislead by google maps, I've finally found the place! Small little shop with a very small capacity. Shop had a home feel to the shop.

Knew I had to try the empanadas but was overwhelmed by the large selection of fillings. Asked for the recommendation and the lady steered me towards the beef and the chicken. Decided I had to grab a churro and managed to snag the last caramel. 

Empanadas were simple but packed with full meat flavours that were well seasoned. Firm shell on the outside with a generous portion of meat. Churro was crispy and well flavoured. Definitely keen on coming back and trying the remaining flavours of the empanadas and churros."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday during lunch time for the empanadas and the alfajores.

We dropped by around noon and they ran out of spinach empanadas! We got the chicken instead, which was still good but not mind blowing - which means I will have to go back to try the spinach ones soon.

The alfajore was surprisingly not overwhelmingly sweet! The look of it was deceiving - it wasn't one of those \"one bite is enough\" kind of desserts, but one is enough to share between two people.

The ladies who worked there were very friendly. Authentic and local store to visit in the Kensington market!"}
{"text":"Being half Peruvian, I come here almost weekly. Amazing corn cakes with caramel and coconut sprinkles! also cold inca kola :)"}
