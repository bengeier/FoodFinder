{"text":"Good quality. Delicious food. Great environment!! This is one of my favorite places to go eat. It's a cute, little Chinese restaurant. You can definitely taste the quality in the meats! They are also able to modify anything! From light sauce and oil to pretty much your own creative dish! My personal favorites are the chicken and broccoli, beef w/ garlic sauce, and any of their noodle dishes!"}
{"text":"The food and amount of options in this place is amazing, I'm pretty sure both vegans and others will find something delicious. Absolutely not your typical Chinese restaurant, the food is prepared with high attention to detail and is super fresh.
Service was great too, will come back for more!"}
{"text":"I am SO excited that they made the change to be vegan/vegetarian friendly. Guess what they have been vegan for years themselves!!! We got to try the ma po tofu & the veggie lo mein it was DELICIOUS! To all my Charlotte & surrounding area veggies lovers we need to support them...the staff is welcoming & will help you make the perfect meal selection."}
{"text":"Maybe I caught them on a bad night but this was some of the worst Chinese food I have ever had! The crab wontons were stale and all I could taste was the oil they were fried in. The sesame chicken was the same. Very very disappointed :-/"}
{"text":"1st time there, waited for simple fired rice meal more than 10 mins while they were cleaning then the got home and ended throwing it out. Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Ma Ma Wok is a jewel.  If you look around most of the other businesses in the little strip mall come and go overnight yet Ma Ma remains.  There's a reason.  The place is very well run and obviously cared for by the folks behind it.  It's always clean and things are consistently busy.  They get good food out hot and fresh.  And it's consistently excellent.  We've tried many of the dishes without a disappointment.  Some of the dishes are on par with the best Chinese food I've had (Seattle, San Francisco, Vancouver).  Most are at least on par with any other Chinese place in town.  If you're a snob, this place is not for you.  It's simple, spartan decor is about efficiency not elegance.  If you dine in you might sit between landscapers and lawyers.  And if you do dine in, or carry out, or have your food delivered, don't hesitate to ask for what you want.  They can modify most of their orders with great ease and are happy to do so.  If you are in the Blakeney area do yourself a favor and give Ma Ma a try."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around.  Definitely take out rather than dine in but that's okay.  The food is terrific and the people are nice. Haven't ever been unhappy with anything we've ordered. Food is always fresh, delicious,  and hot. They now offer online ordering (very easy and convenient) and home delivery.  We've tried other Chinese restaurants over the years but always come back here. Definitely our favorite!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from there. Girl on the phone was nice but that was only plus. Got 3 different items and all were terrible. Chicken was rubbery and fatty. No flavor.  Sorry won't go back. All dinners thrown away"}
{"text":"They are consistently good.  We've had a few order glitches....but they deliver, they are fast, and we've only had a dish or 2 we didn't like (that was just our preference).  We order from here a few times a month when we just aren't going to cook...and too tired of pizza."}
{"text":"We just ordered food from here for the first time. It was not good at all. I upgraded my rice, which had absolutely no taste, to roast pork fried rice and I counted 5 pieces of pork in the entire order. The fried chicken wings were very salty and they took over an hour to deliver. This is the first order from them and it will be my last."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! It's not often you find Chinese foods that has vegan options, let alone all vegan! Friendly owner and staff, defiantly worth going!"}
{"text":"great Chinese food cooked and served quickly. very pleasant staff.  bare bones seating area, but they make it up in the quality and taste of the food."}
{"text":"Have been ordering delivery from here for years and we really liked it. Was disappointed they went vegetarian / vegan.  While I can see it would make sense to offer those options, eliminating meat and substituting with meat flavored alternatives seems to be a poor business choice. 6 months or less before they go out of business or go back offering real chicken, real beef, real pork."}
{"text":"Completely out of control order fulfillment process. Worst service. No offer of any compensation or apology."}
{"text":"Use to have some of the best Chinese food in charlotte. However switching to vegetarian has really brought down the quality of food. Overall the quality of food now is nowhere what it used to be. I could understand adding so vegan options, but getting rid of some of your most popular menu options has mad mama wok lose a lot of loyal customers."}
{"text":"It's so refreshing to see this restaurant go fully vegan, and to finally have a fully vegan Chinese restaurant in Charlotte! It's rare that I can go out to a Chinese restaurant and be able to eat everything off the menu. Every time I've come here the food has been really good, and the servers are always so nice. Would definitely recommend checking it out"}
{"text":"Yuk.  Not even one good dish.  Soggy eggrolls, watery soup, dry fried rice, General Tso's chicken was just fried with little taste.  Chow fun noodles clumped together.  Wanted this to be good so badly.  Charlotte really lacking good Chinese Food."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian and vegan options, so delicious that even meat eaters can enjoy! My boyfriend and I don't eat meat and usually have to resort to tofu and veggies at Chinese restaurants, which is tasty but nothing special. But then we heard of the amazing array of meatless Chinese cuisine at Ma Ma Wok and had to try! We absolutely loved it!! First off, the staff was all very friendly which is big in my book. Then we had delicious lettuce wraps with vegetarian ham. We then had two vegan chicken entrees. They really tasted like chicken and the sauces had wonderful flavor. 

Please keep an open mind. This food is very delicious and I used to eat meat. Animal products do not need to be part of your meal. If you read about the treatment of innocent animals on factory farms, the environmental impact of meat and dairy consumption (global warming) and all the hormones and junk that goes into most animal products, you can then see that eating a more plant based diet is the way of the future."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this as it was my first time trying vegan Chinese and I could order anything on the menu, which never happens. But I was disappointed. I ordered the sesame chicken, which was okay, but kind of crunchy like real Chinese food. Which is something I always hated. My omni husband got the sweet and spicy chicken and veggies. There was barely any chicken and he didn't like it very much. He's very open minded and likes almost every fake meat he's tried. The owners were very nice and accommodating and made him a side order of sweet and sour chicken and it was disgusting. Sorry :( I feel bad because they were so nice. But we both tried it and spit it out. It was mushy. The spring rolls were good. I would probably go back and give it another chance. My meal was okay, and the owners were very sweet but over all I was disappointed. I still support them and appreciate their business."}
{"text":"Called here to place an order for pickup, because lotus cafe was closed. The lady was extremely rude, inattentive and impatient. Not to mention the fact that she was coughing up a lung in my ear - every other word. She talked over me as I tried to tell her about my allergy and seemed to be in a rush. I cancelled my order due to the horrible service. Can't review the food so 2 stars for the one star service. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's refreshing to find Vegan Chinese food and close to home. This place is super yummy, there are a lot of angry past customers who miss their fried wings and other non Vegan dishes that were sold prior to the restaurants conversion to fully Vegan menu so the reviews will vary until the TRUE Vegan fan base learn about this place as angry birds will have not nice things to say. 
Our toddler has never been a big meat eater he is always forced to try meat by my husband. I just have always made high Protein non meat items for him and I as prior to my Vegan conversion I was a Pescatarian 2 Days a week and a Vegetarian 5 Days a week for 10 years so I understood his no desire for meat as I didn't eat much pregnant with him (only occasional seafood). 
Our son really enjoyed the Vegetarian Fried Rice which he shared with my husband both visits we've made here. He also enjoys the appetizer Lemon Fish cakes which are yummy. My husband and I always get the Spring roll appetizer as well to share. I've had the asparagus chicken which was super yummy and just recently on our latest visit I tried asparagus fish and wasn't disappointed at all. It had be same yummy light taste and flavorful which is much appreciate as people think Vegan food lacks flavor but it DOESN'T. Ooh let's not forget the Mushroom Dim Sum Vegan soup the owner gave me as she LOVES that my son LOVES Vegan food and that I'm nourishing a PlantBased baby in my tummy so she always looking out for me."}
{"text":"Love this place and AMAZING FOOD! So awesome that vegan options are marked on their menu. So proud of this place for being the first vegetarian Asian food in this area."}
{"text":"My go-to place when I'm too lazy to cook.  Family favorite is the Singapore Mei Fun.  With the lack of authentic Asian restaurants in CLT- the Singapore Mei Fun is the closest authentic dish I'm going to get until my next trip home.  I do not recommend the crab wontons, its usually a hit or miss.  Chicken in broccoli in white sauce is another dish I order when the family is not in the mood for noodles."}
{"text":"Yesterday night I got the sesame chikn all day combo and the flavors,textures and sight of it all brought me back sweet memories. The food was very delicious and tasty!  I also got the \"shrimp\" fried rice and BBQ veg meat and it was AMAZING as well! I will be back. I have been meat-free and Vegan since 2016 and I am impressed so far! Once you go Vegan you will not miss out on anything!"}
{"text":"First let me qualify that I wish there was a 3.5 star option.  Also despite the criticism of this review- I will still support this establishment for their amazing vision!  Having said that, I do wish this place was more consistent.  Whether you order the Kung Pao Chkn from the regular menu (10.99) or the all day combo menu (7.99) you disappointingly get the exact same amount.  I was excited for the drumsticks but this week they were over cooked and greasesticks.  Veggies always taste fresh and your food isnt drowned in cornstarch filled sauces- but I just find the value for the prices are very inconsistent.  It cost me over 22 bucks for a combo and drumsticks-  Perhaps offer more options for customers that may want to try an app without paying a price that is significantly higher than main courses."}
{"text":"My husband and I are vegan and we miss some dining out on the weekends. We finally tried Ma Ma Wok yesterday and it is sooooooo good. Even a non-vegan would like it. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, my husband had the chicken Lo Main and we had some potstickers and spring rolls. Everything was delicious. One thing that I really liked is that the food was not too salty which can be the case in a lot of Chinese restaurants but it had a lot of flavor. We will definitely come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Four stars because they are a good and consistent execution of exactly what they are...an Americanized Chinese takeout place. Plus they deliver, and quickly. This is the kind of place where you'll find sticky bright red sweet and sour sauce and greasy fat lo mein noodles. That's ok, eat it and enjoy it for what it is."}
{"text":"So the customer service is excellent they seem really sweet and attentive to my vegan needs lol which is awesome"}
{"text":"Good place for take out.  They are consistent and fast. Everyone is nice and the delivery guys are very nice as well.  I agree with Stephanie C. in that they will modify anything - which is a big plus! 

I especially like their Singapore Mei Fun and if I have a hankering for fried food, I order the Sesame Chicken."}
{"text":"First time here ! Ordered orange chicken with fried rice, an egg roll & a diet coke. (See pic) it was VERY good . Orange chicken was sweet & crispy loved it ! It had pieces of orange peel in it .. fried rice was good . i paid $10 for everything ! Will be back"}
{"text":"Fully vegan Chinese restaurant in Ballantyne area! I usually get general tso chkn with fried rice or lo mein & their spring rolls are amazing too. 

Dine in or carryout with super friendly staff.... you must try them out."}
{"text":"My All Time Favorite Spot In Charlotte. 


For many reasons..

1. 100% Vegan = No guilty food coma afterwards 
2. Portion size is literally perfect
3. Quality food!(The rice was so great along with the sauce for the sesame chicken. Also IT TASTES JUST LIKE CHICKEN)
4. Great service everytime I go
5. They're the ONLY vegan Chinese spot in Charlotte 

You need to try this place out because it's so unique. Where else you gonna get sesame chicken and rice without feeling like trash after?? Delicious."}
{"text":"This is clearly a take out establishment. Interior is lacking anything great, including a dated fountain machine. However, the food is good Americanized  versions of Chinese food. Like the open kitchen so after eating in I can see what's up. Kung Pao was perfect on spice but a little suacy. Fried rice on point. I'd do it agian but get it delivered...too bad I'm in uptown which is too far."}
{"text":"After coming across glowing reviews of this place in a FB group I finally met up with a friend of mine who is a carnivore for some lunch. Not only was the plate of food beautiful and delicious, but the owners are some of the nicest people we have ever met. They came over and talked to us about their food and prep as well as they offered to make us delicious fresh juice and that was also amazing. The spring rolls were rolled and cooled while we were there and for my friend who eats meat, he said he could easily give it up if everything was this delicious. Can't wait to take my wife this week. 40 mins away from my house and I will become a frequent patron."}
{"text":"I live nearby and have eaten here with mixed results. Quite frankly there are just too many better alternatives nearby to settle for average (at best). There is also a communication barrier to deal with and I'm not real comfortable with their sanitary rating. 

Try somewhere else. Pineville is worth the 8 minute drive. You have four legitimate alternatives there!"}
{"text":"Best fake meat dishes!  Excellent food. Good price.  We will be back. Great to find a good vegan restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time by placing an order for delivery. The food hadn't shown up after an hour so we called back to find out about it and the lady apologized and said it was on its way. After two hours the food still hadn't arrived. Not sure if the food is any good or not but the delivery isn't."}
{"text":"Wow I was extremely impressed with the food here. It is absolutely delicious, reasonably priced, fast and the service is great. Definitely worth the drive to come out here. The menu had tons of options it was mind blowing!"}
{"text":"Finally ate here and it was delicious!!! I'm vegan my boyfriend eats meat, I had the General Tso's and he had the Lo Mein. My fake meat was great and was so satisfying his Lo Mein had some awesome tasting fake chicken. I highly recommend it here, especially for vegetarians/vegans. Wish it were closer to charlotte, I'd go all the time, they were super nice and it was clean too. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"AWESOME!! good crunchy egg rolls good potions at lunch.right around the corner from my job and was quick. Today was my first time there let's hope next time is just as good!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch takeout and ordered spicy shredded beef, bean curd with vegetables, fried dumplings and hot and sour soup. The shredded beef was large chunks of beef, and had a lot of onions. It tasted like beef with onions. The bean curd was fried too long. The fried dumpling didn't have any taste,and same goes for the hot and sour soup. I had to throw away most of the food. When I sat down for my order I noticed several worn shoes on the floor visible from dining room. I would not go back again."}
{"text":"I will start by saying the food is amazing. best Chinese food in the area. I have been ordering from them for about 3 years now. It has always taken a bit of time for me to get my food, but I always assumed it was because im in South Charlotte (15 minutes from Ballentyne). Tonight was my worst experience yet, and despite the fact their food is seriously craveable, they lost a costumer. I ordered my food at 6:20 this evening. The customer service on the phone or lack there of was as always very rude.  about an hour after I ordered ( the usual wait time) I got a phone call from a very nice and polite driver. He told me he was lost and would be there as soon as possible. completely understandable... who doesn't get lost in Charlotte? about 30 minutes after his call I called the store back to see where he might be. the unfriendly \"person in charge\" informed me my driver had left only minutes ago. she also said it was a busy night and to be patient. as if that wasn't rude enough coming from some one in the hospitality business she then hangs up on me. 15 minutes later my food arrives. The Delivery boy proceeds to apologize and blah blah at this point I just want my food. or do I? was it made 2 hours ago, or 30 minutes? who knows. I will no longer suggest Ma Ma Woks to my friends. good food. horrendous service. I would rather eat mediocre Chinese food made from someone who is at least going to be nice to me for paying for their service."}
{"text":"Excellent! Finally a vegan/vegetarian Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. Thank you for choosing to make a difference."}
{"text":"TL;DR: all-vegan, tasty food with fresh and crisp veggies, and kind, helpful owners. Choose tofu if faux meats are not your thing, and keep in mind that sodas come in plastic bottles and their takeaway containers are Styrofoam. Sugg: order the dumplings!

Vegan here, I would absolutely come again. Visited for a weeknight dinner with my omnivorous SO, who loved each dish just as much as I did (he's familiar with faux meats from my cooking, so no surprises there).

App: The dumplings are very tasty, clearly handmade. 

Entrée: We ordered the \"chicken\" curry by staff recommendation, which had many lovely veggies, some fried tofu, and some faux \"chicken\" slices. My SO ordered the kung pao \"beef\", which had a lot of broccoli and some peanuts. The faux \"beef\" had a bit of an anise hint to it, which isn't my favorite, but it grew on me the more I ate it. Both of these entrees came with rice. If you're concerned about eating faux meats, you can't go wrong with old-school fried tofu. 

Dessert: We couldn't resist an order of the freshly fried Chinese donuts, which were nicely crisped on the outside and so soft and fluffy on the inside. It's a big order though, and hard for 2 people to finish after all the other food we ordered. I ate the rest at home with jam, but they do lose their crispness if you eat them later, FYI."}
{"text":"My husband and I are trying to eat more meat free meals and decided to try this place.  It did not disappoint!  The food was delicious and fresh and I could not tell the beef and broccoli was vegetarian at all.  The steamed dumplings and lo mein were also delicious.  Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots. Always nice to have different options for food plus great service.  Just imagine all of your favorite Chinese entrees made with meat.. Must try this place if you live any where near here."}
{"text":"Mama Wok recently went vegetarian - they have a ton of great options. The Hunan \"Chicken\" was absolutely delicious. The pan fried dumplings added a nice touch! The service was outstanding. Will be back! Amazing food!!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving MaMa Wok 3 stars out of 5 because we have been big fans of theirs in the past, but since they have gone totally vegan I am not as big a fan any more.  I will continue to try out their dishes to find some that I like though.  Last night we ordered egg drop soup - good; won ton soup - HUGE disappointment!; spring roll - tasteless; \"veggie chicken\" lo mein - delicious; fried rice - tasteless.  Maybe some of their other dishes will be tastier but without the meat, it is just not the same.  I will say that it did not fill me up as much as usual and I felt like I was eating cleaner, but definitely not as tasty as in the past."}
{"text":"I've ordered food from the restaurant just one time.  This was the typical Chinese restaurant with 'not bad' food.  We ordered the Kung-Pao chicken (Yes, if you've read my other Chinese restaurant reviews, Kung Pao chicken is clearly my benchmark of quality) with steamed rice and a spring roll.

They prepare their meal in a relatively light sauce, somewhat runny.  It contained the typical vegetables and wasn't anything to shout about.  We did ask for it extra-hot; however, it was nothing more than spicy BBQ potato chips --and nowhere near Andy Capps hot fries.

The restaurant inside was pretty clean, and they were very efficient at making the food in the typical 5 minutes.

If I eat here again, it will only be because the Lotus Cafe down the street is closed due some freak event."}
{"text":"It's vegetarian food. I really want to try vegetarian food after eating too much meat during the weekdays. It's good choice for weekend for me."}
{"text":"I've been a Ma Ma Wok loyalist for 6+ years now, and they've only gotten better with time. I could wax poetic about this place forever. Great people, fantastic service, locally owned and AWESOME food! My husband and I love the broccoli and tofu, and the sesame \"chicken\" is to die for. Their portions are always generous and reasonably priced. Now I've just to figure out how to get them to open a location closer to uptown Charlotte..."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The food is always fresh and not as greasy as other Chinese restaurants. The owner is always available to answer any questions about the vegan menu.

My one issue is that most items are a mock meat. As a strict vegetarian, I'm not trying to replicate a meat taste. This is true for most Indians who are vegetarian. There aren't any descriptions of what these mock meats are (i.e. tofu, seitan, wheat gluten) so I don't venture out from just getting a basic tofu dish. If they just added a sheet to the menu with descriptions of the \"meats\" that would be very helpful and get me more comfortable with trying more items from the extensive menu."}
{"text":"My first time here was yesterday and I fell in LOVE With the place. The two ladies were wonderful that worked there. It's hard to find vegan items on a menu but their entire menu is vegan and everything was phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for your Chinese American takeout/restaurant, this is the place. Not fancy, just good food, and it's vegan! The prices are super reasonable, and the staff is kind and humble. Skip the meat tonight, and treat yourself."}
{"text":"We arrived ten minutes before closing and we were only able to get take out.  So, we got fast take out.   Had to make a quick decision, so we both got tofu dishes. We were drawn here based on my reading a Yelp review that told of it being vegan and vegetarian.  Their menu includes sesame chicken, but all meat is vegetarian.   There were a lot of vegan and vegetarian offerings on the menu.  Seemed entirely authentic as two Chinese women helped us at the counter and their English was difficult to understand.   For a minute, I thought I was in China.   Eating Chinese food at home at 10:00 pm was certainly out of the box for us.  The food ended up being just so so. There was a lot of grease. Perhaps we are so used to Thai and Vietnamese food now and this just seemed not as healthful.    I will give them the benefit of doubt since we poked our heads in the door just before closing.  It probably was not their best culinary performance."}
{"text":"Ma Ma Wok used to be a Chinese American fast food place. Since it went vegetarian, the food has been great! The dishes are freshly made with a variety of great tastes. They are actually better than many vegetarian dishes we had in China!  We are actually meat lovers.  We have eaten here twice since it became a vegetarian restaurant and will come back more trying out new dishes."}
{"text":"We love this place. My wife and I are vegan and it is some awesome food. I took my parents out one day and they are definitely not vegan but they couldn't tell that it was a vegan restaurant. I try to make it up as much as I can but it is quite a drive currently. I understand they were not a previous vegan restaurant but they converted and I am glad they did."}
{"text":"So happy there is a vegan/vegetarian Chinese restaurant now! I got referred by a co worker and told my boyfriend about it. He went the day before me and had TWO plates by himself (that's how good it was) cashew chicken and general chicken. He said both were very good.  so me and my dad came to try. 

We both got the sesame veg chicken combo with rice and spring roll. It was so good! I haven't had real chicken in forever, and it was awesome to get something other than veggies at a Chinese restaurant that was actually DELICIOUS! We will definitely be back. Best vegan Chinese food for a great price!"}
{"text":"Great food! Had been disappointed with my old place so decided to give Ma Ma Wok a try. Food was great, staff was friendly and prices were very reasonable. And delivery was a big bonus. Will definetly be ordering again!"}
{"text":"We heard that they recently went completely vegetarian and had to go and check it out.  They have tons of vegan options!  We ordered the Peking duck, the fish in tomato and mushroom sauce, and the kung pao chicken.  We also had an order of potstickers.  Everything tastes very fresh and delicious!  I think the crowd favorite was the Peking duck.  Everything was reasonably priced, we didn't have to wait long, and the people working there were very friendly.  If I lived in Charlotte, I would be there all the time!"}
{"text":"Incredibly good, real tasting food. Would definitely recommend sweet and sour soup and General Tso's. The rice was not greasy paper rolls were crispy and flakey. My wife ordered orange chicken and you could actually taste the orange and it's zest in the sauce. They obviously care about their food and it shows. Definitely check these guys out because I left feeling full and healthy"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! Haven't had fried rice that good in years! Really worth the drive if you're not on that side of town."}
{"text":"This was so good!!! Since I started veganism I've missed Asian takeout food so much, my friend and I tried this place and we were so surprised!! I had general tsos \"chicken\" with friend rice and an eggroll all for $8!! And it tasted like real chicken! It was so good and we are definitely going again!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Tasted Chinese and didn't miss the meat. Although small and in a strip mall, obviously this is an authentic Chinese restaurant. The waitress and owner were very attentive and helpful to make sure we had a good experience. We particularly enjoyed the Thai Chai cold drink and sweet and sour veg dish."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Crazy how the fake meat has so much favor and texture! Anybody would be amazed by this place."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! I love this place! So happy to have another ALL VEGAN restaurant!! The staff is so nice & the food came quickly. I had the Hot & Sour Soup to start and it was great...plenty of veggies and some freshly snipped cilantro--delicious! My spring roll was good, too. My family got the \"chicken\" drumsticks--very authentic!! And tasty! The Seitan \"chicken\" was very good and I like their rice.  My daughter enjoyed her vegetable fried rice and my parents got what they always order: a rice noodle dish that has vegetables and 3 \"meats\"--shrimp, beef and I forgot the last. It's so much that they always share. Ma Ma Wok rocks!! 
(My only complaint: it was very warm eating in the restaurant...but it was in the high 90s that day...)"}
{"text":"Ma Ma Wok re-opened as a vegetarian Asian restaurant on Aug 1, 2017. I just discovered them and ate there for lunch today. Everything they serve is vegetarian and most menu items are vegan. I had the beef & broccoli and it was fantastic. The broccoli was not overcooked; it had a crunch that made me happy. The beef was very realistic. In fact, I pondered if it was real meat and reminded myself that it is an entirely vegetarian restaurant. The sauce was a bit sweet, but that's normal these days. I got the fried rice, which had a slightly smoky flavor. Overall, it was a great tasting meal. 

The prices are definitely higher than a normal Chinese restaurant, but they are in line with other vegetarian restaurants such as Bean. One advantage of this restaurant over a normal Chinese restaurant is not having to worry about your food cooking on the same griddle as meat and not having chicken wings fried in the same oil as your spring roll. The waitresses were all super nice and the place was very clean. 

I'm very happy to have another vegetarian restaurant in Charlotte and looking forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"Great food, big portions, fast delivery. When i think Chinese food I think MA MA Wok"}
{"text":"Not gourmet but solid every time. The folks are always very nice and the good is delicious."}
{"text":"4/23/18 ~We have been trying out different things consistently here , and as such the only qualms I have besides not being organic for the prices, are portion sizes!~ We used to believe REDBOWL was pricey but you always always received a great portion for each dish- although the \"faux chicken/meat\" with asparagus here is one of the more expensive dishes,imho,  it gives you like very little  of any of the faux anything ...mostly vegetables for not a faux price!  Also, we enjoy the spring rolls but they are way overpriced too for their diminutive size. Being a business man myself I always prefer feeling like my meal was worth it when we eat out vegan or not!


We have had take out here twice recently ...
~ Food is very good. Tasty and flavorful.
~ portion sizes are average.
~ Vegan quality is good, and fresh!
~  interior is a typical basic Chinese restaurant.
~No eggs dairy, msg or oversalty.
-  staff is friendly.

~ Business practices- hmmm - On this last take-out order of $60, we ordered \"brown rice\" with everything only to arrive 30 mins later to pick up , and find out that they didn't have any brown rice for ALL 4 of our entrees ...only whita rice! No phone call or warning or courtesy-

So you be the judge?! I will Update in the near future based on more experiences."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the new menu. Chicken is beat down to flat patty's. Not enough food for the price. Flavoring not good. Miss the Egg drop soup. We were loyal customers but are sad to say good bye."}
{"text":"Thanks for overcharging me for nothing. Seriously?!

For starters I ordered the \"Crab Rangoon.\" As you probably know they are fried won tons stuffed with cream cheese and crab.... They had little to NO filling! Wtf?! (see picture)

My \"Sweet & Sour Chicken was burnt and hard. (see picture)

I ordered extra sauce for \"The 4 Seasons\" entrée, I was charged but did not receive hardly any sauce at all. (see picture)

This place is terrible. I have low standards for Chinese restaurants, but this place is awful."}
{"text":"Ma Ma Wok is the best \"fast-food\" Chinese place on the Southside. Always well-cooked delicious meals, timely and friendly service. A+"}
{"text":"Aww, I was really hoping to like this place. Even if I hadn't the read the promising reviews prior to eating here, I expected better. As a a pesca-vegan, I wanted to surprise my mom by not telling her the meat was fake. But this inedible concoction was not the kind of surprise I intended. 

Sorry, mom. 

Perhaps we shouldn't have arrived 15 minutes before lunch closing.

At the very least, the food should match the menu description. Their sweet n' sour \"chicken\" contained potato instead of pineapple (as listed). Whyyy. My dish contained a minuscule amount of UFOs (Unidentified Food Objects), making this a particularly tragic substitution choice. 

My mother's cashew \"chicken\", on the other hand, was worse--and didn't even have cashews. The scarce amount of chicken she did have looked like shaved tofu, opposed to more normalized bits of chicken or even fake meat, which I can attest to in Los Angeles. 75% of her order was vegetables, unlike mine, which she describes as \"a cross between sinewy muscle and tree branches.\"

Ma Ma Wok gives plant-based a whole new meaning. Ma ma, run."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant!  We ordered the fried wonton, potstickers, General Tso Chicken, noodles with chicken and the donuts, and everything was delicious!  Will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Incredible! Wonderful! I am so happy right now! This is my first visit to MaMaWok. I can only give stellar reviews on several points.

The hot and sour soup is delicious. It's always been a favorite soup for me, but have not had it since living in Charlotte,  because I eat a plant based diet. I'm so happy to have that flavor back!

The Peking Duck (I asked for their vegan version) is automatically one of my favorite things.

The people are beautifully kind. I really feel like a guest, not a customer. 

Clean! I'm here late, near closing, and they are cleaning in places I know most restaurants don't. They are moving things and getting behind things. I just watched a man clean the door knobs to the rest room. Very impressed.

Whether you eat a plant based/cruelty free diet, or not, this is a \"must try\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Always good. I am generally not a Chinese food fan but I found this place maybe a year ago and ever since I eat it regularly. I especially love the egg drop soup. We usually take it to go. Definitely great for a casual night in!"}
{"text":"Ignore the butt-hurt morons who give 1-star reviews because they're so lazy they can't go another .5 miles to go gnaw on flesh at any other Chinese restaurant. 

The wheat gluten used for the Tso's and Orange \"meats\" is excellent. The lemon \"fish\" appetizer surpasses any mock fish I've seen. Additionally, the \"cutlass\" appetizer mocked a fried chicken texture. I will be back to try the rest of the menu, but am pleased a place like this now exists in South Charlotte....or in Charlotte in general. If you've been to Harmony in Atlanta, it is very similar."}
{"text":"Yes Yes Yes! This place is amazing! The staff is even better. Very friendly people. I will be back. 45 minuet drive. Still worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent vegan options and superb service!  Definitely worth a trip here, even if it is out of the way.
We had the spring rolls, string bean appetizer, orange peel veg meat, and a special noodle soup made with ginger and tomato."}
{"text":"I made the trek out to Ma Ma Wok from Huntersville because I kept hearing how good the food was! And it definitely didn't disappoint! They now serve vegetarian/vegan food but honestly my carnivore husband was very pleased. The orange veg. chicken was amazing, as was the lemon fish appetizer. Definitely try the spring rolls, they are crispy and delicious! Also the owners are really friendly and answer all your questions. Can't wait for my next excuse to go!"}
{"text":"A great friend has been telling me about this place but I finally got to try it AND wow this is a vegetarians paradise! This is right up there with an vegetarian Indian buffet which of course the best part is you don't have to worry about what is in anything. 

I announced to my entire party that I would be trying all of their food which I totally did! We started of with with sticky buns which had their \"ham\" in it. They were a great place to start.

{"text":"This place is amazing! We had the vegetable and the \"pork\" steamed buns, loved the veggie most. The Lemon Veg Fish appetizer was so flaky and delicious - I've had real fish that didn't even compare. Their rice dishes are great. Took home some Chinese donuts - super addictive and made fresh. The service was wonderful as well. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"The same better food and now they go green and meatless chicken shrimp etc... I still love the quality here instead all chineses restaurant around"}
{"text":"This restaurant recently went 100% vegetarian. I've been waiting for a veggie Chinese restaurant in Charlotte for years and am so happy to finally have a good one. I had the wonton soup and kung pao chicken. It was heaven! I can't wait to go back. My only regret is that I ate my meal so fast I forgot to take pictures. The fake meat is so good I think the meat eaters will love it too. The owners are vegetarians and know what they are doing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love this place! Amazing vegetarian Chinese food! Good service. However, ordering from the website can be tricky since the (781) number isn't the actual number to the restaurant. They really need to fix that. Other than that, the spicy orange \"chicken\" is incredible! One of my favorite \"pop in\" spots in Ballantyne! They should also add delivery :-)"}
{"text":"Holy Hidden Gem!  This place is a bit off the beaten path, but really holds its own since not many places can claim they are entirely vegetarian.    Super un-assuming... and easy to miss... 

Small dining area.. probably five booths around the perimeter and then tables in the center of the restaurant.  The service was excellent and very polite... we didn't have a dedicated server (my guess here is it is \"all hands on deck\" 24/7 so everyone gets taken care of).  

I was super blown away at the menu (with pictures).  It was super helpful especially since the menu still listed \"chicken, beef, pork, etc\"  but its not... it was almost like a magic show with food!  Probably my favorite part is that each table had a hand-drawn \"recommendations\" card... of which I took each of those recommendations to heart.

Ordered the fried wantons (based off the hand drawn placard) and the General Tso Tofu... came with your choice of rice.  OMG super tasty and delicious... I had a friend that ordered the BBQ Pork Buns and the Zhajiangmian noodle.  I'll let the photos speak for itself.

I'm a little bummed.. I want to keep this place a secret from the masses, but really everyone should come down here and try what Ma Ma Wok is doing.

There is also a doughnut place next door, so this shopping center has become very dangerous to me."}
{"text":"I've become a regular here because of how great it is. The service, food, and price are all worth 5 stars! The people who own and run this place are all so wonderful, and constantly smiling and being willing to accommodate their guests(take out and dine in) which feels so welcoming. Their food is stellar & I am LOVING having a full vegan menu here. The prices are on point as well & I feel like it is consistent each time. Thank you ma ma wok !!"}
