{"text":"Tried this taqueria on the recommendation of my friend from Mexico D.F. I was not disappointed. Very good tacos al pastor. Be warned it is cash only do make sure you stop at an ATM."}
{"text":"It's so hard to find a REAL Mexican taco place that the tacos are to die for! And this spot REALLY made worth our drive from Peoria!  Btw they ONLY TAKE CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Estos si son tacos mis respetos!! Lugar es my comodo y limpio y El precio es rasonable visitenlos....."}
{"text":"FYI...they have moved to 5060 W Bethany Home. This place is amazing! I love their tacos, especially their Al Pastor. Their Alambre is also super good! Not the best area in Phoenix and service can be kinda sucky at times but don't let that stop you from trying this place if you're looking for authentic street tacos."}
{"text":"Just passing through and stopped to eat.  The menu board was in Spanish and apparently the cashier did not speak English.  As soon as she saw us, she went to the kitchen and a young man came and waited on us.  He explained the menu and gave us the ingredients they contained.  The food was very good and portions were large.  Excellent value for the money!  Although the area looked sketchy we felt completely safe and enjoyed our stop.  Don't hesitate to visit this business."}
{"text":"No se dejen llevar con la finta del trompo. Los tacos estan mas recalentados que nis mis zobacos. Y grasientos. Bueno y la igiene del lugar no muy recomendable. Moscas por donde quiera. Y aparte no les sirve el aire y hace un caloron."}
{"text":"The food was great and affordable. Give this place a try and you won't be disappointed. The Al Pastor meat had a lot of flavor. Will be returning for another meal."}
{"text":"Yes this area is sketchy. But if you know anything about authentic Mexican food is that its on the hood not in the upscale areas.... As i walked into this place i remembered those restaurants in Mexico that j visited as a kid. The ladies cooking are those humble looking tias(aunts) that have cook d since they were little girls. The pastor is sizzling outside on that standing \"trompo\" rotating slowly and tempting you as you walk by. The restaurant is small and has old Quiznos seats and tables but who cares!! The food is what you come here for. The tacos are $1.75 but worth it. Burritos are $6. And quesadillas or tortas are $6 if i remember right. Theres 4 different meats. I had carne asada and pastor. Asada i could skip but al pastor was the best i've had in Arizona. Nothing has came close to the authentic al pastor taste as these tacos. They serve them with grilled onions, chile toreado(grilled jalapeño) and nopales(grilled cactus). Those little sides just add more authenticity and deliciousness. The salsas are in little Daisy cups, the only con to this place as i prefer the salsa bars. They have all your mexican sodas and more. They will have all the boxes of sodas and onions surrounding the dining area(this is what reminds me of the D.F humble restaurants, theres no place to store them so they store them wherever they can). Try this place you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I drive pass this place almost every single day , always see it full & finally decided to pull over to give it a try . A small hole in the wall restaurant, has one of the best tacos I've ever had in my life , keep in mind I'm a huge taco enthusiast , this location is moving to a small strip mall on Bethany home road & grand & extremely excited to see how the new location will look inside . The menu was written on poster board , but none the less simple & clear . I had my self two tacos de pastor al trompo, and two de longaniza, (tacos come in pairs) , I got my daughter two chicken tacos , and my boyfriend got a burrito de pastor. Tacos came garnished with cilantro, onion , and grilled onions & sliced chile toreados, with an slice of lime & an excellent green tomatillo salsa. Also the pastor tacos came garnishes with a few slivers or pineapple, the way real al pastor should be served . I'll definitely be back for more !"}
{"text":"Seriously the best tacos in Phoenix! Tacos del trompo. Pastor, my fave! Cash only. Best street tacos. We eat here at least once a week. I have also tried their tortas, and frijoles charros  yum. Hidden gem."}
{"text":"The area is sketchy, the place is quite humble (also, as stated by others, their location is now on Bethany Home Rd.), they only take cash, their menu is very simple with few options. Still, I'd drive back there because their tacos al pastor are the best I've had so far in Phoenix, served with pineapple and everything."}
{"text":"Hands down, best street tacos in ARIZONA!  The service on the other hand isn't all that great. The lady that rings you up literally looks like she's having a bad day everyday. (Been here plenty of times and not once has she been pleasant). Cash only which is another bummer.   Los mejores tacos en Arizona pero que mal servicio al cliente! La señora que cobra tiene in genio de poca....todas las veces que emos comido aqui nunca a sido agradable."}
{"text":"Food is delicious especially tacos al pastor just the lady is super rude!!! Honestly is ahe wasnt there I would go more often.  I wish she would just smile or something and she gers mad at you for no reason!"}
{"text":"They get 3 stars because their food is very good; I wish I could give them (0) zero for not having an established schedule, it's basically \"come eat if you get lucky\". Today I called and said they would be open at 3:30p, and they said literally \"we have no schedule\". Well, that sucks!!! Maybe what people can do is call them and ask them to set up a darn schedule!!! Lastly, I will review the way they served the salsa last time: They gave me a lot of it in a little bowl, then they took back what was left, I'd say enough for two people...I wonder if they re-used it, that would be gross, but that's just a thought, and I have no proof of unhealthy practices."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. I had the Al Pastor for the first time this weekend and it did not disappoint! The grilled onion, cactus and jalapeno combo inside my burrito yes please! with beans and cheese! Very tasty not spicy! $6.00 and it was 2 meals for me, these burros are big!  I'm a huge fan of their Carne Asada as well.   I am sad to report that they are moving from 43rd ave and Camelback to 50th ave and Bethany Home. 5060  W Bethany Home Ste#1 Glendale, AZ 85301 to be exact. Still not far from my house though! I will continue to get their bangin Burritos!   ******Important info****** They are a CASH ONLY establishment! They are mostly Spanish speaking employees there have been times I have been there and no one speaks English. So be prepared to order in Spanish.  So in short brush up on your Española, put 10 bucks in your pocket and go get a great meal!"}
{"text":"I love that they don't put repollo on the tacos. Since I've been out here everywhere I go repollo on the tacos instead of cilantro WTF .It's a Arizona thing I gues. The tacos de chorizo are great. The tacos de pastor are really good I like how they actually have the trompo cooking there.  They need a spicier sauce to go with the tacos."}
{"text":"First off, this is in a sketchy area but don't let that scare you away from having awesome food!  Went there and had the best al pastor tacos I've ever had. They serve them with a side of Nopales (cactus) which is kind of unusual but I guess that's how they do it here. These guys are from d.f. (districto federal) if you don't know, that is Mexico city, so these guys are the real deal. They serve the tacos with pineapple and grilled onions and a grilled jalapeno. I haven't tried anything else on the menu but from what other reviews say the food is bomb. (That means good!) you need to come here and try them you won't be disappointed! Oh, they only take cash so be prepared! There was an English speaker there when I went but another review said there wasn't one there, (no matter to me I speak both) but still, do not let this scare you away! Oh and their sign reads: Tacos del trompo.."}
{"text":"Tacos are delicious, but when you ask for extra salsa or lemons they like to deny you extras. Not the best service in that sense."}
{"text":"No stars called 3 times to try and get directions lady was super rude and keep hanging up on us Change your address lady it's wrong on Yelp"}
{"text":"We stopped in to try them out, wanted one of everything so we could decide what to take home for everyone else. Alas, lady @register chose this night to decide her prices were going to be $2 per taco/minimum 2 tacos per order (different from menu). Nearby customer overhearing offered to assist in translation, but became *very uneasy* when she continued to demand $4 per order despite menu. Suspected lady was trying to take advantage as well, so we walked out. Heads up."}
{"text":"This food was pretty nasty, nobody here could eat it, we had to take it back.  I won't be going back to this place ever."}
{"text":"Delish tacos and the like - great service. I could eat there again and again. Lunch is a truly yum experience. Jump right in!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for tacos right off the trompo this place isn't it. When I went there, there was a picture of it but that's it. The meat is not prepared fresh off it if it even is cooked on it to begin with.   The meat was really dry on both the asada and al pastor from what I assume was reheating. Salsa was just okay. For 2 dollars a taco you could do better. Wanted to try it since it had made NewTimes list but I doubt they tried it. Not a fan, sucks because I tend to like mom and pop shops but they have some work to do. Went here with a group of 7 my friends daughter said \" at least the chocolate milk isn't dry\" lol."}
