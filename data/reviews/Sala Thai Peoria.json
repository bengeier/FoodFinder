{"text":"This is my favorite thai restaurant in the valley. Food is always great and the service is fantastic.  Great atmosphere and the employees are always friendly.  This is the second restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"The food here is so good and the service is exceptional! Pumpkin curry is delicious and all the fried rice are perfectly cooked. No greasy dishes! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to try this place since there aren't alot of thai places near me. Unfortunately i was extremely disappointed by the food. I ordered the yellow curry with chicken and shrimp fried rice. I didnt like the curry it was thinner and not as flavorful as im used to. However what was totally unacceptable and the reason for the one star rating was the rice. I ordered my food to go and while waiting in the restaurant i smelled something burning. When i got home and opened my fried rice i realized what it was. It wasn't just slightly burned. There were chunks of black burned rice inside so this was not a mere oversight. I think is unacceptable to serve burned food."}
{"text":"We had stir fry chow mein  two orders...red curry..and stir fry mix veggies with tofu. Chow mein was very good..that's why we ordered two of them..it was nice tossed and seasoned and not greasy. Red curry was great nice and spicy but you can get it mild as well...mix veggies with tofu was exactly hit the spot with all the veggies . Great neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Tried twice in the past two weeks, the first time was right after their lunch break.  With first experience the service was wonderful and the food was reasonable.  The boba tea however was very disappointing considering the price paid.  The second time the food and service was both horrendous.  No water refill and they forgot our rice and drink.  In the end we waited forever for our check, will not go back again."}
{"text":"Amazing!   Love this place!   Had the Panko Fried catfish... It was awesome.  Get both sauces cause you won't be able to decide which one is best!   Red Curry was bomb!!"}
{"text":"I just picked up my order everything was great!! I've been going to all tha Sala Thia restaurant from Avondale to Glendale and now I have one right by my house off tha 101 and Beardsley ! Me and my wife love Sala Thia there no Thia food better then this place ! You want great Thia food stop at Sala Thia"}
{"text":"My wife and I were pretty disappointed. The service was great and we got our food fast on a Friday night. We give 2 stars for the food. 
Order the Mas su man and the spicy ginger. It was obvious that ingredients had been cooked separate and then thrown together when served, meaning: the boiled vegetables were still crunchy and flavorless and both the beef and chicken were thin strips with no indication of having touched a grill, and the sauce's flavor was not apparent in vegetable, potato, or meat. Portion sizes were also much smaller compared to the large entrees normally served at Thai food restaurants. 

Helpful to note that the first review on this site (five stars) was written by our waitress."}
{"text":"My family and I have been keeping a close eye on this place ever since we saw a Thai restaurant was going into the complex. We ordered Pad Thai, cashew chicken, and crab wontons. We absolutely loved every item we ordered, and we will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Food was good, not the best but not the worst, however the service was terrible. Thirty minutes after ordering we were informed the kitchen lost our order and was going to be a little longer. During the meal the waiter was extremely inattentive and we waited again for a bit to get our check and take out. They did however take some items off the bill, I'm not going to write off this place forever but if the service is the same the next time I'll definitely not come back."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!
Great menu, good prices, fast and attentive service, and an all around easy to enjoy atmosphere. 
My husband and I were lucky enough to find this place, and during Happy Hour of all times. 
Singha, Egg Rolls, Red Curry, and my personal favorite Thai Fried Rice.  Spice levels go from 0-5. Not knowing how spicy it would be exactly, we ordered Curry=3 and the Rice=4. The fried rice was perfect, but next time we will order the curry at a 5 or 5+. The spice scale is very American palate not Thai palate, for a heads up. 
Lucky us, we had leftovers. Very pleased with our first visit to Sala Thai. Can't wait to try some of the entrees, like the Pumpkin Curry!"}
{"text":"I'm very familiar with Thai food, here and in Thailand. Something is going on here and I can't figure it out. Sometimes it's good and sometimes way way off. I see the same cooks there but the food can be iffy and I don't know why. The spice level, offered between 1 and 5, is way off.
Sometimes a 3 is just right for you, and the next time it's so hot you could never eat it no matter who you are or how spicy you like your food. The signature dish of many Thai restaurants, and certainly one that ALL Thai chefs have done over and over.... 
Pad Thai, was so bad, we couldn't even eat any of it. Not spicy, just bad. Not even close. Again, I still don't get it. The inconsistency keeps me away now. The soup was nice one day
and not even close a week later. Good luck with this one. Hope you hit it on a \"good day\"."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout and eaten here a few times and it's always great! My favorites are the papaya salad, pad Thai, and spicy green beans with chicken."}
{"text":"We had 4 appetizers and their pineapple fried rice. Wife loved the food, but I thought it was average."}
{"text":"Good food, great Tom yum soup.  They have beer now!!  Good service from our experiences so far."}
{"text":"Spicy beef salad (I do level 3)*****
Pad Thai (All the way level 5)*****
WOW!!

Beautiful. Great staff. Authentic. Check this place out."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place. It is very difficult to find good
Thai food in Phoenix. The wonton soup was superb, the yellow curry 
was delicious. The staff was very friendly and efficient. I definitely will be returning to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Worst Thai food !!! I'll never recommend this place to anyone 

Food was tasteless and flavorless....their 32nd street and cactus location is better !! Go there"}
{"text":"The chicken satay is very good, I've never seen my son devoured food like that before. I ate the yellow curry, the taste is very good, very flavorful. The people are nice and the price is reasonable. If you like asian food, you should give this place a  try."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in this side of town. The curry was delicious and the fried egg rolls were tasty too! Will definetly be coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food. Servers friendly, generous portions and great flavors and priced right!!!!! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"1st time i tried red curry, it was so salty. so i asked them to remake new one and the new one was fine.

2nd time i tried on 31-may-2017, when i entered the time was 8:45 pm and the server said \"Sir, only ToGo is available and no dine in becoz we are closing the restaurant in 15 mins\". All restaurants normally allow people to dine-in until closing time but this is the first restaurant i see this type of behavior. I was so hungry, so i ordered TOGO panang curry and i mentioned steam tofu should be small in size but they put big big steam tofu which is not cooked properly and too much of fish oil make my curry too smelly. I think chef made my dish in hurry, so it didn't came well. I don't try in this restaurant again."}
{"text":"First time trying this place I place a phone order was told the wait time was gonna be 30 mins. I showed up was not greeted, waited by the register for about 5 mins and being skipped then they realized I haven't been helped greeted me told me my order was not ready waited for another 30mins. horrible service but on the bright side the place was nice and the food was ok........ never coming here again"}
{"text":"Great food, but the waitress forgot to ask how hot we would like our order... Needs more spicey heat for us. We well be back;)"}
{"text":"So happy this opened up here. Food is consistently delicious. Highly recommend the Thai tea! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Had left a raving review in the past. Tonight has changed everything. Apparently, the kitchen was terribly confused and was making dishes out of order all night long. Two tables that were sat after us were as served before us. And an hour went by before I saw my food. This is so disappointing.  I ordered my dish medium spice and it came with no spice at all. Terrible."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for some time. I have only ordered take out. It only takes 10 mins for the food to be ready. It is always steaming hot when I get home. I love the chicken panang curry, it is amazing here. I have had panang all over town and this is one of the best I've had. I get it at a level 5 spice and it is perfect. I enjoy spicy food and they make it spicy but not overly hot. I order from Sala as often as I can. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant.  Start with spring rolls, have pad Ke mao with tofu ( drunken noodles ) or spicy basil leaves with beef.  Everything is great - never had a bad meal. Consistently good value pricing.

Continues top performance -dishes up Tasty and flavored fresh ingredients - there's a lot of good Thai food found in the Valley - this is the best *****

On their special board check out the basil seafood pumpkin - something....truly excellent sauce everything good, everything fresh.... make me want seconds, just like at home."}
{"text":"After living overseas and missing good Thai food I was surprised to find this little Hidden Gem."}
{"text":"We waited for what seemed like forever for them to open...we were excited to have a new restaurant in the area.... We finally were able to try it on Sunday (feb 28th) ...WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND $$$$.. the food was marginal and the service was horrible!!!! Our food and appetizers arrived at the same time and our fried rice shortly after that...we waited at least 30 minutes for the food and now one EVER  asked If we needed anything or how things were. The only time they were in a hurry to get to our table...was to clean it up!!!! There were take-out customers standing everywhere waiting for their food as well....I could go on and on but I've wasted enough time on this place.....Please don't waste yours!!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food and good service with a smile. But you cannot get any beer, wine, or booze. I hate going out to a really nice dinner at a place that does not have a liquor license."}
{"text":"2/22/16: Congratulations on Sala Thai's Grand Opening!!!!!!

5 stars for the nice decor
5 stars for the food (grilled salmon and chicken sate was delicious!)
5 stars for the great service 


Warm wishes and best of luck on all of Sala Thai's future endeavors!"}
{"text":"The food was perfect and the customer service was great!!! 
I recommend the Pumpkin Curry and the Pad-Se-Ew Noodles!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this new neighborhood restaurant on Saturday (Feb 27th).  Arrived at 6pm and they were fairly busy.  Got table fairly quick.  About 15 mins later water and napkins arrived, then we were able to order our appetizers (Thai veggie rolls and Chicken Satay).  Waitress came back about 15 mins later to take our dinner order.  10 mins later our veggie rolls arrived, but no chicken satay.  Chicken satay arrived about 5 mins later, partially warm and slightly dry.  So, we have been at the restaurant for approx 1 hour, appetizers gone and enjoying conversation.  Conversation continued until one of us realized that it was almost 730pm and no food yet.  Went to counter and asked about order.  Order had been forgotten.  Received food fairly quickly after that, but also received an unwanted extra order of thai veggie rolls which they tried to charge us for.  Also had a mysterious .25 cent charge on bill with no explanation.  Both corrected after discussion with manager.  May give another chance as this place is new and we should have expected issues this soon.  Hopefully they work out the glitches and improve service."}
{"text":"This new restaurant has great service and a clean kitchen.  It's a bit better than some of the Thai food restaurants around the area but not the best.  Foods are on the salty side.

Here are some of the stuffs that we tried so far:

Fried Rice - It's awesome when it's done right, but...they don't always do it right.  We ordered it several times and the quality is inconsistent.  I encourage everyone to order fried rice here so they can have more practice.

Tom-Yum Sea Food Soap - Sea food ingredients are fresh in general and the broth is more towards the real Thai style.  The soup is a bit too salty but I would definitely try it again on my \"don't need to be healthy\" day.

Sausages - There are two types; Thai sweet sausages and grill sausages.  Grill sausage is actually sour (and that's how it should be) so I don't recommend to those who are new to Thai food, they will just think it's spoiled meat.  Sweet sausages are okay, they are more like Chinese sausage."}
{"text":"They \"Grand Opened\" today and I went to get take out at about 6:15pm. 

I ordered Chicken Potstickers, Pad Thai, Yellow Curry, Garlic Chicken, and Grilled Beef...ordered everything \"low spice\". 

They had the order ready (and correct) in 15 minutes.  It's a welcome addition to this neighborhood. 

I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is really good. I eat here almost once a week. The crab won tons are the best and I have to get them every time."}
{"text":"Good Thai in northern Peoria. Definitely will be going back there soon. Their one issue is spice consistency. Even when ordering the same dish the same way; first time the food isn't spicy at all the next it's perfect, and the third time the food is really really hot. If they can get that on point this will be a 5 star restaurant. Love the Thai chicken nachos, veg spring rolls, fried egg rolls, green papaya salad, massaman curry, pad Thai, heck everything I've had there."}
{"text":"Hey hey my peeps \" I have never had Thai food before and it was fantastic.\" The chicken , lemon coconut milk soup  and spicy chicken and Thai noodles was busting with flavor !!! The price was ridiculously affordably and the service was very good . If you have never had it give it a chance it just might surprise you ! If you go let me know what you think . Emjoy"}
{"text":"I've been craving a good little Thai place in the northwest valley and I found it.  Starving, and trying to feed the cold that I had been battling, there was Sala Thai. I ordered the Drunken Noodles with chicken, level 3, and the Spicy Beef Fried Rice, 3.  Oh my gosh, they were both so so so delicious, full of fresh ingredients, a ton of veggies and the spicy level was perfect.  Everyone there is so pleasant and the place is very clean.  Definitely check this place and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We decided to try this local Thai place out after not being able to find a decent Thai place on the west side of Phoenix. This place is very good. We loved the spring rolls, the Thai fried rice with tofu and the crab wontons. Next time we will be more adventurous with our dishes. The service was very good and the restaurant is very clean. We will definitely be back to dine in or get take out."}
{"text":"Had the Chow Mein With Chicken and Tofu. the sauce is a light and flavorful. The egg noodles were a nice touch instead of the usual chow mein noodles. Plenty of veggies. Only $10 . Nice price and a good size portion. My wife had the Clear Noodle Soup with Tofu. Piping hot with  plenty of veggies. Nice local Thai joint. It will be on our  repertoire of Thai restaurants to go to."}
{"text":"When I walked in at noon on Wednesday 6/8 to place a to-go order and there wasn't a single customer seated, that should've been the clue to turn around and skeedaddle.  But I was really in the mood for Thai food and decided to give this place a shot - they had only been open four months.

The satay chicken skewer appetizer was tough and tasteless, devoid of any hint of marinade.  Even the peanut sauce couldn't save it.  The chicken potstickers were gummy and tasteless too.

I got Pad Thai for my girlfriend and she called it a \"gut-bomb.\"  The dish featured a big ball of paste-like noodles that stuck together so tightly you had to cut it with a sharp knife.  The were only 5-6 small pieces of chicken, very few green onions and sprouts, almost no crushed peanuts, no egg, and a few slivers of carrots.  Basically, no resemblance to any of the pad thai concoctions I've had over the years.

My Pa-Nang Curry was ordered extra spicy yet was as bland as applesauce.  The best part of the meal was the brown rice which I paid $2,00 extra for.

The bill came to $32 and some change and I felt really ripped off.  Just a real bad experience here.  No wonder not a single other customer visited the joint during the 15 minutes I waited for my to-go order smack dab in the middle of lunch hour."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch.  Place was empty except a couple coworkers talking about football.  Guy said sit anywhere.  As I sit I am listening to them continue to talk about football while I wait and wait.  I look around and there are several dirty tables even though there are no customers to be found.  

Guy finally comes over.  I put my order in.  Food comes out pretty quickly.  Tasted good.  Decent portion.  A little bit over priced but all things considered it was worth the money.  

Not sure I'd come back.  I would suggest the owner get a better staff, and have them greet and sit customers.  Make sure the tables get cleaned as soon as customers leave.  If they got time to sit and talk sports they have time to clean.  

Also I would create a specials menu to get some customers in the doors.

Best of luck."}
{"text":"Nice to see a Thai food place up this north. I had the Red Curry with chicken which was tasty but a bit watery. I like it on the thicker side. Thought it was a bit pricey for $10. They should come up with some lunch specials. I'd go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Big disappointment!!!!
We have been looking for a Thai restaurant in Peoria so we finally found this place went there last night excited to try. Before I start my review let me tell you I am Thai and used to have a Thai restaurant in Illinois. when we sat down ourselves and took at least five minutes before a waiter came asked if we wanted drinks so we ordered two beers 15 minutes gone by no beers,yet I decided to flag  down the waiter told him we still waiting for our beers then he came back told us they ran out  one of the beer we ordered,that's fine we got a soda instead.  We ordered crab wanton and papaya salad ( Thai hot ) took at least 15 minutes for appetizers to come out ( we didn't complaint ) then our dinner came I ordered  pud see ewe and pineapple fried rice both with shrimp . when he brought our dinner out there were appetizer plates on the table and he basically had no room to put our dinner down  ( duh how about get rid of those plates first)  his fried rice was wrong he asked for no carrots but with peas it came with no peas and pretty much tasteless,my pud see ewe was ok not bad. When I ordered my I specifically  asked him if they use Chinese broccoli and not regular broccoli he said yes, I told my husband good because in Thailand we use Chinese broccoli and of course it came with regular broccoli. NEVER ONCE the waiter came back to check on us to see how's our dinner or see if my husband need more soda  which the glass was empty!! when we got the bill of course it was wrong!  
Well The only reason why I gave 1 star because my dish was eatable!!!! both wait staff need restaurant serving antiques for sure."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place based on the reviews, but that quickly changed once I pulled into the lot. It's lunch time and no one was parked right out front. I don't know, but that's usually not a good sign for me. If you're not poppin' at lunch, I'm automatically skeptical. I still went in, and the waiter said I could sit anywhere, well I had my choice of all but one table that was occupied. I sat and looked at a menu which was already on the table. I knew I wanted curry, and they had a pretty nice selection. I decided on the Bok Choy curry with chicken. I was disappointed because there was no lunch menu. I kind of wanted an egg roll, so I asked if I could do a half order because there's no way I'm going to eat 4 egg rolls by myself. The waiter said \"no we don't do that\". No egg roll for me :( No starter soup or wontons or anything. The waiter sat a big white bowl of curry in front of me and said \"enjoy\". I had to ask for rice! I mean who serves curry without rice? Well they get a 3 because the curry was wonderful. At a level 3 on a 5 spice scale, it was perfect and it hit the spot. I'm not sure if I'll return, but if I do it will probably be for convenience when I'm in the area and craving Thai food or with someone. I don't think it is the best for a solo diner at lunch time."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good place to eat on the West Valley and this place was a good place to eat.  A part that disappoints me is giving a negative review on the food and the service.  The staff is great but management needs to reassess what is important good customer service or the quick buck.  My recent order consisted of dry chow mein with no flavor, lack of sauce in the spicy eggplant, and my pad thai was dry.  I called to address my issue and management wanted me to drive back to return the food since management needed to visually see it.  Coming from a service industry why would I call if I didn't receive what I always expect.  As a result, they are losing a valued customer and be warned if you have a complaint,  bring it back or else you are out of luck."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying the 2 stars is really only because I've had a good experience here in the past. Tonight my experience couldn't have been worse. Upon entering we didn't get greeted for at least 5 minutes. A server came over to seat us was  apologizing for the lack of attention, gave us our menus and scurried away. He seemed to be the only one paying attention to anyone. We then sat for 1/2 hour waiting for someone to take our order, which seemed to be the theme tonight as the table on both right and left of us were dealing with the same issue. Another 1/2 hour went by and the simple spring rolls we ordered must have been ordered straight from Thailand because when I asked a different waiter to check on them, they hadn't even been started yet. Yay finally the spring rolls come and now I sit here 25 minutes later awaiting my food, the restaurant is about 50% full and I'm getting hangry! Where is my waiter??? No idea.... Maybe he went to Thailand to get my food! I'm sorry Sala Thai but you all need to get your shit together, especially on a Friday night!


Ok I am upping my stars on this place after almost a year of not going. I just have to say, my issue was never about their food, food has always been stellar. The service was clearly lacking. Tonight the guys serving were on point. They were very attentive and friendly, definitely renewed my faith in this lil Thai place."}
{"text":"Just found this place this morning...WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE SALA THAI??? Spring rolls: perfect. Phad thai (chx): amazing. But the green chicken curry...the green curry, that's my girl. WOW. Ordered a 3 hotness, could've done a little hotter, but MY GOODNESS, sooooo good. Savory, good heat but still good flavor, sauce not too thin/too thick, chx+vegs cooked PERFECTLY. 

Cannot wait to go back soon and try the rest of the menu. Everything scratch-made, fresh, and incredible. Go eat here; you're welcome"}
{"text":"Food is good but pretty basic. I'd recommend this as a starter place for anyone just trying out Thai for the first time, but it's nothing special"}
{"text":"Decided to try his place as its new and close to work. I got my meal to go, it was a bit slow considering there were not a lot of people there. 
When I got my order, I decided to order a Thai tea to go. It's a bit pricey for what you get. A small to go cup was $2.50

I also didn't get utensils or napkins in my bag to go, there were a couple young kids working there. Needs some training on the menu but I will be back. The food was good and I'm looking forward to trying more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service and yummy gluten free options. Drunken noodles with pork is outstanding."}
{"text":"Yet another shining example why American Food sucks. 

This place has all my favorite Never-Foods. Puts some other Thai (that shall remain mention-less, cos they're not worth mentioning) places to shame.

Second time here and still can't complain."}
{"text":"This is my second time trying this place since they've opened. The first time I got the pad Thai which was so tart that I couldn't even finish it. This time I tried the beef pad see ew & was completely underwhelmed. The noodles were almost dry, beef had almost no flavor. We coated it in soy sauce but it didn't help much. Since this was our second time trying & still being so disappointed it's safe to say this will be our last."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We ordered 3 different plates (sweet and sour chicken, massamun curry were 2) and everything tasted great. Only waited a few minutes for a table even though they were busy."}
{"text":"I was hoping this place was better because it's so close to home. Sadly, it's slightly below average and there are much better places in the valley that I will drive to even though they are further away. I review Thai food restaurants a lot because I have a lot of experience with it, authentic, home made, restaurant, etc. and this one is somewhere forgettable and I would be ok not eating at again. Siam Thai in Phoenix is the place to go in the valley and there is at least 4 more restaurant that are better than this. Service was super slow and they even got our order wrong. We ordered chicken larb (5 stars), beef red curry (also 5 stars but came in the form of no star chicken panang curry), spring rolls with shrimp, and pad see ew. All underwhelming. The curry was ridiculously watery and he veggies in it were still raw, the larb was too chunky (supposed to be minced meat but it wasn't consistent) and the portions were small compared to most other Thai restaurants. Even this white rice was hard either from sitting in the cooker too long or not cooking it with enough water. 

This place will probably do ok in this area where most people who live here don't even know a single Thai person and being one of the few ethnic people in the area, I understand that my opinion is a minority opinion because people around here only know what they know and if they haven't had anything better then this place would be sufficient."}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service, quiet and comfortable seating. Overall, we will come back for more and bring our friends here. 
Eggrolls different from what I'm used to, still good, nonetheless.  
Wonton soup, chicken, was delicious, fresh bok choy, cabbage, carrots, broccoli, great broth, yum. Will certainly order again. 
Roasted duck was loved by hubby, flavor excellent, loved the veges too. 
Thai iced tea and soda refilled without asking. 
Aroma of freshly cooked foods as soon as we walked in the door. Outdoor seating available as well. 
Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I will be back. The food was fresh and hot!  The service was sensational as well. We shared everything. The Eggrolls were super crisp and hot out of the fryer!  With nice elegant carrot flower for a garnish. Thai basil chicken was very tasty and they don't skimp on portions or rice. I was ok with my drunken noodle selection but I would try others next few visits. 

A couple Watch Outs:

1. They offer the heat level on each dish from 1 - 5.  3 and 4 were very very unpleasantly hot. So I would advise 1-2 even for you superheroes out there. 

2.  The fish sauce and peppers are also very spicy. Eat the peppers at your own risk. Whew!

Good food. I recommend!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd give this place a go since it is a newer spot and I love Thai food. I pulled in around 1P.M. On a Tue. My overall impression when I walked in the door is a very clean environment with updated furniture and decide along with a full bar.

I have to say although I was impressed with the looks of the place when I walked I the door, I was quite scared that I was the only customer. With a total staff of five people working four of them were lounging away in the booths waiting for a customer to come in.

One of two waiters jumped to his feet and greeted me and sat me down where I was comfortable and met with my menu already on the table. A glass of water showed up quickly after that and I was given suggestions for ordering since I was a first time visited.

I went with the suggestion of the waiter and my appetizer and food came out at an impressive speed. I figure it shouldn't be long because kitchen had no orders when I came in. The food was good, not great. I liked it enough I would come back and try others. The spice level is 1-5, I ordered a four and it came out according to the spice level I ordered. 

In conclusion this needs a second and even a third try because they have a lot going for them. The food was good, the environment plesant and great service. I will try different entrées and hope for greatness because I love me some Thai food."}
{"text":"Don't know...... either inconsistent ......Or are some dishes are better than others??????......Maybe it depends on who's cooking???????

I'm happy that on my way in I saw a grade \"A\" health inspection and I am also very happy the spicy basil dishes we had last time were very good.

We thought we'd try some different things this time.

We started with Potstickers. They came out fried and the filling wasn't very flavorful but what I didn't care for most was the texture of the filling. It was solid and creamy like an omelet. I thought that was weird.

I had the spicy lemon salad. Now that was pretty good! I liked the flavors and the chicken was good too. The only thing not right about the salad was the pineapple chunks. I couldn't identify  was they did to the pineapple. Canned pineapple would have been better.

My husband had the dan dan noodles. Beef chewy and sauce was not the best. Not balanced and very smokey.

My last visit was very good...

Either inconsistent

Maybe some dishes better than others

Perhaps it depends on the chef that's on?

Don't know"}
{"text":"I would have given them all 5 stars but every time I order a carry out, they mange to get something wrong and ask if I wanna come back to get it?! Uh no I want my order the way I ordered it in the first place!!!! Foods great but they need to listen better to their callers for take out !"}
{"text":"Ambience is nice and quiet. The food tastes fresh but not authentic Thai. I will keep my search on for authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai place in town. The ambiance isn't awesome, but the food and the service are.   The happy hour is amazing - appetizers and full sized entrees that they change periodically, and at great prices."}
{"text":"I've always heard such great things about this place and finally got around to try it! Amazing Thai food!! So fresh!! The spring rolls and chicken pad thai are my favs...i'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food and service are fast and fantastic!!! Highly recommend this place. We ordered our food at a level 4 and it was the perfect amount of spicy!!"}
{"text":"I'm from California where my love of Thai food began. I came to AZ, and found out very quickly how HARD it is to find good: authentic, fresh, and absolutely delicious Thai food. When I walked into Sala Thai the ambience was exquisite! The friendly smiles and attentive service were absolutely welcoming:) When I bit into my yummy fried tofu, I was so happy and satisfied! I had the yummy Tom Yum Spicy Soup, and drank plenty of water!!! Enjoy this awesome place:)"}
{"text":"After a couple visits here, I feel like Sala Thai is a solid choice for getting your Thai fix. There aren't many Thai places in the area so I'm just grateful for this one being available. Friday night was busy but not too crowded around 5pm-ish, and with the Thanksgiving holidays coming up, all restaurants were packed so we were relieved to get in here without a wait. There was a little line though due to lots of take out orders.

Appetizers:
Tom Kra Gai - Coconut Milk Soup. Ordered medium spicy. Tasty coconut milk, nonetheless with tender chicken. The spiciness was closer to mild but still enjoyed this a lot.

Fried Calamari - also very tender. No chewy here! The breading was similar to that of onion rings but not the beer batter fried, the other type of breading with the little flakes but darker in color. 

Side(s):
Pineapple fried rice - we ordered with pork. Medium spicy chosen. Not too oily. Flavorful and definitely will order every time!

Entrees:
Duck curry - loved this last time but alas, this time.. they were out.. so sad..

Yellow curry- ordered with chicken with medium
spicy. The curry was more runny than I'd like but at least the flavor was still good. I took it home since I didn't finish it all at the restaurant with all the other stuff we ordered. After sitting overnight and reheating it, it was perfect! The flavors just marinaded on the potatoes and chicken overnight.

Beef mussaman - ordered hot spicy. Yes, it did have a lingering burn but still retained flavor. My husband loves this dish so he orders it every Thai place we go. 

They have a chalkboard full of specials too so you can always try something different when you come here. There's a little patio outside and they do handle larger groups of 8-10 if needed. I definitely like the staff and the service even when they are busy. Good comfort food to be had!"}
{"text":"This my offices go to take out place! Everything is fabulous but I especially love the drunken noodles and the veggies with chicken. Be warned only order over a spice level three if you can handle the heat!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Food comes quick and consistently amazing. LOVE the drunken noodles! Watch spice levels because anything over 2 is hot! Food comes out hot and fresh every time."}
{"text":"Yellow Curry and Beef Salad were unreal! I want to go back tomorrow to explore the menu further! This will be a go to spot for me."}
{"text":"This restaurant makes fresh delicious thai food.  Waiter was knowledgeable on vegan and helped my daughter get a vegan meal.  She enjoyed it tremendously!  She said it was the best veggie broth ever!   My husband had a steak bbq and he loves it."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food! Consistently good. I have had most items on the menu however my favorite is the yellow curry. They have a great happy hour menu too. 

Having said that, the service is less than good. We have been going for over 2 years now, the same staff and it's like we're going in for the first time. It's like they don't recognize us. Come on guys, there are so many choices of places to eat in this area a little staff training, customer service and relationship building would do great things for your business."}
{"text":"Good to have a new Thai place in the area. 

Came for lunch and had the Panang curry and the pad Thai. 

First- the Panang curry.....was great. We got it as a \"3 spice level\" and could have easily gone up a few notches....but had great flavor and we really enjoyed it. 

Pad Thai- was good but not my favorite version of the dish. I would probably get something different next time. 

The food was hot and fresh and we'll probably end up
Going back here once in a while. 

Only complaint was that there were little fruit flies all over the place which was annoying....AND I found one in my water."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place after reading the mixed reviews. It was fantastic. Pad Thai, Panang and Teryaki Chicken were delish. Nice to have a place on our side of town."}
{"text":"This place is always incredible. Huge plates, great prices, and warm, welcoming service. We've dined here several times. The first time we came was the grand opening and it's been consistently great ever since."}
{"text":"Went from 4-3 stars as of today. Will try again for sure, but the food was bland and to salty, not sure how this is even possible! (food was a 2-1 star). Ordered pad-Thai... was this it? Not sure what we got but it was bland... extremely! Also it should come with lime... Ours came with lemon? Also it was very dry, very little sauce used or possibly old, maybe over cooked?The curry was off as well. New cook possibly? If so please re-train them. Will definitely try again, but if the quality is this poor again, then we will drive the extra 10+ miles for the 32nd st and Shea location. So many weird experiences this time around, what happened?"}
{"text":"First time trying and it was wonderful!  Really enjoyed the Pad Thai and the Pumpkin Curry.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I am new to the area and wanted some Thai food. I placed my order in Peoria but found myself in Phoenix! They were so nice. They cancelled the order in Peoria and prepared my order in Phoenix. Food was delicious. Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"This was a big disappointment. First time here tonight and besides taking over 40 minutes to be done the food was terrible. The beef pad Thai was chewey and hard to eat, the Orange shrimp went into the trash because one bite and we were afraid to get sick. I never write reviews, but this is definitely not a 4 star establishment. Food quality is a 2 at best."}
{"text":"Great place! Very happy to have another delicious Thai Restaurant in the area. High quality food, great service and a reasonable price. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"What the heck! Ordered two items for carry out. One was the seafood hot pot soup. We have eaten there many times and usually order that dish- and always ask for zero spiciness since my mother cant eat anything hot. When my family got home and tried the soup, it was so spicy they were all choking on it. They tried calling the restaurant many times and no one was answering the phone. I was on my way home from work when my sister called and asked if I would stop by and pick up a new soup. They refused to give me a refund or remake the soup since they could not verify the spiciness. My sister went back with the soup, they tried it and claimed it was not spicy. We had to ask MULTIPLE times for a refund since the soup container was still FULL since we did not eat it- mind you this was at least 25 min from our house each way. Bad customer service, inconsistent food, rude owner/manager, no one answers the phone, way understaffed. Not eating here anymore."}
{"text":"We tried the yellow curry with beef and the panang curry with beef, for take out.  As mentioned in several other reviews, the curry is very soupy, but the overall flavor is good (I would give Sala 2.5 stars if there was an option).  I ordered mine spice level 2 and my husband wanted spice level 3.  Both were pretty spicy in our opinion, and we couldn't tell much difference between the 2 and 3.  I tasted my husband's beef (panang), and his was tender and pretty tasty.  For some reason, the beef in my dish (yellow curry) was very chewy and hard to break down and swallow.  I don't really see us ordering from here again, which is a shame because the arrowhead area could use good thai place!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and every time it's great! Awesome service and incredible food. I wish I could say I've ordered a lot of different items from the menu but I always usually get the same thing because it's so good!! Thai fried rice and green curry!!! The pad Thai is really good too. I love coming here definitely my fave Thai place in Peoria!"}
{"text":"Food is alright - could be more flavorful and authentic but it's okay for Peoria and if you want a quick, cheap meal. I've been going here for quick thai food for the last 2 years and I'd say that  50% of the time my order is wrong, and staff response was usually different levels of rude (especially from young, fair-skinned male server). This is very important to me because my preferences are not a matter of preference, I have an allergy to the ingredient that I request not to be on my food.

2 instances stand out - 

Once on the way to work I ordered a meal for pick-up so that I could swing by and make it to work on time. Upon picking up my order I realized they made the complete wrong thing and had to have it remade, adding a little bit of stress to my day. The server had the nerve to approach me and say \"Running late for work, huh?\" to which I responded \"Well I would have been on time if my order was made properly\". He didn't even acknowledge the inconvenience it caused.

The last straw was the last time I ordered a meal for pick-up, which was again made improperly. This time I made it all the way home before realizing the mistake had been made. I called back once, explained to the person on the phone that my order had been made improperly, and was hung up on. I called back, thinking the line had disconnected and when the server heard it was me they hung up again! Because I could not eat food that I am allergic to I drove back to demand my order be properly made and you should have seen the shocked look on the server's face when I walked in with my wrong order. They remade the food but did not comp the meal or apologize for HANGING UP TWICE.

Safe to say I will not be giving them any more of my money. 

My suggestion is to definitely go somewhere else that has more authentic, flavorful thai food with respectful service."}
{"text":"This place has awesome authentic Thai food as my wife and I eat here several times a month.  The spice level isnt consistent so we always go low an add to it if need be.  The two young gentlemen that work the front always take care of us whether we get order for pick up or dine in.  They are always professional and the order is 100% corrrect all the time.

I would recommend this place especially for the west valley!!  Job well done to all the staff!!"}
{"text":"Good place for thai food luckily since it is the only thai option in the area, the happy hour from 2 to 5 is a great deal."}
{"text":"2nd time at this location.  Greeted promptly and seated. Order taken promptly.  Waited 25 min for appetizer that was discovered to be 'forgotten'.  Meal came out moments later followed by forgotten appetizer.  Never asked for a refill on drinks.  Mgr? was apologetic for mishap and comped app.  Food was good, service not so much.  And don't come if you're in a hurry.  I love this place just not the service"}
{"text":"Very good food and flavor and good sized portion, prefer more fresh herbs, other than that vey good and very nice pleasant server :)"}
{"text":"The wait staff was lackadaisical... very frustrating because just 8 months ago we loved it because of
the service and food. Fried tofu was the absolute 
Worse I ever had. They actually breaded it & served it with some horrible soy sauce derivative. I have always had it just stir fried without breading and served with delicious peanut sauce and a small dish of a chopped cucumber sweet chil sauce. Not here! And they could care less if you don't like it. My husband and I are never going back."}
{"text":"Our first time here. Our experience was very pleasant. When we walked in, we were greeted right away and sat at a booth. We ordered crab wontons as appetizer, sweet and sour chicken and soup. We both enjoyed our meals. We will definitely be back to try more items from the menu. I wish them nothing but success."}
{"text":"This place open next door to me over a year ago, but had my own favorite Thai Restuarant in Central Phoenix,  I have gone to Sala Thai and asked them to prepare some of my favorites with a twist.  Now I don't need to drive to get gret Thai Food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant.  The drunken noodles are amazing. I love the fresh springrolls.  Our waiter was quick and observant."}
{"text":"There's not enough \"mom & pop\" restaurants in NW Phoenix, but this is my families go-to Thai place on this side of town!
The menu has plenty of options even for people that may not know if they like Thai food & the prices are well set!"}
{"text":"We went for a quick dinner after work. Shared the drunken noodles and egg rolls. Everything was delicious and fresh tasting. Like the fact that wimps like us can opt for no spice. I had a tai tea which was great and the hubby had a couple of beers. Got out of there for just a little over 20 dollars. We highly recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Always loved Thai food so when I moved to Phoenix I wanted to find a local place. I went with a classic - the Pad Thai, and was not impressed. Not bad, but not great. After a few months I decided to give it another shot (maybe due to lack of Thai choices in the area) but this time was a lot happier - hence the 4 stars. The masaman curry made up for my first experience. It was quite tasty, and was a lot of food for the price. The staff was friendly and had the food ready very quickly. Overall, it's worth a try if you're looking for quick Thai food in glendale. 

Warning: anything above a 3 on the spicy level is extremely spicy (borderline not edible), and I'd consider myself a fanatic of all things spicy. A 2 was perfect for me."}
{"text":"This is not what I was expecting I ordered Thai BBQ Chicken and Fried Rice.  This is a grilled chicken breast and some white rice with a few peas and carrots thrown in. I won't be going back what a waste of $14. Two stars the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"First visit today.  It was early in the afternoon and we were the only ones in there.  We ordered the yellow curry with chicken and spicy pumpkin basil entrees.  The curry was pretty watered down.  It could have used a little more chicken.  It was mostly potatoes.  And I was a little disappointed they did not serve rice with it.  Both were just OK.  We did order spring rolls for an appetizer which were very good.  There was a notice posted on the door that they have applied for a liquor license.  I didn't like the fact that the server asked more than once how were we doing.  I felt like we were being rushed.  As someone else mentioned, there were little fruit flies buzzing over our food.  Sala Thai: leave a bowl of vinegar out overnight and it will solve that problem."}
{"text":"Other than the restaurant being pretty warm (their AC must be on the fritz) the food was great and the service was excellent! We tried the Tom Kha coconut soup (great spice) and the pad thai, both are great for sharing! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Picked up some dinner to take home to hungry people on our way home from the water park. Ordered pad thai, fresh spring rolls, pa-nang curry and another curry (can't remember). We ordered 2's and 3's for most of the items, but they were spicier than that. Still good. Everything was really delicious!"}
{"text":"The absolute best Thai Food.  Purchased some food one day then went back the very next day.     I crave there food....I love this place and the staff is just awesome"}
{"text":"What is it with the bland, crappy quality food in the Phoenix area??  It's sad if people think this is real Thai food.  I guess I'm used to So Cal, Denver, Vegas....but, I've been going here for the past year or so.  The green curry and the appetizers have always been pretty good, but my last visit will probably be exactly that.....my last.  The food quality has gone from decent to sub par.  I ordered the green curry and tofu with vegetables.  The vegetables were straight out of the freezer (like mixed carrots, peas, green beans), curry was not spicy. Other dishes we had, the sauce is sticky and comes straight out of a jar - it's barely edible.  Nothing authentic about this place - I could make better at home.  As I've said in another review about the Asian options in AZ.....stick with a chain like P.F. Chang's or Pei Wei....the food is always consistent and good!!  Tired of the expensive, bland, and sub par options in so-called authentic restaurants around here."}
{"text":"We got takeout here last night. Yellow curry chicken and drunken noodles with chicken. They were both good, I would probably say choose atleast medium level spicy, mild was tasty, but not even a little spicy, but it's always trial and error with a new Thai place. I am so glad my new apartment is nearby, I will certainly be here again."}
{"text":"Great little Thai food place in Peoria. Try the curry, you won't be disappointed! The catfish is fresh and is delicious! Crab rangoon's and egg rolls are a perfect starter and come out piping hot! I will be back to get my Thai fix!!"}
{"text":"We were passing through the area and saw the reviews on Yelp and Google and decided to give it a shot. We had a wonderful meal. Everything from the spring rolls to the curry and rice noodle dish was excellent. The vegetables were so fresh and the flavors were perfect. I absolutely love Thai food and I am pretty skeptical about most places, but I would definitely return here again. The service and ambiance were great too. Loved our meal and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Had the Pad Thai and Coconut Soup with Chicken. The portion sizes were very small, barely enough to share. Place was clean. But we came for lunch and they Do Not Have A Lunch Menu! We are not looking for full entrees at lunch time otherwise I would be a regular at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Love this place. We order from here regularly and they are constant. Chicken Pad Thai is awesome. We go with a #2 on spice level. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My friend & I have been coming here for about a month for lunch & most of what we've tried is good. So I brought my while family on a recent Fri night. We made reservations so we had a table waiting for us. We arrived separately & after waiting awhile, I went up to the counter to have someone take our food & drink order. For appetizers, we ordered cream cheese wontons & spring rolls. For our dinner, I ordered drunken noodles with chicken which is my favorite. We also ordered noodle soup with chicken, noodle soup with beef, sweet & sour chicken & lo mein with chicken. Each dish came out separately & our last 2 dishes came out when the rest of us finished our dinner. The chicken in the soup was tender but broth had no depth & veggies were non existent. S&s chicken is Not battered & fried. Skimpy on the chicken. Chicken lo mein was wet & cabbage & broccoli were the only veggies. Everyone was very disappointed in the service & the food & how slow the food came out. Needless to say my family won't be coming back but I will still come for the drunken noodles."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I was excited to discover Sala Thai. The staff was super nice, friendly, efficient and welcoming. The menu is large and quite varied. We tried a few items including chicken satay and spring rolls appetizers, a Tom Kha soup and a chicken penang curry.

The flavors were not as great or complex as I was expecting compared to other restaurants I have been to which is the reason for my three star review. The food was delivered to our table extremely fast which was nice but at the same time I felt a bit rushed."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! They have a huge menu, so you're bound to find something you like. Even my boyfriend who hates everything except burgers and chicken fingers liked the steak/chicken stir fry noodles. I ordered the Spicy Bamboo Shoot dish with chicken in medium spice.... sooo good. Very fresh, which is one of the reasons I love Thai food."}
{"text":"Love their curries and spicy basil fried rice, very friendly staff and food always comes in a timely manor, keep it up guys."}
{"text":"It was a tough choice between two and three stars, but I rounded up based simply on the fact that the food merited the extra.  

I showed up with a party of four at around 7 on a Sunday night, and it was pretty crowded. Usually that's a good sign. We waited by the front door, but no one came out to greet us, so after 2-3 minutes, I walked into the counter area where they were sorting take out orders and asked to be seated. 

Someone came by and offered menus and water. And then they were gone. Like for a while. Like long enough that I had to eventually flag someone down just to take our order. 

They didn't have my standard dish I order at every Thai place on the planet, Pad Prik King, but they had something not too far off of it in the form of spicy green beans. One of the people in my party ordered a shrimp dish, one had a rice dish, and another ordered Panang curry. They brought out the rice dish first, and then we waited. And waited. For like another 5-6 minutes before they brought out the green bean dish and the Panang. And then we waited. And waited. 

We asked twice about when the shrimp dish would be coming out, and were assured it was on its way, and was delayed because, according to the waiter, \"shrimp takes a long time to cook.\"  

Right...

As the three of us were more or less finishing up our dishes, the shrimp dish finally arrived.  Luckily, it was good. So was everything else, to be honest.  The food isn't knock-your-socks-off fantastic, but it's good enough, and if it wasn't for the abysmal service, I'd probably consider eating here again.  Maybe I'll consider it as a viable take out option, where the staff doesn't have the same opportunity to ignore me.  

Bottom line:
1. The place looks nice enough, although there are plenty of Thai places in the valley with far better ambiance and less of a \"fast food\" feel to them.  
2. The Panang curry is pretty damn good.
3. Apparently, the shrimp was good. I wish I could remember the name of the dish.
5. C'mon, man!  No Pad Prik King???
6. C'mon, man!  No beer or wine?

Come for the food. Stay because you're still waiting for someone to take your order and/or bring it to your table."}
{"text":"I can't really give this average.  I ordered the Pa-Nang Curry.  It was okay, but not spectacular.  The restaurant was clean and the service was friendly.  However I guess my two big complaints are that 1) the menu is at least 50% Chinese, and 2) the dishes are rather large and quite expensive.  If you are going there with just 2 people and order 3-4 things you get way too much food and end up spending in excess of $40.  It would be nice if you could order smaller portions for a bit less.  And the problem with so much Chinese food on the menu is that the Thai portion is so abbreviated that there isn't really much selection.  The place would be better named \"Sala Asian.\"

So, I guess this is not going to be where I go for Thai food.  Unfortunately."}
{"text":"First time visit, and so glad we finally tried it! The place was pretty busy, which was nice to see. The food was fresh, hot, and very tasty. Will definitely be back and plan to try it for takeout. 

Update 9/2/16 - where to begin? Service was prompt when we arrived. Order was taken and appetizers came quickly and were fresh and tasty. Then everything went sideways. 

One of our two entrees arrived, and it was good, but he had ordered a 2 heat level and there was no heat. No mention of my order. No water refills - no sign of our waiter anywhere. Two tables arrived and one finally abandoned hope of ever ordering. Still no sign of my entree. Finally I got up and found someone who explained that they had to remake my dish - would've been good info to have earlier. We chose to cancel and take the check. 

When she came with the check, she brought my order packed to go and didn't charge us. Very kind, but better service and clear communication would have gone farther. When we got home I popped open the container and found the heat that was missing from the other dish. The heat I didn't want. Ugh!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The yellow curry is amazing and spicy eggplant is perfectly cooked. We happened to go on a Sunday at 3:00 which was happy hour. We had spring rolls, veg tempora, curry and spicy eggplant for only $30 and the portions were so big we took home leftovers. Staff is very nice and attentive. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Yellow curry was great and very generous portions. No lunch menu which is a bummer. A bit pricey for lunch. Best Thai in west side."}
{"text":"Fresh roll with shrimp were great. We enjoyed the Phad Thai, Spicy Basil with chicken, and pork curry. Good food and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Very good Thai, best Tom kra coconut soupin area. I love that they have the mango sticky rice dessert, can't find that anywhere."}
{"text":"I will let you know
Well certainly love their service.. & the curry shrimp dish with Jasmine rice was amazing, I ordered level 3 and that was perfect.. it had a bite"}
