{"text":"I'm glad the intoxicating sweet aroma of crepes doesn't make it out beyond the front door or else this quaint little place would be packed, with nowhere to sit. Luckily, it was a Tuesday morning so we shared our brunchtime with just a handful of other lucky patrons. Great cozy atmosphere, tasty yummies and lovely, gratious service."}
{"text":"Their service here really is abysmal. I dropped in while visiting my home town for 2 weeks. My girlfriend and I were seeking a nice relaxing spot the rest our feet and enjoy a dessert in the late afternoon. We ordered the crepes with pears as well as a coffee for me and a cappuccino for her.

No drinks nor food. Then the food arrived. I mentioned that I had ordered the coffee and she brought it 2 minutes later. I figured me mentioning my coffee would jog her memory about her cappuccino, however I should have known better. After making our way through atleast half of the mediocre crepe, we forgot about it and carried on: the moment for it had passed.

I ordered in French, so there's no reason she should have misunderstood. While we were waiting for our drinks, the waitress was busy washing dirty dishes. Priority 1 are dirty dishes or the customers you already have? Should be a no-brainer but not in this case.

I liked the atmosphere of the venue, however when we went in it was relaxing. Maybe 15 minutes later they put the radio on, some loud French radio station which blew the mood slightly as well. When we left, of course she left the cappuccino on the bill, which we had to fix. She realized then how much she had buggered it up.

Ultimately, I'd suggest avoiding this stop and the owner should wise up and liquidate the useless server (in a relatively down economy, you can do much better). There are much better venues nearby on St. Denis like Juliette et Chocolat,  Maison de Thé Camellia Sinensis, Brulerie St-Denis and Café Gitana to name afew..."}
{"text":"When you enter this cafe you are overcome by the most fantastic smell of cooking crepe batter. The set up is cozy and relaxed which is nice with all the bustle on Saint Denis. As soon as the door closed it seemed like the noise on the street just melted away.

We entered right after dinner for some desert crepes. I ordered a raspberry/banana/chocolate which was the size of a dinner plate and perfect amount of tart cooked raspberry mixed with sweet banana/chocolate. My boyfriend ordered the lemon crepe which tasted fantastic as well. 

The staff had some trouble speaking English but there is an English and a French menu so you can always just point at what you want. I didn't find this to be a huge issue and the staff was so friendly and accommodating that it made the language barrier a non-issue.

With the addition of a pint of beer the meal came out to about 20 CAD which I would gladly pay again for the fantastic crepe and lovely dining experience."}
{"text":"The crepes here are really fantastic.  I had a mushroom, bechamel sauce and asparagus crepe and by the time I was done I was swirling my finger around the plate so I could get every last calorie into my body. So yummy.  

We also ordered french fries but they never came. By the time we finished our crepes we were so full we were sort of happy about the mess up so we didn't mind.  

The waitress was also lacking in that she never returned to our table and we practically had to send out smoke signals to get a check.   We had also planned to have another drink but since she never came back that was a no go too.  Even with the bad service I'd go back without any hesitation."}
{"text":"We waited and waited and waited to be served... It was a nice and warm September day and we were hungry so we waited some more, but after almost 20 min unsuccessfully trying to get the attention of the waiter.... we left!

Probably won't be coming back..."}
