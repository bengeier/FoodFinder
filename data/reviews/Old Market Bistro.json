{"text":"This is in reference to reviews on a previous site.

I've always wanted to tell a customer who is complaining about something at a restaurant I am working at. \"So where do you work? I'd love to come and watch you at your job and tell you what you are doing wrong\" your response would be something like \"You know nothing about my job, you have no idea the pressures I go thru and what is expected of me every day\" hmmm what a thought  
 
First of all I have ate at Old Market Bistro many times and have never left unsatisfied. I do know in their short time of life the Bistro's staff has improved as most places do as they grow and learn what direction to go in. The food is amazing, yes the portions are large, but we do live in the Midwest where LARGE portions were born.  
 
As for reading in previous reviews about their prices being to high, I have to ask those people \"where do you eat for cryin out loud, they could cut the portions in half and leave the prices right where they are and still be in the ballpark\"

I have been in the Food Industry for over 20 years and have found there many kinds of customers in this world but these are the ones that a remembered the most:  
 
Those who complain about portions, either to big or to small.  
If it is too large take the rest home and be happy you have two meals for the price of one. To small of portion remember that to eat healthy means to leave a table still hungry not stuffed.  
 
Those who complain about the price, everything is always to expensive.  
If only you knew. The number one comment made by people about restaurant owners is \"Wow, this place is amazing the owner must make millions\" Reality check, restaurants profits are only between 3% and 5%. So the next time you dine out and you get your bill for $20.00 after all said and done what the owner see's of that payment (if what you had was a hot item) is about $1.00. With less diners dining out and prices raising across the entire board (rent, utilities, min wage, etc..) that $1.00 keeps getting smaller.  
 
Those who just complain when they dine out, and write or talk about it.  
They just want to be heard, these people need to understand in your words and your thoughts on locations can totally effect the lively-hood of the person who works at and owns that location.

The waitstaff person who depends on the place to be busy so they can afford their college and/or life-style. And of course the owner who puts his/her heart and soul into what they do every day 12+ hours a day 7 days a week, who depends on people to walk thru their doors and enjoy an evening dining and help the owner keep the doors open another evening.  
 
I am sorry to Kipp and his employees that I chose to write this on their review but it something that I find to be way to abused now a days. \"Opinions\" which is what every review is, not the hand of some great God pounding on a hammer and chisel into the Rock of the Laws.  
 
The Expectation Bar when you dine out needs to be adjustable for each establishment.  
Each one is not the same as the last and again over time they do change. Believe it or not (more independents than chains) take the reviews and change everything they read that was negative and for what reason because one voice had a bad experience one time. This could make things better for that one critic but what does it do for the other 100 people or that enjoyed what that place was doing in the first place?  
 
You should always give a place three tries and you should space those experiences out. If you truly want to give a True and Honest Review dine at the establishment 6 times, 3 times just to dine and 3 times to actually critique the experience. You may find your first opinion might have been different than your last (good/bad). Just so you know it does work in reverse as well.  
 
Just remember the next time you choose to share your \"OPINION\" it does effect the business. And well in this economically challenged time I would rather keep a small independent, who is trying to make it thru the first growing months, open.  
So Madison can once again be known for \"INDEPENDENTS\" instead of letting the little guy close so more \"CHAINS\" can sprawl and take away our uniqueness.  
 
I am not a critic and I am not a writer as you can probably tell from my run on sentences and my grammar. But what I am is a person who loves dining out and loves watching people do what they love and dream to do.  
 
Kipp keep doing what you do. Your staff will get there and the City will come to love the little place called \"Old Market Bistro\""}
{"text":"First of all, I've been recommending this place repeatedly to everyone I know since it opened a couple of months ago--it's really close to my apartment and I LOVE it, so I want everyone else to go and ensure its success so I can keep eating there.

The menu is very simple, but it offers a wide array of choices.  A previous reviewer complained that they had to \"make too many decisions,\" but I see that as a positive.  The menu allows you to mix and match pastas or cuts of meat (fish, chicken, steak--portobella for vegetarians) with various sauces, all of which are really delicious.  You can also do a build your own pizza, and I know from experience that they're very accommodating about doing a topping that's not actually on the menu--bleu wasn't listed in the cheeses, but they were happy to put it on a pizza for me.

Their breakfast menu is a similar model, but they have nice classic entrees like eggs benedict and scramblers.  I got one made with only egg whites (they also offer Egg Beaters), and it was delicious and HUGE--I saved half of it for breakfast the next day and it reheated well.  This is typical of their entrees; the prices are quite reasonable ($10-$16 for most entrees) and virtually everything will make at least two meals.  Their biscuits are awesome; I highly recommend them as a side.

I also particularly recommend: their coffee (I had the medium roast; they also have a dark one), their pesto sauce for pasta, their eggplant \"meatballs\" (delicious even to non-vegetarians like me and my boyfriend), their french fries (moderately thick-cut), and their wine selection ($5-8 a glass, and all very nice).

I would avoid: their bacon (not very crisp) and the pomegranate martini (almost bitter and not very strong).

It does seem to me that a lot of their staff is fairly new, but everyone who's served me there has been very friendly and attentive and worked very hard to ensure that I had a great meal there.

I haven't had a chance to try their bag lunches, but they look good (you can also build your own sandwich at lunchtime).  They also do take-out, so you can call ahead and place an order to pick up, which is easy and fast."}
{"text":"We went back here looking to see if it had opened after Porta Alba closed. Thought that it might be the same owner, but apparently not.

I can't see this place succeeding. It is twice the size of Porta Alba, so it is going to have to be even more successful. The decor is the same old same old, with nothing to distinguish it from the hundreds of other restaurants Madison diners have to choose from. On a hot day it was absolutely frigid. 

The menu is boring, just a re-shuffling of the same dishes you can get anywhere. Too many dishes where the diner has to be the chef and pick the ingredients, rather than the chef. Our service took forever, and while the food was actually pretty good, it did not outweigh the other negatives. 

We gave this place a try, but it fails too often for us to go back."}
