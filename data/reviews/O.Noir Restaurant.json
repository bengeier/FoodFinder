{"text":"For me it's not about the food, but about the experience. Not that the food wasnt good, it was, but the experience was so interesting that I would recommend that you give it a try. I would not go again but I would also not miss out on trying it."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy eating in the dark. It's a gimmicky restaurant attraction aimed at yuppies who want to tell their friends how hip they are. Personally, I think seeing your food and its presentation matters; it's a part of the dining experience. More importantly, the meal at O'Noir wasn't nearly good enough to stand on taste alone.

But what really upset me was that our waitress mixed up my order. I ordered lamb chops, my friend ordered lamb shank. She asked who got the lamb. When we clarified that we both did but different entrees she just put the plates down. For a while I just thought my lamb chops were dry. It wasn't till close to the end of the meal when I came across a pitiful cauliflower on my plate that we finally determined that I'd eaten her meal (which wasn't very good) and she had mine (which she said was juicy and tasty... that pissed me off).  Call me an asshole, a waitress should know what's on the plates she's serving. What's more, she hit me in the head with plates. Twice.

In summary, I don't have a single positive thing to say about this place."}
{"text":"Ignore everything you've read about about the food. We had the appetizer of of the day (eggplant with goat cheese) & the surprise appetizer (steak tartare), the filet mignon, and the surprise dessert (strawberry custard). It was all awesome. The filet mignon was one of the best steaks we've ever had. The whole staff was awesome, and the experience was perfect. Definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, really fun experience. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed my experience at ONoir, but i'd probably recommend going only once. 

If you've made a reservation, you're coming for the experience, not the food. I had the eggplant appetizer and Marinaded Shrimp. The quality of the food was very average. The eggplant was soggy and small portioned. The shrimp was delicious, but the accompanying rice and vegetables were over sauced and overcooked. However, the ambiance was great. There was a live jazz band playing behind us, which complimented the mainly French speaking diners who were enjoying their meals. Again, a memorable experience."}
{"text":"What can I say, bad food and poor services does not make up for the unique experience of \"dining in the dark.\" 

The \"experience\"...it was interesting to try and remember where you left things like your water glass and silverware.  Our guide/waiter, Tim, was often difficult to find and other staff members frequently went to retrieve him.

The food...mediocre would be kind.  My companion had the filet which was delivered charred and overcooked.  Since Tim never bothered to check in after dropping of the meals, we eventually got another staff member to find Tim and replacement was requested.  When the replacement arrived it was delivered undercooked this time (medium was requested for the filet).  What was delivered was clearly medium-rare to rare the center of the meat was barely warm on the steak.   My meal, the braised lamb shank, was not much better.  The meat was cooked and seasoned well.  My problem was the rest of the plate. While the menu states that \"All of the dishes are accompanied by the chef's sides\" mine was accompanied by five small cubes of cauliflower which would be hard pressed to be considered as anything more than a garnish.   Desserts were mixed.  One was ok, but the \"crème brulée du Chef\" was on the runny and covered in an overly thick layer of the melted sugar--and honestly it was not very good and I love crème brulée.

All in all I would not recommend dining here."}
{"text":"The experience is the whole point of O.Noir, far more than the food (which is tasty and adequate, but not sublime). The darkness of the dining room is absolute, so there's no real point in panicking or straining to see; just relax, enjoy it, and realize that a) if anyone *could* see you, you'd probably look like a dope, and b) wow, what the busboys must endure when they flip the lights on at the end of the night. 

Or at least that's what my companion and I were thinking, especially when I nudged a gob of butter off my bread plate unawares and then put my hand in it repeatedly for the rest of the night. All in good fun! While my friend proudly insisted he was using his utensils and best table manners, I confess to pushing things around with my fingers...who's gonna know? Then again, maybe he was lying!

We both ordered the three-course surprise meal, and in attempting to guess what we ate were 0-for-3; we could pick out individual ingredients, but got sidetracked by that same ability. If you *do* have any food allergies or other issues, you definitely should mention them up front: our appetizer turned out to be steak tartare, which I'm not likely to have ordered of my own accord--and it was delicious, in fact, but I had some stomach upset the next day, so buyer beware. 

Our waiter was attentive, friendly, and clearly amused by our terrible guessing. And although other reviewers have mentioned loud, rowdy groups, our fellow patrons seemed committed to preserving the experience for everyone: when someone's phone inadvertently lit up a bit of the room for a split second, others booed and hissed goodnaturedly and the guilty party smothered the light immediately. 

If you're up for a unique dinner out, go and immerse yourself at O.Noir, and bring your sense of adventure...but maybe not your favorite white shirt."}
{"text":"I feel like it's odd to rate a place like Onoir using the Yelp scale, because it doesn't really make sense for 2 stars to mean that I've experienced better because truthfully, I've never experienced anything else like it and therefore it must be the best I've experienced (I guess also the worst...), but I honestly feel like the food was pretty bad at this place, and not deserving of more than a star or two given how much you're paying.

I went with some adventurous friends, and we all ordered the surprise for every course. In truth, the food wasn't that surprising. I was expecting to be confused and puzzled and intrigued by every dish, but pretty much once you were able to get the food into your mouth, you were able to identify it easily. The food didn't take advantage of the fact that you couldn't see anything. It was just normal food at inflated prices. Like think food that a college student might try to make to impress a date.

In spite of the bad food, Onoir is definitely something to be experienced. You really can't see anything, and it's odd to try to eat in this manner. You might also experience existential crises while eating if you think too hard about being blind.

Anyway, I think Onoir could really be a five-star restaurant if they were just more creative with the food and took advantage of the fact that their patrons can't see anything, but I guess that'd be too much effort. Until then, this place is just a novelty, but probably not worth the money."}
{"text":"Nous avions hâte de tenter l'expérience. Dans l'ensemble,
L'accueil était bon
La salle à manger était fraîche. Nous devions porter plus. Qu'un t-shirting c'est certain. Souvent, des lumières filtraient par les rideaux. Ils auraient avantage à ajouter un deuxième rideau pour assurer la quiétude de la noirceur. Les chaises d'un confort médiocre. Le lobby devrait être moins éclairer pour l'adoration du retour à la clarté. 
La nourriture n'était cependant pas à la hauteur et le menu laisse présager un plus grand raffinement particulièrement au niveau des prix.
L'expérience en général est bien mais mois ni retournerons pas. L'ambiance était agréable pour l'expérience et il faut retenir que les gens se laissent aller à la découverte donc, on oublie le familial et le romantique.
Nous avons acheté un demi-litre de vin mais je ne crois pas sincèrement que ce soit la quantité que l'on nous a servi. On nous a apporté deux coupe seulement à la moitié donc je dirais max 300-350 ml"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but it's really the experience you are coming here for. The most interesting dining experience I have had in years. Highly recommend to try it once. Go on the weekdays when it's a little less busy and try to stay in smaller groups. It will make the experience a little easier the first time."}
{"text":"5 stars for the experience as a whole.  You must make a reservation and when you show up, you put your cell phones or anything that might produce light in a locker in the dimly lit front lounge.  From there, you are introduced to your server, who is actually blind, and then, taking his/her shoulder, you are led to into the dining room, which is PITCH BLACK.  

The experience is nerve-wracking at first because doing anything in pitch black tends to be uncomfortable for those of us who have taken our vision for granted.  However, eventually you will settle down a bit, but you are constantly reminded of your predicament as you clumsily take a sip of your drink or fumble with your food.  

They say that depriving oneself of one of the five senses will enhance the remaining and after this experience I really believe it.  Taking away my sense of sight, I felt that I could really experience the amazing flavor and smell of the food.  

My favorite part was the conversation...my date and I struck up a conversation with a couple right next to us.  I sincerely feel it was the fact that we could not see them nor them us and consequently could not judge each other visually that led to one of the best conversations I've ever had!  

The service was great and they'll guide you to the restroom if you need.  I think the price is a steal, especially compared to places in Los Angeles and San Diego at around $100/person!  Do this and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"our experience was nothing like what we imagined. we ordered at the bar and then were led downstairs (putting our hands on the shoulder of a visually impaired waiter). It was A LOT louder than we expected when we found our seats. It was difficult to hear my husband from across the table. We were having fun eating the bread he put in the middle of our table- trying to get some butter on it. It's totally dark- your eyes don't adjust. You end up eating with your hands most of the time to avoid poking yourself in the eye with your fork. At first, my husband and I had fun trying to feed each other the appetizers we ordered. They messed up our order though and we ended up eating something we didn't want- which was confusing because we weren't 100% sure of that. We asked the waiter about it and he avoided the question. We ordered a surprise dish for our entree, which was a big mistake. I thought it was fried mushy fish and my husband thought it was beef. It turned out to be fried pork meatballs...gross. The other food wasn't up to par either...you definitely pay for the experience and not the food. About an hour and a half had passed and we were waiting for dessert with very sticky fingers. By this time, we were growing very impatient and had yelled out the name of our waiter four times (that's the only way they will come to your table) without him coming. My husband was really uncomfortable, which made me really uncomfortable. When our waiter finally arrived, we cancelled dessert and headed out.
Could have been a cool experience, but overall very disappointing. Wish it was the quiet culinary experience we were hoping for. We won't be dining in the dark again any time soon."}
{"text":"I went at O.Noir with my co-workers, we were 6. Overall, it is a must try at least once. The experience is amazing, it is something you have to do at least once in your life. 
The food is really basic, not that good, but let me tell you, if you will decide to go at O.Noir, you will go for the unique experience not for the food!"}
{"text":"Went to the place on a Friday night during my stay in Montreal. I really enjoyed the experience more than O did the food. The food wasn't bad persay, but it wasnt great. Had the short rib meal and it was quite bland. Pricing was a little on the pricey side but they do give big portions. Despite being underwhelmed by the food, I would definitely recommend this place. The experience is unmatched and it gives you a greater perspective on being blind."}
{"text":"A must dining experience. The food was pretty good, but the experience of eating in a pitch black environment is the reason to go. You pick your meal before you are led into the pitch black room. You cannot see anything and by anything I mean your plate, your fork, even your hands in front of your face.  I went one time, and I don't think I would go back but it worth going for first timers."}
{"text":"Note that you are supporting integration of the visually impaired to the work force when attending this restaurant. 

I have been here twice already - I cannot get enough! Not only is this is such an unique experience (dining in the dark), the food is quite delicious. They are also very accommodating towards any allergies one may have (gluten, dairy, soy). The menu is modified accordingly. 

I will keep bringing friends here as I love their reactions and the staff is supportive and kind.

Tania."}
{"text":"jeudi dernier le 11 septembre, j'ai été vivre l'expérience de manger complètement dans le noir avec ma cousine, sa fille et son chum.

J'ai vraiment aimé l'expérience.  De plus, la nourriture est vraiment bonne (digne de la grande gastronomie) et supérieur de mon attente.  

Notre serveur Jérémy a été d'une diplomatie remarquable...

Je recommande ce resto sans hésité"}
{"text":"I am giving a 6th star. 

It was an amazing experience, the staff is very friendly and helpful. The whole eating in the dark experiment was worth it.  The food was very tasty Highly recommended ; on my next visit to Montreal I will definitely go there again and of course bring friends."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The crowd was really loud and the whole experience (you have to wait in a crowded room for 15 min before you can sit, we paid for a bottle of wine and only get 2 glasses) was disappointing. The best part was the grilled portobellos, but I can do them way better on my own BBQ. And it's really not cheap for what it is.

Good idea, weak execution."}
{"text":"Incredible food, great music, cool atmosphere, great experience.

HOWEVER,
Make SURE you go with a lively crowd. My restaurant date was so boring that I spent most of my time praying for the next meal course to alleviate my misery.

Definitely get the surprise dessert, yum yum...

Speaking of yum, a hot date is a good idea as well...the naughty things one can do in the dark :)"}
{"text":"I actually made a spur of the moment birthday reservation here without knowing it was an in the dark experience. When we first got there the place looks sketchy and boarded up from the outside but once in the door everything makes sense. Definitely indulge in a surprise course. It is quite hard to figure out what you are eating when you cannot see anything. The food was yummy. The ambience was pitch black. If you are scared of the dark or the unknown you will not be able to handle this."}
{"text":"If anyone has ever wondering what it would be like to dine in the dark, they can try this restaurant.  I have to admit that I was skeptical and intrigued at the same time about such an experience.  Once you enter, you're standing in a bar area where there are lockers to place all your personal belongings.  You may grab a drink but this is also the time to select you menu for the night.  

Once ready, a member of the staff comes out and escorts you in.  Our waitress was the amazing Julie who lead us to our table, explained where everything was and became our eyes in pitch blackness.  The food was tasty.  I had the filet mignon while my fiancée had some type of meatballs.  The only problem came when I couldn't determine if I still had food left on my plate so after a while I forego the utensils and ate with my hands.

There were interesting moments and some good laughs because we realized how much for granted we take our ability to see.  I feel that part of dining seeing the presentation fo the food.  As the saying goes, \"you eat with your eyes first.\"  I would not try this again but I'm glad that I did."}
{"text":"This will be one of the most unique dining experiences you will ever have. Dinner served to you by a blind wait staff as you eat in complete darkness (i.e. blind). My first experience, my eyes really wanted to try to see something. Which in turn made me freak out a bit. Relax. The wait staff will totally take care of you. Even if you spill your wine. Don't worry about buttering your hand instead of your roll. Nobody can see you. This place is loud, because for some reason you talk louder when you can't see it seems. 
Now for the food. \"How do you order without seeing the menu?\" Duh. You order before you go in. You can order a 2 course or 3 course. I had the mushrooms for my starter and then I always get the Filet for my main and then hey, what dessert isn't great? The food is amazing and is more flavorful when your other senses kick in. You can also opt for getting the 'Surprise' dinner and then try to guess what you had after you leave. My guess is you'll guess wrong. 
And it's so good, nobody will see you lick your plate."}
{"text":"This is one of the those experiences that you will remember for a long time, not many places can claim that. Sounds like it may be gimmicky but it truly was an interesting experience. Staff friendly and helpful. Food was good but to get the true experience you need to do the surprise meals, the wife and I each did a surprise course while the other picked and item. Trying to decipher what food has just been placed in front of you with no visual is really challenging and makes you focus on the food much more than usual. Goat cheese and chorizo salad was a nice starter, bacon-wrapped shrimp was a solid entree and finished off with a banana panna cota. All good meals, none were amazing but I enjoyed all three. 

One thing to note is that this can get a bit unforgettable at times, your eyes and brain are desperately trying to get visuals and when they don't get it you can get a bit disoriented. You have to tell yourself to just sit there and let it happen. Don't let this discourage you, it is worth it. I had a week-long vacation all over the area and this is the first thing we tell people about."}
{"text":"Super, recommandé. Bonne expérience O Noir. En plus le service de réservation avec Yelp fonctionne parfaitement."}
{"text":"A really cool joint in Montreal. About a year ago, I had tried O.Noir. The concept is awesome, having dinner in pitch black with waiters/waitresses who are blind. What an amazing experience I had. 

At first, I thought \"having dinner in the dark... that's cool\" but I really didn't think much of it. But until you experience it, you don't realize how neat it is. To sit at a table with a group of friends and have nothing but pure conversations. 

The client care was really nice. It was seamless. Basically you choose your menu items at the beginning and when you get seated that is when the food comes out. 

The food was good, not stellar. But to have the experience is really unique."}
{"text":"We casually walked by it and decided to make a reservation for 2 days later. This place is a real gem. We didn't know what to expect. The staff is amazing and the servers are very funny, making a train in the dark to go to the restroom and to make it to our table was quite the experience. My friend had the orange and ginger chicken with buttered green cabbage and the pear profiterole with chocolate sauce; while I had the lamb shank, braised in red wine, with tomatoes and mushrooms served with cauliflower and potatoes, and for dessert I had Onoir's chocolate mouse with orange glaze and cookie crumbles. The food was amazing, the wine was good, eating in complete darkness was challenging but super-fun. We were shocked we didn't spill the wine and got food all over our shirts. The only downfall is that it's actually a little too loud, but other than that I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not the best food - sometimes very very loud which makes it hard to talk..one of those places you go to only once and never return to."}
{"text":"Dining in the dark?  WOW!  What an experience.  I wish we had something like O Noir in Philadelphia.  My experience eating fillet Mignon in the complete darkeness:

You order your food and drinks at the lit bar area in the front.  After you order, your blind server leads you to your table.  You dine in COMPLETE darkness, no cell phones, lighters, watches, etc.  

We happened to visit on an evening where they had live music, performed by a blind band.

This was so interesting.  There were a lot of people in the dining room, and I had lost my sense of perception.  I also kept looking for light.  I kept finding myself looking for a little ounce of light, so I could see something.  No luck, eventually I gave up.

As far as eating, this part was not as difficult as people think.  They cut your food in a fashion that will help you eat with your utensils.  They also carefully set up your table, and the place setting is very easy to navigate in the dark.  The table even had a hole for your drink.

I would do this again.  A lot of people who I've told about the experience say they would never want to do something like this.  It took a little bit of open-mindedness on my part, but once I got over that - this was a really enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Nut-free kitchen! I was worried about going here with my tree nut allergy, but it turned out to be nut free. (Wish it said so on the website...) The experience was really interesting, but my meal was pretty bad. My friends liked their food, but the vegetarian option when I went was damp and cold. The menu called it a 'roll' and I assumed it was spring rolls; I think it might've been a lettuce wrap. Whatever it was, it was kind of gross. My dessert was good though. Go for the experience, not for the food. Probably still worth it, but only once, for the novelty."}
{"text":"I recommend this restaurant to anyone who has never experienced eating in pitch darkness.  It was truly unforgettable.

Before you get started, you can lock your belongings in the lockers that are located out by the front desk.  You pay afterwards, so you can keep your money in the locker as well.  You literally don't need to bring anything with you.  No phone, no wallet.

At the front desk, you choose what you would want your entrees to be, or you can be more adventurous and choose to be surprised.  

If you choose to be surprised, please be sure to tell them if there is anything you don't like or can't eat.  They will be sure to honor your request.

I am a bit of a pick eater so I only chose to be surprised with dessert.

I came with 3 other girlfriends, and it was a bit of a bonding experience.  

When it comes time to walk through those curtains into the darkness, you will be asked to place one hand in front of the person in front of you, and your group will be escorted to the table by your waiter/waitress (who I heard are blind, but honestly, you couldn't tell and it didn't matter because no one could see anyway).

For the first few minutes I really panicked. I thought I was going to trip or bump into something.  But don't worry, you are in good hands.  Immediately your other senses, namely touch and hearing, are heightened.

Throughout dinner, we heard other groups talking and we spent the entire time guessing how many people were in the restaurant.  At one point, the PENIS game started.  Perfect setting for that game, since no one will ever know if it was you who screamed it the loudest.

The food was decent, maybe not the BEST (which is relative anyway) but it was pretty good.  And though it was hard to see, we all tried to share our food.  Which, added to the surprise.  With each bite, you are wondering what you are really eating, and what flavors you are really tasting. 

Little things like remembering where you put your utensils or your water was even a challenge.

I thought it was an amazing experience that everyone should try.  Try what it feels like to blind for 2 hours and leave appreciative of your vision."}
{"text":"What a great experience! Most others got the description of the experience down - let into a solid black room yada yada...the initial feeling was very scary as if any moment I would trip or fall off an edge or bump into a table. I asked for the bathroom before seating so we were led there but then felt abandoned for a few minutes before our server came back to bring us to our table. I have no idea what the layout of the restaurant is and I'd be very curious to see how they did that. Hearing the voices around me echoing around as if we were in an arena made me think that this place is actually quite vast, but who knows.

Conversation was interesting, I felt more relaxed just to participate in a conversation since my eyes didn't have to do any work. I could sit in a relaxed state and not worry about things like eye contact or proper posture.

The server showed up seldomly, just to bring us our next course. When bringing waters, she spilled a little on me, at least it's just water.

I tried to put a little bit of butter on my bread, but it turns out that I spread an entire container of butter, which I never do. 

The Surprise appetizer was great - when I first tasted it, I thought it was garlic beef cubes, then on closer examination of the texture, I felt that maybe they were clam meat...turned out they were escargot. Not bad!

The veal, served with spicy potatoes, and brocolli and peppers was average, but then again, how would you be able to truly judge the enhanced feeling of dining blind if you were biased with exceptional food?

The mystery dessert was Tiramisu - I thought the caramel was too heavy but the texture and the flavour of the cake was nice. Feeling around was hard with the appetizer and the main that I ended up resorting to using my hands.

Great experience and I would definitely do it again. I recommend going all in on the surprises, but I should remember my list of ingredients I don't like so I don't risk anything in the future."}
{"text":"We came to Montreal for 1 week and brought this groupon. For our first night in montreal, this restaurant was amazing.  This restaurant was completely pitch dark and the service was wonderful. I was worried about previous reviews that said the food was disappointed but I disagree. I enjoyed every course as did my boyfriend. it was great for a one time to try...now I can say that I did a dark dinner."}
{"text":"An out-of-town business contact made a reservation here out of curiosity and lack of better ideas, and asked me if I'd like to join her.  O.Noir turned out to be a fair place for a wine-fuelled get-to-know-you in the dark with an interesting foreign national, but as a dining destination, it didn't pass muster.  The food, what little there was of it, was tasty, but the chore of *finding* it with utensils, the unsuitability of cake à la mode in a fruit coulis as a zero-light dessert, and the lighthearted yet ever-present fear of finding our postprandial selves on Ste-Catherine's sidewalk wearing our respective sauces like batik art transformed what could have been a charmingly grown-up supper into a shared culinary stunt.

I honestly the think the concept would work well as a wine bar, or as a malt whisky tastery, even.  We could have sat in the dark sipping shiraz by feel and swapping murmured horror stories all evening.  But I wouldn't recommend this place for anything resembling a semi-serious dining experience.  The gimmick is too strong."}
{"text":"Been here twice on short trips to Montreal. Definitely worth the experience. Because it's a unique concept, it's really more about the experience than the food (though no complaints about the food either; I was more than happy to go back).

I'm really not sure why there are two-star reviews from people grumbling about having to eat in the dark. Did you not know what the whole point of this place was before you went?

Overall, the food and drinks were satisfying enough for me to feel justified in paying for this. Just make sure you wash your hands before you start eating, because you will most likely need them to find your food!"}
{"text":"When you walk to the restaurant, it looks really sketchy from the outside. But know that inside is a different story. My partner and I came in and first hung up our jackets. We were asked to make our menu selections at the counter before going into the room. I chose duck confit rilette appetizer and glazed pork baby back ribs. My partner ordered the surprise appetizer, along with crispy cornish hen. 

Our waitress led us into a completely pitch black room. I was really nervous walking around in the dark but since she guided us, it wasn't too bad. Once we were seated, we learned to adapt to our surroundings. The fun part was when the food came. We had a really hard time eating from the plate, my partner actually gave up and used his hands. I continued with my fork though - very difficult but such a fun challenge.

In terms of the food, my appetizer and  main was nothing special and a little bland. My favorite was probably my partners surprise appetizer which tasted like salmon tartar salad. His main was a bit disappointing as well. Coffee and tea came with our items, so that was nice. Our waittress was also really good in terms of guiding us on where our utensils were, where foods were located and so forth. 
While the food was not so great, the atmosphere was a different story. It was so fun trying to eat and at the same time, you understand how difficult it is for someone to eat when they can't see. My partner and I tried to share foods - I accidentally placed half my main on his palm without knowing. The best part were the birthdays. Perhaps it was because no one else could see each other, the whole room would start singing happy birthday to that special person. I could be off pitch, and no one suspects who it comes from. 

When we were about to leave, we had to call our waittress back. We were led back to the doors, where our coats were hanging, to pay for the meal. I would  definitely return on a special occasion and highly recommend a try at least once in your lifetime!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!  Dining in pitch black darkness elicits a variety of emotions and sensory responses.  We varied from intensely intrique to momentary claustrophobia to complete awe.  It's true that your other senses are heightened when one is deprived and we used them all in order to complete a basic human function - eating.  

What's most amazing is the opportunity to get a feel for a sliver of the lifestyle of a blind person.  We had to be more explicit in our oral communication, slow our actions down, feel around for object placement (how else would you know if you finished your dinner?), etc.  We loved that some proceeds benefit a blind foundation and that the concept helps with the 70% unemployment rate in that population. 

The food was great. It might be just slightly overpriced but worth it for the experience.  We chose to have surprise appetizers and desserts.  I'd recommend this option... having to use my senses to identify a dish brought a new dimension to the experience.   Comparing our dishes, I preferred the portabella mushroom appetizer, filet mignon main course and the fruit sorbet dessert.  I'd also recommend keeping the wine to a 1 glass minimum... remember, you already have some sensory deprivation that you're not used to!

All in all, an incredibly unique and fun experience.  Don't hesitate to try this amazing restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great experience! There is nothing quite like it, also a great first date idea because you aren't able to comment on your surroundings so you have to dig deep and end up having some really good conversations away from reality.

Also a very eye opening experience, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

We decided to get a total surprise and TO our surprise the food was some of the best I've had. Our surprise starter turned out to be a salmon (or perhaps tuna) tartar. Delicious. Our main course was a gourmet poutine and they didn't need to explain why it was gourmet. I nearly licked the plate.

I would recommend O'Noir again and again. Great food, great experience!"}
{"text":"J'ai vécu l'expérience O'Noir ce soir pour souper. Mes amis et moi, nous avons été accueilli par le sympathique personnel du restaurant qui nous a guidé à travers le menu, certes restreint, mais très satisfaisant. 

Nos choix faits, nous avons été guidés à la queue-leu-leu jusqu'à notre table dans la noirceur absolue par notre serveuse aveugle. Pas un seul instant ma confiance envers elle n'a été ébranlée. Elle se déplaçait avec aisance et confiance en nous guidant. 

Une fois assis, l'épreuve du pain a pu débuter. Trouver un contenant de beurre, en prendre une partie avec son couteau, l'étendre sur le pain, sans en faire tomber, il s'agit là d'une activité qui teste l'équilibre, la dextérité et la sensibilité aérospatiale. C'est aussi la première rencontre avec l'expérience d'un repas aveugle. 

Après le pain, les entrées. Comme je n'en avais pas pris, je passerai rapidement sur le sujet, mentionnant seulement que le choix et la qualité de celles-ci étaient on ne peu plus respectables. 

Après que les entrées soient choses du passé, le plat principal est arrivé. Autant c'est la qualité de la nourriture qui me pousse à donner une note généreuse, autant c'est la quantité de celle-ci qui me fait la descendre. Le repas était délicieux mais la quantité insuffisante. 

Pourquoi ne pas terminer par un délicieux choix de dessert (vous seriez fous de vous en priver). La mousse au chocolat noir et framboise était suffisamment délicieuse pour faire damner un saint. 

Une fois le repas terminé, c'est le retour en queue-leu-leu pour le retour à la sortie. L'addition, salée ne le cachons pas, payée, nous sommes sortis, forts heureux de notre expérience. 

Les points forts:

{"text":"I can't wait to go back! I'm sure you're all familiar with the concept by now: you eat in complete darkness and your served by blind waiters.

K to be honest, when I first heard of the place and found out you eat in the dark, I pictured dark but like when you're at home and can still see shadows and outlines...ya... that's not the case. I put my hand about 3 inches from my face (not that I would kno) and couldn't see it.

After you order from the room with lights, you get led in to the dark dinner hall by your waiter who introduces himself. At the table, you can hear people talking all around you. I got sat side by side with my guest and we actually had to feel accross to the other side of the table because we weren't sure if there were people at our table facing us. 

The waiters guide you through what's on your table and how it's arranged. When they bring you your food, they touch the side of the plate to your shoulder so that you know where it is, before they place it on the table. Off the record... I was startled when he called my name. I had no idea someone was behind me.

The food was probably one of the best meals I've ever had. I wasn't adventurous enough to try the surprise meal but my guest tried the surprise dessert and on that night it was a chocolate mousse, I believe.

There is one night a week when they have jazz band playing, I believe it's on sundays, which only adds to the atmosphere.

I just have to say how impressive it is that they are able to serve food and run the restaurant in the pitch black.

Just a tip though, if you're the type to stay in the washroom for a while, I suggest going before. Since you can't walk to or from the bathroom alone (you can't see... remember) your waiter has to wait near the door the entire time."}
{"text":"Came here for vaca. LOVE MONTREAL! We flew in and were starving. We Yelped for dinner places around Saint-Catherine, since that's where we were staying. This place came up. Not really knowing anything about the resturant, besides the name, we decided to walk over and see what is was all about. When we walked in the lady asked us if we had reservations, we told her no. So she said, let me see what I can do. Within 10 mins, she said are we ready. She advised us we had to put our stuff in the locker and order up front. She handed us a menu and every thing looked so delicious. I got a little nervous expecting what we were going to walk into. 
Our waiter walked in w/sunglasses and asked us to hold on to his shoulder, we walked in and HOLY gosh! It was PITCH DARK! We followed him, which seemed like FOREVER, I asked to use the restroom, so we had to take a little detour. The restroom was lightly dim but able to see yourself. The waiter waited for us and lead us to our table. He explained where everything was on our table and told us our food will be coming out shortly. 

THE FOOD! The experience was a one in a million. I can't tell you how our food looked like but the taste was fantastic! I had the steak, which was already cut up for you and the veggies were amazing. 

This is worth the experience. Also Saint-Catherine is a happening street!"}
{"text":"The main selling point of this restaurant is obvious the experience. 

You put in your order and check in your coats in the first room. (There's a dinner option where you can pick a mystery meal so that you can try to figure it out). 

You get led into the pitch black dining room by a blind waiter (Yes, they're actually blind - and the one we got was really really muscular and kind of good looking). You sit down and you await your food.

First you'll notice that you're actually seated quite far away from the people you came with. Secondly, the utensils, plates, and cups are big and heavy. This is all so that you don't spill your food of course. 

The room is quite noisy and echoy with everyone talking and it's a bit chilly. Your eyes will start to hurt because you'll keep opening them and will see nothing but a strange faint light in the distance. 

The food was good, I got the mystery dessert and it was incredibly easy to tell that it was creme brulee. 

Overall a good experience, I think it was something I'd do once just to do it, and then again to bring relatives/friends/people visiting from out of town to."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for a date night on a Groupon. It was a fantastic experience. The service was great. The food was excellent and the experience was unlike any other. 

Our waiter was a guy named Rodrigo. He was super nice and helpful and helped guide us through our entire meal. He had jokes, which made for a an even better night. At the end of the meal, he sat at our table and talked with us about what we had eaten, the flavours we had tasted and the experience as a whole. Great guy.

The reviews I had read on Yelp before booking our reservation had me skeptical about about the food. So many people had written that it was just OK. I disagree. Everything we had was flavourful and left me wanting more - from our appetizers to our amazing deserts. 

The experience was wild. It was quite noisy inside but I enjoyed it. It was pitch black inside the dining room. It may sound ridiculous to say this but I didn't expect it to be so dark. I thought at some point my eyes would adjust and I'd be able to see a little - but no. Pitch black the entire time. I think most of my conversation with my husband focused on how amazingly dark it was. 

I absolutely plan to take friends and family there who visit us here in Montreal. 

If you're looking for something novel to do in the city and want a great meal, DEFINITELY check out O'Noir."}
{"text":"Clever concept; however, a little disappointing when it comes to vegetarian food. I've been there three times and every time I feel the food is not on par with what's expected from a restaurant that charges you this much money to eat. Also, watch out because it gets very loud and sometimes it becomes hard to hear the person sitting in front of you, let alone the person sitting diagonale to you."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the most memorable dining experience I've EVER had. If not the most. 

The concept is simple. You're trying to experience life as a visually impaired person, albeit only for a short few hours and in a controlled environment.  The main dining room is completely dark - not dark as in \"your bedroom when you turn off the lights to sleep\" dark, but dark as in \"your eyes never adjust, you can't even see your fingers when you hold them up right in front of your eyes!\" dark.  

You decide your two or three-course meal in advance ($34 and $41 respectively) in a separate room, where you are also led back to at the end to settle the bill.  The selection was bigger than I imagined for a prix fixe menu, including a moderate drink list.   Each course also includes a \"surprise\" dish which I highly recommend to broaden your experience. You're then led into the pitch-black dining room by placing your left hand on your waiter's shoulder and forming a train with your fellow tablemates. The rest of the dinner continues in this tactile manner - the waiter places your hand on the chair you are to be seated, the waiter passes and collects your plates by brushing them over your shoulder, etc. 

It's true what they say about other senses being heightened when you lose one. But it may surprise you that they can also betray you - such as voices sounding closer or farther than they really are or your taste buds tricking you to think you're eating something you're not. For example, without giving away too much about the surprise dishes, we incorrectly thought the beef tartar was salmon, which the waiter said was a common observation (er no pun intended).  And I swear there was liqueur in the dessert as I was devouring it, but it didn't. I guess it was wishful thinking. 

You'll find yourself having trouble cutting up some of the food or determining if you've finished everything on your plate; but don't forget that these are just minor challenges a blind person has to deal with everyday. All was going well for me until near the end of the dinner, when I decided to try something from the person sitting across from me.  I knocked over my glass of water because I had forgotten it was there! I knew it was the right decision not to order red wine that night. 

We had intended to visit the Toronto location but due to a scheduling conflict, we ended up at the Montreal location and I'm so glad we did. This location has higher reviews due to the calibre of the food, such that the experience was more than just a novelty. And I can attest to this - the food was delicious and I would visit again. 

Definitely an insightful (pun intended this time) and exhilarating experience you have to try at least once. 

Food: 4*
Ambiance: ????
Service: 5* (The waiter was very attentive and came around to check on us often.. but I guess he had to be given the scenario!)
Value: 4* (I struggled with this one. $41 is steep for what you get.  But then again, it's an experience you can't get anywhere else.)"}
{"text":"O.Noir provides one of the most unusual dining experiences you will ever have, unless you're sight-impaired. In that case, it's just a great place to eat.

Patrons select courses from a set of choices, or one choice that is made--if you will excuse the expression--blindly.  

Once patrons place their orders in the front lobby, they are led to you table by a steady hand on the shoulder and seated.  Food and drink are presented with a gentle tap on the shoulder and handed over carefully.  The experience becomes very tactile, especially when you realize that to rely on cutlery for finding food on the plate will mean quite a bit will be left behind.

IN my specific case the salad was the most difficult to navigate, and not particularly remarkable.  The steak and lamb shank were delicious, but watch that bowl full of jus under the shanks.  I dropped a piece and spent the rest of the meal certain that my whole front was splattered. (It wasn't).  

I went for the surprise for dessert, which was pretty readily identifiable as a fruit and custard tart.  

An unexpected aspect of the experience is the amount of mental energy expended trying to figure out the shape of the room and who those noisy people on the other side were.  (We asked the waiter, at meal's end, and he answered rectangular, and McGill students, respectively).

Everyone should do this, at least once!"}
{"text":"Really the food is only OK (maybe 2-2.5 stars), but I will bump it up to 3 because the experience was so.... unique.  

The place is owned by blind people (and our waiter was blind).  You place your order in the front room, and then you proceed hand-to-shoulder to follow the waiter to the inner dining room where it is pitch black.  And this is no exaggeration... you can not see anything.  It is like sight-sensory deprivation.   The waiter will bring glasses and dishes up to your shoulder and you have to arrange them in some way that you are comfortable groping for.  

I had the avocado salad, and some shrimp/rice dish.  Both of these were decent/fresh.  The chocolate cake dessert was cold and hard, like something you'd buy in a freezer box at a grocery store.

It is damn hard to eat chunks of avocado with a fork in the dark.  It definitely gives you a minute appreciate of what a blind person's life must be like."}
{"text":"This was difficult to rate.  It is a very cool experience, however not romantic/charming as it is VERY loud.  It could have been so much better if the quality of food was even mediocre, but the food feel very short.  How can you have such a great concept and serve crap for food?  I guess the idea is to be affordable to get more folks to try but offer great food for us foodies and you would have won be over in every city where there is a location.  Skip this experience and select a location for better food and a great view."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés à ce restaurant à 2. La réservation est de mise le samedi soir ! 
L'entrée est une salle avec un bar et des vestiaires. On vous demande de choisir l'entrée, le plat et le dessert avant d'entrer ensuite dans la salle principale dans la complète obscurité et noirceur ! Vous devrez suivre votre serveur aveugle pour vous rendre à votre table.
On se rend compte que de ne rien voir est très troublant au début. Un peu de panique mais on s'habitue. A déconseiller pour les claustrophobes !
La nourriture servie est de bonne qualité.
Nous conseillons de manger avec les doigts, ce sera plus pratique !!
Un endroit pour discuter et partager dans le noir."}
{"text":"A very interesting experience.  I was not  sure what to expect.  First you're guided to your table by a waiter and it is completely dark. This forces you to focus on your senses. They offer surprise appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I chose a surprise appetizer and it was very good. I won't ruin the surprise so you will have to find it.  My entree was Filet mignon and was excellent. It was nice to just speak to my wife and not look at my phone every few minutes.  The only issue was the restroom. My wife had to go an we waited awhile to be guided there. There was also a table of young kids who were loud and obnoxious. They showed up at the end of our meal so it did not completely ruin the experience. I highly recommend, and would go again."}
{"text":"Some of the best slow cooked food I've had in this city. By no fault of the owners, the only negative are sometimes loud customers around you. For some reason, some people think you need to be louder when it's darker. Besides that it's a fun experience. Service and staff are polite and attentive. Our service was great. Prices are so-so for what you get."}
{"text":"Onoir is an absolutely incredible experience that I can't recommend enough.  When just walking to the table takes a leap of faith (since you don't and can't know what's ahead of you besides your waiter's shoulder), you know that the dining experience will change how you see the world.  At Onoir you can spend two hours imagining what it would be like to be blind if the world were perfectly catered to the blind (sticky placemats, people telling you exactly where things are all the time, smaller tables so you don't have to grope around for the bread), and then walk back into the world and re-appreciate your eyes.

I second the suggestion to come with people you can have a conversation with, as long pauses and no physical contact can elicit feelings of claustrophobia, fear, etc. in addition to the usual sad effects of a boring dinner date.    

But  

The food isn't that great.  All four of us got the surprise appetizer, entree, and dessert, and while trying to figure out your food is fun, eating good and inventive food is more fun.  Our appetizer was a large cheese ravioli in a simple tomato sauce, our entree was some kind of meat (we argue over pork, veal, chicken) in marsala sauce with roasted vegetables, and dessert was a chocolate mousse cake.  It was all solid food, but not very exciting.  Also the portions were quite large.

I'd suggest ordering off the menu and only ordering two rather than three courses.  

Is the experience amazing?  Yes, yes, and yes.  Is the food good?  Sort of.  Would I come back?  I don't really think so.

Go for the novelty of it, go for the experience, go to give money to a worthy charity (some of their profits go to help blind people, while they employ a group of people that has a 70% unemployment rate), but don't go for the food."}
{"text":"This place really deserves a 4.75/5; it is a truly unique experience that anyone visiting Montreal should endeavor to have. 

Decor/Ambiance- 0/5-1million/5
- This restaurant is staffed by blind waiters, and features a truly pitch-black experience. The staff will guide you, in single file train-like manner. inside the restaurant to your table. When I say pitch-black, I mean pitch black. Some might experience discomfort or disorientation at first, but it really is awesome. No one, except the staff who aren't blind, knows what the inside of the restaurant looks like. And that is its charm.

Food- 4/5
- Honestly I don't remember any of the food I ate, except for this fish, which tasted a bit too \"fishy.\" But I opted for the surprise course, which gives the chefs freedom to make whatever they want for you. Couple this with the darkness all around, this is a treat. I liked almost everything (save for the aforementioned fishy fish).

Service- 5/5
- Our waiter had good comedic timing, came promptly when we called for him, and overall was helpful. 

Bottom line- Would love to come again. Definitely go for the awesome experience."}
{"text":"Great experience. Depending what you choose it is easy to eat with a fork but if you take the hen I am sorry to say you will need to eat with your hands."}
{"text":"This was literally like riding a roller coaster but in a restaurant. First off, my one complaint is the hostess wouldn't say if she liked my shirt. You know? I was like \"Do you like the colour of this shirt?\". She wouldn't tell me if if she liked how my shirt looked. Maybe it is a weird shirt?

The one thing I would say is the dining area was kind of dark. I know some people like it like that and I don't want it really bright or anything. It just made it hard to see. Oh well, such is life. When in Rome...

Literally the minute you are in the dark for a while your other senses get way better. That's because you can't see. It makes your other senses become insanely stronger. I could smell my plate when I put it up to my face. I could even hear the other diners.

I didn't eat because I have stomach cancer."}
{"text":"WOW- such a unique and great dining experience!!!!!  You order you food and drink in the lobby and then your escorted to you table by your waiter - who happens to be BLIND.  Thus you eat your entire meal in the DARK!!!!!!!

It is amazing how we all take out sight for granted, and for a long dinner experience I was able to put my self in the shoes of the blind.  For the first time I was able to identify my shrimp risotto meal by the smell.  And the 2 other people I ate with- we realized that we had to be very clear with our verbal communication because we were no longer able to use our sight to read some ones body language etc.......

The food was excellent as well so it truly isn't just some gimmick to try to get the business.  It is the REAL thing and if anyone is visiting Montreal I recommend this amazing dining experience to ALL!!!!!!!!!  Call to make reservations 1st- as they only have 2 seating times for dinner 6pm & 9pm.

ENJOY :)"}
{"text":"This place was one of the best dates I have ever had! The food was a tad expensive but some of the costs go to a good cause anyways so it was worth it.The quality of the food was very good, I have had better before but anyone is still sure to like the food here. :) This place is always worth going to at least once.

 I would give it a 4.5/5"}
{"text":"O.Noir gave me a heightened respect for blind people who go out in public with just a cane.

And, as my wife mentioned, it gives new meaning to the idea of trust.

We had reservations for dinner and when we walked in, the front waiting/ordering area was jam-packed.  We found out that half the wait staff (who are all blind, btw) were out and so there were only two waiters for everyone.  So, we waited a little while.  This gave us time to put our stuff into a locker and check out the menu.

When it was finally our time to be seated, we got really excited/nervous/anxious.  Our server, Guillaume, was very nice and explained to us (in excellent English) how we were to enter the dining room.  We walked in with our hands on each other's shoulders like a people train.  Now, I knew this place was going to be dark.  What really shocked me was how dark it was - it was darker than any place i had ever been to before.  Pitch-black, as in cannot-see-your-hand-in-front-of-your-face black.  It was so black that closing my eyes offered a respite from the black.  We walked past tables full of people, but we had no idea how big the room was, how many tables there were, and how many people there were.  Seemed like a lot of people.  

After (very carefully) being seated, we acquainted ourselves with our plates and silverware, and then just sat in stunned disbelief for a few moments.  I'll admit, I became very anxious.  My body was trying to fight this sensation and I began to sweat a little.  But once you're there a few minutes you realize that probably everyone else in the room seems to be having a good time, so there's no reason to panic.  Eventually we got our appetizers.  I ordered the beet salad and it was delicious.  I ditched the fork after the first couple tries because I couldn't see where I was stabbing.  Plus, it was dark, so who cares if I eat like an animal?

Main course - steak.  Awesome steak.  It was cut up already to avoid any cutting-related damages (elbow knocking a glass over, etc).  This really made it easy to eat with my hands.  The food is not secondary to the \"gimmick\" as it might be at other \"gimmicky\" restaurants.  But, I'm not sure the food would have tasted any differently if the lights were on.  

When it was our turn to depart the room, Guillaume led us toward the main entrance area where the light was our enemy and where reality greeted us.  One of the organizers apologized for the waits, but we had no problems with the delays.  Would we return?  Absolutely.  Definitely a place to bring your friends or co-workers (if you're in the area)."}
{"text":"A view you must experience for yourself! Eating in total darkness is an incredible unique concept and it helps that the food is very good. If you find yourself in Montreal, you won't regret giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Alors pour mon anniversaire, j'ai décidé de m'offrir une expérience avec mes amis et maman. J'ai fait mes réservations pour le restaurant ONOIR il y a environ 6 semaines car tu en as besoin pour les fin de semaine et aussi, mon anniversaire tombant dan le temps de fêtes, disons que j'ai appris ma leçon au fil des ans.

Le personnel est très sympatique. De la personne qui prend les réservations au personnel sur place, tu te sens la bienvenue.

La nourriture était bonne et un bon choix pour les végétariens.

L'expérience a été très intéressante et variée de personne en personne. Pour ceux qui ne savent pas ce qu'est ONOIR, c'est un restaurant où tu manges dans le noir et est servi par des serveurs aveugles.

Premièrement, il est vrai ce qu'ils disent sur leur site web. Si vous désirez une soirée romantique, n'y allez pas un vendredi ou samedi car c'est très bruyant et ce pour deux raisons:
1-La fin de semaine étant totalement bouquée, les gens parlent fort et rient beaucoup
2-Les serveurs crient souvent \"attention\" afin de ne pas causer d'accident. Leur façon de s'orienter dans cette foule.

Pour moi, le bruit n'a pas été un facteur agaçant. Mais je ne suggérais pas d'y aller plsu que 4 à la fois, car une gros groupe serait difficile à gérer en terme de conversation.

Maintenant, le facteur de la noirceur. Très intéressant de mon côté. Je me suis retrouvée à fermer les yeux la plupart du temps et j'étais la seule dans mon groupe à le faire. De plus, ma posture a pris un coup. Incertaine si c'est dû au fait que j'essayais d'être attentive aux conversations et me penchais vers l'avant pour ce. J'ai eu un petit moment de panique au début et un de mes amis aussi, mais tu t'habitues vite à cette noirceur totale.

Manger dans le noir fût aussi très intéressant. L'odorat est le sens qui a té prédominant. Trouver la nourriture était drôle et dieu merci, il n'y avait pas de caméras pour nous filmer. J'ai mangé mes calmars à la main et mon plat principal avec fourchette mais j'ai utilisé mes doigts une fois de temps en temps.

En quelques mots c'est une expérience  à vivre. Et je ne souhaite que du succès continue à ce petit resto sympa!


___

So for my birthday, I decided to try an experience with friends and mom. I booked ONoir about 6 weeks ago, knowing you need reservations for week-ends and with years of experience, my birthday falling into x-mas parties, I don't take chances anymore!

The staff is extremely friendly, from the reservationist to the staff, you feel welcomed at ONOIR.

The food was quite good and good choices for vegetarians. 

The experience was very interesting and everyone experienced it different. Ok a quick note for those who have no clue what Onoir is about. you eat in complete darkness and you are served by blind waiters. 

First, it is true what they say on their website. If you expect a romantic evening, do not go there on a friday or saturday as the place is extremely noisy for 2 reasons: 
1-It is fully booked and people being excited talk and laugh a lot
2-The waiters use their voices a lot in order to avoid accidents so you constantly hear \"attention!\".

Personally, the noise did not bother me at all. I would suggest you do not go more than 4 people. i feel a bigger group would have been crazy to handle conversation wise.

Now the dark factor. Quite interesting on my side. I found myself closing my eyes almost the entire time. I was the only one doing so in my group. My posture took a beat too. Unsure if because I was trying to be very attentive to what was said around the table and therefore I was bending forward to hear well. I had a little moment of panic at the beginning, feeling claustrophobic. One of my friend admitted he had it too. But then, you get used to total darkness easily. 

Eating in the dark is quite interesting. The smell was much more evident to us all than usual. Finding food was interesting and thank god there were no cameras filming. I ate my appetizer with my fingers (Calamari) and tried my best to use my fork without my fingers for my main dish (veggies and some kind of veggie patty).

In few words, it is an experience to go for. And I only wish them a continuous success!"}
{"text":"Si c'était à refaire une première fois, je recommencerais sans hésiter, mais je ne crois pas y retourner une seconde fois. Laissez moi m'expliquer. Oui c'était cher (près de 150$ pour deux personnes, avec le tip et deux verres de vins), mais pour l'expérience en tant que telle, ça vaut la peine. C'est impressionnant de se laisser guider au travers de la salle par notre serveur non-voyant, et c'est amusant d'essayer de deviner ce qu'il y a dans notre assiette, même quand on sait ce qu'on a commandé! Par contre la nourriture était très moyenne, c'était mon gros point faible de la soirée. J'y retournerais peut-être si c'était pour y aller avec un groupe d'amis (J'y suis allée pour une \"date\" la première fois), mais sinon, je préfère garder mon argent pour un autre restaurant!"}
{"text":"5 stars because of the experience, not so much the food.

When you arrive at the restaurant, you are asked to remove your coat and bag so as to leave anything behind that might produce light. They have lockers so I didn't feel as apprehensive about leaving my purse behind. You place your order at the counter- you can choose from a two course meal for $35, or a 3 course meal for $40. There is only one vegetarian option, which is really limiting. 

Once you've placed your order, you're lead into another room by a blind waiter or waitress. It's pitch black and I kept worrying I would bump into a table or chair, but it went fine. I only had difficulty pulling out my chair to sit down and trying to figure out if we were by a wall, but I was able to get a sense of this after a few minutes.  There seemed to be some plastic grips on the table so nothing would slide around. 

When you receive your meal, you are told if the plate is on your right or left shoulder so you can find it. It was interesting trying to eat the meal, which was polenta nuggets with cheese, with a side of vegetables. The food wasn't bad, but I never knew how much food was on my plate. Eating the food wasn't as difficult as I thought, but there certainly were a few times where I thought I had managed to get some food on the fork, only to find out when there was none. That was pretty amusing. Dessert was a fruit sorbet, which was alright. 

It gets really loud in the restaurant with all the conversation, and a few times I think I saw some light- some people may have brought their cell phones in their pockets. A family beside me was producing sparks of light because they were rubbing the fabric of their clothes together to create static electricity, which was pretty interesting.

When you step out of the restaurant it feels a bit strange, having been surrounded by darkness for a bit. The staff was friendly, food was ok, experience memorable."}
{"text":"This is all about the experience.  After ordering at the counter (you can mix and match surprise courses with regular ones btw) you are led by your waiter into the pitch black dining room.  We had a table next to the wall...not sure how much harder it is if you are in the middle of the dining room.  Please note--SPOILERS AHEAD.

I had the aubergine caviar to start, vegetable croquettes and surprise dessert.  Vicki went surprise all around which turned out to be beef tartare and pork croquettes.  You definitely needed your napkin as your hands became a key tool both for location of the food and nature.  

The dessert was a yogurt and mint pudding that was okay.  I liked my starter and main but vicki was less happy with hers.  Again, its not about the food here.

We had a bottle of the pfaffenheim pinot gris which was relatively sweet but a good pair with the spicier croquettes.

It was very enlightening (no pun intended) to experience dining this way and while I wouldnt put it back into the rotation it would be fun with a group."}
{"text":"I must say that I was intrigued with the concept of the restaurant.  I was in Montreal and had to try this out.  
The experience was unique, but the food was just ok.  I went with the surprise menu, just to test my palette.

The first course was escargot.
The second course was a pasta dish with salmon.  And it was canned salmon. Or at least it tasted like the canned salmon that my grandmother use to love eating.  I distinctly remember the taste of the  bones in the salmon. The salmon is cooked in the can and the bones are soft and can be eaten. And for some reason, I kind of liked eating the salmon bones.
So the good news is that it brought back some happy memories of having dinner with grandma. 
But the bad news is that I got served half a can of salmon with pasta from a box in a restaurant. 
The third course was the chocolate mousse. It was ok.

Come for the experience of eating in complete darkness, not the food."}
{"text":"Just ate here last week, and it was an amazing experience.  The darkness is so complete and total- it is disorienting and exhilarating at the same time.  I recommend ordering the \"surprise\" dish- eating mystery food is something that you can't really do anywhere else."}
{"text":"Ok.  My fiancé and I consider ourselves pretty open to new things and ideas, but this place was too much.  First off, everyone needs to understand (and the greeters do NOT explain this at all) is that \"eating in the dark\" - means eating in the pitch black - no light of any kind, you can't see you nose in front of you.  There is no option to even have a small candle should you feel uneasy or uncomfortable or want to see what you are being served - and that is a big part of the problem with this place.  Understand this completely before you walk in the door.

We ended up offering our apologies and leaving for two reasons.  First, we were just not comfortable with the absolute darkness.  Much of the experience of eating good food is being able to see it and we both got the sense that everything around us, on our table and served to us, was cheap.  The calamari I ordered as an appetizer was not cooked, which I considered very unusual.  The drink I ordered didn't seem to have anything in it.  

But the last straw was when my fiancé received her \"surprise\" appetizer - which turned out to be a very bad smelling steak tartar(?)  While they ask you if you have any food allergies, I believe it reasonable to expect that your food will be cooked and you will not be served raw uncooked meat with a raw uncooked egg as a \"surprise.\"  That was it for us, and we politely asked to leave and did.

Service was \"ok\" - but there were comments our waiter made that bordered on rude.

This pretty much ruined what should have a nice dinner out and we tried another place and recovered the evening nicely there - at a place where we could see what we were buying and eating and could enjoy a dining experience.  This place, just does not offer this - certainly not at the prices they ask."}
{"text":"This was one of the coolest dining experiences I've ever had. I won't go into detail about it since many other people on Yelp already have. Besides, I went in knowing pretty much nothing and I really loved the surprise. My only tips are not to be in a rush, to be open-minded and to be prepared to spend a bit of money, though it's really not too expensive. They did have a vegetarian option and you can tell them if you're allergic to anything. The surprise course is also a fun thing to try."}
{"text":"What an incredibly memorable dining experience. This is the kind of place you'll go to once and then tell people about it over and over again because it was so unique.

I think the entire concept is beautiful. O.Noir hires people who are legally blind, a portion of the proceeds go to an NPO that helps the legally blind find work, and you spend the entire evening in a completely pitch black environment -- you literally see NOTHING, which is such an unusual experience for those of us who are used to visually absorbing the food and atmosphere around us. But they say when one of your senses is removed, the others are heightened, which is exactly how I felt here at O.Noir. Taste, smell, hearing, feeling... all those things became so much more important than I knew.  

We called ahead to make sure we could eat a gluten free meal, which they were easily able to accommodate. Then we ordered the 3 course surprise dinner, so we were served and then able to guess what we were eating afterwards. We started with a tuna tartare salad (amazing textures), then duck confit with potatoes and apple (the duck was incredibly rich and buttery), and ended with a fabulous creme brulee. All of the food had beautiful, strong aromas and a wonderful variance in textures.

More than once I put my fork to my mouth and there was nothing on my fork. HAHaha. I mean, it's soooo dark. Your eyes will NOT adjust to the light because there is none, and you have to put your phone in a locker before you enter the dining room, which your server will lead you to. If you have to use the restroom, call out for your waiter! There is the tiniest, dimmest light ever in the bathroom, but other than that -- complete darkness. I almost felt dizzy until I got used to being in the pitch black and grew more comfortable with all the sounds around me. 

Don't worry, you get to order your drinks and food in the bar area before you enter the noir-est dining room ever!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try this place out but it was fully booked out. He went in and pleaded our case and they got us a reservation for the following night- New Year's Eve so I have to say I was very appreciative of that.

He chose mystery everything but I chose my entrée (steak). Because we both chose mystery apps and desserts, they brought us out separate things. 

The dining experience was not a gimmick or anything. From where we were sitting, we could not see any lights except when my hubby unfolded his napkin and there was green static electricity. We were at a table by ourselves so it was nice to just be able to chat without any distractions. The food was actually quite good and for the price we paid for 3 course meal & two glasses of champagne and a favorable exchange rate, it was quite reasonable. Yes it would be fun to have an exotic cuisine night and really have to guess at what you were eating but overall, it was a very great experience."}
{"text":"Eating in the dark was a great experience. 
The service was great from start to finish. 
The food was decent, I think in general food tastes better in the dark. 
I had the steak and it seemed to be cooked medium rare the way I asked and tasted good. 
My date had the rack of lamb, her dish was not as tasty. It was too salty and lacked flavour. 
Overall I would definitely recommend it as a one time experience."}
{"text":"Il y a longtemps que je voulais essayer ce restaurant. Pour mon anniversaire c'était l'occasion rêvée. Malheureusement, il m'est impossible de donner une meilleure note. Pour l'expérience, c'est définitivement 5 étoiles, pour l'ambiance 2 étoiles et la bouffe 2 étoiles aussi. Un peu sévère, je ne crois pas. 

Premièrement, le repas. Une cuisine sans goût, souvent à la mauvaise température. Tel que les champignons sauvages et fromages féta, qui avait un goût de réfrigérateur et avait la température de ceux qui y sortes à peine. La viande pareille avec un goût de réchauffé. Pour un restaurant, à Montréal, qui se dit offrir une expérience gastronomique, c'est très décevant. Une revue du menu et des méthodes de préservation serait à revoir. 

Deuxièmement, le bruit. Lors de ma visite, il y avait tellement de bruit que l'on devait toujours répéter. À la longue, c'est difficile, on finit par ne plus parler. Selon le serveur, ce soir-là était un des moins bruyants. 

Troisièmement, l'expérience. Pour une expérience, c'est toute une expérience. N rien voir, rien du tout. Un moment donné, c'était mieux de simplement fermer les yeux, car ceux-ci essayent toujours de s'accrocher à quelque chose, c'est épuisant. Dommage que la nourriture n'était pas au rendez-vous. Au moins, cela aurait créé une distraction.


Conclusion, je recommande O.Noir pour l'expérience. Non recommandé pour les enfants. Aussi, un petit conseil, choisissez des plats simples qui ne contiennent pas d'os. C'est plus facile à couper lorsque l'on ne voit pas."}
{"text":"I have visited twice thanks to deal websites. You chose your food and drinks before you go in, but the place itself can be rather noisy with the small space and your hearing hightened. My eyes always dart around so I got a headache for the first 15-20 minutes on both occasions, if you have a night mask I would suggest bringing it. The food was great but I was a little disappointed with their service for my mother. She chose the \"surprise\" dishes which ended up being calamari appetizer and fried pork main. They should have known better than to serve her two deep fried dishes, it really ruined her experience which was quite disappointing.

Food:  8/10
Service:  6/10 - they need to think through what they're serving
Price:  7/10 - Worth trying, but maybe not coming back
Atmosphere: 7/10 - Interesting, but can back fire"}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a little hesitant to eat a meal in the complete darkness, and I really felt out of my element when the waitress led us through the pitch black restaurant to our table somewhere in the restaurant. But once the appetizers arrived I had lots of fun trying to figure out what was in front of me by the taste and feel of it (we ordered the \"surprise\" menu items, so we had no idea what would be served to us!). I don't think the food was particularly special, but the overall experience was very interesting.
My \"surprise\" meal turned out to be: escargot in garlic butter (appy), and linguini with cream sauce, salmon, and black pepper."}
{"text":"It is an interesting experience to try once, and only once. Not knowing what I was eating it a turn off.

FYI you also sit with people you don't know, and the conversations actually get weird, and lots of touchy feelly. I did not enjoy my dinner, nor my experience.  I left with a major headache. You would think with that a experience like this, people would shut up and experience it fully, but no.

Never again."}
{"text":"I absolutley loved the experience of this place. And i also really happened to love the food. I got a surprise appetizer, which turned out to be octopus. Super delicious. Everything was great. Our waiter was blind, and it was def interesting to get a taste of that kind of life. Really intense, almost to the point of anxiety towards the end of it. I really wanted light by the end of our meal. But i would recommend it.

Only thing i didn't like was location. It was right next door to a sketchy strip club, and when we went into the restaurant a weird dirty guy was standing infront of it telling us not to go in because the food wasnt good. Ew."}
{"text":"5 star amazing food and 5 star dining concept and execution. 

I wasn't prepared for how overwhelmingly dark it is. If you're hoping your eyes will adjust, they will not. If you're hoping that your other senses will compensate, it won't happen in the time elapsed of a single meal. I came in too cocky. I wasn't afraid of the dark! But I had my heart racing the whole time. I'm chic and cosmopolitan! But I probably made a total fool of myself fumbling with my utensils and spilling on myself. 

Dinner was a fantastic succulent crispy duck with glazed root vegetables. Super flavorful. Dessert was a delicate yogurt lemon panna cotta with a crumbled cookie topping. Truly a delight for the taste buds. I was shamelessly licking my plate.

A minor gripe: it can be a little difficult to get a hold of your waiter for the bill or more drinks, but they do a great job announcing themselves and are very timely with the food.

Also I'm absolutely dying to know what the place looks like with the lights on!"}
{"text":"Now this was an amazing experience. At Onoir you receive some decent food you also receive the experience of being blind. No, they don't blindfold you or put goggles on you. They have you eat in total darkness. By total darkness, I mean there is no lights at all including no watched, cell phone or any other devices that may deliver even the smallest amount of light. 

The restaurant is open two time a day everyday. You have to make reservation for one of the two times. When you walk in, they give you a menu and have you order your food there but pay later. They also have you use the free lockable lockers to have you leave all light making devices. After ordering, your waiter, who is truly blind escort you to you table. He/she leads you through two doors into a pitch black room where the dinner tables are located. He/she has to take your hand and put it on the chair for you to even find the chair. I won't go into anymore details as one needs to experience it for ones self. 

All of the waiting staff is blind and since the room is totally dark, if you need to use the restroom or need any type of assistance, then you only have to shout for your waiter. 

As far as the food, one of the choices and the one I recommend is the Surprise Dish and Dessert. When they bring it to you, you must use your senses to discover what you ate. They will not tell you. Mine was pork, potatoes, mushrooms and green beans. The dessert was a mouth watering chocolate moose. It was amazing. The price was about 30 dollars per person, food only. 

If you are in Montreal then you must check this place out. They give blind people jobs and donate money to an organization for the blind."}
{"text":"Having been to O'noir several times, I thoroughly enjoy the experience and bringing people along!

The food is decent, nothing exceptionally fancy of difficult, but it is fun doing it in complete darkness.  I've heard of other places that just give you blindfolds, but I really like that you have no choice but total darkness here.

Not sure why they don't serve \"Darkness friendly\" food that is easier to eat than pasta or meat and potatoes, but that adds to the difficulty I guess.

Long story short, go to eat in total darkness, try the surprises, have fun."}
{"text":"By now you know you eat in complete darkness.
It's a seriously cool experience but due to the combination of very poor acoustics and your heightened sense of hearing, the place is - WAY too loud. Been there 3 times. Each time way too loud, to the point where it affected my enjoyment of the experience. Food was slightly above average but that may be because taste itself is highly accentuated in this experience. It wasn't OMG food is what I'm saying but very good. I'm giving 4 stars here but really it should get 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience.  The food was decent/good, but that was totally not the point anyway.  My daring husband got the surprise appetizer and surprise entree, and that was just about the best game we've ever played, trying to figure out what we were eating without any visual cues.  Then our delightful waiter quizzed us on each, which was really fun. I got a special appetizer and the filet mignon, both of which were fine/good, but again, they could have been fast food and it still would have been the best dining experience we've had in years.  Will definitely return any time we're in Montreal, and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience!"}
{"text":"I came here in April. I feel like dining here is more about the experience rather than the food, although the food wasn't bad. I ordered the vegetarian option (which was a pasta dish) although somehow I kept eating only arugula. 
One interesting part about dining here that I don't think anyone has yet mentioned: I couldn't see my dish so I couldn't visually comprehend how much food was left. I actually stopped eating when I was full! Yay!"}
{"text":"\" You don't need sight to experience bad service\"

A long weekend trip to Montreal with my friends in October, this place was highly recommended by one of my travel companion because of her previous visit to the city.  Completely excited/nervous of what to expect I think overall I was pretty disappointed by the management of this establishment.  I think my friends were even more upset and vocal about it for me.  

One of the dishes I decided to do a \"surprise\" for my appetizer and expressed to the hostess what I as allergic to.. \"shellfish, peanuts, tomatoes\".  During my dinner, I had received my plate and the first thing I picked up was a tomato, I thought maybe i could just push them aside and eat something else on the plate but each piece I push my fork onto, it would be a tomato. I though I was crazy and I was very sure it was a tomato,  so I had my friend try it and she said it was definitely a tomato. Told the waitress the situation and only hoped that by the end of my meal that the restaurant would take responsibility for mistaking the order.  When I came out to pay for my meal, nothing was said and I had to bring it up with the hostess.  She denied that it was impossible that my dish had tomatoes because my appetizer was a steak tar tar (let's be real, I know the difference between raw steak and a tomato). She said that the only way there would be a tomato is if a tomato fell in my dish (despite my whole plate filled with tomatoes).  After she brought the manager and he and both the hostess continued to tell me that there's no way I had that on my dish.  Then one of the hostess realized that maybe the waitress may have given me one of my friends appetizers and my friend didn't realize she was eating my appetizer.  Now that there was clarity, they changed my meal from a 3 course entry price to a 2 course entry price to \"compensate\", no apology, no responsibility. It's just disappointing how much they don't realize the severity of allergies, and what would of happened if I had to use my Epinephrine Pen to prevent anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction).  To top it off, the manager reprimanded his waitress in front of us, \"how professional.\"  

I have to give this restaurant 1 star because this restaurant may conceptually be a \"great idea\" but a lawsuit waiting to happen."}
{"text":"We were a party of three who dined here on a Tuesday night.  One member of our party began feeling uncomfortable in the dark so we finished our meal outdoors.  The concept behind this restaurant is that dining in the dark allows you to have a different sensory experience with food and drink than you would normally have in the daylight.  That might appeal to young college students and some artsy types, but it was mostly lost on us.  The food at O'Noir is quite delicious, but somewhat overpriced and not terribly creative compared to the tremendous variety of other choices in the local area."}
{"text":"Not only fun and unique, but food is delicious.
This could be considered one of those experiences you have to try once in your life, but I've actually been to this place 3 times in the past year. Coming with different people always makes for an original dinner.

Menu is seasonal and changes slightly, so make sure you check their website ahead of time to know what you will order. If you're feeling very adventurous, you can opt for the \"surprise\" dishes. It will only be revealed after you're done eating. You can choose either a 2 course or 3 course meal. 

I've had their avocado salad, filet mignon and creme brulee for dessert which was always superb. I like that your meat is already cut up for you. You will be provided with only a fork and spoon. No need to worry about conventions, it's perfectly okay to even eat with your hands as you may have a hard time figuring out where your food is on your plate!

Lots of laughter guaranteed. This place gets very loud.

If you need to go to the washroom, call for your waiter by name and he/she will guide you. There is dim lighting in the bathroom.

I highly recommend this concept of eating in the dark, it's gaining in popularity around the world and there's actually another Montreal restaurant with a copy cat name - although Onoir was here first ;)"}
{"text":"An acquaintance insisted we visit O.Noir during our trip to Montreal, so I made the reservation via email and was very quickly confirmed.  I was excited at the idea of experiencing food through restricted senses.

4 stars for the experience itself: The novelty of attempting to function normally in pitch darkness continued throughout the meal.  Our waiter was very attentive and friendly, nice job Guillame!  We dined on a Sunday night, which has live music (instrumental cover band) and despite the music on top of the noise from nearby tables, we were able to easily chat and hear each other (we were sat side by side).

2 stars for the food:  My friend ordered the eggplant starter, chicken in coriander sauce entree and surprise dessert (tiramisu).  I tried the first and it was very salty.  For my starter, I went for the watermelon and avocado with feta.  Sadly I let my friend stab her fork on my plate - she took the only piece of feta.  Probably a service to me, since the dish was seasoned only with salt.  Entree was very disappointing - as a vegetarian, I'm used to seeing this usual stand-by at bars and other low-end restaurants, but when I'm paying $25 for an entree, pasta with tomato sauce was a let down.  Yes, we're not a majority but it just shows a lack of creativity in the kitchen.  When promoting your restaurant on the basis of taste and smell alone, I'd expect something more.  Throw some of the coriander sauce on some mushrooms, at least.  My dessert, creme brulee, was standard, but in this case, the tastiest thing I ordered.

Worth doing for the experience, but don't expect the price to reflect good quality of food."}
{"text":"Most memorable restaurant experience I've ever had, bar none.

I almost freaked out and ran out of the place upon entering the pitch black dining room. I didn't want to ruin everyone's night so I forced myself to not let the \"not in control\" feelings get to me. It took a little while but we all calmed down in due time and by the end of the meal, most of us wanted to stay longer! We all felt so relaxed and at peace.

I disagree with the many reviewers who have called the food being subpar. I had a surprise entrée (which I couldn't identify) and the filet mignon. Both dishes were succulent and the warm bread was outstanding.

One of the best parts of the meal was our waiter, Tim, who was patient, attentive and incredibly warm. I came away from this experience very emotionally shaken up and had so many thoughts running through my head as to the limitations facing visually-impaired people like Tim. Huge props to O.Noir for hiring a population that has a 70% unemployment rate.

GO FOR IT!"}
{"text":"So my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and I decided to surprise him all the while praying he wouldn't bolt from the door when he realized we would be eating in complete darkness!!  We pulled up in a taxi and the driver said, \"I think they're closed\"!  LOL!  We walked in and the young lady in the front (that area is dimly lit) gave us a menu for us to pick out what we wanted and took our drink orders.  We were then led into the back by our server, Michael.  I put my hands on his shoulders (hubby put his hands on my shoulders) and in we went.  As soon as we went through the door it was PITCH black! You can't see your hand in front of your face.  Michael led us through the restaurant and guided us to our seats.  He NEVER missed a beat...didn't bump into anything at all.  It was AMAZING! 

For our meals, we had duck confit and a salmon and trout salad for appetizers, beef short ribs and orange ginger chicken for dinner.  Everything was very tasty.  My husbands short ribs melted like butter! It was VERY strange trying to eat in the dark.  We gave up on using forks and just used our fingers.  The darkness certainly enhances your other senses.  I could 'feel' when someone was standing or walking behind me which was a little creepy.  I was so impressed how the servers walk through the restaurant without bumping into each other.  They just say, \"Attencion\" as they move about to alert the others.  Oh and all of the wait staff is either blind or legally blind.

An UNFORGETTABLE and humbling experience.  Try it!  It's very different but something you'll be talking about for years to come!! 

P.S....They also had a live jazz band when we were there.  Nice touch!"}
{"text":"I have never had an experience like this in my life. I was completely blown away and can't stress enough how important it is for every foodie out there to give this a shot.  

First, we ordered just outside the restaurant area. Food and alcohol. Then, we waited for our waiter to arrive for only a min or two.  He showed up and he was obviously seeing impaired.  He escorted us through a series of curtains and we entered the dining room area.  Now... I was expecting a dim lit room that would force your other senses to be amplified and everything would be super tasty.  Dim.... Negative.  Pitch black!!  Couldnt see one inch in front my face.  We held onto the shoulder of the person in front of us and shuffled our way to our table.  

I don't want to tell you too much more because I don't want to ruin the experience as a whole.  Just trust me when I say the fun doesn't stop there... 

Service was perfect.  The food was superb.  We got the 3 course surprise.  We had no idea what he was serving us until we blindly dug in.  Awesome!!  I can't wait to go back again and try it when I know exactly what's coming.  So cool!

Enjoy!

{"text":"This was a very cool experience. Wine and food taste very different when your vision is cut out.
Despite the obnoxious group of teens, my date and I managed to have a good time. Our waiter, Mathias, deserves special mention as he was exceptionally courteous, helpful and generally pleasant.
The food was actually very good. Probably the best lamb shank I've ever grabbed and eaten caveman style!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and experience. Never realized each color of this universe was beautiful on its own."}
{"text":"Great novelty in downtown Montreal! The dining room is really dark (not completely, as the blinking lights for the smoke detectors, and the occasional lights wafting in from outside the dining area), and enough to unnerve some people (at least initially). The 'surprise' dishes are pleasant, but in addition to informing the intake attendants of any allergies, it's also prudent to let them know of food preferences (you could be served tartar for instance, but you may not be a fan of raw beef).
All this being said, the beef tartar was superb. Our server was very pleasant and very informative! (Thanks Tim!)
The cons: the intake staff seemed a bit confused, and both were either only dealing with incoming patrons or outgoing guests; no dedicated person to deal with both. This adds to confusion a lot more than is necessary, especially after the relatively pleasant dinner. The tiramisu eclair is terrible (the creme brûlée is much better). The service time is a bit lengthy, and it's a bit difficult to get attention of the servers (while they do ask you to just call their names out loud if you need anything, we found that this method consistently failed to get any attention whatsoever).
Overall, I would recommend a visit, at least once."}
{"text":"see how long everyone's response to this restaurant is? It's because the experience impacted them...good or bad, you are reading it all.
Dont read them! just go.

if you really want to read mine:
I went at 8.30pm and I'm glad I did because not many people were in the room at that point.  (lots of people showed up later, which wasn't as transcendental)
Pitch black. It felt like eating in outer space...but you can make up your own metaphors for the experience.
The food (I ordered the mystery dish) was quality, but keep in mind you are also paying for the experience.

For the main course I recommend ordering a mystery dish. Mine turned out quite nicely (but I wont tell you what it is because then you might expect it.. they do vary it up)

For dessert I recommend ordering what you want off the list and not the mystery dessert. That way you can finish the evening comfortably eating what you picked even though you can't see it.

I recommend reserving ahead of time. The staff is polite and the experience, to me, is something you should go for."}
{"text":"A unique experience and certainly worth seeking out for a special occasion.

It does take a few minutes to get used to the atmosphere, but by the first course you stop trying to see things and just concentrate on the food, the chatter around you, and your companions. The tables around us seemed to be filled with loud, celebratory groups, but O.Noir is also a good choice for a romantic occasion, assuming your date is into it. 

You would think they'd let the food slide, but no: It's first-rate and not gimmicky at all. We ordered from the menu before entering the dining room (there are \"surprise\" options for the more adventurous among us), and it was still a challenge to identify what was on our plates at any given time. This turned out to be tremendously entertaining, both because we really paid attention to each mouthful, and because sometimes we had to resort to eating with our hands.

(Don't worry, you won't be covered in food by the time you emerge. I was absolutely convinced we would embarrass ourselves, but we left looking none the worse for wear.)

The only issue was getting the attention of our server. He was absolutely wonderful: charming and soft-spoken. But there was a long period after dessert when we simply could not locate him. First, we called his name, then we chanted it, then we resorted to making up songs with his name in it. Nothing. After a while (How long? no idea.), he innocently turned up, asking how everything was.

This was not a big deal, but it made us realize that things can get strange at O.Noir. There is absolutely no way you can leave your table without the help of the waitstaff; don't even try it. So raise your voice if you need to. You won't be the only one."}
{"text":"This may have been a yolo moment, as I had no idea what to expect going in - the service was really great and I'm still surprised how the wait staff were so trained in taking us (a party of four girls) around the restaurant. I had the lamb, which tasted ok. It was a challenge eating properly in the dark so I ended up using my hands (oh well, no one could see me...)

Definitely a good experience that you can share for future stories."}
{"text":"Ever wondered what is it like to be blind? 

At O.Noir, you can because everybody dines in total darkness. When my friend suggested this place for dinner, I was intrigued by the idea. Then a stream of questions came to mind: How do I know what I am eating? How am I eating it if I can't see? How do I know where my table is? and most of all, how do I pee if I need to? I know they are silly concerns but it really got me thinking about living as a blind person and the challenges that they face everyday.

So we got there right on time for our reservation. You have to have one because they are only open twice a day, 7 days a week. We had to order our food at the front desk prior to going in. If you are brave enough, definitely consider ordering the surprise appetizer, entree, and dessert, which I did. You'll just have to use what your mama gave you - your imagination and your senses.

Then, our waiter came out to greet us, and tada - she's BLIND. Wait, what? How is she going to ... *insert more questions*? Yes, I know but we had absolute confidence in her. She escorted us to our table and the first thing we did was figuring our our personal space and bounderies, silverwares, etc. You would think that your eyes would get used to the darkness and you can see maybe like a shadow or something. Nope, it was still pitch black after 10 minutes.

It was very funny when we were passing the bread because you can't see the person and I could easily shove it at someone's face. The meal finally came and I think I figured it out. It was chicken with haricort vert, carrot and shallots. And for dessert, it was chocolate mousse with raspberry I think. If you're vegetarian, don't worry because they have vegetarian entrees too. *psst* Of course, if you want to lick the plate clean, you can because it's dark. I did.  =)

Overall, I'll give it a 3.8 stars for food but the experience was worth 5 stars. I highly recommend O.Noir because I am sure this will be an amazing experience for anybody."}
