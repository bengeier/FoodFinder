{"text":"I came here on Easter Monday for lunch with 3 others. I had a Groupon for two that I shared with a friend, and my other 2 friends used yelp check-in to get 15% off.

Here you order and pay, and they give you a number card. When they call your number, you go pick up your order. Simple. Our order took a little over 10mins to be made, which I found still acceptable for freshly cooked burgers.   

Our orders were:
- 2 x Sweet Sin - 4oz Beef Patty w/ Cheese, Bacon, Sauteed Onions & Secret Sauce on Original Buns ($7.99)
- The Special - 4oz Beef Patty w/ Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato & Secret Sauce on Golden Buns ($6.99)
- Buffalo Chicksin - Crispy Chicken Smothered in Buffalo Wing Sauce w/ Lettuce, Tomato & Ranch on Original Buns ($6.99)
- Sinner Fries - Fries w/ Seasoned Ground Beef, Nacho Cheese, Sour Cream & Diced Tomatoes ($6.29)

All of us happened to get burgers that came pre-dressed, so we didn't get to check out their toppings options. I had the Sweet Sin, and I really like the simple combination of items. And because it wasn't over-loaded with toppings like I tend to get when I'm given a choice to add my own toppings, I got to taste everything in the burger. The patty was juicy. The bacon was crisp, but not overly done and dried up. The onions were nice and caramelized, with the onion sweetness I loved. And their secret sauce went well with everything. The proportion of bread to topping, to patty was good. The bread was fluffy, but sturdy. For once I still actually had bread at the end of my burger. I don't like when the bread mysteriously disappears, and I'm left awkwardly with just patty, and some random toppings, during my last few bites. The Sinner Fries, we shared amongst the 4 of us. It was really good. Kind of like a Fries Supreme at Taco Bell, which I loved growing up, but with better fries, and much fresher ingredients. My other 2 friends said they liked their The Special and Buffalo Chicksin as well, didn't get to try it.

The burgers might be a bit small for some people. I found getting my own burger, and sharing the fries, was the perfect portion for me for lunch. For dinner I would need a little more. A lot of people seem to compare this place to Burger Priest. This place is a bit cheaper than BP, but the burgers are also smaller. The portion size of the Sinner Fries for the price was pretty good. Our total came out to ~$31 after tax (including the $12 I paid for the Groupon, and with the yelp discount), for 4 people. So it was a pretty good deal for us. I'd still probably come back even with just the yelp check-in discount.

The restaurant was pretty spacious, and they had a lot of seating compared to some of the other burger places I've been to. All my friends agreed that we liked Sinners Burger more than BP. I have no idea if we ordered the wrong items at BP, but it was very unmemorable to us. But they still like Five Guys better lol. I, myself quite like it here though. Unfortunately its a bit of a drive west for me, so I probably won't be back too often. But if I'm ever in the west end, and craving burgers, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Just noticed this place today so decided to pop in and give it a try.
I had a Special Burger with fries. The buttered bun was very messy with all the burger toppings - making this a good \"dirty burger\"! Nice fresh beef and yummy toppings!
The fries were very generously portioned and tasted great.
The service was fast and very friendly!
Definitely will be making a return trip!"}
{"text":"I tried their burger and fries here today. The beef is really good. Juicy, properly seasoned, and not overcooked. The bun is pillowy perfection. The toppings were fine, but they were a bit stingy with my pickle and onion. You might want to order \"extra\" toppings. 

I want to try their fake Big Mac next time.

The fries were handcut and had a decent flavour, but they were a bit limp. They need to let the fries crisp up a bit more on their second dunk into the oil. 

Much better than Burger's Priest!"}
{"text":"Really tasty burgers and fries. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Came here today (Tuesday, July 28 @ 3:15pmish) - not very busy at all and lots of parking noted.

Great location just off petrolia Rd on steeles!

I ordered takeout ahead, and the lady working the cash was super nice and recommended that I could call when I was closer so the order would be ready and fresh ( I was coming from York university). 

I ordered the spicy sin burger and sinner fries and they only took 10 minutes to make! The lady even apologized for the wait even tho I was only waiting 10 minutes.

The ONLY reason I'm giving this a 4 star review is because I like my burgers greasy. I'm a Priest guy, and I've tried all the local burgers, and although this burger isn't greasy, it tastes really good!

The sinner sauce and ketchup and cheese were enough to satisfy me and keep in mind that I had to commute another 30 minutes before I could enjoy my sinner fries at home.

They were saugy at home but still tasted fantastic! Not too salty or too bland at all, and they give generous portions of meat too!

In the north York area the only other good burger jt is all the way up at Leslie and 16th (Fresh Burger) but this place has more seats, clean facilities, and friendly staff, so I'll definitely be back and recommend this to everyone.

Fair prices and the shakes looked really good!"}
{"text":"Came here with a groupon. 

Burgers were pretty good. As others have stated they are not as good as Burgers Priest, but then again they are cheaper. They are better than McDonalds, but they are more expensive. 

I found the patty to be a little burnt. The toppings were pretty standard... Tomato, lettuce, onions etc. Would be better if there were more unique choices. Also I ordered it with the spicy sauce... Couldn't really taste the sauce not the spice. 

The fries are huge. One serving is easily enough for two. They were pretty decent. 

I would come again if I'm in the area. But if not I'd rather go pay a little more to have Burgers Priest."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!
Gives the sometimes-slacking, but very similar style, Burger's Priest a good run for it's money, but more consistent, a bit cheaper, and without the obscene line-ups. Plus they have parking and a few tables - bonus!

Love the fries. 
- fresh cut, medium thickness, though occasionally over-salted

Love the burgers 
- toasted buns (or decadent grilled-cheese buns) are a must!
- gotta add sautéed onions to get the full flavour effect

All in all, just really, really great.
GO! I promise you'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch and decided to get their \"the special\" burger at the recommendation of the cashier. The burger was an one patty burger with lettuc, tomato, and cheese. I didn't think there was anything too special about the burger, except for the buns. The buns were semi crispy and had a rich buttery taste. I also opted for the combo, which came with fries and a drink. The fries came with two different types of dipping sauce (I believe they make these in house). One was like a spicy mayo mix and the other one was closer to a taziki/white sauce mixture. They also have a good selection of canned soda. You can find vanilla and cherry cokes as well as grape, pineapple and mango fantas. Overall, I would have given 3 stars, but the cashier and even the cooks were friendly. I would come back here to try their other burgers if I am near this area."}
{"text":"We were craving burgers tonight and didn't feel like the usual neighbourhood choices. We took a short drive to Sinners Burger squeezing an order in just before they closed. They were super friendly, accommodating, and might I say...  The food was beyond delicious. Juicy flavourful burgers that taste as fresh as they are and cooked to perfection. We are SO pleasantly surprised to have a new burger joint and will be going back again for sure!!!! Great job guys, thanks for dinner and the foodcoma lol!"}
{"text":"I dont know what the say about Sinner. This one I been meaning to get to for a while but it location is out of the way and I only drop in because I had to make a trip to the west end anyone how and I could use Steeles to get back but today I dealt with so much traffic on Steeles that maybe i shouldnt have stop and tried to beat rush hour

So I had my own made burger, it was a double sin on golden bun (extra charger) with usual topping tomato lettuce pickle,  and their sin sause (might be just a spicy mayo/chipolte, which my guess)  and cheese and onion rings (both extra charge)  I think the charges add up. And what i dont get it menu says make it  a combo but i got sinner fries and drink and yeh their was no discount for it

Atleast they have check in 15% off which i used but that part doesnt make sense about making it a combo. Should have asked but it didnt. The place is big and spacial, and clean.

Thier sinner sauce is pretty good, their sinner fries tasted like mexicain topping on fries with a spicy sauce, beef, tomatoes and other things, the fries were good. I like it


The burger was good, the patty had some favour to it but it wasnt anything too great. It didnt taste bad, but it could been juicier and less cocked, it seem that the juice was cooked out of it but it wasnt burnt. 

I had a chocolate milkshake which i did enjoy, at first it was a little too thick form my likely but a little time pass and it loosen up to be more drinkable, it was creamer and good."}
{"text":"Tried Sinners today and the burger is legit. Although there isn't as much toppings to choose from as joints like Hero, the portion here is huge and dirty. The fries is also very well done with a canjun-like spice on it. The menu is also not cheap, but comparable to other burger places. The staff is also very nice and gave me a few of their signature sauces for free to accompany the fries. Overall, a surprisingly good place for burger enthusiasts."}
{"text":"Not bad, good hand made patties, burger got greasy but was still good

Solid 7/10 not on par with HC, FG or BP but better than spots like Stupid Burger

If you are a York student without a vehicle this may become a new favourite and is definitely good enough to try

My pro tip: call ahead to order as wait times in made to order take long and if they don't pick up don't go, means they probably turned newb and ran out of burger meat again"}
{"text":"I have only been to Sinners Burger twice, but there is ZERO consistency.

The first time, the burger was juicy, great, almost the same as Burger Priest, very saucy, and really great-tasting over-all

The second time was almost a complete opposite! The cheeseburger was heavily peppered and the patty was super dry, I made up my mind of not coming back to this place, especially that it is quite a bit of a drive from where I live."}
{"text":"First time here (thanks Groupon!).  Big burger fan and I was pleasantly surprised. Excellent meal, meat cooked perfectly (medium). I'm Québécois and can confirm that the poutine is authentic: perfect darker fries with soft center, decent gravy and real cheese curds. Only complaint is meal (both burger and poutine) was on the salty side.  My wife agrees. 
Bottom line is this is a joint worthy of repeat business."}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked for a while but took a long time to actually get around to it.

Loved the fries.  Place was large not the best layout, but that wasn't a big deal.
Excellent burger, nicely seasoned and juicy.  Bun couldn't contain the burger and that is the only drawback for the place.  Grilled onions were amazing and the bacon they have?  So tasty.
I'll be back here often."}
{"text":"Food is on point!! Best burger I've tried in a while! \"The fraud\" burger lives up to its name, but in my opinion is even better than what it's simulating. (You'll know when you eat it). The patty is fresh and the bun combined makes this place my new favourite burger joint. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer I went there on their 2nd day of being open: Definitely a good start! Things looked still in the process of being set up (more orientated to takeout at the moment but very nicely renovated/clean inside). I'll come back and update this review after going there a couple more times. 

Burgers were very good and fresh. Portion size was average (definitely filled me up but I wasn't stuffed). Fries were also good and a big portion. They were fast too (probably about 5 minutes of waiting) and service was nice. I liked that they weren't super greasy. 

My office is around the corner.. So with both me and my coworker being burger addicts we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here again for lunch with my wife. I told her how the Sinner Fries was so good, she wanted to try it. 

I ordered the Consequence and Spicy Sinners Fries (just can't get enough of that from last time!). I also got Cookies n Cream Milkshake. Burgers was super juicy and delicious. I didn't get any dry meat. Fries was fried perfectly, crispy and delicious!  Next time I'm getting Cookies n Cream again because I feel tastes way better than Vanilla. 

My wife got the Specials, Sinner Fries and Vanilla Milkshake. She loves it!  She can't get enough of the beef patty. Triple AAA, healthy and fresh!

Most definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Seriously awesome burgers - this one gives all others in Toronto a run for their money. I was formerly a die-hard Burger's Priest fan - which I still enjoy- but sinner's burger takes the belt imo. Buttered buns ftw!"}
