{"text":"I need something quick before work, I was on hurontario and I've heard people talk about Charlie's for a while, so said to myself y not.. Had the oxtails with rice and peas and a coleslaw. It's was good not the best I've ever had but ok.  Heard later that day, \"the jerk chicken is the best there\" lol Ill take there word for it."}
{"text":"I ordered jerk chicken and rice for takeout. The portion was way smaller than I've experienced at other jerk places. Only 3 pieces of chicken and one of them was all bone hardly any meat. They really pack in the rice to fill the container. Worse yet is the rice seems to be frozen stuff you'd get in any supermarket. It's what I call 'white people rice' with carrot and frozen green peas and NO oxtail gravy on it even though I asked for it. . Authentic jerk places use thick brown rice with large beans (peas) not frozen crap. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Horrible food,purchased doubles and phulorie. The doubles smelt and tasted sour clearly it was sitting out for a long time and went bad. When I called the restaurant to give feedback I was told \"that's how we make our food and if you don't like it dont come back here\". Clearly this establishment knows nothing about customer service. This restaurant needs to be investigated by the health authorities."}
{"text":"Some stuff is great, other stuff I'm not a fan of. I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 3 because I'm willing to go back and eat the stuff I like.

The veggie sides... hard pass on that. It's the frozen carrots and stuff you can buy at any grocery store. Any dish with that as a side option isn't on my radar any longer.

Escovitch fish... supposed to be a specialty item, I gave it a go. It was just a deep fried fish. The sauce wasn't on it, but in little container on the side. It wasn't even remotely what I expected it to be. So that's a hard pass too.

Now on the other hand, the doubles are spot on, and they're quite affordable. We've tried most of them and we keep gravitating toward the goat and vegetarian. Excellent. I also had jerk chicken on both rice and noodles, and both were excellent, and the chicken packed some heat :) 

Grab a menu while you are there and just place your orders from home. Big line-ups if you have to wait."}
{"text":"Not good service; actually the location on Hurontario and Dundas is the worst service ever with very small portions and steep prices. The staff behave like they're all having a bad day. It's one thing to ask that we support businesses in our community but it's another thing when we're getting service like that."}
{"text":"After being in a Caribbean mood for lunch I found Charlie's and was very impressed by the quality of its lunch specials! The jerk chicken has tons of flavour and spice, the chicken is moist and extremely tasty! The rice is covered in sauce and cooked really well. For a lunch bargain this is amazing! Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I used to get all my roti and Caribbean cuisine in Malton, but since I've found this place, it makes all the others question if they are actually Caribbean.  

The people are really quick to order your food, and very very friendly.  Although, this place is extremely small and sometimes too busy for my liking, so it would be ideal to have a bigger eating area.  But, then again because the food is so good, that's why it's so busy.

Their lunch specials are great! Quite a bit of variety.  I really really enjoy their rotis, and they even give you a choice of type of roti bread you would like.  They're guyanese fried rice is amazing as well.

Check this place out it's really really good."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken was great, rice and peas was perfectly cooked and flavourful, wonderful tender fall off the bone oxtail... Doubles were slightly soggy (but all doubles I've had were like that), but still delish! Fish soup was yum, but might be too fishy for some. My only complaint is that they serve everything with these nasty over cooked, bland, wet tasting, probably frozen vegetables (carrots, broccoli and, cauliflower). They were terrible with no flavour. Why not serve coleslaw? Loved everything other than that!"}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5 stars.

I was craving oxtail and since I live about 45 minutes my favourite place, Gem's House of Jerk on Airport RD and didn't want to leave my house ..I decide to order delivery from this place because it was on SkipTheDishes.com and had good reviews. 

I'm really hesitant ordering oxtail from anywhere that's clearly not Jamaican. I think this place is Guyanese/Trinidadian. 

You see, Jamaican oxtail is something special. It's savoury, sweet, perfectly spiced, juicy, tender, fall off the bone, a bit spicy and an all around amazing balance of flavours. It usually comes with a good amount of gravy. Oxtail needs need to be wet. Not a thick gravy, but a sweet, spicy, savoury syrupy gravy. 

Charlie's failed to deliver on what I need in my oxtail. The oxtail came on top heaping piles of  bland rice and peas. There was no aroma, it kinda had a faint taste of chicken stock. That's about it. The oxtail was decently tender..but it was dry..no gravy at all. What's the point of oxtail with no gravy? It was spiced nicely, and the oxtail tasted fresh..but it was just missing it's characteristic sweet/spicy kick. Instead of a nice coleslaw on the side..they decided to give you boiled/watery/Frozen broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. Complete turn off. 

They did however give me their homemade hot sauce made with either scotch bonnet or habanero peppers. That was soooo good ! It made the meal way better.

I also ordered the boneless jerk chicken dhalpuri roti. And to be honest, it was pretty good! My only complaint is that there was not enough chicken in the roti..they're was maybe 3 or 4 little shreds of chicken. But it was one of the best rotis I had in terms of flavour. I find rotis with dhalpuri can get very dry and it didn't happen here. I liked it!

All in all I wouldn't come back here unless I was craving some West Indian roti. Which is not very often because I rather get fat eating Jamaican oxtail."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely disgusting and customer service is horrible called ahead for a oxtail dinner 30 minutes before I got there. When I got there it was still not ready had to wait another 15 minuets. To add insult to injury the oxtail was very hard."}
{"text":"I have come back to this place multiple times since my first visit in 2014 and I have yet to be disappointed.  Their curries (I've tried their chicken, goat, and duck) are some of the better curries I've personally tried.  But it's actually their Chinese Caribbean food that I keep coming back to time and again.  Their stir-fries are cooked and seasoned beautifully and their fried rice dishes are IMO better than at any mainstream Chinese place I've ever been to.  I really wish this type of cuisine (Chinese Caribbean) was more widely available where I live but thankfully there are places like Charlie's I can travel to so I can get my fix.  A fantastic place."}
{"text":"I was there over the past weekend with my brother in law for lunch.

What we ordered:

He ordered  a Large Jerk Chicken over rice and peas ( beans) and veggies, it was amazing and the portion was huge. 

I ordered Large Ox tail over white rice and veggies ( they were out of coleslaw )
the ox tail was fantastic as usual, super flavorful and fork tender. and yes the portion was huge, i had to pack half of the plate to go :) 

The service was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Family friendly charming food! Brings back a whole lot of family loving traditions! Smooth service, worth waiting for! Love going to the store next door to purchase our roti shells and breadfruit! Island life is easy when you connect with your roots!
Huge portions and quality taste! These people never stop! Always working hard and with care! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best Caribbean food in sauga !!!!!! 

A great restaurant has  great food and service. 

I checked in right away and received a free drink. Who doesn't love free stuff ?????  

We ordered the noodle and goat roti. My friend that I went with had specifically requested her meal to come with shredded chicken in the noodles and extra curry on the side.  Somehow they forgot but when it was brought to their attention...the staff corrected the order instantly.   She didn't argue or get annoyed !!!   After that everything was perfect. The roti was fresh and flavour were on point !!! Their hot sauces made it all better. 

Even the noodles were yummy and fresh. The portion are so generous that was had leftovers. We also got to meet the man in charge of the place and he made sure we had a great experience.  The entire staff was friendly and quick !!!  Gr

The only negative thing I can say is that the  parking lot can get cramped. So park safely. 

Other then that, I do recommend and can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"I came here for a whole wheat roti...but ended up getting a lunch special.  I'm a sucker for lunch specials and could not substitute rice for roti.  Got the curry goat on rice and peas and a doubles.  It's kind of cool when you can eat Caribbean fast food on a proper plate instead of foam and get your own bottle of hot sauce at your table.  Curry goat was good but would be better boneless, although you can't go wrong for $5.99.  The doubles pastry itself was good while the stuffing was dry and pasty...you could tell it was not fresh.    Customer service was good and place is nice and clean.  Will come back to try their roti."}
{"text":"I got the Lamb roti here, wasn't bad but not the best I have had. Their mango hot sauce is not very tasty or very spicy. The other really spicy sauce is basically ground up pepper, not very unique or chef like, hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"This restaurant was my favorite dining place, even though I never really went in I ordered food from here almost every weekend. But my last meal was really bad: I had the curried boneless beef rice (that is what I always get), the beef tasted as if it went bad and the rice was dull. The meal usually includes rice beef and their special salad/cabbage, but not this time: there was no salad with the meal. Overall, this experience brought my 5 star opinion down to a 1, I really don't know whether I will order from here again..."}
{"text":"So I tried a more authentic Caribbean dish this time, oxtail with rice and peas.  Rice and peas are okay, but a bit bland for Caribbean food.  As for the oxtail, not bad, but not spicy enough.  I think this is a place you can go to if you want \"okay food\", but not something to go out of your way.  Previously review stands."}
{"text":"The wait is long.... but if you have time it's not bad. I had their festival (a little thicker than normal but still delicious), their goat bone in curry with brown rice which was good but found it a little too watery. The jerk chicken lomein was something new and the smokeyness from the wok they fried the noodles in was in every bite which my mom and I enjoyed. The jerk chicken was good but not the best I've had in sauga. Next time i'll try it on rice cause I think jerk sauce on top would have made a huge difference. The hot sauce on the table was very nice.

The best part was the service, they were very nice and even checked in a few times on us during our wait."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in the city for authentic Caribbean cuisine. Excellent service and great food.

My friend used to work here and introduced me to it recently. I've only been living in mississauga for a few months and so far this is my favourite place to go to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Tucked away at a semi deserted plaza, this location has phenomenal service that's sweet charming and warm. Welcoming and quick service. Free drink with purchase on entree with food prices that are very reasonable for flavorful and large portions. And I mean large portions even for a small order. Fast becoming my go-to spot for Caribbean cuisine. Bustling restaurant with long line up when we arrived but we were quickly taken care of. Not a date place, but for an every day meal deal, it's a go. Store exterior not appealing but don't be deceived and give it a try. Looks can be deceiving in this case."}
{"text":"NOT going back - rip off

We went there today and bought 5 lunch specials (4 fried rice and 1 stew chicken). We ate two of the specials there and took home the other 3. The two we ate there were excellent in taste and quantity.

But the 3 we took home (of the same thing) were a total rip off. The quantity was HALF of what they served in the restaurant for the same meal!
If you go there, inspect your take-out for quantity and quality. They are not to be trusted."}
{"text":"First time here: Friendly service, fast take out. Had the special chicken fried rice.  

Next time I am going to try their doubles."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it's pretty good. It's a solid 4/5.

I've tried the jerk chicken on fried rice... Really good. Right amount of spice and very fresh! Love Chinese mixed with Caribbean cuisine. The stew chicken is not a traditional Jamaican brown stew chicken... It's more of a Trinidadian feel. I wasn't a fan, BUT their festivals and plantain... WOW. So delicious. Some Caribbean places serve dry unripened plantain and it's not as enjoyable. I've had a side order of plantain every time I've been here and they have to marinate it because it's just so yummy. Their festivals were hot, fresh and not too sweet. I also tried their doubles because of my fellow yelpers raving reviews... Have to say they were disappointing. I had the chickpea filled one and It was so soggy, and the chickpeas were not cooked all the way through. It would've been a bit better if the chickpeas were softer or mashed inside the double. 

Customer service is good, prices are fair, parking lot is always packed so it's hard to find a spot. They serve $5.99 lunch specials (jerk chicken, stew chicken, oxtail etc) and have daily take out specials for the family (trays of food) that range from $20-$30.

I'll be back for their Caribbean Chinese dishes, plantain and festivals when I'm in the area!  I still believe the BEST Caribbean Chinese take out food I've had is from Benab Family Restaurant (formerly known as Sijan)."}
{"text":"Do not go! Me and my friend ordered two jerk chickens dishes and two cups of iced waters. They brought out two bottles of water. We didn't ask for bottled water. Then they tried to sell us other items in the menu saying how it is really good. We said no and they kept saying how it's really good everyone gets it, are you sure you want to try? My food came I was a quarter way almost done eatting it and I saw hair in my food. I told the waitress and she laughed. She didn't even apologize. The bill came and she asked how we liked the food and if we're coming back. Do not go!"}
{"text":"They have great food here. But I feel like they often make mistake, which make your order delayed. And on top of that, they don't seem to enjoy their job and I often see them taking it out on their customers with attitude. There's no need to be rude to people that support your work and business when they aren't being rude themselves. Overall, there are MUCH better options for Caribbean food in the GTA, even in the same area...so it's not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Yummers, I think I found *my* roti place in the city!!!  White/whole wheat roti & rice available upon request.  There was no additional cost for whole wheat roti, not sure if it's the same case with the rice.

(I believe that you can also order dhalpuri or parantha shells.)

I ordered a chicken (boneless) roti on whole wheat and it was delicious!  Not too saucy and meat/gravy was nicely seasoned.  If you can take the heat, make sure you ask for a hot sauce with your take out!

Even though the interior is newer, it's a smaller, ma 'n pa joint, so it's probably best for take-out.

You can also order a small sized roti which is $5.99.  Lotsa daily specials posted at the counter.  What impressed me was that all the protein options (chicken/beef/shrimp/goat/duck/fish) were all the SAME price - $7.99!!!  Usually, I can only eat about half of a regular sized, so it's a decent value, especially the meats that are usually more expensive."}
{"text":"Their roti is some of the best in Mississauga. And at a good price too.
they have a wide variety to caribbean food and its all really good, check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm in loooooove with a Guyanese girl ! 
Get the Charlie's special fried rice or chow Mein (chicken on top and extra pepper on the side)."}
{"text":"When I'm at 5 and 10 I usually come here for doubles. I love the doubles with chicken in them. If you have tried doubles before I don't even know how to describe these pockets of goodness. I would consider them the Trinidadian pizza pockets. They are two little fluffy pillows stuffed with chicken peas curry and the meat of your choice. A lot of places serve then without meat but here you can add goat, chicken, shrimp, etc. you can also ask them to make it spicy. 

I can't rate their Caribbean  food (oxtail, jerk, curry goat, etc.) because I haven't tried it But I have tried their Asian influence dish like special chicken fried rice and I love it! Asian Caribbean food is one of my favourite things to eat and Charlie's does it right."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick bite when i was in Sauga.

Special Chicken fried rice ($6 for lunch size)
Portion wise, this was good enough for me. There were 3 pieces of chicken, I personally think it could use one more piece but for $6 I'm not going to complain! The chicken meat was tender, not dry at all and the skin was surprisingly crispy! The fried rice was flavorful on its own and had lots of ingredients as well like mixed veggies and some chicken pieces. I also asked for Tamarind sauce (+$0.75), and added it to my chicken and fried rice. Loved the sauce! Hard to describe it but it has a slight tarty flavor to it. I also added a bit of their hot sauce, but careful it's really spicy. You can actually feel the heat stay in your mouth after.

Remember to check in for a free drink! It applies for the sodas too - I tried the grapefruit one. Don't ask me why grapefruit flavor was green, but it definitely was grapefruit flavor!

Oh and I should mention, the staff is super friendly!!
I will be coming back to try their Jerk chicken."}
{"text":"Food quality has gone downhill over the years. Their food is always tasting like it's about to go bad or if not, already spoiled. I still went back a few more times, and even ordered for family and friends to see if it would get any better, but nope. 

A majority of people that say their menu is good, hasn't been raised in a household that was predominantly nourished by this type of cuisine. So the average Saugan wouldn't know the difference in the quality and taste.

Charlie's please, store your food better and use fresh ingredients, your food tastes nasty"}
