{"text":"Good espresso, great bakery. The place is very new, a bit hard to spot from outside, but huge and stylish inside. Nice ambience. Worth checking!"}
{"text":"I went in with pretty high hopes given the description but came away quite disappointed. While the place is nice and the staff is friendly, there really isn't a huge selection of baked goods. Worse yet the place falls for most of the same west-end trappings. I'm fine paying more for a nice location, but I was shocked to find that a Burek was $3.00 for a small piece (you can get a pie for as much in most places), one small glass of Turkish tea was $3.00 (it is typically served by the pot). These are basic staples that one would enjoy in reasonable quantities at any true Turkish cafe or bakery, not being able to share a pot of tea or some food with friends really negates any cultural experience. As such, there are much better options for coffee in the area. There wasn't even any bread on the shelves to take home."}
{"text":"Solid coffee shop with attentive staff and a decent, if limited, menu. Haven't had the Turkish breakfast but it sounds delicious. High ceilings and lots of space mean it's surprisingly quiet, a good place to work and study."}
{"text":"Strolling along Queen Street West looking for a place for lunch.  If had not been for the sandwich board on the sidewalk would have walked by the unassuming storefront.  

Such a different feel once inside!  

Relaxed environment despite the number of people in the restaurant.  Was easily able to have a conversation with my friend without having to shout to be heard or worry about the adjoining tables intruding in our space. 

Enjoyed the Turkish breakfast.   Beautifully presented.  A lovely combination of freshly made breakfast food .... great for lunch, brunch or lunch!  A hearty meal without being too much.  Also had the Turkish coffee.  Served in artfully on a wooden platter in a gorgeous espresso cup and saucer and little nibble of Turkish delight.  Loved the flavour.

Will be back to try other menu items and enjoy the space again."}
{"text":"Beautiful space with lots of seating, outlets and fast and reliable WiFi. The atmosphere was very pleasant and relaxed (even when the place was full), with music gently playing in the background. 

I ordered an americano misto and a feta and parsley borek, and my friend bought an americano and a Nutella swirl pastry. The coffee was delicious! Probably the best americano misto I've ever had, actually. It was well balanced, rich and smooth, with surprising sweet cocoa undertones. The pastries, unfortunately, were rather underwhelming. Nice flavor, but pretty dry. For $4, I expected more cheese filling in my borek. I probably won't try any more pastries but I'll definitely be back for more coffee!"}
{"text":"Loved the lattes here. They have the cutest latte art and the nicest and most friendly baristas here. They use propeller coffee beans and it's really good. Latte was smooth and rich. 

The baked goods were not bad either. The simit was like a very thin St. Viateur Montreal baked. Very good with cheese. Fluffy nutella bagel lived up to its name - fluffy and not dense at all and good flavor of nutella. I'd say the baked goods were a little pricey for what you're getting but I'd come back for the espresso drinks!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just stopped into this trendy Turkish cafe, and good God, their Greek yogurt and cherry Danish was unreal. My wife exclaimed, \"This is the best Danish that I've ever had in my life\". Agreed. The coffee is also excellent."}
{"text":"It's not closed! Service and food is always great, one of my fave cafes in Toronto."}
{"text":"Awesome place with its great staff and service quality!!  As a big simit (Turkish styled bagel) fan ,I am very happy that I found this place..Will go there again any time soon to try out their Turkish coffe and buy couple french bagets :)) Good job guys ,keep it up! 

Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"My review is solely based on the espresso. And wow! What a terrible one it was. Absolutely the worst espresso I've ever had in my life. Blame it on the beans? Sure! Whatever...NEVER again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Clean, spacious, and modern looking cafe serving various coffee beverages (including Turkish coffee). Lots of space to sit, relax, and enjoy a book with your beverage.
Service: Good - Our order took about 5 minutes so we sat down to wait and they brought it to our table for us. 
Product: Ordered a Turkish Coffee, Flat White, and baklava. Both drinks were very flavourful and tasted like high quality coffees.  The baklava wasn't too sweet (which I preferred) and was very tasty.  
Recommendation: They have a gelato counter with a variety of exotic flavours which I think you should go try."}
{"text":"Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople... 

This new café at Bathurst and Queen is more spacious than it looks when you walk in, though it still retains that intimate charm found in most cafes.  The décor is pleasant, and the tables were filled with the usual crowd you find anywhere.

Their specialty is the Turkish coffee that is served on a beautifully designed espresso cup, with a piece of Turkish delight on the side.  The price is quite reasonable for the novelty of the drink, though it takes a little longer wait before it's ready. The taste is bracing with the grinds still present, though I wish the portion was bigger, and the roast darker. 

I also had an apple crown pastry, which while not 100% authentic is still within the realm of Turkish, as apple tea is popular there.  Staff are also friendly and helpful, and they post the password at the tables for the wifi, which was a nice touch even though I missed it.  Will definitely give Early Bird across the street some healthy competition.

Take me back to Constantinople..."}
{"text":"Decent amount of seating and workspace. They have various Turkish coffees and teas. I got the muffin sandwich which was average at best. They also offer a simit (Turkish bagel) but you have to serve yourself and there is no salmon addon. The location is nice and atmosphere is great the music isn't too loud and plenty of space."}
{"text":"Service was great! They offered to let me sample all the ice cream before I picked a flavour. Settled on the strawberry basil gelato which was sooo refreshing. Flat white was also very smooth. 

Service and food much better than Early Bird across the street."}
{"text":"Directly across the street from Early Bird this place adds another dimension of cafe to the immediate area.  They offered something you don't see just about everywhere which is a Turkish coffee served in a pretty good looking cup and saucer.

Me, I didn't actually have it but I saw after my friend ordered it and it wasn't exactly how I remember seeing the last Turkish coffee I drank which was very thick and dark, thicker looking than espresso.  The Turkish coffee takes almost 8-10 minutes to make.  Of course they offer more than just that particular coffee.  

The inside is larger than Early Bird and has a good vibe to the place."}
{"text":"Was in the area so decided to finally try my first Turkish coffee! I twas served in a tiny, miniature sized cup with a glass of water on the side and ordered it sweetened, as recommended by the cashier because of the grimey bottom. I also ordered a Water borek (has feta and spinach(?) in it) ($3.75) and my total came to ~$8. I have to say, it was not nearly as \"espresso-y\" as I expected and wasn't thick at all. You can't drink right to the very bottom because of the coffee grime. 

Totally didn't live up to the hype that I expected. Maybe it was my luck? Maybe because they were busy? I'm not sure, but I'd think twice about coming back for my caffeine fix."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is really nice (modern, unique, pretty), this is a great date spot or place to have a meeting over coffee. A few large tables that you can share with other people, and also smaller tables for just two people. 

Personally, I was not a fan of the Turkish coffee, it was really bitter and tasted chalky (Maybe it's just not my thing). However, I was a fan of how it was served since it was presented really nicely. I will try something else next time since they have a number of different coffee/tea options. They seem to have a number of appetizing baked goods, so I'd like to go back and try some of those."}
{"text":"This place is great! So happy to have simit on Queen West."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous place to get some work done and not feel too crowded or rushed. Lovely staff, decor, and variety of offerings. I opted for a london fog which was velvety smooth and had just the right amount of vanilla. I also tried their baklava - super-sweet, but appropriately bite size. I was very intrigued by their ice cream flavours such as eggplant! I will have to save room for that next time. Reliable wifi and good variety of seating with large communal tables at the front and smaller tables at the back. I would be back next time I am looking for a good palce to work or hang out!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite cafe on queen street. The people working there are very friendly and helpful. The coffee is delicious and they have really great food options. I like the breads, bagels, croissants and breakfast options. 
This place is also huge! They have a ramp so it's easy to access for anyone including strollers or wheelchairs. It's very spacious inside and they did a great job with the decor. Basically it's cute and has free wifi so people wanna hang out there all day. Because of that once in a while it's hard to get a spot, but most of the time it's fine."}
{"text":"Delicious cookies that pair nicely with Death in Venice gelato. 

They have a variety of loose leaf tea, and they can make iced tea with freshly brewed loose leaf tea! Amazing. Rare find in cafes that aren't specialty tea shops. 

They have wifi and nice tables. They're open till 7. This is the perfect place for going after work to do even more work! Perfect if you're a workaholic in the area. 

Filtered water too!

This place is amazing and I can't wait to go back for more gelato, cookies, tea/coffee, and a quiet work environment in the bustling Queen West neighbourhood. They even have their wall of windows open when the weather is warm! Fresh air too! 

Oh, and friendly service! Nice people work there. Go here! Or don't--more space for me."}
{"text":"Don't be fool by the small store frontage of Constantinople Bakery & Coffee. I was amazed  when I walked through the door and entered into the cafe itself. The space is cozy and huge with ample seating and even a bakery and chocolatier making their products fresh on site.

Turkish Coffee ($3.90) was not as I remembered: not as strong, thick and bold. But the Turkish delight sweet did save the day. Though labour intensive and nicely presented, $4 for that cup really does not justify the price tag. I will stay with espresso coffee next time.

I will be back and chill out a little longer next time!"}
{"text":"I was about to go to Early Bird across the street when I noticed this place and thought I'd give it a try. The space is huge, with classic dark wood finishing, red leather benches, and a bakery in the back with glass walls.

I ordered a cannelle, which was dreamy - custardy melt-in-your mouth crumb with a crispy crust that tasted like dark brown sugar. The macchiato was rich and complex, definitely on par with some of the better coffees I've tried. 

I give this place a fifth star for having wifi, power outlets, and lots of seating, a combination that's hard to find in busy Toronto. I'll be back."}
