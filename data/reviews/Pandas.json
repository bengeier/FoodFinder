{"text":"Was in training all week in Richfield so I stopped in here one day for a lunch break. I know it's a chain but what the heck, I have only been here one other time before. I had the General Tso's and it was good. Not too spicy which is what I prefer. The fried rice was, well, fried rice. I did notice a sign that your request your personal level of spice of which I didn't indicate to them. 
     The thing that stuck out was that my order was ready in under five minutes and I was there during the lunch rush. Perfect place to go for a quick lunch and it will satisfy the early afternoon Chinese craving. $5.75 for the meal and a can of Pepsi, what's not to like."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife on a whim, and we were impressed! Food was very fresh. Shrimp were colossal. I ordered Hunan chicken and thought it was just the perfect blend of spices and heat. We'll be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Very good lunch buffet. I liked everything. Bourbon chicken is some of the best I have had. Crispy like it was off of the grill. Chinese food is still Chinese food. All the same."}
{"text":"Very decent food, good prices and a picture of Shaquille O'Neal are the attractions.  Limited seating but a great cheap lunch menu."}
{"text":"We frequent this place at least once or twice a month.  The owners are super nice.  We usually get the honey chicken, but everything I have had is good.  Their lunch is super fast with lots of choices.  They will customize anything, because my husband doesn't care for onions..."}
{"text":"For a take out place, their food are good. BUT one time we saw 2 mice in the dining area and never went back again!  I gave a 2 stars instead of 1 because honestly speaking, the food taste good, but I don't think i will ever go back!"}
{"text":"40 MINUTE WAIT + NO RICE + TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE + DIRTY + SO-SO FOOD + PAYING TWICE = NEVER GO BACK!!!  I hope the owner reads this, because I would rather tell them to their face.

Went there many times because I work around the corner.  I've spent a ton of money at this place, but never again.

Overall, the place is pretty dirty, but the food was \"decent\" & it was close, so...

Had a HORRIBLE problem last week.  Ordered at the counter & was told 5-10 minute wait.  It was Friday night & very busy, but I didn't mind waiting.  The problem is that (4) customers came AFTER me, ordered at the counter, and were gone for 10-15 minutes while I stood there.  I wouldn't have waited, but I had paid them already & wanted my food.

After 40 MINUTES, I finally had enough & wanted my food.  They told me that they didn't have any white rice to complete my order.  I told them in 40 minutes, I could have made my own white rice.  I asked why other customer orders (for customers who came after me) were filled before mine, they said it was because I had a \"big order\".  My order was $43 -- not a \"big order\".

Finally, I just wanted my food, but they wanted me to pay again!!!  (Seems they lost my CC receipt).  I left with a $43 charge & no food!  For sure I can rectify with my Mastercard, but I will NEVER GO BACK!!!

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!  Better Chinese elsewhere, Theresa's pizza in the same plaza is good, and at least Subway next door doesn't take your money & ignore you."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get piping hot General Tsos chicken! If you go during lunch time they have a fast food style lunch where you can pick two sides (highly recommend the lo mein) and two meats (General Tsos is always hot and spicy) for like $8 (comes with a drink or side of wonton soup). It's been great every time I've been!"}
{"text":"First time here... Average at best. Not sure I would go back, food was very bland"}
