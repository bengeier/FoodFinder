Small mum and pop shop with a big punch. 

Their burgers are amazing here, with a great portion that definitely won't leave you hungry. 

They aren't all about the burgers tho, they have a nice variety of foods, whether you're coming here for breakfast or craving souvlaki! 

The food is always made fresh here and toppings are added right In Front of your eyes. 

The staff here are super friendly and fairly quick. 

Five out of five starts for this place!"}
{"text":"This spot is my fav spot for lunch and breakfast.  Its convenient, fast (if you call ahead) and tasty.  Situated around me are other restaurants, but the thing that gets me coming here frequently are the wings and spicy fries.  The breakfast special is also priced well, with a lot of food, (Scrambled eggs, potatoes, toast and Bacon/sausage for 5$)  

This place is a family owned restaurant, with exceptional service and a warm atmosphere.  I highly recommend Alexander's if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Made a spontaneous stop here this afternoon, found a new breakfast place! Got two full breakfast meals with coffee & toast for $15 after tax. For all you crispy potato lovers, this is the spot. There were customers beside us eating the burgers and they looked amazing, must try next time. Service is very friendly too. Just sad we haven't tried this place earlier. Definitely coming back :) Amazing quality food and service for a great price!"}
{"text":"Its a nice place managed my an old  friendly couple. I'd say this is a good lunch spot for those who work in the richmond hill financial district. I usually have their Homemade burger, it's not very greasy and a very generous serving for a reasonable price. Their fries are one of the best I have had in a burger shop, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside yummmmm!

The decor is wooden and the environment is quite, with sunlight coming inside during lunch hours on a sunny day, makes a very good environment to go with your colleagues."}
{"text":"A homemade 6 oz. juicy cheeseburger, seasoned fries, and a snapple for $8 and change. Tasty, affordable, and fast!

They also offer chicken & fish dishes, dinner combos, and all-day breakfast. You can also place orders over the phone."}
{"text":"Ordered Haddock fish and chips for lunch take out. Fries substituted for spicy fries. Spicy fries is not spicy at all, more like seasoned fries but I love the crispiness and taste. Fish batter is not that great as I have tried something better but for the price, its ok.

Lots of interesting food choices. I would like to try dining in next time as my colleagues rave about this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast and home burger. One comment please don't be lazy and cook the breakfast potatoes thoroughly. No one likes to bite into a raw potato."}
{"text":"Nice homemade burger.  Banquet burger was delicious and made to order.  Definitely going back!

Spicy fries were not spicy at all, but they were still good.  Maybe I'll get onion rings next time."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Alexander's! I LOVE this place!!

My mom introduced me to it because she works very close by. Hell, it's very close to my house! Just one of those hidden gems I never really came across.

This is one of my go-to's for mainly breakfast/brunch but really any meal! This along with Wimpy's and Eighty8.

The way it works is you order at the counter and pay and sit down and they call your order when it's ready which is usually pretty fast but at lunch time on a weekday they get VERY busy!

I usually order the same thing every time, the western omelette which comes with toast and home fries but some days when I'm feeling healthier I'll skip the toast and get a side salad. HOWEVER, I came here with my boyfriend the day after I got home from Bonnaroo, a festival in Tennessee where I barely ate for 4 days for..numerous reasons :P so obviously by the time I reached home I was dying of hunger. I got my usual omelette, decided I was still hungry and ordered a BURGER! I highly recommend. It was so delicious it basically melted in my mouth. If you've read my previous reviews you know that I'm no fancy Nancy when it comes to burgers, I just like my patty with some lettuce pickles and ketchup, maybe some mustard and mayo if I'm feeling frisky haha. This burger was so good, I've craved it since that fine day in June when I was malnourished and Alexander's came to my rescue!!

The staff are also really friendly. It's always the same people working. I remember one time I was waiting for an order and one of the ladies was talking to me and I didn't realize because I was on my phone (probably Yelping) and she got a little ticked off. WHATEVS :)

Also, the reason I don't have a photo of the burger is because I ate it at the speed of light :)"}
