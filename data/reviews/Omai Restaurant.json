{"text":"Food, ambience, service, value: 4-4.5/5

Everything is good to superb. Finally a terrific resto in Baldwin Village. 

This is my favorite Japanese bar by far now. Would highly recommend reservations for 2 or more in advance as this is a cozy establishment :) I can see this place catching on fast.

Other notes: Only alcohol served here is sat"}
{"text":"-The short version- 

Just go here, you won't be disappointed. Been here many times and I keep bringing a different friend to try it out. Small menu, expensive if you want to be full, but oh so worth it. It's a good time, the staff are kind and attentive. I recommend booking a seat by the bar, the best seat to watch the temaki chef. 

-The long version-

Atmosphere: 
A very small place, there are not many seats, so I recommend making reservations. 

Food and Drink: 
They are known for their Temaki (sushi hand roll). They make them fresh and serve them to you one at a time. They are pre-seasoned, no need for the soy sauce in my opinion. My favourites: big eye tuna and king salmon. They only make Temaki when it comes to sushi, so no sushi rolls or sashimi, don't go in expecting any of that. Favourite kitchen menu items: the Croquettes (delicious - a must have) and the Chicken Liver Pate (so great)! The Beef Cheek is also my favourite. Small, appetizer-sized portions. 

This is a sake bar, so they have a great small selection of sake. I had the Kippon Junmai Ginjo (sweet, fruity) as well as the traditional Junmai (drier, in my opinion) on my visits, both were great! 

Service: 
Everyone is kind, attentive, and they make great recommendations.

One of my favourite spots for fresh temaki! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Amazing bar vibes!! A new version bar/tapas place for 2-4 group of friends enjoying talks over amazing sake that goes well with the temaki and the kitchen menu. Sake a bit overpriced, but you do get to try the variety of sake from Japan. Food goes so well with the same. A definite must try."}
{"text":"This restaurant on Baldwin street is not the easiest to find as the sign is discreet. Upon entering, you feel the hip and relaxed vibe. Service was attentive, the warm sake recommended by our server was quite delicious and much needed on a cold winter evening, and overall, the food was good. 

Although we were very impressed with their kitchen menu, the temaki, which we had high hopes for, was a let down. We found the rice in the temaki to be slightly dry, which was a big a disappointment. We tried the red sea bream, tamago and octopus temakis. Overall, the combination of ingredients in each temaki and flavours were good, but the drier rice didn't leave us wanting more. 

From the kitchen menu, we tried the following dishes:

- Yu Choy ($7) - A common way to cook yu choy, a Chinese leafy green vegetable, is to blanch it quickly and serve it with oyster sauce. This is a much fancier version, with the yu choy served on top of a light dashi broth, complimented with a cashew miso butter. We didn't find this dish special as the cashew miso butter didn't have much flavour, although the presentation was nice.

- Croquette ($9) - The fried butternut squash and creamy oka cheese had a nice melt in your texture. Although we enjoyed the dish, we didn't really taste the nori in the aioli, which we felt would have added that nice umami punch if the flavour was stronger.

- Sunomono ($11) - The vinaigrette in this dish was very refreshing and we really liked the ingredient combination. The octopus was tender, and the cucumber and zucchini added some texture to the dish. 

- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Chicken Liver Pate ($12) - The addition of the orange blossom honey to the chicken liver pate was very creative and it really elevated the flavours with the sweet and tangy notes. This was one of our favourite dishes.

- MUST ORDER: Pork Belly ($14) - This was definitely our favourite dish for the evening. The skin on the pork belly was crispy, yet the pork belly itself literally melted in our mouths. The dish was also balanced in flavour and the sunchokes added a nice earthy and nutty taste.

- Beef Cheek ($16) - The beef cheeks were really tender and the persimmon added a nice sweetness.

Overall, we really enjoyed the kitchen menu, especially the hot food. There is a lot of potential here, but as mentioned above, the slightly dryer rice in the temakis was a huge disappointment as we were expecting these to be more of the highlight for our meal."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends and sat at the bar facing the chef. Fantastic dining experience. Excellent atmosphere, service, drinks selection, and of course, the food.

Ordered the scallop (special) , salmon, and uni (special) temaki. Also had a the fired chicken, chicken liver pâté, and bavette steak. Every dish was a hit!! Omg that bavette steak!!! Just thinking about it still makes me drool! 

Excellent dining experience and food! I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it is on the pricey side. But aside from that, it was a perfect dining experience!

Great job!! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try because of the 4 star reviews on Yelp.. and I was very disappointed. The dishes are extremely overpriced for its value (yes I know this is tapas style and I've been to many restaurants of similar style), I was simply not impressed with the ingredients/flavour/presentation. To be clear I came here for dinner so the menu is different from lunch. 

The hand rolls are what I assume the restaurant's \"specialty\". We tried what was recommended by our waiter, the ingredients itself lacked its own flavour, and all I could taste was the overwhelming salty taste from large chunks of kosher salt... the sushi rice were a bit dry and for the price I expected a lot more... 1/5 stars

We also tried a few \"hot dishes\", including the steak, pork belly, and octopus salad... let's start w the salad because it came with three paper thin slices of octopus...  pork belly was three 1-inch cubes of meat with skin, it was okay but the giant chunks of green onion stems was a bit of a turn off. I don't rmb much abt the steak except it was really tough to chew.. 2/5 stars for hot dishes...

I think for a sake bar, the dishes should be at least enjoyable and easy to share... I get that tapas come in small portions but this place really took that to the extreme...

Won't be returning again and really don't understand the 4 stars review."}
{"text":"Was so excited to hear about a new Japanese restaurant in town. Unfortunately was left with a terrible experience without even having a chance to try it. Booked a special occasion dinner for 3ppl on Nov 28/17 for Dec 15/17 @ 8pm - called & made a reservation with name & # - he even repeated my # before hanging up. Day of the dinner celebration, i call an hr before heading to the restaurant to confirm & they told me they are sorry but the restaurant is booked out for the night for a private event & they were unable to reach me because they had my # wrong. The staff i spoke to advised me that they were bought out after i made the reservation & therefore that came in higher priority than my booking. Extremely upset as it was a special occasion dinner planned & left with an hour on a Friday night to reschedule something else...What if i showed up at the restaurant with my friends to be advised that they cant serve me?....I requested to speak to the manager Edward who apologized & told me that the buy out was done prior to my reservation - conflicting information being told to me from the original staff member. I asked him to provide me the # that they apparently tried several times to reach me at to cancel - he tried to look it up but said sorry that information was deleted...just a huge disappointment & sorry definitely does not cut it."}
{"text":"A hip, unique sake bar with a focus on temaki hand roll. You sit by the bar, and the servers are also the chefs! 
We tried all the hand rolls and the standouts are:

Ganpyo - surprisingly delicious, the humble daikon is marinated with a mirin, soy sauce base, paired perfectly with creamy avocado. 
Tamago: if you enjoy truffle you will like this. 
Shrimp: refreshing and creamy.
Salmon: hard to detect maple flavour but very fresh. 

Most of the snack menu we tried were good but nothing really stood out. Karaage has a light interesting batter. Overall it's a tad overpriced for what it is. Bill was $150 for three of us with a drink each. It's a cute place for an intimate date or friend catch up."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening for the very first time and was seated at the bar area. There were three of us and we each ordered 3 rounds of Temaki (hand rolls). From the selection of 7 types of hand rolls, I was able to try three: Ganpyo, Tamago, and King Salmon. My personal favourite out of the three would be the Tamago which has sweet egg and truffle. The aroma of the truffle fills your mouth when you bite into the hand roll, even the person sitting next to you can smell the truffle. It was delicious. The Ganpyo consisted of daikon (winter radish), avocado, and sesame. If you like refreshing and crunchy fillings, this hand roll is for you. The King Salmon was okay, nothing too special. Although the menu states that there's maple flavour along with daikon, all you really taste is the salmon. You can barely taste the maple. 

From the kitchen menu, we ordered the Croquette, Fried Chicken, Soon Dog, and Bavette Steak to share. The croquette was deep fried to perfection with a butternut squash and oka cheese filling with a nori aioli on the side. The fried chicken was seasoned with house spices served with ramp aioli. It was a little on the salty side for my liking. As for the soon dog, which is blood sausage, sake steam bun, plum mustard, and sage chips, the bun was a little hard. I personally don't like eating intestines and organs, so I didn't really enjoy eating it, but the sage chips on the side were really good. They were thinly sliced and tasted even better than Lays original flavoured chips. Lastly, the bavette steak was probably the highlight of the entire meal. The steak was cooked medium rare and was very tender and juicy. It was grilled with kalbi butter and served with roasted eggplant and garlic chips and wasabi. 

This restaurant is fairly new to Baldwin street and it already quite popular, so if you plan on coming, I'd recommend making a reservation as seats as limited. The quality of the photos I'd be sharing will be comprised as the lighting in the restaurant is fairly dim."}
{"text":"Wow . Wasnt really expecting much but when I stepped into the restaurant i was blown away by the layout . Very authentic ! I had lunch there with a friend we ordered strictly the temaki and heres what Ive tried : 

Wild shrimp (4/5) 
Red sea brean (4.3/5)
Scalllop (4/5) 

An appetizer of greens with miso butter ( which frankly you can skip and save $5 lol ) 

My friend ordered :

Salmon and tuna and she felt it was just ok! 


I didnt get a chance to order the chirashi but i would definitely go back and try ! Very good japanese restaurant in Baldwin def would recommmend this place !"}
{"text":"Probably the best chirashi in its price category, and definitely the only one of its kind. It was mostly uni, as advertised, but so much more. It had 3 types of eggs: tamago, caviar, and dalops of egg yolk that was soft boiled or sous vide. And other treaures like pickles, snow peas, coarse sea salt, little edible flowers and some well placed furikake, not carelessly sprinkled in clumps. It also had some isolated smears of spicy-mayo like sauce, but much tamer. 

While the chirashi was being made, I was served some miso soup and an amuse bouche. The miso soup was unexpectedly flavourful, like a mouthful of crustaceans. The amuse bouche was grilled zucchini that tasted more smoky than any way I can imagine grilling a zucchini.

Overall, it was a luxurious meal that didn't feel over-the-top. You can tell a lot of attention went into everything but nothing came off as trying too hard. The food, the decor, even the visual composition of the dishes, the sound system, the service, and I think the wasabi was freshly grated too. Good job, Omai :)"}
{"text":"3.6/5

Omai is little up scale modern izakaya that you often see in new york. Think of it as quieter, classier and spacious version of Hanmoto with exceptional service. 

Their temaki: hand rolls are what they are most known for but I find they are decent but also nothing to write home about. I only tried three rolls : tuna, uni and tamago. Tuna roll has deep fried bits so it has nice contrasting texture. However, i find tuna parts they used in the roll isn't the best parts nor freshest tuna. Thankfully it didn't have strong fish smell but it's mushy and pate like texture was quite disappointing. However, the biggest disappointment of the night was the uni roll. It's was simple uni roll but uni was very bitter and have absolutely no sweetness from the fresh uni. And I believe this plain small uni roll was charged somewhere around $13 or more. Tamago truffle roll was interesting. It has decent black truffle paste in it but the tamago they made was not exactly japanese style fluffy cake like egg roll. It was lack in pillowy texture with light sweetness that I enjoyed Japan. Will I order more hand rolls in a future?  I might try other hand rolls to see if they come up with interesting combination but otherwise probably not. 

While hand rolls are bit of disappointment, kitchen dishes are on much better side. I tried sunomono, soon dog, pork belly and bavette steak. I personally didn't enjoy sunomono and soon dog as much as I hope so. Sunomono is light refreshing zucchini noodle dish topped with sliced shrimps and octopus. The soup/sauce of the dish has very clean refreshing taste but with zucchini noodle, it was way too bitter and bland. Sweetness of shrimp definitely helped balancing the taste but octopus was flavorless and just over all unbalanced dish. Soon dog.. I had high hopes with this dish. I like soondae (Korean blood sausage) and European blood sausage. So I was very excited when I saw this on the menu. However, when I tried it, it was very disappointing. The outer of the sausage didn't have that crunchy or popping sensation of nice sausage shell and stuffing inside was bland. But it could work well if it had good condiments that can put everything together. But they only used regular plain ketchup and mustard that don't go well with the sausage and nor add any positive element to the dish. Although the bun was cooked to perfection, poor execution really destroy the potential of this dish. So till this point, I was bit disappointed with food at Omai. However, things took big turn with last two dishes: pork belly and bavette steak. I won't write too much of these two dishes. If you enjoy crunchy skin tender pork belly and extremely tender bavette steak with light kalbi sauce, these are must try.  These dishes saved the night for me and I guarantee you these will do same to you. 

Now about the service, I have absolutely no complain what so ever and this is very rare for me! I never expected to receive such an attentive and proper service from small place like this but our server delivered equivalent customer service like jacobs or canoe and I must say I was extremely pleased. My only complain is unusual slow service with food. Every dishes came out in a extremely slow pace. Luckily, I was with a good company to not get bothered by this but it was very very slow and the place wasn't too busy so I'm not sure why there was such a large time gap between each dishes.

Overall, I love the fact it's a little discreet cozy bar you can walk in to have a quality time with a great service. I'll come back again when I'm in a mood for chill night."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner. This is a nice place to take a date after the movies or after visiting the AGO. And is quite cozy especially if you want to watch the chef work and work their magic at the bar seating or sit at the tables. The place only had 3 tables aside from the bar, so it is recommended that you make a reservation beforehand if you plan on going during a busier time. There is quite a lot of care that goes into each dish as you can tell that there is a balance of flavors and that each piece had its own individuality. However, their prices were a bit high considering the portion sizes and the taste was a bit too subtle. The Temaki could do with a better presentation as it doesn't look like it is anything special. I think if they had a tasting menu that had a progression for a prix fixe versus ordering a la carte would've had a better impact. Their entrees were also pricier than most restaurants and i felt like for the price, it was a tad too pricey for Tapa dishes too. We ordered a Pork Belly and a Chicken Liver Pate as our entrees. I would recommend coming here as a snack or a light lunch (their lunch menu looked quite good!), but not for a main dinner. For ~4 temaki's, 2 entrees and tip, it was approximately ~$32 per person.

Food: 4/5
Service: 4.5 / 5
Price point: 3/5

Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Omai serves an amazing chirashi packed with uni and a variety of fusion handrolls (temaki) made right in front of you. My personal favourite is the hotate temaki, which is featuring scallop from Hokkaido. 

The restaurant has a counter seating area which I highly recommend. Watch the chef as he prepares the chirashi and temaki. The temaki have some non-Japanese influences such as creme fraiche and maple, which makes it unique but keeps flavours creative. 

This is one of my go-to restaurants on Baldwin!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner with friends and it was a great night! Fits maybe 15/20 people MAX.

We ordered a bunch of the hot food to share and a couple temaki each. I ordered the tuna, tamago (egg), and salmon temaki. I found them to be fresh but nothing especially remarkable. The same cannot be said for the other menu items though--they were fantastic! The pate was so yummy, perfectly paired with the seaweed crisps. The fried chicken was so well seasoned and juicy. But my favourite item was one hundred percent the potato croquettes! Soooo incredibly creamy in the inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside.

Great sake selection and kind servers. Definitely don't take 7 people like I did and just come here with a hot date and get cozy with some yummy snacks ;)"}
{"text":"The hand rolls are really fresh, seaweed is crispy and shipped specially from Japan. And they stuff a lot of fish inside. The place has a really chill vibe, great place to grab a drink and snack.

Appetizers like the artichoke pig belly and chicken liver pate were really good.

Also had the taru sake, which has a great earthy taste.

They are newly opened so still working through some kinks but I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ask any of my friends and you'll know I love me some sake. And let me just say, WOW. I came with a group of friends, curious as to what had replaced ND sushi (an old favourite while I was still in school). Omai is a small, mainly barside, restaurant that is very much like a relaxed, but intimate experience. The seating arrangement and progression is much like that of omakase, where the chef prepares your meal in front of you and hands it to you personally.


Sake was prepared and poured for us and we ordered various handrolls and small plates. The lone hostess was impressively on point, handling all patrons and acting as waitress/busgirl/server all in one for everyone. I had the king salmon, the tuna, and a couple of the specials (scallop and uni). I made sure those handrolls met my mouth at the soonest point in time from when I received them and they were so delicious. Fresh, against the warm rice and crisp nori, the seafood was sublime, perfectly stroking that unending itch I get for seafood, and followed perfectly with the sake.


The hot plates were also very delicious and took us by surprise considering how simple they appeared. I loved the pork belly and the pate plates, but the stew warmed me in ways the sake could not. All in all, a pricey meal, but a special treat that I crave every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Wow what wonderful food we had at Omai last weekend. I'm still dreaming of the tamago temaki with truffle... excellent service, very friendly staff, menu worth making a huge detour for (we came down from Montreal lol) it's obvious each item on the menu was thought about and balanced in textured and flavours. I would definitely return next time I'm in TO."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place  really bad cuz the place looks hip and fun to hang out at night. Small space with a temaki counter if we can call it. 
Great concept on a temaki that could be ordered like eating omakase. 
Heres what i had 
Salmon - nothing great, menu said it has maple, i didnt get any of that flavor. 
Tuna - it was good, but nothing to crave for it, very traditional. 
Shrimp- it was good, the meyer lemon aioli match well with the shrimp 
Tamago- the best and must try, truffle paste. Delicious. 
From the kitchen we had the ff. 
chicken pate this was great, best thing on what we ordered 
Porkbelly- crispy pork with a sweet soy, nothinrg to rave about, but the pickled ramps was good. Plate looks good too. 
Beef cheeks- mild in flavor, persimmon carried the dish. Plate looks nice too. 
Sumomo(sp)- spring summer dish, super light refreshing. I could opt not to get this. 

All in all, 3.5* worth trying but probably wont be back."}
{"text":"Went at lunch, and while everything was great, the salmon temaki was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Great atmosphere, too."}
{"text":"Really great sake bar with delicious mains and well thought out atmosphere. The host did a good job of explaining the dining concept and seated everyone around a center bar around the chef. It definitely reminded me of eating in Japan.

We ordered sake, yuzu saison beer from Godspeed,  five temaki (hand rolls), and two mains. The beer was so unique and really did a good job imparting the yuzu flavor. We'll probably be checking out the brewery in person.

The temaki were good, albeit the ratio of fish to rice was a bit on the small side. Definitely recommend the tamago truffle roll.

The croquettes were to die for. It was so rich but yet wasn't too oily or umami on the palate.

Beef cheeks were soft and tender, well cooked and seasoned, but I'd probably try something else next time.

We really enjoyed the meal and will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Good food at Omai but pricy for what it is. Hip ambiance that's atypical for a sushi restaurant. Worth a visit - Omai is a good addition to the continuously improving Baldwin Street. 

Between 2 people, we ate 6 hand rolls between us. It's great that they can cut them in half for you to share. We tried the specials (uni and scallop) as well as 4 from the menu. They were all pretty good but at ~$6 bucks per hand roll for the menu ones, we thought it was on the pricy side. The special rolls were $15 for the uni, and ~$10 for scallop. 

For the shareable apps...

The yuchoy was disappointing. It was nicely presented but that was about it. A very small portion of diced vegetables on a nice plate.

The croquettes were surprisingly delicious and we ended up ordering two rounds. A nice warm dish to add to the meal.

The pork belly was pretty good too and great to share with a group.

Chicken pate was nice for a starter - make sure to ask for more chips! 

Our bill for 2 which includes 2 drinks came out to $140 and we shared the apps between 4 people. Overall, Omai is a unique experience but I wouldn't come here regularly for my sushi fix. I'll probably make a return though for some more uni hand rolls in the future."}
{"text":"O-MAI GOD

I love this place.

Came to little restaurant twice in two weeks because I simply cannot stay away. 

Dinner service has a completely different vibe, trendy and slightly too loud music (I asked the server if the volume can be lowered and he was very accommodating ), but the food...phenomenal tapas style dishes, perfect for sharing. Every little morsel on the plate was licked clean by my friend and I. 

What made me fall in love with Omai is their uni. This uni is one of the best I've tasted in Toronto, extremely fresh, salty crunchy bits that I cannot identify, but every time I hit one, more saliva just pools in my mouth..and they do not skimp on the portions! So just do it, get that 15 dollar handroll, it'll be the best decision you've made all week. 

Of course, a couple days later I dragged my coworkers back here for lunch so I can get the best chirashi ($32) I've ever had, packed full of uni, sweet scallops, shrimp, pickled egg yolk (I'd a tube of this for take out, squeezed directly into my mouth), the same salty crunchy bits as their handroll, and adorable little snap peas carefully placed, with love. 

Sure, my wallet hurts, but my mouth is in its own personal heaven. My stomach growls for Omai as I'm writing this review, and if you like uni, I urge you to go to Omai, if you don't know what uni is and want to try it, I urge you to make Omai your first uni experience, if you hate uni, you still gotta try Omai because it'll be a completely different experience than that bad sea urchin you had that one time."}
{"text":"I visited this place a month after they opened and it was quite a surprise. The restaurant is cozy, small and dim lit - reminded me of a sushi restaurant in SF. They're known for their temaki so I tried the blue fin tuna - very fresh and simple. Besides temaki, they also have dishes from the kitchen so I would recommend their Soon Bun, Sunomono and Pork Belly.

On the side note, this is a great date spot. Only thing is that I just wish they had more food options!"}
{"text":"Terrible...terrible
Trying to be a ?????? Handroll poor
Sushi rice and seaweed very low quality
Much better to for Korean chefs to stay with Korean cuisine
Not japanese...!!!!!! Stick to what your roots not"}
{"text":"went there right when the restaurants and the staff was very attentive. I would recommend just getting the handrolls and not the snacks. The croquette and sunomono were very underwhelming. I got the wild shrimp, octopus and the tamago. The octopus and tamago were very favourite."}
{"text":"This place used to be Kappo until they shut down. The vibe and interior is totally different and I dig it! Great spot to hang out, enjoy some good food and drinks. No tables, but rather moreso bar style where you sit on bar stools. I got the shrimp, scallop and salmon handrolls (all were delicious as they were very buttery). They cost about $8 on average each.  My friends also got the same ones except they got a tuna roll (which they said they didn't enjoy it much).  We got the fried chicken and beef cheeks to share (really delicious, and moist) would definitely get those items again. Staff were friendly. Great service and experience overall"}
{"text":"Everything we had was very good, but was quite pricey. My personal favourite was the pork belly.  Our bill came out as $80ish but we were still very hungry."}
{"text":"Went here for a work lunch. Very quiet and modern. I throughly enjoyed the chef making our food right in front of us. The Yu Choy and Croquettes were amazing. We ordered almost all of the hand rolls but my favorite was the sea bream over the salmon which is usually my favorite fish. I thought the tamago had a bit too much truffle for my taste but still good. They even let us order a dinner menu item for lunch. Overall it was delicious and I will return."}
{"text":"We were 2 people and ordered 4 temaki hand rolls, 2 sharable dishes, and sake. The servings were pretty small; the waiter actually recommended 3-4 hand rolls per person and 4 shared plates. 

The inside has an open concept, cozy, and dark vibe, good for a date. I found it over priced but ironically cheap as they give you disposable chopsticks... if I'm paying $80-100 for a dinner for 2, is it too much to ask for real chopsticks?!

We tried the ganpyo, wild shrimp, king salmon, and octopus hand rolls; the pork belly and sunomono main dishes; and the server's recommended hot sake. I can't recall the sake's name, it was in a red bottle and had an especially umami taste, which the server recommended was good to drink hot. 

The hand rolls are made quickly and right in front of you (if you sit at the main table). You can ask the server to cut your temaki in half if you want to share! Service was great. Hand rolls tasted okay, some were a bit bland. The pork belly was crispy and just the right amount of fatty/salty. The sunomono was a unique dish of fish roe, octopus, cucumber, shrimp, and julienned zucchini."}
