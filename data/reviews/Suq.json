{"text":"Fresh, exotic flavours I'm a transitional customer from their previous location Teta's. I love the new location, it's modern and open with a chill vibe. Their food is phenomenal and always delicious and fresh. Their new brunch options are such a welcome change to the usual brunch faire. We enjoyed a spicy shakshuka with fresh, steaming pita on the side. Their Ka'ak sandwiches are out of this world with many toppings to choose from. We ordered the Hallomi, pesto Ka'ak.   The Manakeesh is another great option, it's a Lebanese take on pizza and it's heavenly! We ordered the zataar and cheese Manakeesh. Their zataar is so special, it's got notes of lemon and the freshest olive oil to the mix of herbs.   Their humus is one of the best I've had in Canada and I can't leave without ordering a container to go. It's a must try.  Lovely people run the joint and it's got such a great energy."}

{"text":"SUQ Mediterranean Kitchen is a new fast casual restaurant located on the SW corner of Finch Ave East and Champagne Drive. The food is fresh, fast and flavorful. They offer a variety of Mediterranean dishes as well as the best pizza in the East, healthy soups, salads and sandwiches, power bowls, deserts and coffee. This placed opened early in December.  The interior is spacious, clean and dynamic with market products such as baked goods,  hummus, jams and oils to take away after your sit down or with your take-out meal. I had the Siciliana Pizza which was incredible. The dough was light and crisp around the edge with the perfect amount of toppings, served on a long wooden board.  They offer Small Bites for starters including, Shakshuka, Eggs with Soujuk, Lentil & Rice with Caramelized onions, Fatet Hummus with ground beef, Baba Ghannouj, Foul Medamas with eggs, Labneh, Labaneh and Falafel.  There is a variety of Ka'ak Sandwiches including Ka'ak Halloumi with Pesto, Ka'ak Labaneh with Veggie, Ka'ak Halloumi (Greek) Cheese, Ka'ak Kashkaval (Bulgarian) wth Cheese (Ham add on), Ka'ak Zaatar & Olive Oil, Ka'ak Chicken Shawarma, Ka'ak Beef Shawarma, Ka'ak Kebbe, Ka'ak Kafta and Ka'ak Falafel.  Other dishes include both meat and vegetarian items and the coffee is some of the best in town. The Maanakeesh, or Lebanese Pizza would make a Pizzaiolo from Italy, happy.  The owners, Jean and Sami are super attentive and the staff is great as well. This place is a nice surprise and a great concept that is sure to expand as word gets out."}
{"text":"This is where teta's has moved! Solid casual Lebanese lunch spot with amazing traditional sandwiches and wraps. I'm not a chicken person as I usually order lamb but since I'm such a sucker for garlic sauce, I had the get chicken shawarma sandwich which was just so juicy and garlicky and delicious. Their wraps with traditional thin bread(not thick pita) with zaatar and labneh was also amazing. Tabouleh salad was so fresh as if the parsley was just chopped. Their muhalabieh was pretty good too except for me a little too much corn starch as when we took some of it home it didn't really hold form with clearish liquid seeping but great flavor. Their traditional walnut cookie was delicious too. They have baked falafel too but did not get to try it as they were suddenly out of that at the start of lunch...kinda strange...plus the cashier promised garlic sauce with the kibbeh sandwich but we did not get any. Overall highly recommend this for lunch!"}
