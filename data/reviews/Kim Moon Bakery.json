{"text":"This place feels just like a typical HK style dim sum place. Decor isn't great of course but the food is not bad at all. and it's dirt cheap! i heard their egg tart is good but maybe i ordered the wrong one? one i had was three small tarts on one dish, it was a ok. we ordered 6 or 7 items, and majority were decent. i will definitely go back there if i'm in the area."}
{"text":"The best egg tarts I have tasted in a long time - flaky buttery crust, melt in your mouth filling.  This is the place to go for egg tarts, downtown OR uptown in my opinion.  Buy a box if you aren't afraid of an artery-clogging treat.  I cannot comment about any of the other food as I literally have only had egg tarts here.  My partner says that the melon cookies (aka wife's cake in Cantonese) are good here as well, but I have yet to try them myself.    On the basis of the egg tart alone, top marks."}
{"text":"An absolutely pathetic experience. The dim sum is cheap (even for Chinatown standards) but unacceptable. I had shrimp dumplings and I could barely even finished one (out of the 4). Shrimp was clearly not fresh and the skin was poorly done. My friend had some other dishes that I did not try but not visually appealing at all.  As for the bakery goods, these were equally poor as well. I bought a \"wife cake\" and it was a failure. First of all, it was far too oily but the greater disappointment was how poorly done the paste was. I could taste big chunks in it (it should be completely smooth if it is properly done). The pastry itself was mediocre to the very last degree.   Strongly urge anyone to stay away from this place if you want quality dim sum/Chinese bakery goods."}
{"text":"I remember coming to this bakery as a kid, it happened to be one of my Dad's favourites. We'd get a large box filled with baked goods, egg tarts, coconut buns, cream filled buns and the honey-sweetened deep fried noodle buns. Oh so good! I still remember their white boxes with red writing on it, tied up with red plastic ribbon.  Currently the size of the bakery has been cut in half, from what I remember anyway, and there is a bubble tea counter at the front. The selection of buns that are displayed is less than I remember as well.  But I recently got married and all of the Chinese baked goods that my mom wanted me to order for some of our special guests were still available on their order form. I was a little worried with how they would come out, but happily, they passed the \"mom test\".  I'd bet there are some pretty good bakeries in Markham, but I can't seem to find them, or maybe I don't want to since I have pretty fond memories of Kim Moon."}
{"text":"This is me and my bf's go to dim sum place. It has a good variety and serves dim sum all day at better prices than other places. With about 20-22 dollars, the dim sum here can fill us up. Their food is good and service is also great for Chinatown restaurants. I have never tried their baked goods so I cannot really comment on that. Otherwise, I really like this place and always come here when I have a craving for dim sum. It's not 5 stars because while the food is not bad, it's not the one of the best I've tried but for the price it's definitely worth me going back again and again!"}
{"text":"Cheap. Fast. Not crowded.   If you're in Chinatown and feel like going for some cheap dimsum, I'd recommend Kim Moon. You can order 7-8 kinds of dim sum and it will cost you about $20. Nothing fancy and tastes alright."}
{"text":"The papercup sponge cake here is better than ding dong bakery :-) tried and approved!!.... By me :-)"}
{"text":"I have never had a sit down meal here, but I frequent this place for their baked goods and pastries.  I usually buy my favourite items like egg tarts, steamed rice cakes, and sesame seed balls filled with either lotus or red bean paste.  They have one of the best egg tarts, as I prefer the flaky crust versus the crust at other places which has a texture like soft crumbled cookies.  The only criticism that I have about the place is that they need to remove the clutter (i.e. boxes) from the front area, and do some general tidy-up.  That alone is worth the removal of 1 star."}
{"text":"This was my go-to lunch (and occasionally breakfast) stop when I worked at a gallery on the Dundas strip. I still visit with friends for great dim sum and cannot pass by without picking up bbq pork buns. Delicious when reheated (when drunk)."}
{"text":"The dim sum is secondary to the baked goods.  Actually, if you completely ignore the dim sum part of Kim Moon, that would best.  The baked goods are above average, especially for the downtown core area.  Easily the best egg tarts south of highway 7.  They are also one of the few bakeries in the downtown area that carry common Hong Kong bakery staples such as butterfly cookies and neopolitan cakes (made from pastry dough and not bread)."}
{"text":"Cheapest dim sum around and this place opens early!  Second time here and ordered: shrimp dumplings steamed spare ribs minced pork in a dry bean curd  Everything is worth the price here! This place is on par with all the other dim sum places I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is our regular dim sum restaurant. They have been around forever and well known for their bakery as well as decent dim sum at a reasonable price. The family run feel is what sets Kim Moon apart from other run of the mill dim sum joints. It's a comfortable feeling where you won't feel pampered, yet you know that you will be well taken care of once entering the restaurant. There is usually a sad looking fish in a tank to your right as you walk in opposite the baking sitting in display cases well stocked with sweets. Then you walk by the mysterious dumb waiters which look more like elevators for the vertically challenged. I have wondered where the food comes from, the basement perhaps? The dumplings are very good with consistent quality and the noodle dishes are also quite hearty and satisfying. The menu has a few of the typical Hong Kong style of drinks like Horlicks and Ovaltine. We always leave happy and satisfied from Kim Moon Bakery."}
{"text":"Disappointing dim sum and even more disappointing service.  We wanted dim sum on New Years Day and decided to ask people on the street. We bumped into another group headed to Kim Moon and we hitched along with them. Because of the holiday, we ended up having to wait about 15 minutes for a table and by the time we sat down, we were starving and ready to chow down on some delicious dim sum plates.  Instead of the dim sum carts you see at many other places, at Kim Moon you place your order on a card, the servers collect the cards, and you get served as they are ready, like a traditional restaurant. I went ahead and got a combination of classic dishes.  First, the food. I've never actually had dim sum I didn't enjoy. Until I came here. Almost all of the dishes were bland and had almost no flavor. Specifically, the shumai tasted like a lump of unidentifiable, tasteless meat with mushrooms. The fried taro balls were dry on the inside and cold upon arrival. The shrimp in the rice rolls were plump but tasted almost dirty. I felt really bad because out of the five of us, three had never had dim sum and I felt embarrassed that their first time trying such a tasty cuisine was such an awful experience.  Next, the service. Disclaimer, I do believe they were understaffed, but to be honest, dim sum seems like a perfect New Years Day brunch/lunch option and they should've anticipated a larger crowd. While our wait for the table was bearable, I saw many other parties wait for longer than us for a table and they weren't being checked in on by anyone. Our server was so busy, all she had time to do was deliver dishes to tables and dash. We had to get up and flag her down to get her attention to place our order. We asked for some ice water three times before she brought over the cups. I asked about the details about one of the dishes, she said she would ask, and I never got an answer. One of our orders was misplaced, even though I'm pretty sure they just served it to the wrong table and forgot about it. Ten minutes passed between asking and receiving the check.  Overall, a poor experience and I was really disappointed. This is the first time asking locals has failed me and it was just sad. I would've yelped to find a dim sum place in Chinatown, but I don't have an international data plan. Between the service and the food, I really want to give this place one star. However, I'm giving them pity points because they were understaffed, and while the food was not good, it was dirt cheap. Everyone at the table was relatively full by the end of the meal and it cost us about $7 CAD. And the tea pot was always filled on time.  If you're looking for dim sum, I'd skip this place. Honestly.  Pros: menu variety (60+ items), price Cons: food quality/flavor, service, speediness/accuracy, table space  Dishes to skip: too many to count :/"}
{"text":"Aunt grabbed a bunch of baked goods for us.  We were very grateful. The bakery has a nice selection of items. Set up is similar to all other Chinese bakeries. Grab a tray and tongs. Bring your items to the cashier and check out. They have a little dinning area behind the bakery where they offer dim sum items. Tables weren't all that clean, I guess it is Chinatown.  Buns were fresh and had an overall OK flavor. Employees are quick. Don't expect great service."}
{"text":"Occupying the back seating area and upstairs of the excellent and long established Chinatown favourite, Kim Moon Bakery serves up some superb traditional dim sum treats for the discerning    Kim Moon has always been a favourite of mine for nostalgic reasons and because of the goodness of the traditional bakery items that can be had here.  Indulge me for a few seconds while I journey back to fond childhood memories of the eggy-sweet odours wafting out the door on to Dundas, people on the Red Rocket stealing hungry glances at bags of bakery boxes tied with red string that this little Chinese boy carries on the street car click-clacks its way down the street... sigh...  While all the good bakery stuff can still be had here, Kim Moon also serves up excellent dim sum.  The selection does not stray too far into contemporary takes on dim sum but they stick pretty close to traditional fare and are so much better for it.  The mostly older Chinese clientele and relative lack of hipster foodies are testament to the type of food that can be had.  Everything from the har gow, siew mai, char siew bao, curried cuttle fish and the like are done as if they can be no other way.  And that's a good thing! Kim Moon has by far the best deep fried taro balls in all of Chinatown.  Greaseless, delicate and crispy wisps of taro surround the smooth almost creamy mashed taro and ground meat to be found within.    At the risk of letting out Chinatown's best kept dim sum secret, Kim Moon deserves high praise for delivering high quality, old school food at reasonable prices.  It's nice to know that fond memories of yore have not faded over the decades... sigh, sigh..."}
{"text":"When you walk into Kim Moon Bakery, it seems like a typical Chinese bakery filled with breads, buns, cakes, and tarts-- but walk in a little further and you'll see a full dining area in the back serving dim sum! 2-in-1 bonus!  Bakery and dim sum selections were standard and solid."}
{"text":"The buns are okay, not great.  The pineapple buns were dry and a little hard.  Go to Markham or Richmond Hill for better baked goods.  One big complaint is the Hong Kong Style tea with milk. When the lady mixed my tea, she poured the tea out of the glass pot and heated the tea in the microwave.  I wonder how many days the tea has been sitting in that pot."}
{"text":"It's a bit strange to give 4 stars for just one item on the menu, especially considering how extensive their menu is but Kim Moon's egg tarts are the best in the city! And considering they've been consistently the best for the last 2 decades my family has been coming here I think it's fair to give them 4 stars.  In fact, I'm told that as a child I would only eat egg tarts from here so my parents would drive to Chinatown from Brampton or ask friends to pick them up on their way over... I was a picky eater even then.  Kim Moon isn't anything fancy, and I'm not sure I've ever had a sit down meal here or had any thing else on the menu, but whenever I walk by I always stop for an egg tart. And at $0.90 I find myself stopping by often and they never disappoint!  If you've never had an egg tart, they're a custard tart, that's similar to a Portugese custard tart. A swap that was made centuries ago when the Portugese had colonies in Asia I think tho I'm not sure who influenced who.  Kim Moon's pastry is exceptionally flaky and the custard is set well and flavourful. Not too sweet, not too soft or runny, and the perfect egg to vanilla ratio... maybe it's nostalgia but I think they're the best egg tart I've had in Toronto and potentially anywhere with the exception of Hong Kong."}
{"text":"Very good cream buns, shrimp crackers and puff pastries. Their bakery isn't that nice looking though, the one across the street looked better. It looks kind of sketch to be honest. Some of their buns needs major work. I'll stick with Mashion bakery."}
{"text":"This place was really good back in the day around 20 years ago but sadly alot has changed over the last ten years.  To start things off, the owner sold the place to a vietnamese woman who is not really friendly.  They have tried to revamp it but the taste of the food just isn't the same.  I remember coming here and it was bright with all the flourescent lights, now it's just a darkened version and if you are an old school chinatown alumni it just isn't the same.  I remember this place used to have a machine that would tie pastries inside a box.  It was really cool because afterwards your box would be wrapped criss cross with red string.  Red is an auspicious colour for chinese people.  The pastries used to be really fresh and they would constantly bring out stuff from the dumb waiter used to move food between the first and second floor.  I don't even know if the second floor is used anymore.  They converted the front to a bubble tea section.    If you are coming here for nostalgia purposes just keep on walking.  If you are new to the neighborhood it's worth a try but don't expect to be wow'd."}
{"text":"I come here for the coconut buns. They're really tasty. Sometimes I get the cha siu buns too.   70-80 cents each. A perfect cheap snack between meals."}
{"text":"The best  da'an ta available in Downtown Chinatown.  The BEST sesame balls (LOTUS).  OMG.  Woman behind the counter can be scary but we have known each other for a long time and she's nice to me now.  (Thankfully LOL). They have a yum-cha restaurant at the back and a lot of elderly Chinese patrons go there for late breakfast or early lunch.  Their curry cuttlefish is always nice and I always have the stuffed vegetable dumplings.  Pass on their char siu bau.  Always a surprise piece of chewy fat somewhere in there but the fluffiness and lightness of the dough is pretty authentic.  This is not a fancy place but a good place to go to when you are running errands in the city and it won't cost a fortune either."}
{"text":"I had some really good food here. The dim sum are really heavenly and the milkshakes were pretty good. What appealed more was the home vibe from the staff. You could tell this was a family business and the two friendly ladies made our visit very comforting. Again, absolutely loved the dim sums (especially the shrimp ones)"}
{"text":"This place use to be the best.  I remember coming from mississauga as a kid and always getting two boxes of buns for my family...but now a days...not so good.  The buns aren't as fresh and the dim sum is poorly executed.  I've had so many shrimp shells it's a little crazy....  Honestly try Mashion Bakery around the corner a lot better and cheaper!  But remember their buy 1 get 1 free deal...oh that was amazing! If they brought that back I'd probably go again!"}
{"text":"Five for the  sponge cake!  Really the best i've had so far in TO.  But not more than 2 for  the restaurant such as dim sum.  Not a nice place to dine in, clean but dodgy looking.    Will return for sure but only for spongeeeee cakes!"}
{"text":"ALways a must stop when I go back to Toronto.  Great Chinese baked goods and cookies."}
{"text":"this place serves ALL DAY DIM SUM. that means, dim sum for dinner. yum. the prices are reasonable ($1.50-$3). and the food is reliable, very traditional style and tastes good.  the servers speak English, as well as Cantonese and mandarin. fast service. Egg tarts are top notch. they open around 7am - close at 830pm everyday."}
