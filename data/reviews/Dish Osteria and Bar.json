{"text":"I used to live on the same street as Dish six years ago (wow, I'm old), but I never went inside. I was a broke 19 year-old Pitt student and this place always seemed like a haunt for sophisticated adults who know the proper way to hold a wine glass.  But yesterday, I finally visited with a friend from NYC. I wish desperately that we had tried the food, but we only had time for a drink at the bar.   It was everything I thought it would be. And what was that? I don't know! There's something about the ambiance here, from the candlelight  to the beautiful, ornate ceiling typical of a lot of  pre-war South Side buildings that just makes you feel like you're somewhere special."}
{"text":"Maybe my favorite restaurant  in Pgh. Everything  i've ever tried is just dedicious, and the service is good, too.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Food was good, nothing to write home about.  I don't think the menu has changed in years.  Price was reasonable and the atmosphere was terrific!  The special (which I had) was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night - had heard of this place but didn't know where it was located and was pleasantly surprised to find it in the Southside off the beaten path. I'm not much an italian-food lover but this place has changed my mind. I ordered the duck - and it was absolutely amazing! Our waiter was fantastic - helped guide us to some of his favorites while explaining some wine pairings. The ambiance was warm, inviting, and still intimate. I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Way over-rated. My husband and I were spending 1 night in Pitts.  We had tickets to a Pirate game but decided instead to spend an evening at Dish.  Who could argue that decision?  As we sat at the bar we were only slightly distracted by the flashing police lights outside.  Apparently some serious crime had occurred in the hood as the police shut-off several streets.  No problem , we had a glass of wine and along with other patrons, pretended nothing was wrong. The service was acceptable  - far from outstanding, and the food was really unremarkable!  I had the special and it was anything but special.  There are several Italian restaurants in my small town that are way better and far less expensive. Take a pass on this one."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Pittsburgh. The owner is 1st generation Italian, from Sardinia who is warm, personable and really cares about each customer and their satisfaction. Everything I've had is great here. The octopus, razor clams, fruiti di mare and tiramisu are particular highlights."}
{"text":"Just FANTASTIC!!!  The food is out of this world! Plus an added bonus for me is the staffs knowledge of celiac disease and making sure my food is gluten free. I absolutely love this place and recommend it to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"This place is not good. They don't execute the basic fundamentals of cooking well. Put this restaurant in NYC and it wouldn't last a month but here it has almost five stars--mind boggling. If you like an overcooked pork shop and a management team that likes to talk about bs rather than make sure you have good service (or good food(, go here for sure."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place that serves delicious food late into the night.  First room has a bar and a few tables... through there is a second room all for dining with a window view to the street.  Unpretentious, authentic, tasty Italian.  Sea Scallops were perfect."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, have some reservations though. Went on a Monday night for dinner with a friend. We split a Brasciole appetizer, which was excellent. I then had a Rigatoni Bolognese entree. The sauce had nice flavor, but the pasta itself (not the sauce) was lukewarm."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for Valentine's Day last year and we both fell in love....with the food. The gnocchi is to die for. It's pricey but the romantic decor, unique cocktails and excellent food make it the perfect place for a night on the town."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great food. Great service.  A little cramped inside but who cares. Those giving less than 4 stars are crazy and most likely are part of the Pittsburgh crowd that prefers cheese whiz over actual cheese on their food."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong by going here.  Food and drinks are absolutely delicious! Staff are knowledgeable and attentive.  It has been a while since I have been back but not because I don't desperately want to!  A great out of the way (off Carson St.) place to have a very nice evening out.  Quiet and cozy atmosphere, yummy cocktails and wine, and of course delicious food.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I mean...what can I say? I had high expectations. And with the prices, I expected more. But my food was not that great. I ordered the gnocchi and while it was pretty tasty, it was just...average. It was sticky, the way pasta dishes can get the next morning when you microwave leftovers. The meat/cheese plate appetizer was good, but pretty sparse I thought. Plus, you are crammed into this restaurant like sardines. It's very noisy, which surprised me.   Dessert (chocolate macadamia tart) was yummy, as well as my drink! But I wouldn't return here in a hurry."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! The fresh seafood and pasta dishes are simply delicious. You can't visit Dish without trying the scallop appetizer. One of the best features of Dish is the extremely accurate sommelier. She willake your taste buds do dances with her pairings. My wife is a vegetarian and they are very accommodating for her when there is nothing on the menu.  The owners are the nicest people and use old world family recipes over culinary concoctions. The bar can get crowded and a little loud, but the dining area is perfect for an intimate occasion. This is my go to place for valentine's day and anniversaries."}
{"text":"The entire experience was exquisite, between our wonderful waitress, the delicious food, and precious atmosphere it was definitely a hidden gem in Southside's scene.   Definitely order the seafood!! Super yum."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Botched my attempted reservation and was unapologetic about it.  Claimed. could not understand my phone message.  They only take reservations by phone and have to leave a message.  They provide no.other option.  When I suggested they join the 21st century and take reservations over the Internet they said they saw no need.  I'm thinking the owner still rides a horse to work.  Deadly combination of rude and ignorant.  Would give zero star if possible.  Don't go here."}
{"text":"One of the best-kept secrets in Pittsburgh. Heavy on seafood done with Mediterranean style, the food is incredible. From tapas to full dishes, you really can't go wrong. The desserts and wine-list as equally as good as the food.  The part that pushes this place over the top is the staff. The owner is truly dedicated to making sure every guest is having an the best dinner possible. All of the servers are warm and friendly, the service is impeccable. The decor/size of the place is very cozy and intimate. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Exceptional Italian food for anywhere, not just Pittsburgh. Somehow manages to have terrific seafood, despite its landlocked location.   This is what a casual fine dining restaurant should be: cozy, dimly lit, excellent but unobtrusive servers, terrific food. Plus I love that they keep some bar seats and tables open for walk-ups. It gets very crowded on the weekends, so I recommend reservations, or going on a weeknight."}
{"text":"It's rare to find an Italian restaurant this wonderful. The owner's committment to authenticity is admirable -- they use the best olive oil (either Sicilian or Spanish I was told by the owner) that I've ever had in an American restaurant.   Quality ingredients and preparation. Why can't other places understand this?   Where to begin...the carpaccio of tuna with super fine shaved/julienned fennel: AMAZING. The ricotta gnochi; fantastic. The frutta di mare- type pasta also delicious.   I also really like the atmosphere, the spare polished tables and perfect lighting are conducive to a very comfortable dining experience.   Reasonably priced wine list with some unusual Sicilian varietals is much appreciated. The servers are fantastic, also, offering tastes of wines and very knowedgeable about the dishes.  Dish, how we love you!"}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant! Atmosphere was great. Wine selection is superb, and the calamari appetizer was delicious."}
{"text":"Dish was amazing. The atmosphere was very romantic and intimate. Friendly and fast table service. Small and full bar, perfect for happy hour after a hard day at the office. The food was fantastic. An eclectic environment for the college date, or date night for mom and dad. A must try."}
{"text":"Horrible service, lying owners!  I made a reservation for graduation and was left stranded the day before.   After confirming 2 weeks earlier that our reservation could be modified to accommodate 8 people, I received a call the day before our reservation, stating that they had no recollection of that conversation and that our reservation could only accommodate 7. The owner claimed that he had told us that he couldn't do 8, which is simply not true! We would have cancelled the reservation if that was the case!  On our way to pittsburgh with no reservation during one of the busiest weekends.   Completely disorganized and unethical service!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here, the bar is great but the food is even better!  I took my girlfriend here a week ago and the service was fantastic!  We sat at the bar and our bartender Alyssa was excellent.  She made excellent wine recommendations for my girlfriend and my old fashion was delicious.  I will be back here and will try to imitate their scallops with saffron cream (I will most likely fail). i love this place"}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that you could walk by several times and it would never stand out.  Nothing fancy on the outside but the food and service made up for it.  We started out with the scallops and were not disappointed.  I was a little apprehensive about the combination of scallops and beets but the work well together and the scallops were cooked perfectly.  For the main course we both tried the fillet.  At medium rare I did not need a knife to cut through it.  Dessert (peach cake) was every bit as good as the appetizer and main course.  Service was excellent.  As this was our first time here, our waitress made some great recommendations and completed the dining experience.  It was also nice to see the chef come out of the kitchen and talk with some of the regular customers."}
{"text":"Damn, this place is good!..  Ate here on the recommendation of a colleague while on a business trip... Holy cow, this place is great!..  Dim and romantic atmosphere...Full bar with a great cocktail menu...And the food is fantastic!..  It was a cab ride from our hotel, but we will definitely stop here again!.."}
{"text":"Dish makes me feel like I'm back in New York!!  Wonderful!  By far this is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Every detail was perfection.  The food is real authentic Italian.  My bf and I visit regularly.  Oh and to finish the perfect pasta dish and bottle of wine...the lemoncello cheesecake is to die for."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian seafood, quite and dark light. Seafood spaghetti and seafood risotto is so delicious.  Worth to book a reservation!"}
{"text":"I must confess, this review does not take into account any food quality/taste, ambiance, or service criteria. But based on the conversation I just had with their hostess, I don't care how good it is, I will never eat here. After an attitude-filled greeting, she informed me that my preferred date (admittely, a popular date, but I was a month early, there was hope) was booked and there was \"like, no way \" they could seat a group of my size (5) until 9:30pm. We had older people in our group, so I asked if I could be put on a waiting list and I got  \"Siiiiiiigh. I guess. I mean, if you want. But we never have people cancel. We're very popular, you know, and very small.\"   Wow. Well, forget it then. Snotty hostesses are very pre-recession. If you don't want my money, or at least make me feel like I should want to spend money with you, I don't want to give it to you. Really, hostesses at restaurants that book a YEAR in advance (like Volt or Le Bernadin) have never been that rude to me. I'm very disappointed, Dish. I heard good things..."}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance and really good food! I found this restaurant so pleasing to both eye and taste bud.  Given we had reservations on a weeknight, there was no hassle getting seated and attentively served.  The daily specials change frequently and offer some unique delights.   We started the meal with Bruschetta.  It looked so appealing-piled(but not \"Oh man I am making a mess\") with mushrooms and fresh herbs (basil and surprise! mint). Again going with the theme of \"looks NOT being deceiving,\" it tasted good.  Next, I oped for two items from their daily specials- Chilled Potato, Fennel &Leek Soup and Pan Seared Scallops with leeks, parsley, tomato and olives (oh! Both dishes were 'enhanced\" with black truffle oil! Yum!).  I loved the soup-different ingredients combined for a smooth, light dish.  My date had the wild caught Shrimp sauteed with olive oil, garlic, white wine, cherry tomatoes and parsley.  All dishes were of the Antipasti categories and were filling enough for dinner.   Great place...cool tin ceilings, open, uncluttered dining space with tasty food. Will be a repeat \"offender\" for sure!"}
{"text":"my birthday dinner was amazing! we had the eggplant appetizer, the rigatoni plate, and an incredible gnocchi special. the waitress made me feel special and the cocktails were perfect. the dirty dish martini (with gin for me), and a sazerac. highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife, brother and parents for a special occasion. We had not been here in over 8 years and glad to see it was still as good as remembered.  We are all native suburban Pittsburghers that now live in all over the U.S.  We had a few drinks at the bar before dinner.  The place has a much better than average beer and wine selection for its size as noted in other comments.  Everyone gave high marks on their entree.  My pasta was perfect.  Great atmosphere and experienced waitstaff.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"Excellent experience...  It's a treat to have a professional waiter, I felt very welcome here. Everyone in my party of 4 enjoyed their meal although I should note among us we only had two different dishes. 2 of us had the pasta special with prosciutto and a mix of mushrooms. We thought the pasta was perfectly cooked and the mushrooms were an unusual and very tasty variety. The other 2 had the gnocchi special with bolognese sauce. They reported the gnocchi were light and fluffy in contrast to the often gummy texture you find at some restaurants. It wasn't cheap but it was worth the money. I can't wait to go back though the cost will require it to be only an occasional treat."}
{"text":"If you want to wait to be \"hand picked\" to get a table, come here.   My boyfriend and I have been coming here for 1.75 years and bout 1.00 years questioned it.  We've been here generally w ourselves but also w a birthday part.  Everytime w a reservation we've still waited an hour.  We've even watched people get seated before us.  Better looking people.  It's clear that the maitre de (who is the owner) Seats to his preference - he always says u can eat at the bar.   It's a shame."}
{"text":"Went there for my wife's birthday. Excellent choice and great dining experience. This is a small neighborhood upscale restaurant on the Southside. There are maybe 15 tables max with some in the bar area and the rest in the next room. We called and made a reservation for a Tuesday night but didn't really need one. I'd highly recommend reservations for the weekend.   Food was absolutely superb. Quality ingredients. Wonderfully prepared and the menu had some creativity. The wine list was OK but I didn't expect much for a small restaurant. They do have a fully stocked bar though and offer beer cocktails(?). Very different. Had not seen that before. Our waitress was pleasant and very knowledgeable.  Dish is a wonderful, small Italian restaurant and I highly recommend it. SO MUCH BETTER than the routine fare you often find on the Southside. No complaints other than parking (there is none) so plan some extra time to find a spot."}
{"text":"Dare you to find a more consistently excellent restaurant. Meals are a steal in my opinion."}
{"text":"Five of us had a wonderful meal here last night.  We began with the antipasto platter and bruschetta with homemade ricotta, delish, wish they were a bit bigger.  Hubby had swordfish, nice portion and cooked perfectly. Kids all had pasta dish, the rigatoni with peas and pistachios and the gnocchi--all were pleased and stuffed afterward!  I had the panzanella salad and grilled shrimp--had an amazing red sauce!  We had three desserts--lemon cheesecake, chocolate bread pudding, and tiramisu,  I couldn't tell you which I liked best, all fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Cool little restaurant in an interesting area. You get crammed Ina a little and so don't expect too much space! Good menu and service and the place had a nice vibe. I had pretty high expectations and the food didn't quite reach that level. Nothing really wrong with the cooking but neither was it exceptional. It just felt like a million other Italian restaurants in which I have eaten. Nice place though."}
{"text":"First timer to Dish.  It was crowded for a Wednesday, most likely because of the holidays.  We managed to get a seat at the bar after 10 minutes.  To get a table was an hour wait.  Happy Hour was a dollar off the bar appetizers which were good.  The beef tenderloin app was perfectly cooked to a medium rare as specified, but could have used a little seasoning.  Our wine came, the Barbera was very good.  BUT as I am a bit of a wine snob, my friend and I couldn't help but notice how terrible the glassware was.  The red wine was served in standard white wine glasses and filled so high that you could not swirl it and smell it.  Our main entrees came out at a reasonable time.  I ordered one of the specials, a tortellini in brodo.  Good, but not as good as what my boyfriend makes.  The broth was rather bland, but the pasta seemed freshly made.  The highlight that I would go back for in a heartbeat was the mushroom risotto.  It was full of flavor.  I'm craving it right now actually."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the city! Has been for years. Love the carpaccio appetizer. The pastas are always amazing, the fish cooked to perfection, the atmosphere so warm and inviting. Can't say enough about Dish! Try everything!"}
{"text":"We visited in November. We were very happy with our meal, the ambiance of the restaurant and our server. We had a cocktail at the bar first which was very good and the setting was comfortable. The restaurant is small ,it feels intimate not crowded. Our food was delicious. I had the scallops. The risotto was amazing also. The service was great. When it came time to leave we had trouble getting an uber so our waitress ,Jaime, ordered a ride on her Lyft and then stood outside with us making sure that it came. How nice is that ?!  All in all it was a wonderful dinner and experience and we will definitely return when in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"It was OK. During our three day stay in Pittsburgh a number of people recommended this place. It was a nice surprise to see so many people and the nicely decorated place amid the kind of questionable buildings and homes in this section of Pittsburgh. The restaurant was kind of noisy and the music was too loud. This clashed with the fine dining experience I was expecting, having read the menu. I know that loud music is a \"thing\" in restaurants nowadays, but it didn't fit in here.  The bar area was very busy, and we wondered why we had to wait until 8:30 to get a reservation since there were several empty tables in the dining room that were never filled. Also, it was too dark and I had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu. The three slices (for two people) of cold ordinary bread was a disappointing start. Our Negroni cocktails, however, were the best we ever had! Very oranage-y! We ordered the antipasto for two, and admittedly it was delicious. Nice selection of meats and cheeses, but a little skimpy I thought. Not even one olive on the plate.  The main courses themselves were very good, as was the wine we chose, but nothing to write home about. Just Ok, like it said."}
{"text":"Really, really, great food.  Small and at times crowded, and we all hate trying to park in the Southside, but the food is top notch and worth it.  For an appetizer if you see Polpo alla Griglia on the menu GET IT, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a bit standoffish coming here as, since it being Italian, I immediately feared it would be your typical run-of-the-mill water-ed down Americanized cuisine. Boy was I wrong. The venue is located a few blocks off East Carson, the main drag in a quieter area. The venue does seem a bit cramped when you walk in and unlike most of the sports bars on East Carson there were no flat screens where I could watch the Steelers game that was on at the time. Take into account that this was a little after 5:00pm so it had just opened and wasn't that crowded.  I ordered the Polpo alla Griglia, grilled octopus salad, the sardine, which came with two whole sardines with raisins and toasted pine nuts, and for dessert, the tiramisu. The octopus dish was delicious as was the sardine dish. Although the bones were a bit annoying, the dish was still divine as I loved how the bitterness of the sardines went with the sweetness of the onions, raisins and pine nuts. The tiramisu was easily the best I have ever had. It was so moist but not at all overly sweet. During my meal I also got to chat with some other clientele seated next to me one of who was also a food and restaurant connoisseur like me.  I think what separates this place from all the rest in the area is it's locale, it's interior and how it lacked the televisions thus only seeming to cater to those interested in the venue and the cuisine, and it's authenticity in that there seemed to be nothing Americanized about it...pure Italian. It's unfortunate that all I ordered were two appetizers and dessert. Next time around I'll have to try an entree."}
{"text":"Great intimate atmosphere followed by a great food and wine selection, topped off with 5 star service. I was there last night an stick with some of the specials. Started with the grilled calamari and I have zero complaints. Great for dates or intimate conversation. I highly recommend Dish."}
{"text":"Visted last night with close friends for our annual holiday night out. All agreed it was the best experience we have had in Pittsburgh! Every aspect from the service to the food was spot on. Best way to judge a meal is by the empty plates / bowls following each of our appetizers, main course and desserts. We plan to visit again!"}
{"text":"Dish is a nice change of pace from the action on Carson street. I never expected to find a warm, classy spot like this on the South Side. The owner is great and actually comes out to mingle with customers!     Both times I've been here I went with a small group of friends, we ate a meal, entrees+desserts and then got drinks at the bar.  The food is good, the desserts are in.cred.i.ble.   Absolutely Yummy!!"}
{"text":"There's not a lot to say except that Dish Osteria is the perfect dining experience.  Beautiful and cozy little nook of a restaurant, wonderfully knowledgeable servers, the cook comes out to make sure you love what he's made and I sure did, I got the Grigliata Mista di Pesce and I have never had seafood prepared or presented more deliciously or beautifully anywhere else in Pittsburgh.  By far my favorite restaurant at which to splurge.  Oh and it is really easy to stay and enjoy one too many of their fantastic cocktails at their intimate little bar.  In love."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what all the hype is about! I finally made to Dish Osteria for dinner and my best summary of the meal would be it was ok.  We had made reservations and when we got there had to wait for our table, was offered comped desserts, but that never came to fruition. For such a small restaurant the service wasn't attentive and at times its seemed like we were just waiting.   PS...if you are dining with a vegetarian they were willing to make ZERO accommodations to their menu and had only one option...I hope they like mushrooms!"}
{"text":"I came to town for business, and found this place on Yelp. This was my first time here, and I hope it isn't my last. The atmosphere was so delightful; small but not too cozy. The service was the perfect amount of attentive but not intrusive. And finally the food was fantastic! I had the Mushroom Soup and Rigatoni alla Scamorza, and I was really impressed with the quality and taste. This would be such a great date restaurant!! Great job Dish Osteria!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, each time finding the food unbelieveably delicious!  The last time I had the linguini ai frutti di mare, a seafood dish with saffron cream sauce.    The feeling in this petite restaurant is one of low-lit intimacy, perfect for a cold evening, close to your friends or date.  Now that they accept credit cards, you don't need to let your forgetting to stop at an ATM hinder your enjoyment of the delicious starters, desserts, etc."}
{"text":"I have been three times, the first was just apps and drinks - FANTASTIC! The second was a wonderful dinner, I had no complaints and couldn't wait to go again. The third, awful. The seafood didn't taste fresh and everything else was overcooked or bland. It was a weeknight - so perhaps the JV team was in the kitchen? I have to give a three for the semi-consistency. I will go again - but not if I am paying for the bill."}
{"text":"I came here last summer with my friend in July and I was stunned by their specials menu, it was almost all in season and outnumbered the selection on their house menu. The bar is so well stocked, they have amazing house cocktails, I had the lavender lemon vodka martini and it was amazing. The wine list here is also very nice and the wait staff is pretty knowledgeable about wine pairing.   I do believe we started out with the bruschetta with mushrooms and also the meat and cheese platter (i think). I remember that what ever it was that we started out with it was going to be an amazing meal.  I had the filet mignon offering paired with perfectly grilled asparagus, mushroom risotto and the red wine reduction. The meat melted in my mouth it was so tender and perfectly cooked (rare/medium rare) and with each bite the asparagus, with the meat, with the risotto, and a little dip of the sauce was out of this world delicious. I could not stop smiling as I devoured the entire plate and washed it down with a very nice red wine (pinot noir or cab sauv).  I notice people have been commenting about the wait to get a table, I had no such issue, waited a good 20 minutes while I enjoyed my martini at the bar. Also Italian food typically is not vegetarian friendly, so don't expect this place to have too many vegetarian options available. Lastly I thought the price was extremely reasonable, considering they bring in everything fresh.   The restaurant is very small and tucked away, which adds to the appeal--at least for me. Nice ambiance, good staff, fabulous food, fresh ingredients, amazing cocktails, this place is hands down probably one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I went to Dish nearly three years ago but think of it often, as it certainly is a gem tucked away in an unassuming street corner.  I visit Pittsburgh often but have a terrible sense of the direction in the city, so whenever we're on a street similar to this, my eyes scan the corners for Dish.  The service we experienced was outstanding - friendly staff (without being overly present and overbearing at the table) with great knowledge o the dishes, each dish that we ordered truly lived up to and surpassed expectations.    Overall, a humble location but right-sized space - there would certainly be lines and special reservations needed for this place if in a bigger city.  Perfect for an intimate dinner for date night or close friends."}
{"text":"This is the absolute primo restaurant I have been to in America ...other than those many wonderful ones in italy. The menu is perfect, staff well versed, atmosphere intimate, albeit a bit noisy... I am so disheartened that it is closing soon, and that it has been on my bucket list for years.  Therefore, lesson learned, \"don't put anything off you wish to do...\"  Ce vediamo Dish Osteria. Xoxo"}
{"text":"Visiting the Burg for a few days this past weekend we decided to give Dish on the south side a try.  Being from this city and knowing the lay of the land I never have very high expectations for a restaurant there especially an Italian one at that.  This said, I was blown away as Dish is simply that good and for sure one of Pittsburgh's very best.  Overall food, service and ambiance amazing for a little joint nestled on 17th street in the heart of the south side.  The parking truly sucks but that is to be expected in this part of town.  The food including pasta, steak, apps and desert all best in class.  This little gem would do very well and flourish if plucked out of Pittsburgh and dropped on to Manhattan island.  Woohoo - we now finally have a restaurant to look forward to when visiting my home town."}
{"text":"Wow, what a place. Closing down and when we tried to get a table the one owner was more focused on having fun and pleasing his other guests than help us. He seemed to have it out for the group I was with for some reason. I saw him laughing at us as he spoke to his bartender. Ya, this review really doesn't matter because it's closing down but the owner clearly showed how unprofessional he can be today. We did nothing to him. Very confused. Whoever you are, sir,. You're an asshole -- someone who really looked forward to trying your food."}
{"text":"Not crazy about the pasta dishes here, meh for the prices (if you want to charge East Coast Italian restaurant prices, you need to serve up East Coast Italian restaurant excellence).   Come for an expensive yet slightly mediocre dinner BUT stay for the excellent collection of grappa, the homemade desserts, and the most authentic cappuccino I've had west of New York City! So yeah, we end up coming and staying at the bar with dessert and drinks rather than a sit-down dinner."}
{"text":"Dish is probably my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! I've travelled to Italy 6 times and this restaurant is as close to being in Italy as it gets! Michele is a superb chef and very personable! He made my experience at his restaurant feel like I'm at my grandma Philomena's! I will keep coming back for the food is fabulous and authentic and Michele is like hanging out with mia familia! I only wish I lived downtown or on the Southside; I'd be there every night!"}
{"text":"We visited Pittsburgh last week for my 31st Birthday and booked Dish Osteria as our dinner spot. The restaurant is very cozy. Seating is limited, so I would suggest a reservation. The dinner menu changes daily, but overall, expect scrumptious seafood, pasta, and salad. First of all, the bread is delicious and fresh. We enjoyed snacking on it before receiving our antipasta  and salad. We ordered the Insalata Mista della Casa; the salad was the perfect blend of peppery and crisp greens. I would highly recommend ordering it. Both of the antipastas we requested were the standouts of our meal. The Carpaccio di Manzo literally melted in your mouth. The beef was incredibly fresh and sliced to perfection, and the Reggiano was a nice touch. The cozze was the best bowl of mussels either of us have ever devoured  (and I make mussels regularly at home). The taste was somehow delicate and full of flavor simultaneously. I can not imagine a better way to start off your dinner than with these two dishes. By the time we ate our main courses, we were already drunk on the flavors Dish Osteria has to offer. I ordered the Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare. All of the shellfish was fresh and cooked to perfection. The spaghetti was a firm al dente, which is exactly how I prefer it. Amazing dish. My husband ordered the Saltimbocca di Vitello. The meat was delicious, but somehow the least impressive part of the plate. The butter potato gnocchi was seriously Heavenly! The texture was like fluffy marshmallow, and the flavor - buttery goodness. If I could eat it every day, I would. The brussel's sprouts were sauteed well and incredibly flavorful. Overall, our dinner was an incredibly experience, and if we lived in Pittsburgh, Dish is a place we would dine at regularly.  We will remember our dining experience at Dish Osteria for years to come. It was simply delicious, and the best restaurant we visited while in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Dish Osteria is one of the best dining experiences I have had since moving to Pittsburgh.  The food is very well prepared and literally everything was delicious. We had the spaghetti frutti di mare, the rigatoni and the grigliata pesce. You could not go wrong with any of these and it will be hard to decide which one to get next time. The service was very attentive but not annoying. The only bad thing is the lack of nearby parking but it's definitely worth the extra effort!"}
{"text":"Want to escape the madness of Carson street? Not into sport bars? You'd like a cocktail or a glass of wine in a cool, lively, somewhat more upscale place? Dish is for you.   Foodwise, we only tasted their shrimps since one of us was hungry, and they were very good. We then focused on the drinks. Long wine list with more than a few italian wines, and a shorter, but decent cocktail list. The sazerac and lemon drop martini were fine, and very reasonably priced, although the martini was too sweet for my taste. That said, this is not the most interesting cocktails I have had in Pittsburgh.  The space is pleasant, although the tables and seats near the door get a lot of fresh air when it's cold outside. The crowd is diverse, the majority perhaps in their early 30s. Noisy, but you can still talk to people. Mix of people eating and others drinking.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"Went here for a special occasion. The ambiance was very warm -- a perfect location for a date night.  I was so impressed by the authenticity of the Italian food and the quality of the ingredients. I still dream about the scallops with saffron cream sauce. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Cozy if you can get a seat in the back, if by the door you will freeze to death. I wanted to like this place but it was by far the worst meal I have ever had in a restaurant . We had to leave before we vomited."}
{"text":"I came upon this place while traveling on business because it was listed in Pittsburgh Magazine's 2014 best restaurants.  Sat at the bar and had a lovely conversation with the bartender, who is also training to become a sommelier... so she knew her stuff.  Had one bocas plate (meatballs) and the house salad.  Considering how cold it was outside the meatballs were a perfect order, then the salad lightened things up before my entree.  I ordered Grigliata di Pesce which was essentially a hodge-podge of delicious seafood all brough together by polenta and eggplant.  I'd definitely recommend it!  The owner came by, which convinced me to stay after dinner for a drink.  The owner, myself, and some of the staff all had a long, friendly conversation.  Everyone that works here is so personable!  Would definitely recommend for a date, a nice dinner with friends, or on a night where you just some good food and good conversation."}
{"text":"Really nice. I was looking for a good Italian restaurant. The homemade tagliatelle was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is by far my FAVORITE restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Having eaten at a number of places each time I visit the city of Pittsburgh, I have not yet found one that even comes close to how good the food is here!  Not only does the food rock... but the ambience is gorgeous and great for any occassion.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!"}
{"text":"Dish has great atmosphere and wine, and the food is good. Of the Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh, it's arguably the best. When my work has people visiting from out of town, this is the reliable standby. It's also a good place to celebrate a birthday or romantic occasion. Definitely try the shrimp in garlic sauce if you go. The rigatoni with pistachios is also amazing."}
{"text":"Dish has always been one of my restaurants in Pittsburgh. Their menu changes often and never disappoints. Just recently we celebrated two birthdays in my family with dinner here and had such a wonderful meal. Our server was attentive, fun and friendly which always makes for an enjoyable experience. We had the meatballs and calamari for appetizers - both excellent choices. The prosciutto wrapped veal was cooked perfectly and the rigatoni with smoked mozzarella I had was delicious! Thank you, Dish for another great meal. With all of the new spots in town I still love visiting those tried and true favorites!"}
{"text":"Another great Italian restaurant in the South Side.  Wasn't crazy about the meat and cheese dish appetizer but our pasta entrees were excellent.  Very good tiramisu also so don't skip dessert.  Equipped bar with beer on tap and a separate adjacent room for the dining area.  Even so you don't feel too far away from the bar.  God forbid.  Small enough for a romantic dinner and large enough for a family meal.  Enjoyed it immensely!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, the wait staff is friendly & efficient, and the price is reasonable. Best restaurant in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a business trip and all I can say is that it was awesome. I had the seafood pesce-the right amount of fish and it was all good. The bread and oil was a nice starter, but we also had the  meat and cheese appetizer. My friend ordered an excellent light Pinot noir like wine. I am not A big desert fan, but the chocolate bread pudding was great."}
{"text":"It is a great place for Sicilian fare, very delicious! Intimate atmosphere. Not a great place groups since the place is so small."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a Wednesday evening, and I must say, I never knew this place existed and now so happy that I do.   Atmosphere: The restaurant is the perfect size. It's not overly large, but it's not tiny either, but could easily fill up with a few large parties or several couples. It's super dim, though, so if you do not enjoy eating in the dark, then you may want to find a table with many candles nearby. Otherwise, it's adorable inside, updated but modern and fresh. Also, since this restaurant is on 17th and off the East Carson path, you don't feel as though you're in the middle of the Southside dealing with every college kid that just discovered alcohol.   Service: The servers and owner (who I got to meet) were wonderful. They know the menu and also care. I think due to the size of the place, it's manageable for them to not be overwhelmed and spread thin.  Food: Let me tell you ... I had the Butternut Squash Gnocchi with Boar Ragu and I'm still thinking about it. The gnocchi were absolutely fresh and probably the best I've ever had. They melted in my mouth and I did not want them to end. The boar ragu was also incredibly fresh and the pairing was something I would have never been able to produce in my own mind. I'm being dramatic, but I truly enjoyed it and I made that apparent by eating every last bite and then licking up the sauce on the plate with leftover bread.   We finished with the chocolate bread pudding and it was the best decision. It was a little more like a molten lava cake and a quick bread,  so it was not overly \"pudding\" esque. My opinion is that if a restaurant has bread pudding as a dessert, then you should get it cause it's probably amazing. Few places dare make bread pudding because either they know some people see it as outdated, but nowadays I feel it can be so unique. The only other place that rivaled this option was NOLA... they used to have a red velvet bread pudding that may be one of the greatest desserts I've ever had, but I digress.  I'll definitely be adding Dish to my \"nice night out\" rotation!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm-hum. This review is for drinks and dessert. Which should be enough for you to get an idea because it was for me!  Dish is fannnnncy but I think the service, food, ambiance, furniture, etc. are all in accordance with the price.   The bar is copper. Probably not to the core but it's copper colored or plated! Pretty and shiny! I had a ginger old fashioned. Highly recommended over their sazerac which was just okay.   The chocolate bread pudding was really really good. Hot but not dry, spongy but not gummy, and topped with chocolate sauce and fresh, delicious blueberries. Eating blueberries in February is cheating but if no one hears about it then it's ok. They were like tangy gifts from Mexico. The fruit kind.   Next we asked for espresso Martinis but I kind of wanted just an espresso and maybe another drink. Next time I won't have a coffee martini. I feel like my brain was confused by the chemical combination, like, I'm tired! Noooo I'm up! Nooo I'm wired! When all I ever really was was full.   The dinner menu looked great too. Many options for all diners. Maybe will try again on a visit to Pittsburgh. It will have to wait some time but the place comes highly recommended so it won't be forgotten."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian Fair! - one of the few places you can get carpaccio in Pittsburgh, it could use capers to add the saltiness needed by the greens, but it is still stellar.    The owners are GREAT, they take good care of their patrons (offering to give my date an umbrella due to threat of rain...  She was amazingly attractive, but I think they would have done it for anyone who looked dismayed by the storm clouds).  Their bar is well stocked and even if you do not like 14 y.o. single malt Oban, Tawny Port, or Amarone; they have a great tap selection...  They have Framboise and Guinness on tap, making it possible to feast on a Red Velvet while eating the best tiramisu you will find outside of NYC.   While it is hard to not order the Grigliata Mista di Pesce, their recent special of lump crab/sea scallops/shrimp in a creme saffron sauce over fresh made pasta was to die for.  The meal started out very good, and as I worked my way to the bottom of the bowl, the mass of crab that had been marinating in the saffron creme was so good I nearly died.  I had been drowning in my date's stunning blue eyes until that point when the flavors on my tongue caused all else in the world to temporarily cease existing as absolute perfection embraced my palate.    Will be back, hopefully next week!   Quasi perfetto!"}
{"text":"(this review was from march 2012)  Great food! Nice cozy spot. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service! Which is why i gave it 3 stars. But lets talk about the food. Had the carpaccio and mussels for appetizers. So good! For our entree we had the filet mignon (cooked perfectly) with mushroom risotto was perfectly cooked but was a little bland, and a side of grilled asparagus. There's nothing like the taste of grilled veggies. Nom nom nom. The BF got the duck with fried yucca balls smooth n creamy just like a gnocchi.  Service: for a highly raved and the amount of money we are willing spend.. I expected the service to be at least good. I don't like writing bad reviews but the service was so poor. It was our first time there and the waitress didn't go over the menu like she did with the other customers. I remember saying we're not sure what to order because it was our first time.. And her response was \"oh, I'll give you a minute and I'll come back\". Once we ordered, Not once did she ask if we wanted another glass of wine. Our glasses were taken away from us before we could order another drink.. Seriously? Whenever she'd ask us \"how is everything?\".. And before we could really answer she would walk away and she did this more than several times throughout dinner. She seemed very disinterested in serving us and I'm not pretentious by any means.. But seriously??? It was not an enjoyable experience... The food was amazing but the service just ruined it. I DON'T THINK I'LL BE GOING BACK. 1 star for service, 4 stars for food.."}
{"text":"I went there with my boyfriend for the first time last night.  The service and food was on point.  The caprese was delicious, the mozzarella melted in my mouth.  I ordered the fish dish that came with scallops, shrimp, seabass, and risotto which was heavenly.  The only negative about this dish was the sea bass, which was a bit chewy.  But I didn't even mind because everything else was amazing.  My boyfriend ordered the rigatoni and that was equally delicious.  I don't even like rigatoni, but I loved his dish.  Our waitress was so friendly and helpful.  She made great suggestions for drink pairings. It was overall a great dining experience.  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic Italian food.   It is a pleasure to eat here and fun!"}
{"text":"The highlight of our what should have been 4 hour but turned out to be 8 hour drive to Pittsburgh for the holiday was Dish.  We love the innovation of the food, the friendliness of the staff, and that it is itself a gem in a very underrated and cool city.  We loved to duck ragu over house made pasta, the grilled sardine and great wine.  The menu is always fantastic!  Go to Pittsburgh and go to Dish!"}
{"text":"After many recommendations, I was very disappointed.  This is the type of place that I feel people brag about because they feel they should.  It's a different type of restaurant than you're used to in Pittsburgh.  It has a really nice feel inside and the fact it is hidden away in the Southside adds to the charm.  The problem is the food is pretty average.  I'm usually not picky about Italian food as it is pretty hard to mess it up.  Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.  When you're paying as much as this place charges you better be impressed by the quality, which I was not.  The staff was very kind and courteous, we didn't have a long wait to be seated or to receive our food.  This just isn't the type of place I'd recommend as you can find better quality food else where for a much better price."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem just a few blocks off of Carson.  Parking is a hassle, but once you are parked you will have a great time.  I got the spaghetti Bolognese with Brussels sprouts.  It was near perfect.  Come to think of it, I should come here more often."}
{"text":"The food at Dish is phenomenal!! I had a great experience. The waitresses are very attentive, and the food is delicious. The only thing I would change is the loud atmosphere. Try not to get a table near the bar. Also, the restaurant had bad lighting. I will definitely come back when I visit Pittsburgh again...."}
{"text":"Very good and cozy Italian restaurant.  Had a delicious octopus appetizer, which had a great grilled taste and texture.  Also enjoyed a shrimp appetizer, as well as a pair of great pasta dishes.  The gnocchi with Bolognese was excellent although a tad overcooked, but not so much that it diminished it.  Homemade panna cotta and tiramisu were both great as well.  Overall, very tasty and I would not mind trying it again for some more items, as there were several good looking options on the menu."}
{"text":"Dish is the neighborhood Italian joint that everybody dreams of, but only exists in Woody Allen movies. Well, here it is in the most paradoxical of places, the South Side of Pittsburgh. Walking into the tiny restaurant is like entering the old Hollywood of Frank Sinatra and Bette Davis. The lighting is very low, with only flickering candles to provide illumination. Patrons sip martinis at the bar and chat intimately around small tables while jazz plays softly in the background.   Complementing the ambiance at Dish is its authentic, delicious Italian cuisine. From seafood to pasta to steak, every menu item I've tried has been flavorful and expertly prepared, free of the excessive grease and cheese that ruin the experience at so many other \"Italian\" restaurants whose food has been Americanized beyond recognition.   While the atmosphere and food at Dish are fantastic, it does have a few drawbacks. Chief among them are the sometimes snooty waitstaff, and the prices, which for an underemployed twentysomething like myself mean eating here is an infrequent treat, as opposed to the weekly outing that I wish I could afford. Bottom line is, if you're in Pittsburgh and have a few extra dollars to spend, go to Dish. You'll love it, I'm sure."}
{"text":"We had a family dinner here while visiting out U of Pitt student.  Everyone enjoyed it - adults and teenagers.  Menu is large and varied enough for everyone to find something they like without reading like a greek diner novel.  Good wine, priced well for a fine restaurant.  Not very large though so some may feel squashed and there is no parking to be had.  We cheated and used the valet at another restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good first date place. Try the bruschetta it was awesome. Menu simple but very good!"}
{"text":"Dish was probably one of the best dining experiences I've had since moving to Pittsburgh.  While located in South Side, it's comfortably removed from the chaos of Carson St.  The actual restaurant is a small, dimly-lit European style place in the first floor of a converted row-house.  As soon as you enter, you'll notice a fully stocked and nicely decorated bar area equipped with tables for those unable to make a reservation.  In the back of the restaurant there are 15 or so small tables.  Overall the restaurant is quite cozy and has a very intimate vibe.    We started our meal out with the mushroom bruschetta, which consists of three different types of mushrooms served on ciabatta bread.  The appetizer was prepared fresh, brought out relatively promptly and was excellent.    For the main meal I had the Rigatonia alla Scarmoza sans prosciutto.  This dish is essentially a rigatoni pasta dish with smoked mozarella, peas and crushed pistachio nuts in a heavenly Parmesan cream sauce.  The pasta was simply out of this world.  My girlfriend had the Grigliata Mista di Pesce which consisted of salmon, calamari and eggplant.  She recommends this for the fish lovers out there.  We capped our meal off with pumpkin flan: two thumbs up.  All this food with a couple of Peronis to wash it down...probably one of the best meals I've had in a good while.  The service was fantastic and I appreciated their willingness to accommodate us despite being 20 minutes late.  Give yourself extra time to find parking...  Look, this place is pricey and probably isn't somewhere you'd visit often; however, if you are looking to go out for that special occasion, definitely consider it.  You will not be disappointed.  Just be sure to make reservations well in advance; I'd say at least one week or so."}
{"text":"Marvelous food and attentive service.  I love the intimate ambiance and the attention to detail.  Dish is very welcoming, and their food is wonderful.  Parking can be a hassle, there's lots of on-street parking, but much of it is already full, so leave some time to deal with parking.  For my entree I ordered the Stuffed Pork Rib Chop with Gnocchi and Brussels Sprouts, and it was great.    Wonderful restaurant restaurant for conversation and enjoying good food."}
{"text":"This place is right in line with some top New York Italian eateries  - the food and atmosphere are top notch. The bar side is cozier with a better vibe than the dining area, but both are good. Reminds me of many great places in New York. It's my go-to with out-of-town guests."}
{"text":"This is gonna be another one of my long-winded reviews, so if you're in a hurry I'll sum Dish up for you in one word:  FANTASTIC.  Full disclosure: I have lived in the Southside for 5 years and have always heard from friends and locals alike that Dish is an experience to be had.  Unfortunately, I just never seemed to make my way there until last night when we were able to secure a 7:15pm reservation for 2.  I will say that choosing to dine on a Monday night definitely worked in our favor, because from previous reviews it appears their weekend evenings book at least a month out.  We arrived around 6:30 to grab drinks at the bar and wait for our table.  The bartender was pleasant and answered all of our questions, as well as made a few recommendations.  I started with a Dirty Dish Martini ($9.50), garnished with gorgonzola stuffed olives.  Yummy!  It was made very well and went down a little too easy!  We crept closer to our reservation time but I decided to order one more drink - the Branca Mule ($9).  I love a good Moscow Mule and was intrigued by Dish's twist on this foolproof drink: made with lemons instead of limes, as well as Maraschino.  This drink was a bit strong for my tastes and I found it a tad bitter... I would probably not order it again, though I'm sure any cocktail connoisseur would enjoy it.    The maître d' stopped by the bar and let us know that he was ready to seat us, but that there was no rush for us to pay our bar tab... I have always loved the Italian pace of life and Dish echoes that to a T.  I imagine that they are a bit more rushed on weekends, but this particular night was relaxed and at our own pace.  There was no hurry: the only place we needed to be was right here, right now.    Our waitress brought over water and the menus, and we decided to order the beef carpaccio ($11) and Melanzane ($9.50, grilled eggplant topped with buffalo mozzarella, basil and balsamic).  Both were delivered to our table within minutes, and I have to think that their simple, refined menu is important in kitchen turnaround time.  Both appetizers were phenomenal, easily shared between two people, and light enough that I wasn't dreading ordering a full meal afterwards.  For our entrees, my dining partner ordered the gnocchi with sausage in a tomato sauce, and I settled on the rigatoni served with cream sauce, peas and prosciutto.  It wasn't long after our appetizer plates were cleared that the waitress brought us fresh bread with an olive oil+balsamic dipping oil and a few moments later, our entrees.  My rigatoni was so outstanding that I am still thinking about it today and wondering how soon I can get another reservation.  The gnocchi was fantastic too -- normally I steer clear of red sauce in restaurants because being raised Italian with a secret family sauce recipe has refined my palette maybe TOO much.  Most restaurants serve sauce that is either too sweet, too saucy, etc... but Dish's sauce almost brought a tear to my eye. It tastes EXACTLY like the sauce my grandmother perfected and shared with all of the ladies in our family.  The sauce that I spend hours in the kitchen making every few months... This whole time, it's little Italian twin is mere blocks from my front door!  I was under the impression that the owner and the head chef here are both from Italy, and it shows.  From the relaxed pace of your meal to the refined tastes you will experience, I would recommend Dish to anyone and everyone looking for a fantastic meal in the city.  We finished off our meals with an order of the tiramisu and a slice of lemon cheesecake, both of which are made fresh by the chef's mother-in-law! I don't even like dessert, but this cheesecake was so, so good.  When the checks came, I was pleasantly surprised:  2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, a glass of wine and a bottle of San Pellegrino:  $85.  Not bad at all, considering some other reviews had me prepared to spend $85 on my share of the bill alone!"}
{"text":"I'm SO sad that this beautiful restaurant has closed.  I heard so many wonderful things about Dish and had been meaning to come here for months. For Christmas, I purchased a gift card for my mom, which we had planned to use in May, but had to rush to use when we learned that they would be closing their doors at the end of April. My parents and I came here on April 14th (Good Friday). I arrived at 4:30 pm without a reservation and there was a hefty line out of the door. We were able to find 3 seats at the bar when the doors opened at 5:00 pm. The bartender was outstanding- she worked independently and was able to make everyone's drinks at the bar, in addition to the people waiting for seats, in addition to taking everyone's food orders and keeping track of tabs, etc. It was truly amazing seeing how fast and efficient she was. My mom ordered their specialty drink which had citrus and thyme in it. We then both ordered mojito's which were delicious (arguably the best mojito I've ever had!). For an appetizer, we started off with the Gamberi- Sautéed wild Gulf shrimp in extra virgin olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, crushed red pepper and parsley. WOW. The shrimp was so juicy and so tasty. Our bread was next- again, unbelievable. It was so fresh, and tasted so good dipped into the olive oil and vinegar, as well as the sauce that came with the shrimp. For our entrees, we ordered:  Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare- Spaghetti with scallops, mussels, New Zealand cockles clams, calamari and wild Gulf shrimp in white wine, extra virgin, garlic, parsley, tomatoes and crushed red pepper. (my dad ordered)  Rigatoni alla Scamorza- Rigatoni with smoked mozzarella, prosciutto, peas, roasted and salted pistachio nuts in a cream sauce with Reggiano, fresh ground black pepper and parsley. (my mom ordered)  Pappardelle ai Funghi- House made pappardelle with Portobello, shiitake and cremini mushrooms. Brussel's sprouts shallots, garlic and extra virgin. Reggiano and basil. (my entree)  Wow, wow, and wow. I was so impressed with all of the entrees. The amount of seafood that came with my dad's entree was incredible. He loved it and thought everything was so fresh. My mom's was my favorite out of all three- the rigatoni pasta was the most perfect al dente pasta I've ever had and the sauce was SO good. It was a heavier sauce so she couldn't finish the meal, but it made for some pretty tasty leftovers the next day. My entree was light, but PACKED with flavor. All of the mushrooms and the brussel's made it so tasty- it almost was like a classier version of haluski, meaning, I adored it. Of course, we had to order a desert as well. My co-worker insisted that I try the panna cotta, which we did. It was the first time I have ever had panna cotta and let me tell you- I was not disappointed. It was creamy, thick, and so delicious. It wasn't too sweet, which I really loved.   While we were waiting for our entrees, the executive chef/ owner, Michele Savoia, came over to us, introduced himself, shook our hands, and talked about his restaurant. What a special experience. He literally noticed that we haven't been there before and made an effort to introduce himself and thank us for coming. How genuine and thoughtful. He described that this restaurant is closing as a way to give himself a break, and that he is confident he will return to the Pittsburgh restaurant world someday. I am hopeful that is true, because if so, I will be first in line at the new spot. This place was incredible."}
{"text":"we did not have a reservation and waited FOREVER for a table. that said, they let us sit at the bar and get mussels while we waited. we had the option to eat at the bar, but wanted a table. service at both the bar and our table were amazing. all the dishes going by were gorgeous. i got a seasonal softshell crab dish and my girlfriend got seafood pasta. both were absolutely beautiful and delicious. my meal was $16 and hers $20, if i remember correctly. impeccable service, beautiful atmosphere, classy music, and UNREAL food. 5 star restaurant for 3 star prices. cannot recommend enough. great spot for a date.  also, we did not have dessert, but we were watching it go by and oh man if it tasted as good as it looked..."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Delicious cocktails! Great atmosphere. Great vibes.  I still fantasize about the seafood alfredo."}
{"text":"I ate here this past weekend with my girlfriend and her father for dinner.  We called 2 days prior to our visit in order to try and get reservations at 7 PM.  It didn't exactly work out for us since it was a weekend night and we ultimately decided on the 6:30 PM reservation whenever that or a 9 PM was offered instead.  I can't say that I have ever really noticed Dish before even though I have to have been past it before.  It's a fairly nondescript building on a corner a couple of streets off of Carson.  We arrived right around our dining time and were told that we would have to wait a few minutes for our table.  The restaurant is pretty well divided into two different areas with one side of the restaurant being the bar and the other side a dining room.  Whenever we walked into the dining there was only one other couple inside and so I ended up being confused about our wait other than trying to get us to order drinks.  At least it wasn't a long wait I suppose.  The dining room itself was fairly small and I think that it could maybe seat 30 or so people.  Overall the whole restaurant was pretty unassuming and the only real thing that I noticed about the dining room were some bottles on a shelf on one side of the dining area.  For dinner we all decided to split the Crostini alla Scamorza which was toasted ciabatta bread with smoked mozzarella, prosciutto, mushrooms and fresh basil while my girlfriends father also opted for the pasta e fagioli.  While we were waiting for the soup and appetizers to come out, they provided us with some pieces of bread as well as an small vessel that had some balsamic on the bottom and olive oil on top.  It was good but I was surprised how much of a bite the olive oil had in it.  After a short amount of time both the crostinis and soup were delivered.  The crostini looked like a cheesy bread but ended up tasting more like a cheesy bread on steroids.  While the tops of the crostini were covered in delicious prosciutto and cheese, the mushrooms on top gave it some good earthiness and the basil a good flavor.  Sadly there were only three crostinis as I am sure that I would have liked some more of it.  For our dinner entrees I ordered the Tagliatelle ai Funghi which was Fresh tagliatelle with shiitake, portobello, oyster, pioppini and cremini mushrooms in extra virgin and garlic with spinach, basil and Parmiggiano Reggiano while my girlfriend went with the Linguine ai Frutti di Mare.  Whenever they were brought to the table I thought that the portions looked a bit small but the bowls ended up being deceiving as they were deeper than they looked.  My girlfriends dish came covered in many different types of seafood which you would expect and tasted really good.  Mine was also excellent and I loved that the noodles were cooked al dente and were a bit denser than I had been expecting.  It also carried much of the same flavors that I so enjoyed with the crostini and before long there was nothing left on my plate and I was full.  My girlfriend and her father both commented on how much they enjoyed their meals and we all left satisfied.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be heading here again in the future.  I like that almost everything about it is low key and yet it still provides excellent food while also being cheaper than I had originally expected."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Dish.  We always sit at the beautiful bar.  Rae Lynn is a master bartender and always suggests/pairs the perfect drinks to go with our food.  She's a gem.  I had the Pappardelle con Funghi Selvaggi. Outstanding!  Fresh and delicious.  House made pappardelle with Morel mushrooms, locally foraged chicken of the woods, fresh English peas, shallots, asparagus, garlic and extra virgin. Reggiano and basil.  My husband had Costata di Maiale. Pan roasted pork rib chop stuffed with prosciutto di Parma and smoked mozzarella .  It was served with sage and butter potato gnocchi and sautéed rainbow chards.  We ate every bite,  It was that good.  Thanks Dish for starting out my birthday weekend with a delicious bang!!"}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite Italian I've had in Pittsburgh. The service was impeccable, the atmosphere was very nice (perfect date place but also great when I went with a small group of friends), and - most importantly - the food was out of this world. I got a pasta dish with mushrooms that was by far and away one of my favorite meals I've ever eaten. It was so simple but the ingredients were fresh and interesting. And the mango cake I had for dessert was equally excellent...light, full of succulent mangos, and with the perfect level of sweetness. Sadly, due to the price, this will be limited to a special occasion destination but I really look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"I recently had reservations here that I (very sadly) had to break :( But, this place is amazing!!!  The last couple of times that I was @ Dish, I was so pleased with my meal and total experience that it remains on my list of Notables in Pittsburgh!  :)  You will want to revisit Dish over and over!!! The entire restaurant and bar has a great ambiance and its very nice to share a date with your sig-other or friends.  PARKING:  Traditional Southside... it blows."}
{"text":"Without Yelp, we would've never found this place. It's pretty tucked away. I didn't see a parking lot so we parked on the street about a block away. Coming from the Wexford area, it took about 40-45 mins because of traffic and detours. You Pittsburghers have some crazy streets (especially through downtown).   Got there, we didn't make reservations, and sat in the bar area. The lady that took care of us was friendly. I ordered the pork rib chop and my friend ordered the lamb gnocchi. My chop was accompanied by brussels sprouts and gnocchi. The pork chop was a tad overdone - it was a little tough. The brussels sprouts were good but I didn't expect them to be thinly sliced/shredded. I have never had gnocchi until that night. I don't know how I feel about it yet. However, my friend says that's what good gnocchi is suppose to be like. Not chewy or rubbery. I guess I'll have to trust her judgement!   They had a full bar but they could use a bigger wine list.  I would like to come back to this place when we're not in a time crunch and let you guys know."}
{"text":"I normally don't post reviews for too may things, but tried this place out back in February when I was in town for business and the food was very good. The place seemed pretty busy when I was there, so I was really surprised to see that it's permanently closed when looked them up on this trip. Glad I was able to experience it before it closed down."}
{"text":"Stands out in Pittsburgh, serving real food in the heart of south side. Great wine and cocktail menu. Food excellent. Staff are knowledgeable. Great atmosphere - will be back again."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me so long to come here! Our 1st wedding anniversary was the perfect opportunity.   I knew we were going to love it when the dipping olive oil and bread was outstanding! We started with the grilled eggplant, which was good, but as someone that doesn't LOVE eggplant, it probably wasn't the best choice. I think if you like it you'll love this dish.  Next up was their seafood pasta. Which was pretty much perfection. The sauce was one of the best I've ever had! It was a perfect balance of every flavors in it! The seafood blend was just right.   I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here and didn't sit down till 11pm. Great food. The short rib gnocchi was spectacular. Great bartender too. Tasty craft cocktails and superior food. Will make this place a regular stop. Kudos"}
{"text":"I've travelled the world for my job.  Dish ranks in the top 10 places I've ever been for overall best food, cocktail, and atmosphere.   Be sure to get to know the owners, servers and bartenders... All incredibly long tenured and interesting people.  Bravo"}
{"text":"Dish is crowded, dark, and loud. It's full of people who are young, particularly by Pittsburgh standards. It's a New York quality Italian restaurant, run by real Italians. The food is excellent and the wine list a good compliment. Our pasta entres last night were wonderful, as was the chocolate bread pudding desert. Service is professional, and New York brisk. Overall it's always been a great experience. The only downside is that, like New York, there's nowhere to park on the south side, so you can walk off that desert hiking to your car."}
{"text":"The food is good Italian with a but of a modern twist. The service is always excellent."}
{"text":"A little off the beaten path in the southside is a true gem.  The place is tiny and making a reservation is definitely the way to go.  Everything we had was delicious and the service was great.   A win for sure.     We started with the anti-pasta dish.  This contained a baked ricotta that was the star of my evening.  I could have eaten an entire plate of that alone.  So yummy!  The other items on the dish were yummy too - Giardiniera, roasted red peppers, marinated olives, caper berries and prosciutto di Parma.  This was followed by the Rigatoni alla Scamorza - Rigatoni with smoked mozzarella, prosciutto, peas, roasted and salted pistachio nuts in a cream sauce with Reggiano, fresh ground black pepper and parsley.  The portion was on the smaller side for a pasta, but it was plenty filling and I actually could have eaten less than the whole thing (which I ate because it was so good).  It was really nice combination of flavors and textures that I would definitely order again.    Stuffed as I was after dinner, I couldn't skip the dessert, so I took home a piece of the lemoncello cheesecake.  A little too lemony for me, but probably the best textured cheesecake I have ever had."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there on St. Patrick's Day and this place was amazing! The food was phenomenal.  Tiramisu was to die for!"}
{"text":"What!?!?  Super fresh pasta . Good beer. Good cocktails beeeeeotches! This place is awesome . Sat at the bar and loved the Gnocchi... Made fresh at the restaurant.  Had a old fashioned... Also great. Ray Lyne at the bar makes a great drink.  Best pasta I ever had.... No shit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Italian food in Pittsburgh. I could eat the rigatoni every day! The ambiance is romantic and the servers are super nice. I frequent here with my lady often."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was slow.  Try the calamari, you won't be let down.  Atmosphere was perfect, it was quiet, dimly lit and perfect for conversation.  Be sure to make reservations, this place is small.  I will definitely be going back here again."}
{"text":"There's a big difference between good Italian and bad Italian and Dish is a great example of GOOD. I had the Pan Seared Sea Scallops and Rigatoni All Scamorza and was just blown away. I don't remember everything else we got at the table, but between four people, 3 who are hard-core Foodies (the other was a dietitian), everyone was pleased with every bite.   They have a good selection of wines too. The Primitivo was a big hit at the table.  Not a huge place, but big on taste and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Found this place out of the morass of Carson St nightlife (on a Friday night no less), and we can't imagine finding a nicer random pick -- we're only in Pittsburgh for one night and had no prior knowledge of the place. It has the feel of a slightly upscale but neighborhood place, with a dozen or so tables in one room, and a few two-person tables in another room with the bar. We were seated immediately (it wasn't crowded), and the entire staff was super-friendly and attentive. Our waiter (hi Scott!) was quite gregarious, and offered us tips on both good venues for after-dinner drinks as well as highlights of the city to catch the next day.  We each had a glass of the standard Merlot -- entirely adequate but I make no claims to wine snobbery.  We ordered a grilled eggplant appetizer with Buffalo mozzerella and basil. It arrived within minutes, and disappeared into our bellies just as quickly. Delicious."}
{"text":"Once again, I am shocked at how people love someplace (at least in my opinion).  I will admit that the reason I chose Dish for our anniversary is because so many people rave about it and we wanted to go somewhere different than our norms for our special day. That being said, I wish that I could go back and change my choice to do so.   I want to add, the service was good.  Nothing amazing or spectacular, but she was knowledgeable, nice and did make a good wine rec.  She gets points there.  Other than that and one good app (the egglplant thingy), the experience quickly went downhill.    My steak, ordered medium, was actually still alive and very chewy.  However, I tried to deal with it as I am not \"that person\".  The Brussel Sprouts were the high point of my meal. No one actually ever asked how the steak was (I always thought these types of establishments were supposed to check and make sure things were cooked appropriately... not like I would have sent it back though).     In terms of dessert... did not even want to try it as I was already disappointed.  Off to Pipers Pub we went for that!   All in all, if I am going to spend $120 on something I could have done better at home, I do not think it warrants a good review (and that was not including the tip even)."}
{"text":"Wow, this restaurant is incredibly tiny.  Do not come here if you don't have a reservation.  The restaurant is set a few blocks off of Carson in a converted row home.  It's very cozy, the lighting is very dim and overall pretty romantic.  Parking can be a challenge.  I looped the block several times before I could find a spot on the street anywhere within four blocks.  I was a little surprised because we had a 6:30 reservation on a Friday evening so it's not like we were competing with the late night crowd going out to the bars in the Southside.  I ordered the linguine ai frutti di mare minus the shrimp and it was really tasty.  Usually, there isn't a ton of flavor in this dish when it's a white wine and olive oil sauce but this was surprisingly flavorful.  Also, I can be iffy on mussels but these and all the shellfish were cooked perfectly.  For dessert, I tried the chocolate bread pudding.  It was more like a slice of chocolate bread and it was decent but not great.  The meals were a little pricey but nothing too shocking.  Also, the service was good."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect Valentine's Day meal. Service was on point - attentive, knowledgeable, and pleasant. Food was, as always, spot on. The rigatoni with peas and scamortza was perfect and the filet was perfectly cooked and delicious. Will be back..."}
{"text":"Dish is my go-to restaurant in southside. The menu is ever-changing, showcasing a real passion and understanding of the food and taking advantage of seasonal ingredients. The staff is accomodating and loves special requests and off-menu orders. Not to mention, this place is adorable. Dimly lit, intimate, and romantic. Make sure you make advance reservations, they fill up fast!"}
{"text":"Good ambience, somewhat slow service. The waitress was very nice! The food was decent, and worth the price. Not the most spectacular, but decent nonetheless. Cocktails are average. Good place for a nice intimate dinner, but doesn't exactly stand out over other decent restaurants."}
{"text":"My fella has treated me to many sexy dinner dates around Pittsburgh, but this charming little 'hole in the wall' two blocks away from our Southside apartment is by far my absolute favorite.  If I actually wrote paragraphs here I would write forever so I'll do bullet points.  -Candlelit and romantic atmosphere.  Not too trendy.  Not \"old yinzer\".  Just simple and romantic. -Absolutely superb service.  Every bartender and server we have had here has known their stuff with the wine, liquor and food.  A lot of wonderful personalities on staff as well. -Perfect noise level for an intimate night out.  Not too quiet and stuffy, not too loud. -Easy to make a reservation. -Ever-changing menu, so you can always try something new. -Gorgeous cocktail menu.  Lots of creative drinks on there. -I have only had the tiramisu as far as desserts because it's so dang good I don't wanna ever leave without it. -The quality of the food is amazing.  So fresh and light.  Every fish dish I've had has been the highest quality.  The pasta is the real deal.  No \"Olive Garden\" sauces here. -NO TVs IN SIGHT.  Thank god. -Get the cheese board. -The price is UNREAL.  Our first time here we got a bottle of wine, the cheese board, an appetizer, two entrees, tiramisu, and two espressos... it was about $200.  I couldn't believe it.  GO TO DISH.  But not too much, cause I still wanna be able to get a table!"}
{"text":"I am a harsh critic of Italian food and I don't eat Italian out of the house often. Mostly because I look at everything on the menu and think, \"I could make that\" or \"It won't be as good as Grandma's\" or \"It won't be as good as in Italy.\" But everyone told me I would love Dish, so I came here with my parents for my birthday. We all agreed that it was outstanding, and I have since been back for a couple of special occassions. It's easily one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  The pasta is always cooked perfectly al dente. My favorite is their homemade gnocchi. They do a mean bolognese sauce, and anything with seafood is always super, super fresh.  What I really love about Dish has to be the antipasto, though. The carpaccio is done in a very traditional style with arugula and parmigiano reggiano, and I'm also a fan of all of their salads. My favorite was a fennel, beet, and blood orange combination. And, I'm saving the best for last...the grilled eggplant with mozzarella di bufala is an absolute MUST. Orgasmic. The first time we came here, we loved it so much, we ordered a second plate of it. They use a 15-year-old balsamic vinegar on it that's perfectly sweet and sticky and of course the mozzarella is super creamy and oozing with milk. Sorry, I'm drooling all over my keyboard right now...I would be happy eating this every day of my life.  Excellent desserts and drinks, too, and perfect service. All around, a great, authentic Italian restaurant. The only thing it's missing is...dare I say it...pizza. We need more places that make authentic pizza here, and I bet Dish could show Pittsburgh what's up."}
{"text":"Omg, where do I start?!??!   My buddy and I were in town for business and I saw this place on Andrew Zimmern so decided to give it a try.  We sat in the bar area and It was very cool.  The place is situated in the middle of a neighborhood, and if you don't know where you're going, you'd never find it.  The bar was small but fancy....Also quiet.   We ordered beef carpachio and tuna tartar for our Apps.....SU-LAMMING!!!!!!!!!!   BEST I'VE EVER HAD!   For dinner we both had a pasta dish....His had a white sauce and tasted like bacon, mine had a red sauce and had anchovies among other things in it.   BOTH WERE DELICIOUS!!!!  PASTA IS FRESH!!! I can't remember the names....for dessert they had pumpkin flan.... .AGAIN, IT WAS BANGING!!!!!   5 STARS FOR THIS PLACE ALL DAY LONG!!!!!   Pittsburgh, ur very lucky to have this place in your back yard, get your asses down there and give it a try!!!!"}
{"text":"These places are always worth coming to during the week, if you can to avoid crowds.  I got the Grigliata Mista di Pesce and it was amazing!  I'm a big seafood eater and was growing tired of the usual salmon, halibut, and sea bass, so I'm really glad that Dish offered something different.  The main fish was blue marlin on top of saffron risotto and it was really perfect.  Surrounding the fish were shrimp, scallop, squid, eggplant and their special asparagus and it was delicious.  Absolutely worth the time and money.    I also followed with the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.  It was another excellent choice."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, good atmosphere.    We started at the bar. I began with a Rossini which was berried puree and Prosecco. Then I tried a lavender lemon drop martini and this was my signature drink for the evening.   I started with the melanzane grigiliate con mozzarella di bufals. It was a nice sampling of eggplant, mozzarella, red peppers, and mushrooms. I didn't eat the prociuto. He started with the calamari which was really nice and not overly fried which is pretty common for calamari.  For entrees, I had the gnocchi alla Norma with eggplant, nice red sauce, local's cow milk ricotta, and fresh basil. Wonderful pairing. He had the tagliolini di mare allo zafferano, he thought it was fantastic. Being our last night in Pittsburgh, we had to splurge with dessert. We shared the tiramasu and panna cotta. I never had panna cotta and didn't really know what to expect, it was wonderful but a bit too rich for me. Most of it was left unfinished.   I cannot believe I never heard of this place when I lived in Pittsburgh. They have been open for 11 years! Quite a treat nestled in the South Side!!"}
{"text":"I love Dish. Great food, great atmosphere, friendly staff. Everything you're looking for in a small independently owned restaurant.   You know it is authentic when it is hard to understand someone's Italian accent despite hearing the Pittsburgh dialect all the time. From pasta to cocktails this place has put their finishing touch on everything.   This is the kind of place that I like to bring out of town guest to. It can charm the pants off of anyone who truly knows how to enjoy a meal.   I'll be back for more, so you better make sure you have a reservation or you'll be out of luck on any given night of the week."}
{"text":"Excellent, very personal service; seated promptly. I ordered the rigatoni with a cream sauce and prosciutto, which was incredibly tasty. The quality shows in their handmade, change by the day menu. As a visitor to Pittsburgh, it was tough to find parking since so much around the restaurant was designated residential. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Reservations are recommended. Dish has to be one of the better restaurants I have been to in a long time in Pittsburgh. It ranks right next to point brugge, bona terra, and toast. I recently tried spoon and salt of the earth, and dish tops them both. I had the scallops for an appetizer which were perfectly seasoned and cooked. The duck breast for dinner was excellent. The sweet reduction on the duck wasn't too overpowering and the mushroom mixed polenta on the side was just the right pairing. I would definitely recommend this to others."}
{"text":"New Years Eve is probably the second most overrated night to go out of the year, behind Valentine's Day (as well as the mythical Sweetest Day for the Ohioans out there), which means reservations are a necessary for everywhere you go, and expect a price increases across the board.  Lucky for me, Dish makes New Years just another day.   With a menu that changes by the day, it seems, you have to be willing to trust in the skills of a chef, and know that you're not looking for old stand by dishes.  Between myself, the CFO of my life, and our two friends, we took a bit of a stroll around the menu.  Starting with a razor clam and scallops app, while our friends had a quail over a corn fritter.  It was all good.  Their house bread is fresh and delicious, and great to dip into all of the various sauces you'll run into during the course of a meal.    Due to my sad puppy eyes, I was able to sample all of the food on the table, and I highly recommend their Gnocchi, and the risotto I had made me cry a little.  But a good cry.  While I enjoyed my Venison Osso Bucco, it could have stood to have a bit more seasoning.  The CFO had a seafood risotto, with a huge pieces of calamari, gulf shrimp, and a perfectly cooked piece of tuna.    And what is a meal with out the beverages?  If you're in for a cocktail, Dish's Pimm's Cup and Mojito are spot on, and not unreasonably priced, at about $7 and $8 respectively.  Speaking of prices, Dish isn't exactly easy on the wallet, with somewhat conservative portion sizes, and entrees costing between $20 and $35, but it's not a backbreaker.  You can easily escape with a sub $100 bill for a dinner for two.    Dish is just a great little restaurant.  Clean, fun, and not too pretentious.  Which is almost as surprising as the food!"}
{"text":"A cute, dark, very intimate little (literally very small) spot, Dish has a small menu with some tasty options. Their dirty vodka martini is one of the best I've ever had, and at $10, they should get a prize.   However, the service was a bit spotty and the portions are quite small for the price. I'm all for quality over quantity, but when I'm still starving after my meal, I get sad. The quality was there. The grilled octopus was tender and clearly fresh. The mixed grill was expertly prepared. The veal rollatini was tasty, but surprisingly dry. Across the board, everything was a tad more bland than I prefer. Nothing made my mouth do the happy dance, and when menu prices are this high, I want my mouth do that dance throughout the meal. Everything was good, just not great.   Drinks, apps, and mains for our party of four came to $265 before tip.   I wouldn't recommend this place for a first date and would only come here in a large group if members of that group are comfy being shoulder-to-shoulder. In any case, make reservations."}
{"text":"Neighborhood is quite \"run-down\"...a neighborhood that lets you experience the worst Pittsburgh has to offer...Impossible to find parking on the week-end...Ordered a $27 meal and only received 2 shrimp, 2 scallops, a small piece of swordfish, and rice.  Huh?  Are they feeding grown men or children?  My guest ordered a $19 pasta dish that was just enough to feed a bird...and we're very skinny individuals...  On the positive side, great lighting.  In summary, 24k Gold pricing for .925 Silver.    I had high expectations and brought my appetite, but every aspect of the evening was disappointing...and now just thinking about it, my bum hurts...ouch...  I suppose the high prices and small portions are to ensure Dish can pay their rent...but in this area?  With teeming schools of boorish drunkards and parking that is LITERALLY NON-EXISTENT ?  \"DISH, PLEASE!\""}
{"text":"Excellent grilled calamari! We had homemade pastas--I had tagliatelle with Brussels sprouts and mushrooms!!! Yum yum yum! The prosecco was delightful!  I felt like I was back in Rome!"}
{"text":"This place is a real gem. We dined here once and the food was delicious. Especially the scallops. Very romantic and cozy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Unbelievable small Osteria on Pittsburghs \"South side\" .  Everything fresh and made in house. Sensational cocktails, homemade pasta, incredible ingredients.  Best carpaccio de bue I have had over a decade.  Great staff, a friendly owner and head chef who makes the rounds, and an intimate experience over all."}
{"text":"Do say we were disappointed is an understatement! The atmosphere was very loud, and not conducive to having a quiet conversation!      The menu was barely sparse and not tempting at all!!      I will NOT be returning OR recommending this restaurant to ANYONE!!"}
{"text":"Not as good as Toast for me, but not far off. Grilled calamari is like that I've had in Italy and Greece, perfectly cooked with garlic and olive oil. Pasta was a stand out, especially the mushroom and spinach fettucini which was almost as good as the similar dish my wife makes from Jamie Oliver's recipe (his also has sausage which is always a winner). The place is small but has tons of atmosphere. The copper bar is a classic and the service all round is excellent. Only issue is finding a parking spot on a Friday night - leave extra time."}
{"text":"It pains me to do this, and I may get flak for it. But I'm going three stars. Yelp is a weird place where a \"high end\" restaurant that doesn't produce ends up with three stars but a totally legit but still just pizza place can end up with five. I don't really get it, and maybe if we had half stars it would be better (Dish was definitely half way to four rather than straight up three). I guess it's what restauranteurs hate about Yelp and yet people who use Yelp begin to appreciate. At the end of the day, we're looking at averages over time. So here goes:  First off, I have really been looking forward to going here. After it being booked solid and risking a walk-in we decided to give it our best shot.   It's a cute little place, with a nice bar and two-tops in one room and more, larger tables in another. Even though we were walk-ins, they were able to find a two-top without too much trouble.   We had dirty martinis to start (good, not great) and began with the grilled octopus. This ended up being the best dish in my opinion. It lacked concept to me, the potatoes made no sense, but the protein was grilled perfectly and the arugula was a great accompaniment.   Our secondi was gnocchi with beef ragout, which was disappointingly under seasoned. First off the gnocchi, while perfect in texture were bland as heck. And then the beef sauce was as well. After heavily salting the sauce it was better but the gnocchi never recovered. Sad, because it could have been great!  Our main course was the seafood plate with saffron risotto. Some of the seafood components were good (the fish, scallops) while others were not (shrimp way overdone and calamari as well.) Worse yet, the risotto was decidedly underdone, a good two steps below al dente.   Sorry Dish, maybe it was a bad night, but it missed the mark by a wide margin based on the reputation. It'll be a while till it makes the rotation again, hopefully it can redeem itself!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool for how expensive it is.  It's really well decorated and has a pretty comfortable atmosphere.  It's small, but it makes the best use of it's space.  You'll enter the bar area first, which has a decent amount of space, but not a lot of seating.  The bartenders are pretty sharp, and there are some pretty cool beers on tap as well as a cool drink list.  The food is awesome, but there will always be a disconnect in my head when I pay a ton of money for something and I sit wringing my hands in anticipation, a gleam in my eye, fantasizing about the ginormous feast I'm about to have, only to be presented with a dish that will make you stare at your waitress with the sadness of an orphan on Christmas.  It is delicious, but you will want more."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews, we knew we had to get in for dinner.  We took the hotel shuttle and got dropped off right at the restaurant and had to grab 2 seats at the bar since they didn't have any tables open.  The bartender was Awesome!  I believe his name was Brian.  He made us some fabulous drinks, I'm a Hendricks Gin fan and he made some tasty drinks!  I decided to order the special homemade Gnocchi with the pork and beef sauce.  The flavors were AMAZING!  My taste buds were dancin up a storm!  That dish needs to be on the regular menu for sure!  My husband ordered the Rigatoni dish that was loaded with bacon, peas and creamy delicious white sauce- SO GOOD!   Brian then brought me a slice of their homemade lemon cheesecake with the most yummy crust ever!!  It was very nice and great to be treated so special for my birthday.  I can attest to all the great reviews this little gem has.  Highly recommend : )"}
{"text":"The restaurant is tucked away in what seems to be a residential community nonetheless it's a hidden gem worth finding.   Upon entering the main door you walk into the bar and the pathway leads to the host and the main dining area. I was promptly greeted by a gentleman who was very accommodating considering I did not have a reservation. I arrived at 6:20 pm and they had reservations for most tables except for one in the bar with views to the street.   He started by understating what my red wine preferences are and followed by offering two samples of reds he thought my satisfy my palette. The first he recommended was excellent and I subsequently ordered it.   They brought incredibly soft fresh bread. While I do my best not to over indulge in bread I could resist this soft heavenly bake.   I started with the Orange and Fennel salad which had a delicate balance of citrus and tang. It's very refreshing. Fair warning the olives are very salty which I personally enjoy but if you are sensitive to salt simply push those aside.   It's important to note they change their menu frequently. That said, what you see on Yelp is likely not current so call in advance if you want to know what is available. I offer this advice because I did not do it and was momentarily saddened by the fact that a fish dish I saw online was not on the menu. They did have another dish with fish and lots of shellfish, which I cannot eat. After discussing my dietary restrictions and expressing my preferences with the waitress I quickly learned the chef was happy to accommodate. Again I was met be excellent service making my experience all the more enjoyable.   My dish arrived piping hot, beautifully plated, cooked to perfection and just delicious. Seriously delicious. The saffron risotto is perfect. What more can I say? Just eat here!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for years. And I hate that I didn't go earlier since they will be closing in a week. It was bar seating only since they're booked till the last day but waiting wasn't bad and it went smoothly. Anyways, my brother and I shared the quail and the cavatelli. And oh my goodness the cavatelli. The meat was incredible. The sauce was perfect and the pasta wasn't over cooked at all. I'm even thinking about going back and waiting for another seat before they close!"}
{"text":"Splurging on dinner isn't something that Joshua and I do on a regular basis. But, for some reason this evening we decided to dress up and go out to a swanky place. So we dressed up and found Dish.  There was a little bit of a wait when we got there; but we hadn't called ahead, so we sat at the bar and had a beverage.   When we sat, we were greeted quickly by our server. She got us water and made educated menu suggestions. We then got bread and dip, and quickly inhaled that. So fresh.  Joshua ordered the Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare, and he was lucky I didn't steal his food. It was great. Perfect balance of seafood to pasta; and was cooked just right.   I had the Rigatoni alla Scamorza. Hands down the best Italian dish I've ever had. It sounded weird; but after our server suggested it; it was a done deal. Pistachios, prosciutto and parmigiana, it was just what I was looking for. And I haven't stopped craving it since. My birthday is next month, and I'm hoping this gives the hint that I'd like to go back!!   We also decided to go crazy and order dessert, too.  He got tiramisu, and I got bread pudding. He and I fought amongst ourselves to divide it. An amazing end to a perfect date.   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Very European. Slower service, close seating, dim lighting, and a cozy bar.   Highlight of the menu is the grilled calarmari appetizer. Tender, well charred, and perfectly seasoned. This was the first truly successful grilled calamari I have had (albiet, it was a couple years ago - I consistently order this same appetizer). Pastas are nicely done as well.   I've been here at least 5 times in the last 18 months and the menu has not changed. I am fine if that means there is a focus on execution and maintaining quality, but I realize some of you out there are looking for seasonal cuisine - this is not the spot for you. Their website does claim they are moving toward a more seasonally focused menu though.   BTW: Parking can be a pain. You can valet at Nakama and walk a block up if you're hard pressed. Otherwise, there is a public lot in South Side (across from Fat Heads) between 18th and 19th, or street parking only."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Can I  vote to award Dish about 5 extra stars! I started going here when I was around 18 and 12 years later, it still manages to blow my mind. If there was one word to describe this place, it is consistent. There are so many businesses in which you read reviews and the longer the exist, the more likely they start to go downhill on quality. That is not how Dish is. Everything is amazing from beginning to end  I went with my one girlfriend to celebrate a promotion she had gotten and we decided we would eat everything that we could possibly handle. For appetizers, we shared the carpaccio, Melanzane e Mozzarella di Bufala, and the shrimp appetizer. All three were perfect but my favorite was the carpaccio. If you have ever read my other reviews, it should be of no shock, but it was truly amazing.   For the our main courses, we both chose to go with pasta. I ordered a cavatelli with a lamb ragu and my friend ordered the mushroom pappardelle. I loved my dish so much that I could not stop eating it until it was almost gone (quite the accomplishment for someone who is shorter and scrawnier than most). We even decided to split a tiramisu and I managed to fit a few bites in before succumbing to a long, carb coma.   I feel like it is also important to note that the service is always amazing here. The atmosphere is intimate and everything is warm and inviting. It's not trendy or cool. It's just great, simple food that is made perfectly. I highly recommend going to Dish for any special event or for no reason at all!"}
{"text":"D I S H. What else can you say? One of the best authentic Italian places in Pittsburgh. Owner born and raised in Sicily, variety of cocktails and beers, short simplistic menu, but you still feel like you have so many choices to choose from because EVERYTHING sounds good, looks good, and is just GOOD.   Love coming here for date night due to romantic and quaint vibes at Dish. Usually avoid on the weekends, due to all of the bustle of the South Side bar scene, but absolutely one of my favorites can never go wrong, and haven't experienced a bad thing yet.   Dish is doing it right."}
{"text":"I'm clearly in the minority based on so many positive reviews, but I'm not going to let that influence my review and overlook a completely average experience.  My wife and I went to Dish for our anniversary. I hadn't been there in quite a few years (mainly because I wasn't that impressed then, either), but it was time to give it another shot with so many of our friends continuing to rave about the food/experience.  Dish's atmosphere has a romantic, cozy feel, so it's a decent place for a date, but it's so tightly packed that you might want to be prepared for some intimacy with the tables around you. We were tucked in the corner, though, so it wasn't bad.  Our server was nice, and her recommendation for our bottle of wine worked out well. She was attentive and did a good job of answering any questions that we had about the menu. No complaints there!  As far as the food, our meal started out well enough. We ordered the melanzane grigliate con mozzarella di bufala, which was excellent. The grilled eggplant was thinly sliced and perfectly cooked, and the balsamic/olive oil drizzle was delicious. We also ordered the beef carpaccio, which was perfectly serviceable. The appetizers had us optimistic heading into our main courses, but that optimism was quickly tempered.  We both opted for meat dishes, with my wife ordering the filet mignon, while I went with the pan roasted pork loin rolls stuffed with smoked mozzarella, speck and sage. My wife's steak was way undercooked, but considering we had just eaten carpaccio, that wasn't a huge deal for her. The bigger issue was the lack of flavor and the feeling that we could've made a better steak at home (that's the whole reason you go out, right? To have something that you CAN'T replicate or beat at home). Her side of mushroom risotto was a simple side that really didn't add anything to the plate in either presentation or taste. The other side of sautéed brussels sprouts - which we both had - was definitely the most memorable thing on her plate. Ouch.  For me, the pork loin rolls took a back seat to the side of gnocchi. Despite the excessive oiliness of the gnocchi, I thought the flavor and texture was excellent. The pork rolls seemed like a great idea, but the pork was too dry and overcooked. Oddly enough, while I'm not a huge brussels sprouts fan, they were really good.  In all, I wish I could say it was a $120 well spent, but I'd be a liar. We walked away highly disappointed and feeling like we made the wrong choice for our anniversary dinner. With Dish being 0-for-2 in my experiences, it's likely become a permanent afterthought for me.   If you're a Southsider, I can see the appeal, as it's a nice respite from the typical Southside scene. The intimate atmosphere is also promising, but if your meal was anything like ours, the food surely won't match the potential that the atmosphere creates upon entering Dish. I sincerely hope your experience(s) are better, as clearly most reviewers have nothing but positives to say. Good luck!"}
{"text":"The Melanzane Grigliate e Mozzarella di Bufala was amazing as was the Polpo alla Griglia. Ask for Joshua-his service and recommendations are on point."}
{"text":"The owner really cares about this place--you can tell the moment he greets you when you enter this cute tucked away bistro.  He's from Sicily and seems heavily involved with all aspects of the food and menu. I was pleased to find ingredients you almost never find in Pittsburgh \"Italian\" restaurants--oxtail, sardines, baby octopus.  No mushy overcooked pasta-- finally a restaurant that will serve pasta how it should be: al dente!!"}
{"text":"Pricey but great atmosphere and food... I couldn't afford to go there often myself, but my brother paid so, I didn't have to worry about the price :) Some might find it a little hard to read the menu, if their eyesight is not that great-as the lighting is very low and indirect, but well-placed to create an intimate, visually-appealing setting. Getting reservations is recommended as the place is small and busy."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and hospitality was great. The food was over the top. I had the tuna cooked to perfection the way that I liked it. We will come back again."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place. Overall food was  good. We ordered a pork chop which was good, but our side of pasta showed us we should have opted for a pasta entre instead. Attentive service, but our waiter didn't know much at all about wine so I politely asked for the heavily Italian-accented owner who I was sure had a handle on the all Italiano wine list. Well, our less than knowledgeable waiter wouldn't relinquish his  position and recommended what was about the worst bottle I have had in a long, long time. Even so, it was a good experience, would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a little TOO formal for me.  The dishes are small (by American standards) but was plenty to fill me up.  Nice bread and olive oil to start. Very formal service.  Seating is cozy.  Our table neighbor felt like commenting on everything we were talking about which was a bit odd.  I hade the mushroom dish and it was a bit bland.  The stuffed pork chop was amazing though.  Mushroom risotto got a thumbs down.  Lamb capellini was also good, needed more seasoning.  Overall, good.  Could use a couple more \"normal\" vodka and tequila cocktails IMO.  Some people just don't like wine or gin, etc."}
{"text":"Good but not great is probably the best way to describe this upscale south side Italian joint. Tucked into a converted row house, the restaurant feels crowded and the noise level is off the charts; the hardwood floors don't help the situation.  My date sat two feet from my face yet we could hardly hear each other over the music, noise and constant scraping/banging of chairs against the pesky hardwood floors. Still, the food was good, inventive and thoughtfully prepared but combine the noise level, smoke [people still smoke in Pennsylvania restaurants] and the near impossibility of parking on the south side on a Saturday night and I'd have to rethink a return."}
{"text":"Dish is one of the consistently best restaurants in the city. I've never had a bad meal there, and I've had many. There's no red sauce on this Sicilian-inspired menu that features grilled calamari (awesome), perfectly cooked pastas with amazing sauces and ragouts which change frequently (gnocchi with any ragout is awesome), and fish that feature a lot of cooking on the grill and with olive oil and garlic. The ambiance is quaint as the restaurant is small -- and has a sexy feel to it with the dark wood floors and furnishings and candles throughout. It can be crowded and a little noisy, but the customers are typically a friendly communal bunch. Service is friendly and casual, yet professional. The staff knows their food and drinks well. The wine list is somewhat small and mostly Italian, but the staff can make great recommendations. Perhaps one of the restaurants best assets is that the kitchen is open till midnight (Monday-Saturday). The bar is an enjoying place to socialize before or after dinner -- or for a more casual place to eat. Raelynn and Alyssa, the bartenders, are very friendly and concoct some great drinks.  Parking on South Side can be a challenge, especially on weekends, but it's worth the hassle, and is also a reason to visit on weekdays when South Side is less busy."}
{"text":"Dish offers the best Italian food in Pittsburgh. Period. I HIGHLY recommend making a reservation because the restaurant is pretty small. It CAN get loud during peak hours, but the food and service more than make up for that. Plus, it's a sign that people are enjoying themselves over great food and wine. Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"Loved the intimate atmosphere. Came here on a date and it was really perfect. Parking was a bit of a trip, though. Had to drive around for a good 20 minutes to find! But then again, it was a Friday night in the South Side.   The food and service were all impeccable. Highly recommend the duck cavatelli. The meat was so tender and the flavor resonated throughout the dish. You can tell the pasta is homemade and to me, that makes all the difference in the world.  Nice wine list with a variety of prices on Italian wines. Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Okay I'm pretty disappointed. I'm been a server for years so I know how it is. But this is the second time that I've come here, and it's so frustrating when spending $60 (pre-tip) isn't \"enough\" for the server to pay attention to us. This second visit we had a different server than our first visit, but the experience was unfortunately the same.   Like, we shouldn't have to wait for the bill for 20 minutes when there are only a couple other tables there. My boyfriend said he's never coming back here again and doesn't even want to eat at any restaurants at all anymore due to this experience. Which sucks since the food here is amazing, but the servers should treat the $60 customers just as well as they treat the $250 customers. As I said, I've been a server, and it's just rude and annoying to treat smaller bill tables worse. They're still people who will tip well for having a good experience, even if the bill isn't huge.   Tl;dr the food here is awesome, the service is good if you spend a whole ton, if you don't then don't expect much service."}
{"text":"BEST RESTAURANT IN PITTSBURGH. I seriously am obsessed with this place. The food is amazing, wine list is on point, and service is great. Getting a reservation can be tricky but it is so worth it."}
{"text":"Dish absolutely lived up to the hype. I've heard so many great things and was excited to visit. I was concerned because I hadn't made reservations, however I was told there would be two tables set aside for walk-ins.   The ambiance: Intimate, great blend of ambient noise and quiet, seating for roughly 35 people.   The food: authentic Italian, al dente pasta preparation, great taste. I had the Spaghetti Frutti di Mare and the shrimp were jumbo size and portion quite generous.   The drinks: I had a caprihlana and it was perfect. Cocktail menu has good variety. Plenty of choices for wine as well.   The service: Excellent. Always available and attentive yet never interrupted conversation, made quality suggestions and handled substations and requests with ease.   This is a must-visit for Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The intimacy of this place is one of its strengths as well as one of its weaknesses. At times it can be difficult to get a table. I made reservations for 8:30 p.m. on a Wednesday night after a play at City Theatre, and they walked us passed two empty tables in the bar area, offering us a cramped table in the corner. However, they happily moved us back to the bar immediately upon our request. The space is beautiful and the food is great. The pear & walnut salad special was perfect. I also had the Linguine ai Frutti di Mare, which was very good (they even allowed me to exclude muscles from my serving), but my dinning companion had the Tagliolini alla Puttanesca di Mare, which was really wonderful."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time!  Everything was perfect from the appetizers to dessert.  Will definitely have to visit this restaurant again.  Well worth the cost.  Only downside is the parking in south side.  Street parking only."}
{"text":"I love the fish and seafood selections at Dish. The food is always delicious and fresh and the wait staff and owner (often present) are very friendly. The small sophisticated menue always has new things to try and options for any type of taste. The prices are reasonable for this caliber of resturant. The drink menu is expansive and the Mojitos are probably one of my favorite if not having one of the rotating local brews on tap. Reservations should be made if dining but it is really a nice place to grab drinks too. The ambiance makes you feel like you have left Pittsburgh and stepped into... well anywhere not Pittsburgh. It is deffinately one of my favorite places to dine when I am visiting Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Southside isn't normally the neighborhood you think to go for date night, but Dish is the perfect spot with its intimate seating, romantic lighting, and extensive wine list.   We split the charcuterie board to start and I ordered the linguine di mare. My dish was good, but because the sauce wasn't flavorful enough, even the seafood lover in me wouldn't jump to order it again. I tried my date's gnocchi - much better flavor. On my next visit, I may even consider just splitting a few appetizers.   Based on the ambiance and excellent service, I would definitely return for a date or 2-4 person dinner out"}
{"text":"On the recommendation of a local restaurant/bar owner my sis and I visited Dish one Thursday night. From the moment we sat at the bar we felt welcome and comfortable.  The owner milled around in all his spicy Italian-ness, greeting people, talking to vendors and chatting with the staff. The wine list was really good and the cocktails were delish.  Let me get to the food though, the real star behind this production. We enjoyed an eggplant appetizer that was finger-licking good and my \"Linguine ai Frutti di Mare\" nearly brought me to tears with a broth so savory yet delicate that I had to take a moment to myself.   The restaurant filled up fast, since it's pretty tiny but if you get there early it's no problem. I would visit this place again and again, just to have this dish. Made me want to sing an aria..lucky for my fellow diners I resisted."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent.  The atmosphere is on the romantic side. What not to like? The prices are good too.  Eat here for the same amount as an oyster bar and fancy pizza place last week.  The bar has a happy hour with $1 off some small apps (Bocas menu and beer on tap) that are available at the bar.  The Mozzarella with egg plant copanata was a great start.  For the main course ordered the Pheasant with rosemary, grilled homemade gnocchi and brussels sprouts that was perfectly cooked and outstanding.   We split the Lemoncello Ricotta cheese cake, excellent. Not sure why it has been so many years since my last visit, but this place rocks.  One of the better restaurants in the Burgh.   The wine list has a couple of inexpensive wines that are pretty good.   Also good cocktails and beer list."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in Dish. My wife and I along with two friends had reservations for a Friday night. We got there a few minutes before our reservation, but still had to wait for over a half hour for a table without so much as a thank you or an apology. By the time we ordered, which was another 20 minutes or so, we were all starving. The waiter told us what the specials were, and I ordered one of them to which he replied \"I'm sorry, but were all out of that\". WTF?! Then why did you just recommend it? I then ordered something else. Also out. Third choice was a charm. A pork shank served on risotto I think. What I got was an over cooked hunk of pig fat, a giant pig bone, and some soupy rice. All of our food was pretty terrible. I don't know why Pittsburghers recommend this place. Any time I come by here, since it was about a block from my house, 3 to 6 staffers are just sitting outside puffing away on cigarettes.   Disgusting. Overpriced. Crowded. Tiny. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Restaurant in Pittsburgh......hands down!! Servers are always knowledgeable, ambiance is incredible, food is always spot on!! This restaurant takes pride in preparing dishes with such flavor and creativity......there's just none like it!! The bar area is fantastic and the music is very cool!! I would highly recommend for ANY occasion!"}
{"text":"Another great evening and meal at Dish.  Everything from the service, the atmosphere, and the food and drink was top notch as always.  Two things always amaze me at Dish:  1) the consistent high quality of the food and service every time. It's not two or three great meals followed by a clunker, it's always very, very good.  2) the house salad. Blows me away every time. How is that possible? It's a house salad, for Pete's sake, but the freshness and crispness of the greens along with just the right amount of dressing makes it splendid.  Their grilled calamari and octopi are pretty remarkable also."}
{"text":"Came back here for the first time in a long time for a birthday dinner. I had remembered it being great my first visit, and was worried my second visit wouldn't live up to my memory, but if anything, it was even greater!  We got the beef carpaccio and the grilled octopus to start. Both were quite good. The carpaccio was beautiful and the cheese was a delicious complement. The octopus was cooked well, definitely could taste the grilled part, and everything was great with it.  We split the pappardelle ai funghi. Perfectly al dente and savory. The server had them split it for us beforehand which was nice. :)  I was stuffed, but had to end on the chocolate bread pudding (I can't say no to chocolate or bread pudding!). It was not so bread pudding-y, but it was very chocolatey and satisfying. The berry coulis was that nice bit of tart to pair with the richness of this dish.   Solid food, cool ambiance, and just an all-around great place. I have to remember to come back here more often!"}
{"text":"Managed by two sicilians, the place is unusual for Pittsburgh.  It has a feel of being on West Broadway in SoHo.  Even the sign outside is un-Pittsburgh:  custom-made metalworks.  Obviously the two co-owners have put a signature on it.  Lets talk food:  the southern italy influence is evident from reading the menu.  But instead of the usual mass-produced menus for your average run-of-the-mill trattoria, the menu carefully offers what I would suggest to be a \"regional sicilian\" repertoire of culinary offerings.  Sure, it is pricey, but try that yourself in finding quality foods and preparing them the way they do.  As for the ambience:  the place is small, with tables favoring more the one-on-one meetups.  Nice for a date.  Away from the busy Carson Street three blocks away, with its roaming teen-agers, the place really targets those that WANT to come here to spend a pleasant 60 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We started with the caprese salad and I think it was my favorite dish. The tomatoes were extremely fresh as was the cheese. The balsamic was perfect and light. I had the rigatoni with creamy pesto which was so so good and my boyfriend had a bunch of seafood piled high. We took some leftovers and it was just as good the next day. I would recommend to anyone in town!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Dish and when my coworker confirmed them, I wanted to visit.  We visited on a Saturday night.  Without a reservation, we were stuck having to dine in the bar area.  No worries, I actually like the bar area here.  Our server was incredible.  Very friendly, very helpful with suggestions.  We started with a Insalata di Arance e Finocchi.  Yeah, I can't say that either.  But it's a salad with fennel and oranges and arugola, red onions with a light red wine dressing.  Perfection.  Incredibly fresh and tasty.  For our meals, the bf had one of his favorite Italian dishes - Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare and it did not disappoint.  The scallops, mussels, shrimp, little neck clams and calamari were fresh and delicious.  They were also able to spice up the red pepper sauce which made him very happy.  I got the Rigatoni alla Scamorza, good bless you.  It rigatoni with smokey mozzarella, peas and pistachio nuts in a cream sauce.  I absolutely loved this dish!  Since our meals were so delicious, we could not say no to dessert.  We shared the mango cake and it was perfection.  We really love our experience here."}
{"text":"my boyfriend surprised me for my birthday with dinner at dish. he had called a day or two before to make reservations and was told he should have called basically a month before. but if he came in right at 5, he'd probably get a table for two. that's exactly what we did and we got one of 3 open tables, so DO make a reservation way ahead of time, or DO be waiting at the door when they open. we both got wine with our meal and a olive marinate appetizer. the olives were pretty good, a lot of variety. i got the gnocchi with lamb and it was amazing. the gnocchies themselves  were stuffed with ricotta, so innovative and delish. he got a pasta with hen of the woods mushrooms in an oil sauce. also delicious, but i have to recommend the gnocchi to anyone who ever goes there. the service was excellent and the place is intimate and cute. not super fancy, but definitely a nice place to go for a special occasion. worth the early reservation or waiting at the door for sure."}
{"text":"I love Dish! Parking is hard but it's got a nice ambience - dim but also not loud so you can have a pleasant conversation. The portions are a perfect size! I've loved everything that I've eaten here - especially the mushroom pasta - except the olives which have a citrus zest - didn't go well with my palette. Great for a nice evening out or for a special occasion. You won't regret coming to this spot!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food has always delivered. I'm a big fan of getting a few the veal appetizer, all of their seafood apps and mains AND the Brussels Sprouts are the best I've ever had. This is a perfect spot for an initmate dinner. I love coming here earlier in the evenings with my husband for drinks and light fare at the bar b/f it gets too crowded. I would not recommend Dish for larger groups as the dinning room can get quite noisy making it hard to hear everyone at the table. And I've always had excellent service at every visit."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Italian (too heavy), but this place is definitely worth a visit. Loved the ambiance of this cozy, dim space. Music may have been a bit too loud and out of place, but the service was excellent. Many reviews highlighted the antipasto and the baked ricotta in particular, but it was nothing to write home about. I could have easily assembled a similar melange of pickled veggies, olives and cheeses at home.   I did however enjoy the pork chop dish and pasta with creamy pistachio and peas sauce. The pasta was cooked just right and the sauce was so delicious. Save room for dessert because the chocolate bread pudding is heaven."}
{"text":"Rich, creamy, and delicious pasta.  I can't tell if they make their own pasta, but it's well made and al dente, and the ambiance is great.  Unfortunately I was way too stuffed for dessert/appetizer, but that saves reason to come back next time!"}
{"text":"Really good food, and open late for a upscale Pittsburgh joint. I've been here on a Thursday night and the kitchen was open 'til 12:30am.  It's also pricier for Pittsburgh, but you get what you pay for.  Entrees average $19; small plates are ~$9.  The menu is small but highlights what they're good at, and there's always a special menu. The entrees we've had so far have been very good with a few excellent.   Service has been spotty, or I'd have given Dish 5 stars; twice now I've had to wait over 10 minutes for a refill of water, even with a half-full restaurant.  Beer is relatively affordable as well; Rolling Rock for example was ~$3, and they've got a solid wine list.  Try it out at least once, it's worth it."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday and were pleasantly surprised that this nondescript building tucked away down a side street housed such amazing Italian cuisine.  The mushroom bruschetta (Bruschetta ai Funghi) was fabulous, as was the Fettuccine ai Funghi e Spinaci.  I would have given it 5 stars but it's not as vegetarian friendly as I would have liked.  The fettuccine was the only vegetarian entree option, and the server indicated that modifications to dishes/sauces would not be made to make any of the other entrees veggie friendly.  I was disappointed that a restaurant of that caliber that clearly employs a chef of considerable talent would be unwilling to accommodate special diets.  We filled up on the delicious antipasto, salads, and breads, and left satisfied, but it does put a sour taste in your mouth when a waiter tells you that \"it's too bad you're a vegetarian\" and is unwilling to remove meat from a dish when you're willing to drop close to $100 for a special occasion meal."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to coming back here for a while. I remember it being delicious, but that's about it. If my memory served me right, I'd be in Italian food heaven!  The ambiance is uber romantical. It's very dimly lit. Almost so much that I really wanted to use my cell phone light to see the menu. I didn't want to seem 80 years old, so I sucked it up and squinted. I almost felt bad having a ladies night out instead of being with my lover, er husband, for this romantic affair. Better to be a ladies night and stuff your face though:)  We ordered up a bottle of Malbec to split for around $40. Wasn't my fave Malbec I will note, but I had no problem taking it down! We ordered the Melanzane grigliate con Mozzarella di Bufala (which I had to copy and paste from the website or there would be no way I could spell that correctly!). It was grilled eggplant, buffalo mozzarella and basil drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The eggplant was thinly sliced and cooked perfectly. I think it's really easy to mess it up, but they perfected it, between the eggplant and creamy mozz.  For dinner I had the Tagliatelle ai Funghi which was tagliatelle (a thicker noodle pasta) with Portobello, shiitake and cremini mushrooms in extra virgin and garlic. Spinach, basil and parmiggiano Reggiano. For $15 it was a good size portion. I enjoy al dente pasta, but it was maybe just a smidge too al dente for me. I thought the dish was good, don't get me wrong. It had flavor, but it wasn't bursting with flavor. It was solid, but I guess I was expecting it to blow me away.   The Chocolate Bread Pudding was delicious. It came out all ooey and gooey and just scrumptious. The added cherry syrup was just the \"icing\" on the cake aka pudding. A great end to a great meal!  That's why I think I'll go back, get a different dish and still have a good experience. Maybe I'm too optimistic, but I still think this is a fantastic restaurant and maybe I had a miss on the main dish. Believe me, I don't mind taste testing pasta!"}
{"text":"Wanted to post an update. Heard from the promptly heard from the owner who promised to address the service issue and was very nice.    Let me update the review regarding the food. My al la Mare pasta was excellent. The scallops, specifically, were so tender and flavorful that i can close my eyes and still call up there aromatic flavor.   The pasta had a great bite and the flavor added to the dish. My husband and I both loved the house salad. Not overly complicated, but the ingredients were excellent and fresh and the homemade vinaigrette was excellent.   The house bread basket and dipping oil was appealing.   Would have lived some fresh-brewed ice tea.   A wonderful place to have dinner."}
{"text":"I finally made it here after living in the Southside for a year! I'm not sure why it took me so long, because this would be a great place to enjoy a nice drink and appetizer at the bar after work while avoiding the typical Southside crowd. I ordered gnocchi, which comes served in a wild boar ragu, and it was to-die-for (sorry - I really don't know how else to explain it!). I savored every last bite despite the fact that I was full after eating half of the dish, but I didn't want to waste a single taste. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I really have no new information to report, because much of what I've said in February remains the same today, except it's better now because the restaurant is non-smoking.  The main reason for this update is to try and refute some of the hateration from Lauren B. from Phily on Liz.  I don't recall reading a review that was so malicious towards one individual in a restaurant.  I've had Liz as a bartender for a long time now and used to go to Dish a couple times a month.  Michele and Andres are great (owners and chef) and the rest of the staff is superb, especially Liz.  I don't really understand the venom of Lauren B..  I mean she never really gives much in the way of specifics of why she hates Liz.  I've seen Liz wait on hundreds of folks through the years of all different types and she has always treated them with respect if not outright wit and charm.  It's not just the regulars like me.  Sure, the place gets busy and often it can take a few minutes to get a drink.  But, what worthwhile place doesn't occassionally get busy.  Anyways, just needed to voice a different viewpoint.  Lauren, I  can't imagine that Liz did something to justify such a mean spirited review.  In fact, I'm pretty sure this review is much more  a reflection of you than her or the restaurant.  Good luck with that."}
{"text":"I went back to one of my favorites this week and was reminded again why I love Dish so much....  It's AMAZING!!!!  The most charming atmosphere makes it so easy to enjoy an intimate conversation accompanied by of course... AMAZING DRINKS + FOOD!  This time we just went light and ordered a few martinis, but couldn't resist the grilled calamari, which was excellent.  I first ordered le dolce vita (chocolate cream martini) for the first time and was very impressed; usually I am a standard dirty vodka girl.    I haven't reviewed in awhile but wanted to give this gem a well deserved shout out!!"}
{"text":"We found the atmosphere here romantic - nice ambience.  Lowly lit, mostly by candlelight at our table.  The food was very good.  For entrees we got spaghetti ai frutti di mare, grigliata di pesce.  We also got house salads and a seafood salad as well, and some tiramisu for dessert.  Everything was well prepared, and the ingredients were very fresh - this particularly stood out in the salads.  The restaurant is split up into two sections - one side with a bar and a few tables, and the other side with tables only.  My only criticism was that it was a bit loud inside, especially on the bar side.  Luckily we were sat in the most quiet section, and were sitting side by side so we could still easily hear one another."}
{"text":"We very much enjoyed this impromptu stop at one of the places I have been longing to try!   Our waiter was prompt and polite, and made sure that we knew about the changes in the menu.   After perusing a list of very appealing selections, we decided on splitting the Grigliata (tuna) on a bed of saffron risotto with a vegetable and seafood mix that complimented the sides of the tuna.   Everything was cooked to perfection, and this is not an over exaggeration. Our only complaint is that the vegetable mix was brined in a lot of salt. A LOT of salt. There were olives in this mixture, so I would urge the preparers to back off a bit on the NaCl.   Service was timely throughout the meal, and quite pleasant.   Wine selection was impressive and beer selection was great for what we expected to be a wine bar.   Music was too loud, and lighting was too dark. Time: 8:30 ish.   Other than that, I loved this place. Perfect for a date night. Atmosphere: +"}
{"text":"A very nice seafood dinner for my family. My wife loved the Frutti di Mare linguini, my six year old loved my leek soup and tilefish, especially the garlicky spinach and potato salad, and I enjoyed what she left me. Nice wine selection, and excellent bread. Definitely a repeater."}
{"text":"Buckle up, buttercups. This is going to be a weird one. I'm in that sort of mood.   When I lived in the South Side, I used to walk by this restaurant almost every day and sniff, \"Hmph. Hipster bar. Who names their place 'Dish'?\"  It reminded me of an episode of Family Guy where Brian, Stewie and Frank Sinatra, Jr. opened a pretentious nightclub called \"Place\". In retrospect, I was being kind of jerk about Dish.  Thankfully, Dish offers fantastic food and service. When we arrived, we were about ten minutes early for our Friday night reservation, so we ordered beers at the bar. Oh, I should mention that one of the only reasons (besides a positive word of mouth) that Boy wanted to try this place was because they carry a wine whose label name is also Boy's surname. Holy potatoes! Of course we ordered a bottle of that red wine, which was very dry, and had a pleasant, mellow tannin. It's a good wine so if you want to know what it is send a self-abused stamped antelope (or DM) to me.   I chose the mushroom soup (with crimini, portabello and black truffle oil) to start. I have to say... AMAZING. Hands down the best mushroom soup I've ever had. Boy? Hates mushrooms. One of the many people in my life who hates them, in fact. What is with you people? Penicillin is from a fungus too, you know.  I bet that won't stop you from taking it when you need it to save your life. Haters.   For the main course, I had the stuffed veal and my date chose the steak. The veal was outstanding, tender, and I ate every last bite. My entree was accompanied by pillows of ricotta gnocchi and julienned brussels sprouts. Very tasty and surprisingly light for gnocchi. The brussels sprouts would convert any veggie hater into lover in two seconds flat. Boy (and I) were less than enthused about the steak. It was simply \"ok.\"   Dish's servers are friendly and knowledgable. I feel bad that I ever made fun of this cozy establishment with great food.   Downsides: as with any small place, it fills up quickly, and can be loud."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to get to Dish for some time, I heard only good things from my friends.  After we left I was kicking myself for taking so long to finally get there.  Dish is a great restaurant with a full fantastic menu and amazing ambiance.  The food was perfectly cooked and the waitstaff had excellent advice. I can't wait to go back for more."}
