{"text":"Wow. Just loved this place.  Food was hot and great. Our server was sweet and recommended things she had tried and her advise was spot on. 
I had the chicken franceses and I got ravioli!!!! As a side woo hoo!!!"}
{"text":"Dino's is the kind of Italian restaurant we all hope moves into our neighborhood. They serve one of the better veal piccatas I've had in this city along with every other dish I've tried.The chef is the son of the original owner of the old Dino's which was on Cave Creek road for 40 years plus. I cook these dishes and have eaten Italian food all over Italy. Try Dino's. You will not be disappointed and are in for a huge treat! 
I want to add that Dino's fresh made bread is the best I've eaten in this city. The bakery also has some good choices.
Update: The sauces as of late are completely bland without any seasoning whatsoever. There is no excuse for this when you are serving the food of Southern Italy."}
{"text":"Everything we had was great! Heard about this place from some friends and we tried it out. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Family Owned, REAL Italian American comfort food. I've had most of the items on the menu and they are all amazing! I've done both eat-in and pick-up, always great quality with both.  Super affordable, so I can go there more often and get my fix on the flavours of my childhood. Great customer service, friendly staff/management."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat while traveling through Phoenix and was happily surprised! Ordered a Caesar salad for the table that was really good and then a large \"how you doin'?\" pizza with homemade sausage on it that was delicious! Everything came out fairly quickly, but very fresh. The waitstaff was very attentive and nice as well. I don't live in the area so I can't say when I'll be back, but I'll definitely stop by next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ate here last week, food was delicious! I'm an Italian from Chicago and having authentic yummy food with an amazing bakery is a nice change! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today. Had the best tasting Italian Beef sandwich and my son had the chicken parm and our friend Matt had the Italian Sausage and peppers. All were very tasty. In fact my son said the Chicken parm was like an orgasm in his mouth. Not sure that is a good explanation but it was really good. And as a former Bar/restaurant owner they did good. 

I also picked up some pastries to take home. Unless they are not good consider this a very successful stop on our food stops. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Family went to Dino's for dinner and the food was excellent . Husband had stuffed shells, Mom had a sausage and peppers sandwich and we also ordered pizza.  The food was served promptly, and each dish was great. The shells were jam packed with cheese and flavor. Their sauce is wonderful. The sausage and peppers were very good also. The sausage is not in the skin so it is served with the peppers and the texture is wonderful the way the flavors mix. We love pizza and theirs was great. Just plain cheese and it was wonderful.  Recommend this placed highly."}
{"text":"Second time and a major improvement in our total dining experience.  Not only was the wait staff now knowledgeable, but they were genuinely warm and friendly.  But we are after all here to eat.  The salad which was pathetic on our first visit, was larger, lettuce crisp and dry, color provided by tomato, cucumber and pepprocini.  My soup was a tad salty but had great flavor and full of veggies and pasta. 
I almost always have linguini and clam sauce, but tonight ordered veal parm.  Excellent!  They accommodated my wife by mixing and matching her specific requests to bring her a new version of chicken Angelo.  
All in all we had a great meal and will definitely be back sooner than later"}
{"text":"Had Dino's cater a party and I've never been so happy with their employees, organization and timeliness. They gave 100% so I give them 100%!!!!"}
{"text":"As promised during my last review of Dino's, I returned to see how things had improved over time.  They took over the former Belfiore's and my last visit garnered a 4 star review.  It would have been 5 stars had their fettucini alfredo been on point.  
Despite being Saturday night, Dino's did not have a full house-- I would say it was mostly empty except for maybe 5  tables including myself.  They also had a little gathering going on in a separate room.  I noted that they did a lot of decorative work on the place.  A paint job, more pictures on the wall and the words \"Ristoranti\" in bold red letters in the dining room.  The former owners had been criticized for their blah decor, so this was clearly a step in the right direction.  Could use a lot more pictures in the new party room.  I know you are just interested in my opinion of the food but I am giving them credit where credit is due and I am also avoiding the discussion about food.  
Ordering:  I saw chicken and veal parmagiana on the menu as well as shrimp scampi.  So I thought to myself, why not ask them to make me shrimp parmagiana- I haven't had that in a while.  So I told the waitress (who was fairly new to the job) what I wanted and she wrote it down and she said there might be an up charge.  I said OK, just find out what the up charge is before I finalize the order.  The young lady returned to tell me that the chef cannot make shrimp parmagiana.  I asked why.  She said that the shrimp have been already apportioned (?) and therefore he cannot make it.  I said, \"HUH?\".  I tried to explain how it could be made.  I said: \"You sautee shrimp, put marinara sauce on it, add mozzarella and melt it in the broiler. You know,  like you would do with a chicken cutlet if you were making chicken parmagiana.\"  To which the waitress answered:  \"What's a chicken cutlet?\"  She said, \"I never heard of that before\".  I KID YOU NOT.  Then I knew the conversation was over. No other words needed to be uttered.   I ordered chicken parmagiana instead.  I also ordered a salad with blue cheese dressing on the side.  The salad has improved since the last time. It Included red onions, 1 pepperocini pepper, and the outside of a piece of tomato, and sliced black olives.  Better than before, but the tomato was kind of weird, it had all the seeds and insides removed.  When the salad arrived, it came with a side of some other type of dressing- reddish in color but definitely not blue cheese dressing. (PHOTO)  Asked another waitress for blue cheese dressing and got it.  
They served us fresh, hot bread.  Not super delicious but not bad at all.  I enjoyed it with butter.  Hubby asked for olive oil to dip the bread, but the quality of the oil was so bad that it wasn't worth dunking--You know, that super light olive oil that tastes like nothing.  
My chicken parmagiana looked quite attractive when it arrived. (PHOTO).  I found the dish overdressed with spaghetti sauce--drowning in fact.  The chef has to cut back on the amount of sauce.  I also noted that the sauce had an overwhelming amount of oregano.  Oregano is the kind of spice that should make a dish taste better not take over the dish.  No one wants to eat oregano. The chicken was overcooked and so was the capellini pasta.  It's easy to over- cook capellini-- 8 minutes is all it needs.  Couldn't finish the dish.  Hubby's penne was not overcooked but his chicken was.  His dish too was saturated with sauce.  He asked for a chicken-eggplant combo and got an up charge of $5 on the bill.  Shouldn't the waitress have explained that beforehand?  I had asked what the up charge would have been on my theoretical shrimp parmagiana--why wouldn't we want to know about the up charge on hubby's dish? 
Service:   Our young waitress was clearly inexperienced but she did her best.  Wrong dressing is an innocent mistake but she needs to learn what a chicken cutlet is.  Ideally, the training for a waitress should include the ingredients and preparation of a dish.  I realize this is not an expensive restaurant, but training should be done never-the-less.  
I wish I could be more positive about our experience last night.  I will say that the pizza on the next table looked really delicious.  Hope it was."}
{"text":"Okay, 
So I was a little upset that they bought out Belfiore, but hey, things change. I took my boyfriend there for a sweet treat, and was surprised by the small variety. ..but they make it up in quality!  I had the lobster tail (puff pastry filled with custard) and he had the canoli horn filled with custard, topped with almond.  Both were AMAZING!  it was about 8.00 for both, and totally worth it. Hands down, it was the best lobster tail pastry I've ever had"}
{"text":"You know, I wish I could do 4.5 stars but what the heck, I've always had good food & good service. Tonight I picked up an eggplant parmesan sub. So good! Thin slices of breaded, fried, eggplant with sauce & cheese on a house made roll. If there is one thing Dino's knows how to do is make their ingredients sing! You could taste the eggplant, the sauce and cheese all well balanced. The eggplant was not greasy or tasteless. Loved it. Dino's is fast becoming my go-to place for good Italian-American food."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. I'm an upstate NY native myself and felt right at home in this Buffalo-transplant owned restaurant. They are a bakery, deli, and restaurant all packed into one offering authentic Italian meals. I ordered takeout and the food was awesome, service was super fast and friendly, and the prices are very reasonable. Definitely a must try if you're looking for real Italian food!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome service. We came for mom's birthday on Wine Wednesday. The lasagna and manicotti were perfect. The homemade chicken noodle and minestrone soups tasted amazing. Do not forget dessert from the bakery."}
{"text":"The one star is for the fact that DINO's has closed. This was such a GREAT restaurant back when they were farther south on Cave Creek Road back in the day. (70's-80's) I was so looking forward to eating there again. I'm really bummed. Hope they open up again soon. DINO's we need you!!!"}
{"text":"My second time, and might be my last.  First time they were only open a couple weeks.  I was the only person in the place and wasn't greeted when I came in. I ordered a slice to dine in.  The employee couldn't have looked less interested in waiting on me.  I almost didn't ask about the baked goods but I wanted a cookie.  She didn't know anything that was in the cases.  I sat down and when she brought my pizza she basically threw it on the table without a word. The pizza was slightly above average as was the tiramisu cookie... So I tried again today.  Very friendly server, but a bit overwhelmed.  I needed 4 cookies and a slice to go.  20 minutes later, its ready, but 2 of the cookies are wrong.  Okay, maybe I miscommunicated so I wanted to buy the other 2 cookies for my friends and the server who is overwhelmed (1 table was leaving with 2 ladies and a single person came in for a slice) told me that the owner would take care of me. I stood at the bakery case for another 5 minutes.  The owner was discussing advertising with 2 gentlemen, so I don't know if he knew I was waiting, but 25 minutes is a little excessive for a quick to go order, so I left.  There are a lot of pizza places that are comparable or better and I can sacrifice having a cookie.  Customer service is important to me and the main reason I am a repeat customer.  Talked to people in the nail salon in the same complex and they said my experience is similar to others they have heard.  Can't say I'd recommend this place to friends and family based on my two visits."}
{"text":"Tried this new place because I was craving pasta and sausage. Checked out their menu on their website. Great prices. We were greeted by Trish. She is a gem. $8.95 for pasta, sausage, salad and bread. Great meal for the price. Trish showed us some yummy looking desserts but we were too full. I was kicking myself an hour later that I didn't bring one home. I'll definitely go back. Happy to have a solid place within walking distance."}
{"text":"Sometimes we drive right by strip mall restaurants for fear of their quality.  Dino's is tucked into the strip mall, but the food is amazingly delightful.  The bread is made onsite and fluffy on the inside. It is served with butter, but if they could offer oil and balsamic it would enhance the presentation. It's already a flavorful round pre-cut.  The salad dressing is homemade and not overbearing at all with the garlic and spices.  I had the chicken piccata with artichoke and mushrooms over angel hair pasta. It was a fine portion entree.  The chicken was sliced mixed in and so the dish was easy to eat. Flavor was well balanced.  Not much lemony which was fine, because I contemplated Marsala style. Tasty either way.  I skipped dessert but the offerings in the bakery area made it tempting. No dessert menu, so you need to walk over to the cases to pick out something nice. I would recommend this for casual nights out and enjoy a wonderful meal with low key ambiance."}
{"text":"I had left an initial review but since some time has gone by and since there have been changes to the business, I figured I would update my review. I was an avid and loyal customer to the prior business that was there, Belfiores. Of course, I dont expect things to be similar or stay the same but I didn't expect there to be such a drastic difference. Ive given Dinos the benefit of the doubt by chalking up their lack of whatever to thr fact that they just opened. Since months have gone by, I will not be giving them any more chances. I've given the business about 8 or 9 chances to \"get their sh*t\" together but they have not met the expectations of myself or many others who I brought and who visited separately. 

Im very sad to say this but what pizza place (pizzeria) doesn't serve pizza?!? I learned that Dinos only serves pizza during the lunch hours. I have visited the business a few times around 2pm or so. The counters were bare at that time. I would assume that their pizza hours are from approximately 11 to 11:30am until about 1pm or so. I also learned that they do not make and serve sicilian slices at all except for \"to-go\" orders. I did order a whole pie during my first visit when they didnt have slices available. Unless things have changed, I was not satisfied in the least bit.

During my last visit to get slices, which were not available at 2pm, I asked the waitress why they have set hours for pizza and she couldn't answer. She mentioned that they'll be having an official grand opening soon. I asked if the pizza hours will change with the grand opening and she said no. Since theu didn't have slices available, I opted to get a couple cannolis. What I do like is that Dinos does not fill their cannolis with the cream until you order them. That prevents them from being soggy. I understand that Italian Pastries are a sort of delicacy and so the prices will not be cheap. They serve two different sizes of cannolis; small and large. I assumed the prices would be about $2.25 for a small and about $3.25 for a large. When I was rang up, the price for two large ones came to just under $8! Thats absolutely insane!!! During my past visits and this current one, the pastry case was a little bare. There was a lot of empty space. As time goes by, they seem to fill the case a little more with variety but it still lacks about 50% of the cold case space. Of all the times I gave this business the benefit of the doubt, they were always empty. It was never crowded.  In fact, there wasnt anymore than four people in the restaurant, meaning customers. This business has been open for months now and they still have not yet had a grand opening. In my opinion,  by the time they do have their grand opening,  they would have lost most of their business by these negative things. I will not be giving Dinos another chance at all until after their grand opening.  Maybe by then they would realize that the way they're conducting business is chasing customers away and change some things for the better. This is a business that thrives on being open on the weekends for families that are out and about on the weekend and others. I cant beleive that they choose to be closed on Sundays. I can understand if they're slammed during the week and do good business. A rival business, Romanelli's, is closed on Sundays as well. The difference is that they have the influx of business during the week to do so. They also have they're stuff together and arent loosing business. Dinos is loosing business on an everyday basis and it baffles me as to how they can risk going under by being closed on Sundays. Maybe theyll reckgnkze this and change some things.

The positive things I notice are the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff. The cannoli cream is excellent, although the cream can use a little garnish such as a slice of orange rind or chocolate chips mixed in. The cleaniless of the facility is great. The prior business,  Belfiores, was very dirty! The decor inside is nice as well. That's about all the business has going for it. 

This review is based on factual things and also my personal opinion. Everything in this review is 100% correct.  I give credit where credit is due and the same with constructive criticism."}
{"text":"They were excellent great prices and the food & services were number 1i would highly recommend a go to"}
{"text":"Found out about Dino's from a neighborhood post, went with my family for dinner, was not disappointed, food was delicious, had a Caesar salad and a 16 inch pizza , the crust was amazinggggg, so crispy , not something I come across too often living in AZ.. The staff is super friendly, the only thing I will mention is that they are clearly still putting the finishing touches together on the look and presentation, and are not quite all set up, but they are only open for 3 weeks and they haven't had their official grand opening, but I will definitely be back and recommend it to everyone! I mean at the end of the day its the food and service that matters to me and they are a 10 in both!!!"}
{"text":"I was sold by the smell the second I walked through the door. My dad owns a small business in the area, and this is one of his favorite spots for lunch. It replaced Belfiores, which was very similar to Dino's- Italian deli/bakery/restaurant. I was bummed when we lost Belfiores, but Dinos has it beat.

Family owned with great service, the restaurant offers your classic Italian menu along with the the real-deal Italian pastries and some groceries. 

I had the eggplant parm sub. Being that eggplant parm is one of my all time favorites, I'm a tough critic. It was delicious! The bread on the sandwich was definitely Italian made with that perfect crunch. Bread is the key to a good sandwich, and they nailed it. 

Love supporting small businesses, and this is one I recommend highly!!"}
{"text":"Okay, I am known as 5 star Martta only because I don't give them out the first time,  I will try a restaurant usually two to three times to give it a true 5 star rating.  So, there will be an update. 

I ordered a delivery on a Thursday night at the end of the school year.  I was too tired to cook, but I am also picky about my pizza. This often proves a difficult choice that I usually put off until around 8.  We have tried many pizza places in the area and still have not settled on one place.  I called Dino's after I saw they replaced Belfiore's.  I read some of their reviews.  I liked Belfiore's, but they had been inconsistent with their pizza.  To be fair, their cookies and desserts were great.  I ordered their pizza and wing special and a spaghetti and meatball family meal.  We were going to try them out and see if we would go back.  

The pizza was a tad greasy, but it's pizza!  If it's dry, then it ain't pizza!  I liked the spicy pepperoni.  It brought a smokiness to the flavor that enhanced the mozzarella.  Good pizza.  Really good pizza.  The wings are not much different from another pizza place we frequent.  Not fantastic, but good.  Then, I opened the pan to try the spaghetti and meatballs.  I caught a familiar smell that brought me to tears. 

My father was known for his spaghetti sauce.  He had run a family restaurant and was taught to make the sauce by a little old Italian man.  My dad tinkered with it until it became the fabulous sauce we all loved.  He made it in bulk and sent people home with gallon jugs full of it.  He made many dishes with the sauce, but his lasagna was perfect! The sauce gave it a subtle sweetness that was balanced by a tangy ricotta mix that he blended. People asked for it to be served at gathering and even a wedding.  But it always was the sauce!  I opened that pan and it was my father's sauce.  The recipe was a well guarded secret. How could it be?  I called the restaurant to tell them my story. Nope, we were not related and they had not known my father. Dad has been gone for 4 years on May 4th.  I have not been able to bring myself to make the sauce since his passing.  This was an amazing surprise.  It was a great meal that fed a weary mom and her hungry family.  But it also brought back incredible memories. Thank you Dino's. We shall return to try them again very soon!"}
{"text":"New Italian place, seems to still be trying to get its legs.  We went in to check out the bakery - a bit sparse given all the space they have, but they do have several items to choose from.  Before grabbing a dessert, we sat down for pizza and wings.  Everyone else was ordering pasta and other dishes, so felt a bit odd.  But the wings were great, a nice crispy deep fry with just the right amount of sauce.  Pizza was good, but nothing to rave about.  We grabbed a cannoli to go after - it was good, but not quite the taste I'm used to having... It had too much of something, perhaps a touch too much vanilla extract?  Anyways, I'm gonna give this place the benefit of the doubt and will probably stop in to give another try.  Would like to see 'em really get up and going."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood so it's easy for us to go here.. And will be much easier now that I tried the cannoli.  My God!  Soooo good!  I had two today and am dreading their being closed tomorrow because I need more!"}
{"text":"Updated review- I visited Dino's again this afternoon and was very pleased with my experience this time. Although I did have problem with my stuffed shells being a tad bit under done, I explained my concerns with my server and she fixed the problem quickly with a smile on her face, and when I cashed out at the end she even gave me some delicious cookies for the trouble. Very nice staff, thanks for the tasty food! Will be returning! :) thank you!"}
{"text":"This fantastic gem is more like eating with your family from back east then a Restuarant! I can't get enough of the many outstanding options from Homemade Lasagna, Italian Beef Sandwich on Fresh Baked Roll with Spicy Giardiniera  have I mentioned with White or The How U Doin Pizza, oh my! Let's move to dessert, Yes Cannoli's, Lobster Rolls, Biscotti, Neapolitan  and Pinoli cookies with a nice cup of coffee tops off this wonderful neighborhood experience! Great Date Night or Family gathering! Ask for Vinny tell him How U Doin guy sent you in! Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"On the hunt for some pasta, we found Dino's via the Yelp app. My dates are very particular with their Italian dishes, while I'm pretty much set as long as we've got an Italian sausage in the mix. We didn't know what to expect, but we were starved at 4pm so we kept an open mind.

A quick drive down the street and we were at the strip mall. As you walk in, you see the delicious items available for take away, including cookies, deli meats, cheeses, and the empty cannoli shells. This is when my friend leans over to me and excitedly says \"You know it's legit when they don't fill their cannoli until it's ordered.\" 

We were seated in the empty dining area (it's 4pm, remember? Please don't judge us). The decor is painfully out of date. We began singing some 80's songs over the Frank Sinatra that was playing. Okay, so maybe it was just me singing. We took our time perusing the menu before we could finally make a decision on our foodstuff. Everything sounded good! They brought out some fresh rolls for us, along with our soup and two salads. I highly recommend you request the Italian dressing on your salad!!! GET IT. We actually stopped eating the lettuce portion and decided to fill our bellies with bread sopped with the dressing. No regrets.

I got the capellini with red sauce and sausage. The sausage was fresh, so they actually cook a homemade patty and place it on the pasta. It was pretty good! My other friend got the meat sauce and mushrooms. That was REALLY good!! My other friend had jumped on the baked penne with meatballs. This was about when my tastebuds exploded. The sauce. The cheese. The meat. I die. My Jersey friend said it made her feel right at home, which is no easy feat!

We made room for fresh cannolis.... I don't know how, but we did. Get the chocolate cannoli. They don't do chocolate chips for their original ones, so keep that in mind when making your decision.... Leave the gun, take the chocolate connoli. Sorry, I had to say it.

We left and we couldn't stop raving about the place. I'm fairly certain my friends will actually drive up to visit me more often only so we can go out to dinner. 

Fresh made bread. Fresh sausage. Fresh desserts. So good. 
C'mon now. Get in here."}
{"text":"If you want great pizza this place is a must! Besides delicious pizza the food is great too! Awesome lil family owned mom n pop kinda place! Definitely a must taste!!!"}
{"text":"I had hear good things about this restaurant so I went expecting good food, instead I was seated and sat for over 20 minutes. No one asked if we wanted something to drink never mind take our order. After 3 tables were cleared and re set we left.  I guess they don't need more customers, too bad for them.... We just bought a house in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Update - Birthday Dinner, last night!  My kids wanted to take me out, and I wanted to go back to DIno's, for that Linguini and Clams..(plus I wanted my kids to try Dino's; as we all live in the vicinity)
First off - warm, and yummy bread.  And they brought seconds...
Me - Linguini and Clams, in white sauce.  Amazing!!  (glass of White Zinfandel)
Husband - Grandma's Lasagna.  Delicious!! (an IPA beer)
Daughter - Cajun Pasta w/shrimp.  Perfect!!
Son - Chicken Parmigiana.  Delicious, had enough to take home for leftovers
Son-in-Law - Chicken Parmigiana sandwich.  Must have been delish, as he ate the entire thing.
Grand-daughter (9 months old) - noodles off the table...but she liked 'em. :)

For dessert - we all shared 2 Canolis (sp?)

I am serious.  Forget about Olive Garden.  Dino's is the real deal !!  :)"}
{"text":"Have you been waiting for Belfiore's to reopen?  Forget it, they aren't, but Dino's has opened in its place!  We went there tonight and tried the pizza, salad, bread, ravioli, eggplant Parmesan and Veal Parmesan....all were great.  The service was friendly and prompt. The prices are very affordable.  They have a bakery too.

The wait is over!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. Friendly staff and the owner always ask how our food is every time my family and I visit. The food is always amazing. I have yet to try their pizzas. I usually order a pasta dish (either the ravioli or stuffed shells; drool) and the last time I visited I ordered a Italian beef sammich. I was a bit taken back to see peppers in it, but I took a bite of it anyway, and it was love at first bite. Definitely filling and I was surprised I took my food home. I never do that. 

Overall, not only is the food perfect, it is affordable. The whole restaurant is clean, cozy, and softy plays Sinatra. My only complaint is the windows should be tinted or have better blinds. Why that? Well, when dining in the evening customer's vehicle headlights are blinding and distracting. 

That's all I have to say about Dinos :)"}
{"text":"A new gem. Went for lunch and we were blown away. The eggplant parm was well prepared, reminiscent of Rome. The Greek salad was good quality and with lots of olives. We will definitely be back for dinner. Have to try the veal and the lasagna.     

Came back for veal parm, and it was outstanding. Asked for meat sauce on the pasta, which was excellent."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago Good food is hard to fine. I have had the Italian beef sandwich, the egg plant, linguine,and the veal all very good .
great atmosphere and phenomenal bread"}
{"text":"I remember Dino's on Cave Creek and Peoria in the 80's (Now Big Daddy's). Loved Dino's then. Love it now. Such a taste of authentic upstate New York comfort food.

Easy to criticize anyone's effort, but I truly enjoyed the soft opening. Have had meatballs, pasta, cheeses, delicious salads and fabulous breads. Can't wait to try the pizza and beef on weck. That's right, beef on weck.

Closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"We stopped by Dino's for dinner! Food was fantastic! Pizza great and Chicken Marsala had excellent flavor! Great dessert menu too."}
