{"text":"This is the second time I went to try this place 
Drove down paid for parking only to find a note on the door they decided to change their hours.
Call before you go if your travelling."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, and actually Mexican! You can practice your Spanish with the staff :) I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The tacos (both street and gourmet) ... and the rotisserie chicken. Tired the mango jalape√±o and coconut pineapple sauces - both so delicious. A large dinner for 4 with half a chicken leftover came out to about $20 per person. My favourite new taco spot. Just be aware: currently no liquor license."}
{"text":"I've been anticipating this restaurant to open since I saw the coming soon signs. Recently opened, I dined in to check it out.

Food: They have a selection of rotisserie chicken (pollo rostizado), gourmet tacos and street tacos. They also have imported Mexican soda (grapefruit, pineapple and other flavours). If you sit in, they give you complimentary nachos and salsa verde! I tried the 1/4 chicken which came with broiled potatoes and three tortillas. The chicken was the star of the plate, it is juicy inside and held a pack of sweet and savoury flavour. 
I left the pescado (fish) street taco for last, it came with two pieces of battered fish, onion, cilantro and one tortilla. I guess I left it out too long, as the fish was not buttery and moist inside. 

Service & atmosphere: The staff are friendly and as I was a first timer they explained the items on their menu. If you want to know more about the food, they'd be glad to share their origins. The murals along the walls are painted with beautiful detail, I could not take my eyes off them.

Price: The 1/4 chicken plate and fish taco was $13.27 altogether. Leaving with a full stomach on that price seems fair to me. The next time I come back, will try the gourmet tacos. This restaurant is a welcomed addition to Roncesvalles!"}
{"text":"The tacos were fantastic! Some of the best I have had in Toronto. You can see them cooking everything fresh and the chef even recommended certain salsas. Gourmet Choken Mole Poblano was heaven. If you like tacos, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"The food is good here. The standout was the gourmet fish taco but had a couple of street tacos and they were also good. Will be back to try the rotisserie chicken.

They're clearly still finding their feet as a new restaurant and service wasn't the quickest but   staff were friendly and it's a really welcome addition to the local area."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now, and I really want to love this place. But unfortunately, my experiences have been underwhelming overall. We always order the vegetarian tacos with no cheese, a side of fries and refried beans. Although we have asked that they add a little guac to the tacos in place of the cheese, they always just send an order of guac ($4 for a tiny ramekin, eek!) and then charge us for it, not mentioning it. At first I chalked it up to a language barrier. The second time I specifically said, \"please add the guac instead of the cheese, but not a full order.\" Again, we received a full order, and a $4 charge on the bill, which I disputed and the manager/owner reluctantly removed, saying he'd do it \"this time.\" You would think that restaurants would be accommodating, to keep customers coming back, but I guess not. So the third and fourth times I went, I didn't even bother asking about the miniscule amount of guac, but instead just bit the bullet and ordered a side of guac, along with the refried beans. Last time we went, despite saying \"no cheese\" on any of the food, the refried beans arrived with cheese all over the top, so we had to send it back. They were happy to swap it out but come on. Pay attention.

They offer free chips and salsa while you wait for your food, so last time I asked for a few more (as we had salsa leftover). The waitress brought five more chips and later charged us $1.50 for them. Didn't mention it, just added the charge to the bill. When I asked about it at the end, she basically shrugged and said that's the way it is. Despite the mixup with the cheese on the refried beans, the fact we didn't have any cheese on our tacos, etc., they still had to gouge us on the five tortilla chips. Nice.

On top of this, the tacos are nowhere near as delicious as they were in the beginning. They have changed the tortillas to blue corn, which have a stronger taste, and the veg filling in the tacos is more bland now. Maybe it's tastier with cheese? I will never know.

Overall, this place is mediocre at best, and the service is hit and miss. On top of that, the place leaves your clothes smelling like the food, for days. I had to wash my winter coat because it smelled like taco meat.

Despite this place being in my neighbourhood, I don't think I'll be going back here unless I just want some fries as a quick snack."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food. The chicken mole taco was as good or better than I had in Mexico. My wife said the chicken taco was great too."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood- the selection of salsas are awesome but could be more generous w the chips.  Fish tacos were tasty, fancy mole taco could have been juicer.  Really nice people, will be back for sure and let them get in the rhythm.  Prices were cheap."}
{"text":"Great addition to our neighbourhood. Staff are very friendly and warm. Food is good and very well priced. I also really liked the decor. We ate there on the day it opened, so I look forward to trying the full menu. Hopefully they will get a liquor license soon"}
{"text":"The kind of food you'd be happy to get fat eating.

Just checked this recently-opened place with my brother this afternoon. I had the chicken and pork street tacos and they were both excellent; easily two of the best tacos I've ever had.

The tortillas tasted and had the texture of being made in-house, the flavours of the meat, cilantro, and onions, complemented each other well, and the various flavours of help-yourself salsas brought it all together.

My brother and I split the churros for dessert. They were filled with caramel and topped with tart raspberry compote. Predictably delicious.

The whole bill for the both of us was under $25, so some great value too.

Seriously consider checking these killer tacos out if you like spicy and authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Hands down the best authentic Mexican food I've ever had. I strongly recommend you try the carne gourmet taco. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos. Great value. 

Highly recommend the fish street taco. One of the best tacos I've ever had. 

Love how they have chips and salsa when you sit, and a diverse selection of salsas for your tacos. 

They even have rotisserie chicken which surprised me. It is excellent. 

If you are in the neighbourhood and in the mood for tacos there is no better choice on this street."}
{"text":"Serving portions are huge, tacos are great along with the homemade serve yourself sauce bar. The specialty tacos are large enough to only need 1 or 2 .
Service is great, down to earth, and Cinco is a breath of fresh air compared to some more gentrified taco spots in our city."}
{"text":"My friend loved this restaurant, especially the rotisserie chicken.  However, on the day I went for lunch there was no chicken available.  The service was terrible and the gourmet tacos were hard to eat and not very good.  The music was loud and the garish murals were ghastly.   There is much better Mexican food to be had in Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican tacos.

Came here on a Saturday with a group of 7. Be aware that the restaurant is very small (seats about 30 people). Thankfully we were able to get a reservation and our table was ready once we arrived. 

The menu is just tacos, some chicken dishes and some sides. The only side we got were some fries - they were not great.   They're clearly McCain fries and the only saving grace was this seasoning they put on them. I would not recommend the fries. 

Tacos - We didn't order a lot of the sides and based on the waiter's recommendation everyone got 1 gourmet taco (about $10) and 1 street taco (about $5). The gourmet tacos are wrapped on double soft shells with cheese in between. They're also stuffed with more food. I found 1 of each taco to be the perfect amount to be full and not over eat. I can't recall which ones I had, but no one at the table had any complaints, so I don't think you can go wrong here. The tacos tasted very authentic. Order 1 gourmet and 1 street taco of your choice. 

Be aware they don't have their liquor licence yet. They are in the process of getting it, but for now it's just water and some different pops and juices. 

Last note: they have a \"serve yourself\" set up of salsas. I tried a bit of each and they were great. I just wish the cups they give you to fill them were larger. 

All in, for 1 gourmet and 1 street taco, bill was $16 plus tip. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Good service. Tasty: gourmet beef and chicken. The size is ok, not too small but not big. Nachos offer freely, as six types of sauce."}
{"text":"My friend and i were exploring the Roncy neighborhood on our way to High Park. We were looking to eat something chill, fresh, and not too expensive. We walked pass this Mexican joint and went right back in when we saw how cute the restaurant was and loved the chill vibe! Nachos come to your table complimentary, get the quac, you won't regret it. Selection of free salas at the back for your tacos. We tried the fish, chicken and pork street tacos. Super amazing and fresh and the taco was super loaded! Full off of 2 tacos. Would absolutely recommend this place. Perhaps the best tacos in the city, and I've tried a lot of tacos..."}
{"text":"Authentic, no frills, no improvisations- just a straight reminder of Mexican street food at it's best. All ingredients are actually shipped directly from Mexico. Must try!"}
{"text":"This is, hands-down, the best mexican food place in Toronto! And I would know!  I live in Cuidad de Mexico, DF, and have travelled (with locals) pretty much every corner of Estados Unidos de Mexico!

In Toronto I've tried every single mexican restaurant in the core (no suburbs), including Los Colibris (high end), Caballito, Grand Electric (fusion), etc. etc.

NONE of the above places are as good as this one. None, even the pricey ones! 

Cinco is a very small restaurant and it gets really busy around brunch on weekends. They have a special brunch menu, but their regular one is also available.  The best items on the menu are tacos and they come in two varieties: specialty (lots of goodies) and regular (simple).  Specialty tacos are around $8 - two are enough for the average guy (150lbs), while the regular are around $5 and you'd probably need three to feel full. They also have a 'salsa bar' with different heat salsas - but they are all sooo goood!!!

The service is good but not servile.  When it gets busy sometimes they forget stuff (no free chips), but just remind them. The flavors of the pork belly and specialty pork are to die for!  I pity the people who don't eat the tastiest meat out there because they are missing on an amazing flavor and texture experience.  The chicken is also good, but the pork is waaay better.  In DF, pork Tacos al Pastor are the main street food, and here they are replicated almost exactly.

Now a word for vegans (one nasty review down the screen, scroll down, you'll find it) - JUST KEEP MOVING!  This is not a restaurant for you!  I can't believe the lady who wrote the review ordered the tacos without meat AND without cheese!!!??? What's left? NOTHING - that's what!  The slow cooked meat with it's juices and mixed with the melted cheese, both soaking into the corny (see what I did there) tortilla is the essence of the food experience here.  During my time in Mexico I didn't meet a single local vegetarian/vegan.  That should tell you about the essence of the cuisine. 

Do yourself a favor and come to this restaurant and eat the dishes as they are written in the menu (no substitutions!) - your taste buds will thank you for hours."}
{"text":"Popped into this place around noon and it was absolutely packed. Had a quick look at the menu and thought it was quite nice. We were doing a little food tour on Roncy so didn't want to consume a full meal before we had a chance to sample all of the beautiful offering that the local shops had on offer. 

We walked the stretched and managed find find a few small things to munch on. 

After the walk back, I suggested we get some tacos at Cinco. 

Was provided some awesome tortilla chips at no cost. They had a wide selection of salas at no additional cost as well which was very nice. 

Before I forget, the waitress was exceptional. She had notice that we had popped in earlier and was surprised to see us back a couple hours later. 

The food was spectacular. I ordered the mixed pork 'gourmet' taco - consisting of pork belly, loin and some other delicious ingredients ~$8 and change. My SO ordered the three for $10 and got the fish (2) and beef (1). 

Quite honestly, the food here is delicious and worth the wait. Yes we were there off peak hours and so not everything would have been prepared quickly - so there was a bit of a wait - but it was really delicious (almost as good as Seven Lives in Kensington Market. 

The decor was also very nice and just generally a great experience."}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gem at the south side of Roncesvalles. Authentic street tacos and some amazing gourmet varieties too. Everything tasted really fresh and service was prompt and efficient. They also have a ton of homemade salsas that you can top your taco with as you like. Definitely recommend. It's worth a trip."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for tacos, so I thought I would try this newly opened place in Roncesvalles. Terribly disappointed. The whole place was smoky and smelt like a greasy deep fryer - to the point my clothes and my hair are going to smell all day now... the tacos were underwhelming, didn't even come warm. Payment took forever. Was standing in line trying to pay for almost 15 minutes. The owner couldn't figure out how to split the cheque between my friend and I, so he just said \"I don't know how\" and asked if I could pay it all - very awkward and unprofessional. Staff were not friendly and didn't come to check on our table once, despite water being empty etc. Won't be going back, and don't recommend you do either."}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexican restaurant in Toronto. Great quality food and a great atmosphere. The tacos are really good and they prepare their fresh salsas daily.  
They just started serving brunch and I loved it too!"}
{"text":"I have to stop laughing first before I can write my review. Did someone actually write a review saying this place is terrible, but has been there 4 times & keeps going back. I know if I don't like a place I will keep going..... You had to wash your jacket because it smelled like meat after I left wtf lol
Sorry but my head hurts just reading that review it was so ridiculous.

The food here was great, the meat had a nice smokey grilled flavour, & the blue corn tortillas tasted like....yes I'm sure you guessed it, corn tortillas. 
My wife & I got a couple of the specialty tacos, a regular chicken taco, and a chicken quesadilla. 
Ooops almost forgot the $4 homemade guacamole we got that was delicious. $4 well spent. 
They have a large variety of home made sauces you can choose from, to put on your tacos. 
We live in Bloor West Village, there is a place near us called Mad Mexican, it's ok, but I found it very underwhelming. We were excited for Cinco to open, and they did not disappoint. It's a bit further drive for us, but that's ok, Cinco will definitely be our go to for Mexican food from now on."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful lunch at Cinco during the Cinco de Mayo gourmet taco special. I arrived just before the lunch crowd and the server was very nice to explain all the specials to me. I ordered both Al pastor (pork) & Marisco (seafood) tacos. Both were very good, packed with flavour and very balanced. Pro tip, try all the different sauce in the back with the tacos. The extra heat makes a big difference.
I will come again for their brunch specials."}
{"text":"We're pretty picky when it comes to restaurants: there are too many good places out there to eat again at any places that are any less than awesome.

We'll definely be coming back here. 

The pros:
- good quality food at a great price
- an 'authentic' feel to it
- the street style fish taco: 10/10
- the gourmet pork belly taco: 10/10
- the gourmet chicken mole taco: 9/10
- nicest wait staff

The cons:
- we weren't hungry enough to order more"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos at a reasonable price! This is a new restaurant and we randomly walked in and we're pleasantly surprised. Staff is friendly and tacos are innovative! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved the food. Everything we had tasted fresh and delicious. Such a great addition to the neighborhood. We will definitely be regulars. Looking forward to them getting a liquor license."}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky when it comes to tacos but this place did not disappoint. I had the chicken and fish street tacos and they were sooooooooooooo good! The tacos are packed with flavor but I added the smoked chipotle and peligrosa salsa for an extra kick. Overall great service, food and experience!"}
{"text":"Although I went here for dinner a few weeks ago and they did not have any chicken ready, I was happy enough to try other items in the menu and I was not disappointed! Good, authentic Mexican street tacos. I was happy to see they use two tortillas for each taco, not common at many other taco joints around Toronto.
The salsa station is a great touch and good way to flavour your tacos to your liking. 
Churros for dessert were delicious and a great way to end the meal. 
Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this neighbourhood space after watching them renovate for quite some time and eagerly waiting for their opening.

We arrived fairly late in their service and they were happy to seat us. The interior is very comfortable, and it might make a great casual date spot (although they really need a liquor license). The service was very friendly, and tour server was happy to answer any questions we had about the menu.

We were informed that they were unfortunately out of the gourmet seafood (marisco) taco, so I ordered the gourmet vegetarian tacos, while my partner ordered a sampling of the smaller street tacos. All of the ingredients were high quality, and everything seemed fairly fresh. We also appreciated the salsa bar and enjoyed sampling several varieties. We ultimately weren't blown away by the tacos. They were all tasty, but a little bit more subdued than many of the other tacos you might find in the city, with fairly standard toppings. Our sides of chips and guacamole and fried potatoes were both quite good. Prices were reasonable and the portions are substantial. 

A nice restaurant, but I have to admit that a liquor license would improve the experience substantially. This is a cozy casual place I would have loved to hang out and enjoy a drink and a few tacos at over an hour or two, and while the tacos were good, I felt there was just a slight missed opportunity here."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, the salsas are amazing too! You can get your own selection of unlimited salsas, they taste like real Mexican ones. I recommend it. The service is on the slow side but they make it up with the delicious tacos! Price wise is so so, $8.00 for one taco is a bit much.. they are good though!"}
