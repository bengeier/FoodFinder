{"text":"The food is prepared quickly and is extreamly tasty. The staff are also very friendly people and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great gyros, pitas, and daily specials in addition to the hot dogs and sausages. My favorite is the turkey pita with honey mustard. If you call in an order, you can be through in a minute."}
{"text":"This place serves small portions. I ordered the jumbo gyro and it wasnt even the size of a normal gyro at other places..."}
{"text":"I've tried the Italian sausage and classic gyro from Hounds, and both were amazing. The sausage had a little bit of spice, but it wasn't overwhelming. The sweet pepper and onions complimented it perfectly! The gyro was incredible as well! There was a ton of meat on it, and the sauce was great. Not only was the food delicious, the service was great as well. They were so friendly. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here after Browns Training Camp. Went her off the reviews and had a taste for some hot dogs. I got a chili dog and regular hot dog. The chili dog was great! The regular hot dog was good too. If I would have known though I would have ordered 2 chili dogs! My family ordered the gyros. They got one jumbo and I regular. The jumbo was suppose to have more meat. It looked about the same as the regular. That's the only complaint. They both loved it. Especially the cucumber sauce. We'd go back!"}
{"text":"I lived in the area for almost 10 years. I'm so upset I never gave this place a chance until recently. Honestly, I can not get enough of it. The owners are sweet and very welcoming. The food is fantastic. It's better than going downtown and playing 6 bucks for just one sausage pepper and onion from those carts. Seriously have to stop and get a hot dog from this place."}
{"text":"I saw this place one day lit up at night and was curious. I always passed it and never stopped cause I was hesitant, I mean it's a little hut in the middle of a parking lot kinda weird. I finally couldn't resist, I love hot dogs! Boy, am I glad I stopped, SUCH a good dog, at a crazy reasonable price! Delicious!!! Must stop if in the area."}
{"text":"Saw it driving by. Decided to stop. Very friendly, very tasty. Will visit again. We had chili cheese dogs and gyros. Both were very good."}
{"text":"you cannot beat the service at this place .. what a wonderful & friendly Greek couple! .. the best 4 dollar gyro in the city .. you cannot beat the food for the prices at this joint .. it looks like it was once an old Fotomat .. very small drive up joint but it is well worth it both for the price & the conversation you get at the window .. will not take long for them to learn your name & remember what your favorite items are either .. love this place!"}
{"text":"Best little place in the area. 2 drive thru windows and best food for the price. All fresh made daily food! Stop for a snack or lunch. Since finding this place I only eat lunch here everyday. Very friendly people and always willing to go the extra mile for you! Stop and see for yourself then you too will be hooked!!"}
{"text":"Had the gyro. Everything was delicious and high-quality, from the bread, the meat and the sauce! Best Gyro I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"Awesome gyros. Pita bread had excellent grill marks. The taziki sauce is homemade best sauce I ever had on a gyro. Best value for the money meat piled high. Not long of a wait either for a Saturday. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great People! Great Food! Stoped up there today and was pleasantly greeted by the owner and wife."}
{"text":"Was playing a softball game nearby and needed something quick and yummy- this place was the bomb.  Doesn't look like much from the outside but thank goodness Yelp always points me in the right direction.  Get the chili cheese dog nom nom nom"}
{"text":"A very cool little drive thru gyro/hotdog/coffee stand. I'm not giving 5 stars because I didn't see well seasoned fries. I always eat them with my gyro. That sounds mean. I may change this rating since he has Snyders BBQ chips in leu of fries."}
