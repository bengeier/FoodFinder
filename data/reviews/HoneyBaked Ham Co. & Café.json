{"text":"Won't go back to the Solon Honey baked ham store again!  Today is Good Friday, 2 days before Easter, the line is out the door as you'd expect, but  only 4 employees working at snails pace the Solon store. None seem in any hurry to help the growing crowd, that's for sure.   One female employee with long hair extensions seems completely oblivious (and looks bored). She took 3 breaks in my 35 minute wait to pour herself a cup of Sprite and stand around sipping it leaning on the counter staring at the floor while approx 70 people waiting in line!  She seems startled when a cashier asks her to go get a ham from the back. Really bad service!   Tried to call the phone number to reach a manager, but the phone number on receipt 440-349-2208 is not a working number!  Owner/Management - take a hint from the Fairlawn store - they always handle huge crowds well - you can see the dozen or so employees running and providing speedy service on a busy day like today."}
{"text":"Just got ham with vip customer coupon.  No glaze, so sad. Soggy and no sweet crunch, $30 wasted."}
{"text":"Food is great, but just like getting a ham during the holidays if you go for lunch during lunch hours there's a line and it's slow going.  So food and service good, but poorly managed to match staff to walk in customers."}
{"text":"Been standing in line for an hour and a half to pick up a ham I ordered a week ago. There is no difference in the line for those that pre-ordered or those that are just now getting their ham for tomorrow. Then the check out line is double the length because they have 2 people checking out 100 people with digital coupons that won't scan.  Get your shit together. You have maybe 3 holidays all year you need to staff up. I will NEVER again waste half my day waiting for a ham. Totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"Our office ordered Honey Baked Ham today for lunch and the food was disgusting.  Two employees threw theirs in the garbage of which one was me.  Ham was fatty and just old tasting.  They used to have the BEST ham salad and now it is not edible.  Big chunks of ham and fat and the taste is just awful.  Do not know why they changed a good thing unless it was to save money and cut back on cost and use the leftover disgusting fatty pieces of meat for it.  Will never ever go back and waste my money there again."}
{"text":"So this place moved from the Giant Eagle Plaza to being slighly more visible, in the same strip mall as Chipotle. Love the food here, fresh and delicious. Lettuce is crisp, tomatoes are red, ham is piled high.Specially enjoy the honey mustard w/ ham on an egg knot roll (okay it's really challah bread, is it wrong to eat ham & cheese on challah bread?) and pasta salad..   This restaurant really improved in appearance also, with a new separate dining room (they will bring the food to your table after you order at the counter), some flat screen tv's and dark wood. They also sell hams, pies and fixin's you can take home and make your own banquet meal.  However, prices are pretty steep (much higher than you'd pay for a combo meal at Applebee's or Subway, though the quality is better too). Never seems that busy at lunch, which is a little surprising given the nicer digs.  If you go not a lunch, it can be a while waiting at the counter for someone to come out and wait on you."}
{"text":"Fast service. Kind staff. Yummy sandwich!!! Better than anything I could have picked within 15 miles for a quick, delicious sandwich. I had the classic Tavern Club. Very fresh. Grateful I took the chance and came in! Bought a soup mix and some ham for later as well. Dinner is now taken care of too!"}
