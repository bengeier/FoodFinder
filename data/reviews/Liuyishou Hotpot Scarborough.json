{"text":"One star for horrible service. My hungry friends and I had high expectations for this place. However, the server never came to actually take our orders. We weren't even given a glass of water. We were waiting for 20 minutes and when the server finally came around, he turned to the people at the table next to us to grab their orders first. We arrived there a good 17 minutes before they did. Needless to say, we were disappointed and had to leave as we were so hungry :("}
{"text":"I love Chinese hotpot so much,and this one is the best one in Scarborough, all meats and vegetables are all fresh, I have been there several times, I really recommend this restaurant, but when they really busy our order usually take a long time ,and you better ask your waitress again and again, but anyway I love it so much"}
{"text":"I love hot pot and I have been trying many different hot pot restaurant. This place so far is the best one. Good quality of food, reasonable price, excellent service."}
{"text":"Fresh food, seafood was especially good!  We ordered freshly squeezed kiwi juice. I would like try their prune drink next time. Other than the hot pot food, the fried bun was really good!  Staff were very friendly. The place was clean.  My number one hot pot place so far! It would be better if the meat was sliced thinner!  Four stars for staff"}
