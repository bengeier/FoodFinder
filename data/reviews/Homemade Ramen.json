{"text":"Poor service, menu very unclear as well. Appetizers way after main served, and all of which came out barely warm. One of the worst tasting green onion pancakes in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Just OK. Definitely not Ramen. Noodles are fresh but nothing that makes this place outstanding in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I was so satisfied after this meal.  Very authentic and very fresh.  I got the braised beef ramen. The pulled noodles are chewy and delicious, and the broth is light and flavoured perfectly. These noodles are not for everyone. My friend did not enjoy it because he enjoys intense flavours in his food. When you're having this type of Chinese style soup noodle, it's going to be light tasting. Very clean restaurant, and fast service."}
{"text":"The place is very clean and the staff were very nice. The spring rolls come with a great tangy sauce to dip and the pulled noodles were delicious."}
{"text":"It was better than I expected, I finished two bowls of noodles and the prices were good. Would come here next time when I'm craving noodles"}
{"text":"Best Lanzhou noodles in Toronto.   I lived Downtown at lakeshore last year, I heard there is a Lanzhou noodles opening at spading and Dundas. I was so excited to try out this restaurant since I've always be a fan of ramen especially Lanzhou ramen.   So I tried this place roughly at new year, I'm so glad that it didn't disappoint me. This place is like my home. The ramen is delicious and authentic. The waiters are very friendly. I just love this place.    However, sadly I moved to North York this year and cannot go there on a daily basis, but every time I'm downtown I will try to eat there. I miss that place so much.   I recommended this place to everyone I known. But I don't want everybody to know that place cuz I don't want it to be crowded someday.   I just hope that everything goes well with the restaurant so they can open one at North York!"}
{"text":"Legit Chinese sliced noodles place, with chef hand making noodles on the spot. Spacious shop where it's cleaner and brighter in comparison with other places in China town. A bit disappointed with the spicy noodles as it's not spicy at all, at least not enough for me, yet the chili oil provided on the table is not the same kind of spice they use for the soup. Overall happy with the legit and comforting food."}
{"text":"Hand pulled noodles are delicious & chewy! We ordered the noodle bowl w spicy Szechuan minced pork. Also tried the"}
{"text":"Not great Ramen, at least not in the Japanese sense. More like pho than the ramen I'm familiar with. Weak broth with very few ingredients - green onion, small amount of sliced beef and a tiny bit of daikon."}
{"text":"Pass by spotted the restaurant menu seems changed. I decided to give it another taste test. Ramen is actually Chinese La-Mein ( handmade pull noodle ). The texture of the noodle seems significant improved and delicious. No more over kill salts in both, the noodles and the soups. This time, I couldn't believe I actually empty entire bowl even though I wasn't really hungry.   One thing I hope the chef would re-adjust the ingredient a little by shredding those Daikon ( radish ) then soak in cold water before serve on top of the hot soup bowl instead of slices and dump it in the bowl or simply replace it with Chinese vegetable.  Definitely will be back after today' visit."}
{"text":"I was in the area and thought I would drop in for some yummy handmade ramen. This is Chinese style ramen not Japanese style ramen.   It's been years since I had authentic Chinese style ramen, especially Lanzhou style noodles.   The appetizer was ok. Wouldn't recommend getting it, might as well stick to the noodles. The appetizers we got was overly soy sauced or swimming in vinegar taste.   The ramen noodles with beef was definitely a good start. The noodles tasted delicious and had the right consistency and was super long. The soup itself while flavourful was a little too salty and didn't quite capture the Lanzhou authentic taste. But I give them points for trying.   The sliced noodles with lamb was delicious. My favourite for sure. The noodles was chewy but not overly so and you can clearly tell it was handmade.   Overall, go for the noodles and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great hand pulled noodles. Broth (both the clear and BBQ or \"hongshao\" versions) tastes great to me but definitely lighter and more subtle than similar versions at other shops, which to me is a plus since most rely on MSG or stock base (not necessarily a bad thing if not heavy handed). The lighter flavoring can also describe the lamb skewer, which are adorned with just a dusting of cumin seasoning - generally tasty and the meat is tender, though more time on the charcoal would have developed more flavor. The beef pancake was a little disappointing - not a whole lot of beef and pancake, though flaky on the outside, was a little gummy inside. Service and decor is standard for newer Chinese restaurant these days. Prices are very reasonable - $8 for most noodle soups, $4 for a bottle of Qingdoa. Overall, a good meal and will repeat and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Really good portions and price for the quality you get. Homemade Ramen is one of my go-to's whenever I'm craving a good bowl of noodles near campus -- and service is also always exceptional, which makes me wanting to visit again every time! Try their lamb skewers and pulled braised beef ramen, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The moment I stepped in the restaurant they spoke to me in mandarin and I knew I came to the right place. The food is good, though not great, it is much better than the rest of Chinese restaurant in China Town."}
{"text":"I had the pulled noodles with beef brisket and I would definitely return to this restaurant. It was so satisfying when I had the Ramen craving. The customer service was good and the food was prepared quickly. I would recommended this place."}
{"text":"Pretty OK, went for lunch, ramen bowl was filled with chopped carrots and large chopped beef cubes, what is this? Beef stew? Is a shame because the noodle itself was good but broth and everything else was mediocre at best"}
{"text":"Love the noodles here. I always get the second item on the menu. We tried the deep fried taro too, which was really good and surprisingly not that greasy. If you are getting the spinach side dish, do not bother packing it to go. It does not hold well in the fridge."}
{"text":"The ramen is authentic and the soup has good flavor.  Their hot chilli pepper dishes won't send you to the ER.  Just enough kick to warm you up in the harsh Canadian winter months.  This is not a place for quiet conversations.  The process of making hand stretched noodles creates a lot noise and the dinning area is cramped.  But the food is worth it for me to tolerate the small inconvenience."}
{"text":"Food is great. Highly recommend their Spinach Salad (well, this is the only one place offering this dish). I can have this Spinach Salad every day, I guess. The spicy and sour sauce is super tasty, and the glass noodles absorbs all the flavours, the cashew on top adds extra texture. Brilliant combination.  Cold noodles is also a good option, but Spinach Salad stands out. Hand-pulled noodles is good, but I prefer the stir fried noodles.   Not recommend: Silicon pancake tastes like deep fried dough, too greasy to have a second bite."}
{"text":"My very picky 14 year old son was almost licking the bowl.  The noodles were tender and delicious. We are visiting from Chicago and cannot even come close to this in either of our asian neighborhoods.  The noodle dishes were fantastic, the dumplings were not great, greasy and bland.  It was really cool to watch the noodles being stretched by hand in front of us. The method of ordering, and the service were slightly intimidating but once we dug in we got over it quickly. Oh and what a crazy bargain too, spent like $30 on din for 3 with appetizers"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday.  Atmosphere/decor, the place is okay for a Chinese restaurant, nothing fancy, but it is clean and with okay decor.  It doesn't seat a lot of people, so if busy, expect a wait (I'd estimate 30 customers).  Note that even though it is ramen, it is Chinese noodles, not Japanese ramen.  If you sit close to the back of the restaurant, you can see and hear them making Chinese noodles by pounding it against the table to stretch out the dough.  It is neat to see if you never have, although the sound gets a bit annoying.  Food, I thought they food was good.  The portion is deceiving since the bowl looks empty, but the noodles are lumped into a ball, so you do get a lot of noodles.  Service, typical Chinese service, don't expect too much in terms of them coming back to ask you for orders, how you like your food, refills, etc.  You will likely have to flag down the waitress which is normal to me in Chinese establishments.  Cost, the bowl of noodles set me back $8 plus tax and tip on top which I thought was an okay deal.  I may come back to try out some of the other noodles that they have, but probably not any time soon."}
{"text":"One of the waitress have expressionless mean looking face throw plates on the table. Other waitresses were better and nicer."}
{"text":"Wow!  Seeing the guy hand pulling of the noodles was really impressive.   I think I've only seen that on TV before.  And what amazing noodles they were.  Absolutely perfect for the soup.  We ordered two bowls with chicken and one with beef.  The beef broth had a little more depth, but both were delicious.   Bowls were cheap and huge. We would have had plenty to take home for the next day if only we were not on vacation and could have.    Despite having plenty of soup, we also sampled the scallion pancakes, dumplings and cucumber salad.   Cucumbers were great.  Pretty spicy though.  The pancakes and dumplings just ok, but the noodles were so good that this place gets 5 stars easily anyway.   We had fast, friendly service too.  Very attentive to the kids (and adults).   I wish we had a local noodle house like this that we could go to all the time."}
{"text":"Finally a real Chinese Ramen place in the downtown area. I had the classic ramen, and the hand-pulled noodles (done on the spot) have a great consistency and texture.  The soup base tastes very authentic too.   I always order the lamb kebab and the lotus root appetizer too.  The lamb kebab is so fragrant with all those spices typical from western China (a tiny bit too spicy for me, tho).  And the lotus root is a great side for the whole meal with its crunchiness."}
{"text":"Got this sudden crave for handmade pulled noodle, came to this relatively new place for lunch.  Interior looks clean but feel a bit tight inside, stairway to washroom has a very funny smell of bug spray.  Decided to try pulled noodle with braised beef and pig tripe in chilly sauce.  The noodle has the crunchy texture that I like for Northern style noodle, the menu said spicy but I don't taste any spice at all.  It tastes rather light and no depth on the flavour, but the highlight is the noodle which is quite yummy.  However, meat portion tends to be inadequate, and appetizer dish is pricy.  Pig tripe in chilly oil is supposed to be hot and spicy, but again I don't taste much kick and it tastes more sour than spicy, big disappointment.  Service is typical Chinatown service which is robotic and efficient, but not friendly.   Overall I give them credit for pulling off their speciality, which is hand pulled noodle.  Although I work nearby, I don't see myself coming here for lunch often.  Might revisit later when I have sudden crave for hand pulled noodle.  3/5"}
{"text":"Popular Chinese noodle location, I got spicy beef ramen. Fast turnover, quick eats. Pretty cheap food, probably could get out with less than 11 bucks for a meal. The food took a bit to come, we waited 15-20 minutes. Good texture on the noodles, mean was tender. The dish was steaming hot! The soup lacked depth, mostly just salt. They must lid it up with msg, I left very thirsty."}
{"text":"Came on the recommendation of Chinese friends and this place did not disappoint.   Although the name of the restaurant confusingly uses the Japanese term for noodles (ramen), what's actually on offer are Chinese hand-pulled and knife-cut noodles, both specialties of northwestern China. It's nice to see downtown Chinatown offering options beyond Cantonese.   The lamb stir-fried pulled noodles were solid. The noodles had that fresh-made chew and a nice wheat flavour; while they aren't the best noodles I've ever had, they match up to what you'd find at a decent pulled noodle spot in China. (For Toronto, this is really saying something!) For those that aren't familiar with this cuisine, the noodles can be enhanced with a slug or two of black rice vinegar and chili oil, both found on the table.  The braised beef knife-cut noodles were also very well-executed. Good broth, thick, chewy noodles, and falling-apart-tender beef. I'm sure fans of this dish would enjoy it here.   Will definitely be back and would recommend this as the best pulled noodles I've tried in Toronto. (i.e. better than Magic Noodle)."}
{"text":"A somewhat inconspicuous, fresh noodle restaurant in Chinatown.  I ordered the sliced noodles with braised pork, while my friend had the pulled noodles with braised beef, and we shared the some sort of fried spicy chicken.  Broth was nice, noodles were fresh, chicken was nice and crispy.  Nothing really special to fawn over this place, but nothing terrible about it to throw a hissy fit.  My only \"beef\" is that the menu is huge.  Great for variety, but it likely means they don't really do anything particularly spectacular."}
{"text":"The best part of this meal was watching the hand-pulling noodle process! I'm glad that this in plain sight of the dining room.  Otherwise, the meal was okay. This is not Japanese ramen-- in truth, it was more similar to pho, but with chewier noodles. Although the broth was delicious, the beef was a bit too fatty and overcooked for my liking.  Tips for the restaurant owner: turn on some music, get rid of the Winnie the Pooh towel in the basement, and pay your overworked staff more so that they look like they're enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"With fresh pulled and sliced noodles this place hits authenticity on the dot. While some of the appetizers might not be as promising, the noodles are well worth it. Can't go wrong dropping by this place!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place.  They are making the ramen in the back and so very fresh.  So this is chinese ramen and presented like home style.  Compared to Kinton, or Hokkaido Ramen places, I much much prefer this.  Kinton and Hokkaido feels formulaic and urban versus Homemade Ramen which feels authentic and country.   K and H are good too, I go there too and enjoy them.    Much more variety of ramen here from pulled (round) to sliced (flat).  I like the sliced noodle soup with beef brisket (#1202 on the menu) - though it indicates 1 pepper rating, it is not spicy at all.  #1201 has no pepper rating and is similar but sliced beef instead of beef chunks.   I like the sliced noodles because I like noodles and the eating experience of a spoonful is, well, satisfying.  Of course, the soup base is also important and tasty.  Unlike the japanese places that offer different soup bases, there only seems to be one here but it is good and no need to have to make another decision. But there are cold noodles, stir fried noodles, ..  - extensive menu.    I was away for two years from Toronto and this was the place I wanted to eat at first when I got back.  My \"go to\" place."}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant is slightly misleading. They serve Chinese-style hand pulled noodles (lamian), not japanese ramen. In any case, was glad to see a new noodle joint in the neighbourhood. When we walked in, we saw a guy in the back whipping and twisting the dough. Good to know the noodles were made fresh! We tried the hand pulled ramen with braised beef and the sliced noodles with tomato and eggs. The noodles in the braised beef were fresh and had a good chew to it but the soup base/contents were a little too basic for my liking. It had a strong taste but the flavours weren't very complex/rich (read: heavy MSG soup).If you're debating which type of noodle to get, I'd recommend the sliced over the house noodles. We also tried the mutton skewer and the cook sweet wine and milk peanut raisin sesame for dessert. Skewer was good, dessert was an interesting combo of ingredients and it tasted ok but I don't think it would be for everyone.  Service was attentive, staff spoke decent English, prices were reasonable and noodles were fresh."}
{"text":"I love Asian noodles, especially the handmade kind and I really wanted to love this place but very underwhelming experience. Ordered 3 appetizers - sliced beef and ox tongue in chilli sauce and jellyfish were great! Fried dumplings were ridiculously bad. Tiny and no filling. Ordered 2 bowls of noodles - braised beef and spicy pork meat sauce. Firstly, all the noodles were great. Firm and flavourful. The braised beef broth had a very ginsing/medicinal flavour that I did not enjoy. Some will. Just a personal preference. The spicy pork meat sauce was a pool of salty grease. Worst part of this meal and the reason I will never go back is the basement/bathrooms. Damp, smelled like a sewer and filthy dirty!!!"}
{"text":"Not really ramen, at least not the flavorful Japanese broth I'm used to. Cheap but low quality meat is used and no one at the table was particularly fond of it. Two of my friends had stomach aches the whole night after eating here."}
{"text":"As we left the waiter poured my half drinken tea onto the table and proceeded to wipe the table with it!!!!!!!!! WTFFF.   I cannot believe my eyes!!!!!!   Please Stay Away!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed. Nothing like fresh ramen noodles made to order. I had #102, ramen with braised beef. The beef had chunks of fat on it, but I like that. Tasty, perfect consistency, fair price. Recommended."}
{"text":"We ordered hot and sour soup and two bowls of noodles. I first tried that soup, it tasted really good, ingredients were fresh, not too hot and the thickness was just right. As I was saying how good it tasted... I bit into a small piece of rock! I spit it out and immediately I lost all my appetite, I couldn't tell how the rest of the food tasted like. I was lucky I didn't crack my tooth. The staff of course apologized and took that soup off our bill as I didn't want another bowl. It was an really awful experience."}
{"text":"It was my first time ever trying ramen noodles. The people who served us ( there were 2 ) were extremely kind and took the time to explain the different dishes on the menu. Everything was serve quickly and was fresh and tasty. The noodles were extremely fresh and tasty. The broth was very light but flavorful. I had veggies with my ramen noodles with beef added. I wasn't really keen on the added beef it was cold and pretty bland. Other then that everything was great. They kept my tea topped off and they were very kind and friendly."}
{"text":"Decent lanzhou noodle, I think the broth is a bit bland and not as aromatic as other lanzhou noodle though(tried it from bf's bowl). The hand pulled noodle itself taste alright, I've had better ones from other noodle shops in east toronto. The hot and sour noodle was pretty good, the sour is not from vinegar or lemon, it is from the fresh tomato and some preserved vegetable. It is almost vegetarian with not much minced pork.   The portion is a lot for the price. Decent service and atmosphere. it is nice to have a Lanzhou style noodle shop at downtown.   Like other reviews pointed out, they serve Chinese noodle, not Japanese. Ramen is pulled noodle, doesn't specifically represent Japanese style noodle. Chinese broth is usually lighter compare to the thick salty creamy Japanese broth. Lanzhou noodle is just a type of noodle soup from China, there's many other style too."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The servers were inattentive, they were way less attentive to my table compared to others. I didn't have enough Canadian dollars but didn't want to pay with card because of the fee they charge and the additional international fee I would be charged. I ended up paying cash (American) and they charged me an extra $7 because I wasn't using Canadian dollars. They said that it was dollar for dollar, which it's not, and when I tried talking to them about it they said it was because they need to exchange the money, I understand it'll cost them money to exchange the currency but charging me an extra $7 seems ridiculous to me."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place and have been walking by it for years.  The lotus appetizer was good and had a lot of flavour. The mutton/skewers were decent, but there was a bit too much dry spices on it. The braised beef noodles and stir fry noodles were fantastic. Both were hand-pulled, came with veggies and were both delicious. Coming back for sure!   Tip - Not a Japanese ramen restaurant"}
{"text":"This place was pretty crowded when we came here on a Friday night. I ordered the tan tan noodles and my friends each ordered a bowl of sliced noodles and a million side dishes, way too much for three people. I really liked their small plates/cold dishes . I especially recommend the lamb skewers! Generous portions and well seasoned. The noodles weren't bad but nothing special. I kinda expected a different style of tantan noodles, this one wasn't spicy nor had any nut butter. It was a bit bland before I added sauce to it. My friends felt the same about their beef noodles, they had to add a lot of vinegar and chilli oil, as they thought it was rather bland. I did really like the texture of the ramen noodles, I peferred it much better than my friends sliced noodles. In the end, I still enjoyed the food here, and the prices are really reasonable, would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I ordered a vegetable ramen. The noodles were great. They had a nice texture/chew to them. Unfortunately, I felt like the broth was really lacking flavour. Good noodles can only go so far on their own. They need to be surrounded by a flavourful broth for it to be a well rounded dish, in my opinion.   The \"snack\" section of the menu was made of fun small dishes you could order to supplement your main. We ordered two snacks and were not disappointed.   I didn't notice until maybe halfway through the meal but you can watch the chef making noodles by hand and it was quite impressive!   The service was not great. We waited quite a while to ask for refills of our tea - the restaurant was busy in their defense."}
{"text":"Clarification: Lamian (Mandarin) Ramen (Japanese) and Ramyun/Ramyeon (Korean) all refer to \"pulled noodles\" that originate from the Chinese LaMian. I'm not sure why they chose to add the English translation \"homemade ramen\" under their Chinese sign that says \"Lan Zhou La mian\" because it'll confuse westerners. Japanese ramen usually has a much fattier broth, and Chinese Lamian has a clearer broth, and the noodles are usually hand-pulled.  The food here is pretty good, especially the hand pulled noodles with beef, and the scallion pancake sandwich with beef. The ambiance is not great if you plan on taking a date here.  PS: LanZhou is a city in China"}
{"text":"Located in China Town this small noodle place is a little gem.  The noodles here are fresh as you can see/hear the worker banging the noodles against the counter and twisting it. Pretty cool to see that.  I got the Pulled Braised beef raman which was amazing the soup base was perfect with a little spice to it.  The slice beef with pickled cabbage was good too, the soup base was very clear and tasty. Portion was generous as well.  Will have to come back when it gets colder outside. Looking forward to it."}
{"text":"The hand-torn noodle is better than the homemade ramen. This is a must stop in Chinatown. With some added hot oil the lamb hand-torn noodle dish along with the pork rib noodles were amazing."}
{"text":"The name Homemade Ramen is a misnomer and may mislead some into thinking this is a purveyor of Japanese ramen.  This is however a Chinese hand pulled noodle establishment. Was this an honest mistake or a sly marketing strategy to attract unsuspecting eaters...mmm, semantics I guess?  Any who, I've walked by this place more times I care to count and decided to stop in this time for lunch. Ordered their spicy beef noodle soup. The homemade noodles were cooked to al denté and the bite size pieces of beef brisket fork tender. However the spicy beef broth was such a disappointment. There wasn't a rich deep beefy flavour one would expect from hours of simmering beef-bones and spices. The taste felt subdued and flat with a strong presence of MSG.  Despite adding chili oil, the bowl of noodle soup was already DOA...wah, wah."}
{"text":"I had the Chinese ramen noodles here and it was a very good meal! My friend from China told me about these noodle stretching dudes from his area of China, so I had to try it. Nice consistency to the noodles. They did taste fresh too! Too bad I didn't get the soup and ramen in a bowl as that's what most people were ordering, oops! The hot sauce was nice and richly spicy and the container was clean and sparkled, which is a nice break from some of them which I use but don't like to look at too closely. The soy sauce looked appetizing too, but my plate of noodles was perfectly salted so I didn't need any. My dish was about $10 plus a toonie tip. It was fun to watch the guy behind the counter stretch and smack around the noodles while I ate as well. The team of servers looked smart in their matching outfits with an obvious tip of the hat to Japanese restaurants which was very appealing and easy on the eyes. I'm not entirely convinced their dishes are better than Kings across the street, as the noodles are only one element of the dish, but I will be back to try the ramen another day (and bring my mainlander friend)."}
{"text":"It was crowded and thought we couldn't go wrong but I guess it depends on your past experiences elsewhere etc.   Ordered a homemade beef noodle to share and lots of other small side dishes. *See pictures*  - Note that the homemade beef noodle which we would usually assume its a noodle soup, wasn't. It was more of a saucy noodle with beef satay/bell peppers. Not what menu says and what we would have expect. So you have been informed. This noodle is a bit spicy too. Noodles were delicious (el dante) as advertised. While it was indeed homemade where the noodle maker was twirling them at the counter.  - The seaweed taste like it was straight from supermarket in the bucket with a bit of their own modifications. So a bit on fishier side. - The shredded potatoes had lots of spices and vinegar. More than what original recipe is like. So this may and may not be a good thing for customers. Depending if you're used to original flavors or much more flavorful. - shredded cucumbers were ok. Light and refreshing but could have given it a bit more flavoring. - The thin sliced beef in chili oil was good here! Best of all the dishes. Full of flavor indeed. I can't help but keep eating these regardless how i cant eat spicy food much. As it was that yummy.  Service:  They are busy. Therefore expect to be ignored ever so often. So obviously their service isn't the greatest and they don't talk much. Their just efficient. Gets your order, get your food and expect to be rushed out telling you, \"sorry, others are waiting for your seat\". Rude. So try coming when its not as busy if possible or expect rude service.  Cost: Cheap compared to the places I'm used to. Especially for handmade noodles! Won't mind coming back for the noodles but a different entree with those noodles of course."}
{"text":"Without having to go into a language lesson or a history lesson, I want to restate my \"Tip\".  Chinese ramen is NOT Japanese ramen.  They're both noodles, yes, but made in different ways.  They look different and taste different.  The regular hand pulled noodles were of a significant portion.  They were very even and had a nice texture/chew. There was no way I could finish my bowl.  The knife cut noodles were really good too.  However, I don't think you get the same portion of noodles as the hand pulled kind.  Keep in mind, it's a buck cheaper.    We tried the julienned potato as a side dish and it was alright.  For $1.99, it was still worth it.    I would definitely go back to try other menu items.  The servers were very pleasant too.  I don't have to trek all the way uptown for handmade noodles!  Yay!    I surprisingly enjoyed the Mandarin Chinese show on their big TV.  It was like an individual sport competition with judges/commentators.  I guess this made the experience more authentic?  Sure!"}
{"text":"Warm Winter - Cold Service  After walking around in an atypically warm winter, myself and my girlfriend decided to explore a new restaurant to celebrate the lunar new year.   Unfortunately, we chose this place.  The décor is fairly plain, but this was really no problem to me.  The waitress that first saw us distractedly motioned us to sit at one of the side booths.  After taking our coats and scarves off for a few minutes, the waitress came by with a couple of warm teas which was very nice.  I said \"thank you\", and she turned around and walked away without even so much as a glance in my direction.  She then brought us some utensils, napkins, and the order sheet.  I thanked her again, and her robotic face made no expression as she silently drifted back from our table.  I've experienced cold service like this before in Chinatown, so I wasn't really surprised.  I wasn't impressed either.  I immediately asked my girlfriend if she wanted to go somewhere else.  She said no, and that it would be fine here.    Unfortunately, there's something about rude service that puts me in a foul mood and therefore, I was not able to enjoy our dinner.  I was reasonably pleased with the taste, and speed at which our order came to us.  The broth seemed somewhat greasy, but flavourful.  If it came down to the quality if food, this place would get a half decent score, but the sour service ruined the experience. I did not tip and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I don't eat much ramen, but this place was fairly good. I had the beef ramen and I liked that it was not too salty like many of the Japanese ramen spots that I've been to. Also, it isn't very oily and the noodles seem to be of good quality. My main complaint would be the quantity of meat of which they give very little. If I crave noodles sometime in the future, I will definitely consider coming here again."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for a while now and I'm glad I finally got to try it out. It's my fav noodle place so far! I tried the hand pulled noodles with braised beef (7.99) and the lamb skewers (3.49). The broth is flavourful and light, the noodles are delicious and made in house. In fact you can watch them making/pulling the noodles right at the front of the restaurant. The lamb skewers weren't my fav, maybe the beef ones tastes better. Unsurprisingly, the place fills up pretty quickly. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Grab a flavourful meal for under $12 per person with tax and tip. You really can't go wrong. The broth is always flavourful and the noodles are fresh. The serving size is large - I can split one noodle soup with an appetizer with a gf or my mom and we're both satisfied. Big eaters will enjoy the value here. As it is a casual dining spot in Chinatown, please don't go in expecting white glove service. They're prompt (read: efficient) and that's about it - they won't be engaging with you in banter... much like every other place on Spadina."}
{"text":"It's  a very disappointed place! They do not accept credit card, or debit card without a chip. As a visitor from U.S, we don't have any cash either. So we have to pay US dollars. After we paid 50 US dollars for a 40 Canada dollars dinner, the waitress still ASK tips for the dinner. The service and the manner really bad, I never met this before in my entire life. DO NOT GO THERE!"}
{"text":"The quality of the meat is very inconsistent. Sometimes you'll get tonnes of fatty pieces with very little meat, other times you'll get plenty of pieces that taste amazing. At best it's a 5/5, and at it's worst a 3/5. Cross your fingers and hope you get a good day."}
{"text":"Delicious and freshly made noodles and huge serving.  Reasonable price.  Took one star out because of service."}
{"text":"Been a couple years since the last time I came. It's nice to see that the prices overall haven't really changed.  Ordered a hand-pulled noodle soup with braised beef, because I wanted to compare it with a similar bowl I had recently at another location. And the difference was huge.  Most of the meat was just the fatty pieces; there were probably only a couple small chunks of beef. They were tender, but they were also quite small so that is a factor to consider.  You get a decent amount of noodles. Actually most of the bowl consists of noodles. It's still got that chewy texture and some flavor, but I think it could have been a bit chewier.  The broth itself I found quite salty. I do remember that some of the bowls had a herbal flavor, but this to me was just way too salty. I did not find how the broth looked very appealing either, as you can see lots of oil floating around.  Service is good: we were offered plenty of tea refills (which was very diluted). But they've gotta step up their noodle soup game."}
{"text":"The Lanzhou Beef Noodles came at a great portion size for $7.99 and I was pleased with the hand-pulled noodles. Great authentic flavours were found in the cold steamed noodles. My favorite of the evening was the Fuqi feipian or \"sliced lung by the married couple\" (or as listed on the receipt, sliced beef and ox tongue) which was absolutely delicious with the homemade spice.  It's so good and affordable, I get why they say Toronto has great Chinese food now."}
{"text":"It's interesting to see how some Yelpers gave this place a low rating because they expected Japanese ramen and it's not.  Interesting because both the name ramen and the noodle itself were imports from China.  Japan did develop it own style, and its ramen now stands as a distinctive category, but to complain is like going to Italy and upset that the pizza doesn't taste like Pizzeria Uno.   Walking into the place I was pleasantly surprised by how clean and new it is.  The menu is rather extensive, with many things we want to try.  They have two types of noodles, the lamian  (pulled noodles) and knife noodle (shaved from a ball of dough.)  Personally I like the texture of the knife noodles more.    Can highly recommend: lamb stir fried lamian, the sliced beef in chili oil (lots of flavor, not too spicy), tofu skewers (much tastier than it sounds), lamb skewers, spicy cabbage, lotus root appetizer (a delightful blend of spicy and vinegary flavors), and sweet wine milk dessert.  This is one of the places in Toronto we keep returning to!"}
{"text":"My sister and I dropped by after seeing pretty good reviews on Yelp. I ordered the hand pulled noodles with beef brisket, one of the most popular recommendations on Yelp. The good came out pretty quickly and I was super excited to try it. The noodles are very, VERY CHEWY. Like if dukbukki had a cousin, these noodles would be him/her. The broth was A-OK but the beef was delicious and cooked perfectly.  You do see and hear Mr. Chef in the back slapping and pulling the noodles which reinforces the idea that yes, these noodles are fresh, hand pulled, and authentic. Service was good too.  I enjoyed my meal but it wasn't anything too special."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places we've ever eaten. It's small, doesn't look like much from the outside, but you can watch the guy make the noodles right in front of you.  The broth is flavorful, portions are large and for a great price.  We get the braised beef soup and it is delicious.  Service has always been fast and friendly.  The place is busy but we haven't had to wait for a table yet.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yum! I was very pleased with this place. Nice bright, clean setting.   For appetizers: got the jellyfish and sliced beef and ox tongue in chili oil  For noodles: tried both the hand pulled and sliced noodles with braised beef  Highlight of the night was hands down the sliced beef and ox tongue in chili oil. It was amazing. I couldn't stop eating it because the flavour, texture, everything was so on point. I filled my belly up on that, and ended up taking some of my noodles home instead.  The jellyfish dish was different from what I expected. It was thick cuts of jellyfish (I'm used to the strands), and came with sliced cucumber and raw onion. If you enjoy raw onion, I'd recommend this dish. I probably wouldn't order it again though cause the raw onion was so overpowering.  In terms of noodles - I think I prefer the hand-pulled noodles (in the soup at least). The sliced noodles had good texture too, but next time I think I'll try it in a stir fry dish instead of in soup.   Tip: I took the sliced noodles from my soup and started dipping it in the beef and ox tongue chili oil...so good. Maybe I'm just obsessed with that chili oil sauce."}
{"text":"My new favourite Asian place in Chinatown. Good prices. Great tastes. Big bowls of soup with vegetables and meat and the spinach vermicelli salad for $2.99 is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious food.  Ramen is as good as the reviews state.  The shallot pancake is a definite must-have.  Being able to see the pulling of the noodles only adds to the authenticity.  Great food!"}
{"text":"I usually love this place because their cold noodle dish is the best. Often times it's sold out because it's so popular. Giving this place a 2/5 star because today ...I bit into a small stone that was in my cold noodle dish. Like literally a stone/rock that you would find in dirt. I told the manager and she apologized and said she would take it off the bill. That by no means addresses the issue that this place should probably under go a dinesafe quality test...I hope they pass because it would be a shame if this place closed down. That would mean no more cold noodles for anyone.. :("}
{"text":"Ramen actually originated in China, but it is more famous as a Japanese dish. Chinese people have their own style of ramen and actually Koreans do too. So this restaurant is serving Chinese style ramen, not Japanese style. I personally like the Chinese style noodle slightly more than the Japanese counterpart. Chinese noodle shops tend to have more variety, and let you customize on toppings and thickness of noodles. And a lot of Chinese noodle shops make their noodles fresh and sometimes visible to its patrons.  This ramen shop is great as it's the only good one I know of downtown. The only other one I visit is Magic Noodle in Scarborough.   For $7.99, you get authentic noodles, in decent portion. In terms of value it's much better than the Japanese ramen shops. When you upsize in a Chinese place, I can see the difference. When I upsize in a Japanese ramen shop, I honestly can't tell if they added anything.   I guess part of the draw of the Japanese ramen shops is the service. Chinese places are notoriously bad with their service. This place is alright. Don't expect servers to energetically welcome you when you walk in. But do expect some good food, which is all that matters to me in a restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered Beef Offal ramen with soup and Shaved noodle with lamb over sauce. You cannot find noodle this chewy anywhere. The soup tastes good. The beef offal has tripes and tendon with a little bit  braised beef. The lamb is tender and the sauce is tasty. We will definitely come again next time I visit Toronto"}
{"text":"Homemade Ramen is located in Chinatown. You do not come here for decor or ambiance. The restaurant itself is nothing to look at, but the food is delicious and super affordable.   This place serves delicious hand-pulled lanzhou style noodles. A hot bowl of hand pulled noodle will set you back less than $10.  The portions are generous. The broth was flavourful and delicious. I got the thick noodles and it was cooked well. I really enjoyed the texture of the hand pulled noodles - al dente.  The service was quick and efficient. It is what you would expect at a place that needs to turn over tables quickly.   I would highly recommend it. I enjoyed this place more than Lan Zhou Ramen (a competitor to Homemade Ramen) on Dundas."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat around UofT! A little further south in Chinatown but definitely worth the walk. Their broth is always perfect and the portions fill me every time, especially for the price paid.  My favorite is their beef noodle. Will be coming back often :)"}
{"text":"The homemade ramen noodle were delicious and had a great texture! Soup was tasty,  i ordered the roasted beef soup and the beef pieces were full. Of flavor. You can also ask for an additional portion for 1$. The place is also really cheap 10$ with tips and taxes and Great portion. From outside i would have never guess how good it was, totally recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick dinner, and was very very pleased with the experience! The place was packed and bustling for a weekday night, but we still got our food at a decent time. I got the sweet and sour cut noodles on a recommendation from a server, and enjoyed it a lot. The portion was great for the price, and beyond filled me up. My friends got hand-pulled ramen orders, and finished about half of their bowls, simply because the portions were too big.   I also really liked their small side dishes! Their fuqi feipian was A+ and super cheap! We also had niurou dabing, or beef pancake, which was so good, and again so cheap, that I wanted to order another one to go had I not run out of cash.   Like many shops in Chinatown, the restaurant layout isn't anything to boast about, but the value you get for your money is great and I will definitely be dropping by again!"}
{"text":"This place is dirt cheap and is a safe haven for Chinese FOBs. That's when you know it's good. It's usually packed to the rim during the busy hours so expect to wait.  Both the sliced noodles and the stranded noodles are great. Pair it with an onion pancake and you've got a 10/10 meal right there."}
{"text":"The waitress was rude and didn't even try to elaborate anything when me and my friends asked about the menu. Besides this, the food was delicious , if you go out with friends you can order two dishes and it would be enough for 4-5 people (The spring rolls are expensive for the amount and the size of it, I don't recommend them)"}
{"text":"Great tasting handmade noodles and various dishes. Noodles have wonderful texture and soups are legit. I always get their pig ears and jelly fish. I've had their lamb noodle soup, stir fried lamb noodles, chicken and mushroom soup, beef noodle soup, and egg & tomato soup. All delicious. The fried meat pies were disappointing. Would definitely recommend this place as I usually visit twice a week. Good service for a Chinese spot!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday. I really like their hand pulled noodles. Cheap prices and filling. Flavors were great."}
{"text":"i read the reviews and decided I should check it out.  Based on the reviews I had the brisket instead of the beef.  I'm not sure if that was the best choice LOL as I got more bone and fat than meat.  What meat was there was tender but I mostly spooned up bones out of my bowl.    So the good:  the broth is nice & the noodles are good.     the deciding factor to go or not:  are you in the mood for noodles? like just noodles? otherwise you'll need more dishes as there wasn't enough meat to satisfy.   I sometimes am in the mood for oodles of noodles so to speak ...so I'd go then. :)"}
{"text":"A noodle place that is a favourite amongst UT students and a place my co-workers say I should frequent whenever I'm in the area. I finally made an effort to dine-in at Homemade Ramen and it did not disappoint.   Ordered the famous non-spicy sliced beef noodles. Portions are huge and the beef is delicious but definitely not as chewy as I imagined. You can easily share 2 bowls of noodles amongst 3 individuals because I barely finished my bowl. Soup is not bad but you can taste a little MSG in there. $10-11 all-in for a bowl of delicious handmade noodles is pretty fab.  Ever so often you will be able to hear the sound of the chef slamming the handmade noodles onto the table so don't be startled by the loud thuds!"}
{"text":"The Good: - Pretty inexpensive noodle shop - Noodles are on the softer side but tasty clearly fresh - The appetizers were pretty decent; we had pickled vegetables and the sesame beef sandwiches - The quality of the beef was pretty good - soft and tender - Service was decent and quick - Large amount of noodles  The Bad: - I thought the broth was a bit bland - however, reading other reviews, it could be that I am more used to different styles of broth that tend to be more savoury. - I got sick from the food :X  Overall, the food was OK.  If I ever go back, I'll have to try their other dishes.  As it stands, I do prefer other styles of beef noodle soup."}
{"text":"Tasty noodles. It seems like they are making the noodles all the time. You know cause you always here that crisp smack. So you know they are fresh. The apps are good here too. Don't know what they are called but one was a pancake roll I think. Different than \"regular\" Chinese food. Good prices. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday and loved it. I ordered the hand pulled noodles in soup with braised beef, the scallion pancake, and chicken wings. (Definitely a lot of food.)  The soup was served piping hot with cilantro on top plus green onion and a few pieces of carrot and white radish. The broth was flavourful and meaty but not overly thick. I've noticed people saying it was greasy - it was kind of oily, but I liked it.  The beef was a good portion and very tender. The noodles were fantastic - toothsome and nicely textured with great mouthfeel.  The scallion pancake and wings were too hot to eat when they got to the table. Both were pretty good renditions - flaky pancake, moist wings - but the soup was the star.  Would return with no hesitation."}
{"text":"I thought it was fantastic :) the noodles smell so good too, so chewy! Price is amazing for downtown, convinient location for students."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday. There's a good amount of seating in the restaurant and it was decently full on a Monday Night. There's relatively cheap parking walking distance by on Sullivan. We had prompt service. I opted for the braised beef noodle and the pancake. The pancake was okay. The noodles were tender and the broth was clean. There was a good amount of noodles. I opted to add the fried egg and thought it went well with the dish. I added some chilli oil for a kick and thought it was the perfect dish for a cold day. The beef was pretty tender and overall thought the meal was good value. Cheap and good!"}
{"text":"Very packed! Because it's good and fresh noodles. The noodles are very good, it's sooo filling. The only thing I didn't like about it is how bland the broth is. We ordered some side dishes as well, the fried dumplings, cold tofu with eggs and chicken wings. Chicken wings were very basic. You can get those anywhere. The dumplings were okay, I really like the sauce. The cold tofu was surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! The ramen was great, the vibe was upbeat, and the hot taro root with coconut milk was an unexpected treat."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese Ramen I had in quite awhile. My friends told me the snacks were very good but I went and only tried the homemade soup noodles. I have missed the days where they make the noodles in front of you and loved watching them doing it at the back while i waited for my lunch to be ready.  Overall the soup was really good, one of the first time I drank all the soup and second the homemade noodles were absolutely delicious. I can't wait to come back here for a second time!"}
{"text":"The best Lanzhou Ramen restaurant in downtown Toronto, noodles and ingredients are super fresh. Amazing price as well with most of the noodles priced at only $7.99.  Been to the restaurant twice, the sliced noodles with braised beef is my personal favourite.  Noodles: Both hand-pulled and sliced noodles are great, they have very different texture. The hand-pulled noodles have textures like Japanese ramen but a bit more chewy and less like egg noodles. The sliced noodles are thicker and chewy but not tough at all. The broth is fantastic pork bone based topped with cilantro and some vegetables like Shanghai Bok Choy and Chinese Radish.  Cold Dish: the sliced beef and ox tongue in chilli sauce (fuqi feipian) is fantastic. It is extremely flavourful and goes well with the noodles. This is a great to share especially between 2 people.  Overall, if you really like fresh noodles or you have never tried Lanzhou Ramen I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great noodle place. It must be Chinese style ramen because it was definitely different vs. Korean Ramyun or Japanese Ramen.  It tasted more close to Vietnamese Pho. Highly recommended!  Food: 4/5, scrumptious! We both got the hand pulled beef ramen.  The broth was delicious and the noodles were tasty. We also got the spring rolls which went well together.  Service: 3/5, nothing out of the ordinary   Ambience: 3/5, simple decor with chinese TV in the background.  Price: 4/5, about $10 per person"}
{"text":"oh... my... gawd..... like i have no words, you just have to come. first of all, it's not even ramen that's deceiving. they called it that due to the similarities to japanese ramen texture... i think? but seriously you get to watch the guy pull your noodle.. from batches of dough in front of your eyes. well he's in the back of the room but still. the freshness is unreal.  so i like the following, lamb screwers, the beef broth noodles, the spicy hot and sour noodles, and the pork rib noodles. yum yum!  I took my parent there, and they approve. and their bar(s) are high.   only downfall, no VISA, cash only.   Do it, try it, so freaking good."}
{"text":"First restaurant that I ate at in Toronto during interview season a few years ago. Went back recently and still very satisfied with the food and dissatisfied with the service. Really cheap (under $10 for a large portion size/big bowl of noodles with generous amount of toppings) tasty Chinese noodles with broth-y or dry options. Difficult to find true vegetarian options though and vegan options are basically nonexistent. The ingredients taste and look fresh - the veggies, meat, and especially the noodles, which have a chewy, handmade kind of texture that I really enjoy.   Food 4/5 - Generic, but fresh. Noodles are dough-y/chewy. Not a lot of good vegetarian options. Value 5/5 - Even compared to other Chinatown restaurants. Definitely way cheaper than Dundas options. Big portion sizes. Service 2/5 - Not friendly or attentive. A waitress spilled a glass of water on our table and threw us a few napkins to clean it up ourselves. Needless to say they work super fast paced here. Venue 3/5 - Small for the volume of customers (they are popular!), but enough tables to seat more than a few groups. I've never made a reservation for here and so far have always been seated almost immediately. However, definitely would recommend making a reservation if you plan on bringing a group of people since the place does frequently fill up at dinner time! Brightly lit. Loud. Washrooms are fairly clean and not dingy like some old school Chinatown washrooms.  They also do pickups."}
{"text":"This Lan Zhou ramen restaurant is one of the best noodle places downtown. I've been here 3 times with my boyfriend and the noodles hit the spot each time.   For appetizer, we always went with the traditional BBQ lamb skewers which tasted very similar to the ones you can find in northern China. The skewers are extremely tender with very flavourful seasoning. We also tried their spicy pork slices with minced garlic. The meat has a very soft texture with the right amount of medium spiciness combined with a sesame-infused garlic oil sauce over a layer of sliced cold cucumbers.   For noodles, we went with their most well-known dish - knife-cut sliced noodles with braised beef. The noodles are soft, chewy, and quite flavourful on their own - texture is quite unique and on point each time. However, what was disappointing about this dish is the soup and the braised beef. The soup is not always consistent, one time it was very bland and watered down. The beef was also not cooked well - some pieces were tough, too chewy or too fatty. But overall, the flavour of the noodle soup is very well balanced.   The service of the restaurant was pretty good. The waitresses were very informative and quick with our orders. Would definitely go back to try other noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen and wonderful, quick service. We tried the vegetable ramen and beef ramen. Both were delicious. Large portio."}
{"text":"I tried the Handmade Ramen with Beef and it both flavorful and tasty. The broth was delicious. The noodles are really phenomenal and chewy. The noodles have a really nice texture. You can see the chef make the fresh batch of hand pulled noodles at the back. For the price range, it is definitely worth trying for a mere $7.99 per bowl. Highly recommend it and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise, the food was very homey tasting as the name suggests! I ordered way too much as there was too much to try, but everything was very delicious.   In particular I would recommend the lamb skewers and the rice noodle appetizer. Their noodle soup is very savoury and I imagine would be great in colder weather!"}
{"text":"Having been to Lanzhou countless times to visit my grandparents, aunts and uncles, I must say that the lanzhou beef noodles that this place claims to have is no where near as good as the real thing. I have actually had much better lanzhou beef noodles in many cities in Canada.  However, we also got the garlic pork belly which my boyfriend could not stop raving about, it was so flagrant and their spicy oil that they added on top so delicious! The prices are student friendly and portions generous.   Overall, great for a simple dinner but if you're looking for the real deal, this isn't the place to look."}
{"text":"I've been obsessed lately with Lan Zhou pulled noodles.   On a very recent trip to Beijing, I've had numerous bowls from different \"highly ranked\" establishments and find Homemade Ramen the best (please note I have not yet been to Lan Zhou- I'm speaking only of Beijing).  That said, I find Homemade Ramen's broth very delicious, not overly salty. (I always go for 1102 so I am speaking for that particular dish). Sure, it may be MSG. I find the noodles to be on the softer side but the pickled radish that comes in the noodles really balance everything out. I always ask for extra cilantro and add black vinegar and chilli oil to my bowl, which the latter are available on every table. I usually accompany my noodles with a cold dish. They are usually delicious, packed with garlic and seasoning.   Also, try the cumin lamb skewers (???). It's a classic pair. Lan Zhou has the highest population of Muslims in China and they consume a lot of lamb.   I would avoid getting the knife cut noodles ??(???). That is a specialty of another region (ShanXi) and I don't particularly think they execute it well."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the price is right the location is great the food is hot the service is amazing they have a variety of meats and options and the flavor of the ramen noodle taste like butter and you can tell that is homemade."}
{"text":"Second time here and equally delicious! Hand pulled noodles are one of my favourites. The ones here are nice and chewy with a light and flavourful broth perfect for a chilly evening. We came on a Friday evening so this time we didn't have a long wait. Staff here are super friendly and they have some English speaking staff which will be helpful for those of you who can't speak Chinese.   I can't remember exactly what we ordered but I included photos for your reference. Everything was really good if you're craving some northern Chinese flavours. I'm not super big on the numbing spice but this place adds just enough to the sliced beef dish that leaves you craving more. If you're looking to try more than a bowl of noodles just order one, it's enough for two people! We had a bowl of noodles, sliced beef pancake sandwich (see photo bc I can't remember what it's really called), and the spicy beef. We left fully satisfied and stuffed.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was good but nothing so special about it. I ordered hand-pulled soup noodles. Quick service and convenient location. It's pretty cheap too. So if you are in the area, I recommend this place for a quick bite. Note that this place is not that special compared to other noodle places in China Town."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING AND EVERYONE SHOULD GO AND I WISH I WENT BACK AND ORDERED SO MUCH MORE FOOD.  If I could give this place 10 stars I would.  It makes my other 5 star reviews feel ever so slightly undeserved.  First note, this is not Japanese ramen.  It's Chinese hand-pulled noodles (pronounced la-mian) from Lanzhou, a city famous for these particular noodles.  On the menu are also other dishes hailing from Xinjiang province (known for its Muslim community), like lamb skewers, rou jia mo (meat in between two toasted slices of a bun), and sesame pancakes with beef.  The cumin, the meat, and the different pancakes and noodles are just...I can't do the food justice with words.  I have not had food this delicious and satisfying since visiting China.  Ambience & Service: Clean and simple, it looks more hole in the wall from the outside, but the inside was nicer.  The best part?  Behind the front desk, we could see a chef pulling and splitting the noodles as we ate.  There's nothing quite like a dinner performance to convince you on the freshness and authenticity of what you're eating.  As for service, it was blunt and efficient.  The restaurant was full, but we waited 5 minutes for a table.  To order, we were given a small slip of paper and instructed to write the menu numbers on them.  I loved it.  It was just so efficient.  I also like to imagine that this is the chef's way of saying, \"nothing else here matters except for what you're about to eat\".  Of course, it was probably just because they were busy and wanted to turn over the tables.  Food: Everything we tried was great, so this is functionally just a list of everything we tried. -Sliced noodles with braised beef: Imagine a chef slicing off strands from the edges of a large slab of dough into a bowl with a consistent and dangerous precision.  Personally, I find the sliced noodles a lot better than the hand pulled.  It was denser and, because it was sliced, the thickness within a strand of noodle varies.  In the middle, the thickest part, it was denser, doughier, chewier and tasted more purely of the noodle.  To the sides, it was thinner, and therefore mushier, lighter, and had picked up more of the broth.  Eating one strand at a time meant tasting how the noodle and broth complimented each other; eating a spoonful of noodles meant feeling how satisfying it is to snap through the noodles and to let that simple aroma flood your mouth.  The beef was also soft - to be honest, I really only paid attention to the noodles. -Golden Needle Mushrooms: my favorite appetizer.  These mushrooms were always a favorite of mine (try them in hotpot, or wrap them in aluminum foil with some butter and roast them), but this place did well to highlight its natural sweetness.  It was also made with bell peppers, which was a great idea.  Both bell peppers and these mushrooms have subtle flavors, but since bell peppers are commonly used to lend more flavor to a dish and the mushrooms were so much lighter, the mushrooms here picked up the flavor of the bell peppers extremely well.  The chef also did well to not overcook the mushrooms as they still had snap when chewed.  We should have ordered another one. -Jellyfish salad: the jellyfish was crunchy and not slimy, a sign that it is fresh and well prepared.  The sauce was also slightly garlicky; it was very light and tasty, a great appetizer. -Hand-pulled noodles with beef: Perhaps we should have tried a different broth that was a bit more flavorful, but the noodles were just a bit too bland.  Something spicy would have been nice as the noodles would act as breaks in between sips of broth.  Texture-wise, the noodles were chewy.    Recommendations:  Bring a group of friends or a foodie friend and order everything on the menu.  Next time, I would love to try the sesame pancake with beef, the lamb skewers, and the liang pi (cold noodles - they were out this time)."}
{"text":"I grew up in Markham where there's Chinese food everywhere, so there hasn't been a lot of places that stood out in Chinatown. The only exception is the hand pulled ramen w/ sliced beef from Homemade Ramen.   As mentioned in previous reviews, the handmade noodles were fresh and suitably chewy; I quite enjoyed it w/ the light broth, which was flavored w/ cilantro, daikon, and scallions. There were lots of it as well, unlike the sliced beef, but you can pay more to add extra meat.   Overall, it's a great bowl of noodles that's cheap & filling. And it's better than the Lan Zhou Ramen down the street."}
{"text":"This place is great hole in the wall. Got the braised beef ramen with homemade noodles $7.99. Awesome broth. Comes with beef, noodles, green onions, and cilantro. Was fantastic. Would give 5 stars but it was a bit too fatty for my liking. Beyond that, awesome. You get tea as soon as you sit down and the service is quick and attentive. You can also see the chef making the homemade noodles while u eat which is fun. Would definitely recommend for a cold wet night if ur in the mood."}
{"text":"We decided to check out this restaurant out due to a recommendation from a friend and also because we were intrigued by a \"ramen\" shop in Chinatown. The restaurant was very clean and nicely decorated. We stopped by in the middle of the afternoon and was seated right away, but it got busier around 5:00PM.  The boyfriend ordered the Hand-pulled Ramen with Beef and I chose the Hand-pulled Ramen with Lamb. My order came as a fried noodle dish, which wasn't clear from the name on the menu, but it turned out delicious, so I didn't mind. The portion was very generous for the price, and had lots of lamb and veggies in it. Service was also very fast.  I felt like the broth in the soup-based Ramen with Beef was a bit bland, but the boyfriend really enjoyed it and thought it brought out the flavour of the noodles better. The fried noodles were generously coated in sauce, so if you tend to enjoy saltier foods, then I would recommend you try the fried noodles first. The star of the dishes, the hand-pulled noodles, were great: chewy and perfectly cooked. You can also watch the chef in action, which is fun.  We will definitely come back again and try some of the other items on the menu. If you're in the area, Homemade Ramen is a great place for quick, hearty comfort food."}
{"text":"We passed by this place numerous times but thinking that it was another ramen restaurant didn't think about even going inside.  I went to my trusted 'Yelp' app and found that it has good reviews. So I figure to give it a try and I'm so glad I did!  It's a fairly decent sized place and service is fast and friendly.  If you're going to order one thing on their menu, you have to try their Spinach and Vermicelli Salad.  Even if you're non-vegetarian you will surely enjoy this. It comes with stir fried Chinese spinach, glass noodles and roasted cashews which is so good.  We also ordered their famous Hand Pulled Ramen with Braised Beef. We really love how the noodles were soft and chewy and how flavourful the broth is. The addition of radish, scallions, cilantro and beef brisket to the fresh noodles makes this an outstanding soup, perfect for cold days! For $8.50 the portion is just right for the price you paid.  We will surely come back here to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Homemade Ramen has a white floor, color changing walls, and a white ceiling with random red glowing ribbons. Tables are pretty close together, each set with whatever amount of chopsticks; haven't seen forks, so you should probably learn how to use chopsticks...... Thank goodness I did!Decor is minimal unless you count all the Chinese writing on the walls (by the looks of it, it looks like the restaurant's history). A few drawings accompany the writing. In the back, a chef hand pulls the noodles, surrounded by those twisty bamboo plants. Even from a distance, the noodle pulling looks cool!   The drink choices are mostly the usual sodas, and Jia Duo Bao, a drink that may look unfamiliar, but after some research, I found it is a sort of sweet, carbonated iced tea that comes in a can. Unfortunately, there weren't any alcoholic drinks that I could see.   Dinner starts out with the menu, with lots of different choices, hand pulled noodles, sliced noodles, appetizers, etc. LOTS of appetizers.   Service is relatively fast. The ambience is casual with a mostly low noise level. There is one TV in the back of the room, showing Chinese talent shows and the like. It's a little chilly; I'd recommend bringing a light jacket just in case.  The appetizers are delicious with wide variety. The lotus root is nice and crunchy, with a garlicky and oily taste. Bok choy is kinda tasteless, but I'm not a fan of it to begin with anyway! The scallion pancakes are buttery and not too heavy, and the taro root is mildly sweet and has a pureed texture.  The entree comes, and it is fabulous! The hand pulled noodles are smooth, soft and chewy, the beef is flavorful but not too fatty, and the broth is a light harmony of oil, garlic, and beef, sprinkled with slices of green onions and  parsley. Very tasty, yet not too filling.  I didn't get a chance to eat dessert  but at a glance the choices look pretty optimal.  Dinner is finished off with a not-too-shabby $50 (Canadian money, roughly $35 dollars in the United States) check, and wrapped guava candy (just an FYI, three other people were eating with me. The $50 dollars is not just for what I ordered).  Definitely coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"You can tell that this restaurant tries pretty hard with the presentation to look legit, what with the pretty light-up sign on the storefront and the new and pleasant ambiance inside that didn't feel like Chinatown at all. They seem to take pride in serving Lanzhou ramen at its finest, and if you can read it they even have a history of these noodles on the menu for you. The size of the bowl that you get for the price makes it quite worth it if you're hungry.  I thought the noodles were very good. The beef was very tender and there was lots of it. The daikon, cilantro, and scallion were fresh, and the broth was flavorful but not too dense. Their noodles could have been a bit softer (probably a bit more cooking time), and the broth did not come with any chili oil on top as I believe it's traditionally done--you read the menu and they describe the bowl as coming with five colors: clear broth, white daikon, red chili, green cilantro/scallion, and yellow noodles. I guess I could've added that middle one myself, but the presentation would've been off."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I came across this restaurant when walking down the streets of Chinatown. I've been looking for a good beef noodle place ever since moving here a few years ago. Their beef noodle soup is one of the best in the city (and the price is definitely budget friendly)! I will definitely be stopping by for a quick meal whenever I pass by Chinatown."}
{"text":"Their Handmade Ramen with Beef (#1101), made with beef bone broth and topped with cilantro, braised beef, and a whole assortment of Chinese toppings is both flavorful and tasty, without the overbearing artificial saltiness you get from MSG--its the real deal here. The noodles have a very al dente and chewy consistency, are freshly made, and balance out in taste with the broth. If you've ever wondered what Chinese comfort fast-food tastes like, this is the place to go.   Another great part of Homemade Ramen is the price. If you are like many of us, broke-college students, this place offers very affordable prices with the majority of their main dishes at around $8.00! It is definitely hard to find a place that is both cheap and tasty, but Homemade Ramen definitely encapsulates both. Try this place out and indulge your tastebuds with legit Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This is the 1st Chinese restaurant I stopped by in Toronto . The food was delicious and service was great. Hand pulled noodles were delicious! They hand you a pad and you write down the order number you want. Remember, debit or cash only no credit cards.  The menu is pretty big with many choices to choose from. In the end we ordered the sliced pork belly with garlic sauce, beef noodle soup and chicken stir fry noodles and scallion pancake. All the noodles were all hand pulled.  The pork belly was soft, tender and the garlic was not overpowering and was balanced nicely with the sweet and salty. The noodle soup and stir fry were delicious and we enjoyed every chewy bite. The scallion pancakes were very light and not too oily and they were tasty good.   A great hand pulled noodle restaurant that you can't go wrong with. I will be back whenever I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this isn't another new Japanese ramen place. They do Chinese ramen, fantastic Chinese ramen at that.  The difference is more than pedantic. Instead of a soy sauce based broth or a rich broth, Chinese ramen is served with a light bone broth with a completely different flavour profile. The noodles are probably the biggest differentiating point. Instead of yellow alkali noodles, which are delicious in their own right, Chinese ramen noodles, or hand-pulled noodles, are made by twisting and pulling a piece of dough and then folding the result in half and then repeating the process multiple times, hence the name. You can find videos of it on YouTube. It's actually quite incredible. The ramen is topped with braised beef and vegetables and garnished with scallions and cilantro. There's quite a strong cilantro note in the dish. Cilantro-haters beware.  You can see (and hear) the chef actually making the noodles at the back of the restaurant, which can be cool or slightly distracting. Despite the display, the noodles aren't perfect. The texture is all right, but they're generally much thinner than what they serve at Homemade Ramen. The broth, however, tastes pretty authentic. Can't really complain about the braised beef, but they're nothing special. It's not what you might be served in China, but it's pretty damn close."}
{"text":"Often the best hole-in-the-wall eateries have the most senseless names. I mean, who has time to knock out creatively chic names when you're so busy elevating lives with your food? Well, this is a fine example of that (at least when it comes to the naming). NO, this is not the all to familiar Japanese ramen. This is Chinese noodles at it's finest; a work of art centuries in the making -- this is LAMIAN (pronounced \"lie-men\" - pulled noodles).  There's been a hand-pulled/chopped noodles movement as of late. With the very first stint(it's still there) situated in the infamous Pacific Mall, we have seen a sudden surge of such eateries all over the city. With Magic Noodles championing this movement in the north(and Scarb-area), we are seeing a better representation of this art by the day! Albeit the aforementioned is somewhat lackluster in my books.  I must say these guys have surpassed my expectations a great deal. The broth is clear, flavourful and low on the grease scale. The soups are  low in sodium for Chinese standards but somehow still able to provide distinct flavours with subtle complexity. The meats in the soups are equally impressive; tender, juicy and delicious! Of course the star of the bowl is the noodles which taste distinctively handmade. Silk smooth texture all the while still maintaining that slight chew to them - absolute perfection! Even the sides are admirable.  Balance, delicate, delicious, fast and affordable -- I honestly cannot find any faults, all I have are praises for this place. Definitely one of the most balanced bowl of lamian in the city."}
{"text":"Homemade Ramen is one of my go-to places in Chinatown for a huge, delicious, and cheap meal. Their Braised Beef Sliced Noodles are amazing and you can see the chef making the noodles as you eat. I also tried the Dan Dan noodles which gave me enough leftovers for another meal (though not as saucy as I prefer). Their meat dishes are authentic and flavourful as well.   For a $8 bowl of noodles, definitely keep this place on your radar (but make sure to bring cash/debit)!"}
{"text":"Very impressed. Freshly pulled ramen, i preferred the thicker cut noodle that they call \"knife-cut\" in soup noodle. Good soup base too. Durian purple rice dessert was not that great though."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's so bomb!!! I think I said yum x10 while eating lol. My bf and I drive from Detroit just for this place!! The noodles are perfectly hand stretched which give it a nice chewy texture. Our favorites are the stir fried noodle with beef and Chinese ramen. We've had the stir fried noodles with both thin and wide noodles. We preferred the wide. I tried both the beef brisket and chicken with mushroom with thin noodles. I preferred the chicken with mushroom ramen! Their skewers are good too, definitely go for the noodles. Service is good and the staff there are really nice as well."}
{"text":"Wow I was so impressed with this place. The noodles tastes amazing and I was so full from the generous portions. Prices were reasonable at around 9 bux per bowl. The broth was concentrated but my one pepper spicey was pretty tame. Service is your typical Chinese restaurant so don't expect too much. All in All I'm pretty impressed and would definitely go back to try out other flavours and snacks"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a few years but wanted to check it out again. It's always packed and when a restaurant has survived over a year, there is typically something going for it.  The ramen (hand pulled or sliced) is reasonably priced at $8.50-10. Big portions. I recommend the hand pulled. I always find the sliced/thicker noodles is too much dough in each bite. The broth is nothing to write home about, perhaps lacking in some complexity, however, it will likely satisfy most people. I find the broth at Lanzhou ramen on Dundas is a bit better.  Also, got the pork slices in chilli sauce and that was very good as well. Was compiled with peanuts, other spices, overall a good option. Would try the pig ears next.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  You can watch the chef make your noodles fresh to order.  He twirls them in the air over and over again until they turn into individual noodles.  Reminded me of Kung-fu panda's father making them.  My favorite was braised beef.  Get it a little spicier if you like a little heat."}
{"text":"I'm back on Yelp!  This place is right in the heart of chinatown and I was a bit skeptical to go here at first because I have really high standards for noodle houses. I have been to a lot of noodle houses in the richmond hill, markham, thornhill area. Also, where my family is from, we eat a lot of noodles to begin with already. So, for me to rate a noodle place 4/5 stars, it's really good!   When it said \"hand-pulled ramen\" I was questioning whether or not it was really hand pulled and also why they wrote \"ramen\" instead of just \"noodles\".  This was my first time here. I ordered the preserved duck eggs with peppers (cold dish) and also the braised beef with hand pulled ramen.   The preserved duck eggs (or thousand year old eggs) is definitely an acquired taste. I'm pretty sure on YouTube some people eat this egg as a \"dare\", implying it's some crazy feat that people do and is like a punishment. But for me, I love it. It has a bit of a strong fermented after-taste, the yolk is green (it's supposed to be green) and the white of the egg is black (it's supposed to be black). It was really nicely seasoned for me (although I do have a strong palette). Besides being salty, and eggy, and having a bit of a \"stank\", there's no other complex flavour. You can add some spice to it if you want but I definitely think this is an acquired taste. I didn't eat the peppers though (they were bell peppers) because the skin on the peppers looked not very fresh/clean. But, that's besides the point! The egg itself is good.   The noodles were really good. Perfectly cooked, not too soft, not too chewy, just perfect. The broth was equally as good, very flavourful and full of body and meatiness and heartiness. The beef itself was very very tender and just looking at it wrong will Make it fall apart.   It's a typical hustling Chinese noodle house. It's not formal, but that doesn't mean the people there are rude (they were very nice). Everything is fast paced, people go in and out all the time. It's not quiet, it's not super noisy, it's like any other typical average chinatown restaurant you would find. It doesn't feel awkward going by yourself either since that's what I did today!  Oh and lastly... For what you are paying, it is totally worth it! The egg appetizer and the noodles costed me a total of around 12 bucks after tax. It's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"MUST TRY: Ox Tongue appetizer  My goal: Eat all the La Mian pulled noodles in sight.  I walked in and I saw the noodle master who pulls all the noodles, in plain view of the whole restaurant! Instant fail.  #1613 \"Sliced beef and Ox Tongue in chili sauce\" overshadowed the rest of the meal. The slices of meat are thin to maximize flavour and you can dip each slice in as much oil and chili as you want.   In retrospect, this appetizer should be eaten AFTER the main noodle dishes. They seemed a bit boring because of the difficult contrast.  I enjoyed the noodles. The popular #1102 \"hand pulled ramen with braised beef \" is a noodle soup that is most similar to pho in principle. It's good, the broth is clean and tasty. Simple. [note: I detected zero spice, despite the chili next to it on the menu]  I preferred the #1109 \"Sauteed noodle with minced meat\". This is not minced meat as we are used to thinking about it. The chunks of meat are thicker, so it's like little shards of barbequed meat.  When I return, I'll probably order 3 x Slice Beef and Ox Tongues, or maybe they can create some sort of frankenstein bowl of ox tongue chili sauce and noodles.  BONUS: Mentioned already, but you need to see this man who pulls the noodles. If you haven't heard, THE ROBOTS ARE COMING and they have scary eyes:"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for noodles downtown. They come in a variety of sizes, types, meat and veggie pairings and spice levels so you will be sure to find something that suits your mood. The noodles are made fresh by a guy throwing the dough around in the back (it's noisy, so expect lots of banging noises).   I had the hand pulled noodles in broth with beef and pickled veggies. The broth came out hot and steaming (I hate lukewarm soup),and the noodles were suitably chewy. It was a simple meal with all the right components, nothing fancy or too inventive. Would recommend if craving some good noodles."}
{"text":"I am giving a 4 for food not the service which was not very good at all .  We ordered the ramen with beef and pickled vegetable. The noodles were great we watched them being made I added a little chile spice which made it perfect. We had vegetable ramen and ordered steaming taro root with coconut which was very good .  Tip they said cash or debit card only but ran my debit as a credit because I did not have to enter my pin so questionable of this"}
{"text":"Okay, the food is great. It's on par with authentic Chinese noodles and I have been here pretty occasionally lately. Their noodles are okay, lamb chops are very average feels like they aren't really fresh. Their lamb sandwich is pretty good tho.   Unfortunately, their servants are mostly retarded. The whole point of having people write their items on your piece of paper is for YOU to take it. It seems the staffs (except the head) fail to understand this concept, which can get very frustrated for their customers.   If you are the owners and you are seeing this. Please train your staffs appropriately, if they don't want to be here, fire them."}
{"text":"the restaurant name is a bit misleading - note this is NOT ramen (typically a japan dish unless you are referring to the packaged variety that college students live off of), but is actually a chinese noodle shop! good thing the yelp search function works properly, because when i searched for chinese noodles, this was one of the top hits that came up near where we were staying.  absolutely delicious beef noodle soup and really hit the spot to satisfy our chinese noodle cravings. choose the type of noodle you want - either hand pulled or knife cut. i tried both and thought they were great. normally i'm a knife cut noodles type of person, but on that particular day i was craving hand pulled and it definitely delivered.  the only reason they don't get 5 stars is because of the service - we arrived to a full house but were first in line for the next open table. Given that there's nowhere near the entrance to wait around, we waited inside near the front of the restaurant where the cash register was, but made sure that several waitresses knew we were there and waiting for a table. 10 minutes later, another group of people walked in and were seated at a table near the entrance that happened to be leaving just as they arrived. UM HELLO, WE WERE HERE FIRST! you best believe i put on my most annoyed voice and made sure that the head waitress knew that we had just been snubbed. NOT COOL.  they did seat us at the next available table that freed up, but boy did that leave a not-so-great first impression.  i see some recent reviews mention that this is cash only, but we were able to pay with credit card just fine. no minimum limit as far as we could tell."}
{"text":"We always come here when we're craving noodle soup. The sides are definitely the best part. They are so cheap and well portioned. Our go to sides are rolled onion pancake with beef (amazing but oily), fried squid tentacles (okay but cheap to fulfill the craving), and sliced beef in chili sauce (we ask for no ox tongue - great flavor). We've tried their beef and chicken skewers but I'm not a fan of cumin which this is drenched in.   In terms of mains, we order sliced noodle in braised beef and ramen noodle in sliced beef. Both are good since the broth is light and clean. The beef is soft."}
{"text":"My go to spot in Chinatown! Absolutely love their broth and noodles! Great service too :)"}
{"text":"I actually love love love this place!  They hand-pull their noodles in plain view, and offer a huge menu of side dishes which are SUPER AFFORDABLE!   The noddle is hot and savory, and everything is just so comforting, delicious and affordable that I really can spoil myself here.  Some of my favorites side dishes are: - BBQ king oyster mushroom.  - spinach and vermicelli salad (comes with toasted cashews, which are insanely good), - shredded potatos  - shredded cucumber - lotus in chili oil - green onion pancake with beef wrap"}
{"text":"The noodles are decently pulled but the broth was rather uninteresting. Good selection of side dishes though (and decent sizes for the price). Service is good as far as Chinese restaurants are concerned. Not too busy on a weekday evening."}
{"text":"Came here after a recommendation. I've always walked by it, but was never interested in it.  Years ago, it used to be a seafood restaurant that my family and I frequented. Following a shooting, it shut down and was taken over by an OK ayce sushi place, and business always appeared slow. Since then, I haven't seen such a busy restaurant on a weekday as last night. We were seated close to the staircase that leads to the bathroom, but later moved closer to the window/entrance because there was a a slight stench of bathroom, kinda reminiscent of a restaurant that cooks stinky tofu.   Between the three of us, we ordered: ramen with beef, stir fried cut noodle with lamb, lamb skewers (2), squid skewer (1), sliced beef in pancake, and a lotus root salad. Service was quick. The ramen soup broth was delicious, beef was tender and flaked off in your mouth. However, I wished there was more veggies, like Bok choy or something. I'm not a fan of lamb, but the lamb was very good! My only complaint about the skewers is that sometimes when you bit into it, it was like eating a layer of spice. The skewers were smothered in spices, and it wasn't consistently smothered. The sliced beef in pancake was my favourite! The lotus rood salad was also good, but garlicy.   Overall, it was a very good experience and very affordable. However, you may end up with garlic breath for the rest of your night. Enough to legit ward off dozens of vampires.   Bonus - You know how in the news, clowns have been terrorizing cities across the world. After we paid, the tip was left on the tray on the table. We continued talking until we felt someone breathing on our shoulder and said \"excuse me\". We screamed, and there was a female peddler with makeup applied improperly all over the face. The restaurant stated that it was the first time it had happened. I guess we were the lucky ones."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype for this place. The noodles aren't particularly great. The soup is okay as well. It's not highly memorably good. Service is OK but not outstanding as well.   I blame people who took me here, they hyped it up too much. :)"}
{"text":"Always come here to get my braised beef noodle soup fix. The portions are very generous for the price and the cold plates here are great value.   The noodles are made in-house at the back of the restaurant and you can see/hear the chef making them. The hand pulled noodles were very chewy in texture and not too thick. I found the soup to be a little bit too salty/oily but definitely still manageable. The menu has great variety and we ordered a lot of vegetarian side dishes/snacks which were great and super affordable (~$2-$5)."}
{"text":"Wished this place opened earlier when I was still in university ! My gf and I both ordered individual ramens - one being the thick noodle and the other one was a Szechuan braised beef (it was not spicy at all) but the chili oil obviously helps.   Overall we were pretty blown away by the quality, I really enjoyed the soups and smooth the texture of the noodles. Definitely worth a try! We felt that the quanity for the thick noodle to be lacking but for some reason they gave us a lot of noodle for the other Szechuan noodle dish.   The chicken skewers were delicious but a bit heavy on the flavour, even for my taste but it was a great compliment with the noodles.   Would definitely come back again if I'm in the area to try the other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Homemade Ramen is the downtown answer to the Magic Noodle brand in Scarborough and Richmond Hill. If you are unwilling to make the trek for some awesome Shanghai noodles, this place in Chinatown actually does an admirable job in its noodles as well.  I kept it simple during my lunch break and ordered #102, which was the hand-pulled noodle with braised beef. If you can't take spice you can order #101 instead, but as someone who isn't tolerant of spice it really isn't that spicy! Heed of warning though, if you don't like green onions, write it down because they will put a lot of onions in the noodle soup.  The speed of this place is quite good, as I got my food within 4-5 minutes. The noodles have a very good texture that's comparable to Magic Noodle, but what really stood out was the beef broth, which I found to be better than Magic Noodle as it had a nice flavour to it. I wonder if the better flavour was a result of the abundance of green onions in my broth though.  Price-wise, this place is slightly higher ($7.99) than your typical noodle joint in Chinatown, but the quality definitely makes up for it.  Service was quick and efficient, and for these places that's all that matters. I will certainly recommend this place to my friends and will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place automatically gets a decent review for doing North-West Chinese food. It's a part of Chinese cuisine that gets very little love in the West.   The liang pi I had was a bit bland. I thought it needed more vinegar and salt. The scallion pancake was great (though I didn't expect it to be deep fried). And although fu qi fie pian isn't strictly North Western Chinese food, they pulled it off really well. Would get it again.   Overall, if you are not familiar with this part of Chinese cuisine, Homemade Ramen is a good place to start."}
{"text":"I only did takeout since the place was pretty packed. Let's just say this pace exceeded my expectations and gave me a pleasant surprise. The noodles were hand made so skillfully because every strand was nearly equally thick and to perfection. They also packed the soup base in a plastic container so its reusable and prevents from spilling. And portions were extremely generous for a good price. Definitely going to order or eat in often while in the area.   What I ordered: Hand pulled ramen with braised beef $7.99 Hand pulled ramen with tomato and egg $7.99"}
{"text":"Fantastic Chinese hand pulled noodle joint right in the heart of Chinatown. Standard casual and cheap Chinese restaurant with adequate service and seating. Solid menu with a selection of hand pulled noodles, sliced noodles, fried noodles and a bunch of great sides. Noodle serving is generous, at a very reasonable price.   Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at it's best!!! We had the braised beef soup, sour pork spicy noodle, squid tentacles, fried wings, and gizzard skewers. Both my boyfriend and I got the worst food poisoning ever!!!! Also, once you start walking down the stairs towards the washroom you get hit by this horrendous smell of sewage and decay like they're keeping dead bodies in there. Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Tip:  If you're ordering beef noodles, do the brisket as opposed to the \"sliced beef\".  Brisket is more tender as opposed to the sliced beef which was a bit chewy.  Taste is ok.  Portions are large.  Was stuffing myself in order to finish the bowl as I did not want to carry a soupy takeaway on the TTC.  The broth for the sliced beef was quite oily.  (I spotted other diners with oily lips.)  Quite simple, average, nothing mind blowing.  Conveniently located near the intersection of Spad/Dundas.    The average for a bowl of noodles was ~$8, plus taxes/tips.  I did see a man at the back of the restaurant whipping some dough around.  I did find it a bit difficult to communicate with the waitresses in English.  Had to repeat myself a couple of times."}
{"text":"One of the best Lan Zhou noodles I've tried in the GTA! In my opinion it's more authentic than magic noodles uptown. I had their traditional beef noodle ($7.99), seaweed salad ($2.99) and ??? ($9.99) (sorry forgot English name! It was the first one on the hot food section.) I ordered lamb and it was delicious! Very tender and flavourful of cumin. The seaweed salad was so refreshing! Just the perfect amount of salt and bit of vinegar to make me want to keep eating it. The only thing is that I wish they had a bigger portion I would pay up to $5 for that seaweed appetizer in a bigger plate. Le bf got braised beef sliced noodles which he really liked as well.   Overall, I spend $14 after tax and tips (half of our bill since we went dutch lol) I thought the meal was really worth it since we took the lamb dish leftovers to go too.   Service was fast and friendly. Definitely will come here more often!"}
{"text":"Enter this place in the heart of all the shops along China town and you are at peace. I went in for dinner on a Sunday afternoon and it was so quite in here yet all the seats were occupied. The waitresses seem professional but not that friendly. The best thing here besides the food was seeing the head chef make ramen. He had these large pieces of dough and was doing his dance of designing it and kneeding it. The food came out very quickly after the order. Large portions are on par with the price. I even had another dinner for the next day. The sweet and sour chicken was hot coming out. What I enjoyed the most about the plate was that it had a lot of chicken. Crispy peppers and lots of pineapples drenched in sweet and sour sauce."}
{"text":"Fave Asian noodle place in downtown Toronto :):) A lot of side dishes and other options in addition to soup noodle"}
{"text":"Meh. Maybe my expectations were too high because of good reviews, but I was disappointed. Ordered the hand-pulled noodles with beef brisket. They were pretty good, but nothing special. Same with the green onion pancakes. The real problem was the service. I don't mind that most of the servers don't speak much English, but they should try to learn the table numbers. There was a lot of confusion with my order and those of tables near to me, as the servers kept bringing dishes to the wrong tables or just wandered around the room in a daze. I would like to have asked to add Bok choy to my soup, but I realized that would probably cause way too much confusion. I much prefer Chinese Traditional Bun around the corner on Dundas, which has a similar menu."}
{"text":"We arrived Sunday around 6:30pm and half the tables were empty. Within 15 minutes the place was packed. We were the only English speaking, Caucasians in the place. Always a good sign regardless of the restaurant: if the locals pack the place then it must be good.   We ordered chicken skewers, mutton skewers, cured pork in buns, and handmade pulled ramen with braised beef. All were excellent.   The biggest surprise was the beef soup. I was actually expecting a platter of noodles with beef. After my first sip of the rich and beefy broth, I was happy I ordered incorrectly.   I noticed as we walked out that at least half of the tables had the same items that we did. Once again, Yelp didn't steer us wrong."}
{"text":"4/5 stars for the appetizer for beef and sliced ox tail in chilli Sauce. Amazing!   3/5 stars for #1109 ramen noodles (Chinese) with minced meat. Didn't have much flavour."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Do not mistaken this for japanese ramen - this is better. A fair price,  fast friendly service, clean, tasty without overly salty, plus the guy in the back is hand making these fresh noodles - so really its like a dinner and a show."}
{"text":"Terrific hand pulled noodles. You can see it done right across the counter. Excellent service. Simple setting, as expected.   Love how many options they give for size of noodles. Meat options are strong as well, including both the more conventional and the offal."}
{"text":"Super traditional and clean Chinese noodle place, def recommend it. ???????????????????????"}
{"text":"The food was okay. Not so much the two hairs I later found in my takeout container.  Ew. Ew. Gross."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review 4 hours after I consumed the ramen and I'm dying of thirst.  No wonder it tasted so damn good while I was eating it...MSG!   I ordered the braised beef noodle soup, the broth was tasty and the beef was very savoury.  I practically drank half of the the soup in my bowl.  My husband ordered the hand slice noodles we didn't like that as much. It was too doughy for our liking. As for the cold plates, we ordered the lotus slices and the shredded cucumber salads, both were tasty but was drenched with oil and crushed garlic.  We also ordered the fried squid tentacles, although it was crunchy, it was lacking some spices.   Despite the use of MSG and excessive oil, the food was very tasty, the price is good, and service was very efficient so I would go back once a month."}
{"text":"Great Raman noodle restaurant. My first time having Raman noodles, and they were freshly made! Very courteous staff, offered jasmine tea as soon as you sat down. They have a variety food selection from their menu, similar to many typically Pho/Asian restaurants. I stuck with the Ramen noodle beef bowl, but I added the pickled vegetables which made the taste just great! No need for hoisin sauce, just delicious the way it is. The noodles are thick, fresh tasting and very delicious! Also tried the Lotus root salad, a scrumptious choice to start off the meal...highly recommend it, and it's perfect for 2! Awesome place to come to warm up from a cold day. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A go to \"homey\" place for me. Affordable prices and fair portions. I'm a fan of their rolled beef pancakes and skewers. Their hand pulled noodles are also always great.  I often come here when I'm craving a home cooked meal!"}
{"text":"D+ for the marketing team and their efforts in naming this place! I've walked by this place a thousand times and if it wasn't for Yelp, I would've walked by again!  To their benefit though, I didn't judge this book by its cover. Turns out, it was pretty good!   Took recommendations and got Sliced Beef/Oxtail in Chili Sauce, and ordered the Braised Beef with Pulled Noodle/Knife Cut Noodle. Also got BBQ tendon for good measure since I'm excessive that way.  Sliced beef was awesome! Great flavour, and plenty of meat! The soup was great too, with subtle flavours of anise, with a light broth. I definitely liked the pulled noodles better though as they were chewer and less heavy to eat.   I couldn't go past the first bit of tendon though - probably needs to be braised ahead of time as it was equivalent to chewing on an eraser that was over salted and burnt.  Let's be clear here - This is not Japanese ramen, so don't compare apples to apples. This place does stand up though, so if you're looking for this specific style, I'd give it a shot."}
{"text":"I had the handmade noodle with beef. I had expected way better. The noodle had a good texture, but it could have used more beef and more radish. The broth turned me off... it wasn't very flavourful and reminded me of those instant noodle flavours (too much MSG perhaps), but if you like that, then great for you. So-so experience.  Also, I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning the next day from this."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go eat during my study breaks! The hand pulled noodles there are absolutely phenomenal, and it comes in a decent portion in comparison to the price. As a student that is on a budget, it is really rewarding to be able to go to homemade, and have a nice bowl of fresh noodles for $7.99.   It is also something different from all the other noodle and ramen shops around chinatown, This small but busy restaurant gives a sense of comfort and authenticity of chinese style noodles.  Would 100% recommend; I've been there maybe only a handful of times, but my experience there with the food and costumer service have been great every time. In terms of recommendations for food, its good to just stick with the tradition beef noodles. Simple but full of flavour.    I also know that they sponsor a lot of student clubs too, like CASS UTSG, and other asian societies at UofT. Members get 10% off if they show their membership card."}
{"text":"Came across this restaurant when my boyfriend and I were searching for a new ramen place to go to on Yelp in the area. Came in at lunchtime on a Sunday and the place was packed. We waited only 10 minutes for a table.   What sparked us to come here was that the noodles were made in-house (hence the restaurant name \"Homemade Ramen\"). We ordered the House Ramen with Beef and the House Ramen with Braised Beef with the Cold Steamed Noodles to share. The Cold Steamed noodles were unlike any dish I have tried before with bean sprouts and julianed cucumbers on the top and thick, delicious noodles on the bottom doused in an oily spicy sauce. The stand out in the ramens were definitely the homemade noodles - the broth was nothing special and not Japanese style as expected. The braised beef was also very fatty. Most of pieces I couldn't eat because it was all fat.  Overall we enjoyed the food here. I would come back for the cold steamed noodles but maybe try some other dishes on the menu other than the ramens we tried, as this seemed like a popular place to the Chinatown locals."}
{"text":"Visiting from the States. Came here with my cousin for some traditional beef noodle soup. It definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Fast and decent service for a Chinese restaurant. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but as a ramen place I figured a noodle dish was the way to go. My sister ordered the beef noodle and I got the vegetarian cut noodles. For both of our dishes the noodles came out clumpy and stuck together like they've been sitting there for awhile. Portions were very generous compared to GB hand pulled noodles, but if you want fresh unclumpy noodles, I'd still go to GB."}
{"text":"Hand pulled noodles without having to travel to East! We ordered the pork ribs hand pulled ramen and beef hand pulled ramen. Also got the spinach vermicelli 'cause vegetables are good for you :)  The ramen here is not your typical ramen. It's thicker, soft yet chewy. You can definitely tell the difference. Nice portion; noodles seemed never ending. Broth was very light and really brought out the freshness of the noodles. Meat was a bit skimpy though for the amount of noodles given. They do have an option to add more meat for an additional cost so it's something to consider for next time. The spinach was really good, nicely flavored. We also ordered lamb skewers but they never came. Maybe next time.   Excellent option in Chinatown for noodles. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I believe they actually make the ramen in-house, and the soup was tasty. Fair value starting at $8, but the meat was too little. They can add extra meat for $2 and egg for $1 per portion. They automatically serve tea as soon as you sit down, which is a nice touch. Service and ambience were okay."}
{"text":"Hand pulled ramen with hot and sour pork was good, but as other reviewers have pointed out, it is not Japanese-style ramen. I liked it nevertheless. The best deal was the plate of \"spinach and vermicelli salad\" I had, which is a cold appetizer dish of boiled spinach and glass noodle. You get a lot of spinach for 2.99.  A bottle of Heineken was reasonably priced at 4.00.  While the tables were little bit too close to each other and the place did not have the ambiance of classic Chinatown open-kitchen restaurants, I saw lots of younger customers many of whom were couples."}
{"text":"Stopped by here since my sister and I were in the area. We were seated right away, near the back of the restaurant. I got the stir fried hand pulled ramen with chicken (what a name!) and I found it kind of bland, I wish I got it with beef instead. Service was subpar, nothing special. What was cool was that we could see the cooks stretching the noodles and you would hear every slap throughout the restaurant. I have heard good things about this place and I shall come back, hopefully making it a better experience than the previous one I had."}
{"text":"Sliced noodles were abundant but a bit oily  Prices are good here but waitresses are a bit cold  Came here again for the Lanzhou Beef Ramen. Meh, again 2* & cheap prices"}
{"text":"Had the braised beef hand pulled noodles. The soup itself was pretty good and comparable to Philly and NYC Chinatowns. However the braised beef had way too much fat. I would've enjoyed it more of the ratio was balanced. Maybe the sliced beef one would be be better. I also tried the sliced beef sesame biscuit which was mediocre. It was crunchy and the flavor was not bad but there's nothing special there."}
{"text":"With some many noodle places to choose from in Chinatown, it's easy to miss Homemade Ramen. This place was bustling when we walked in at lunchtime. I wasn't hungry at first, but after waiting for a bit and smelling the sweet soupy aroma, I was ready to eat! I like the thicker texture of the handcut handmade noodles. The braised beef was tender and wel- marinated, even the tendon pieces were soft and easy to eat. My bowl of noodle soup seemed neverending! The meat to noodle ratio was definitely on par, maybe even too much beef! Although the menu indicated that the noodle soup is spicy, I couldn't taste the spice in the soup and had to add in more hot sauce that was provided on the table. For $10 (including tax and tip), you definitely your money's worth. And especially on cold winter days like today, a bowl of steamy hot tasty noodle is exactly what I needed!"}
{"text":"Mixed bag this one. We had the hand-pulled noddle ramen with beef, the sliced noddle ramen with beef, and beef pancake, lamb skewers, spring rolls, and dumplings as a side snack. The ramen soup was nice and tasty. Both of them. The skewers weren't well done, and the beef pancakes were served cold. Spring rolls and dumplings are nothing to wrote home about. So, go for the ramen and skip the rest. And don't enter our look into the restrooms. As with, sadly, most Chinese restaurants it is an area to avoid."}
{"text":"Great fast service for a chinese restaurant.We got there at 10:25 when they were closing at 10:30 and they served us.  The noodles tasted very fresh and the prices were more than reasonable. They offer different cuts of noodles which are all different in textures.  Would totally recommend this place"}
{"text":"After reading the good reviews from Yelp, I decided to give this place a try and was really excited about having a great dish.  The place itself was clean, bright, and packed.  The waitress kept talking to me in Mandarin even after I said I couldn't understand her.   I decided to try the noodles with lamb and veg. It looked good when it arrived but then that quickly change. The sauce was okay but nothing special. The lamb was chewy. The noodles, which are made there, was a big disappointment.   Maybe I ordered the wrong dish, but it was enough to give them a two star rating. The way I look at it, the sauce and homemade noodles were at best average.   Good luck."}
{"text":"Was craving some carbs this cold af winter night and remembered this place that I've been meaning to try. Did not disappoint! If you want some tasty, cheap, but filling chinese food, definitely check this place out.   I tried the beef ramen (the first one on the menu), spinach and vermicelli, and this sesame beef sandwich looking thing. Noodles were good - chewy, huge portions (can def split between two people) and broth was good.. not too salty not too bland. Can almost complain that there were too many noodles that it soaked up the broth. Spinach and vermicelli was really yummy.. it came with cashews as well, but kinda on the oily side. The sesame beef thing was super good.. no complaints. :)"}
{"text":"Been here twice and the food was great. The ramen tested amazing and the appetizer and side dishes were great too! 100% would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Homemade Ramen is DELICIOUS. It's so hard to find a decently priced restaurant with good tasting food these days... and especially difficult in Downtown Toronto! But this place really hits the spot. It's one of the cleaner places in Chinatown and the staff do a good job at maintaining the place and serving their customers.  The menu is also very extensive... be warned that you may spend quite some time just going through everything that's available. There's sliced noodles, hand-pulled noodles, stir fry, dumplings, bao, chinese hamburgers, cold dishes, etc (and I'm not even listing the 382901329 variations of each). Most hand pulled noodle places/ ramen places only have limited selection of flavours, so i really appreciate the diversity this place offers.  What's really great is that they have a chicken broth option too! Most chinese noodle places only have beef, pork-based broths... seafood if lucky. And they did a really great job making the chicken soup flavourful and homey tasting. I would definitely recommend the Chicken and Mushroom hand-pulled noodles if you are going for a wholesome feel-good type of meal.  Overall, super delicious food for under $10. See you very very soon Homemade Ramen :)"}
{"text":"I love noodles but maybe not the ones I got here. The price is great for portion size and the food comes out quickly. I wasn't super impressed by the noodles though. My friend and I both got the noodle soup and although it was filling, I think I'll give their fried noodles a try next time. I'm not sure if I just wasnt a fan of the noodle soup or if it was the noodles itself. They were really chewy and I eventually actually got tired of eating them as it became a workout for my jaw.   We also ordered a side of the shredded potato in chili oil and I really enjoyed that"}
{"text":"Price: $10/person, you got a large bowl of ramen Service: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Recommend: obviously the ramen dishes What to expect: Toronto has many Japanese ramen places, which has egg and rich soup. Chinese ramen is lighter, and you could try with beef, lamb, or different variety.  I went to this place for a meetup lunch event. I had some ramen back in China, this place is pretty good, more like a non-fancy warm-your-stomach home-cooked ramen. I had ramen with beef and sour cabbage, which I really liked. The sour cabbage gives extra favours. The waitress is pretty friendly and the place is considered to be clean in Chinatown. I would probably come back again with my ramen-enthusiastic friends."}
{"text":"This is definitely where I go when I crave home cooked Northern Chinese food. I've been here 3 times and plan to keep coming back!  I've tried the dan dan noodles, sesame beef pancakes, cucumber salad, and the lamb skewers - everything was great. My boyfriend didn't like the hand pulled noodle soup since the meat was too fatty. He loves the dan dan noodles though.   The portions are huge, if you order a noodle dish and aren't 10/10 hungry, be prepared to take half of it home.   Also the menu is pretty straightforward/short for a Chinese place. I hate it when Chinese restaurants have 15 pages of options!"}
{"text":"Nevermind the naming misnomer because the noodles here that are served aren't what one would conventionally classify as ramen. This is one of those places where you focus on the noodles rather than the broth of the soup. Most places I usually go to are the inverse of that, but variety is nice ya' know?  I had the braised beef noodle soup and the following quote from a past review really sums it up perfectly:   \"The pulled noodles are chewy and delicious, and the broth is light and flavoured perfectly.\"   Also nice to see them making the noodles as you eat. Definitely helps knowing that your noodles didn't come out of a prepackaged bag, cause how ironic would that be?"}
{"text":"Very good, fresh, chewy noodles.  WAIT: Came on a Saturday night around 6pm and there was no wait.  After us, people trickled in and some had to wait but never more than 5 or so minutes.    ATMOSPHERE: The inside is pretty simple with tables located in the front area near the door and then further back.  The restaurant can seat a good amount of people and there are booths as well as tables.  We sat near the door which was a little annoying since it was freezing outside but when asked to move they said no.  The wait staff here is a little  frazzled and it's kind of hard to get a hold of them.  FOOD: you order by writing what you want on the piece of paper and then handing it to them.  The menu can seem confusing so I would ask questions or look at pictures.  HOUSE RAMEN - (1101) in case you didn't already realize, this is not real Japanese ramen. It's basically hand-pulled noodles that Chinese people eat (similar to Lam Zhou or Tasty hand pulled noodle in NYC).  The noodles are thin and very chewy, springy and fresh. I have to say it may be the best noodles I've had with this type of soup.  The soup itself is basic beef soup with thin slices of beef (similar to in pho) and veggies.  SLICED NOODLES - I swear I ordered 1209 but when it came out, it was stir fried and not in soup.  Some of the labels say in soup so the others probably aren't.  I think in the end, they thought I ordered 1210 (the lining of the numbers and their descriptions seem to be a bit off).  In the end, I wasn't disappointed.  The sliced noodles are more like knife cut, roughly cut, scissor cut noodles that are equally as chewy but more flat and thick.  Very good.  I got it with veggies so it came with lots of choy, celery and tomatoes.  I think if I were to ever come back I would try it with soup but the stir fried was very good.  Overall, definitely recommend if you love noodles."}
{"text":"HUGE serving of yummy ramen. I'm SO sad I only found this place now, but know that I will be back! I got the chicken, and my friend got the braised beef. VERY different, both quite delicious.  I'm never a fan of chicken in broths so that was so-so (I was sick so I had no choice) but my friend said the beef was delicious.  We also got the green onion pancake which - well super greasy but still pretty good. I like the thicker fluffier ones usually but still pretty yummy.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"So yum!! My family came here when we came in vacation to Toronto. This ramen place was very yummy! It definitely satisfied our hunger at a late hour"}
