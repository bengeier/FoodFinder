{"text":"This is the hip place for sorority girls to get their avocado and smoothie fix, so you don't want to like it-- but it's so good (and so cheap). Get the avocado spring roll with chicken or shrimp: a gigantic burrito-sized roll for under $4. Only drawback is there's often a big line, and it moves slowly, so go in the off hours. The lady who owns the cart is so friendly. I love supporting this place-- although it doesn't seem like it needs the help."}
{"text":"This place is flippin' amazing, with a super sweet owner. The gigantic spring rolls are super cheap and full of fresh ingredients. Comes veggie style, or with avocado, chicken, tofu, or shrimp. I haven't tried the smoothies yet, but they look pretty good."}
{"text":"I think I'm obsessed. I've made it a Saturday Farmers Market tradition to grab a smoothie and a spring roll then leisurely peruse the stalls.
Everything is amazing- I've had the avocado mango peach smoothie and the avocado carrot coconut smoothie. Both of which were delicious, I was admittedly a little skeptical about how the later would taste because I love fruit smoothies but I was very pleasantly surprised.
As for the spring rolls, a picture is worth a thousand words. They are massive and filled with super fresh delicious ingredients. She doesn't skimp on the avocado or try to fill it with excessive amounts of rice noodles.
Be prepared to wait if you come around lunch time because there will be a line but it is oh so worth it."}
{"text":"the taste of spring roll is the best in Madison, well-balanced"}
{"text":"This place is seriously the best.  You may have to wait a couple minutes but you get your order freshly made.  They make fresh fruit smoothies, my favorite being mango papaya, and they make fresh spring rolls the size of burritos, for only 3 dollars! I always get an avocado shrimp spring roll, and the best part is that the avocado is actually ripe so you're not chewing down a solid, nonmushy avocado.  If you want fresh food at a great price, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Love love love their food!! So fresh and cheap. Feeling healthy after eating it lol. The spicy sauce add so much favors and it tastes so good. I got the shrimp avocado roll all the time and will definitely go back when I can. But there is only one lady working in the food court so be ready to wait more than 30mins if you go at lunch time."}
{"text":"This is not a good cart to stop at if you're in a rush, but it's a campus favorite for a reason! I typically wait about 20 minutes, but when it's summer time in Madison it's not even an issue. Just gives me an excuse to people watch.She's also improved over the past couple years by now taking names instead of randomly calling out orders. 

The spring rolls range from only $3-4 and are SO fresh. I'm talking best spring roll of my life fresh. And they're massive! I like spice, but I will warn that the spicy spring roll really has a kick to it. 

Today I splurged and also got the mango tango smoothie with mango, orange juice, pineapple juice, and banana. It's one of the few places where I don't feel like I'm getting ripped off with an excessive amount of crushed ice in it. And the sizing is appropriate for the cost. If you haven't explored this food cart yet, it's an absolute must!!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with a spring roll and boy, I did not know what I was missing! The long line at this food cart usually deters me from trying it but I waited behind about 4 others today and it was well worth it. The food cart advertises their smoothies but they are much better known on campus for their $3 avocado spring rolls. I got a chicken avocado spring roll with medium sauce which comprised of chicken, avocado, lettuce, rice noodles, spinach, cucumbers shredded carrots and cabbage wrapped in rice paper. I chose medium rather than mild or hot sauce and I could definitely feel the spicy kick, but it was nothing unbearable. I was ravenously hungry at the time and ate the entire thing and feel very satisfied and refreshed afterwards! They give you a good amount of napkins which is helpful because, despite the sturdy rice paper, it can get a bit messy! Overall, this was a great experience and if you are willing to wait a bit in line, you should definitely try this place for a filling meal!"}
{"text":"This definitely our go-to drink cart. They have almost every combination of fruits to make into a smoothie you can think of and the prices are more than fair for what you get. The woman is as sweet as can be, she is always really cheerful which makes your smoothie experience that much better. I usually get the mango-strawberry-peach in a medium or a large, I have yet to try any other flavors because I'm so hooked on this one-but I definitely want to expand my choices. The only con to this cart is the wait time. It's very lengthy, but she always seems to keep a line because it is the smoothie spot to hit up and worth the wait. We usually go here and then pair the smoothies with another food cart's food and that's lunch. However I hear really good things about the spring rolls here. They look fresh and filling. I definitely wouldn't mind giving one a try."}
{"text":"Incredible value and taste - not to be missed!! The line is typically 30 minutes us but well worth it. They save well too for 24 hrs in the fridge so pro tip buy 2 and eat one later or give it to a friend."}
{"text":"Tsuey is the girl. Her spring rolls are an incredible deal for only $3.50 and her smoothies are the tastiest. I frequent this cart (as do many college students) about 3 times a week. I wouldn't want to support anyone else as much as I do her!"}
{"text":"If you are on campus and ever wondering whether it is worth it to get in the longest line in the food trucks, yes it is worth it. Tuy does amazing fresh fruit smoothies. The reason it takes so long is that she takes the time to say hello and remember you. She also makes her avocado spring rolls and smoothies to order! Oh right, I forgot. Get an avocado spring roll! For 3.50 you get a burrito sized spring roll that is filling enough in itself! My favorite is the chicken.

We like this cart (along with her sister's cart Luang Prabang) so much that we asked Tuy and her sister to cater our wedding. Guess what? They made awesome food for that too. If you like massman curry or pad thai check out the cart right behind Tuy's too!"}
{"text":"An ideal day, for me, goes like this:

I hop on my bicycle and head out to find this food truck. I order a deliciously fresh all fruit smoothies and a spicy spring roll. 

I consume the delicious fruit smoothie for breakfast and put the spring roll away in my pack (for lunch!) and ride off into the sunshine. 

The best. 

This place is healthy, fresh, delicious, and CHEAP."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that when the owner named her store \"fresh cool drinks\", she meant fresh. The moment I saw her grab a lemon off the counter for my lemon-raspberry smoothie and cut it fresh for me, I knew I was in for a treat. Little did I know that the star of the show here, even more than the smoothies, is their spring rolls. These things are HUGE, full of fresh-cut veggies, and seasoned and spiced to perfection. One bite and I was hooked. They're a bit messy but oh-so worth it. Also, make sure to say hello to the owner who makes everything herself; she's so adorable, so talkative, and so sweet. I was talking to her about visiting UW-Madison and she was so interested, and she sounded so enthusiastic about her customers and people in the area. It made me feel fab about paying for her food, which, by the way, is so reasonably priced: $2 for a huge spring roll, $2-4 for a smoothie. This place rocks. You will not be disappointed. 
 

Long story short: the spring rolls are glorious, the owner is the sweetest woman alive, the smoothies are fresh and delicious, and it's all reasonably priced. Win-win."}
{"text":"This is my favorite food cart if I'm in the mood for something cheap and healthy. I always get the avocado spring roll with chicken and the medium spicy sauce! Soooo good. All ingredients always taste fresh and the lady is the sweetest! She makes your spring roll right when you order, so you know it hasn't been sitting around."}
{"text":"I've seen this cart on Library Mall for years, but I've never ventured to order something from them. What, spring rolls? How good could they really be? And smoothies? Nah, I want a hot lunch. 

What was I thinking, because this place is delicious. After hearing others rave about this place, I decided to check it out today for lunch, and I'm so glad I did because this will forever be a favorite. $3.50 for a massive fresh spring roll filled with cabbage, spinach, cucumbers, and avocado. You can add some protein to it by choosing shrimp, tofu, or chicken for the same price. When I say massive, I mean that it's burrito sized. Spring roll wrappers aren't exactly meant to hold that much liquid, so eat fast once you get going, but even if you're not speedy, the mess at the end is still totally worth the deliciousness throughout. I also find this to be a particularly awesome invention. It's a salad on the go. A few other carts also sell these gigantic spring rolls, but I really like this cart's sauce compared to a different cart. 

I also got a a small smoothie - mango with pineapple, and it was tasty without being overly sweet. A small smoothie with the spring roll came out to be $6.25, and it was more than enough for lunch. 

The only downside is the wait. She prepares your order one at a time, so spring rolls are freshly wrapped and smoothies freshly blended."}
{"text":"The Good: The owner is a wonderful, friendly woman who is beloved on campus. Her spring rolls and smoothies match her sunny demeanor. The food is cheap, delicious and always sufficient enough to fit the bill as a full blown meal. 

The Not So Good: This is not Madison's best kept secret - because it is no secret! Prepare to wait in line. For a while. Many have been known to brave such lines despite stormy skies and cold winds. 

The Highlight: Order the honeydew watermelon smoothie for a refreshing drink that lives up to the food truck's name. Ask for pad thai in your spring roll to shake things up!"}
{"text":"Tuy is the bomb! 
Not only is her food good but she is one of the sweetest people I have ever met who truly cares for her customers!

I am a HUGE fan of the spring rolls with shrimp, chicken and avocado (all rolls include cucumber, lettuce, spinach, cabbage, peanuts and sauce). I recommend getting the spicy sauce on the side with it. All the vegetables and the meats are always fresh. For only $3, this is a great, healthy lunch- but beware its pretty messy. 

The smoothies are great during the summer time. I trust that all the fruit is fresh and not made from juice or canned fruit."}
{"text":"This is my favorite stand out of all of them in Library Mall. The spring rolls with avocado are a great snack and are actually pretty filling. The smoothies are amazing as well and there is lots of options to mix whatever fruit you want. There is always a line at this cart, but it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Delicious \"burrito\" take on spring rolls! Filed to the brim with lots of fresh veggies, vermicelli, your choice of protein and avocado, what's not to love? Love how fresh the veggies are and how light yet filling it is. Disclaimer: even the mild peanut sauce has a tiny bit of spice to it so maybe not the best for kids who don't tolerate any level of spice. In a time where healthy food is a craze, I enjoy this take on it. The prices are very reasonable for something so filling and fresh. Not to mention it's great (and wonderfully messy) to eat while strolling around the Farmer's Market. I'm a big fan of supporting small businesses, and I hope I can catch them around more often."}
{"text":"Ordered spring rolls not knowing they would be the size of my head. They were delish."}
{"text":"This food cart is absolutely adorable. I found it at the East side farmers market, but I've seen it around the Capitol square as well. It's painted green with some other bright, funky colors. 
It offers MULTIPLE drink options (seriously a lot of them) for a decent price. I ordered the strawberry/coconut smoothie which was refreshing and delicious. My smoothie was only $2.75 and was about a normal cup size. I can't wait to try the other flavors!
They also have some food options in case you want to try those."}
