{"text":"Surprisingly nice little neighborhood bar that you would never guess from the outside. It looks like a hole-in-the-wall dive, but its actually very clean inside with a good selection of beers and other drinks, pool tables, and even a dj on some nights. If you're looking for a no-frills, safe, place to get your drink on near 19th Avenue, you could do worse than checking out the Westwood."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood bar. I will admit it looks a lite ghetto from the outside, but the inside is surprisingly nice and clean. They have a few pool tables and a couple of dart boards. I've been in a few times and the bartenders and patrons are very outgoing and conversational. Also, they have very modest drink prices, and great Happy Hour deals. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went last Sunday to see our favorite bartender Sarah who is now working Sundays & Mondays there. Once we got passed the very sketchy parking in the rear we were super surprised by how clean and orderly this bar was! Being in/from the bar business this is a \"dive\" bar without the DIVE! We will be back! Cheap drinks too!"}
{"text":"Delicious hamburgers when you can actually get them to make one for you. Lately, there is a drunk that's there any time of day you walk in, who talks and sings over EVERY song on the jukebox.  He randomly sings Beatles songs that aren't even on the jukebox."}
{"text":"Last Wednesday after a long, bad day, on my way home, my best friend and I decided to check out this scary bar just to have a beer, still in our work scrubs, we were alil uneasy having to park in the back, lil did we know we were gonna be there until 1 am. First, we walk in and I go straight into the women's bathroom... now the bathrooms of places can tell you a lot! And this one did, it was crazy clean, looking like a very up scale club like bathroom... Lol. Then I make my way to the bar, and the very 1st thing I notice is, they have an amazing bar, I'm sure they could mix almost anything! Then I'm greeted with a happy hello and a smile from the bar tender, and I say, \"Hi, this is our first time here, so are their any specials, actually well just have 2 coronas, then she starts to tell me, \"Well hello again and welcome to our little \"CHEERS\" bar, So on your very 1st visit, your very 1st shot will be $1, so what would you like?\" Of course I order 2 Fireballs and 2 coronas... And just that was $9 altogether. Crazyness! Boy was I a happy camper, and of course the night began. Not only did they have a great bartender with a great attitude, the people are just your normal people that just need a lil place to chill out, have a drink, and chit chat and make friends. A great place to kick back and just leave your cares at the door. I like it, and I will be going back real soon!"}
{"text":"Old busted rude bartenders, tiny shot glasses, slow and all around lousy service.  Literally, The Worst Service on the Planet.  And Did I mention how bad the service is?"}
{"text":"I live in the Aves, so I knew what to expect. But this could be a shocker for some Street-side yuppies or plastics who are new to this side of town. This is the hidden dive bar sandwiched between the 7-11 and the drive-thru liquor store. Parking is in the back and can be sketch. Not an ideal place to park your new BMW/Infiniti/[insert expensive car here]. It might just be better to park your car in front somewhere.  On the plus side, there's lots of random, crazy people and cheap drinks. If you plan to come here, I'd try to dress down. They do have a killer TV setup; about 7 feet behind the bar for sports watching. It's weird how small bars can excel at minor necessities.  In summary, a decent dive to get a few drinks or shoot pool."}
