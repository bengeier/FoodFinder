{"text":"In the trendy area of Yorkville and surrounding areas, there aren't many Vietnamese/pho restaurants with the exception of Ginger (just south of Yonge/Bloor).  However, Ginger is more fast food than a restaurant and fairly high in salt and MSG IMO.  

Recently, I saw this place pop up on my Google searches, but I wasn't able to walk to the area due to meetings and injuring my foot.  Since today was a less busy day and I'm almost fully healed, I decided to check the place out. 

They have a good assortment of stir fry, curries and pho and lunch specials.  I had their lunch special which was stir fry vegetables, tofu and rice for $8.99. The food quality is above average and does the job for lunch. However, the service was impeccable.  Upon informing the server I was vegan, he was very accommodating and the food came out in 5 minutes. 

I'll definitely be back to try their vegetarian pho."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. I got take out on 3 orders of cold spring rolls and the rice paper had completely ripped open on 3 of them--it had clearly happened at the time of prep but was sent out anyway. The clear sauces smelled rancid and the spring rolls had no flavour. According to the menu, the chicken, beef and shrimp should all come with peanut sauce. One came with what tasted like very salty hoisin sauce that I imagine should have been peanut but with no peanut flavour whatsoever.  Where the rolls had ripped open, the greens inside were browning  and had wilted. The beef and chicken were both over-cooked to the point that the chicken was hard and the beef was beyond chewy. If one thing was wrong with it, I'd forgive it but with that many things wrong with three different orders it means that there is absolutely no quality control in the kitchen. For a restaurant that I believe has recently opened, that's kind of disturbing. For what I paid and the quality received, I say don't just walk by this place--run away!"}
{"text":"The last time I was here, a few months ago, there was a different business at this site, a Thai restaurant. It was pretty good so I was surprised that it closed.

I stopped in for lunch today and had a large bowl of Pho with rare beef and brisket. It was okay but the broth lacked some beefy richness that I like. The noodles and rest of the ingredients looked fresh and the portion was a good size. It filled the void nicely on a cold day.

I'll have to go back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I wasn't too happy with what I got the last time I ordered here.

I ordered through Ritual and the order was incomplete after we were supposed to arrive there. If I didn't check through it, we would have missed almost an entire order.

The Pho I ordered was a little heavy on the more exotic cuts of protein which I knew were in there, but the balance was way off. I also had their spring rolls which left a lot to be desired.

I might give it another chance, but if I had my vote, I'd go down the street instead."}
{"text":"I am so happy that there is a pho restaurant in midtown Toronto. Finally, there is soup more central! 

The owner and the atmosphere are lovely. The family works so hard and their commitment to customer service is excellent. 

The soup is perfect, I think. The broth has depth and is incredibly flavourful, and the noodles and quality of ingredients are great too. I'm thrilled to have Blooming Rose around the corner."}
