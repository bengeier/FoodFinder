{"text":"Please note that this review is based on my MealPal experience and may not be as applicable if you order from the regular menu.  Panino Cowboy stands out from the rest of the vendors at Queen Live Fresh Food Market.  It's not only because of its funky name, but it's more so the workers know how to play the game of winning over diners when you're a fresh mom and pop shop: providing good service.  We live in a commercial culture that runs on soft skills  being a key ingredient in the recipe for customer retention.  Panino Cowboy has emotional labour smack down.  Contrasting the usually dull and almost unapproachable atmosphere inside the food market, I had a very animated conversation with a senior member at Panino Cowboy.  In fact, he led the conversation and was the one to initiate it while I waited for my food.  Thank gosh he did because it allowed me to avoid the awkward silence one often encounters when you're the only one ordering at the time.  The small talk was appreciated and he pitched their next MealPal item in a very welcoming way.  I am curious now to say the least, and I'm usually a skeptic with food!   From MealPal, I received the boneless rib bowl, a new item on their menu.  I order rice dishes with great caution on MealPal.  The chances of receiving a meal that is 80 percent rice is just too high.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the boneless rib bowl's ratio of ingredients.  The bowl came in a decent size and contained rice, ribs, BBQ sauce, ranch sauce (or something along those lines), home-made mozzarella, and vegetables.  I would say only a quarter to a third of the bowl was made up of rice, which thrilled me because I am more carb-conscious with rice dishes.  There was a good amount of meat for a discounted bowl and the ribs were not overcooked and had enough girth to give a good mouthful.  The BBQ sauce that the worker recommended did wonders with harmonizing the flavours of the various ingredients, and the white sauce (possibly ranch) added an extra tangy kick to the dish.  If you're not a fan of sour foods, you should ask to leave out the white sauce, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Please note that the bowl comes loaded with sauce by default, so if you  prefer drier rice and want to cut down on the calories, just ask the workers to go light on them.  They make the MealPal items fresh on the spot when you arrive, so if there aren't many other patrons around, it probably won't hurt to ask them to customize your bowl a bit (just don't go too far and ask for different ingredients).    I recommend stopping here for a quick lunch, and if you're using MealPal, you're sure to become a regular!"}
{"text":"Two times in a week! I can't remember when was the last time I updated a first review so quickly after I wrote it.  We had lamb sliders this time. I was almost hesitant to try the lamb this time because the porchetta was so good last time and I wanted this time to be just as good, but I did it. It was just as good. Had I not had a number of other restaurants to go to after this one, I'd have ordered the porchetta sliders as well. Mmmm..  The lamb was in nice, big chunks, and it was juicy and tender and absolutely delicious. Because I ate at a table this time, I got to see a little bit better what was in my slider. There's a slice of homemade mozzarella in there, and it's not a thin slice, which is fantastic because I love fresh mozzarella.   Next time, I'm doing 1 lamb and 1 porchetta. That way, I get the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"I had pulled turkey with rice (carrot,celery), white beans, grilled zucchini with home made barbeque and some type of cream sauce, got hot sauce and jalapeno sauce on the side. My meal and jalapeno sauce was super yummy. White beans were a bit on the sweet side which i like very much, turkey meat was well cooked and juicy, grilled zucchini was just right.  I am giving 3 stars rather than 4 stars because the amount of turkey should have been more... When i order pulled turkey bowl I expect more turkey then beans..  It is a small take-out place, you can use the tables outside to eat. I was gonna taste a bit and eat the rest in my office but it was so super yummy I end up eating 2/3 of it at the outside table :))   The staff were very nice and friendly. The food didn't have the mass restaurant taste, you can tell that everything was freshly made. It was properly portioned for one serving, I would like to try the rest of the meals in this Italian place for sure."}
{"text":"Yay! I love this place :) I kind of think that plaza on Queen west (where this is located) is sort of cursed.... RIP Meli Baklava. So i usually avoid it because it always seems like those business' don't care and then close in like two months. This sandwich wasn't what I expected but in the BEST way. I kind of was expecting a small panini with really tough bread, but this was the opposite. The sandwich was huge, and the bread was so soft and yummy. I got the shredded chicken, was so good. I'll definitely be back. People working there were also so nice."}
{"text":"It's never fun writing a less-than-glowing review for a small, mom-and-pop type establishment, but what choice does one have if the food is mediocre?  After walking by the sign a million times, I decided to finally stop into the Queen Live Fresh Food Market and give Panino Cowboy a shot.  I opted to order the Cowboy (\"Breaded, baked (not fried) steak with tomato sauce, topped with giardiniera (Italian relish) and house-made mozzarella\") and I was asked if I wanted it medium spicy or \"super\" spicy. (I went, of course, with the latter.)  I got the sandwich a few minutes later, was impressed by its heft, and took it outside to eat. It's...okay, I guess.  The big, insurmountable problem here is the aforementioned \"breaded, baked steak,\" which I noticed came directly out a deep tray that was full of tomato sauce. Would it surprise you to learn that the breading and the steak were soggy as hell? And that that sogginess in turn made the rest of the sandwich mushy?  The sandwich was otherwise nothing too special. The giardiniera did add a nice flavor, but it was so sparingly applied that only about half the 'wich benefited from its presence. I hardly noticed the cheese at all. And the whole thing was decidedly not \"super\" spicy.  It's clear that the Cowboy would be well served if the breaded steak was cooked fresh each and every time, with the tomato sauce applied over top as the sandwich is being prepared. I feel like that would be a delicious sandwich.  Hopefully this review will convince the owners of Panino Cowboy to go that route."}
