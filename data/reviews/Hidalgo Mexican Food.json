{"text":"This place is decent Traditional Mexican Food, better than the 2 other Mexican restaurants right across the street from them! I will opt out of getting food delivery as they DO NOT use restaurant employees for delivery and go through different delivery companies that offer their service. If you choose not to be lazy and visit the restaurant you will see they are very clean, very friendly and the food is very good and is decent quality, you definitely get your money's worth! I recommend everyone to visit the place and try the food don't pay attention to the bad reviews on here, the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"I had a quick delivery. The family pack was generously porprtioned, yummy. One can snack on it all weekend.  Great for football weekends. Recommend sending chips and salsa with dinner too, they aren't included and I didn't know to order. I will call again."}
{"text":"Place has good food..  but they took my order threw grub hub and never showed up.. when I tried to call the resturant the number was disconnected. Glad I used grub hub and was  able to my money back!"}
{"text":"The prices are reasonable but the food is fantastic. Made to order and made right.  I will save as a favorite and encourage you to try it. Go for some things on the menu you never tried also. Either way, you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"This was my favorite go to for tacos until today, I always recommend hidalgos to any family members who want good cheap tacos! Well today we went in and ordered 8 tacos and two drinks, I then made a separate purchase for a small quesadilla for my daughter. We got out quesadilla super quick as we usually do get our food pretty fast... well I noticed about 3/4 people get there food that ordered way after us, so I asked the guy how much longer until my tacos were ready and he said \"what tacos\" uhm the tacos I just ordered that was \"13.00\" he said we don't have any thing here for that do you have a receipt, yeah let me get it so I walk to the table and grab the receipt, he starts to go through his receipts again... well he never wrote or order down so they never made it I repeat my order 6 times before he finally got it right so after 45 minutes of waiting my food comes out, and my order is completely wrong. I state to him my order is wrong his response \"oh ohk\" never made it right. So the two extra tacos that sat on my plate I have them back to him and said hey thanks for my tacos I never got and he laughed, steer clear if the two young guys are working, if it's the women they always take care of us and know exactly who we are, as for the two young guys working this night... I'll definitely avoid it if I see them behind the window cooking or at the register."}
{"text":"This place was so yummy! Before I moved to AZ, I would have told you that o don't like Mexican food, but this is one of the places that changed my mind. They were really sweet to us, and the food was pretty great. We had enchiladas and quesadilla, and the rolled tacos. I did have to knock off a star for the tacos - they were tiny and dry and not very good. Their guacamole isn't all that good, either. Unlike a previous reviewer, I didn't get random chunks of avocado. I got actual blended guacamole. But it could have used more flavor - I ended up adding salt and pepper to mine before eating it on anything. 

Overall delicious, with a couple disappointments. We will order from here again, though, for sure."}
{"text":"Found this place on grub hub and ordered it...it took about an hour and a half to get here and when it did the food wasn't even good smh I feel like I wasted money cuz I didn't want to cook smh"}
{"text":"This afternoon we went to Hidalgo Mexican Restaurant, after stopping a local and asked where we can eat great Mexican Food. She immediately suggested the Hidalgo Mexican Restaurant.  We are from Central California and are Mexican.....and we know Mexican food
I had the Camarones Diabla Rancheros. It was delicious!!! The others in my group had the taco plate. They loved the food and will definitely will return. 
The waitress was very friendly and helpful.  We will be back"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! We ordered our food at 2pm and it was expected to be delivered at 3pm. Finally at 4pm I called them and the woman couldn't speak English very well but what came out of the conversation was that they weren't delivering the food. But they have already taken our money. This place doesn't know how to run a business. It needs to be closed down!"}
{"text":"*DONT ORDER FROM THIS SHIT HOLE*

We ordered using grub hub about an hour and a half ago. We are still waiting to see if this pig slop shows up. Their phone number obviously goes to some pay phone in Mesa. No one answers it and it goes to voicemail. You'd think if you enjoyed being in the food business, you wouldn't dick over customers. If the trash ever even shows up, ill probably end up driving back to the dumpster restaurant and throwing it all over their floor."}
{"text":"We ordered from this place over two hours ago and still have not received our order. This wouldn't be such an issue if we didn't have two kids waiting for their dinner. After a while we made the kids some food, so now that is money and time wasted waiting on food that hasn't shown up. It's a Monday night and all we ordered was rolled tacos and some sides, there is no reason why there should be a 3 hour wait! More then likely won't be ordering from this place ever again!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall type best tacos, a steal at 99 cents. They are to die for. We found our new taco spot, next week will try the menudo."}
{"text":"Pedí tacos por el drive tru y  me dieron solo los tacos no limón , ni salsa , ni cevilletas , que les Cuesta  ? para eso les pagan  y pago mi comida no me la regalan que pobre servicio al cliente ...."}
{"text":"Love this place! The lady that worked there was super sweet and patient, food was so good. Great place to eat after church!"}
{"text":"Si quieres comer comida con sabor a casa tienes que visitar este lugar es mi lugar favorito y la gente siempre te atiende de lo mejor tiene de todo los antojitos esta riquisimos especialmente los huaraches y las guajolotas Te lo recomiendo!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy, delivered Mexican food- what else can you ask for? They do have a $20 minimum with a $3 delivery charge, but that's expected for quick door service. We ordered the cheese enchilada plate, carne asada burrito, rolled tacos with cheese and guac, and a side of chips and salsa. My two complaints had to do with the dryness of the burrito (stuffed with meat and rice) and the beans with the combination dinner. We had no issue receiving out food within the 45 minute window and the driver was extremely nice. I would recommend them if you're in the delivery area."}
{"text":"So much better than any 'bertos. Their $1 tacos (street taco style) are sooo good, and a decent size for the price. I was surprised to see their low rating on here, but then I noticed that all the bad reviews were from people trying to get delivery. maybe eating in is the way to go, but the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Well we ordered off of paypal sounded fun and new so we tried it. When I ordered I was given a time of completion. That time was 35 minutes.  So when I picked up at that time. My food was cold. The person that brought it to me said he didn't think I was coming. It had been ready for a long time. Needless to say by the time I got it home it was very cold. So cold that my cheese was not stringy and was just stuck there. The guacamole was just brown and black pieces of cut up avocado. That was on our fries, burritos, and the rolled tacos. (Please refer to the pictures I posted ) I ordered an extra side of pico de gallo @ $3.00 a side. I received a cup full of liquid salsa. Not the typical Freash chopped  tamatoes, onions jalapeños and cilantro. Very disappointing because I ordered an side of $3 chips to eat with the fresh version of pico. Then I asked for extra green salsa. I was told there was plenty in there for me I wouldn't need any more. Mind you I ordered 4 California burritos, 2 Carne asda fries, 3 rolled tacos, a $3 side of beans, and a $3 side of rice. I was feeding 7 people.  So yes I did need more and we did run out. $60 bucks wasted on garbage.  Over priced for the quality of the food!!!! WON'T BE DINING HERE AGAIN! Even though the paypal part was great. The food and services was awful."}
{"text":"One of the three taco shops my friend and I decided to visit in one dinner sitting. Ordered three tacos: cabeza, chorizo, and pastor. If I had to rate it I would give it a 7.5 out 10.  Enough meat and condiments to make your taco satisfying. Also can't beat the fact that it was only $3.23 for three as they serve $1 tacos daily. The only downside was the cabeza taco had a bit more oil and grease to my liking. Other than that chorizo and pastor were on point. Take it from me as I have tried many tacos in the AZ region and the prices cannot be beat nor the amount of meat and condiments given. Would try again."}
{"text":"I appreciate this spot because they're clean: in the dining room, the patio, and even the bathroom! The food was average. Then again, I only had a taco. Fair price and you're treated well. Also, a good place to hang out with friends because there is a beautiful  patio with lots of shade and a view of Broadway street."}
{"text":"Don't order them from Grub Hub, that's for certain.  It might not be fair to judge a restaurant based on the delivery of another, but we waited an hour and a half for an incomplete order, and food that has been sitting around fit at least an hour.  Everything is cold and most of it inedible at this point.  We have been trying to contact them for half an hour now, but the just goes immediately to a voice mail box that is full."}
{"text":"We ordered from this place off of grubhub. Although their delivery was done in a very timely manner they didn't put much effort in their food. The rolled tacos were hard and chewy instead of crunchy & apparently CHEESE cost a lot of money because in my Super Nachos order they forgot it. There was literally 25% of what there should've been not to mention it looked like a 3yr old put the order together. The cheese was also lacking in my boyfriends quesadilla. I would've ordered extra cheese right off the bat but they change an extra $3.00 just for that. So make sure you look at your order before you get it delivered or picked up."}
{"text":"Good food and delivery. Carne asada torta is yummy! Super nachos are good. They take awhile to deliver but the food is worth the wait once you get it. The hot sauce is awesome! I haven't tried anything else cause the torta is so good. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"To expensive and small portions. I would go across the street and eat at La Presa. Le Presa is a bit dumpy. But the food is great tasting, cheap and in large portions."}
