{"text":"Very limited menu, which was disappointing. The appetizer was lack luster, as it was only melted cheese and oil, which came out burnt and very greasy. The tacos were decent, but lacked imagination. The sangria was very run of the mill, and the service was atrocious. I have to say, we were very disappointed. It's over priced, and the hostess spilled sauce all over us, and did not even have the decently to apologize. We will be taking our business to other options, and will never come back. Go to Blanco or any other Fox concept, the food, ambiance and service will blow you away."}
{"text":"We decided to try a new place for dinner and we are glad we did. It has a very limited menu as the name implies. But the tacos are very good. The meat in the tacos was very tender. There were interesting combinations of flavors. My daughter is a vegetarian and there were choices for her. The service was excellent. The ambience was laid back and casual. They have a great patio that we can't wait to use when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Went and ate there for the first time yesterday.  Wooow the food and service was amazing.  Overall not to pricy staff was very welcoming.  Will be returning more often"}
{"text":"Tasty food if you can figure out which tacos are yours being that they are served on a platter every 10 minutes for the whole table. No consistency whatsoever from beginning to end. Waiter is the winner of the worst service award!  No need to explain that one! The manager was not much better as she was scared to even speak with us...she never did! Do not bother considering this place if you have a group of people as there are so many better restaurants around town."}
{"text":"This place is really really really bad. I would elaborate more but they're not worth the time they are bad. I've been here twice and I took my entire company here today for a just a simple happy hour and it is probably the worst place we've ever been to. Never come here."}
{"text":"I've been before and the service is generally aloof, but today was intolerable.  The food is good, albeit overpriced.    I entered the restaurant today and was not greeted by any staff member.    After washing my hands I returned to the restaurant and looked around for anybody to seat me.  I ended up seating myself at the counter overlooking the kitchen, in which there were two cooks 5-10 feet from me with a crystal clear line of sight to my presence.   After approximately 5 minutes of no acknowledgment whatsoever, I walked to the hostess stand and asked for a menu.  Without a word, she handed me a menu.  I returned to the counter and waited.   Nothing.  So after several minutes I walked back to the hostess stand, picked up the owner's business card from the counter and said to the hostess who was looking at me blankly, \"I guess I'll leave.  No one seems to want to wait on me.\"  She replied, \"Sorry about that.\"  Sorry Indeed.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Arcadia parents and families, PLEASE READ .....this is definitely not a KID friendly establishment. Last Friday , a group of neighborhood family's decided to go out for our typical Friday night outing. We typically go to our standard spot, LGO, but we decided on checking out the new spot in the neighborhood. A group of 6 adults and 6 kids showed up to TTW at 5:30 pm (fairly early for a Friday night) and the hostess gave us the sign that we had no chance of getting a table outside and especially with KIDS.   ----We ended up leaving and heading to the Vig which was more then happy to accommodate our group with KIDS at an outside table by the bocce ball court.----  Flash forward to 6-7-17, my wife, mother in-law and 2 kids , ages 1 and 3, decided to give Tacos, Tequila , and Whiskey another chance since it was a smaller group . We had a great meal and drinks, the server was very friendly and sweet to our kids .   Approximately, an hour into dinner our kids decided to run around outside, and yes, we were sitting outside . They are typical toddlers, running around playing with their cars and being silly . And admittedly, walking on the perimeter bench seating .   The manager walked outside and approached our table and said \" Excuse me , could you pick up your child from the floor (who was playing with Lightning McQueen car) and stop having your kids destroy our restaurant. Excuse me\" I replied, my kids are just being kids. He continued to lecture me that my children were a \"hazard\" to the staff and other patrons . My guess is that the manager, that will remain unnamed (who handed me his business card) does not appreciate kids at the restaurant.   And a few more rude comments were exchanged from him and a few from me.   I can promise you that my kids and the 4 others neighborhood kids, from last weekend at The Vig, were acting in the same manner with no problem from the restaurant.  Running around and being silly .   Bottom line .... the restaurant is NOT KID friendly and families please spend your money at LGO, the VIG , or MOD Pizza because this establishment is and ANTI Family Arcadia restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican Street taco restaurants in Phoenix! Amazing service and friendly staff. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food and drinks were good, especially the chicken chicharones. However, if you are with a large group make sure everyone has cash or one person is willing to pick up the tab. If you are at a table they DO NOT do separate checks. My friends and I found that out the hard way. Our waitress had to run the check 6 times because some had cash and some their cards. It was our first time there and that should have been told to us immediately. I would be willing to go back but they need to change that policy."}
{"text":"5 stars the food and drinks are phenomenal! We had the fish tacos, skirt steak tacos, pepper jack chorizo queso dip and purist margarita. We loved it all. Fun atmosphere and excellent service. Definitely a place we will be coming back to soon. Kevin was our server and he was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Carna Assada tasted like eating raw limes, Barbacoa tasted bland without all the sause, the vegan taco was terrible. The chicken and pork tacos were ok though."}
{"text":"Excellent place. Tacos are fantastic. Bartenders are super friendly. Favorite taco is the Barbacoa!! Highly recommend the grapefruit Margarita"}
{"text":"I'm not sure AZ is big enough for this donkey taco place. Seriously I couldn't for the life of me get a taco that tastes like a taco, everything was burnt, soaked in lime and I like salt but damn choke choke. How about Instead of Taco's tequila whiskey maybe tequila and whiskey shot flavored tacos? Also the manager looked like he had one too many drinks. I suppose he might be the mastermind behind these amazing concoctions.  I will give them a gold star for trying though. I mean they were so kind as to roll the trash can by my table so I can conveniently throw away my \"food\" without having to get up as they make their insipid journey through the front door out to the dumpster."}
{"text":"Initially when I went here I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I'm really glad I gave it a chance! Each server we've had has been well spoken and informed and has given great food and drink recommendations. If you've scrolled past the tips section of this restaurant, you might have seen a couple of tips from me stressing the fact that the carnitas tacos are insanely good. Well, I'm gonna beat a dead horse here and say it again: the carnitas are so friggin' tasty. I recommend trying the chips and salsa to start, the salsas are super fresh and spicy. We sat at the bar and really enjoyed our conversation with the bartender, he was really friendly and accommodating of any questions. This is a place I'm hoping to frequent often. If this long-winded review has bored you, here's the TL;DR- Eat here and order some drinks, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we were very impressed. Pickles was the bartender and he was really great.we started with the chips and salsa and they were all really good. Then we had the slider combo with a couple tacos. The shrimp slider was my favorite!!  The sloppy joe slider was good but watch out it's spicy. I thought the tacos would be better than they were, but they were still good. Totally recommend going. Can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"What can I say churros churros churros you have to get churros so damn good they're huge crispy on the outside fluffy and almost Raw but still cooked all the way now I didn't care for the chocolate sauce but those churros I want one right now writing this not for the tacos I had the beef tongue beef cheeks fish they were all good but by far the beef cheeks are my favorite fall apart tender and the sauce they match made it so good the fish one was my least favorite the tongue was good but didn't have that real deep meat flavor that I like in tongue chips and salsa for decent worth the few bucks that they charge I do have to say the tacos are very filling into a lot of taco shops lately and seems like they're getting smaller and smaller but charging you more these ones are nice size I like her server since it was our first time there gave us pretty good suggestions of what to get for Salsa's and tacos Taco Time to ask what we like and what he likes did I mention their churros are the greatest thing definitely back"}
{"text":"I was just introduced to Tacos Tequila Whiskey yesterday. This little spot is a great find. Great variety of street tacos. The Bloody Maria is.... damn! And, get this: though October on weekends we were surprised to learn that Mimosas, Bloody Mary's and Bloody Maria's were just 1¢. Sweet.   The restaurant resides in a repurposed service station, complete with garage door over the bar area and barn doors on one side which opens up the patio area even more when the weather is nicer. My only minor quibble is the less than comfortable yellow metal stools at the bar and high tops. Other than that, this is a place I'll be returning to regularly.  Service was on point, friendly and helpful with the menu. Ordering is a little different, done what I'd call sushi-style wherein you tick off your selections with a marker on the menu and wait for the goodness that are the tacos to hit your table.   I'm a fan of another taco establishment on Central that is also pretty damned good, but I'll have say the fare at Tacos Tequila Whiskey takes street tacos up a considerable notch.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try."}
{"text":"Solid a la carte upscale gourmet taco joint. Great, friendly service and some of the better tacos I've had in town. My favorites were the mushroom and the lengua tacos.  I usually go to Blanco for their shrimp tacos/fajitas, but this is a nice mixup because they have so many different taco options. They just need to add shrimp to the menu. One other thing that would be a nice addition would be a rice/bean side and maybe a street corn side."}
{"text":"New location and a interesting Taco/Tapas Bar. numerous beers on tap and the  SMASH Lager is smooth, crisp with nice flavour.  Tacos are ordered al carte and good mix of beef, chicken, seafood. Good selection of Mezcal,Tequila, but Scott list is limited.   Tacos were very good and street style. Attractive alternative to a sports bar for the millennial crowd."}
{"text":"Food's greats, drinks are great, a really cool atmosphere, but unfortunately the service we received brought this review down. I really want this place to succeed, but on a Saturday night where the restaurant is less than 25% full I shouldn't have to walk up to the bartender to get water since my server decided to play with a puppy for 20 minutes. It seemed like other tables where just like us, looking around and wondering why their server wasn't actually serving them, but instead playing with a puppy. On a positive the bartender was extremely helpful, got us water and cleared our plates when he saw our server wasn't being attentive."}
{"text":"We went after work for a get together and I can honestly say that this is one of the finest area bars around. The atmosphere here is nice, fun, and my coworkers and I really enjoyed ourselves. We ordered 3 main dishes to split between the 6 of us an it was more than enough food. Portions sizes are good and prices won't hurt the bank. We will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and incredible service. Recommend the grape fruit marg/cocktail!! The atmosphere and service were outstanding. Must try!"}
{"text":"I am disappointed that I could not like this place more; ordered a grilled shrimp Caesar salad and the dressing was incredibly spicy to the point it became difficult to eat. The staff and service was wonderful, and they had a great whiskey mule."}
{"text":"Good unique tacos at a responsible price. Service was fast and we never had to wait for a drink refill."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Loved the drink menu. The variety of tacos is to make all taco lovers rejoice! Yum yum yum!!"}
{"text":"I love tacos. I love TT&W's tacos even more.  Their tacos make other tacos taste like flavor spankers!  Great beer selection awesome open breathable space!  This is the opposite of a sleazy place, this is classy Taco deliciousness!  And it's really clean too...  Cheers"}
{"text":"Tacos Tequila Whiskey has been in my bookmarks for a while now and I finally had the chance to check it out tonight. With so much anticipation perhaps I set my expectations too high but was unfortunately let down.   I was with a party of 8 and when we arrived we were seated promptly. I was a little surprised they were able to accommodate the lager group.   We ordered drinks and started looking over the menu. From this point forward it was all downhill.  The waitress came over and told us that she can't split checks. It kinda sucks she says but it's just the way they do it.  I mean come on you can't split checks?   The ordering process was really cumbersome and what I think extremely inefficient. You order sushi style where everyone marks tick marks next to the taco they want and tallies it up. The sharpies she gave us did not work. I ended up getting up and grabbing sharpies myself. We went through 4 by the time it worked. When the food came out it was all on one plate and the waitress has to tell you what each taco is and you grab off that plate. The table next to us was really confused and had forgotten what they ordered and she had to go over it one by one. Like I said seems ineffective and that the restaurant may benefit from a traditional way of taking orders so there is no confusion.   The food ....... here is where they redeemed themselves. The tacos are actually really good. Lots of different flavors and juices. The meat is tender and perfectly cooked. I really enjoyed the catchete. The tacos were so good they basically melted in my mouth.   This place is far from my house so unless in the area I likely won't go back. I will end with this:  Food:  excellent.  Service & ordering: mediocre."}
{"text":"Came here on a date and sat at one of the community tables by the bar. Service was great. Have no complaints on my margarita! Started with the queso dip which is the only thing I wasn't impressed with. It comes in this small skillet but it's extremely hard to get the cheese on the chip. Ordered 6 tacos which were all delicious! I'm happy they are in my neighborhood and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"They had really good tacos, i have fish and asada tacos they were good but my favorite it was they churros it was the best churros ever had .I recommend this place"}
{"text":"Tacos are so good! Can't wait to go back! Tried almost every taco there, our favorite was the short rib and the pollo agave."}
{"text":"Good tacos, I did not think it was over priced. I did find the staff to be disinterested in working, as others have said. I would have prefers a better selection of margaritas, as there were only 3. I'll probably go back. Before 7pm, expect families and babies."}
{"text":"Pretty great designer tacos. Nice ambience and very nice servers. I took a variety of tacos out for the Super Bowl and we loved them. I also like the sushi style ordering method - checking a box with quantity of tacos.   Nice place."}
{"text":"LOVE. THIS. PLACE. We came here with our pup this past Sunday, sat outside and got ready to chow down on some tacos!   Drinks:  Michelada (with Modelo): Amazing. Pinche Paloma: So good! A grapefruit paloma, generous on the alcohol but no complaints ;)  Appetizer:  Queso Fundido Con Chorizo- Served with warm, salty freshly made chips! I was snacking on the chips before they cooled off, so yummy. The fundido was made with pepperjack cheese and topped with a super flavorful crumbled chorizo. My favorite part is when it cools down slightly and the cheese hardens- makes for a chewy delicious bite!   Tacos: Cachete de Res: This is a beef tongue taco. I am a beef tongue virgin and had heard that this is a very chewy meat and that it is not for everyone! I tried it on this taco and it was my favorite taco out of all three! Very flavorful and not at all super chewy, it was cut into small pieces and very easy to eat.  Asada: The Asada taco was so delicious and served as a great addition to the textures we were eating: chewy (beef tongue), tender (pork belly), and braised (asada). The meat from this taco immediately melted in my mouth and was VERY flavorful (just like everything else we had here)! Highly recommend the asada for sure.   Pork Belly \"Agridulce\": I was a little skeptical about this one, only because when we received the plateful of tacos, this one stood out to us: there was a big cube of pork belly right on top of one of the the tortillas. It was really difficult to eat this one for that reason, but I just cut the cube in half and ate it that way! It was really flavorful and the pork belly was very tender!  *All tacos were served with a few wedges of lime, and I am usually the first to go for the lime and douse my tacos in it, but the flavor in each of the tacos were so on point that I didn't even need to do that here!   Dessert:  Bourbon Tres Leches Cake: the person I came with is a total bourbon lover so he devoured this cake!   I am definitely coming back and trying out their brunch!  -Great date night spot -Outdoor Seating is dog friendly, we brought Mr. Boone! -Indoor/outdoor bar -Private/free parking lot"}
{"text":"The drinks were fine. The tacos were fine. The SALAD on the other hand was served blazing hot, which was pretty disgusting but why would you order a salad at a Mexican restaurant anyway? Our fault. The menu was confusing, and no one explained it to us. No one knew who's food was who's and they mixed it all up as it came out sporadically. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY- The SERVICE was the WORST. All of the wait staff had attitudes and would roll their eyes at you if you asked for something. We didn't have napkins, waters, chips, or salsa until 45 minutes into our meal. After asking the extremely rude waiter for the manager, she looked over at our table laughed and walked away. I will NEVER EVER EVER RETURN. And you should not even try it. How this place has even managed decent reviews blows my mind. Go to Mi Patio or Taco Bell and save $200 and your blood pressure from anger while you're at it."}
{"text":"We loved this place! Happy hour was amazing! The Pinche Sodas-cilantro line were amazing too! Everything on the HH menu were a good size. I highly recommend it! Can't wait to go back for tacos!"}
{"text":"Great food and Drinks  They had a great selection of drinks and the tacos were amazing! Service was a bit slow and everything was a bit overpriced. Atmosphere was excellent though, so I would highly recommend checking it out at least once."}
{"text":"My husband and I checked this place out shortly after it opened and we were pleasantly surprised!   Good: - drinks. great beer menu and really amazing cocktails - food is creative and we enjoyed the sushi order style of the tacos - the open concept is great - music was on point when we went  Bad: - it's a little awkward of a location due to being right off Indian School - due to the location being right across from a neighborhood, they have to close at 10pm due to noise ordinance which is a bit of a bummer, because everytime we've been here it's still pretty busy at 10pm and its a fun place to pitstop on the way home from a later dinner for the drinks  Overall, definitely a great place for happy hour or post-dinner drinks!"}
{"text":"Very \"bro\" atmosphere because of the two bartenders when me and my boyfriend were in. We were sat at a table near the bar and one of the guys in particular was extremely unprofessional. The WM open was on and they were talking about the women there and using profane language. They also kept flirting with our waitress which made it so uncomfortable hearing what they were talking about. We won't go back. Our tacos were way to oily but the carnitas one was good despite the oil."}
{"text":"Had the Queso Fundido Al Tequila which is queso that comes sizzling on a skillet. It was absolutely delicious! I definitely recommend it. It has a lot of onion which gives it a lot of flavor. We also had the Bourbon Tres Leches Cake for dessert which was good.  The staff was friendly and nice. Our server which was Alexis was patient and amiable.  I asked if it was a local business or a chain and I was told that they have locations in Denver and just this one in Phoenix, so that was interesting."}
{"text":"So much potential....but missed the mark for us. The food was great, and it's very likely we'll be back for lunch. Nice layout, decor, and atmosphere. We went for Friday happy hour and sat at the bar, there were about 6 customers at this time and two bartenders; Redding (sp?) and Missy. Anytime we wanted anything we had to hail them down, which is frustrating especially with such a small number of customers. Missy was friendly enough but pretty engrossed in a personal conversation so hard to get her attention, but the guy...oy vey... We felt like we were putting him out by being there. He did not engage in any way, made no eye contact and other than telling us how to order he really didn't tell us much of anything. Disappointed we heading to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers which was absolutely packed and ended up sitting next to a guy who had just left the taco place for the same reason. If they get some bar help that has some energy and enthusiasm we'd likely try again but for now we'll stick with the Vig which we know will be fun. Food was great, no complaints."}
{"text":"Meh Not quite what I was expecting. Quesa dip was great, tacos, nothing great, service questionable. Brand new, maybe they will tweak. Arcadia isn't all about $$$$$."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced appetizers that are pretty, pretty good. Also, have a $6 cab. Recommend finishing with the shroom taco. Shrimp taco might be to spicy for weaklings."}
{"text":"Love these street tacos!  There was a wait at 6:15 on the Thursday evening when 4 of us decided to try this new(ish) casual taco spot.  While waiting for our guests, I headed to the bar to try one of the signature cocktails, and  DH waited by the kitchen.  The very friendly manager came over to chat him up, and make food and drink suggestions, while I got drink suggestions from one of three bartenders who approached me at the busy bar.  I chose the Serrano Marg, a good choice, a spicy sipping drink.    The outdoor sitting area was surprisingly busy for an 100+ degree day, and we headed out to sit at one of the padded perimeter benches.  The hostess came to find us when our table was ready, we ordered the guacamole and chips, which arrived right when our friends walked in.  One fundido, eight tacos, two Palomas, and a few beers later, we were delightfully satiated.  The tacos all come on one plate, which would be okay, if they were marked in some way.  I ordered the Barcona (?) and the fish tacos; both delicious.  Service was excellent, at every step of the experience.  Our one complaint, and it's a big one, the music was SO loud that we could not hear each other, or our server. 15 hours later, my ears are still throbbing.   I'm wondering if that's why the orders are \"sushi style\"  with a list to check off.   There's that fine line between energetic and ouch, that other local restaurants like Chelsea's and Doughbird have figured out.  Turn the music down a bit, and this joint is perfect."}
{"text":"Not only does this restaurant have a vegan taco, they also take precautions to avoid cross contamination with meat and dairy products. The atmosphere is great for a fun dinner with friends. Staff is friendly and helpful. They give you a menu with a marker and you mark on it your food selection and quantity. Drinks are top notch as well.   Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place, my son and I came after boxing and we were starving.  Love the atmosphere and people we're so nice.  Best Brussel Sprouts and tacos were great.. so many it was hard to choose..  we will be back.  And can't forget the yummy Sangria."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! After visiting the two in Denver I had to try out this one in Phoenix! It is still hands down my favorite taco/margarita restaurant ever! Great service, great ambience, great food/drinks!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and had the best time! The bartender Javier made sure to explain the menu and specials to us since it was our first time. We ordered the tequila queso, tacos, and churros. The tacos were all amazing but my absolute favorite was the shrimp taco!!!! What matters to me at the end of the day is good customer service and Javier definitely made sure me had amazing service and a good time as well! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends for a little after work cocktail and tacos. Really great tacos and margaritas. Vanessa helped us and she was wonderful, even managed to get my friend a beer in a different glass since he is so particular.   Only reason for a missing star is that they don't allow for split checks, not because there system can't accommodate it, it's just there policy. Bring cash if you are coming in a group or just go somewhere else because that's such an inconvenience."}
{"text":"The drinks were delicious, the food was top notch, and the atmosphere was very hip and inviting. This is surely a place we'll go back to."}
{"text":"Our group went to this new spot in Arcadia on a Saturday night at 7:30pm. Being a party of six we were sat right away. The table was small for the plates, water glasses, chips and salsa. Venue itself is either actually or made to look like a repurposed garage complete with a glass/steel garage door. Being winter in Phoenix all doors and windows were open, made the restaurant feel like we were outside actually.  Server had an attitude on several accounts when we inquired about some missing food and drink orders but tried to make it up with politeness. I think she was flustered and busy with other tables but it was apparent she had a short fuse on a few interactions.   The Older Fashions and margaritas were very good, interesting twist on the classics. All the tacos were very good. They are small street sized but it hurts to pay $4+ per taco. They come out in a haphazard way, bunch of tacos on a plate and your table picks out who's is whose. This is part of the problem with confusing what orders we were missing."}
{"text":"Original name is Pinche Tacos, don't let the lame name fool you, they just have to be g-rated on the interwebs.  3 words that also make this place awesome: crystal clear ice. Any place that splurges on RO systems to get you not only good water but good ice, is a business that knows what the hell they're doing.   Dude seriously so delicious, the first time I tried it was in Denver and was blown away. Me and my now fiancé got tipsy and ate delicious tacos and fell in love with the place in Denver so it's nice to have a location here now where we can relive our sentiment. Anyways the tacos are great, most of them are not your traditional styled tacos but still super bomb, I haven't had one I didn't like. Their salsas are phenomenal. It's a cute date idea, for drinks I recommend the Paloma's."}
{"text":"Lots of tequila to choose,over 100 different kinds to pick from! The bar tender was pretty cool and let me add they make the drinks strong here! They truly want there customers to have a great time here and they pour the spirits heavy to insure it happens every single night. I have never seen so many gosh darn happy people in one place! My cheeks hurt from smiling so hard when coming here. I have never laughed so hard in my life besides my experience at tequila tacos. The environment is set up for you to have a good time and that's what you do here is laugh your buttocks off."}
{"text":"My first visit was a pleasant surprise. I don't know what I expected, but the drinks were really good and the tacos were full of flavor! I can't wait to go back during happy hour."}
{"text":"We stopped in Monday night and couldn't believe how packed this new place was!  Friendly and welcoming staff, super lively atmosphere, cool artwork, and delicious food too.  They offer happy hour pricing all day on Mondays and clearly the word is out.  We enjoyed the fries with sloppy joe and cheese on top, the slider combo (sloppy joe, roast beef au jus and shrimp with avocado), and 3 tacos (lamb, corn/cheese and barbacoa)...we'll definitely try the carnitas next time too as it looked delicious while they were preparing the meat.  Fun, neighborhood place with great drink and food specials."}
{"text":"Been a few times now, always on a Tuesday but mixed trips for lunch & dinner.  Every trip has been great. Service was very helpful and attentive.  Been with friends and fam, kid had a great time and loved guac.  We have made it through every taco and while best is agave chicken all have been good. Highly recommend. Oh and churros are amazing"}
{"text":"So, came here for happy hour on a Friyay.  Good stuff: Drinks! Strong and delicious.  Bad stuff: Food was tasteless and nachos had almost no toppings. Fries were too greasy and wet with oil. Wait staff was slow, took our happy hour menus immediately, and gave us our check without asking if we were finished... we wanted to buy another round!  Oh well."}
{"text":"Excited for another addition to Arcadia area & within walking distance of my work. Energetic & friendly staff with yummy food!!  The chefs & management are truly passionate about their food here!!!  And my drink was smooth & strong!  I sat at the kitchen counter to watch the action & passion of the chefs in their preparation of their food!  They were definitely having fun & enjoyed cooking up fabulous tasting food!!  They really do just make your chips when you order them.   Vince, my server (aka 'Napkin Ninja'), was exceptionally attentive with my napkins & drinks as the tacos were overfilling with messy deliciousness (at least with me & finger licking good lol).   The Queso was 'light' tasting not heavy. I think it was the flaming TEQUILA cooked with it that makes it very tasty mmmmmmmmmmm!!  The Brussels sprouts were fabulous without the sauce but other people love drenching it in the guajillo honey mayo.   All the meats on each of the tacos were tender but I was especially impressed with the lamb & the lengua (usually don't care for it but glad I tried it cause it just melted in your mouth).  For great lighter taste: the Cachete de Res & Asada. For richer, creamier taste: Cordero & Lengua (for someone who usually doesn't eat sour cream or avocado -the blends were delicious).  There are more to try mmmmmm.   Vegan lovers will love how the chefs have taken special care & preparations to make sure it will not be cooked or have touched any meat products.   Happy Hour will be Monday (all day) & Tuesday thru Sunday 3-6pm with a special menu.   What I've tried so far with full descriptions (all gone in my very happy mouth & tummy)-  Queso Fundido al Tequila: melted Monterey Jack cheese, tomato, onion, TEQUILA & served with just made chips.   Repollo Tiernos (little cabbages): fried Brussel sprouts, lime, spicy pinche seasoning, cotija with guajillo honey mayo.   Cachete de res: braised beef cheek, cabbage, cilantro & grapefruit salad w/ creamy avocado & tomatillo salsa.   Cordero: braised lamb shank, esquite, queso fresco, cilantro.   Asada: citrus marinated skirt steak, avocado, diced onion, cilantro & cotija cheese.   Lengua: triple cooked Colorado beef tongue, avocado, diced onion & cilantro w/ roasted tomatillo salsa & guajillo honey mayo."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I have been here a couple times now and both the food and service were great each time. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good margs.  I liked everything we ate:  Brussel sprouts, DF Beef Slider (my fav), beef cheek taco, and barbacoa.  I'd come back here but I am visiting from Houston.  The atmosphere was very cool too."}
{"text":"I think I found my new hang out. They have delicious to eat tacos they are small but well packed with meat. They have like garage style doors that are wide open and you get a nice breeze. A little industrial look I really like this place. Great staff I met the owner manager everyone was very sweet. Can't wait to try the Happy Hour :-) also I just tried to tacos but I'm dying to taste their guacamole:) love coming here, very happy to see Xavier working today, great service and great conservation  I know you all have noticed I come here a lot! Not just for the delicious food, not just for the refreshing drinks! BUT the employees are wonderful! Including the kitchen staff! I have gotten to know many & they always have me laughing & smiling!"}
{"text":"With so many places in the valley to get tacos, TTW really stood out for me! Great menu with a nice variety of DELICIOUS street tacos! Also great snacks and fun drink menu. Loved the pork belly taco and - yes, be brave and try it - the Lengua! Spacious, modern interior, with a big patio that is shaded from the unforgiving Arizona sun. It gives the whole space an open feel. Yeah, the ordering system is a little goofy but we had a great server who took great care of us. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a casual lunch/dinner with friends or a date - it's a really fun place to get a big plate of tacos to share :)   My boyfriend and I stopped in yesterday around 3 PM and sat on the patio, which was amazing (especially when it's 75 degrees and sunny in December). I loved the atmosphere and decor, it's a really open and colorful restaurant, and I really liked our waitress.   To start we ordered beer and the Queso Fundido con Chorizo, which was one of my favorite quesos that I've had (and we order a lot of queso). It was still sizzling for like a minute after they dropped it off at our table, and the flavor was amazing - I love that they just use pepperjack cheese, and lots of it :)   For an entree, we ordered tacos from the main menu which was \"sushi style,\" so we got to choose from a bunch of tacos. We tried 5 different ones, and they all came on a big platter for us to share from. We had the Pescado, Asada, Barbacoa, Pollo Agave, and Pollo Molcajete, and each was super tasty! I don't have complaints about a single one (well the piece of fried chicken on the Pollo Agave was really small, but it tasted amazing so that's okay). Each of the others had a great amount of meat, were cooked and seasoned well, and paired with great toppings!   I do wish they had tacos on the happy hour menu, but that definitely won't keep me from coming again!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Second time here and the tacos are the best tacos I've had. The drinks specials are always awesome. The staff is excellent!!!!!! The atmosphere is great too. You can be inside or out but never without a feeling of being outdoors. Very open feeling."}
{"text":"This is such a great new restaurant! Good happy hour deals and delicious food and drinks. Everything we tried was wonderful :) I had their Paloma Margarita, which had Squirt in it; I've never had that in a margarita and it was so good! We also tried the nachos, several different tacos and churros for dessert. They serve the churros with a warm chocolate sauce, it was amazing. I've never been a big churro person but I'll want to get those every time!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing, the pork belly taco was the best thing,  I will definitely come back and advise u if you haven't came here drop what your doing and get over here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Shredded beef tacos were like biting down on plastic shoelaces. Sorry guys, it just plane sucked."}
{"text":"So we decided to try this place with mixed reviews,   Boy o boy am I glad we did, starting with the warm welcome we received. After sitting and they explained how to order, sushi menu style. After having appetizers of chicken chicharrón and loving it. I had some nachos and they were definitely worth it. I also put down lengua and cheese tacos. After all of this we had the churros. Your bill come in a bar tender how to book. How kool is that! Yes I recommend this taco joint with thumbs up"}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot. Great drinks \"Old Fashions \" thought they were a drink from a time long, long ago. I asked for Southern Comfort Old Fashion, the bartender was kind enough to bring me into the year 2017. \"Um- we don't even carry Southern Comfort\" he politely said quietly.   I was a little confused by the selections of that kind of drink but he suggested a Tequila Old Fashion, he said it was very good. So I went for it. EXCELLENT! It kind of reminded me of a Scotch Old Fashion. Very yummy.   The bartender offered a touch of the tequila in a glass as a sample and showed me the brand they use. He told me how the tequila was aged in whiskey barrels, and that, that's what gave it a smoky flavor.   My partner and I ordered chips and salsa. We got hot and mild all were very good with lots of flavor.  We also ordered 4 tacos of various flavors, they were really good too.  Overall I like this new place very much, would give 5 Stars, but I'm not sure I can afford to keep going there. The final bill for 4 drinks, chips & salsa and 4 tacos was $77.68 with tip  Yikes. I actually wish I could have tipped more appropriately but I did what I could.  Can you guys add a happy Hour to your menu? Price is what's keeping me from coming back more."}
{"text":"Went with my roomate and my boyfriend to this new taco spot. It was happy hour, but it wasn't too packed. We ordered nachos that were good to split between three and all ordered an arrangement of different tacos. The carnitas and pollo agave taco were the best in my opinion of the ones we tried. The price was reasonable and we all left satisfied! I would suggest trying for yourself!"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was great!! Jordyn was our server, and she was amazing. Highly recommend this place. Happy hour all day on Mondays!"}
{"text":"First time here. The fried Brussel sprouts were amazing as were the different tacos  Ryan gave us really good recommendations on what to try!"}
{"text":"This was our third time here and it was a slow Thursday night.  We could not get a table at three different restaurants in the neighborhood, but walked into an almost empty dining room here.  The Four Roses Bourbon mule was underwhelming: no fizz to ginger beer and no mint. Waitress admitted drinks were premixed in batches-yuck. We had no silverware.  Our food was deposited and waitress walked off without noticing our lack of silverware.  The tacos were not piping hot, which was surprising given their lack of business.  My husband enjoyed his mushroom taco, which he had never tried.  Overall, the mediocre service and food and lack of attention to detail means we will not be back.  When all the restaurants up and down 40th are packed and overflowing, and yours is not, you better figure it out and soon."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos (omg try the lamb), fantastic service, and great atmosphere! Pickle, the bartender, and Tim, the manager, went out of their way to make sure our visit was outstanding. I will most definitely be back - often. One my new favorites!"}
{"text":"So this is a story - I was going to rate this a 5+; however it quickly turned from one shift to another quickly in one day.  I will tell you, the tacos are the best I've had in town, seriously no doubt---unique, fresh, keeps you ordering more!  Matter of fact all the food is great.  I came in earlier in the day on a Friday before the busy time started and dropped over $120 only due to continuously really sampling everything.  We had a great server by he name of Mickey that was kind, customer service oriented, and extremely accomodating.  We live walking distance and I fell in love with this place along with my kids and a neighborhood friend.  At this time, 5+ stars!  Already recommended a handful of friends and neighbors that were curious as they hadn't been yet.  I quickly met my hubby there to eat dinner and we set at the bar.  He ordered three tacos and everything was still very good, however the customer service from a young, smart-alec millennial that had poor customer service and treated us as we should be lucky enough for him to take our order turned the entire experience and star rating!    I saw the bar manager that had come up with the most amazing margarita for me and asked him to get her to tell him what she did, well he messed it up and was extremely rude about having to remake it and brought back disgusting drinks that we paid for and left sitting at the bar.  I was appalled and wanted to share with the owner the experience just with this one employee that will deter customers from coming back or coming at all.  Food can be the best, but when you have a bad apple like this, you'll spoil your business.  I shared briefly what an a** this kid was to the bar manager and left.  It's a shame.  This was our first experience and the ending was horrific.    The first experience was awesome, but upon return after bragging, it was disappointment and embarrassing. We went out today and shared we would have gone here again, but due to the idiot at the bar, we didn't eat lunch here and tried another new amazing place down the street - \"Helio Basin\" that has unique food, great service and staff and to my understanding, the owner comes to regularly.    Now I've shared this bad experience with more than I recommended.  When I asked the jerks name at the bar, he quickly made up a name and said his name was \"Pickle.\"  Either that's a lie or perhaps that's the reason he's an a$$ due to the issues he's gone through.    Recommend to go and stay away from the bar but would hesitate if this behavior is tolerated to guests that is supporting local owners and contributing to paying the staff's wages."}
{"text":"Tacos Tequila Whiskey is an award winning Denver Based restaurant group with one location in Phoenix. They feature breakfast tacos, street sized non-traditional tacos and small batch Tequila and Whiskey based Drinks. They also are a Top 50 Best New Restaurants in the Country according to Bon Appetit Magizine.  This is a small full service restaurant with a dog friendly patio. From the entrance it's easy to pass by because they lack a large sign and it looks sort of like a garage. Inside it also looks like you order at a counter but then you see there is no counter so you seat yourself. You order using a dry erase marker. It is suggested that you might want 3-5 tacos depending on your appetite.  We started out by sharing the Watermelon and Arugula Salad. This was my favorite plate of what I tried. The salad was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS...I loved this salad.  I feel very mixed about the tacos. Some were better than others. I LOVED the Mushroom Taco I tried at Tacolandia. It was among the BEST I tried at that festival. The BEST ONE I tried today was the Beer Battered Fish Taco. I received a double shelled over stuffed taco. It was very difficult to eat. The small size tortillas just can't wrap around the fillings and it was like King Kong trying to squeeze into a Barbie Dress.....It just couldn't be done but the taco was delicious and tasty. The batter had a great flavor and the fish was mild and meaty. The Fish Taco was most successful and delicious of the tacos I tried today.  My least favorite Taco was the Pollio Agave. This taco had great potential because the chicken was tender and good with a super great crust. But this taco was all sweet....and the chimichurri didn't have enough punch to round things out. What made it even less successful was that all the agave soaked into the tortillas making them mushy and wet. It made them even seem raw.  My husband tried all the tacos. He enjoyed the Pork Belly the most...and maybe the Fish taco next.  Service was friendly and various workers checked on us.  Three stars is overall a positive review on Yelp (3 stars = A-OK) I just have some reservations."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour the other day. The atmosphere is cool, and casual but very clean and fresh at the same time. They have a patio that looks amazing but it was wayyy too hot for that.  We ordered the house margerita, it was pretty good. The only thing I didn't like was the salt that they used on the rim, it seemed like it was just table salt.   My boyfriend got the limeaid soda, he liked it but it was too key lime tasting to me, very sour.   We ordered the nachos and slider combo.  The chips are made in house and have a great crunch and flavour, everything that they topped the nachos with was great too. They weren't really heaping nachos, but everything on there tasted good. We ended up ordering another plate!  The sliders were all pretty nice. The buns were sweet and fresh and the sauces went really well with the burgers. My personal favourite was the beef dip. The jus that they serve with it was heavenly. To warn you the chorizo sloppy Joe is a bit spicy, but still good. The shrimp one had a perfect fry on it and was tasty.  I was a little disappointed that none of the tacos were on their happy hour menu, but I want to come back here again and try some other stuff!"}
{"text":"Ah-may-zing. Tacos.   Totally worth the visit if you're looking for good eats. The ordering style is a little odd and takes away from the experience a bit (Seriously, guys, just have your servers take the orders. What is this marking your own menu nonsense?)  Nonetheless, the food we definitely the shining star of the experience. Very good. Will be back for sure when I'm looking to grub on amazing food."}
{"text":"Wait time is ridiculous for food and it was just bad customer service. They really didn't acknowledge us or apologize for the wait until we asked for our food."}
{"text":"Oh goodness. This place is terrible. They are the definition of trying too hard. All the meat was flavorless and the prices are pretty high for tacos. There are so many other options new by. Don't waste your money. I was a little annoyed too by the decor. The service was nice and attentive. My review is based merely off the food. We tried the fries appetizer that had chorizo on it. No flavor. And was served cold. We tried 5 different tacos and they were al bad. I'm not sure why this place has 4 stars."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to trying this place since the sign popped up a few months ago. Tacos Tequila Whiskey does not disappoint.  The tacos are on the expensive side, but the meat is cooked perfectly, the sauces aren't overwhelming and the toppings are on point.   The menu is set up similar to a sushi restaurant where you use a dry erase marker to choose what you want to order. We got carne asada, carnitas, pollo a la crema and barbacoa to get a nice sampling. The tacos are double wrapped to keep the juicy meats together and the sauces served on the side match perfectly with each taco.  Let's talk drinks! It's impossible to go to a place called Tacos Tequila Whiskey and leave without trying a cocktail or two. I tried their unique take on a Moscow Mule. The drink substituted vodka for tequila and included some cucumber and chili flavors. Very good!  We also tried the chips and guacamole, which were good, but not the best I've had. Plus we ended our meal with an order of sweet and crunchy churros with chocolate sauce.  Overall Tacos Tequila Whiskey is a great addition to the Arcadia neighborhood. Food and drinks are great and the atmosphere is trendy and cool. I recommend giving it a shot!"}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour and had such a great time that I spent most of my evening here. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. Great happy hour offers. food came out in a very timely manor. Also, They have multiple TVs and were playing sports. It was a fun and chill vibe."}
{"text":"Great happy hour & fun neighborhood place. Loved the queso, Guac & all the fun tacos. Def returning!"}
{"text":"Great tacos, margaritas, beer selection (some local, yay!) and service. However, a bit crammed and loud. Will likely be back, perhaps just during the day instead."}
{"text":"I liked this place. I went for the first time with my mom and we had a really good time. The chips and gauc were good, and the tacos were as well. The service was excellent, we sat at the bar. I didn't get her name, but the bartender was very nice and provided great service. I say good job! I recommend this place if you like street tacos (who doesn't?) and/or Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and the food has been great, servers were pleasant and the atmosphere is hip. A definite go-to!"}
{"text":"In town for work from Denver (where the OG restaurants are) and had to come by to check out the new location. It did not disappoint. Kayla, who was the manager on staff, came and greeted me. She took the time to point of some of the new tacos to the Phoenix location. As always, the queso was delicious, the tacos divine, and the service prompt (Derek took excellent care of me). To all you Phoenix natives looking for a funky, tasty, and down-to-earth place to relax, stop by for a Marg and some truly unique tacos. Salud!"}
{"text":"First and last visit.  Clean environment but the food is mediocre at that.  Small tacos, look pretty but the taste isn't there."}
{"text":"This is great new place. The outdoor seating and sliding barn doors that open up the western most side of the restaurant give it this incredible open air feeling.  The tacos FN rock! I've been too many taco joints and these kick ass! Through October on weekends from 11pm to 3pm Bloody Mary's, Maria's and Mimosas are only one penny!  The staff here are cordial and very efficient. They just opened in May and the establishment is immaculate.  Come out and support this new comer. They are well worth supporting and making a staple in the community. I wish them all the luck and Twyla and I will be by often to lend our support!  #Vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate #irishcatv2"}
{"text":"The location is great....in that area of Arcadia/Phoenix that his booming with housing and restaurant progress. The patio is shaded and listed and is dog friendly. There is an area with 4 tops and another area with larger party tables although you can sit anywhere you like. The bar is dual facing, so you can look out or in. I've been there twice for happy hour. Their HH drink menu is a splendid deal and there are plenty of cocktail options. I loved the Paloma Pinche as well as their margarita. Both hit that sweet spot of not too sour, not too sweet. They are not shy with the alcohol! We only had the shrimp slider on the HH menu. Two pieces of fried shrimp in a sweet sauce on challa roll. Best non burger slider I've ever had. Their taco menu is extensive. There are so many options and even several vegetarian AND vegan items. They are street tacos so their small but the chefs pack in the flavors with sauces, cheeses, and spices to make each taco we had delicious. We tried all the fish and veggie tacos and were not disappointed with ANY of them. Roughly 3-4 bucks per taco. Service at the bar was on point, always checking on us but not overbearing."}
{"text":"The Queso Fundido con Chorizo is excellent! The best Queso Fundido hands down! Choose to do shrimp & scallop tacos. Tasted good just wish they had more salsa options to pair with the tacos. Still like this spot a lot for happy hour all day Monday."}
{"text":"Cool people. Cheap drinks. My buddy works right next to here at even Stevens and so we come here to get a drink when I pick him up! Awesome place and love the inside/outside bar!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night at 830 PM. Sat in the bar area, two of us, was greeted pretty quickly and we ordered right away. We ordered the guacamole first, which tasted like plain avocado, no flavor and zero spice. We asked for some salsa to possibly add a little flavor to it- our server responded with, \"it's probably going to take a while\". Call me crazy, but I think that a request for salsa should be pretty common in a place that serves tacos?!  Empty on chips, water and still no food. Then we get our salsa as we continue to wait for 40 minutes... We then got ONE chicken taco, which was cold and the server said it's because it has kale and pico de gallo in it?! That was it. No offer to another option.  We are watching the entire staff run around looking so unorganized and frantic. All the servers are standing by the kitchen waiting and the kitchen staff- they make Chipotle look like a Michelin-starred restaurant compared to the mess we watched. Our server avoided us, no food, no water... We gave up and asked for our bill. She dropped it off with zero sympathy and ''said sorry for the wait''.  Will not be back and based on the service we had, they aren't worried about it."}
{"text":"YUMM! I don't like Mexican restaurants, because I'm Mexican! Lol! They're usually too greasy, and I always walk away disappointed, feeling sick, and regretting not going elsewhere. BUT , this funky taco joint is my favorite-and my son's also! They're reasonably priced, and you can order different varieties-so many to choose from! We usually order a round of little tacos, they serve them on a large platter so we can share them. They're pretty authentic, with a little modern twist, and they're not at all greasy and gross. My favorite is the vegetarian taco. It's so flavorful! If you want a little taste of Mexico (and very close to my mama's cooking-minus the modern part!) this is the place to go. I've not had any adult beverages there yet, but it does have a pretty happening happy hour, a very cool outside patio area, and the decor is funky, Mexican inspired, and modern. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good and spicy food that you can pair with some good drinks. Music too loud though making it slightly uncomfortable to talk"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood & visit this place nearly every week!  We also bring visitors here on every occasion we can!  Love the menu and the variety.  As someone who is gluten free I love that they not only have a bunch of options - but they are clearly labeled on the menu!  The husband and I usually get the salsa trio (molcajete, roasted tomatillo & Devil sauce) - a few house margaritas and 2-3 tacos each!    Service is always quick and friendly & we've never had a bad meal.  Love that they always have a few specials as well!  The old school rap that usually plays on Friday/ Saturday nights cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"I came here and ate in with my family a few weeks ago and had a pretty decent experience; really loved the grilled vegetable kale salad! Cut to tonight when I ordered the kale salad to-go and found out their takeout process is a disaster. The teenager on the phone was very confused by my order (grilled vegetable salad, no cheese). She said 10-15 min and I arrived then and watched them start my order as I walked in. After waiting 25 min, I was given my salad and took it home to find it was missing the dressing, the corn, the pumpkin seeds and the raisins. It was literally just dry kale and avocado with some of the peel still on the pieces. I called and told them just to refund my card, but it was super disappointing because I thought I found my new to-go salad. Guess not."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I thought it was lil' pricey for a taco, but they were awesome! Worth every penny. Go during happy hour, they have specials. I went a little late so there weren't any specials but the tacos and margs were on point."}
{"text":"Love, love love! Moved back to Phoenix from Denver and the minute I knew this place was opening I couldn't contain my excitement. Came In for tacos and even better than we remember. Absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good but could definitely have more selection for vegetarians. The building is great and I love that they have a fairly good variety... Just need more meat free options and then they would be five stars!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food was so delicious it practically put us in a coma. It's great being able to order street tacos and everything else al a cart so you can try everything. We had 4 kinds of tacos, the romaine salad, and chips with guacamole. The fried chicken tacos were the bomb.  Our server Homer was just terrific. My margarita, the Paloma, seemed light on tequila but it was delicious.  The very best thing was the hot churros with chocolate sauce. We've had churros from Mexico to Spain and these were the best hands down.  Yum!"}
{"text":"No carbs, everything is in Spanish, food is no good. They gave us one menu for 5 people, we needed a magnifying glass to read the menu."}
{"text":"Loveit here ,, nice patio ,, best deals : awesome view .. happy hour all day on mondays GREAT DEAL."}
{"text":"I like this place so this is kind of a tough review. Originally gave it 2 stars then upgraded to 3 as a I've been going here fairly regularly and discovered their happy-hour sliders. Probably if I lived in another neighborhood, TTW would get 4 stars  and certainly more from others. Here's why.   There's a fun, indoor/outdoor atmosphere a little reminiscent of the Old Town open air bars, with a trendy latin flavor. Nice patio to chill on a lazy Arcadia weekend or happy hour. Music lends a party atmosphere but the hip club/dj set list wasn't our cup of tea.  Prices reflect the atmosphere although food quality has room for improvement at this tier.   There's a friendly, diverse waitstaff that seems to enjoy what they're doing and wants to take good care of their clientele. That's TTW's best asset. They seemed a little rushed but present enough to answer questions, offer recommendations, and share some laughs. With these personalities I met, I suspect the rushed vibe should work itself out soon as they hit their stride. I'll come back  because it's in my backyard and for the atmosphere / social experience.  We had barbacoa and lamb tacos. Lamb was tasty but oversauced IMO and more messy than I prefer. Sometimes that's fine but this  seemed like they may missed the mark with consistency? The barbacoa was ok but not stand-out. Chicharrones at $4 were the best I've had. These chicken skins were delish and I'll come back for more.  So, it's a tough review and only 2 stars because our neighborhood is blessed with some of the best \"gourmet taco\" joints you're  likely to find anywhere. Competition in this category, in our neighborhood, is tough these days. The tacos I had at TTW's  don't rank with Crujiente or Helio Basin's delightful creations. And, with a number of great street taco joints just down the road for $1 or so a pop, I want my $4-5 tacos to be amazing."}
{"text":"Nice spot for happy hour. Cool art on the walls. The tall tables in the bar area are great for a group and I'm so glad they didn't have the enormous TV's above the bar turned on. The place has such good energy, I'd hate to see that destroyed by some brainless television programming.  The pinche paloma- tequila/grapefruit juice/lime/agave/squirt- is fab- not too sweet, not too sour, love the salted rim! It's an awesome deal during HH ($4) but good enough to order during regular hours ($9).   Fried cabbages- maybe not healthy, but SO good. I love a crispy sprout and these are nicely sprinkled with cotija- not just on top, but all the way through the bowl. The dipping sauce was really tasty, but these bite size veggies were fine on their own, too. $4 for a large serving- definitely recommend.  Queso la plancha taco ($3.25)- Not bad- griddled cotija cheese was good, topped with a bit of guac and a tomatillo salsa that was heavy on the lime. The double wrapped corn tortillas were good, but could've used a minute or two on the grill. Would have been better with a bit of hot sauce.  Overall, good place for HH. The menu is small, but what's on it is good and reasonably priced. Warning- they don't split checks. This is annoying if you are with a group and something I hope they reconsider even if it means adding automatic gratuity for a large table. I despise that moment when you have to figure out who ordered what to split a bill with a group. So much easier if the server does it for us. It's annoying to do and I always worry that the server gets stiffed because someone doesn't pay as much as they should. Would return, but probably not with a group."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited from California and saw the amazing menu for this place. Food was delicious especially queso con chorizo, churros,  and taco de carnitas. Our waiter was really cool and the place played old school hip hop jams (no trap or mumble rap). Highly recommend this place if you in this area and hope they had this type of place in LA."}
{"text":"The tacos are the BEST! Pricey, and wouldn't mind paying for them, but didn't have a happy hour for taco Tuesday! I would love to see that happen."}
{"text":"Our experience was mixed. We tried 5 different tacos, a shrimp slider, and a couple cocktails.   The tacos were all pretty good - the one with the corn was my favorite. The slider was really good and the cocktails were average.  The atmosphere is really cool with the open garage doors as well. If it was just based on the food and atmosphere, I would give a 4 star.  BUT...  If their management doesn't fix some things, I don't think this place will last given the amount of competition in the area as well as the demographic.  We were there around 4:30 on a Saturday and they had 4-5 employees on their day-off in there drinking at the bar top (typically not allowed at good bars). Anyway, it wouldn't have been a big deal, except ALL Focus was on them. All 3 bartenders were more interested in talking with their friends/employees at the bar. The manager even went over and hung out with them for quite some time. All this going on while the rest of the patrons were ignored. Because of this, it gave off more of a young/Old Town Scottsdale feel which I don't think will take off in the location.   On our way out, we heard a group of college kids say, \"Never going back there.\"  I'm not against going back, but since there is great Mexican food and 50 other cool bars/restaurants in the area, I definitely won't be recommending it nor will I be back any time soon. The employees were VERY comfortable given the fact that they just opened."}
{"text":"First off let me say I was excited to eat here but that quickly changed. Amy group of 7 walked in and the first thing that was said to us by our waiter when we sat down was \"Just an FYI, we don't split checks it's policy so yeah.\" Not even a hello, how has your day been was said to us before that. Also, the policy is annoying but not something that we would be upset about if told in a kinder manner. Our group then proceeded to order. The ordering process is very odd and not very smart. You mark how many tacos you want on the menu with a dry erase marker.I saw many orders messed up because it is so easy to erase what one put down. We ordered about 15 tacos and out of those 15, SEVEN never came out. And they also brought out two tacos that we never even ordered AND tried to charge us for them even though we sent them back. Also ordered two margaritas and they were never brought out. Needless to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I had lunch with my meet up group today and this is where we went. I was really disappointed. First off it is very hard to find as they only have one little sign in the back. Then as I am walking towards the building I see a sign stating to please use the front entrance. So I walk around to the front of the building only to find out that there is no entrance in the front of the building so I have to walk all the way back again. I ordered two tacos (and unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of them) and I left hungry. I knew they were street tacos but I figured that for the price they would be a little bigger than normal street tacos. I was wrong. You do not get any chips and salsa and everything extra you want you pay for. I had ordered an iced tea and could not believe that they did not offer sweetener. They offered me some simple syrup however they did not have any artificial sweeteners of any kind. Luckily I had a few in my purse that I could use. We had asked to have separate checks when we first sat down but was told that was not possible. They did say they could split the bill up at the end. When it was time to go they could not split the bill according to what each of us had however. We had to do the math ourselves to tell them how much to put on each of our cards. Seriously??!! You're telling me you just bought a new POS system and it doesn't have that functionality??? Okay. So we give the waitress each of our cards and tell her how much to put on each and she brings them back. Oops she messed up and put his amount on my card and vice versa. Now we have to wait for her to go and correct that so we can be on our way. So needless to say I was very disappointed and feel that although the tacos were good, they were way overpriced for what you get. I feel like I spent way too much money to walk out hungry the way I did."}
{"text":"No Bushmills? I'm confused.   Whiskey-F Tacos- B Drinks- A Atmosphere- B  Just another hip looking start up restaurant with no substance trying to squeeze some cash out of the ever growing new Arcardia crowd.  Probably won't be around too long."}
{"text":"I love, love this place! I been here a total 3 times already. The tacos are street tacos so they are small and comes with two corn tortilla. The price is around four dollars a taco, so kind of pricey. I'm not a big fan of tequila (younger party days), but wow you could hardly taste the tequila. You could taste it but it was smooth. My favorite tacos has to be the pork belly, carnitas, and the shrimp. Get those and you won't be disappointed. Also the bartender Juvier (I believe) is awesome. He's very informative and you can tell he likes his job. The guacamole and chips are good and so is the cheese dip, but you have to eat the cheese fast because it starts to harden. Overall this is my spot when I crave tacos."}
{"text":"What you don't get-  Separate checks \"The bill is Sushi style\"  A table cloth Sound conducive to conversation No serving implement What you get  A table Rock hard chairs Loud echoing noise from the bare floor walls and high ceiling.  One (yes that's 1) napkin A glass for water Water (no ice)  A plate A fork  A \"Sushi Style\" check.  They serve food, but the Spartan atmosphere and lack of service is too much. They are trying to be a trendy eatery and fail.  The fanny fatigue is not worth the food."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The atmosphere.  The food. The drinks. Everyone is amazing.. I always bring my friends here when they visit. It's refreshing for a new place in the area. Happy hour is good. Love the family style experience. If you're looking for a la carte tacos, this is by far the best"}
{"text":"Good tacos, and drinks. Won't get the Michelada that's for sure. Not my cup of tea. Lol Good portions for the food, although I had lengua tacos before and all the junk added to the tacos here made its really nasty!!! 4 stars still. Service was great!!!!"}
{"text":"Great street tacos. Watch out for the vegan taco it was spicy! Staff was friendly and helpful.  The tequila Bloody Mary was spicy with spicy salt on the rim.  Not hard to get to."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was very good to great!  The repolla tiernos (aka fried brussels sprouts) were the best we have ever had; they seemed more charred than fried .  No tough core, tender and delicious.  The arugula watermelon salad was a  hit.  We ordered several tacos.  I really liked the parilla shrimp, while my partner loved the lengua.  The pork belly was good, but i did remove the layer of fat.   The house made spiked soda was really refreshing, good sangria and the beer selection good.   They have many salsa varieties and good guac.   Sign up for their emails, they send some good offers."}
{"text":"Once again, an overpriced hipsteresk  places with kale on their tacos??? Come on now just make a classic taco with the double tortilla. Yea have the updated environment with loud music and a bar but jeezus, make a simple decent taco. Gahhhh"}
{"text":"Popped in last night on a whim. Great experience. Had 4 different kinds of tacos, all delicious, especially the pork belly taco. And a drink called the pinche Paloma. So good:). Definitely will visit again. Love the vibe, high ceilings, good music, super friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  Came in pretty late, greeted with super friendly service and was given tips about the menu and told everyone's favorite tacos.  Ordered about 5 different tacos for my date and I - and really enjoyed every single one of them.   The drinks were also delicious and very affordable. Will definitely make it to this place again and would recommend for others to check it out."}
{"text":"Outstanding!! My new favorite place. Sat at the bar and did the tour of their tacos as well as a flight of tequila and their Old Fashioned is amazing. Even better than Joyride and that is hard to beat. Great prices and great happy hour. I loved that the music was not blaring and could actually have a convo."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place! The name alone got me really excited. However, once I got there and tried the food the food was just OK. Nothing to write home about. But the point that really got to me was when rap music was playing overhead and the N-word kept coming up over and over again in various songs! Being an African-American it's hard for me to except that a place with play music like that that use the N-word. It was completely unacceptable and inappropriate. I also found that the food was way too expensive for what you would normally pay for tacos. I will not be going back! #HighlyOffended"}
{"text":"Terrific new joint in the Arcadia neighborhood. Great service. Brussels Sprouts are out of this world. Awesome pork belly tacos. Do yourself a favor and stop by SOON! Thanks for the great service, Vanessa"}
{"text":"We tried this place because of all the good reviews and were very disappointed.  The tacos were just \"ok\" - they weren't special or anything to rave about.  I've had much better and much cheaper at one the small Mexican food restaurants around town.  The drink menu is very limited and the cocktails were also just \"ok.\"  Went with friends for Happy Hour and as it got later and started to \"fill up\" one of the hostesses kept giving us the stink eye to leave, but we had not received our check from our waitress.  After the hostess was literally staring at us for about 15 minutes with venom in her eyes, we asked her \"could you get our waitress to give us our check and we will gladly leave.\"  So bottom line - food not good and staff just downright RUDE.  Do not recommend - try somewhere else"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere! Open air dining. Great variety of street tacos. I tried the lamb and the fried chicken one. They were both tasty. We had the queso tequila dip with chips. Also unique. Crispy thin chips and cheese served  melted in a small cast iron skillet. Great customer service. When party of our order was accidentally served to another table the manager personally apologized and took that part  off the bill!"}
{"text":"You know some of my friends were so excited to take me here and they weren't open. So my other friends did a few nights later. Talk about dodging a bullet the first time and getting shot the second time. Talk about overpriced, reductive, basic food and drinks. I sat here and drank their \"special\" margarita which surprisingly was the same price as the menu margarita. Ok fine. Then my friend ordered the chicken skins and they were completely burnt. We sent back two different margaritas and then our tacos came. They were the size of a teacup saucer and so heavily dressed that the actual food on them was just a mayo salad on corn bread. Good luck in the future you're gonna end up the usual American business that goes out of business within 10 years. We couldn't even split our bill at the end. Oh and Happy Margarita and Taco Day!"}
{"text":"Our work team wanted to try a new place for lunch. This place is fun, clean and creative.  We were early, so lots of space and warm, friendly service.   The menu is interesting - you mark want you want on a sheet (like sushi) and they bring things out on a platter.  Hard to remember what you ordered but we made it work.    The Brussels sprouts were interesting, but not fabulous. I loved most of their tacos.  Street taco style. Their special Ahi tostado was too hot for us.  The fried cojita cheese tacos were great.  I also loved the pork belly taco.  The others all looked very good.   I know I'm not part of their targeted demographic, so the tall round stools were really uncomfortable for me.  There were a couple of low tables that I will request when coming back.    Also looking forward to coming back after work to try the Whiskey and Tequila!"}
{"text":"So happy this place opened up down the street! Awesome selection of tacos - my favorites are the carnitas, pollo agave, and pork belly. Great drinks and appetizers as well. The Mexican street corn was some of the best I've ever had and the chicken skin chicharrones were delicious. Seriously not a bad item on the menu. Laid back atmosphere and friendly staff round out a perfect addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Grabbed for lunch take out. Meh hipster-style street tacos. Fish taco bland. Pork belly taco bland. Lamb taco pretty good. Probably will not make a point to come back, though."}
{"text":"So glad that we found this place. Had the queso fundido with shishito peppers to start off with and my fiancée had to Snapchat the bubbling sizzling goodness. I had to dive in prior to getting photo or video evidence, sorry. Accompanying that was a delicious Bloody Maria, with the perfect amount of spice. We then ordered an array of tacos, ranging from carne asada, chicken chimichuri, breakfast tacos, to fish tacos. Based on my testing, you cannot order a bad taco here. My favorite was the chicken taco, the fried chicken on it was to die for. Tried the Serrano margarita too which was awesome. Service was very good, everyone was very helpful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Tacos Tequila Whiskey (no commas) boasts on their website that they are ranked as being one of the \"21 Best Mexican Restaurants in America\" and \"10 Best Taco Spots in the US\".  The source? A food blogger on the Huffington Post. And since virtually everything on the Internet these days is written as a \"list,\" I doubt it's a legitimate list that was compiled from anything beyond one person's opinion. But hey, it's still worth bragging about!  TTW is a popular taco joint in Denver that decided, as many places do, that the next logical step would be to open a location in Arizona (I'm assuming the inevitable Texas/Austin location is a work in progress). My girlfriend and I like tacos, especially ones that incorporate a bit of creativity and emphasize quality. But let's be frank, we already have tons of four-dollar taco shops in the surrounding area, so this is nothing new. Furthermore, I don't drink tequila and whiskey, so I can only comment on the food.  I'll give the place credit for operating quite smoothly despite only being open for a few weeks. My girlfriend and I ordered some chips and guac to start, as well as a total of six tacos. These included two asada, two barbacoa, one pork belly, and one carnitas. Additionally, we ordered a side of their fried Brussels sprouts.    Note: The guac is seven dollars, although the online menu claims it's six. Don't tell them that some places charge up to 20 dollars. Shh!  We didn't like the sprouts. They were burnt. And I don't mean that they were coated in a slightly charred shell that enhances flavor. No. They were full-blown burnt - as in every single bite was overpowered by the fact that they were scorched too harshly. I'm not sure if that's how they come or if it was the result of an error. Nevertheless, we struggled to finish them and noted it on their feedback card. We also suggested that perhaps some rice and beans sides would be a nice option, which is something a few other reviews have pointed out as well.  The tacos were kind of meh. The asada was probably the best of the bunch, but still easily comparable to what we've found at some lower-end places. The pork belly, which looked a bit intimidating, wasn't too bad. We both disliked the barbacoa, which seemed to have way too much cloves, resulting in an incredibly harsh and potent flavor that my girlfriend insists was not done correctly. Additionally, for some reason, bits of jalapeno seemed to be lurking around in pretty much everything - which was fine for me, but not for my spice-hating girlfriend. She couldn't pinpoint the issue with the carnitas, which I wasn't in the mood to sample.  Overall, I felt that TTW was kind of a mixed bag - similar to what you'd find at a place like Blanco Tacos down the road. There's nothing particularly great about it, but there's nothing I'd classify as horrendously bad either. It's just your standard ultra-trendy four-dollar taco shop that primarily attracts a post-work/happy hour crowd.  Recommended to try out."}
{"text":"Great food. Great drinks. Great service. Boom. They were out of Cordero but had the asado, shrimp, beef cheeks and lengua. Everything was good but the margarita won the night."}
{"text":"Unprofessional staff cursing and drinking at a table nearby. Seemed offended to have to work - we left before the orders were placed."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows how much I love tacos. So when I saw that there was a new taco joint opening up that was a quick bike ride away, I knew I had to get there ASAP to test out all the taco glory.  Luckily for me, Tacos Tequila Whiskey was delicious and can now be a part of my weekly taco rotation.  Two of the standouts we had were the beef cheek tacos and the lengua taco.  I'm normally not the biggest lengua fan, however the meat really melted in your mouth, so it had more of a brisket type quality when you bit into it, which I loved.  Also, if you go, please do not miss out on the churros!!  The churros con chocolate (made with Abuelita chocolate - which is a cinnamon sugar type of chocolate) were absolutely outstanding.  Hands down the best churros I've eaten in the Valley.  So good in fact, that we came back here for a 2nd time over the weekend so I could get a second helping of it ;)  And considering that this restaurant just opened this weekend, I have to say that our service was outstanding!  We sat in Mary's section, and she was really friendly, knowledgeable, and had great food and drink recommendation (try the Gin N Mousse - it's a prickly pear gin and mezcal drink; to die for!).  I highly recommend sitting in her section; she made the experience even more fun.  A+++ for Tacos Tequila Whiskey!!  I'll definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Loved the chips and salsa, fresh made chips ( we watched them make them) and your choice of three salsas, from mild to flaming! We shared two tacos, plenty for sharing! Great margaritas and draft beer. We will definitely  be back. Happy hour prices til six!"}
{"text":"I write this with the idea that I will give this place hopefully another try. We went to Tacos Tequila Whisky this past Friday to try it out since we live in the area. They had the window open between the bar and restaurant which was a bit silly because it was over 100 degrees outside. I'm all for inside outside dining but people were visibly uncomfortable.   The service needs help. The lady they had bringing out the tacos seemed a bit disinterested in the whole thing. Our server was ok but there seemed to be a general lack of polish with their service.   The food was good. The queso was tasty and the chips were fresh. We had a selection of the tacos which were tasty and filling. There just seems to be something missing when you look at other taco places. I have to say my favorite Tacos are at CruJente. Much better Lengua.   I know they are trying to be cool but their food and service needs to step up a bit if they are going to survive in Arcadia."}
{"text":"Insanely good tacos. I recommend the agave fried chicken and the beef cheek. Chips came out warm/crisp and you get to choose 3 salsas. Waitress was warm and friendly. I told them how much I loved their special taco when I was there (pork butt marinated in milk) and they told me it wouldn't be around next time I visited so they gave me one to go for free. I'll be back soon to try their drinks"}
{"text":"I first went to this place in Denver. At that time it was known as Pinché Tacos. When I found out they opened one in Phoenix, The next day I was at the door waiting for them to open. This place is amazing. They put about 4 oz of delicious meats, from the heavens above, on 2 warm tortillas. The meat is always juicy and warm with a bed of different ingredients places on top. The service is amazing. Every time I wanted them I had to go back to Denver, now I can down the street!"}
{"text":"Pros: Good tacos-I liked the barbacoa and creamed corn.  Cons: Expensive, Ordering process is confusing, service is slow, friend I was with had food allergies and they mixed all our tacos together despite ordering on separate menus."}
{"text":"Great food... if you like to eat with dogs. Great environment... if you like to enjoy with dogs. Clean place... if dogs on your tables, and waitresses and food handlers petting dogs while they serve you is your thing."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch one day last week because someone said they had amazing tacos, which they did, but they also had some of the best salsa I've had in a long time. The waiter was very polite and also very attentive. He quickly gave us refills and was on hand if we needed anything. I will definitely be going back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"This first time I came here I wasn't sure I really liked it. Then I came for Happy Hour (which is more my speed to begin with) and liked it a lot more.   So the first time I came here was more post-HH on a Friday (like 8ish), and even though the place seemed nice & all I got a club-y Scottsdale vibe from it. I don't know why that is really, because when I came for HH on Saturday (like 4ish) it wasn't that way at all. It was much more laid back. There's a real nice patio and a long wrap around bar that's kind of on the patio on one side and inside on the other. This is where I sat with my friend for a couple drinks and nachos.   We each had a couple of \"Pinche Palomas.\" They were a little sweet (which is what I'd expect from an HH cocktail), but tasty & refreshing. The nachos were a good sized portion for HH and they were good, but could have used a little more \"stuff\" (crema, pico, etc...). Again, this was HH so I can't complain since they were like 6 bucks for quite a bit of food.  I really like that Tacos Tequila Whiskey does HH EVERY DAY. Both our bartenders were friendly. I'd come back."}
{"text":"(Following review based on Tacos only)  New Favorite Place.  The approach is here is to order tacos like you would with sushi. It does seem more expensive at first, but it's not that much more honestly.  I was thinking it had to be overrated, but it's not!   I recommend ordering the chips.  You get to pick 3 Salsas with it!  The parking is ample as well.  Well thought restaurant! Good job!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and chips n' salsas. Came here around 7pm on a Wednesday and sat immediately on their patio. The tacos were tasty as were the homemade chips, which came hot. The parking lot was full, but it was easy to drive around the block and grab a spot behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new place, stopped by for Happy Hour. Very trendy little place with an open kitchen, tables, patio, High Tops in the Bar area and a Bar. We chose to sit at the bar where Javier took good care of us.  We stayed with the HH Cocktails and Beer. I had the Pinche Paloma. We ordered the HH Slider Combo (fried shrimp slider, MX roast beef slider and a chorizo sloppy joe slider). We also ordered off the regular menu the Guacamole and 2 of the daily special taco offering which was a Short Rib Taco.  My HH cocktail was fantastic. The HH Slider Combo was very good along with the Short Ribs Tacos. The Guacamole was very OK, nothing special but the chips it came with were really good. We asked for some heat (sliced serranos) which we were charged for at the end ( 50 cents). When we got the bill to be honest the cost of the Taco were very pricey $6 each, WOW street taco sticker shock!  Atmosphere trendy (open loft feel), Service from Javier the bar tender fantastic, Food good but very pricey. I'll be back but only for Happy Hour items."}
{"text":"Came here for cocktail boot camp. Place was cute and reminded me of an upscale chipotle with a full bar. We got complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole which was very good. Unfortunately they didn't have any small plates for sharing and we all had to dip in community bowls of salsa and guac, which made the group of strangers I was with a bit uncomfortable. They should really invest in some smaller plates for the appetizers. If I was in the area again I'd come back to try their tacos."}
{"text":"Really loud inside but busy. The guacamole is fabulous and everything else was ok. Waitress was friendly and efficient but they forgot a meal due to ordering process of laminated menus and dry erase markers. They bring the bill out in a coloring book which left us 6 adults confused."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The tacos are always loaded up and they give you two tortillas for each so I always split them up into two tacos.   Javier is an amazing bartender! Always on top of it and has a smile on his face.   Great beer selection and obviously a great tequila and whiskey selection."}
{"text":"Tacos were good, but a little pricey for the quality/size. They are still working on the service, but optimistic they are just opening glitches. Server did not explain process not menu and beers were not the ones we ordered. Water was served warm and we had to ask for ice.  Had a large table and orders were not grouped by couple (order form) so they tacos were spread out all over the table. Will try again in a few weeks to see if they ironed things out."}
{"text":"Great tacos, atmosphere a bit stale.  Tried chef special and the tuna was too spicy and a bit difficult to eat.  I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Don't plan on being served here if you are gay or with a gay couple. They just refused my sober friend service after he politely asked for a drink and said he can have water. Unbelievable"}
{"text":"I am not one to jump to suggesting tacos for dinner but I was so impressed by the tacos at this place. I tend to order vegetarian or Vegan and had the shrimp, mushroom and vegan tacos. The shrimp had a great kick, the mushroom was very rich (almost sweet) and the vegan added variety with the beans and avocado. The mushroom was my favorite. He had the fish (his favorite), the pork belly and the cow tongue. You have to check this place out, it has nice service, cute surroundings, delicious and creative food and healthy options!"}
{"text":"We were the only people in here at 12:15pm on a weekday. Waited well over 20 minutes for 4 tacos. Not the best place to come when hungry. One person working the open kitchen with servers and hostess just standing around waiting for food. I think communication in the restaurant business is so important. If these items were going to take awhile, or they noticed we were waiting this long, a simple - it'll be up shortly, or can I offer you something while you're waiting - would suffice.  I also had an empty water glass for 10 of those minutes.  Lunch special pricing would be helpful, given the price of tacos & side dishes is pretty high. I was also unmotivated to get a drink with no specials. I would recommend the managers train the staff to say \"but our happy hour starts at...\" I left not knowing what if any happy hour there is, as it wasn't posted or mentioned. Also - no black beans!"}
{"text":"Do you love tacos & tequila ?? Who doesn't really :) this place has a fun relaxed vibe.. if you're solo you can grab a seat at the bar .. or sit on the outside pet friendly patio if you're with friends!!  Staff here is always friendly and explain the ordering process whether it's your first time or not..  The taco menu is delish.. on today's visit I had the shrimp, mushroom & lengua tacos.. weird but the mushroom taco was my fav today .. flavors were amazing .   Hongos taco had three kinds of mushroom & roasted corn for that pop of sweet roasted flavor.. paired with an ancho chili cream.. you will love this one!!  The grilled shrimp taco (Camaron a la Parilla) had plenty of good sized shrimp paired with a pineapple guacamole sauce .. sweet and savory goodness..   Finally the lengua taco.. tender chunks of meat with the honey guajillo Mayo .. yum ..   I've never had a meal I enjoy at this place .. and of course you wash it down with a pinche Paloma .. grapefruit, lime, agave nectar, salted rim.. yes please!! Javi at the bar was great !! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This plave is amazing! Being from California I love tacos and cant find a spot out here in Arizona! Super flavorful and the prices arent very expensive. Drinks are bomb too. If you go in ask for Jordan. Such a great waitress with an awesome prersonality. Will be coming back soon! GIVE JORDAN A RAISE!"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience - service was slow, drinks awful, and food was a mix lot. Too bad!  Our server was really sweet and awesome but couldn't make up for the overall issues."}
{"text":"Well, I wish I could rave like some other reviewers, but I cannot.  I dunno why, I guess different tastes.  The prices are high, the tacos are just okay and the tequila....well, I had two tequila drinks (hot margarita), and I didn't taste much tequila.  The slice of Serrano was nice, I fished it out and chopped it up to add to my otherwise bland tacos.  We started with said drinks, wife had a Paloma, FSIL had a Tequila Old Fashioned, and I had the Hot Margarita. Others just went with water.  We ordered some chips with queso fundido to wash them down.  The chips were fresh and tasty, and the queso was sizzling and savory, but the quantity was hardly enough for five people.  Probably better suited to two, three at the most.  There is no salsa, no hot sauce and no condiments.  The fried Brussels Sprouts were enjoyed by the vegetarians, and they said it was okay.  Tacos are on the pricey side, nearing $4 for one tiny street taco.  We had the Queso a la Plancha, Pescado, Pollo Agave and Barbacoa.  Daughter said the la Plancha was pretty good.  Wife liked the Pescado.  I had Pollo Agave and Barbacoa.  The chicken in the Pollo Agave was a fist of deep fried chicken fat.  Nice crispy breading, but the fattiness combined with the sweet of Agave was off-putting.  The menu described a chimichurri, but all I could taste was sugar.  The Barbacoa was again a golfball-sized hunk of meat.  It was mildly flavored and okay.  I think it would have been better if the meat were shredded a bit more.  All in all, nine tacos, two appetizers, two rounds of drinks came in at nearly $200 with a tip.  The tacos were just okay.  The drinks were just okay.  I\"m not sure I'd be interested in going back, it just doesn't dazzle enough for me."}
{"text":"Good food. Happy hour specials were perfect for me and my girlfriends. Service was alright, but it was a Saturday night. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tried this new place in our neighborhood for Friday night dinner with the hubby and this place came up for a place with street tacos! The building is beautiful with barn woods and metal details, but most seating is high top tables (both inside and on the patio) and the barstools are small in diameter, hard wood and very uncomfortable - particularly for those with junk in our trunk! The tacos had ample filling and were well executed but for $4 per taco I felt the value for money was low. We got carne asada (which had overpowering lime flavor), carnitas (was good), barbacoa (my favorite), fish (very under seasoned) and quesp de plancha ( the surprising winner of the night). After 8 tacos, 2 drinks and chips with guacamole we spent over $60. For that price I would have expected better finishing touches like super comfy surroundings, excellent service and freebies at the table like chips and salsa to start. This place is trying to be two different things - both the local hangout and a super trendy \"sushi-esque\" hip place. Not sure if we will be back..."}
{"text":"Service: this guy could have cared less about literally anything. To say thanks for bringing us things is all I got. Margaritas were great I'll give them that. Dont order a salad, it comes out hot. In what world is hot lettuce good?!?"}
{"text":"It was delicious! My fiancé and I have been looking for a taco place near us, and we are happy that we found it. The service was good and the food was very delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love tacos, I really love tacos. I always try an find the best tacos when I am in a new city for a long stay. Here in Phoenix I have found some good places to get tacos, a few better places, and then I found Tacos Tequila Whiskey, and I loved it.  I have been multiple times since my first encounter, and will continue to come back anytime I'm in the area.  The selection of tacos is great, they have a cold beer and a good drink selection.  Even more importantly, the service has been great each time I've been. Whether it was for a lunch break, dinner, or a big group, they are always attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"I'm from Denver and I knew about this place because they started out as a food truck. I loved their tacos then and now they've expanded into a few restaurants.  The food is just as good (lots of vegetarian tacos), but prices are a bit steep. $40 for tacos for 2 people and no drinks is crazy, therefore the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Everyone has been talking about this spot and quite frankly it goes! Staff is extremely nice and welcoming and the ingredients are fresh and delicious. Definitely would recommend to a friend and come back !"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos!!!!! Salsa is amazing. Get the tequila queso. Music is fun. Patio is great and so cozy.  Definitely recommend coming here.  the fried chicken taco is great by the way."}
{"text":"A fellow Yelper suggested I try this place. I was not disappointed. It has that rustic Mexican restaurant that leveled up kinda feel. And I loved their twist on their dishes. Of course I got tacos. I mean, is their anything else better than a good taco. The answer is NO! And this place, got the memo, cause their tacos were Delish.    I typically don't go for the signature drinks when drinking adult beverages, but decided to try my luck, and lucky I was. In fact I tried my friends drink and was surprised how good it was.  So let's recap, great food, great drinks, great atmosphere, that's a win all around. I mean a place with such a title, I wouldn't expect anything less."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to sit at the bar and watch a game (they have PAC 12 network). My 4 star review applies to sitting at the bar only, in the restaurant I would say 3.65 stars. The bar tender, Mr. Redding is on top of his game and has a vast knowledge of Tequilas, Whiskey, and Mezcal (even though I can't get him to like it). The level of service and quality of libations increases at the bar. Regarding the food, the chicharrones are a must try - you may want to bike, or walk here to work off the amazingly delicious and greasy calories (the parking is also limited)! The queso fundido con chorizo is also a super yummy dieters choice. The Brussels sprouts do not disappoint. Fav tacos are the pescado and the hongos! They also have great fresh salsas."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER : This restaurant lives up to it's name. If you're looking for anything more than tacos, apps, and drinks, look elsewhere.   However, this place deserves it's five stars!!! Love the aesthetic here. Place is smaller than expected but feels pretty big! Came on a 60 degree night and the patio with the heaters was even more comfortable and warmer than sitting inside. All of the staff was incredibly accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu items. The sushi-style ordering is a little odd, but we could definitely look past it.  We started off with the salsa and chips (got to choose our three salsas to come with it!!) and queso dip (a MUST try if you come here). The street tacos are incredibly flavorful and incredibly filling. There was not a single taco we received that we didn't like. We probably ordered 4/5 a piece but were too stuffed to get to the last of them by the time we were done with the apps.  Didn't get to try dessert but we definitely be back for more.   Faves of the evening: Monday Evening Happy hour - all night. What's there not to like?  Queso dip - this is not your velveeta queso dip. THANK GOD.  Agave chicken tacos - The Best mix of spices and a little sweetness.  Mexican coke - served in a large coke bottle. Delightful. Pinched Paloma - citrusy marg drink that's not too overwhelming."}
{"text":"Came here on a friday afternoon. Nice place. The bartender Javier was a cool dude easy to talk to. Made some good recommendations. The tacos were good nothing bad to say. Will come again."}
{"text":"The only hot sauce they have is Tabasco out of a 2 gallon kitchen container.  Love the Modelo."}
{"text":"Worst experience I ever had in my life ! Poor service from a girl named Ryan , the whole crew here made me and my family Unwelcomed , Ryan did not make sure we were ok or offer drinks or offer condiments, the whole team was just staring at us , which made it very uncomfortable for me and my family and we felt unwelcomed  them . When we left they all gathered around and watched us leave , I will never come back here again , if I could give less then a star I would !"}
{"text":"Party of 6,  I arrived first. I asked my nice server right off the bat to put me on a separate bill. I don't think it's fair that other people pay for others, if they're not eating/drinking equally. She stated she couldn't and that everyone has to just equally pay. I was perturbed but let it go. Overall, great location, ambiance is fun. Server(s) were attentive otherwise. I overheard my friend tell our server that they should have stated upon arrival about the check situation. Obviously upset, the server said \"I'll just split your check\" to make her happy.  Being that we both worked in the food & beverage industry, don't we all know, as servers, you try your best to be cordial w/out being snappy or challenge a customer?  Still, I really enjoyed the trio of sliders, the nachos and queso dip, all on the happy hour menu.  Despite portions not being generous, it was all very tasty."}
{"text":"I went to this place with high hopes, and being Arizona's Restaurant Week, I figured it was a great opportunity to try it out.  First of all, we got there with a group of 4 of us, and there was a 20 minute wait, which is fine, they were busy. We went to the bar, and the hostess reassured us she would come get us as soon as they had a table for us. 30 minutes passed, and no one had called us. The bartender actually is the one that was like, \"you guys have been waiting for a long time, huh?\", and he went to check w/ the hostess. Turns out, she had passed us for a table. That was annoying.   Anyways, we were finally moved to a table, the waiter came out, got our orders. We ordered to orders of queso fundido to start off, and some cocktails. The drinks came soon, but honestly, they were not very flavorful. My friend got a \"michelada\", which actually tasted like a bloody mary made w/ beer; it wasn't good. Finally, we received one order of the two queso fundidos. We all shared it since we saw the other one hadn't arrived. The 2nd order of queso fundido came way after we had already finished the first one.  After waiting for a while (which is fine, they were pretty busy), we got our tacos, we each tried 3 tacos each. The carne asada was bland. The chicken was all breading with no flavor. The pork belly was my \"favorite\". There were NO salsas w/ the tacos, which was very strange since tacos go hand in hand with a variety of salsa.  We finally got to dessert, we ordered tres leches cake, and churros. Jesus Christ, I was sad! The tres leches cake had a weird texture, it didn't feel soft and moist like tres leches usually feels, plus it was also bland, it didn't even taste sweet. Now, the churros...what a disappointment. They felt uncooked, and too bready. Very weird. The only good thing was the hot chocolate dipping sauce, it was like concentrated chocolate abuelita.   The place is pricey, we just got a good deal because of AZ's restaurant week, but I will most likely not be back. The place is lost in wanting to be \"trendy\", but they forgot about the flavors. Just go to La Santisima."}
{"text":"Besides having the best name ever, Tacos Tequila and Whiskey's layout is actually pretty cool with a large Frida painting and ample outdoor seating. We reviewed the extensive menu and ordered five different tacos, pinche papas (sloppy Joe fries), a Paloma and a Michelada. Our drinks came out first and we both loved them, a great balance of spirits and craft. Maybe I don't go to enough bars, but I've never seen Michelada on the menu, and appreciated the fact that they make it here. When our pinch papas came out, it was hard not to experience emotions of pure glee. Yep, glee. I haven't had pizza fries in a while, and while this wasn't exactly pizza fries, it was reminiscent of it as this was a sloppy Joe version, heaped with lots of cheese. If you're a cheese lover, you will enjoy them as the cheese was so stringy - that's when you know it's GOOD cheese.  Finally, the stars of the show, the tacos, came out. Every single one tasted great as the meat tacos were all cooked perfectly. I would say that the Pork Belly \"Agridulce\" and the Hongos was my favorite. The pork belly was cooked perfectly and though the Hongos was a vegetarian taco, the combination of ingredients was Mexican corn (that cojita cheese and corn) meets shitaki mushrooms. Corn, great. Mushrooms, great. Both together in a taco? I'm down. Overall, I'm glad this Denver based restaurant has come out to Phoenix. Although it only just opened, I know we'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"Drinks and food was delicious, just remember what you order because all the tacos come one round dish."}
{"text":"Tacos tequila whiskey, is amazing! I visited Arizona while on a business trip from Denver. I was thrilled to see this restaurant because the one in Denver is always busy and one of my favorites to boot!  Several of the tacos on the menu if not all, were the exact same and the restaurant was not crowded or too busy. It was like a taste of home. They have wonderful homemade alcoholic sodas on happy hour and a margarita that tops all margaritas in my opinion.  Arizona does not have a lot of the same Mexican food as Denver, so I think that people in Phoenix have a real gem."}
{"text":"We went on a Sat night for Happy Hour (3-6pm). Sat on the patio. We were getting quite wet from the misters, so when the food came they moved us inside. (Their suggestion). I think the best thing about this place was the super friendly service. They had enough staff and wanted to make sure everyone had a good experience. We ordered a slider combo ($6). They were very tasty, but very much on the tiny side. We also got the Brussels Sprouts ($4). They were extremely tasty with The aioli sauce! We were a bit disappointed that only one beer was on the happy hour menu. We had the Pinche Pomelo cocktail and it was really good. It would be nice to see a few less expensive drinks during happy hour. Was happy they were upfront with us when we asked the meaning of \"pinche\" (which we had already looked up). We will definitely be back. Had a really nice vibe."}
{"text":"Cool spot, the bartender, James, was very friendly and attentive. We had the tequila queso with poblanos and corn. I can't remember the term he used for it, adding the poblanos and corn, but it's really good! I ordered 5 tacos, and had around half of each. There is a lot of meat on them. I'd say 3 tacos is probably enough for most people. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at Tacos Tequila Whisky. Louis B. The bartender did a great job recommending the best food and drinks that paired well. We got the nachos, chicharrones, and tacos. For drinks I ordered the pinche soda and a mule. We enjoyed everything and will definitely be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"BIG fan of this place! It was super crazy on a Friday night when we went, so you can't really blame the servers or bartenders for relatively slow service. The food definitely makes up for it though. There was a really awesome special that allowed my boyfriend and I to eat our meal, dessert, and enjoy drinks for under $40. Awesome food, cool atmosphere, pretty great service."}
{"text":"I have frequented this restaurant since it opened and it is up there with Bario Queen as my favorite taco place to go to. I have brought my kid in a few times and he's a normal 2 year that likes to play around and the management has never had an issue with us. Ken B obviously needs to be a better parent and actually watch his children, and also watch the attitude with management. The restaurant is kid friendly as long as you watch your child which Ken B obviously wasn't doing. Thank you for giving the world more kids that are raised by television and iPhones. Oh, get the guava fried chicken taco, it is amazing!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last night for the first time and had the brussel sprouts and several different tacos. The brussel sprouts were AMAZING, so crispy and had such a good flavor, and for $4, who can beat that?! I thought the tacos were good but not great, but I am also a vegetarian, and really good vegetarian food is hard to find. I did cheat and try one of my boyfriends fish tacos, and I thought that was the best out of all of them! He liked his tacos more than I liked mine (so I'm sure if you eat meat you will love it). The tacos are only $3.50 eat which is super reasonable! Overall, it was a good experience and worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has some seriously good queso.....I for real wanted to lick the cast iron skillet. I also tried many tacos which were all decent, but not amazing. The prices are fairly standard for a 'fancy' taco place (3-4$ ish per taco) and each taco had a decent amount of filling (and two tortillas so technically you could make two tacos if you wanted). I'd try them again."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The tacos are full and not puny. The drinks are great.   I don't recommend coming here with more than 4 people though. The tacos are ordered like a sushi menu and brought out all on one plate. It's too time consuming to figure out who ordered what tacos and divvy them up. They also don't do split checks, so any more than 4 people and it's going to get complicated. I personally think the system is kind of weird and serves no purpose, but I love the food so I deal with it. It's the only reason I don't give 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had three different tacos and they were all great. My favorite was Barbosa (I don't remember what the other two were called hehe). So good!"}
{"text":"My first visit here right after they opened wasn't my favorite.  But I'm SO glad we went back.  Had an amazing time with Pickle the bartender. Food was superb. Drinks were cold and refreshing.  I highly recommend their HH offerings. And just go ahead and try every single taco."}
{"text":"Tacos are ok, not great. The service person was helpful, but the main reason this place gets one stare is the way we were treated by the manager. Three of four plates eventually came to the table but not all at once; in piecemeal fashion. As I waited for my food order to come, my family ate their food. After a while, I finally asked the waitress where was my food. She did not know and I told her that i was not happy and would like a word with the manager. When he arrived I told him I was not happy that i had to wait so long for the food and that he should know about it. He barely acknowledge my feelings and never said that he was sorry for the inconvenience, then he left with no apology. The food arrived shortly thereafter. It was quite irritating to all of us his total lack of caring and insensitivity that we were upset. All he needed  say something civil like, \"Sir, I apologize for the problem. Will get on it. What can I do to make things right for you?\" I went up to him when we left and said, \"I'm not happy with the way we were treated today.\" He looked at me with indifference and said to me.... \"I know, Have a nice day\". That was IT!"}
{"text":"Highlights:  Perfectly cooked meat, somewhat unbalanced flavor profiles (over liked chips, etc).  This should be a restaurant to watch as with a lot of tuning it could be a good place to grab a somewhat upscale taco.   Traditionalists will likely still prefer some place like Maria's as it hits the comfort food niche better but meat lovers will find a lot to love as will people looking for more adventurous and varied offerings."}
{"text":"Poor, Poor, Poor Service. Food was okay but the menu was super confusing (which no one explained) They brought out 3 different trays of the wrong food, took our plates away after having  chips and salsa and then never brought us another one. We asked for napkins and hot sauce, they never came. We asked for the manager, 30 minutes later she started to follow us out the door. The food is not worth the terrible service. Buyer beware of of the mass order of tacos they come out on one plate all at the same time with no explanation of what they are, we even went as far as writing our order on our napkin and still had no clue who's taco was who's."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations! We came here because they seemed to have good gluten-free and vegetarian options. Ooo, boy. The vegan taco was ridiculously good, and the queso a la plancha was something I've never had before and would love to have again. My husband got three tacos: pescado, carnitas, and camaron a la parilla. No complaints from him, and he devoured them. The drinks were great. I loved the gin and mousse, and hubs enjoyed the honey vodka Moscow mule. We finished off with a half order of churros, which tasted hot and fresh out the kitchen."}
{"text":"The tacos are really tasty and the ambiance is super young and cool. A really nice place to chill, eat tacos, watch sports, and listen to hip hop on a Taco Tuesday. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the service was lacking. 2 customers and 6 employees... and some how there were long gaps in acknowledgment and attention. Very aggravating with that ratio of customers to servers."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last night to check out the new place in the neighborhood. They apparently have a few days of soft openings until being officially open. We wandered in Sunday evening and sat at the bar. Nice cocktail list and some good craft beers on tap. The bar staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. We had a good time dining there.  The food was outstanding. Their street taco menu is kind of sushi style, as they say. The tacos are al a carte and there are starters as well. We had the brussel sprouts (awesome, with a great dipping sauce). Every taco we had was incredible. We had the pork belly, lamb, beef tongue, beef cheek, and carnitas. (Don't worry, they have classics as well if you're not quite as adventurous).   The atmosphere was great. They had a big outdoor dining area and bar in addition to tables inside. Great food and a really fun environment. Highly recommended. They're still working out the bar menu but it will include tequila and whiskey flights in addition to their cocktails, beers, etc."}
{"text":"Cool little spot! Tasty tacos and yummy watermelon arugula salad. Guacamole was good but not too special so I wouldn't need to order it again. Upbeat music, cool Frida mural, indoor/outdoor bar seating, and ordering tacos sushi style - make for fun, chill vibes. I enjoyed myself here and the food was good. Especially the grilled mahi mahi \"taco of the day\" (and I don't even usually care for mahi mahi).  I'd definitely return!"}
