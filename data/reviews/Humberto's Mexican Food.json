{"text":"LOVE the California Burrito. The place needs a Restaurant Makeover pronto! The charge for the debit machine should be eliminated. Nobody carries cash anymore. Include it in the price of the items so as to disguise it. It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth every time I have to use my card there. The guys are always friendly and say a genuine \"thank you\" every time I go there. I have tried a few other menu items and all are very good, but I gotta have my California Burrito with a side of guac & pico de gallo!"}
{"text":"This place closed down.  Big sadface.  They had great carne asada.  No idea what became of it."}
{"text":"Good thing this place is open late at night.  Food here is excellent, and doesn't taste burnt or overcooked like most berto places. 

They do charge a fee to use a credit card here so I would bring cash."}
{"text":"I go here often since its close to my house. Like some others have said, its not the cleanest place ever, but for a bertos, its not bad at all... I mean if you're going to a bertos in the first place, you can't really expect it to be super clean. I like their Carne Asada... minus one star because I wish they had salsa."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I am a bit of a Mexicanfoodaholic, I could pretty much eat Mexican food 3 times a day and 4 on nights that we go out drinking. 
I cannot say enough good things about Humberto's.   I have to say for a \"Quick Service\" Mexican food experience it doesn't get much better than this.  I have never been disappointed and I have tried quite a few items on the menu.  My personal favorite is the Machaca (it is amazing) and it keeps me coming back again and again.  The staff is very nice and accomodating.  The seating is not the most comfortable but the food is soooo good that you will finish before you have a chance to notice..."}
{"text":"My friend lives walking distance from here, so we like to reward ourselves with carne asada fries and an horchata every time we come, even when we drive. Gosh darn, they are addictive! 
If you don't know what they are its simple: take ordinary french fries and add carne asada, guacamole, sour cream and cheese! Heaven on a Styrofoam plate! 

However, if thats not quite your speed, they have a melody of other wonderful mexican food! Try the breakfast burrito! Even the one without meet! its delicious!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican Food, but a little on the pricey side for a taco shop."}
{"text":"This place isn't too far from my home and I always saw it on my way to work and wanted to try it sometime.  Yesterday I decided I wanted some tacos and decided to stop for lunch.  Unfortunately, I can not comment on the food as it never got that far.

I placed my order for 2 carne asada tacos and chips.  While I was paying a man came in from outside, talking on his cell phone and walked into the kitchen.  He put the phone away and and started making my tacos.  He didn't touch the meat or veggies but did touch numerous surfaces and use his bare hands on the tortillas.  I asked for my money back and left.

I know these types of restaurants are not the cleanest places but they did not even make an effort at hygiene and sanitation.  Them doing this right in front of the customer makes me question what goes on when you're not there to see."}
{"text":"Authentic!!!! Its the real deal! The chips and salsa...ORDER IT - a MUST HAVE! The only thing I wished for was a Corona beer to drink with it...but I was happy with the fresh cold jamaica.Great flavor...great service... VERY good local food...not fancy..but definitely worth the stop! The breakfast burritos are great as were the carnitas...! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a week and found this place wanting a breakfast burrito.  Ended up coming back 2 more times. Great value for the money.  I should've tried dinner.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"There are so many \"Berto's\" in Phoenix that it's not even funny.  Humberto's is next door to my rinky dink apartment.  So it's convenient.  I went in expecting to find a typical dive.  However, this place was clean and there was a lone man in there manning the grill.  I immediately ordered my \"safe\" meal - a Carne Asada Burrito. I was happy to see the man toss some raw meat onto the grille and make it fresh.  He took great care in putting chili in it and then slapped it into a huge tortilla.  He also put a MOUNTAIN of guacamole into it which was the only downfall.  I will next time as for cheese instead.  So, I ate it and it was good.  It was very big and filling as well.  I will be returning to this place time and time again!"}
{"text":"Best horchata ever.

(The food is great too, obviously)

Don't go in expecting much. It is a tiny place in a strip mall... kinda feels like it was a Subway in a previous life. I've only ever seen one dude working in there, so it wasn't super quick, but we loved it and sneak by to pick up horchata and enchiladas anytime we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I only had tacos, but they were AWESOME.  Better than any other -bertos or restaurant.  I will dream of those tacos."}
{"text":"I used to rock this joint on lunch at Moon Valley High School across the street.  This is the best -bertos type place in the area, not fili b's, not Ramiro's, not Rolando's.

Humberto's.  Best Carne Asada in the area."}
{"text":"Seriously! I don't understand this little place. It's small, hot, cramped and tucked away in a hard to notice place. Thus the 1 star reduction. But the food is out of this world! The Carne Asada is off the chart amazing. If you are close to this place, stop in and order anything. You may have to take and eat it at home or down the street but you won't be disappointed in the least."}
{"text":"Based on my first meal there I can only give 3 starts for now. My 3 star is rating the food, not the complex or the interior. I will explain. 

The complex has been there for 300 years, it was updated once about 150 years ago. There is a Pep Boys, Country Boys, Ghetto Boys (just kidding) there is a MEGA liquidator, a RC Hobby Store, a lawn mower place, a guitar place, car audio and maybe 3 other places. 

The complex is in dire need of cleaning, paint and general upkeep. 

Humbertos is a dive, the interior is sparse and ugly, The decorations are strange and old. The paint is gross, the floor is decent but the entire seating area needs rehab-ed. 

The KITCHEN is Immaculate, I am talking clean. The cook knows that that is his domain and likes it clean like his 67 Impala. 

The food was priced reasonably, I had carne asada quesidilla, Ryan had pork and chicken tacos. The food was good. Right on par with other bertos, nothing stood out as bad or as excellent. 

The service was friendly and the food arrived quickly. If I were in the area getting my car worked on or picking through the junk at the Mega store, I would go back. I doubt I would go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"My fav Mexican joint is now permanently closwd from the looks of it. Went to get a shrimp burrito and they were closed. Phone number no good either. Sorry to see them go, they were good!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to have some yummy Mexican for the lunch. So disappointed to have average Mexican for lunch. 

Average Mexican Food can still be OK but what turned me off was the sanitary conditions. The cooks would handle food, money and packaging items and never washed their hands once. Unless you count wiping their hands on their jeans washing! 

I was waiting for my food which gave me time to look closely at the restaurant. I always say if the floors, bathrooms and corners of the restaurant are dirty, so is the food handling. I did not go into the bathroom but I did notice a filthy dirty high chair sitting in the corner. 

The guy at the counter was not the friendliest but he got the job done. Going back for more? No thanks!"}
{"text":"I have always found that some of the nicest looking restaurants have the worst food, and the most ghetto hole in the wall joint has the best.

Humberto's keeps my theory alive.

The menu is huge and hard to pick from. I ordered the #3 meal that comes with shredded beef rolled tacos (taquitos) covered in guacamole and shredded cheese, with rice and beans on the side.

The rolled tacos tasted like they were made from scratch that morning. Crispy and delicious. Guacamole was not chunky, more like a thick sauce. But the flavor was spot on, and that's what matters.  Beans were perfect, rice was eh but I am not a big fan of rice anyway.

I couldn't resist getting horchata and it was perfect.

Can't wait to come back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Man!  Every visit to Arizona, I have to visit this place for a breakfast burrito.  Oh Humberto, how I miss you!!  the hot sauce has not flavor to interfer with the fabulous burrito, but it sure brings the heat, and brings out the flavor of the meal itself.  This truly is a most excellent hole-in-the-wall.

Highly recommend Sausage Egg and Cheese burrito, with three doses of hot sauce.  yummmm"}
{"text":"I just moved to north Phoenix and I was used to the mexican restaurants and taco shops in downtown. I looked hard for a mexican food place near home and finally found this tiny little place under the shadows of N 51 and Bell behind a gas station. They serve the best menudo around to cure the hangovers and the best late night appetizers. This place brought all the good taste of awesome made mexican food. 
Note: I would have giving a full 5 star except that the only negative point is:  the close too early during the weekends. 
Congratulations !!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food.  The \"rolled tacos\" aren't very good.  They come from the freezer and aren't fresh.  They are basically those frozen taquitos from Costco.  However, the carne asada tacos are delicious here!  It totally redeemed the place.  I did have to wait a little longer than usual for my food, but there was only one guy working there.  The place is small, but still realtively clean inside.  I will be back for the carne asada."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place so many times. But I'm so happy to know that it's close by!

I went in today, I was so starved, glad that the place was dead. (I knew I'd get my food right away.)
I ordered the Carne Asada burrito, three rolled tacos with Guac and cheese, and a large cup of Horchata.

The rolled tacos were alright. But they slapped on a mountain of guac on top of it, that I overlooked their boringness and enjoyed every bite. (I love guac. D: SO MUCH. Avocados FTW!!!)

I didn't realize how big the carne asada burrito was until I ate almost 2/3rds of it. I almost died, over stuffing myself because it was good, really good. I've had Carne plenty other places before, but this ghetto looking hole in the wall restaurant probably takes the #1 spot for yummiest Carne Asada.

The horchata was... Well, horchata! Very refreshing and helped balance out the flavor of the Carne asada burrito.

The service was good, and quick!

Definitely going back, probably tomorrow or something. Gonna try out the rest of their menu. I'll come back with an update when I've tried half their menu."}
{"text":"Won't be going anywhere else for Carne Asada Fries.... This place makes them perfect. A meal that you would assume is for one, actually can be for two. They pack the to-go box completely with french fries, guacamole, sour cream, and cheese!! It is so good, that it is what I choose everytime we go... which is about 3 - 5 times a month.
Their shrimp burrito, steak/egg/cheese burrito, and egg/cheese/potato burritos are also delicious! 
Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Went here for a breakfast burrito this morning. The place is a total dive, service is very slow, and cost was almost 2x what I'm used to paying, but that was a mighty tasty burrito that was well worth the wait!"}
