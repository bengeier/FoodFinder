{"text":"Good sushi, great prices, fast service. This place has the charming character you only find in a hidden gem hole in the wall sort of restaurant."}
{"text":"First of all don't listen to these 2 reviews. This place is legit. Sushi tastes great and light, not like those ball bearings you get from average places where they tightly pack rice into everything. It's about the fish and its okay to use your hands to eat (sushi was intended to be finger food) Make a reservation at the bar, order the omakasi (sp) and have a friendly conversation with the sushi chefs. My dinner was about 140 tax and tip. Given the quality of the sushi it was worth it. If that's too pricy for you, you can always just order off the menu."}
{"text":"The owner's were rude!  He started screaming at me because I was parked in his \"spot\" when I came to pick up an order.  There was no designation marked for the \"the owner of Zen sushi parking only\"  It was an horrible experience and I will no longer be doing business with them again nor my friends.  If you cannot treat your customers with dignity and respect, You should not be in the hospitality business Jack- Ass!"}
{"text":"The freshest sushi I think I have ever had! The tuna was so tender and the chef is an artist. The place is very humble in appearance but the money is spent on the quality of the seafood. I hope the pictures can give some indication of the quality."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner on a Sunday evening. I was in the Yonge-Eglinton area and I remembered that I'd been wanting to check this place out after seeing a decent amount of good reviews on Yelp.  First of all, it isn't the easiest place to find... It's located at the back of a convenience store and, to the best of my recollection, there is no obvious signage that clearly indicates what this place is called. There is no separate entrance, so you have to go through the convenience store to get to the restaurant.  I was the only person there at 8 PM on a Sunday. I was greeted and seated promptly and a cup of tea (lukewarm and bland) arrived soon after. Although it wasn't busy and I arrived long before closing time, I felt very rushed throughout the entire meal. The hostess came around me if I was ready to order at least 5 times within the first 5 minutes of sitting down. Conversely, after she brought my food, she disappeared completely. No \"how is everything?\" No offer to refill the tea. But then, miraculously, she appeared again as soon as I had finished my plate to clear the table and bring the cheque. No offer of a dessert or anything.  Now the food. I ordered the wakame salad and the volcano roll (salmon, cucumber, masago, tempura bits in a roll topped with spicy salmon). The wakame salad was average. The flavour was very one note, lacking acidity and the roasted savouriness from sesame seeds/sesame oil. The wakame also lacked crunch, which suggested that it had been sitting in the marinade/dressing for way too long. The volcano roll tasted pretty good and it had an appropriate ratio of rice to fish, but the roll was sloppily made and presented on the plate =(  After reading the largely glowing reviews of this place on Yelp, I was kind of disappointed by the food that was pretty average and the service that was pretty poor... Maybe I will return when it's a bit busier and they might actually give a damn."}
{"text":"Always fresh and speedy delivery. Best sushi in the Eglinton area."}
{"text":"Wakame salad is not made in house.  I saw the chef smoke inside while cooking and did not bother to wash his hands..."}
{"text":"After finishing work, i decided to grab some sushi at this place. It's little weird seeing sushi place attached next to convenience store, however i guess they're mostly for takeouts so it doesn't matter much. Got the small sushi  sashimi tray for takeout, and the price was very reasonable.  I liked that they didn't have shit ton of rice on maki unlike many other places, and sashimi cuts were definitely larger as well. It had plenty amount for two. Will probably order more takeout trays from this place in the future."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come in here regularly once every two weeks and I cannot understate how much of a hidden gem this place is.  I was super skeptical of getting sushi from a place connected to a convenience store, but we keep coming back because the quality trumps all of the other spots in the area.  We've tried Tokyo sushi and sushi ocean and they just aren't as good.  The staff are always friendly, they serve you quickly with nice extras like miso soup, and they make up a bit for the atmosphere by playing nice classical music.  Finally, the price is very reasonable and you get good portions!"}
{"text":"Quality is okay, waiting time too, as well as prices, but service is awful, you feel like you're annoying them for real! I thought I would apologized for eating there."}
{"text":"This place is tucked conveniently behind a corner star. The signs outside say take-out and delivery; however, they do appear to have a few tables for people who choose to 'dine in'. Regardless, I knew I wanted to take-out.  Very large sushi menu that has most of the traditional categories. I was craving sushi so ordered the avocado roll, tempura roll and a chicken udon.  The rolls were a little rice, around the seaweed with a large amount in the middle. I was impressed! I have never seen that before and the ingredients were FRESH! The tempura was slightly over cooked but that didn't come through in the taste and provided an extra crunch.  The udon reminded me of my mother's chicken soup. Fresh vegetables (again!), broth that was delicious and not overly salted, and thick, perfectly cooked udon. In fact it was large enough that I have enough for tomorrow.  Overall, if you want sushi to-go and in the area. This place is a strong contender!"}
{"text":"Food is consistently good. Never disappointed, always served quickly and reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Went to Crosstown Zen sushi restaurant for dinner. The restaurant is behind a convenience store and the decor is okay. I have been going to this restaurant for many years and the food is okay, but sometimes it is bland. The service is friendly, but you have to get your own tea. It took a while to get my food because they have a lot of takeout orders to make.  I order the salmon teriyaki along with the dynamite roll. The food was tasty, but not the best sushi I have eaten.  Would I go back? Yes because it is close to where I live and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"amazing! yes it falls apart easily but the quality and flavours are outstanding. the miso soup is my fave. added mushrooms give it a xtra kick. lower in sodium too. i have read a lot of reviews. ive only read about 5% negative. every other sushi place ive been to in yonge/eg area has been poor. thi one is probably in my top5 in toronto."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi spot in Toronto. Cheap, and amazing sushi. I order out and dine in almost once a week here and have never had a bad experience yet. The staff are so friendly, and the renovations over the last year have continually added to the cozyness. Still holds my number one vote for sushi in Toronto! (And I'm from Vancouver so I'd like to think I have good taste in sushi)."}
{"text":"This is one expensive sushi takeout restaurant... miso soup was borderline warm and bland and the portion size is like a snack. Id probably have to pay atleast $30 to get a good fill, with that kind of money any other sushi restaurant wouldve given a nice full meal and more. Not recommended unless this was last resort."}
{"text":"The sushi at Crosstown Zen Sushi is disgusting. Definitely one of the worst sushi experiences I've ever had. I've never made sushi before, but if I did, I'm sure I could come up with better sushi than this place. It felt like sushi was made by a blindfolded 5 year old.  The miso soup tasted nothing like miso. It had a different colour (bright orange) and the taste was completely off. The sushi was sloppily made. The whole thing fell apart as soon as you picked it up with your chopsticks. When you bit into it, it became a big ol' mess in your mouth. There was absolutely no contrast in textures and flavours. The fish tasted awful and the consistency made me want to gag.  Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Great sushi at great prices. Simple, focused on takeout, but we've eaten there and has a nice time."}
