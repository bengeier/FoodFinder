{"text":"Was at \"The House\" today and enjoyed their tacos and also the yummy cauliflower.   My friend ordered the cheesecake for dessert and it's one of the best I've tasted - light, delicious and a tasty crust.  Great atmosphere as well - will be back!"}
{"text":"Had an meal here. We were two families with young children. Arrived around 5. Drink orders were taken swiftly and appetizers followed quickly. Sadly, nothing else about our experience there was swift.  Our server was pleasant enough but every step of our dining process took longer than typical. He did not ask for options for kids meals and did not offer dessert (that comes with the meal). Food was average. Beef brisket had nice smokey flavour but was extremely fatty. Chicken fingers were dry and overfried, and left uneaten by my toddler. Fish and chips were just okay but better places for that nearby.   All in all, not keen to return. And definitely not with kids! Service for families was superior at Against the Grain.  It's too bad as it is a nice space."}
{"text":"So excited there is a new bar/restaurant in the Leaside neighbourhood that will keep me coming back. Great food, awesome service by Jeanine she is the best! Had the fish tacos fantastic, wife had the chicken fingers. They looked so good I had to take a bite, glad I did they were top shelf. Definitely will come back again and again."}
{"text":"I have somewhat mixed feelings about this restaurant, but when it comes right down to it, the burger was really good, the service was great, and the place has a very good atmosphere. Some of the smaller things diminished the experience a bit, but not enough to give them any less than 4 stars.  I highly recommend the Smokehouse Burger. With a good sized 8oz patty, some great smoked cheese, bacon, and a huge onion ring on it, it was absolutely delicious. I splurged for the Parmesan fries to go with it, and although they were good, the extra $4 to add a bit of cheese and oil to what I considered to be a small portion of fries to begin with, just wasn't worth it.  The restaurant itself has great ambiance, and everything looks top notch. I would gladly host a business meeting here. The service was also top notch. Prompt and friendly, with some good information, and regular check ins that were well timed and unobtrusive."}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would be better than the lakeshore outlet and it is in some respects. Mainly the design, which is gorgeous set up themed with wood, barrels, fire places, and a few TVs. It's modern but cozy at the same time. Very family friendly will always keep this as a viable option for those with kids as it's gives parents to have some nice beers when out with the kids. The food, unfortunately, is no different from a chain like Kelsey's so if that's your thing, you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Food was too salty, chicken dry and over cooked.  Half our party felt ill shortly afterwards. Service was good and it's a lovely space.  Nice idea separating the family dining section."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and for someone with multiple allergies they were very accommodating. Our waitress, Sarah was fabulous! She was so super sweet and when I couldn't eat any of the desserts took it upon herself to bring me something I could have.  I would definitely come back here and recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"We came by to try this restaurant. It's been open for awhile this year but I always just past by. The interior is modern rustic. Similar layout to former Against the Grain. Service was fast and friendly. We were told the menu had revelry been updated for spring. I liked the options on the menu. They have brunch on weekends and holidays. We ordered the honey sriracha wings, brisket dinner and drinks. Also a kids fish and chips. They have a kids menu which had good options. Wings were quite hot and not as described by waiter. Brisket dinner was. I've. Came with Brussels sprouts, freshly made coleslaw, baked beans and cornbread. The kids fish and chips was a good size. Ordered the vegetables for the kids side and this came out all charred. Not really a kids option. We asked and got this promptly replaced by fries. Clean and spacious atmosphere. Family friendly. The white and milk chocolate cookie with the kids meal is amazing. Overall good neighborhood restaurant with menu good options."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Amsterdam Brewery, their 3 speed is the best light beer I've ever had. I know they already have a successful restaurant in the harbourfront area so I was very excited to see what Barrel House has to offer. To start, the interior is simply stunning. The different lights, furniture and decor create a unique ambiance that I've never felt before. The beer was excellent and they have 9$ beer flights (amazing!). I tried the Richmond & John which had the 3 speed, raspberry wheat, light ale blonde and adventure brew which happened to be the hell which had a citrusy undertone.  I took a recommendation from a good friend to order the buffalo cauliflower which ended up being super tasty! I'm not someone who's into buffalo sauce so this dish really changed me. It was beer battered, deep fried cauliflower chunks, lightly tossed in a subtle buffalo sauce, then laid on a bed of creamy ranch dressing. So definitely would recommend ordering this! I also tried the butternut squash ravioli. I actually ordered this dish without reading the description so when it came I was pretty impressed! It looked like something that would come out of a five star restaurant. Giant ravioli pieces, tossed in a thin pesto, topped with juicy mushrooms, sundried tomatoes and fried batter pieces. I probably wouldn't order this for myself next time because of the portion size (great value for what you pay), and order this as a share plate with friends (very easy to split up). Overall great experience here, they've only been open for a short period now and it's honestly getting a lot of traction! I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"been a fan of Amsterdam for 20 plus years...started down on Portland and have always said Downtown Brown is one of the best beers in the world...Barrel House has good food and service but please don't bring me a beer in a brewery that cost $8 plus with an inch missing in the glass...it's insulting and starts the experience off on the wrong foot. Not the first time it's happened here either. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We were craving burgers and had heard very positive things about the Brisket Burger at Amsterdam. They turned out to be more like charcoal briquette burgers. They were both quite black. We thought this was the way Amsterdam cooks burgers so we didn't complain and just figured we wouldn't return. I later showed the photo to a frequent Amsterdam patron and was told these black burgers were not like any they've ever had. I contacted Amsterdam and was told someone would get back to me. It's 1 1/2 week's later and no contact."}
{"text":"Here for lunch. Great portions and great beer. Wonton nachos rocked...burger was huge. Service was awesome 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"This was by far the best lunch special I have had in a while. The food is slightly different and little more upscale from the Amsterdam brewery downtown by the harbourfront.  The food was amazing! I had the schnitzel lunch special for $14 and let me tell you it was on point! It had the right amount of potatoes and veggies but tasted like it was worth $30/plate.  A friend of mine had the brisket dinner and it was surpringly very flavorful and not dry at all!  The best part of the day was our server, Nathan, he was by far the best server I have ever dealt with in a while. Very attentive, funny, bubbly and full of joy....you don't see that often in Toronto.  I will definitely come back again and try other dishes :)"}
{"text":"Two stars for great service and ambience however, the food was one of the worst I had in Toronto. Lunch portions were very small. Potatoes were not even cooked through..fries were cold. Dose not even deserve another visit. Local restaurant nearby is so  much better!"}
{"text":"I have been to Amsterdam Barrel House twice. The first time I went the service was amazing. The staff were helpful land letting us know which items were the best to try out. The food tasted soo good!!! The second time I went, that's wasn't the case. They seem to have some sort of office/holiday party in the main bar area when entering. There was no hostess nor waitress in sight for more than 10-15 mins. There was no sign saying there restaurant was close. Finally, one of the staff finally came and sat us to a table beside the holiday office party which I didn't like because I could hear any conversation I had with my friends; and again why would you place us beside a loud office holiday party.  Food: I would say the appetizer is better than the main, yet they cost pretty much the same.  The best food here is the Buffalo Cauliflower, Wonton Nacho, Yam Fries, sweet chilli chicken.   The Ontario brisket cheese burger was okay, it tasted very dry. The Korean pulled pork tacos and sandwich was awful the second time around. They didn't have any sort of sauce on it. It tasted like water down slaw and very soggy pork and the whole thing was a mess.    I would come back again for the appetizer but the service really turn me off so I'm not too sure if I would return."}
{"text":"This our second visit here. I previously had a great mushroom burger and salad and fries. It was really good. The yam fries were excellent.  This time tonite my wife had a quinoa salad with salmon that was really small.  My brisket sandwich was like a slider and hardly any meat. The smallest portion I had ever expected. The house salad was quite tasty though. I am still hungry, so maybe a dessert will fill me but the $14.50 brisket, and salad for $7.00 . The apple crumble was so small and I am still hungry.  Oh well. I thought it may have been a real go to new place for us but ,alas no. Don't come here hungry. You will leave hungry , and lighter in your pocket book:("}
{"text":"For a franchise restaurant, there's nothing about this place that I hate. The food was decent with a good variety of ciders and wines to choose from. I was organizing a large event, so getting a person on the phone was tough in the planning stages.   Our bill should've been covered (and was requested to be) by the card i left on file, but was presented to someone at the table at the end of the night so that was annoying. Service was steady and there was a fireplace so good new addition to Leaside area."}
{"text":"This was againts the grain before. I liked their new interior made mostly of wood. We went here on a Friday night and they're pretty busy. I don't think you will need reservations though because we didn't made any. Everyone comes here, whether they're a group of friends, couples, families, even grandmothers get tagged along. It's not for the beer but for the food. I'm honestly not impressed with the beer but I liked the food. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich and my partner ordered the fish and chips which is really boring but it's not that bad. The sandwich was really good though. The beef is very tasty and the bread is soft and sweet. Anyway, I won't come back for the beer but I will surely come back for the food."}
{"text":"The ambiance and decor is very appealing, and the service is great. The menu is very unique and the kitchen is accommodating with special requests. I really like all that I had (Buffalo cauliflower, brisket burger) it was prepared and presented fantastically. I wanted to try everything that I looked at on the menu but I guess I'll just have to come back. Definitely recommend!   Mmmmm"}
