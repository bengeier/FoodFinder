{"text":"Great place just near the Mt. Pleasant GO station. Good food at great prices and large portions. I end up eating from here at least twice a week due to the convenient location. Chicken biryani for $5 and shami kebabs for $1.75 each are my favourite. They don't prepare all items on the menu everyday so call before you get there. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I usually order biryani , achari chicken and beef kabobs here.  They are awesome.  As good as it gets!!! If you want authentic Indian/Pakistani food, then you must try them.  I usually take out instead of dining in."}
{"text":"Got shaami kebabs takeout from them a few weeks ago. The kebabs were okay, nothing special. The location is very convenient; just a stone's throwaway from Mount Pleasant Go station. The prices are reasonable too. Will be back to try their Biryani sometime."}
