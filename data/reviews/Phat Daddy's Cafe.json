{"text":"With the staff being as friendly as they are I feel bad about only giving it two stars but that's exactly what it is, mediocre of not less than mediocre. For a small restaurant I wouldn't expect the food to be like cafeteria food but that's exactly what it is. Anything fried on the menu is pretty good but once you stray from the fried items, be prepared to be eating green beans straight out of the can and food from a box.   If the food was more like Omega's down the road, then I'd be more of a regular at Phat Daddy's but I wasn't impressed by the food. The staff, yes, but not the food."}
{"text":"Good service, food , variety & prices. Do not miss this place"}
{"text":"This is a great local place to eat, They cook to order, so you have to wait a little bit and that is how we like it. Friendly people make you feel special."}
{"text":"This is the first time we've had a bad experience with a place so highly recommended on Yelp. The pot roast was cooked well but bland. Corn and Limas were straight out of a can. Mashed potatoes were cold. Fried squash was bland.  The tea tasted like it was a couple days old."}
{"text":"Great place if you are looking for a \"homey\" small town feel. Cute atmosphere but generally elderly people around lunch time. The food was good and well priced.  The wait staff is friendly and upbeat. I will continue to dine here."}
{"text":"This place is only getting one star because our waitress was nice. We had never been here before and we walk in and the three people standing there just stare at us. Once we sat down some lady barked at us...what do you want to drink? Well ma'am...I barely sat down. Thankfully she was just getting our drinks not our order. The actual waitress came and was very kind even though she messed up my order. We ordered the philly and the burger. Burger was squished flat as paper, burnt, and zero flavor. The philly had no flavor and there was something grissly in one of the bites. I guess you get what you paid for. We will never be back and if someone asks me I will tell them to starve rather than eat there."}
{"text":"We were very impressed with this new place. The food was very, very good and the prices were just as good. Gotta go back. I want to try everything on the menu that I can. I had their meatloaf and I have to say that there isn't many places that I have enjoyed their meatloaf but this one was as good as I have had. The wife had their fried chicken tenders and I got to sample them as well. WOW! I cannot say enough about the flavors of the seasoning and the only drawback is the fact that they do not yet offer fried chicken on the menu. They will they assured me as I am going to hold them to it and they better bread that chicken the same way they do the tenders because they were out of this world. I saw a gentleman sitting net to us in a booth that had a cheeseburger that looked very appealing and overheard just how pleased he was with it and how the flavor was so good. I might have to attack one or two of those my next visit which I hope is very soon."}
{"text":"Walked in.  No sign to seat yourself. Stood at front for 5 minutes as waitress after waitress walked by saying nothing. Cash register unattended. If the waitresses were any slower or any grumpier they'd be dead."}
{"text":"Finally, a great place to eat, that's inexpensive, has great home cooking and something for everyone.  I knew these folks when they worked at Cafe 6100 in the Southpark area, and now they own their own place.  The Phat Daddy burger is huge, flavorful and puts Five Guys to shame.  The pork chops are a specialty, along with the best mac 'n cheese in town.  The cobbler is to die for, and as we've found by visiting on different days, changes daily.  Bottom line is that it's not crowded (at least not yet) and the food is fresh and yummy.  The staff is friendly too!!.  It's hidden away in a small strip center, so it's easy to miss, so slow down when you are near Stallings and Old Monroe Road, or you'll miss it, and some great food too.  Two thumbs, way up!  Kids eat free on Mondays and Wednesdays with adult purchase of $5.00 up.  Tell them Rob sent ya!!"}
{"text":"This place is so easy going, I instantly feel at home. The blackened chicken tips are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Let's see,.... Mediocre food and horrible service.  I have been a patron at this restaurant since it opened as it is 1 block from my job.   I've eaten mostly off of their lunch menu which has included, grilled chicken pitas, various salads including egg salad and burgers.   Their food is flavorless but I've consistently ordered from there in a pinch since it's so close to work. However, due to the complete rudeness of the staff I will no longer be dining from Phat Daddys. Upon this last encounter, I was treated like the biggest inconvenience when I arrived to pick up my order (this has been a common complaint among my coworkers but I've never directly experienced it). I was ready with card in hand to pay as I am aware that noon is an  exceptionally busy time for any restaurant. Not only did I get an eye roll from the waitress but a snotty reply to the most basic of responses. This was the last straw. If the food was better then I might tolerate it but, honestly, there aren't any redeeming qualities for me except for the location.     It also didn't help that the Pita I ordered was stale and the Chef Salad had an off taste to it.       I guess The Friendly Moose down the street will receive our business from now on."}
{"text":"Wonderful little local place.    Great food and great prices.    Wonderful service and friendly.   Great selection of vegetables , lunch specials,  great breakfast.   Small and easy to get in and out fast !!"}
{"text":"If you have time to lose, this is the place to go. We ordered a simple meal of grilled chicken over rice, pork chops and the side dishes. We were given excuse after excuse, an hour later we received our meal. We told the waitress to put it in a to go box as we were so upset. If I was one to walk out on a place I would have. The re was no apology, no comp, nothing. The food was mediocre. We will never eat dinner there again. A meal that should of taken no longer than 20 minutes max. If I could go lower than a 1 star on service, I would. And you wonder why a business goes under."}
{"text":"I was here for an early morning  breakfast.  I was seated immediately.  I ordered a western omelette.  It was very tasty.  I also had home fries.  Those were cooked very well and good.  I also had 2 pancakes that were fluffy and yummy.  I will definitely return to this spot."}
{"text":"Good food at a very reasonable price.  They have specials for breadfast lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"My Aunt loves this place I took her today for lunch I got the mushrooms Swiss burger and fries it was ok. The service was good. If you review them on facebook unfavorably they will block you so no one can see your review. I'm not sure what kinda shady place does that!"}
{"text":"We had a coupon to go here, so we thought we'd try it.  We're so glad we did...this is going to become a regular place for our family to visit.  Great selection of food on their menu and their from their specials.  Kids eat free on Mondays and Wednesdays, too!  The food was excellent, and the prices are great!!  Beef tips on rice with 2 sides and a roll was $7.95!!  The staff was also very friendly...our server was great and very attentive.  We will definitely frequent Phat Daddy's for lunch and dinner...and I can't wait to try breakfast, too."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting. The server was very good BUT The food was awful. I've never had bacon that tasted like nothing until today. Everything was bland. It was to the point that I just ate the food because I was paying and didn't want to waste my money. I would never return. We got a pork chop and they didn't even put salt and pepper on it."}
{"text":"Very friendly , laid back atmosphere.  The building shows wear and tear but overall very clean. Food is simply described on the menu and they have plenty of sides to choose from!!! I ordered my NY steak sandwich medium rare, but unfortunately it was very well done. Service was nice and you can tell the teamwork makes it all happen. All in all , I would come back for the service , but the food needs a little work."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced. Warm and friendly service. Topped the evening pork chop meal with delicious apple cobbler and ice cream."}
{"text":"Quick, easy, pretty yummy and cheap. What else could you ask for? This is a great place to have lunch or breakfast. I work close to here and can see meeting friends and family during my lunch break to be a regular thing! Really happy to find a good little place like this especially when all the other food places in the area are pretty yuck."}
{"text":"I have eaten several different times and didn't enjoy any of them. The food isn't gross or anything, it just doesn't have any flavor. It tastes like I'm paying for air flavored food. My most recent visit was mid May and I came here to get lunch with a friend. It was pretty busy since it was lunch time but we were still able to find somewhere to seat ourselves. She ordered a steak with green beans and I decided to go with chicken strips with banana pudding and fried okra as my two sides. I'm not exactly sure if the menu specified what sort of steak it was but when my friend realized it was a Salisbury steak, she was very disappointed. She also said the green beans were definitely canned. My chicken strips were tasteless. Ranch came to the rescue but I had to practically drown my chicken in the sauce. The fried okra was crunchy and you can taste the okra but it didn't taste like they seasoned it at all. Then came the banana pudding.. I had high hopes and they were crushed. It actually took a long time for it to come out and ended up tasting store bought.   Our waiter did a good job at being attentive. He made sure our drinks stayed full and asked us about the food often. It wasn't his fault that the food was disappointing and we didn't want to be that customer to complain so we didn't. But I most likely will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. If you dine in prepare for slow service and an attitude from the wait staff. Definitely not a very friendly staff. If they are busy it's best to walk out and go somewhere else. It will take way too long to get your food or even a refill of your drink.  They food is alright. Not a place for healthy food options. I recommend getting take out if you're willing to blow your calories on their food."}
{"text":"Perfectly prepared fried eggs. Delicious and peppery sausage-gravy on a fluffy and large biscuit. Crispy bacon and sizzling sausage patty. I had the Big Phat Daddy's breakfast combo and it was spot-on. The hash browns were just \"ok\" and the coffee a standard diner coffee or I would have given 5 stars. My wife had the veggie omelette and it was also Very Good!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! I read some reviews and I don't know what day these people came in, but for me this is one of those gold mines hidden under mixed reviews. To qualify my statement I have run multiple kitchens in fine dining establishments. I came in for a late breakfast and was not disappointed. Simple yet scrumptious is how I would describe the meal. I had a custom omelette as well as biscuits and gravy. My girlfriend had the Big Daddy Special and it was great. Honestly, this place has a nice relaxing & friendly atmosphere as well as delicious food. Come try it out!"}
{"text":"Food taste like it's either been frozen for months or came straight from a can. Service isn't much better.. most of the ladies seem to either hate their job or don't care about their paying customers."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! My friend was craving a burger and insisted on coming here! What a great choice! It's very affordable and the service is fantastic! They make you feel like you are apart of their family!"}
{"text":"Can you excellent customer service . I am new to the area and was dying for something other than fast food burger. So I looked on yelp and found this diamond in the rough . The cashier was super nice and respectful to every customer, I didn't know what to order so I got the buffalo wing dinner with Mac and cheese and green beans cornbread. The cornbread wasn't my favorite but the Mac tasted great and the wings were perfect . I also order a cheeseburger meal which taste great, the portion were well worth the money, will go back again soon . Great prices"}
{"text":"Came here looking for a good dive diner. Got here and received frozen food on top of slow service. Didn't get checked on to see if we needed anything. The place has a lot of potential, they just need to start using fresh product. I don't know if it's because I went to culinary school or what but I saw no good happening at this time."}
{"text":"First off, walking in from outside, Phat Daddy's doesn't look like much, but when you come inside, the ambiance is pretty nice. Your greeted by a friendly older hostess and your told you can sit anywhere.  The look is pretty cool, it's a diner, within a restaurant. There was tables and booths, we got a booth and our server \"Sincer\" was attentive. Food was good, and I liked that you can mix and match and there is a lot of options. Great pricing too. One thing is that it's a little too greasy for my taste."}
{"text":"We found this place based on its good Yelp reviews, and were not disappointed. It's clean and pleasant inside and out, and features down-home cooking at great prices. The service has been exemplary each time (we've been there 3 times now, and had the same super-nice and attentive waiter every time.) It's also very kid-friendly, which is good for families, and kids eat free on Mondays and Wednesday lunch and dinner.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the food is a *touch* on the greasy side, so I always seem to find myself feeling it later. Obviously that doesn't bother me too much, though, given that I've been there 3 times in about 3 weeks... but I would just give fair warning that this isn't health food."}
{"text":"Great food but when ever I call in an order they with out fail always mess it up which is very frustrating"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to get a quick meal Friday night with my three kids. Passed this place by many times so thought I'd give it a try. Glad I did and will be back. Two kids had cheese burgers w/ onion rings and ff. Onion rings had very crispy corn meal batter, not at all greasy. Other child's chicken tenders had a light, crispy batter with tender moist meat. My dish, 6 wing platter was very good. Crispy skin outside , tender, moist meat inside. Sweet potato casserole was yummy and very good cole slaw. Our waitress seemed to be the only one on shift so service was a bit slow, but not her fault. Meal totaled about $ 33 for the 4 of us. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place for breakfast and stopped in here. We had been once before for lunch and enjoyed it. The breakfast menu was good. I ordered the western omelette with grits and a biscuit. The omelette was good but the fresh, fluffy warm biscuit was amazing and that's coming from someone who doesn't like biscuits. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The decor is a little run down and dark. Overall, an ok experience."}
{"text":"The appetizers were so yummy and affordable that 3 of those were my dinner. Fried pickles, fried zucchini and homemade onion rings. Good portions. My husband ordered the bologna sandwich which he said he'd order again.   Nice atmosphere, great staff...lots of personality. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a chance to try this place out the other day for lunch. What a find!! I liked it! It's tucked away in a tiny strip mall in Stallings. They had all kinds of home cooked meals on the menu. I got the Phat Daddy burger (recommended by the server). Double patty w/ cheese, lettuce & tomato & a side of onion rings. Fresh and filling. One particular thing I liked about the assembly of the burger; the lettuce & tomato were fresh & cold while the patties were steaming hot (nothing worse than limp lettuce). The onion rings were pretty good but I've had better. The batter was a little thick. My wife got the BLT which she really enjoyed. They offer plenty of sides to choose from too. This place is also very affordable. Two for lunch, under $15 bucks. Not too shabby. Yes, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I saw another review on here that this place is hit or miss...for us it was a definite miss!! We were in the Matthews area for an appointment and thought we would stop by here to grab a bite to eat...now I wish we had gone elsewhere. When you walk in, there is no sign to seat yourself so you stand around awkwardly until someone walking by tells you to find a table. After we sat down, a server came up and took our food and drink order...that was the last time we ever saw our server on the floor until we got our check. Someone else brought our food and they had forgotten part of my order. When we told her that I was missing my toast, there was no response, she just walked into the back nonchalantly. We had no idea if she had heard us because of her lack of acknowledgement. Five minutes later, my toast came out, so apparently she had heard me. The food itself was mediocre...nothing to write home about but about what we were expecting. However, when we needed drink refills, neither our server nor the food runner were anywhere to be found. The restaurant had one saving grace...one server who was running his butt off serving almost all of the tables. He saw that we needed a refill and even though our table was not his, he stopped what he was doing and refilled the drink. He is the sole reason this review is two stars and not one. Before we got our check, I had to use the restroom...to get to there, you have to walk through the back, which brings you past what I can only assume is their freezer. I felt like I was walking through someone's basement. The bathroom itself felt like one of those gas station bathrooms where you stop at some remote gas station and they have to give you a key to use the facilities. I went back to the table afterwards and we sat around for a few minutes before our original server finally came back out and almost seemed surprised that we were ready to leave and wanted our check. Upon checking out, we wanted to leave two tips...one for our server (even though she literally only wrote down our order and gave us our check) and one for the server who gave us our refill when he was already busy with every other table in the restaurant. We wanted to let him know that we appreciated and acknowledged his hard work when everyone else was moving in slow motion (or had completely disappeared). The lady at the register acted like she was appalled and irritated that we would do that. She told us that our first server went on break and that's why we didn't see her. Not our problem! If she needed a break, then she shouldn't have taken our table. If we are ever in the Matthews area again, we will *not* be back, and I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on Sunday after church. Place was crowded but we were seated within 10 minutes.  We placed our orders and the wait began.  It was exactly one hour before our food came out.  It was cold and not that good. Pancakes tasted premade and frozen. Bacon and sausage is what we expect for the cheap price.  My boiled eggs were ice cold.  On top of that service was lacking .  Maybe they were just too busy and not prepared for the rush, but we won't be back.  I saw people getting lunch, maybe that's a better choice."}
{"text":"This small stallings secret is a great place to go for a quick breakfast or lunch. The staff is super friendly, the food is fantastic for how affordable it is and FAST! Overall, really good spot."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path in a nook of Stallings, NC, Phat Daddy's Cafe is a quaint little diner-esque stop for decent value and good food.  Don't be thrown off or intimidated by it's overly eye-roll worthy name, the cafe itself is a homey place you can bring your parents too for Sunday afternoon brunch.  My son and I crushed some breakfast here the other day and were happy with the service, the food, and the cleanliness of the establishment.  It's definitely not a show-stopper type place, but to be fair, it's really not trying to be.  The real standout is the value.  You'll definitely walk away with more weight added to your belly than was taken away from your wallet."}
{"text":"A good ol', down-home cafe, although I've only been for breakfast.  Great service, good food.  I especially like the pancakes.  Great prices, too.  Save yourself the trouble of waiting in line at IHOP when you can enjoy a local spot.  I do find the name odd for this place.  It made me wonder if it was Asian food or some chic kinda name that I'm too outta touch to understand, but don't let that scare you off.  Would I go back?... Already have."}
{"text":"I get out to this part of the city from time to time, due to work.  I am always looking for good eats as I negotiate my day.  I had heard of this family style restaurant from a friend.  I love it.  Real cooking by real people.  Apparently the owners worked at another establishment Charlotte restaurant for over 10 years before taking the plunge and opening Phat Daddy's Cafe a little over six months ago.  This is just the sort of value I look for in a lunch restaurant.   I shall report back when I attempt the Dinner fare... Support your local small business!!"}
{"text":"Used to go with my co workers for lunch a lot. The food is good and prices are reasonable."}
